And as the faint light of his course\r\npierced into the dwellings of men, it fell, as now, on the rosy warmth\r\nof nestling children; on the haggard waking of sorrow and sickness; on\r\nthe hasty uprising of the hard-handed labourer; and on the late sleep\r\nof the night-student, who had been questioning the stars or the sages,\r\nor his own soul, for that hidden knowledge which would break through\r\nthe barrier of man\xe2\x80\x99s brief life, and show its dark path, that seemed to\r\nbend no whither, to be an arc in an immeasurable circle of light and\r\nglory. The great river-courses which have shaped the lives of men have\r\nhardly changed; and those other streams, the life-currents that ebb and\r\nflow in human hearts, pulsate to the same great needs, the same great\r\nloves and terrors. As our thought follows close in the slow wake of the\r\ndawn, we are impressed with the broad sameness of the human lot, which\r\nnever alters in the main headings of its history\xe2\x80\x94hunger and labour,\r\nseed-time and harvest, love and death.\r\n\r\nEven if, instead of following the dim daybreak, our imagination pauses\r\non a certain historical spot and awaits the fuller morning, we may see\r\na world-famous city, which has hardly changed its outline since the\r\ndays of Columbus, seeming to stand as an almost unviolated symbol,\r\namidst the flux of human things, to remind us that we still resemble\r\nthe men of the past more than we differ from them, as the great\r\nmechanical principles on which those domes and towers were raised must\r\nmake a likeness in human building that will be broader and deeper than\r\nall possible change. And doubtless, if the spirit of a Florentine\r\ncitizen, whose eyes were closed for the last time while Columbus was\r\nstill waiting and arguing for the three poor vessels with which he was\r\nto set sail from the port of Palos, could return from the shades and\r\npause where our thought is pausing, he would believe that there must\r\nstill be fellowship and understanding for him among the inheritors of\r\nhis birthplace.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that such a Shade has been permitted to revisit the\r\nglimpses of the golden morning, and is standing once more on the famous\r\nhill of San Miniato, which overlooks Florence from the south.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit is clothed in his habit as he lived: the folds of his\r\nwell-lined black silk garment or _lucco_ hang in grave unbroken lines\r\nfrom neck to ankle; his plain cloth cap, with its _becchetto_, or long\r\nhanging strip of drapery, to serve as a scarf in case of need,\r\nsurmounts a penetrating face, not, perhaps, very handsome, but with a\r\nfirm, well-cut mouth, kept distinctly human by a close-shaven lip and\r\nchin. It is a face charged with memories of a keen and various life\r\npassed below there on the banks of the gleaming river; and as he looks\r\nat the scene before him, the sense of familiarity is so much stronger\r\nthan the perception of change, that he thinks it might be possible to\r\ndescend once more amongst the streets, and take up that busy life where\r\nhe left it. For it is not only the mountains and the westward-bending\r\nriver that he recognises; not only the dark sides of Mount Morello\r\nopposite to him, and the long valley of the Arno that seems to stretch\r\nits grey low-tufted luxuriance to the far-off ridges of Carrara; and\r\nthe steep height of Fiesole, with its crown of monastic walls and\r\ncypresses; and all the green and grey slopes sprinkled with villas\r\nwhich he can name as he looks at them. He sees other familiar objects\r\nmuch closer to his daily walks. For though he misses the seventy or\r\nmore towers that once surmounted the walls, and encircled the city as\r\nwith a regal diadem, his eyes will not dwell on that blank; they are\r\ndrawn irresistibly to the unique tower springing, like a tall\r\nflower-stem drawn towards the sun, from the square turreted mass of the\r\nOld Palace in the very heart of the city\xe2\x80\x94the tower that looks none the\r\nworse for the four centuries that have passed since he used to walk\r\nunder it. The great dome, too, greatest in the world, which, in his\r\nearly boyhood, had been only a daring thought in the mind of a small,\r\nquick-eyed man\xe2\x80\x94there it raises its large curves still, eclipsing the\r\nhills. And the well-known bell-towers\xe2\x80\x94Giotto\xe2\x80\x99s, with its distant hint\r\nof rich colour, and the graceful-spired Badia, and the rest\xe2\x80\x94he looked\r\nat them all from the shoulder of his nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d he thinks, \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence can still ring her bells with the solemn\r\nhammer-sound that used to beat on the hearts of her citizens and strike\r\nout the fire there. And here, on the right, stands the long dark mass\r\nof Santa Croce, where we buried our famous dead, laying the laurel on\r\ntheir cold brows and fanning them with the breath of praise and of\r\nbanners. But Santa Croce had no spire then: we Florentines were too\r\nfull of great building projects to carry them all out in stone and\r\nmarble; we had our frescoes and our shrines to pay for, not to speak of\r\nrapacious condottieri, bribed royalty, and purchased territories, and\r\nour fa\xc3\xa7ades and spires must needs wait. But what architect can the\r\nFrati Minori (the Franciscans) have employed to build that spire for\r\nthem? If it had been built in my day, Filippo Brunelleschi or\r\nMichelozzo would have devised something of another fashion than\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94something worthy to crown the church of Arnolfo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this the Spirit, with a sigh, lets his eyes travel on to the city\r\nwalls, and now he dwells on the change there with wonder at these\r\nmodern times. Why have five out of the eleven convenient gates been\r\nclosed? And why, above all, should the towers have been levelled that\r\nwere once a glory and defence? Is the world become so peaceful, then,\r\nand do Florentines dwell in such harmony, that there are no longer\r\nconspiracies to bring ambitious exiles home again with armed bands at\r\ntheir back? These are difficult questions: it is easier and pleasanter\r\nto recognise the old than to account for the new. And there flows Arno,\r\nwith its bridges just where they used to be\xe2\x80\x94the Ponte Vecchio, least\r\nlike other bridges in the world, laden with the same quaint shops where\r\nour Spirit remembers lingering a little on his way perhaps to look at\r\nthe progress of that great palace which Messer Luca Pitti had set\r\na-building with huge stones got from the Hill of Bogoli (now Boboli)\r\nclose behind, or perhaps to transact a little business with the\r\ncloth-dressers in Oltrarno. The exorbitant line of the Pitti roof is\r\nhidden from San Miniato; but the yearning of the old Florentine is not\r\nto see Messer Luca\xe2\x80\x99s too ambitious palace which he built unto himself;\r\nit is to be down among those narrow streets and busy humming Piazze\r\nwhere he inherited the eager life of his fathers. Is not the anxious\r\nvoting with black and white beans still going on down there? Who are\r\nthe Priori in these months, eating soberly-regulated official dinners\r\nin the Palazzo Vecchio, with removes of tripe and boiled partridges,\r\nseasoned by practical jokes against the ill-fated butt among those\r\npotent signors? Are not the significant banners still hung from the\r\nwindows\xe2\x80\x94still distributed with decent pomp under Orcagna\xe2\x80\x99s Loggia every\r\ntwo months?\r\n\r\nLife had its zest for the old Florentine when he, too, trod the marble\r\nsteps and shared in those dignities. His politics had an area as wide\r\nas his trade, which stretched from Syria to Britain, but they had also\r\nthe passionate intensity, and the detailed practical interest, which\r\ncould belong only to a narrow scene of corporate action; only to the\r\nmembers of a community shut in close by the hills and by walls of six\r\nmiles\xe2\x80\x99 circuit, where men knew each other as they passed in the street,\r\nset their eyes every day on the memorials of their commonwealth, and\r\nwere conscious of having not simply the right to vote, but the chance\r\nof being voted for. He loved his honours and his gains, the business of\r\nhis counting-house, of his guild, of the public council-chamber; he\r\nloved his enmities too, and fingered the white bean which was to keep a\r\nhated name out of the _borsa_ with more complacency than if it had been\r\na golden florin. He loved to strengthen his family by a good alliance,\r\nand went home with a triumphant light in his eyes after concluding a\r\nsatisfactory marriage for his son or daughter under his favourite\r\nloggia in the evening cool; he loved his game at chess under that same\r\nloggia, and his biting jest, and even his coarse joke, as not beneath\r\nthe dignity of a man eligible for the highest magistracy. He had gained\r\nan insight into all sorts of affairs at home and abroad: he had been of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cTen\xe2\x80\x9d who managed the war department, of the \xe2\x80\x9cEight\xe2\x80\x9d who attended\r\nto home discipline, of the Priori or Signori who were the heads of the\r\nexecutive government; he had even risen to the supreme office of\r\nGonfaloniere; he had made one in embassies to the Pope and to the\r\nVenetians; and he had been commissary to the hired army of the\r\nRepublic, directing the inglorious bloodless battles in which no man\r\ndied of brave breast wounds\xe2\x80\x94_virtuosi colpi_\xe2\x80\x94but only of casual falls\r\nand tramplings. And in this way he had learned to distrust men without\r\nbitterness; looking on life mainly as a game of skill, but not dead to\r\ntraditions of heroism and clean-handed honour. For the human soul is\r\nhospitable, and will entertain conflicting sentiments and contradictory\r\nopinions with much impartiality. It was his pride besides, that he was\r\nduly tinctured with the learning of his age, and judged not altogether\r\nwith the vulgar, but in harmony with the ancients: he, too, in his\r\nprime, had been eager for the most correct manuscripts, and had paid\r\nmany florins for antique vases and for disinterred busts of the ancient\r\nimmortals\xe2\x80\x94some, perhaps, _truncis naribus_, wanting as to the nose, but\r\nnot the less authentic; and in his old age he had made haste to look at\r\nthe first sheets of that fine Homer which was among the early glories\r\nof the Florentine press. But he had not, for all that, neglected to\r\nhang up a waxen image or double of himself under the protection of the\r\nMadonna Annunziata, or to do penance for his sins in large gifts to the\r\nshrines of saints whose lives had not been modelled on the study of the\r\nclassics; he had not even neglected making liberal bequests towards\r\nbuildings for the Frati, against whom he had levelled many a jest.\r\n\r\nFor the Unseen Powers were mighty. Who knew\xe2\x80\x94who was sure\xe2\x80\x94that there was\r\n_any_ name given to them behind which there was no angry force to be\r\nappeased, no intercessory pity to be won? Were not gems medicinal,\r\nthough they only pressed the finger? Were not all things charged with\r\noccult virtues? Lucretius might be right\xe2\x80\x94he was an ancient, and a great\r\npoet; Luigi Pulci, too, who was suspected of not believing anything\r\nfrom the roof upward (_dal tetto in su_), had very much the air of\r\nbeing right over the supper-table, when the wine and jests were\r\ncirculating fast, though he was only a poet in the vulgar tongue. There\r\nwere even learned personages who maintained that Aristotle, wisest of\r\nmen (unless, indeed, Plato were wiser?) was a thoroughly irreligious\r\nphilosopher; and a liberal scholar must entertain all speculations. But\r\nthe negatives might, after all, prove false; nay, seemed manifestly\r\nfalse, as the circling hours swept past him, and turned round with\r\ngraver faces. For had not the world become Christian? Had he not been\r\nbaptised in San Giovanni, where the dome is awful with symbols of\r\ncoming judgment, and where the altar bears a crucified Image disturbing\r\nto perfect complacency in one\xe2\x80\x99s self and the world? Our resuscitated\r\nSpirit was not a pagan philosopher, nor a philosophising pagan poet,\r\nbut a man of the fifteenth century, inheriting its strange web of\r\nbelief and unbelief; of Epicurean levity and fetichistic dread; of\r\npedantic impossible ethics uttered by rote, and crude passions acted\r\nout with childish impulsiveness; of inclination towards a\r\nself-indulgent paganism, and inevitable subjection to that human\r\nconscience which, in the unrest of a new growth, was rilling the air\r\nwith strange prophecies and presentiments.\r\n\r\nHe had smiled, perhaps, and shaken his head dubiously, as he heard\r\nsimple folk talk of a Pope Angelico, who was to come by-and-by and\r\nbring in a new order of things, to purify the Church from simony, and\r\nthe lives of the clergy from scandal\xe2\x80\x94a state of affairs too different\r\nfrom what existed under Innocent the Eighth for a shrewd merchant and\r\npolitician to regard the prospect as worthy of entering into his\r\ncalculations. But he felt the evils of the time, nevertheless; for he\r\nwas a man of public spirit, and public spirit can never be wholly\r\nimmoral, since its essence is care for a common good. That very\r\nQuaresima or Lent of 1492 in which he died, still in his erect old age,\r\nhe had listened in San Lorenzo, not without a mixture of satisfaction,\r\nto the preaching of a Dominican Friar, named Girolamo Savonarola, who\r\ndenounced with a rare boldness the worldliness and vicious habits of\r\nthe clergy, and insisted on the duty of Christian men not to live for\r\ntheir own ease when wrong was triumphing in high places, and not to\r\nspend their wealth in outward pomp even in the churches, when their\r\nfellow-citizens were suffering from want and sickness. The Frate\r\ncarried his doctrine rather too far for elderly ears; yet it was a\r\nmemorable thing to see a preacher move his audience to such a pitch\r\nthat the women even took off their ornaments, and delivered them up to\r\nbe sold for the benefit of the needy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a noteworthy man, that Prior of San Marco,\xe2\x80\x9d thinks our Spirit;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csomewhat arrogant and extreme, perhaps, especially in his\r\ndenunciations of speedy vengeance. Ah, _Iddio non paga il Sabatol_\r\n(\xe2\x80\x98God does not pay on a Saturday\xe2\x80\x99)\xe2\x80\x94the wages of men\xe2\x80\x99s sins often linger\r\nin their payment, and I myself saw much established wickedness of\r\nlong-standing prosperity. But a Frate Predicatore who wanted to move\r\nthe people\xe2\x80\x94how could he be moderate? He might have been a little less\r\ndefiant and curt, though, to Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, whose family had been\r\nthe very makers of San Marco: was that quarrel ever made up? And our\r\nLorenzo himself, with the dim outward eyes and the subtle inward\r\nvision, did he get over that illness at Careggi? It was but a sad,\r\nuneasy-looking face that he would carry out of the world which had\r\ngiven him so much, and there were strong suspicions that his handsome\r\nson would play the part of Rehoboam. How has it all turned out? Which\r\nparty is likely to be banished and have its houses sacked just now? Is\r\nthere any successor of the incomparable Lorenzo, to whom the great Turk\r\nis so gracious as to send over presents of rare animals, rare relics,\r\nrare manuscripts, or fugitive enemies, suited to the tastes of a\r\nChristian Magnifico who is at once lettered and devout\xe2\x80\x94and also\r\nslightly vindictive? And what famous scholar is dictating the Latin\r\nletters of the Republic\xe2\x80\x94what fiery philosopher is lecturing on Dante in\r\nthe Duomo, and going home to write bitter invectives against the father\r\nand mother of the bad critic who may have found fault with his\r\nclassical spelling? Are our wiser heads leaning towards alliance with\r\nthe Pope and the Regno (The name given to Naples by way of distinction\r\namong the Italian States), or are they rather inclining their ears to\r\nthe orators of France and of Milan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is knowledge of these things to be had in the streets below, on\r\nthe beloved _marmi_ in front of the churches, and under the sheltering\r\nLoggie, where surely our citizens have still their gossip and debates,\r\ntheir bitter and merry jests as of old. For are not the well-remembered\r\nbuildings all there? The changes have not been so great in those\r\nuncounted years. I will go down and hear\xe2\x80\x94I will tread the familiar\r\npavement, and hear once again the speech of Florentines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGo not down, good Spirit! for the changes are great and the speech of\r\nFlorentines would sound as a riddle in your ears. Or, if you go, mingle\r\nwith no politicians on the _marmi_, or elsewhere; ask no questions\r\nabout trade in the Calimara; confuse yourself with no inquiries into\r\nscholarship, official or monastic. Only look at the sunlight and\r\nshadows on the grand walls that were built solidly, and have endured in\r\ntheir grandeur; look at the faces of the little children, making\r\nanother sunlight amid the shadows of age; look, if you will, into the\r\nchurches, and hear the same chants, see the same images as of old\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nimages of willing anguish for a great end, of beneficent love and\r\nascending glory; see upturned living faces, and lips moving to the old\r\nprayers for help. These things have not changed. The sunlight and\r\nshadows bring their old beauty and waken the old heart-strains at\r\nmorning, noon, and eventide; the little children are still the symbol\r\nof the eternal marriage between love and duty; and men still yearn for\r\nthe reign of peace and righteousness\xe2\x80\x94still own _that_ life to be the\r\nhighest which is a conscious voluntary sacrifice. For the Pope Angelico\r\nis not come yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nThe Shipwrecked Stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Loggia de\xe2\x80\x99 Cerchi stood in the heart of old Florence, within a\r\nlabyrinth of narrow streets behind the Badia, now rarely threaded by\r\nthe stranger, unless in a dubious search for a certain severely simple\r\ndoorplace, bearing this inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\nQui Nacque Il Divino Poeta.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the ear of Dante, the same streets rang with the shout and clash of\r\nfierce battle between rival families; but in the fifteenth century,\r\nthey were only noisy with the unhistorical quarrels and broad jests of\r\nwoolcarders in the cloth-producing quarters of San Martino and Garbo.\r\n\r\nUnder this loggia, in the early morning of the 9th of April 1492, two\r\nmen had their eyes fixed on each other: one was stooping slightly, and\r\nlooking downward with the scrutiny of curiosity; the other, lying on\r\nthe pavement, was looking upward with the startled gaze of a\r\nsuddenly-awakened dreamer.\r\n\r\nThe standing figure was the first to speak. He was a grey-haired,\r\nbroad-shouldered man, of the type which, in Tuscan phrase, is moulded\r\nwith the fist and polished with the pickaxe; but the self-important\r\ngravity which had written itself out in the deep lines about his brow\r\nand mouth seemed intended to correct any contemptuous inferences from\r\nthe hasty workmanship which Nature had bestowed on his exterior. He had\r\ndeposited a large well-filled bag, made of skins, on the pavement, and\r\nbefore him hung a pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s basket, garnished partly with small\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s-ware, such as thread and pins, and partly with fragments of\r\nglass, which had probably been taken in exchange for those commodities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to a ring on the finger of the reclining\r\nfigure, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen your chin has got a stiffer crop on it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know\r\nbetter than to take your nap in street-corners with a ring like that on\r\nyour forefinger. By the holy \xe2\x80\x99vangels! if it had been anybody but me\r\nstanding over you two minutes ago\xe2\x80\x94but Bratti Ferravecchi is not the man\r\nto steal. The cat couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat her mouse if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch it alive,\r\nand Bratti couldn\xe2\x80\x99t relish gain if it had no taste of a bargain. Why,\r\nyoung man, one San Giovanni, three years ago, the Saint sent a dead\r\nbody in my way\xe2\x80\x94a blind beggar, with his cap well-lined with pieces\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me, my stomach turned against the money I\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nbargained for, till it came into my head that San Giovanni owed me the\r\npieces for what I spend yearly at the Festa; besides, I buried the body\r\nand paid for a mass\xe2\x80\x94and so I saw it was a fair bargain. But how comes a\r\nyoung man like you, with the face of Messer San Michele, to be sleeping\r\non a stone bed with the wind for a curtain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deep guttural sounds of the speaker were scarcely intelligible to\r\nthe newly-waked, bewildered listener, but he understood the action of\r\npointing to his ring: he looked down at it, and, with a half-automatic\r\nobedience to the warning, took it off and thrust it within his doublet,\r\nrising at the same time and stretching himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour tunic and hose match ill with that jewel, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBratti, deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody might say the saints had sent _you_ a\r\ndead body; but if you took the jewels, I hope you buried him\xe2\x80\x94and you\r\ncan afford a mass or two for him into the bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething like a painful thrill appeared to dart through the frame of\r\nthe listener, and arrest the careless stretching of his arms and chest.\r\nFor an instant he turned on Bratti with a sharp frown; but he\r\nimmediately recovered an air of indifference, took off the red\r\nLevantine cap which hung like a great purse over his left ear, pushed\r\nback his long dark-brown curls, and glancing at his dress, said,\r\nsmilingly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak truth, friend: my garments are as weather-stained as an old\r\nsail, and they are not old either, only, like an old sail, they have\r\nhad a sprinkling of the sea as well as the rain. The fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nstranger in Florence, and when I came in footsore last night I\r\npreferred flinging myself in a corner of this hospitable porch to\r\nhunting any longer for a chance hostelry, which might turn out to be a\r\nnest of blood-suckers of more sorts than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stranger, in good sooth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the words come all\r\nmelting out of your throat, so that a Christian and a Florentine can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell a hook from a hanger. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not from Genoa? More likely from\r\nVenice, by the cut of your clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this present moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cit is of less\r\nimportance where I come from than where I can go to for a mouthful of\r\nbreakfast. This city of yours turns a grim look on me just here: can\r\nyou show me the way to a more lively quarter, where I can get a meal\r\nand a lodging?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is your good fortune, young man,\r\nthat I have happened to be walking in from Rovezzano this morning, and\r\nturned out of my way to Mercato Vecchio to say an Ave at the Badia.\r\nThat, I say, is your good fortune. But it remains to be seen what is my\r\nprofit in the matter. Nothing for nothing, young man. If I show you the\r\nway to Mercato Vecchio, you\xe2\x80\x99ll swear by your patron saint to let me\r\nhave the bidding for that stained suit of yours, when you set up a\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x94as doubtless you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed, by San Niccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now let us set\r\noff to this said Mercato, for I feel the want of a better lining to\r\nthis doublet of mine which you are coveting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoveting? Nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, heaving his bag on his back and setting\r\nout. But he broke off in his reply, and burst out in loud, harsh tones,\r\nnot unlike the creaking and grating of a cart-wheel: \xe2\x80\x9c_Chi\r\nabbaratta_\xe2\x80\x94_baratta_\xe2\x80\x94_b\xe2\x80\x99ratta_\xe2\x80\x94_chi abbaratta cenci e vetri_\xe2\x80\x94_b\xe2\x80\x99ratta\r\nferri vecchi_?\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to exchange rags, broken glass, or old\r\niron?\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth but little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently, relapsing into his\r\nconversational tone. \xe2\x80\x9cHose and altogether, your clothes are worth but\r\nlittle. Still, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind to set yourself up with a lute worth\r\nmore than any new one, or with a sword that\xe2\x80\x99s been worn by a Ridolfi,\r\nor with a paternoster of the best mode, I could let you have a great\r\nbargain, by making an allowance for the clothes; for, simple as I stand\r\nhere, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best-furnished shop in the Ferravecchi, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclose by the Mercato. The Virgin be praised! it\xe2\x80\x99s not a pumpkin I carry\r\non my shoulders. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t stay caged in my shop all day: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nwife and a raven to stay at home and mind the stock. _Chi\r\nabbaratta_\xe2\x80\x94_baratta_\xe2\x80\x94_b\xe2\x80\x99ratta_? ... And now, young man, where do you\r\ncome from, and what\xe2\x80\x99s your business in Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you liked nothing that came to you without a bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve offered me nothing yet in exchange for that\r\ninformation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well; a Florentine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind bidding a fair price for news:\r\nit stays the stomach a little though he may win no hose by it. If I\r\ntake you to the prettiest damsel in the Mercato to get a cup of\r\nmilk\xe2\x80\x94that will be a fair bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay; I can find her myself, if she be really in the Mercato; for\r\npretty heads are apt to look forth of doors and windows. No, no.\r\nBesides, a sharp trader, like you, ought to know that he who bids for\r\nnuts and news, may chance to find them hollow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, with a sideway glance of some admiration,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou were not born of a Sunday\xe2\x80\x94the salt-shops were open when you came\r\ninto the world. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a Hebrew, eh?\xe2\x80\x94come from Spain or Naples, eh?\r\nLet me tell you the Frati Minori are trying to make Florence as hot as\r\nSpain for those dogs of hell that want to get all the profit of usury\r\nto themselves and leave none for Christians; and when you walk the\r\nCalimara with a piece of yellow cloth in your cap, it will spoil your\r\nbeauty more than a sword-cut across that smooth olive cheek of\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x94_Abbaratta, baratta_\xe2\x80\x94_chi abbaratta_?\xe2\x80\x94I tell you, young man,\r\ngrey cloth is against yellow cloth; and there\xe2\x80\x99s as much grey cloth in\r\nFlorence as would make a gown and cowl for the Duomo, and there\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nso much yellow cloth as would make hose for Saint Christopher\xe2\x80\x94blessed\r\nbe his name, and send me a sight of him this day!\xe2\x80\x94_Abbaratta, baratta,\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99ratta_\xe2\x80\x94_chi abbaratta_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is very amusing information you are parting with for\r\nnothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, rather scornfully; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it happens not to\r\nconcern me. I am no Hebrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, triumphantly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made a good bargain with\r\nmere words. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made you tell me something, young man, though you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nas hard to hold as a lamprey. San Giovanni be praised! a blind\r\nFlorentine is a match for two one-eyed men. But here we are in the\r\nMercato.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had now emerged from the narrow streets into a broad piazza, known\r\nto the elder Florentine writers as the Mercato Vecchio, or the Old\r\nMarket. This piazza, though it had been the scene of a provision-market\r\nfrom time immemorial, and may, perhaps, says fond imagination, be the\r\nvery spot to which the Fesulean ancestors of the Florentines descended\r\nfrom their high fastness to traffic with the rustic population of the\r\nvalley, had not been shunned as a place of residence by Florentine\r\nwealth. In the early decades of the fifteenth century, which was now\r\nnear its end, the Medici and other powerful families of the _popolani\r\ngrassi_, or commercial nobility, had their houses there, not perhaps\r\nfinding their ears much offended by the loud roar of mingled dialects,\r\nor their eyes much shocked by the butchers\xe2\x80\x99 stalls, which the old poet\r\nAntonio Pucci accounts a chief glory, or _dignita_, of a market that,\r\nin his esteem, eclipsed the markets of all the earth beside. But the\r\nglory of mutton and veal (well attested to be the flesh of the right\r\nanimals; for were not the skins, with the heads attached, duly\r\ndisplayed, according to the decree of the Signoria?) was just now\r\nwanting to the Mercato, the time of Lent not being yet over. The proud\r\ncorporation, or \xe2\x80\x9cArt,\xe2\x80\x9d of butchers was in abeyance, and it was the\r\ngreat harvest-time of the market-gardeners, the cheesemongers, the\r\nvendors of macaroni, corn, eggs, milk, and dried fruits: a change which\r\nwas apt to make the women\xe2\x80\x99s voices predominant in the chorus. But in\r\nall seasons there was the experimental ringing of pots and pans, the\r\nchinking of the money-changers, the tempting offers of cheapness at the\r\nold-clothes stalls, the challenges of the dicers, the vaunting of new\r\nlinens and woollens, of excellent wooden-ware, kettles, and\r\nfrying-pans; there was the choking of the narrow inlets with mules and\r\ncarts, together with much uncomplimentary remonstrance in terms\r\nremarkably identical with the insults in use by the gentler sex of the\r\npresent day, under the same imbrowning and heating circumstances.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, who came to market, looked on at a larger amount\r\nof amateur fighting than could easily be seen in these later times, and\r\nbeheld more revolting rags, beggary, and rascaldom, than modern\r\nhouseholders could well picture to themselves. As the day wore on, the\r\nhideous drama of the gaming-house might be seen here by any chance\r\nopen-air spectator\xe2\x80\x94the quivering eagerness, the blank despair, the\r\nsobs, the blasphemy, and the blows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cE vedesi chi perde con gran soffi,\r\nE bestemmiar colla mano alia mascella,\r\nE ricever e dar di molti ingoffi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut still there was the relief of prettier sights: there were\r\nbrood-rabbits, not less innocent and astonished than those of our own\r\nperiod; there were doves and singing-birds to be bought as presents for\r\nthe children; there were even kittens for sale, and here and there a\r\nhandsome _gattuccio_, or \xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d with the highest character for mousing;\r\nand, better than all, there were young, softly-rounded cheeks and\r\nbright eyes, freshened by the start from the far-off castello (walled\r\nvillage) at daybreak, not to speak of older faces with the unfading\r\ncharm of honest goodwill in them, such as are never quite wanting in\r\nscenes of human industry. And high on a pillar in the centre of the\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94a venerable pillar, fetched from the church of San Giovanni\xe2\x80\x94stood\r\nDonatello\xe2\x80\x99s stone statue of Plenty, with a fountain near it, where,\r\nsays old Pucci, the good wives of the market freshened their utensils,\r\nand their throats also; not because they were unable to buy wine, but\r\nbecause they wished to save the money for their husbands.\r\n\r\nBut on this particular morning a sudden change seemed to have come over\r\nthe face of the market. The _deschi_, or stalls, were indeed partly\r\ndressed with their various commodities, and already there were\r\npurchasers assembled, on the alert to secure the finest, freshest\r\nvegetables and the most unexceptionable butter. But when Bratti and his\r\ncompanion entered the piazza, it appeared that some common\r\npreoccupation had for the moment distracted the attention both of\r\nbuyers and sellers from their proper business. Most of the traders had\r\nturned their backs on their goods, and had joined the knots of talkers\r\nwho were concentrating themselves at different points in the piazza. A\r\nvendor of old-clothes, in the act of hanging out a pair of long hose,\r\nhad distractedly hung them round his neck in his eagerness to join the\r\nnearest group; an oratorical cheesemonger, with a piece of cheese in\r\none hand and a knife in the other, was incautiously making notes of his\r\nemphatic pauses on that excellent specimen of _marzolino_; and elderly\r\nmarket-women, with their egg-baskets in a dangerously oblique position,\r\ncontributed a wailing fugue of invocation.\r\n\r\nIn this general distraction, the Florentine boys, who were never\r\nwanting in any street scene, and were of an especially mischievous\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94as who should say, very sour crabs indeed\xe2\x80\x94saw a great opportunity.\r\nSome made a rush at the nuts and dried figs, others preferred the\r\nfarinaceous delicacies at the cooked provision stalls\xe2\x80\x94delicacies to\r\nwhich certain four-footed dogs also, who had learned to take kindly to\r\nLenten fare, applied a discriminating nostril, and then disappeared\r\nwith much rapidity under the nearest shelter; while the mules, not\r\nwithout some kicking and plunging among impeding baskets, were\r\nstretching their muzzles towards the aromatic green-meat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiavolo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, as he and his companion came, quite unnoticed,\r\nupon the noisy scene; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Mercato is gone as mad as if the most Holy\r\nFather had excommunicated us again. I must know what this is. But never\r\nfear: it seems a thousand years to you till you see the pretty Tessa,\r\nand get your cup of milk; but keep hold of me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold to my\r\nbargain. Remember, I\xe2\x80\x99m to have the first bid for your suit, specially\r\nfor the hose, which, with all their stains, are the best _panno di\r\ngarbo_\xe2\x80\x94as good as ruined, though, with mud and weather stains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOla, Monna Trecca,\xe2\x80\x9d Bratti proceeded, turning towards an old woman on\r\nthe outside of the nearest group, who for the moment had suspended her\r\nwail to listen, and shouting close in her ear: \xe2\x80\x9cHere are the mules\r\nupsetting all your bunches of parsley: is the world coming to an end,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonna Trecca\xe2\x80\x9d (equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cDame Greengrocer\xe2\x80\x9d) turned round at this\r\nunexpected trumpeting in her right ear, with a half-fierce,\r\nhalf-bewildered look, first at the speaker, then at her disarranged\r\ncommodities, and then at the speaker again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad Easter and a bad year to you, and may you die by the sword!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nburst out, rushing towards her stall, but directing this first volley\r\nof her wrath against Bratti, who, without heeding the malediction,\r\nquietly slipped into her place, within hearing of the narrative which\r\nhad been absorbing her attention; making a sign at the same time to the\r\nyounger stranger to keep near him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I saw it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said a fat man, with a bunch of\r\nnewly-purchased leeks in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in Santa Maria Novella, and\r\nsaw it myself. The woman started up and threw out her arms, and cried\r\nout and said she saw a big bull with fiery horns coming down on the\r\nchurch to crush it. I saw it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaw what, Goro?\xe2\x80\x9d said a man of slim figure, whose eye twinkled rather\r\nroguishly. He wore a close jerkin, a skull-cap lodged carelessly over\r\nhis left ear as if it had fallen there by chance, a delicate linen\r\napron tucked up on one side, and a razor stuck in his belt. \xe2\x80\x9cSaw the\r\nbull, or only the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the woman, to be sure; but it\xe2\x80\x99s all one, _mi pare_: it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalter the meaning\xe2\x80\x94_va_!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the fat man, with some contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaning? no, no; that\xe2\x80\x99s clear enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices at once,\r\nand then followed a confusion of tongues, in which \xe2\x80\x9cLights shooting\r\nover San Lorenzo for three nights together\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThunder in the clear\r\nstarlight\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLantern of the Duomo struck with the sword of Saint\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Palle_\xe2\x80\x9d (Arms of the Medici)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAll smashed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLions tearing\r\neach other to pieces\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh! and they might well\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Boto_[1] _caduto in\r\nSantissima Nunziata_!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDied like the best of Christians\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGod will\r\nhave pardoned him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94were often-repeated phrases, which shot across each\r\nother like storm-driven hailstones, each speaker feeling rather the\r\nnecessity of utterance than of finding a listener. Perhaps the only\r\nsilent members of the group were Bratti, who, as a new-comer, was busy\r\nin mentally piecing together the flying fragments of information; the\r\nman of the razor; and a thin-lipped, eager-looking personage in\r\nspectacles, wearing a pen-and-ink case at his belt.\r\n\r\n [1] A votive image of Lorenzo, in wax, hung up in the Church of the\r\n Annunziata, supposed to have fallen at the time of his death. _Boto_\r\n is popular Tuscan for _Voto_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ebbene_, Nello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, skirting the group till he was within\r\nhearing of the barber. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears the Magnifico is dead\xe2\x80\x94rest his\r\nsoul!\xe2\x80\x94and the price of wax will rise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nello; and then added, with an air of extra\r\ngravity, but with marvellous rapidity, \xe2\x80\x9cand his waxen image in the\r\nNunziata fell at the same moment, they say; or at some other time,\r\nwhenever it pleases the Frati Serviti, who know best. And several cows\r\nand women have had still-born calves this Quaresima; and for the bad\r\neggs that have been broken since the Carnival, nobody has counted them.\r\nAh! a great man\xe2\x80\x94a great politician\xe2\x80\x94a greater poet than Dante. And yet\r\nthe cupola didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall, only the lantern. _Che miracolo_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sharp and lengthened \xe2\x80\x9cPst!\xe2\x80\x9d was suddenly heard darting across the\r\npelting storm of gutturals. It came from the pale man in spectacles,\r\nand had the effect he intended; for the noise ceased, and all eyes in\r\nthe group were fixed on him with a look of expectation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well said you Florentines are blind,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in an incisive\r\nhigh voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me, you need nothing but a diet of hay to\r\nmake cattle of you. What! do you think the death of Lorenzo is the\r\nscourge God has prepared for Florence? Go! you are sparrows chattering\r\npraise over the dead hawk. What! a man who was trying to slip a noose\r\nover every neck in the Republic that he might tighten it at his\r\npleasure! You like that; you like to have the election of your\r\nmagistrates turned into closet-work, and no man to use the rights of a\r\ncitizen unless he is a Medicean. That is what is meant by qualification\r\nnow: _netto di specchio_[2] no longer means that a man pays his dues to\r\nthe Republic: it means that he\xe2\x80\x99ll wink at robbery of the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94at robbery of their daughters\xe2\x80\x99 dowries; that he\xe2\x80\x99ll play the\r\nchamberer and the philosopher by turns\xe2\x80\x94listen to bawdy songs at the\r\nCarnival and cry \xe2\x80\x98Bellissimi!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and listen to sacred lauds and cry again\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bellissimi!\xe2\x80\x99 But this is what you love: you grumble and raise a riot\r\nover your _quattrini bianchi_\xe2\x80\x9d (white farthings); \xe2\x80\x9cbut you take no\r\nnotice when the public treasury has got a hole in the bottom for the\r\ngold to run into Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s drains. You like to pay for footmen to walk\r\nbefore and behind one of your citizens, that he may be affable and\r\ncondescending to you. \xe2\x80\x98See, what a tall Pisan we keep,\xe2\x80\x99 say you, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nmarch before him with the drawn sword flashing in our eyes!\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\nLorenzo smiles at us. What goodness!\xe2\x80\x99 And you think the death of a man,\r\nwho would soon have saddled and bridled you as the Sforza has saddled\r\nand bridled Milan\xe2\x80\x94you think his death is the scourge God is warning you\r\nof by portents. I tell you there is another sort of scourge in the\r\nair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [2] The phrase used to express the absence of disqualification\xe2\x80\x94i.e.,\r\n the not being entered as a debtor in the public book\xe2\x80\x94_specchio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, Ser Cioni, keep astride your politics, and never mount your\r\nprophecy; politics is the better horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you talk\r\nof portents, what portent can be greater than a pious notary? Balaam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nass was nothing to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but a notary out of work, with his inkbottle dry,\xe2\x80\x9d said another\r\nbystander, very much out at elbows. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter don a cowl at once, Ser\r\nCioni: everybody will believe in your fasting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notary turned and left the group with a look of indignant contempt,\r\ndisclosing, as he did so, the sallow but mild face of a short man who\r\nhad been standing behind him, and whose bent shoulders told of some\r\nsedentary occupation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy San Giovanni, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fat purchaser of leeks, with the\r\nair of a person rather shaken in his theories, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure there\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t some truth in what Ser Cioni says. For I know I have good reason\r\nto find fault with the _quattrini bianchi_ myself. Grumble, did he say?\r\nSuffocation! I should think we do grumble; and, let anybody say the\r\nword, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn out into the piazza with the readiest, sooner than have\r\nour money altered in our hands as if the magistracy were so many\r\nnecromancers. And it\xe2\x80\x99s true Lorenzo might have hindered such work if he\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94and for the bull with the flaming horns, why, as Ser Cioni says,\r\nthere may be many meanings to it, for the matter of that; it may have\r\nmore to do with the taxes than we think. For when God above sends a\r\nsign, it\xe2\x80\x99s not to be supposed he\xe2\x80\x99d have only one meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoken like an oracle, Goro!\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, when we poor\r\nmortals can pack two or three meanings into one sentence, it were mere\r\nblasphemy not to believe that your miraculous bull means everything\r\nthat any man in Florence likes it to mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art pleased to scoff, Nello,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sallow, round-shouldered\r\nman, no longer eclipsed by the notary, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is not the less true\r\nthat every revelation, whether by visions, dreams, portents, or the\r\nwritten word, has many meanings, which it is given to the illuminated\r\nonly to unfold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I been to hear the Frate in San\r\nLorenzo? But then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to hear Fra Menico in the Duomo too; and\r\naccording to him, your Fra Girolamo, with his visions and\r\ninterpretations, is running after the wind of Mongibello, and those who\r\nfollow him are like to have the fate of certain swine that ran headlong\r\ninto the sea\xe2\x80\x94or some hotter place. With San Domenico roaring _\xc3\xa8 vero_\r\nin one ear, and San Francisco screaming _\xc3\xa8 falso_ in the other, what is\r\na poor barber to do\xe2\x80\x94unless he were illuminated? But it\xe2\x80\x99s plain our Goro\r\nhere is beginning to be illuminated for he already sees that the bull\r\nwith the flaming horns means first himself, and secondly all the other\r\naggrieved taxpayers of Florence, who are determined to gore the\r\nmagistracy on the first opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoro is a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said a bass voice, with a note that dropped like the\r\nsound of a great bell in the midst of much tinkling. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him carry\r\nhome his leeks and shake his flanks over his wool-beating. He\xe2\x80\x99ll mend\r\nmatters more that way than by showing his tun-shaped body in the\r\npiazza, as if everybody might measure his grievances by the size of his\r\npaunch. The burdens that harm him most are his heavy carcass and his\r\nidleness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker had joined the group only in time to hear the conclusion of\r\nNello\xe2\x80\x99s speech, but he was one of those figures for whom all the world\r\ninstinctively makes way, as it would for a battering-ram. He was not\r\nmuch above the middle height, but the impression of enormous force\r\nwhich was conveyed by his capacious chest and brawny arms bared to the\r\nshoulder, was deepened by the keen sense and quiet resolution expressed\r\nin his glance and in every furrow of his cheek and brow. He had often\r\nbeen an unconscious model to Domenico Ghirlandajo, when that great\r\npainter was making the walls of the churches reflect the life of\r\nFlorence, and translating pale aerial traditions into the deep colour\r\nand strong lines of the faces he knew. The naturally dark tint of his\r\nskin was additionally bronzed by the same powdery deposit that gave a\r\npolished black surface to his leathern apron: a deposit which habit had\r\nprobably made a necessary condition of perfect ease, for it was not\r\nwashed off with punctilious regularity.\r\n\r\nGoro turned his fat cheek and glassy eye on the frank speaker with a\r\nlook of deprecation rather than of resentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Niccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an injured tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you sing to\r\nanother tune than that, often enough, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been laying down the\r\nlaw at San Gallo on a festa. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say yourself, that a man\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t a mill-wheel, to be on the grind, grind, as long as he was\r\ndriven, and then stick in his place without stirring when the water was\r\nlow. And you\xe2\x80\x99re as fond of your vote as any man in Florence\xe2\x80\x94ay, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say, if Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be bringing up my speeches again\r\nafter you\xe2\x80\x99ve swallowed them, and handing them about as if they were\r\nnone the worse. I vote and I speak when there\xe2\x80\x99s any use in it: if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s hot metal on the anvil, I lose no time before I strike; but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t spend good hours in tinkling on cold iron, or in standing on the\r\npavement as thou dost, Goro, with snout upward, like a pig under an\r\noak-tree. And as for Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x94dead and gone before his time\xe2\x80\x94he was a man\r\nwho had an eye for curious iron-work; and if anybody says he wanted to\r\nmake himself a tyrant, I say, \xe2\x80\x98_Sia_; I\xe2\x80\x99ll not deny which way the wind\r\nblows when every man can see the weathercock.\xe2\x80\x99 But that only means that\r\nLorenzo was a crested hawk, and there are plenty of hawks without\r\ncrests whose claws and beaks are as good for tearing. Though if there\r\nwas any chance of a real reform, so that Marzocco (the stone Lion,\r\nemblem of the Republic) might shake his mane and roar again, instead of\r\ndipping his head to lick the feet of anybody that will mount and ride\r\nhim, I\xe2\x80\x99d strike a good blow for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that reform is not far off, Niccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sallow, mild-faced\r\nman, seizing his opportunity like a missionary among the too\r\nlight-minded heathens; \xe2\x80\x9cfor a time of tribulation is coming, and the\r\nscourge is at hand. And when the Church is purged of cardinals and\r\nprelates who traffic in her inheritance that their hands may be full to\r\npay the price of blood and to satisfy their own lusts, the State will\r\nbe purged too\xe2\x80\x94and Florence will be purged of men who love to see\r\navarice and lechery under the red hat and the mitre because it gives\r\nthem the screen of a more hellish vice than their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, as Goro\xe2\x80\x99s broad body would be a screen for my narrow person in\r\ncase of missiles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if that excellent screen happened\r\nto fall, I were stifled under it, surely enough. That is no bad image\r\nof thine, Nanni\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s; for I fancy there is no\r\nroom in the small cup of thy understanding for any other liquor than\r\nwhat he pours into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it were well for thee, Nello,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nanni, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou couldst\r\nempty thyself of thy scoffs and thy jests, and take in that liquor too.\r\nThe warning is ringing in the ears of all men: and it\xe2\x80\x99s no new story;\r\nfor the Abbot Joachim prophesied of the coming time three hundred years\r\nago, and now Fra Girolamo has got the message afresh. He has seen it in\r\na vision, even as the prophets of old: he has seen the sword hanging\r\nfrom the sky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and thou wilt see it thyself, Nanni, if thou wilt stare upward\r\nlong enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2; \xe2\x80\x9cfor that pitiable tailor\xe2\x80\x99s work of thine\r\nmakes thy noddle so overhang thy legs, that thy eyeballs can see nought\r\nabove the stitching-board but the roof of thy own skull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe honest tailor bore the jest without bitterness, bent on convincing\r\nhis hearers of his doctrine rather than of his dignity. But Niccol\xc3\xb2\r\ngave him no opportunity for replying; for he turned away to the pursuit\r\nof his market business, probably considering further dialogue as a\r\ntinkling on cold iron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ebbene_\xe2\x80\x9d said the man with the hose round his neck, who had lately\r\nmigrated from another knot of talkers, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are safest who cross\r\nthemselves and jest at nobody. Do you know that the Magnifico sent for\r\nthe Frate at the last, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t die without his blessing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it so\xe2\x80\x94in truth?\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94God will have\r\npardoned him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died like the best of Christians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever took his eyes from the holy crucifix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Frate will have given him his blessing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the hosen, \xe2\x80\x9conly Guccio there met a\r\nfootman going back to Careggi, and he told him the Frate had been sent\r\nfor yesternight, after the Magnifico had confessed and had the holy\r\nsacraments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s likely enough the Frate will tell the people something about it\r\nin his sermon this morning; is it not true, Nanni?\xe2\x80\x9d said Goro. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Nanni had already turned his back on Goro, and the group was\r\nrapidly thinning; some being stirred by the impulse to go and hear \xe2\x80\x9cnew\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x9d from the Frate (\xe2\x80\x9cnew things\xe2\x80\x9d were the nectar of Florentines);\r\nothers by the sense that it was time to attend to their private\r\nbusiness. In this general movement, Bratti got close to the barber, and\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNello, you\xe2\x80\x99ve a ready tongue of your own, and are used to worming\r\nsecrets out of people when you\xe2\x80\x99ve once got them well lathered. I picked\r\nup a stranger this morning as I was coming in from Rovezzano, and I can\r\nspell him out no better than I can the letters on that scarf I bought\r\nfrom the French cavalier. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t my wits are at fault,\xe2\x80\x94I want no man\r\nto help me tell peas from paternosters,\xe2\x80\x94but when you come to foreign\r\nfashions, a fool may happen to know more than a wise man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, thou hast the wisdom of Midas, who could turn rags and rusty nails\r\ninto gold, even as thou dost,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, \xe2\x80\x9cand he had also something\r\nof the ass about him. But where is thy bird of strange plumage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBratti was looking round, with an air of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiavolo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with some vexation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bird\xe2\x80\x99s flown. It\xe2\x80\x99s true he\r\nwas hungry, and I forgot him. But we shall find him in the Mercato,\r\nwithin scent of bread and savours, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us make the round of the Mercato, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t his feathers that puzzle me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bratti, as they\r\npushed their way together. \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t much in the way of cut and\r\ncloth on this side the Holy Sepulchre that can puzzle a Florentine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr frighten him either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, \xe2\x80\x9cafter he has seen an Englander\r\nor a German.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, cordially; \xe2\x80\x9cone may never lose sight of the\r\nCupola and yet know the world, I hope. Besides, this stranger\xe2\x80\x99s clothes\r\nare good Italian merchandise, and the hose he wears were dyed in\r\nOgnissanti before ever they were dyed with salt water, as he says. But\r\nthe riddle about him is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s explanation was interrupted by some jostling as they\r\nreached one of the entrances of the piazza, and before he could resume\r\nit they had caught sight of the enigmatical object they were in search\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nBreakfast for Love.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Bratti had joined the knot of talkers, the young stranger,\r\nhopeless of learning what was the cause of the general agitation, and\r\nnot much caring to know what was probably of little interest to any but\r\nborn Florentines, soon became tired of waiting for Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s escort; and\r\nchose to stroll round the piazza, looking out for some vendor of\r\neatables who might happen to have less than the average curiosity about\r\npublic news. But as if at the suggestion of a sudden thought, he thrust\r\nhis hand into a purse or wallet that hung at his waist, and explored it\r\nagain and again with a look of frustration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot an obolus, by Jupiter!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, in a language which was not\r\nTuscan or even Italian. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had one poor piece left. I must\r\nget my breakfast for love, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not gone many steps farther before it seemed likely that he had\r\nfound a quarter of the market where that medium of exchange might not\r\nbe rejected.\r\n\r\nIn a corner, away from any group of talkers, two mules were standing,\r\nwell adorned with red tassels and collars. One of them carried wooden\r\nmilk-vessels, the other a pair of panniers filled with herbs and\r\nsalads. Resting her elbow on the neck of the mule that carried the\r\nmilk, there leaned a young girl, apparently not more than sixteen, with\r\na red hood surrounding her face, which was all the more baby-like in\r\nits prettiness from the entire concealment of her hair. The poor child,\r\nperhaps, was weary after her labour in the morning twilight in\r\npreparation for her walk to market from some castello three or four\r\nmiles off, for she seemed to have gone to sleep in that half-standing,\r\nhalf-leaning posture. Nevertheless, our stranger had no compunction in\r\nawaking her; but the means he chose were so gentle, that it seemed to\r\nthe damsel in her dream as if a little sprig of thyme had touched her\r\nlips while she was stooping to gather the herbs. The dream was broken,\r\nhowever, for she opened her blue baby-eyes, and started up with\r\nastonishment and confusion to see the young stranger standing close\r\nbefore her. She heard him speaking to her in a voice which seemed so\r\nstrange and soft, that even if she had been more collected she would\r\nhave taken it for granted that he said something hopelessly\r\nunintelligible to her, and her first movement was to turn her head a\r\nlittle away, and lift up a corner of her green serge mantle as a\r\nscreen. He repeated his words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, pretty one, for awaking you. I\xe2\x80\x99m dying with hunger, and\r\nthe scent of milk makes breakfast seem more desirable than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had chosen the words \xe2\x80\x9c_muoio di fame_\xe2\x80\x9d because he knew they would be\r\nfamiliar to her ears; and he had uttered them playfully, with the\r\nintonation of a mendicant. This time he was understood; the corner of\r\nthe mantle was dropped, and in a few moments a large cup of fragrant\r\nmilk was held out to him. He paid no further compliments before raising\r\nit to his lips, and while he was drinking, the little maiden found\r\ncourage to look up at the long dark curls of this singular-voiced\r\nstranger, who had asked for food in the tones of a beggar, but who,\r\nthough his clothes were much damaged, was unlike any beggar she had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nWhile this process of survey was going on, there was another current of\r\nfeeling that carried her hand into a bag which hung by the side of the\r\nmule, and when the stranger set down his cup, he saw a large piece of\r\nbread held out towards him, and caught a glance of the blue eyes that\r\nseemed intended as an encouragement to him to take this additional\r\ngift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps that is your own breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have had\r\nenough without payment. A thousand thanks, my gentle one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no rejoinder in words; but the piece of bread was pushed a\r\nlittle nearer to him, as if in impatience at his refusal; and as the\r\nlong dark eyes of the stranger rested on the baby-face, it seemed to be\r\ngathering more and more courage to look up and meet them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, if I must take the bread,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying his hand on it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall get bolder still, and beg for another kiss to make the bread\r\nsweeter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis speech was getting wonderfully intelligible in spite of the strange\r\nvoice, which had at first almost seemed a thing to make her cross\r\nherself. She blushed deeply, and lifted up a corner of her mantle to\r\nher mouth again. But just as the too presumptuous stranger was leaning\r\nforward, and had his fingers on the arm that held up the screening\r\nmantle, he was startled by a harsh voice close upon his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are _you_\xe2\x80\x94with a murrain to you? No honest buyer, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant,\r\nbut a hanger-on of the dicers\xe2\x80\x94or something worse. Go! dance off, and\r\nfind fitter company, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a tune to a little quicker time\r\nthan you\xe2\x80\x99ll like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young stranger drew back and looked at the speaker with a glance\r\nprovokingly free from alarm and deprecation, and his slight expression\r\nof saucy amusement broke into a broad beaming smile as he surveyed the\r\nfigure of his threatenor. She was a stout but brawny woman, with a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s jerkin slipped over her green serge gamurra or gown, and the\r\npeaked hood of some departed mantle fastened round her sunburnt face,\r\nwhich, under all its coarseness and premature wrinkles, showed a\r\nhalf-sad, half-ludicrous maternal resemblance to the tender baby-face\r\nof the little maiden\xe2\x80\x94the sort of resemblance which often seems a more\r\ncroaking, shudder-creating prophecy than that of the death\xe2\x80\x99s-head.\r\n\r\nThere was something irresistibly propitiating in that bright young\r\nsmile, but Monna Ghita was not a woman to betray any weakness, and she\r\nwent on speaking, apparently with heightened exasperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, you can grin as well as other monkeys in cap and jerkin.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a minstrel or a mountebank, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sworn; you look for all the\r\nworld as silly as a tumbler when he\xe2\x80\x99s been upside down and has got on\r\nhis heels again. And what fool\xe2\x80\x99s tricks hast thou been after, Tessa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, turning to her daughter, whose frightened face was more\r\ninviting to abuse. \xe2\x80\x9cGiving away the milk and victuals, it seems; ay,\r\nay, thou\xe2\x80\x99dst carry water in thy ears for any idle vagabond that didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to stoop for it, thou silly staring rabbit! Turn thy back, and\r\nlift the herbs out of the panniers, else I\xe2\x80\x99ll make thee say a few Aves\r\nwithout counting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, with a pleading smile, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nangry with your pretty Tessa for taking pity on a hungry traveller, who\r\nfound himself unexpectedly without a quattrino. Your handsome face\r\nlooks so well when it frowns, that I long to see it illuminated by a\r\nsmile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Va via_! I know what paste you are made of. You may tickle me with\r\nthat straw a good long while before I shall laugh, I can tell you. Get\r\nalong, with a bad Easter! else I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a beauty-spot or two on that\r\nface of yours that shall spoil your kissing on this side Advent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Monna Ghita lifted her formidable talons by way of complying with\r\nthe first and last requisite of eloquence, Bratti, who had come up a\r\nminute or two before, had been saying to his companion, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat think you\r\nof this pretty parrot, Nello? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t his tongue smack of Venice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Bratti,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber in an undertone, \xe2\x80\x9cthy wisdom has much of\r\nthe ass in it, as I told thee just now; especially about the ears. This\r\nstranger is a Greek, else I\xe2\x80\x99m not the barber who has had the sole and\r\nexclusive shaving of the excellent Demetrio, and drawn more than one\r\nsorry tooth from his learned jaw. And this youth might be taken to have\r\ncome straight from Olympus\xe2\x80\x94at least when he has had a touch of my\r\nrazor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ors\xc3\xb9_! Monna Ghita!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nello, not sorry to see some sport;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat has happened to cause such a thunderstorm? Has this young\r\nstranger been misbehaving himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy San Giovanni!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cautious Bratti, who had not shaken off his\r\noriginal suspicions concerning the shabbily-clad possessor of jewels,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che did right to run away from _me_, if he meant to get into mischief.\r\nI can swear that I found him under the Loggia de\xe2\x80\x99 Cerchi, with a ring\r\non his finger such as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen worn by Bernardo Rucellai himself. Not\r\nanother rusty nail\xe2\x80\x99s worth do I know about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, eyeing the stranger good-humouredly, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\n_bello giovane_ has been a little too presumptuous in admiring the\r\ncharms of Monna Ghita, and has attempted to kiss her while her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s back is turned; for I observe that the pretty Tessa is too\r\nbusy to look this way at present. Was it not so, Messer?\xe2\x80\x9d Nello\r\nconcluded, in a tone of courtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have divined the offence like a soothsayer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger,\r\nlaughingly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly that I had not the good fortune to find Monna Ghita\r\nhere at first. I begged a cup of milk from her daughter, and had\r\naccepted this gift of bread, for which I was making a humble offering\r\nof gratitude, before I had the higher pleasure of being face to face\r\nwith these riper charms which I was perhaps too bold in admiring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Va, va_! be off, every one of you, and stay in purgatory till I pay\r\nto get you out, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Monna Ghita, fiercely, elbowing Nello,\r\nand leading forward her mule so as to compel the stranger to jump\r\naside. \xe2\x80\x9cTessa, thou simpleton, bring forward thy mule a bit: the cart\r\nwill be upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Tessa turned to take the mule\xe2\x80\x99s bridle, she cast one timid glance at\r\nthe stranger, who was now moving with Nello out of the way of an\r\napproaching market-cart; and the glance was just long enough to seize\r\nthe beckoning movement of his hand, which indicated that he had been\r\nwatching for this opportunity of an adieu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ebbene_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, raising his voice to speak across the cart; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nleave you with Nello, young man, for there\xe2\x80\x99s no pushing my bag and\r\nbasket any farther, and I have business at home. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember\r\nour bargain, because if you found Tessa without me, it was not my\r\nfault. Nello will show you my shop in the Ferravecchi, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll not\r\nturn my back on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand thanks, friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, laughing, and then\r\nturned away with Nello up the narrow street which led most directly to\r\nthe Piazza del Duomo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nThe Barber\xe2\x80\x99s Shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young stranger to Nello, as they got\r\na little clearer of the entangled vehicles and mules, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sorry\r\nto be handed over by that patron of mine to one who has a less\r\nbarbarous accent, and a less enigmatical business. Is it a common thing\r\namong you Florentines for an itinerant trafficker in broken glass and\r\nrags to talk of a shop where he sells lutes and swords?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommon? No: our Bratti is not a common man. He has a theory, and lives\r\nup to it, which is more than I can say for any philosopher I have the\r\nhonour of shaving,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nello, whose loquacity, like an over-full\r\nbottle, could never pour forth a small dose. \xe2\x80\x9cBratti means to extract\r\nthe utmost possible amount of pleasure, that is to say, of hard\r\nbargaining, out of this life; winding it up with a bargain for the\r\neasiest possible passage through purgatory, by giving Holy Church his\r\nwinnings when the game is over. He has had his will made to that effect\r\non the cheapest terms a notary could be got for. But I have often said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x98Bratti, thy bargain is a limping one, and thou art on the lame\r\nside of it. Does it not make thee a little sad to look at the pictures\r\nof the Paradiso? Thou wilt never be able there to chaffer for rags and\r\nrusty nails: the saints and angels want neither pins nor tinder; and\r\nexcept with San Bartolommeo, who carries his skin about in an\r\ninconvenient manner, I see no chance of thy making a bargain for\r\nsecond-hand clothing.\xe2\x80\x99 But God pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d added Nello, changing his\r\ntone, and crossing himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthis light talk ill beseems a morning when\r\nLorenzo lies dead, and the Muses are tearing their hair\xe2\x80\x94always a\r\npainful thought to a barber; and you yourself, Messere, are probably\r\nunder a cloud, for when a man of your speech and presence takes up with\r\nso sorry a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, it argues some misfortune to have befallen\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Lorenzo is that whose death you speak of?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger,\r\nappearing to have dwelt with too anxious an interest on this point to\r\nhave noticed the indirect inquiry that followed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Lorenzo? There is but one Lorenzo, I imagine, whose death could\r\nthrow the Mercato into an uproar, set the lantern of the Duomo leaping\r\nin desperation, and cause the lions of the Republic to feel under an\r\nimmediate necessity to devour one another. I mean Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici,\r\nthe Pericles of our Athens\xe2\x80\x94if I may make such a comparison in the ear\r\nof a Greek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, laughingly; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I doubt whether Athens,\r\neven in the days of Pericles, could have produced so learned a barber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; I thought I could not be mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rapid Nello,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9celse I have shaved the venerable Demetrio Calcondila to little\r\npurpose; but pardon me, I am lost in wonder: your Italian is better\r\nthan his, though he has been in Italy forty years\xe2\x80\x94better even than that\r\nof the accomplished Marullo, who may be said to have married the Italic\r\nMuse in more senses than one, since he has married our learned and\r\nlovely Alessandra Scala.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will lighten your wonder to know that I come of a Greek stock\r\nplanted in Italian soil much longer than the mulberry-trees which have\r\ntaken so kindly to it. I was born at Bari, and my\xe2\x80\x94I mean, I was brought\r\nup by an Italian\xe2\x80\x94and, in fact, I am a Greek, very much as your peaches\r\nare Persian. The Greek dye was subdued in me, I suppose, till I had\r\nbeen dipped over again by long abode and much travel in the land of\r\ngods and heroes. And, to confess something of my private affairs to\r\nyou, this same Greek dye, with a few ancient gems I have about me, is\r\nthe only fortune shipwreck has left me. But\xe2\x80\x94when the towers fall, you\r\nknow it is an ill business for the small nest-builders\xe2\x80\x94the death of\r\nyour Pericles makes me wish I had rather turned my steps towards Rome,\r\nas I should have done but for a fallacious Minerva in the shape of an\r\nAugustinian monk. \xe2\x80\x98At Rome,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98you will be lost in a crowd of\r\nhungry scholars; but at Florence, every corner is penetrated by the\r\nsunshine of Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s patronage: Florence is the best market in Italy\r\nfor such commodities as yours.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Gnaff\xc3\xa8_, and so it will remain, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, \xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo was not\r\nthe only patron and judge of learning in our city\xe2\x80\x94heaven forbid!\r\nBecause he was a large melon, every other Florentine is not a pumpkin,\r\nI suppose. Have we not Bernardo Rucellai, and Alamanno Rinuccini, and\r\nplenty more? And if you want to be informed on such matters, I, Nello,\r\nam your man. It seems to me a thousand years till I can be of service\r\nto a _bel erudito_ like yourself. And, first of all, in the matter of\r\nyour hair. That beard, my fine young man, must be parted with, were it\r\nas dear to you as the nymph of your dreams. Here at Florence, we love\r\nnot to see a man with his nose projecting over a cascade of hair. But,\r\nremember, you will have passed the Rubicon, when once you have been\r\nshaven: if you repent, and let your beard grow after it has acquired\r\nstoutness by a struggle with the razor, your mouth will by-and-by show\r\nno longer what Messer Angelo calls the divine prerogative of lips, but\r\nwill appear like a dark cavern fringed with horrent brambles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a terrible prophecy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially if your\r\nFlorentine maidens are many of them as pretty as the little Tessa I\r\nstole a kiss from this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa? she is a rough-handed contadina: you will rise into the favour\r\nof dames who bring no scent of the mule-stables with them. But to that\r\nend, you must not have the air of a _sgherro_, or a man of evil repute:\r\nyou must look like a courtier, and a scholar of the more polished sort,\r\nsuch as our Pietro Crinito\xe2\x80\x94like one who sins among well-bred, well-fed\r\npeople, and not one who sucks down vile _vino di sotto_ in a chance\r\ntavern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the Florentine Graces\r\ndemand it, I am willing to give up this small matter of my beard, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what you would say. It is the\r\n_bella zazzera_\xe2\x80\x94the hyacinthine locks, you do not choose to part with;\r\nand there is no need. Just a little pruning\xe2\x80\x94ecco!\xe2\x80\x94and you will look not\r\nunlike the illustrious prince Pico di Mirandola in his prime. And here\r\nwe are in good time in the Piazza San Giovanni, and at the door of my\r\nshop. But you are pausing, I see: naturally, you want to look at our\r\nwonder of the world, our Duomo, our Santa Maria del Fiore. Well, well,\r\na mere glance; but I beseech you to leave a closer survey till you have\r\nbeen shaved: I am quivering with the inspiration of my art even to the\r\nvery edge of my razor. Ah, then, come round this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mercurial barber seized the arm of the stranger, and led him to a\r\npoint, on the south side of the piazza, from which he could see at once\r\nthe huge dark shell of the cupola, the slender soaring grace of\r\nGiotto\xe2\x80\x99s campanile, and the quaint octagon of San Giovanni in front of\r\nthem, showing its unique gates of storied bronze, which still bore the\r\nsomewhat dimmed glory of their original gilding. The inlaid marbles\r\nwere then fresher in their pink, and white, and purple, than they are\r\nnow, when the winters of four centuries have turned their white to the\r\nrich ochre of well-mellowed meerschaum; the fa\xc3\xa7ade of the cathedral did\r\nnot stand ignominious in faded stucco, but had upon it the magnificent\r\npromise of the half-completed marble inlaying and statued niches, which\r\nGiotto had devised a hundred and fifty years before; and as the\r\ncampanile in all its harmonious variety of colour and form led the eyes\r\nupward, high into the clear air of this April morning, it seemed a\r\nprophetic symbol, telling that human life must somehow and some time\r\nshape itself into accord with that pure aspiring beauty.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the impression it appeared to produce on the Greek.\r\nHis eyes were irresistibly led upward, but as he stood with his arms\r\nfolded and his curls falling backward, there was a slight touch of\r\nscorn on his lip, and when his eyes fell again they glanced round with\r\na scanning coolness which was rather piquing to Nello\xe2\x80\x99s Florentine\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my fine young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with some impatience, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem to\r\nmake as little of our Cathedral as if you were the Angel Gabriel come\r\nstraight from Paradise. I should like to know if you have ever seen\r\nfiner work than our Giotto\xe2\x80\x99s tower, or any cupola that would not look a\r\nmere mushroom by the side of Brunelleschi\xe2\x80\x99s there, or any marbles finer\r\nor more cunningly wrought than these that our Signoria got from far-off\r\nquarries, at a price that would buy a dukedom. Come, now, have you ever\r\nseen anything to equal them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you asked me that question with a scimitar at my throat, after the\r\nTurkish fashion, or even your own razor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Greek, smiling\r\ngaily, and moving on towards the gates of the Baptistery, \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay\r\nyou might get a confession of the true faith from me. But with my\r\nthroat free from peril, I venture to tell you that your buildings smack\r\ntoo much of Christian barbarism for my taste. I have a shuddering sense\r\nof what there is inside\xe2\x80\x94hideous smoked Madonnas; fleshless saints in\r\nmosaic, staring down idiotic astonishment and rebuke from the apse;\r\nskin-clad skeletons hanging on crosses, or stuck all over with arrows,\r\nor stretched on gridirons; women and monks with heads aside in\r\nperpetual lamentation. I have seen enough of those wry-necked\r\nfavourites of heaven at Constantinople. But what is this bronze door\r\nrough with imagery? These women\xe2\x80\x99s figures seem moulded in a different\r\nspirit from those starved and staring saints I spoke of: these heads in\r\nhigh relief speak of a human mind within them, instead of looking like\r\nan index to perpetual spasms and colic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, with some triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we shall show you\r\nby-and-by that our Florentine art is not in a state of barbarism. These\r\ngates, my fine young man, were moulded half a century ago, by our\r\nLorenzo Ghiberti, when he counted hardly so many years as you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, turning away, like one whose\r\nappetite for contemplation was soon satisfied. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard that your\r\nTuscan sculptors and painters have been studying the antique a little.\r\nBut with monks for models, and the legends of mad hermits and martyrs\r\nfor subjects, the vision of Olympus itself would be of small use to\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, with a significant shrug, as they walked\r\nalong. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are of the same mind as Michele Marullo, ay, and as Angelo\r\nPoliziano himself, in spite of his canonicate, when he relaxes himself\r\na little in my shop after his lectures, and talks of the gods awaking\r\nfrom their long sleep and making the woods and streams vital once more.\r\nBut he rails against the Roman scholars who want to make us all talk\r\nLatin again: \xe2\x80\x98My ears,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98are sufficiently flayed by the\r\nbarbarisms of the learned, and if the vulgar are to talk Latin I would\r\nas soon have been in Florence the day they took to beating all the\r\nkettles in the city because the bells were not enough to stay the wrath\r\nof the saints.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah, Messer Greco, if you want to know the flavour of\r\nour scholarship, you must frequent my shop: it is the focus of\r\nFlorentine intellect, and in that sense the navel of the earth\xe2\x80\x94as my\r\ngreat predecessor, Burchiello, said of _his_ shop, on the more\r\nfrivolous pretension that his street of the Calimara was the centre of\r\nour city. And here we are at the sign of \xe2\x80\x98Apollo and the Razor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nApollo, you see, is bestowing the razor on the Triptolemus of our\r\ncraft, the first reaper of beards, the sublime _Anonimo_, whose\r\nmysterious identity is indicated by a shadowy hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see thou hast had custom already, Sandro,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nello,\r\naddressing a solemn-looking dark-eyed youth, who made way for them on\r\nthe threshold. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now make all clear for this signor to sit down. And\r\nprepare the finest-scented lather, for he has a learned and a handsome\r\nchin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a pleasant little adytum there, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger,\r\nlooking through a latticed screen which divided the shop from a room of\r\nabout equal size, opening into a still smaller walled enclosure, where\r\na few bays and laurels surrounded a stone Hermes. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose your\r\nconclave of _eruditi_ meets there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, and not less in my shop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, leading the way into the\r\ninner room, in which were some benches, a table, with one book in\r\nmanuscript and one printed in capitals lying open upon it, a lute, a\r\nfew oil-sketches, and a model or two of hands and ancient masks. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nmy shop is a no less fitting haunt of the Muses, as you will\r\nacknowledge when you feel the sudden illumination of understanding and\r\nthe serene vigour of inspiration that will come to you with a clear\r\nchin. Ah! you can make that lute discourse, I perceive. I, too, have\r\nsome skill that way, though the serenata is useless when daylight\r\ndiscloses a visage like mine, looking no fresher than an apple that has\r\nstood the winter. But look at that sketch: it is a fancy of Piero di\r\nCosimo\xe2\x80\x99s, a strange freakish painter, who says he saw it by long\r\nlooking at a mouldy wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sketch Nello pointed to represented three masks\xe2\x80\x94one a drunken\r\nlaughing Satyr, another a sorrowing Magdalen, and the third, which lay\r\nbetween them, the rigid, cold face of a Stoic: the masks rested\r\nobliquely on the lap of a little child, whose cherub features rose\r\nabove them with something of the supernal promise in the gaze which\r\npainters had by that time learned to give to the Divine Infant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA symbolical picture, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Greek, touching the lute\r\nwhile he spoke, so as to bring out a slight musical murmur. \xe2\x80\x9cThe child,\r\nperhaps, is the Golden Age, wanting neither worship nor philosophy. And\r\nthe Golden Age can always come back as long as men are born in the form\r\nof babies, and don\xe2\x80\x99t come into the world in cassock or furred mantle.\r\nOr, the child may mean the wise philosophy of Epicurus, removed alike\r\nfrom the gross, the sad, and the severe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! everybody has his own interpretation for that picture,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNello; \xe2\x80\x9cand if you ask Piero himself what he meant by it, he says his\r\npictures are an appendix which Messer Domeneddio has been pleased to\r\nmake to the universe, and if any man is in doubt what they mean, he had\r\nbetter inquire of Holy Church. He has been asked to paint a picture\r\nafter the sketch, but he puts his fingers to his ears and shakes his\r\nhead at that; the fancy is past, he says\xe2\x80\x94a strange animal, our Piero.\r\nBut now all is ready for your initiation into the mysteries of the\r\nrazor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMysteries they may well be called,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the barber, with rising\r\nspirits at the prospect of a long monologue, as he imprisoned the young\r\nGreek in the shroud-like shaving-cloth; \xe2\x80\x9cmysteries of Minerva and the\r\nGraces. I get the flower of men\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, because I seize them in the\r\nfirst moment after shaving. (Ah! you wince a little at the lather: it\r\ntickles the outlying limits of the nose, I admit.) And that is what\r\nmakes the peculiar fitness of a barber\xe2\x80\x99s shop to become a resort of wit\r\nand learning. For, look now at a druggist\xe2\x80\x99s shop: there is a dull\r\nconclave at the sign of \xe2\x80\x98The Moor,\xe2\x80\x99 that pretends to rival mine; but\r\nwhat sort of inspiration, I beseech you, can be got from the scent of\r\nnauseous vegetable decoctions?\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of the fact that you no\r\nsooner pass the threshold than you see a doctor of physic, like a\r\ngigantic spider disguised in fur and scarlet, waiting for his prey; or\r\neven see him blocking up the doorway seated on a bony hack, inspecting\r\nsaliva. (Your chin a little elevated, if it please you: contemplate\r\nthat angel who is blowing the trumpet at you from the ceiling. I had it\r\npainted expressly for the regulation of my clients\xe2\x80\x99 chins.) Besides,\r\nyour druggist, who herborises and decocts, is a man of prejudices: he\r\nhas poisoned people according to a system, and is obliged to stand up\r\nfor his system to justify the consequences. Now a barber can be\r\ndispassionate; the only thing he necessarily stands by is the razor,\r\nalways providing he is not an author. That was the flaw in my great\r\npredecessor Burchiello: he was a poet, and had consequently a prejudice\r\nabout his own poetry. I have escaped that; I saw very early that\r\nauthorship is a narrowing business, in conflict with the liberal art of\r\nthe razor, which demands an impartial affection for all men\xe2\x80\x99s chins.\r\nEcco, Messer! the outline of your chin and lip is as clear as a\r\nmaiden\xe2\x80\x99s; and now fix your mind on a knotty question\xe2\x80\x94ask yourself\r\nwhether you are bound to spell Virgil with an _i_ or an _e_, and say if\r\nyou do not feel an unwonted clearness on the point. Only, if you decide\r\nfor the _i_, keep it to yourself till your fortune is made, for the _e_\r\nhath the stronger following in Florence. Ah! I think I see a gleam of\r\nstill quicker wit in your eye. I have it on the authority of our young\r\nNiccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli, himself keen enough to discern _il pelo nell\xe2\x80\x99\r\nuovo_, as we say, and a great lover of delicate shaving, though his\r\nbeard is hardly of two years\xe2\x80\x99 date, that no sooner do the hairs begin\r\nto push themselves, than he perceives a certain grossness of\r\napprehension creeping over him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you let me look at myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nhappy effect on my intellect is perhaps obstructed by a little doubt as\r\nto the effect on my appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold yourself in this mirror, then; it is a Venetian mirror from\r\nMurano, the true _nosce teipsum_, as I have named it, compared with\r\nwhich the finest mirror of steel or silver is mere darkness. See now,\r\nhow by diligent shaving, the nether region of your face may preserve\r\nits human outline, instead of presenting no distinction from the\r\nphysiognomy of a bearded owl or a Barbary ape. I have seen men whose\r\nbeards have so invaded their cheeks, that one might have pitied them as\r\nthe victims of a sad, brutalising chastisement befitting our Dante\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nInferno, if they had not seemed to strut with a strange triumph in\r\ntheir extravagant hairiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek, still looking into the mirror, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou have taken away some of my capital with your razor\xe2\x80\x94I mean a year or\r\ntwo of age, which might have won me more ready credit for my learning.\r\nUnder the inspection of a patron whose vision has grown somewhat dim, I\r\nshall have a perilous resemblance to a maiden of eighteen in the\r\ndisguise of hose and jerkin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, proceeding to clip the too extravagant curls;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour proportions are not those of a maiden. And for your age, I myself\r\nremember seeing Angelo Poliziano begin his lectures on the Latin\r\nlanguage when he had a younger beard than yours; and between ourselves,\r\nhis juvenile ugliness was not less signal than his precocious\r\nscholarship. Whereas you\xe2\x80\x94no, no, your age is not against you; but\r\nbetween ourselves, let me hint to you that your being a Greek, though\r\nit be only an Apulian Greek, is not in your favour. Certain of our\r\nscholars hold that your Greek learning is but a wayside degenerate\r\nplant until it has been transplanted into Italian brains, and that now\r\nthere is such a plentiful crop of the superior quality, your native\r\nteachers are mere propagators of degeneracy. Ecco! your curls are now\r\nof the right proportion to neck and shoulders; rise, Messer, and I will\r\nfree you from the encumbrance of this cloth. _Gnaff\xc3\xa8_! I almost advise\r\nyou to retain the faded jerkin and hose a little longer; they give you\r\nthe air of a fallen prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the question is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Greek, leaning against the high\r\nback of a chair, and returning Nello\xe2\x80\x99s contemplative admiration with a\r\nlook of inquiring anxiety; \xe2\x80\x9cthe question is, in what quarter I am to\r\ncarry my princely air, so as to rise from the said fallen condition. If\r\nyour Florentine patrons of learning share this scholarly hostility to\r\nthe Greeks, I see not how your city can be a hospitable refuge for me,\r\nas you seemed to say just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pian piano_\xe2\x80\x94not so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, sticking his thumbs into his\r\nbelt and nodding to Sandro to restore order. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not conceal from\r\nyou that there is a prejudice against Greeks among us; and though, as a\r\nbarber unsnared by authorship, I share no prejudices, I must admit that\r\nthe Greeks are not always such pretty youngsters as yourself: their\r\nerudition is often of an uncombed, unmannerly aspect, and encrusted\r\nwith a barbarous utterance of Italian, that makes their converse hardly\r\nmore euphonious than that of a Tedesco in a state of vinous loquacity.\r\nAnd then, again, excuse me\xe2\x80\x94we Florentines have liberal ideas about\r\nspeech, and consider that an instrument which can flatter and promise\r\nso cleverly as the tongue, must have been partly made for those\r\npurposes; and that truth is a riddle for eyes and wit to discover,\r\nwhich it were a mere spoiling of sport for the tongue to betray. Still\r\nwe have our limits beyond which we call dissimulation treachery. But it\r\nis said of the Greeks that their honesty begins at what is the hanging\r\npoint with us, and that since the old Furies went to sleep, your\r\nChristian Greek is of so easy a conscience that he would make a\r\nstepping-stone of his father\xe2\x80\x99s corpse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flush on the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face indicated what seemed so natural a\r\nmovement of resentment, that the good-natured Nello hastened to atone\r\nfor his want of reticence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not offended, _bel giovane_; I am but repeating what I hear in my\r\nshop; as you may perceive, my eloquence is simply the cream which I\r\nskim off my clients\xe2\x80\x99 talk. Heaven forbid I should fetter my\r\nimpartiality by entertaining an opinion. And for that same scholarly\r\nobjection to the Greeks,\xe2\x80\x9d added Nello, in a more mocking tone, and with\r\na significant grimace, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact is, you are heretics, Messer; jealousy\r\nhas nothing to do with it: if you would just change your opinion about\r\nleaven, and alter your Doxology a little, our Italian scholars would\r\nthink it a thousand years till they could give up their chairs to you.\r\nYes, yes; it is chiefly religious scruple, and partly also the\r\nauthority of a great classic,\xe2\x80\x94Juvenal, is it not? He, I gather, had his\r\nbile as much stirred by the swarm of Greeks as our Messer Angelo, who\r\nis fond of quoting some passage about their incorrigible\r\nimpudence\xe2\x80\x94_audacia perdita_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! the passage is a compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek, who had recovered\r\nhimself, and seemed wise enough to take the matter gaily\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermo\r\nPromptus, et Isaeo torrentior.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rapid intellect and ready eloquence may carry off a little\r\nimpudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd since, as I see, you know Latin\r\nliterature as well as Greek, you will not fall into the mistake of\r\nGiovanni Argiropulo, who ran full tilt against Cicero, and pronounced\r\nhim all but a pumpkin-head. For, let me give you one bit of advice,\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x94trust a barber who has shaved the best chins, and kept his\r\neyes and ears open for twenty years\xe2\x80\x94oil your tongue well when you talk\r\nof the ancient Latin writers, and give it an extra dip when you talk of\r\nthe modern. A wise Greek may win favour among us; witness our excellent\r\nDemetrio, who is loved by many, and not hated immoderately even by the\r\nmost renowned scholars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI discern the wisdom of your advice so clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek, with\r\nthe bright smile which was continually lighting up the fine form and\r\ncolour of his young face, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I will ask you for a little more. Who\r\nnow, for example, would be the most likely patron for me? Is there a\r\nson of Lorenzo who inherits his tastes? Or is there any other wealthy\r\nFlorentine specially addicted to purchasing antique gems? I have a fine\r\nCleopatra cut in sardonyx, and one or two other intaglios and cameos,\r\nboth curious and beautiful, worthy of being added to the cabinet of a\r\nprince. Happily, I had taken the precaution of fastening them within\r\nthe lining of my doublet before I set out on my voyage. Moreover, I\r\nshould like to raise a small sum for my present need on this ring of\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x9d (here he took out the ring and replaced it on his finger), \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou could recommend me to any honest trafficker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see, let us see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, perusing the floor, and walking\r\nup and down the length of his shop. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is no time to apply to Piero\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, though he has the will to make such purchases if he could\r\nalways spare the money; but I think it is another sort of Cleopatra\r\nthat he covets most... Yes, yes, I have it. What you want is a man of\r\nwealth, and influence, and scholarly tastes\xe2\x80\x94not one of your learned\r\nporcupines, bristling all over with critical tests, but one whose Greek\r\nand Latin are of a comfortable laxity. And that man is Bartolommeo\r\nScala, the secretary of our Republic. He came to Florence as a poor\r\nadventurer himself\xe2\x80\x94a miller\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x98branny monster,\xe2\x80\x99 as he has been\r\nnicknamed by our honey-lipped Poliziano, who agrees with him as well as\r\nmy teeth agree with lemon-juice. And, by the by, that may be a reason\r\nwhy the secretary may be the more ready to do a good turn to a strange\r\nscholar. For, between you and me, _bel giovane_\xe2\x80\x94trust a barber who has\r\nshaved the best scholars\xe2\x80\x94friendliness is much such a steed as Ser\r\nBenghi\xe2\x80\x99s: it will hardly show much alacrity unless it has got the\r\nthistle of hatred under its tail. However, the secretary is a man\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll keep his word to you, even to the halving of a fennel-seed; and\r\nhe is not unlikely to buy some of your gems.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how am I to get at this great man?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek, rather\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cJust now everybody of any public\r\nimportance will be full of Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s death, and a stranger may find it\r\ndifficult to get any notice. But in the meantime, I could take you to a\r\nman who, if he has a mind, can help you to a chance of a favourable\r\ninterview with Scala sooner than anybody else in Florence\xe2\x80\x94worth seeing\r\nfor his own sake too, to say nothing of his collections, or of his\r\ndaughter Romola, who is as fair as the Florentine lily before it got\r\nquarrelsome and turned red.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if this father of the beautiful Romola makes collections, why\r\nshould he not like to buy some of my gems himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNello shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cFor two good reasons\xe2\x80\x94want of sight to\r\nlook at the gems, and want of money to pay for them. Our old Bardo de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBardi is so blind that he can see no more of his daughter than, as he\r\nsays, a glimmering of something bright when she comes very near him:\r\ndoubtless her golden hair, which, as Messer Luigi Pulci says of his\r\nMeridiana\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x98_raggia come stella per sereno_.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah! here come some\r\nclients of mine, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if one of them could serve your\r\nturn about that ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nFirst Impressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, Messer Domenico,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello to the foremost of the two\r\nvisitors who entered the shop, while he nodded silently to the other.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come as opportunely as cheese on macaroni. Ah! you are in\r\nhaste\xe2\x80\x94wish to be shaved without delay\xe2\x80\x94ecco! And this is a morning when\r\nevery one has grave matter on his mind. Florence orphaned\xe2\x80\x94the very\r\npivot of Italy snatched away\xe2\x80\x94heaven itself at a loss what to do next.\r\n_Oim\xc3\xa8_! Well, well; the sun is nevertheless travelling on towards\r\ndinner-time again; and, as I was saying, you come like cheese ready\r\ngrated. For this young stranger was wishing for an honourable trader\r\nwho would advance him a sum on a certain ring of value, and if I had\r\ncounted every goldsmith and money-lender in Florence on my fingers, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have found a better name than Menico Cennini. Besides, he hath\r\nother ware in which you deal\xe2\x80\x94Greek learning, and young eyes\xe2\x80\x94a double\r\nimplement which you printers are always in need of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grave elderly man, son of that Bernardo Cennini, who, twenty years\r\nbefore, having heard of the new process of printing carried on by\r\nGermans, had cast his own types in Florence, remained necessarily in\r\nlathered silence and passivity while Nello showered this talk in his\r\nears, but turned a slow sideway gaze on the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fine young man has unlimited Greek, Latin, or Italian at your\r\nservice,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nello, fond of interpreting by very ample\r\nparaphrase. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is as great a wonder of juvenile learning as Francesco\r\nFilelfo or our own incomparable Poliziano. A second Guarino, too, for\r\nhe has had the misfortune to be shipwrecked, and has doubtless lost a\r\nstore of precious manuscripts that might have contributed some\r\ncorrectness even to your correct editions, Domenico. Fortunately, he\r\nhas rescued a few gems of rare value. His name is\xe2\x80\x94you said your name,\r\nMesser, was\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito Melema,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, slipping the ring from his finger,\r\nand presenting it to Cennini, whom Nello, not less rapid with his razor\r\nthan with his tongue, had now released from the shaving-cloth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the man who had entered the shop in company with the\r\ngoldsmith\xe2\x80\x94a tall figure, about fifty, with a short trimmed beard,\r\nwearing an old felt hat and a threadbare mantle\xe2\x80\x94had kept his eye fixed\r\non the Greek, and now said abruptly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, I am painting a picture of Sinon deceiving old Priam, and I\r\nshould be glad of your face for my Sinon, if you\xe2\x80\x99d give me a sitting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito Melema started and looked round with a pale astonishment in his\r\nface as if at a sudden accusation; but Nello left him no time to feel\r\nat a loss for an answer: \xe2\x80\x9cPiero,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art the most\r\nextraordinary compound of humours and fancies ever packed into a human\r\nskin. What trick wilt thou play with the fine visage of this young\r\nscholar to make it suit thy traitor? Ask him rather to turn his eyes\r\nupward, and thou mayst make a Saint Sebastian of him that will draw\r\ntroops of devout women; or, if thou art in a classical vein, put myrtle\r\nabout his curls and make him a young Bacchus, or say rather a Phoebus\r\nApollo, for his face is as warm and bright as a summer morning; it made\r\nme his friend in the space of a \xe2\x80\x98credo.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Nello,\xe2\x80\x9d said the painter, speaking with abrupt pauses; \xe2\x80\x9cand if thy\r\ntongue can leave off its everlasting chirping long enough for thy\r\nunderstanding to consider the matter, thou mayst see that thou hast\r\njust shown the reason why the face of Messere will suit my traitor. A\r\nperfect traitor should have a face which vice can write no marks\r\non\xe2\x80\x94lips that will lie with a dimpled smile\xe2\x80\x94eyes of such agate-like\r\nbrightness and depth that no infamy can dull them\xe2\x80\x94cheeks that will rise\r\nfrom a murder and not look haggard. I say not this young man is a\r\ntraitor: I mean, he has a face that would make him the more perfect\r\ntraitor if he had the heart of one, which is saying neither more nor\r\nless than that he has a beautiful face, informed with rich young blood,\r\nthat will be nourished enough by food, and keep its colour without much\r\nhelp of virtue. He may have the heart of a hero along with it; I aver\r\nnothing to the contrary. Ask Domenico there if the lapidaries can\r\nalways tell a gem by the sight alone. And now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put the tow\r\nin my ears, for thy chatter and the bells together are more than I can\r\nendure: so say no more to me, but trim my beard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these last words Piero (called \xe2\x80\x9cdi Cosimo,\xe2\x80\x9d from his master,\r\nCosimo Rosselli) drew out two bits of tow, stuffed them in his ears,\r\nand placed himself in the chair before Nello, who shrugged his\r\nshoulders and cast a grimacing look of intelligence at the Greek, as\r\nmuch as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cA whimsical fellow, you perceive! Everybody holds his\r\nspeeches as mere jokes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, who had stood transfixed, with his long dark eyes resting on the\r\nunknown man who had addressed him so equivocally, seemed recalled to\r\nhis self-command by Piero\xe2\x80\x99s change of position, and apparently\r\nsatisfied with his explanation, was again giving his attention to\r\nCennini, who presently said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a curious and valuable ring, young man. This intaglio of the\r\nfish with the crested serpent above it, in the black stratum of the\r\nonyx, or rather nicolo, is well shown by the surrounding blue of the\r\nupper stratum. The ring has, doubtless, a history?\xe2\x80\x9d added Cennini,\r\nlooking up keenly at the young stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, meeting the scrutiny very frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ring\r\nwas found in Sicily, and I have understood from those who busy\r\nthemselves with gems and sigils, that both the stone and intaglio are\r\nof virtue to make the wearer fortunate, especially at sea, and also to\r\nrestore to him whatever he may have lost. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, smiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough I have worn it constantly since I quitted Greece, it has not\r\nmade me altogether fortunate at sea, you perceive, unless I am to count\r\nescape from drowning as a sufficient proof of its virtue. It remains to\r\nbe seen whether my lost chests will come to light; but to lose no\r\nchance of such a result, Messer, I will pray you only to hold the ring\r\nfor a short space as pledge for a small sum far beneath its value, and\r\nI will redeem it as soon as I can dispose of certain other gems which\r\nare secured within my doublet, or indeed as soon as I can earn\r\nsomething by any scholarly employment, if I may be so fortunate as to\r\nmeet with such.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be seen, young man, if you will come with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother Pietro, who is a better judge of scholarship than I, will\r\nperhaps be able to supply you with a task that may test your\r\ncapabilities. Meanwhile, take back your ring until I can hand you the\r\nnecessary florins, and, if it please you, come along with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, \xe2\x80\x9cgo with Messer Domenico, you cannot go in\r\nbetter company; he was born under the constellation that gives a man\r\nskill, riches, and integrity, whatever that constellation may be, which\r\nis of the less consequence because babies can\xe2\x80\x99t choose their own\r\nhoroscopes, and, indeed, if they could, there might be an inconvenient\r\nrush of babies at particular epochs. Besides, our Phoenix, the\r\nincomparable Pico, has shown that your horoscopes are all a nonsensical\r\ndream\xe2\x80\x94which is the less troublesome opinion. _Addio! bel giovane_!\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to come back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, beckoning a farewell, as he turned round\r\nhis bright face at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to do me a great service:\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nthe most positive security for your seeing me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what thou wilt, Piero,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, as the young stranger\r\ndisappeared, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never look at such an outside as that without\r\ntaking it as a sign of a lovable nature. Why, thou wilt say next that\r\nLeonardo, whom thou art always raving about, ought to have made his\r\nJudas as beautiful as Saint John! But thou art as deaf as the top of\r\nMount Morello with that accursed tow in thy ears. Well, well: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\na little more of this young man\xe2\x80\x99s history from him before I take him to\r\nBardo Bardi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nThe Blind Scholar and his Daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, a street noted in the history of Florence, lies in\r\nOltrarno, or that portion of the city which clothes the southern bank\r\nof the river. It extends from the Ponte Vecchio to the Piazza de\xe2\x80\x99 Mozzi\r\nat the head of the Ponte alle Grazie; its right-hand line of houses and\r\nwalls being backed by the rather steep ascent which in the fifteenth\r\ncentury was known as the hill of Bogoli, the famous stone-quarry whence\r\nthe city got its pavement\xe2\x80\x94of dangerously unstable consistence when\r\npenetrated by rains; its left-hand buildings flanking the river and\r\nmaking on their northern side a length of quaint, irregularly-pierced\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade, of which the waters give a softened loving reflection as the\r\nsun begins to decline towards the western heights. But quaint as these\r\nbuildings are, some of them seem to the historical memory a too modern\r\nsubstitute for the famous houses of the Bardi family, destroyed by\r\npopular rage in the middle of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThey were a proud and energetic stock, these Bardi; conspicuous among\r\nthose who clutched the sword in the earliest world-famous quarrels of\r\nFlorentines with Florentines, when the narrow streets were darkened\r\nwith the high towers of the nobles, and when the old tutelar god Mars,\r\nas he saw the gutters reddened with neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 blood, might well have\r\nsmiled at the centuries of lip-service paid to his rival, the Baptist.\r\nBut the Bardi hands were of the sort that not only clutch the\r\nsword-hilt with vigour, but love the more delicate pleasure of\r\nfingering minted metal: they were matched, too, with true Florentine\r\neyes, capable of discerning that power was to be won by other means\r\nthan by rending and riving, and by the middle of the fourteenth century\r\nwe find them risen from their original condition of _popolani_ to be\r\npossessors, by purchase, of lands and strongholds, and the feudal\r\ndignity of Counts of Vernio, disturbing to the jealousy of their\r\nrepublican fellow-citizens. These lordly purchases are explained by our\r\nseeing the Bardi disastrously signalised only a few years later as\r\nstanding in the very front of European commerce\xe2\x80\x94the Christian\r\nRothschilds of that time\xe2\x80\x94undertaking to furnish specie for the wars of\r\nour Edward the Third, and having revenues \xe2\x80\x9cin kind\xe2\x80\x9d made over to them;\r\nespecially in wool, most precious of freights for Florentine galleys.\r\nTheir august debtor left them with an august deficit, and alarmed\r\nSicilian creditors made a too sudden demand for the payment of\r\ndeposits, causing a ruinous shock to the credit of the Bardi and of\r\nassociated houses, which was felt as a commercial calamity along all\r\nthe coasts of the Mediterranean. But, like more modern bankrupts, they\r\ndid not, for all that, hide their heads in humiliation; on the\r\ncontrary, they seemed to have held them higher than ever, and to have\r\nbeen among the most arrogant of those grandees, who under certain\r\nnoteworthy circumstances, open to all who will read the honest pages of\r\nGiovanni Villani, drew upon themselves the exasperation of the armed\r\npeople in 1343. The Bardi, who had made themselves fast in their street\r\nbetween the two bridges, kept these narrow inlets, like panthers at\r\nbay, against the oncoming gonfalons of the people, and were only made\r\nto give way by an assault from the hill behind them. Their houses by\r\nthe river, to the number of twenty-two (_palagi e case grandi_), were\r\nsacked and burnt, and many among the chief of those who bore the Bardi\r\nname were driven from the city. But an old Florentine family was\r\nmany-rooted, and we find the Bardi maintaining importance and rising\r\nagain and again to the surface of Florentine affairs in a more or less\r\ncreditable manner, implying an untold family history that would have\r\nincluded even more vicissitudes and contrasts of dignity and disgrace,\r\nof wealth and poverty, than are usually seen on the background of wide\r\nkinship.[1] But the Bardi never resumed their proprietorship in the old\r\nstreet on the banks of the river, which in 1492 had long been\r\nassociated with other names of mark, and especially with the Neri, who\r\npossessed a considerable range of houses on the side towards the hill.\r\n\r\n [1] A sign that such contrasts were peculiarly frequent in Florence,\r\n is the fact that Saint Antonine, Prior of San Marco, and afterwards\r\n archbishop, in the first half of this fifteenth century, founded the\r\n society of Buonuomini di San Martino (Good Men of Saint Martin) with\r\n the main object of succouring the _poveri vergognosi_\xe2\x80\x94in other words,\r\n paupers of good family. In the records of the famous Panciatichi\r\n family we find a certain Girolamo in this century who was reduced to\r\n such a state of poverty that he was obliged to seek charity for the\r\n mere means of sustaining life, though other members of his family were\r\n enormously wealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of these Neri houses there lived, however, a descendant of the\r\nBardi, and of that very branch which a century and a half before had\r\nbecome Counts of Vernio: a descendant who had inherited the old family\r\npride and energy, the old love of pre-eminence, the old desire to leave\r\na lasting track of his footsteps on the fast-whirling earth. But the\r\nfamily passions lived on in him under altered conditions: this\r\ndescendant of the Bardi was not a man swift in street warfare, or one\r\nwho loved to play the signor, fortifying strongholds and asserting the\r\nright to hang vassals, or a merchant and usurer of keen daring, who\r\ndelighted in the generalship of wide commercial schemes: he was a man\r\nwith a deep-veined hand cramped by much copying of manuscripts, who ate\r\nsparing dinners, and wore threadbare clothes, at first from choice and\r\nat last from necessity; who sat among his books and his marble\r\nfragments of the past, and saw them only by the light of those far-off\r\nyounger days which still shone in his memory: he was a moneyless, blind\r\nold scholar\xe2\x80\x94the Bardo de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi to whom Nello, the barber, had promised\r\nto introduce the young Greek, Tito Melema.\r\n\r\nThe house in which Bardo lived was situated on the side of the street\r\nnearest the hill, and was one of those large sombre masses of stone\r\nbuilding pierced by comparatively small windows, and surmounted by what\r\nmay be called a roofed terrace or loggia, of which there are many\r\nexamples still to be seen in the venerable city. Grim doors, with\r\nconspicuous scrolled hinges, having high up on each side of them a\r\nsmall window defended by iron bars, opened on a groined entrance-court,\r\nempty of everything but a massive lamp-iron suspended from the centre\r\nof the groin. A smaller grim door on the left-hand admitted to the\r\nstone staircase, and the rooms on the ground-floor. These last were\r\nused as a warehouse by the proprietor; so was the first floor; and both\r\nwere filled with precious stores, destined to be carried, some perhaps\r\nto the banks of the Scheldt, some to the shores of Africa, some to the\r\nisles of the Aegean, or to the banks of the Euxine. Maso, the old\r\nserving-man, when he returned from the Mercato with the stock of cheap\r\nvegetables, had to make his slow way up to the second storey before he\r\nreached the door of his master, Bardo, through which we are about to\r\nenter only a few mornings after Nello\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with the Greek.\r\n\r\nWe follow Maso across the ante-chamber to the door on the left-hand,\r\nthrough which we pass as he opens it. He merely looks in and nods,\r\nwhile a clear young voice says, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are come back, Maso. It is\r\nwell. We have wanted nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice came from the farther end of a long, spacious room,\r\nsurrounded with shelves, on which books and antiquities were arranged\r\nin scrupulous order. Here and there, on separate stands in front of the\r\nshelves, were placed a beautiful feminine torso; a headless statue,\r\nwith an uplifted muscular arm wielding a bladeless sword; rounded,\r\ndimpled, infantine limbs severed from the trunk, inviting the lips to\r\nkiss the cold marble; some well-preserved Roman busts; and two or three\r\nvases from Magna Grecia. A large table in the centre was covered with\r\nantique bronze lamps and small vessels in dark pottery. The colour of\r\nthese objects was chiefly pale or sombre: the vellum bindings, with\r\ntheir deep-ridged backs, gave little relief to the marble, livid with\r\nlong burial; the once splendid patch of carpet at the farther end of\r\nthe room had long been worn to dimness; the dark bronzes wanted\r\nsunlight upon them to bring out their tinge of green, and the sun was\r\nnot yet high enough to send gleams of brightness through the narrow\r\nwindows that looked on the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi.\r\n\r\nThe only spot of bright colour in the room was made by the hair of a\r\ntall maiden of seventeen or eighteen, who was standing before a carved\r\n_leggio_, or reading-desk, such as is often seen in the choirs of\r\nItalian churches. The hair was of a reddish gold colour, enriched by an\r\nunbroken small ripple, such as may be seen in the sunset clouds on\r\ngrandest autumnal evenings. It was confined by a black fillet above her\r\nsmall ears, from which it rippled forward again, and made a natural\r\nveil for her neck above her square-cut gown of black _rascia_, or\r\nserge. Her eyes were bent on a large volume placed before her: one long\r\nwhite hand rested on the reading-desk, and the other clasped the back\r\nof her father\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\nThe blind father sat with head uplifted and turned a little aside\r\ntowards his daughter, as if he were looking at her. His delicate\r\npaleness, set off by the black velvet cap which surmounted his drooping\r\nwhite hair, made all the more perceptible the likeness between his aged\r\nfeatures and those of the young maiden, whose cheeks were also without\r\nany tinge of the rose. There was the same refinement of brow and\r\nnostril in both, counterbalanced by a full though firm mouth and\r\npowerful chin, which gave an expression of proud tenacity and latent\r\nimpetuousness: an expression carried out in the backward poise of the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s head, and the grand line of her neck and shoulders. It was a\r\ntype of face of which one could not venture to say whether it would\r\ninspire love or only that unwilling admiration which is mixed with\r\ndread: the question must be decided by the eyes, which often seem\r\ncharged with a more direct message from the soul. But the eyes of the\r\nfather had long been silent, and the eyes of the daughter were bent on\r\nthe Latin pages of Politian\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Miscellanea,\xe2\x80\x99 from which she was reading\r\naloud at the eightieth chapter, to the following effect:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a certain nymph of Thebes named Chariclo, especially dear to\r\nPallas; and this nymph was the mother of Teiresias. But once when in\r\nthe heat of summer, Pallas, in company with Chariclo, was bathing her\r\ndisrobed limbs in the Heliconian Hippocrene, it happened that Teiresias\r\ncoming as a hunter to quench his thirst at the same fountain,\r\ninadvertently beheld Minerva unveiled, and immediately became blind.\r\nFor it is declared in the Saturnian laws, that he who beholds the gods\r\nagainst their will, shall atone for it by a heavy penalty... When\r\nTeiresias had fallen into this calamity, Pallas, moved by the tears of\r\nChariclo, endowed him with prophecy and length of days, and even caused\r\nhis prudence and wisdom to continue after he had entered among the\r\nshades, so that an oracle spake from his tomb: and she gave him a\r\nstaff, wherewith, as by a guide, he might walk without stumbling... And\r\nhence, Nonnus, in the fifth book of the \xe2\x80\x98Dionysiaca,\xe2\x80\x99 introduces\r\nActreon exclaiming that he calls Teiresias happy, since, without dying,\r\nand with the loss of his eyesight merely, he had beheld Minerva\r\nunveiled, and thus, though blind, could for evermore carry her image in\r\nhis soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point in the reading, the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand slipped from the back\r\nof the chair and met her father\xe2\x80\x99s, which he had that moment uplifted;\r\nbut she had not looked round, and was going on, though with a voice a\r\nlittle altered by some suppressed feeling, to read the Greek quotation\r\nfrom Nonnus, when the old man said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, Romola; reach me my own copy of Nonnus. It is a more correct\r\ncopy than any in Poliziano\xe2\x80\x99s hands, for I made emendations in it which\r\nhave not yet been communicated to any man. I finished it in 1477, when\r\nmy sight was fast failing me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola walked to the farther end of the room, with the queenly step\r\nwhich was the simple action of her tall, finely-wrought frame, without\r\nthe slightest conscious adjustment of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it in the right place, Romola?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bardo, who was perpetually\r\nseeking the assurance that the outward fact continued to correspond\r\nwith the image which lived to the minutest detail in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father; at the west end of the room, on the third shelf from the\r\nbottom, behind the bust of Hadrian, above Apollonius Rhodius and\r\nCallimachus, and below Lucan and Silius Italicus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Romola said this, a fine ear would have detected in her clear voice\r\nand distinct utterance, a faint suggestion of weariness struggling with\r\nhabitual patience. But as she approached her father and saw his arms\r\nstretched out a little with nervous excitement to seize the volume, her\r\nhazel eyes filled with pity; she hastened to lay the book on his lap,\r\nand kneeled down by him, looking up at him as if she believed that the\r\nlove in her face must surely make its way through the dark obstruction\r\nthat shut out everything else. At that moment the doubtful\r\nattractiveness of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face, in which pride and passion seemed to\r\nbe quivering in the balance with native refinement and intelligence,\r\nwas transfigured to the most lovable womanliness by mingled pity and\r\naffection: it was evident that the deepest fount of feeling within her\r\nhad not yet wrought its way to the less changeful features, and only\r\nfound its outlet through her eyes.\r\n\r\nBut the father, unconscious of that soft radiance, looked flushed and\r\nagitated as his hand explored the edges and back of the large book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vellum is yellowed in these thirteen years, Romola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, gently; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your letters at the back are\r\ndark and plain still\xe2\x80\x94fine Roman letters; and the Greek character,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, laying the book open on her father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, \xe2\x80\x9cis more\r\nbeautiful than that of any of your bought manuscripts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, passing his finger across the page, as\r\nif he hoped to discriminate line and margin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat hired amanuensis can\r\nbe equal to the scribe who loves the words that grow under his hand,\r\nand to whom an error or indistinctness in the text is more painful than\r\na sudden darkness or obstacle across his path? And even these\r\nmechanical printers who threaten to make learning a base and vulgar\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94even they must depend on the manuscript over which we scholars\r\nhave bent with that insight into the poet\xe2\x80\x99s meaning which is closely\r\nakin to the _mens divinior_ of the poet himself; unless they would\r\nflood the world with grammatical falsities and inexplicable anomalies\r\nthat would turn the very fountain of Parnassus into a deluge of\r\npoisonous mud. But find the passage in the fifth book, to which\r\nPoliziano refers\xe2\x80\x94I know it very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeating herself on a low stool, close to her father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, Romola took\r\nthe book on her lap and read the four verses containing the exclamation\r\nof Actreon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, when she had finished; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a true\r\nconception of the poet; for what is that grosser, narrower light by\r\nwhich men behold merely the petty scene around them, compared with that\r\nfar-stretching, lasting light which spreads over centuries of thought,\r\nand over the life of nations, and makes clear to us the minds of the\r\nimmortals who have reaped the great harvest and left us to glean in\r\ntheir furrows? For me, Romola, even when I could see, it was with the\r\ngreat dead that I lived; while the living often seemed to me mere\r\nspectres\xe2\x80\x94shadows dispossessed of true feeling and intelligence; and\r\nunlike those Lamiae, to whom Poliziano, with that superficial ingenuity\r\nwhich I do not deny to him, compares our inquisitive Florentines,\r\nbecause they put on their eyes when they went abroad, and took them off\r\nwhen they got home again, I have returned from the converse of the\r\nstreets as from a forgotten dream, and have sat down among my books,\r\nsaying with Petrarca, the modern who is least unworthy to be named\r\nafter the ancients, \xe2\x80\x98Libri medullitus delectant, colloquuntur,\r\nconsulunt, et viva quadam nobis atque arguta familiaritate junguntur.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in one thing you are happier than your favourite Petrarca,\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, affectionately humouring the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisposition to dilate in this way; \xe2\x80\x9cfor he used to look at his copy of\r\nHomer and think sadly that the Greek was a dead letter to him: so far,\r\nhe had the inward blindness that you feel is worse than your outward\r\nblindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, child; for I carry within me the fruits of that fervid study\r\nwhich I gave to the Greek tongue under the teaching of the younger\r\nCrisolora, and Filelfo, and Argiropulo; though that great work in which\r\nI had desired to gather, as into a firm web, all the threads that my\r\nresearch had laboriously disentangled, and which would have been the\r\nvintage of my life, was cut off by the failure of my sight and my want\r\nof a fitting coadjutor. For the sustained zeal and unconquerable\r\npatience demanded from those who would tread the unbeaten paths of\r\nknowledge are still less reconcilable with the wandering, vagrant\r\npropensity of the feminine mind than with the feeble powers of the\r\nfeminine body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, with a sudden flush and in an injured tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nread anything you wish me to read; and I will look out any passages for\r\nyou, and make whatever notes you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo shook his head, and smiled with a bitter sort of pity. \xe2\x80\x9cAs well\r\ntry to be a pentathlos and perform all the five feats of the palaestra\r\nwith the limbs of a nymph. Have I forgotten thy fainting in the mere\r\nsearch for the references I needed to explain a single passage of\r\nCallimachus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, father, it was the weight of the books, and Maso can help me; it\r\nwas not want of attention and patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo shook his head again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not mere bodily organs that I want:\r\nit is the sharp edge of a young mind to pierce the way for my somewhat\r\nblunted faculties. For blindness acts like a dam, sending the streams\r\nof thought backward along the already-travelled channels and hindering\r\nthe course onward. If my son had not forsaken me, deluded by debasing\r\nfanatical dreams, worthy only of an energumen whose dwelling is among\r\ntombs, I might have gone on and seen my path broadening to the end of\r\nmy life; for he was a youth of great promise. But it has closed in\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man continued, after a short pause; \xe2\x80\x9cit has closed in\r\nnow;\xe2\x80\x94all but the narrow track he has left me to tread\xe2\x80\x94alone in my\r\nblindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola started from her seat, and carried away the large volume to its\r\nplace again, stung too acutely by her father\xe2\x80\x99s last words to remain\r\nmotionless as well as silent; and when she turned away from the shelf\r\nagain, she remained standing at some distance from him, stretching her\r\narms downwards and clasping her fingers tightly as she looked with a\r\nsad dreariness in her young face at the lifeless objects around her\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nparchment backs, the unchanging mutilated marble, the bits of obsolete\r\nbronze and clay.\r\n\r\nBardo, though usually susceptible to Romola\xe2\x80\x99s movements and eager to\r\ntrace them, was now too entirely preoccupied by the pain of rankling\r\nmemories to notice her departure from his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwith my son to aid me, I might have had my due\r\nshare in the triumphs of this century: the names of the Bardi, father\r\nand son, might have been held reverently on the lips of scholars in the\r\nages to come; not on account of frivolous verses or philosophical\r\ntreatises, which are superfluous and presumptuous attempts to imitate\r\nthe inimitable, such as allure vain men like Panhormita, and from which\r\neven the admirable Poggio did not keep himself sufficiently free; but\r\nbecause we should have given a lamp whereby men might have studied the\r\nsupreme productions of the past. For why is a young man like Poliziano\r\n(who was not yet born when I was already held worthy to maintain a\r\ndiscussion with Thomas of Sarzana) to have a glorious memory as a\r\ncommentator on the Pandects\xe2\x80\x94why is Ficino, whose Latin is an offence to\r\nme, and who wanders purblind among the superstitious fancies that\r\nmarked the decline at once of art, literature, and philosophy, to\r\ndescend to posterity as the very high priest of Platonism, while I, who\r\nam more than their equal, have not effected anything but scattered\r\nwork, which will be appropriated by other men? Why? but because my son,\r\nwhom I had brought up to replenish my ripe learning with young\r\nenterprise, left me and all liberal pursuits that he might lash himself\r\nand howl at midnight with besotted friars\xe2\x80\x94that he might go wandering on\r\npilgrimages befitting men who know of no past older than the missal and\r\nthe crucifix?\xe2\x80\x94left me when the night was already beginning to fall on\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn these last words the old man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, which had risen high in\r\nindignant protest, fell into a tone of reproach so tremulous and\r\nplaintive that Romola, turning her eyes again towards the blind aged\r\nface, felt her heart swell with forgiving pity. She seated herself by\r\nher father again, and placed her hand on his knee\xe2\x80\x94too proud to obtrude\r\nconsolation in words that might seem like a vindication of her own\r\nvalue, yet wishing to comfort him by some sign of her presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, automatically letting his left-hand, with\r\nits massive prophylactic rings, fall a little too heavily on the\r\ndelicate blue-veined back of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s right, so that she bit her lip\r\nto prevent herself from starting. \xe2\x80\x9cIf even Florence only is to remember\r\nme, it can but be on the same ground that it will remember Niccol\xc3\xb2\r\nNiccoli\xe2\x80\x94because I forsook the vulgar pursuit of wealth in commerce that\r\nI might devote myself to collecting the precious remains of ancient art\r\nand wisdom, and leave them, after the example of the munificent Romans,\r\nfor an everlasting possession to my fellow-citizens. But why do I say\r\nFlorence only? If Florence remembers me, will not the world remember\r\nme? ... Yet,\xe2\x80\x9d added Bardo, after a short pause, his voice falling again\r\ninto a saddened key, \xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death has raised a new\r\ndifficulty. I had his promise\xe2\x80\x94I should have had his bond\xe2\x80\x94that my\r\ncollection should always bear my name and should never be sold, though\r\nthe harpies might clutch everything else; but there is enough for\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94there is more than enough\xe2\x80\x94and for thee, too, Romola, there will be\r\nenough. Besides, thou wilt marry; Bernardo reproaches me that I do not\r\nseek a fitting _parentado_ for thee, and we will delay no longer, we\r\nwill think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, father; what could you do? besides, it is useless: wait till\r\nsome one seeks me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my child, that is not the paternal duty. It was not so held by\r\nthe ancients, and in this respect Florentines have not degenerated from\r\ntheir ancestral customs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will study diligently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, her eyes dilating with\r\nanxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cI will become as learned as Cassandra Fedele: I will try and\r\nbe as useful to you as if I had been a boy, and then perhaps some great\r\nscholar will want to marry me, and will not mind about a dowry; and he\r\nwill like to come and live with you, and he will be to you in place of\r\nmy brother... and you will not be sorry that I was a daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a rising sob in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s voice as she said the last words,\r\nwhich touched the fatherly fibre in Bardo. He stretched his hand upward\r\na little in search of her golden hair, and as she placed her head under\r\nhis hand, he gently stroked it, leaning towards her as if his eyes\r\ndiscerned some glimmer there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Romola mia, I said not so; if I have pronounced an anathema on a\r\ndegenerate and ungrateful son, I said not that I could wish thee other\r\nthan the sweet daughter thou hast been to me. For what son could have\r\ntended me so gently in the frequent sickness I have had of late? And\r\neven in learning thou art not, according to thy measure, contemptible.\r\nSomething perhaps were to be wished in thy capacity of attention and\r\nmemory, not incompatible even with the feminine mind. But as Calcondila\r\nbore testimony, when he aided me to teach thee, thou hast a ready\r\napprehension, and even a wide-glancing intelligence. And thou hast a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s nobility of soul: thou hast never fretted me with thy petty\r\ndesires as thy mother did. It is true, I have been careful to keep thee\r\naloof from the debasing influence of thy own sex, with their\r\nsparrow-like frivolity and their enslaving superstition, except,\r\nindeed, from that of our cousin Brigida, who may well serve as a\r\nscarecrow and a warning. And though\xe2\x80\x94since I agree with the divine\r\nPetrarca, when he declares, quoting the \xe2\x80\x98Aulularia\xe2\x80\x99 of Plautus, who\r\nagain was indebted for the truth to the supreme Greek intellect,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Optimam foeminam nullam esse, alia licet alia pejor sit\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I cannot\r\nboast that thou art entirely lifted out of that lower category to which\r\nNature assigned thee, nor even that in erudition thou art on a par with\r\nthe more learned women of this age; thou art, nevertheless\xe2\x80\x94yes, Romola\r\nmia,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, his pedantry again melting into tenderness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthou art my sweet daughter, and thy voice is as the lower notes of the\r\nflute, \xe2\x80\x98dulcis, durabilis, clara, pura, secans a\xc3\xabra et auribus sedens,\xe2\x80\x99\r\naccording to the choice words of Quintilian; and Bernardo tells me thou\r\nart fair, and thy hair is like the brightness of the morning, and\r\nindeed it seems to me that I discern some radiance from thee. Ah! I\r\nknow how all else looks in this room, but thy form I only guess at.\r\nThou art no longer the little woman six years old, that faded for me\r\ninto darkness; thou art tall, and thy arm is but little below mine. Let\r\nus walk together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man rose, and Romola, soothed by these beams of tenderness,\r\nlooked happy again as she drew his arm within hers, and placed in his\r\nright-hand the stick which rested at the side of his chair. While Bardo\r\nhad been sitting, he had seemed hardly more than sixty: his face,\r\nthough pale, had that refined texture in which wrinkles and lines are\r\nnever deep; but now that he began to walk he looked as old as he really\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94rather more than seventy; for his tall spare frame had the\r\nstudent\xe2\x80\x99s stoop of the shoulders, and he stepped with the undecided\r\ngait of the blind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pausing against the bust of Hadrian, and passing\r\nhis stick from the right to the left that he might explore the familiar\r\noutline with a \xe2\x80\x9cseeing hand.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be nothing else to preserve\r\nmy memory and carry down my name as a member of the great republic of\r\nletters\xe2\x80\x94nothing but my library and my collection of antiquities. And\r\nthey are choice,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bardo, pressing the bust and speaking in a\r\ntone of insistence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe collections of Niccol\xc3\xb2 I know were larger; but\r\ntake any collection which is the work of a single man\xe2\x80\x94that of the great\r\nBoccaccio even\xe2\x80\x94mine will surpass it. That of Poggio was contemptible\r\ncompared with mine. It will be a great gift to unborn scholars. And\r\nthere is nothing else. For even if I were to yield to the wish of Aldo\r\nManuzio when he sets up his press at Venice, and give him the aid of my\r\nannotated manuscripts, I know well what would be the result: some other\r\nscholar\xe2\x80\x99s name would stand on the title-page of the edition\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nscholar who would have fed on my honey, and then declared in his\r\npreface that he had gathered it all himself fresh from Hymettus. Else,\r\nwhy have I refused the loan of many an annotated codex? why have I\r\nrefused to make public any of my translations? why? but because\r\nscholarship is a system of licenced robbery, and your man in scarlet\r\nand furred robe who sits in judgment on thieves, is himself a thief of\r\nthe thoughts and the fame that belong to his fellows. But against that\r\nrobbery Bardo de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi shall struggle\xe2\x80\x94though blind and forsaken, he\r\nshall struggle. I too have a right to be remembered\xe2\x80\x94as great a right as\r\nPontanus or Merula, whose names will be foremost on the lips of\r\nposterity, because they sought patronage and found it; because they had\r\ntongues that could flatter, and blood that was used to be nourished\r\nfrom the client\xe2\x80\x99s basket. I have a right to be remembered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s voice had become at once loud and tremulous, and a pink\r\nflush overspread his proud, delicately-cut features, while the\r\nhabitually raised attitude of his head gave the idea that behind the\r\ncurtain of his blindness he saw some imaginary high tribunal to which\r\nhe was appealing against the injustice of Fame.\r\n\r\nRomola was moved with sympathetic indignation, for in her nature too\r\nthere lay the same large claims, and the same spirit of struggle\r\nagainst their denial. She tried to calm her father by a still prouder\r\nword than his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, father, it is a great gift of the gods to be born with a\r\nhatred and contempt of all injustice and meanness. Yours is a higher\r\nlot, never to have lied and truckled, than to have shared honours won\r\nby dishonour. There is strength in scorn, as there was in the martial\r\nfury by which men became insensible to wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well said, Romola. It is a Promethean word thou hast uttered,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Bardo, after a little interval in which he had begun to lean\r\non his stick again, and to walk on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I indeed am not to be pierced\r\nby the shafts of Fortune. My armour is the _aes triplex_ of a clear\r\nconscience, and a mind nourished by the precepts of philosophy. \xe2\x80\x98For\r\nmen,\xe2\x80\x99 says Epictetus, \xe2\x80\x98are disturbed not by things themselves, but by\r\ntheir opinions or thoughts concerning those things.\xe2\x80\x99 And again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98whosoever will be free, let him not desire or dread that which it is\r\nin the power of others either to deny or inflict: otherwise, he is a\r\nslave.\xe2\x80\x99 And of all such gifts as are dependent on the caprice of\r\nfortune or of men, I have long ago learned to say, with Horace\xe2\x80\x94who,\r\nhowever, is too wavering in his philosophy, vacillating between the\r\nprecepts of Zeno and the less worthy maxims of Epicurus, and\r\nattempting, as we say, \xe2\x80\x98duabus sellis sedere\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94concerning such\r\naccidents, I say, with the pregnant brevity of the poet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is referring to gems, and purple, and other insignia of wealth; but\r\nI may apply his words not less justly to the tributes men pay us with\r\ntheir lips and their pens, which are also matters of purchase, and\r\noften with base coin. Yes, \xe2\x80\x98_inanis_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94hollow, empty\xe2\x80\x94is the epithet\r\njustly bestowed on Fame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey made the tour of the room in silence after this; but Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlip-born maxims were as powerless over the passion which had been\r\nmoving him, as if they had been written on parchment and hung round his\r\nneck in a sealed bag; and he presently broke forth again in a new tone\r\nof insistence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Inanis_? yes, if it is a lying fame; but not if it is the just meed\r\nof labour and a great purpose. I claim my right: it is not fair that\r\nthe work of my brain and my hands should not be a monument to me\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nnot just that my labour should bear the name of another man. It is but\r\nlittle to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man went on, bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my name should be\r\nover the door\xe2\x80\x94that men should own themselves debtors to the Bardi\r\nLibrary in Florence. They will speak coldly of me, perhaps: \xe2\x80\x98a diligent\r\ncollector and transcriber,\xe2\x80\x99 they will say, \xe2\x80\x98and also of some critical\r\ningenuity, but one who could hardly be conspicuous in an age so\r\nfruitful in illustrious scholars. Yet he merits our pity, for in the\r\nlatter years of his life he was blind, and his only son, to whose\r\neducation he had devoted his best years\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 Nevertheless, my name will be\r\nremembered, and men will honour me: not with the breath of flattery,\r\npurchased by mean bribes, but because I have laboured, and because my\r\nlabours will remain. Debts! I know there are debts; and there is thy\r\ndowry, Romola, to be paid. But there must be enough\xe2\x80\x94or, at least, there\r\ncan lack but a small sum, such as the Signoria might well provide. And\r\nif Lorenzo had not died, all would have been secured and settled. But\r\nnow...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Maso opened the door, and advancing to his master,\r\nannounced that Nello, the barber, had desired him to say, that he was\r\ncome with the Greek scholar whom he had asked leave to introduce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cBring them in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo, conscious that he looked more dependent when he was walking,\r\nliked always to be seated in the presence of strangers, and Romola,\r\nwithout needing to be told, conducted him to his chair. She was\r\nstanding by him at her full height, in quiet majestic self-possession,\r\nwhen the visitors entered; and the most penetrating observer would\r\nhardly have divined that this proud pale face, at the slightest touch\r\non the fibres of affection or pity, could become passionate with\r\ntenderness, or that this woman, who imposed a certain awe on those who\r\napproached her, was in a state of girlish simplicity and ignorance\r\nconcerning the world outside her father\xe2\x80\x99s books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nDawning Hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Maso opened the door again, and ushered in the two visitors,\r\nNello, first making a deep reverence to Romola, gently pushed Tito\r\nbefore him, and advanced with him towards her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMesser Bardo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a more measured and respectful tone than\r\nwas usual with him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have the honour of presenting to you the Greek\r\nscholar, who has been eager to have speech of you, not less from the\r\nreport I have made to him of your learning and your priceless\r\ncollections, than because of the furtherance your patronage may give\r\nhim under the transient need to which he has been reduced by shipwreck.\r\nHis name is Tito Melema, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment could hardly have been greater if the stranger\r\nhad worn a panther-skin and carried a thyrsus; for the cunning barber\r\nhad said nothing of the Greek\xe2\x80\x99s age or appearance; and among her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s scholarly visitors, she had hardly ever seen any but\r\nmiddle-aged or grey-headed men. There was only one masculine face, at\r\nonce youthful and beautiful, the image of which remained deeply\r\nimpressed on her mind: it was that of her brother, who long years ago\r\nhad taken her on his knee, kissed her, and never come back again: a\r\nfair face, with sunny hair, like her own. But the habitual attitude of\r\nher mind towards strangers\xe2\x80\x94a proud self-dependence and determination to\r\nask for nothing even by a smile\xe2\x80\x94confirmed in her by her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplaints against the world\xe2\x80\x99s injustice, was like a snowy embankment\r\nhemming in the rush of admiring surprise. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s bright face showed its\r\nrich-tinted beauty without any rivalry of colour above his black _sajo_\r\nor tunic reaching to the knees. It seemed like a wreath of spring,\r\ndropped suddenly in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s young but wintry life, which had inherited\r\nnothing but memories\xe2\x80\x94memories of a dead mother, of a lost brother, of a\r\nblind father\xe2\x80\x99s happier time\xe2\x80\x94memories of far-off light, love, and\r\nbeauty, that lay embedded in dark mines of books, and could hardly give\r\nout their brightness again until they were kindled for her by the torch\r\nof some known joy. Nevertheless, she returned Tito\xe2\x80\x99s bow, made to her\r\non entering, with the same pale proud face as ever; but, as he\r\napproached, the snow melted, and when he ventured to look towards her\r\nagain, while Nello was speaking, a pink flush overspread her face, to\r\nvanish again almost immediately, as if her imperious will had recalled\r\nit. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s glance, on the contrary, had that gentle, beseeching\r\nadmiration in it which is the most propitiating of appeals to a proud,\r\nshy woman, and is perhaps the only atonement a man can make for being\r\ntoo handsome. The finished fascination of his air came chiefly from the\r\nabsence of demand and assumption. It was that of a fleet, soft-coated,\r\ndark-eyed animal that delights you by not bounding away in indifference\r\nfrom you, and unexpectedly pillows its chin on your palm, and looks up\r\nat you desiring to be stroked\xe2\x80\x94as if it loved you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessere, I give you welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, with some condescension;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmisfortune wedded to learning, and especially to Greek learning, is a\r\nletter of credit that should win the ear of every instructed\r\nFlorentine; for, as you are doubtless aware, since the period when your\r\ncountryman, Manuelo Crisolora, diffused the light of his teaching in\r\nthe chief cities of Italy, now nearly a century ago, no man is held\r\nworthy of the name of scholar who has acquired merely the transplanted\r\nand derivative literature of the Latins; rather, such inert students\r\nare stigmatised as _opici_ or barbarians according to the phrase of the\r\nRomans themselves, who frankly replenished their urns at the\r\nfountain-head. I am, as you perceive, and as Nello has doubtless\r\nforewarned you, totally blind: a calamity to which we Florentines are\r\nheld especially liable, whether owing to the cold winds which rush upon\r\nus in spring from the passes of the Apennines, or to that sudden\r\ntransition from the cool gloom of our houses to the dazzling brightness\r\nof our summer sun, by which the _lippi_ are said to have been made so\r\nnumerous among the ancient Romans; or, in fine, to some occult cause\r\nwhich eludes our superficial surmises. But I pray you be seated: Nello,\r\nmy friend, be seated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo paused until his fine ear had assured him that the visitors were\r\nseating themselves, and that Romola was taking her usual chair at his\r\nright-hand. Then he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what part of Greece do you come, Messere? I had thought that your\r\nunhappy country had been almost exhausted of those sons who could\r\ncherish in their minds any image of her original glory, though indeed\r\nthe barbarous Sultans have of late shown themselves not indisposed to\r\nengraft on their wild stock the precious vine which their own fierce\r\nbands have hewn down and trampled under foot. From what part of Greece\r\ndo you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sailed last from Nauplia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have resided both at\r\nConstantinople and Thessalonica, and have travelled in various parts\r\nlittle visited by Western Christians since the triumph of the Turkish\r\narms. I should tell you, however, Messere, that I was not born in\r\nGreece, but at Bari. I spent the first sixteen years of my life in\r\nSouthern Italy and Sicily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Tito was speaking, some emotion passed, like a breath on the\r\nwaters, across Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s delicate features; he leaned forward, put out\r\nhis right-hand towards Romola, and turned his head as if about to speak\r\nto her; but then, correcting himself, turned away again, and said, in a\r\nsubdued voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me; is it not true\xe2\x80\x94you are young?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am three-and-twenty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, still in a tone of subdued excitement, \xe2\x80\x9cand you had,\r\ndoubtless, a father who cared for your early instruction\xe2\x80\x94who, perhaps,\r\nwas himself a scholar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause before Tito\xe2\x80\x99s answer came to the ear of Bardo;\r\nbut for Romola and Nello it began with a slight shock that seemed to\r\npass through him, and cause a momentary quivering of the lip; doubtless\r\nat the revival of a supremely painful remembrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cat least a father by adoption. He was a Neapolitan,\r\nand of accomplished scholarship, both Latin and Greek. But,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nTito, after another slight pause, \xe2\x80\x9che is lost to me\xe2\x80\x94was lost on a\r\nvoyage he too rashly undertook to Delos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo sank backward again, too delicate to ask another question that\r\nmight probe a sorrow which he divined to be recent. Romola, who knew\r\nwell what were the fibres that Tito\xe2\x80\x99s voice had stirred in her father,\r\nfelt that this new acquaintance had with wonderful suddenness got\r\nwithin the barrier that lay between them and the alien world. Nello,\r\nthinking that the evident check given to the conversation offered a\r\ngraceful opportunity for relieving himself from silence, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, it is as clear as Venetian glass that this fine young man\r\nhas had the best training; for the two Cennini have set him to work at\r\ntheir Greek sheets already, and it seems to me they are not men to\r\nbegin cutting before they have felt the edge of their tools; they\r\ntested him well beforehand, we may be sure, and if there are two things\r\nnot to be hidden\xe2\x80\x94love and a cough\xe2\x80\x94I say there is a third, and that is\r\nignorance, when once a man is obliged to do something besides wagging\r\nhis head. The _tonsor inequalis_ is inevitably betrayed when he takes\r\nthe shears in his hand; is it not true, Messer Bardo? I speak after the\r\nfashion of a barber, but, as Luigi Pulci says\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Perdonimi s\xe2\x80\x99io fallo: chi m\xe2\x80\x99ascolta\r\nIntenda il mio volgar col suo latino.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my good Nello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, with an air of friendly severity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are not altogether illiterate, and might doubtless have made a\r\nmore respectable progress in learning if you had abstained somewhat\r\nfrom the _cicalata_ and gossip of the street-corner, to which our\r\nFlorentines are excessively addicted; but still more if you had not\r\nclogged your memory with those frivolous productions of which Luigi\r\nPulci has furnished the most peccant exemplar\xe2\x80\x94a compendium of\r\nextravagances and incongruities the farthest removed from the models of\r\na pure age, and resembling rather the _grylli_ or conceits of a period\r\nwhen mystic meaning was held a warrant for monstrosity of form; with\r\nthis difference, that while the monstrosity is retained, the mystic\r\nmeaning is absent; in contemptible contrast with the great poem of\r\nVirgil, who, as I long held with Filelfo, before Landino had taken upon\r\nhim to expound the same opinion, embodied the deepest lessons of\r\nphilosophy in a graceful and well-knit fable. And I cannot but regard\r\nthe multiplication of these babbling, lawless productions, albeit\r\ncountenanced by the patronage, and in some degree the example of\r\nLorenzo himself, otherwise a friend to true learning, as a sign that\r\nthe glorious hopes of this century are to be quenched in gloom; nay,\r\nthat they have been the delusive prologue to an age worse than that of\r\niron\xe2\x80\x94the age of tinsel and gossamer, in which no thought has substance\r\nenough to be moulded into consistent and lasting form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more, pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, opening his palms outwards, and\r\nshrugging his shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cI find myself knowing so many things in good\r\nTuscan before I have time to think of the Latin for them; and Messer\r\nLuigi\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes are always slipping off the lips of my customers:\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis what corrupts me. And, indeed, talking of customers, I have left my\r\nshop and my reputation too long in the custody of my slow Sandro, who\r\ndoes not deserve even to be called a _tonsor inequalis_, but rather to\r\nbe pronounced simply a bungler in the vulgar tongue. So with your\r\npermission, Messer Bardo, I will take my leave\xe2\x80\x94well understood that I\r\nam at your service whenever Maso calls upon me. It seems a thousand\r\nyears till I dress and perfume the damigella\xe2\x80\x99s hair, which deserves to\r\nshine in the heavens as a constellation, though indeed it were a pity\r\nfor it ever to go so far out of reach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree voices made a fugue of friendly farewells to Nello, as he\r\nretreated with a bow to Romola and a beck to Tito. The acute barber saw\r\nthat the pretty youngster, who had crept into his liking by some strong\r\nmagic, was well launched in Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s favourable regard; and satisfied\r\nthat his introduction had not miscarried so far, he felt the propriety\r\nof retiring.\r\n\r\nThe little burst of wrath, called forth by Nello\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky quotation,\r\nhad diverted Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s mind from the feelings which had just before been\r\nhemming in further speech, and he now addressed Tito again with his\r\nordinary calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! young man, you are happy in having been able to unite the\r\nadvantages of travel with those of study, and you will be welcome among\r\nus as a bringer of fresh tidings from a land which has become sadly\r\nstrange to us, except through the agents of a now restricted commerce\r\nand the reports of hasty pilgrims. For those days are in the far\r\ndistance which I myself witnessed, when men like Aurispa and Guarino\r\nwent out to Greece as to a storehouse, and came back laden with\r\nmanuscripts which every scholar was eager to borrow\xe2\x80\x94and, be it owned\r\nwith shame, not always willing to restore; nay, even the days when\r\nerudite Greeks flocked to our shores for a refuge, seem far-off\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94farther off than the on-coming of my blindness. But doubtless,\r\nyoung man, research after the treasures of antiquity was not alien to\r\nthe purpose of your travels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, my companion\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94was willing to risk his life in his zeal for the discovery of\r\ninscriptions and other traces of ancient civilisation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I trust there is a record of his researches and their results,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bardo, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9csince they must be even more precious than those\r\nof Ciriaco, which I have diligently availed myself of, though they are\r\nnot always illuminated by adequate learning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _was_ such a record,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was lost, like\r\neverything else, in the shipwreck I suffered below Ancona. The only\r\nrecord left is such as remains in our\xe2\x80\x94in my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must lose no time in committing it to paper, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBardo, with growing interest. \xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless you remember much, if you\r\naided in transcription; for when I was your age, words wrought\r\nthemselves into my mind as if they had been fixed by the tool of the\r\ngraver; wherefore I constantly marvel at the capriciousness of my\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s memory, which grasps certain objects with tenacity, and lets\r\nfall all those minutiae whereon depends accuracy, the very soul of\r\nscholarship. But I apprehend no such danger with you, young man, if\r\nyour will has seconded the advantages of your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Bardo made this reference to his daughter, Tito ventured to turn\r\nhis eyes towards her, and at the accusation against her memory his face\r\nbroke into its brightest smile, which was reflected as inevitably as\r\nsudden sunbeams in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s. Conceive the soothing delight of that\r\nsmile to her! Romola had never dreamed that there was a scholar in the\r\nworld who would smile at a deficiency for which she was constantly made\r\nto feel herself a culprit. It was like the dawn of a new sense to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94the sense of comradeship. They did not look away from each other\r\nimmediately, as if the smile had been a stolen one; they looked and\r\nsmiled with frank enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not really so cold and proud,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Tito.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes _he_ forget too, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cYet I hope not, else\r\nhe will vex my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Tito was obliged to turn away, and answer Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had much practice in transcription,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the case\r\nof inscriptions copied in memorable scenes, rendered doubly impressive\r\nby the sense of risk and adventure, it may have happened that my\r\nretention of written characters has been weakened. On the plain of the\r\nEurotas, or among the gigantic stones of Mycenae and Tyrins\xe2\x80\x94especially\r\nwhen the fear of the Turk hovers over one like a vulture\xe2\x80\x94the mind\r\nwanders, even though the hand writes faithfully what the eye dictates.\r\nBut something doubtless I have retained,\xe2\x80\x9d added Tito, with a modesty\r\nwhich was not false, though he was conscious that it was politic,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csomething that might be of service if illustrated and corrected by a\r\nwider learning than my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well spoken, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will\r\nnot withhold from you such aid as I can give, if you like to\r\ncommunicate with me concerning your recollections. I foresee a work\r\nwhich will be a useful supplement to the \xe2\x80\x98Isolario\xe2\x80\x99 of Christoforo\r\nBuondelmonte, and which may take rank with the \xe2\x80\x98Itineraria\xe2\x80\x99 of Ciriaco\r\nand the admirable Ambrogio Traversari. But we must prepare ourselves\r\nfor calumny, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d Bardo went on with energy, as if the work were\r\nalready growing so fast that the time of trial was near; \xe2\x80\x9cif your book\r\ncontains novelties you will be charged with forgery; if my elucidations\r\nshould clash with any principles of interpretation adopted by another\r\nscholar, our personal characters will be attacked, we shall be\r\nimpeached with foul actions; you must prepare yourself to be told that\r\nyour mother was a fish-woman, and that your father was a renegade\r\npriest or a hanged malefactor. I myself, for having shown error in a\r\nsingle preposition, had an invective written against me wherein I was\r\ntaxed with treachery, fraud, indecency, and even hideous crimes. Such,\r\nmy young friend\xe2\x80\x94such are the flowers with which the glorious path of\r\nscholarship is strewed! But tell me, then: I have learned much\r\nconcerning Byzantium and Thessalonica long ago from Demetrio\r\nCalcondila, who has but lately departed from Florence; but you, it\r\nseems, have visited less familiar scenes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; we made what I may call a pilgrimage full of danger, for the sake\r\nof visiting places which have almost died out of the memory of the\r\nWest, for they lie away from the track of pilgrims; and my father used\r\nto say that scholars themselves hardly imagine them to have any\r\nexistence out of books. He was of opinion that a new and more glorious\r\nera would open for learning when men should begin to look for their\r\ncommentaries on the ancient writers in the remains of cities and\r\ntemples, nay, in the paths of the rivers, and on the face of the\r\nvalleys and the mountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, fervidly, \xe2\x80\x9cyour father, then, was not a common man.\r\nWas he fortunate, may I ask? Had he many friends?\xe2\x80\x9d These last words\r\nwere uttered in a tone charged with meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he made enemies\xe2\x80\x94chiefly, I believe, by a certain impetuous\r\ncandour; and they hindered his advancement, so that he lived in\r\nobscurity. And he would never stoop to conciliate: he could never\r\nforget an injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo again, with a long, deep intonation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong our hazardous expeditions,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Tito, willing to prevent\r\nfurther questions on a point so personal, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember with particular\r\nvividness a hastily snatched visit to Athens. Our hurry, and the double\r\ndanger of being seized as prisoners by the Turks, and of our galley\r\nraising anchor before we could return, made it seem like a fevered\r\nvision of the night\xe2\x80\x94the wide plain, the girdling mountains, the ruined\r\nporticos and columns, either standing far aloof, as if receding from\r\nour hurried footsteps, or else jammed in confusedly among the dwellings\r\nof Christians degraded into servitude, or among the forts and turrets\r\nof their Moslem conquerors, who have their stronghold on the\r\nAcropolis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fill me with surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo. \xe2\x80\x9cAthens, then, is not utterly\r\ndestroyed and swept away, as I had imagined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder you should be under that mistake, for few even of the Greeks\r\nthemselves, who live beyond the mountain boundary of Attica, know\r\nanything about the present condition of Athens, or _Setine_, as the\r\nsailors call it. I remember, as we were rounding the promontory of\r\nSunium, the Greek pilot we had on board our Venetian galley pointed to\r\nthe mighty columns that stand on the summit of the rock\xe2\x80\x94the remains, as\r\nyou know well, of the great temple erected to the goddess Athena, who\r\nlooked down from that high shrine with triumph at her conquered rival\r\nPoseidon;\xe2\x80\x94well, our Greek pilot, pointing to those columns, said, \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nwas the school of the great philosopher Aristotle.\xe2\x80\x99 And at Athens\r\nitself, the monk who acted as our guide in the hasty view we snatched,\r\ninsisted most on showing us the spot where Saint Philip baptised the\r\nEthiopian eunuch, or some such legend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk not of monks and their legends, young man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo,\r\ninterrupting Tito impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough to overlay human hope and\r\nenterprise with an eternal frost to think that the ground which was\r\ntrodden by philosophers and poets is crawled over by those\r\ninsect-swarms of besotted fanatics or howling hypocrites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Perdio_, I have no affection for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with a shrug;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cservitude agrees well with a religion like theirs, which lies in the\r\nrenunciation of all that makes life precious to other men. And they\r\ncarry the yoke that befits them: their matin chant is drowned by the\r\nvoice of the muezzin, who, from the gallery of the high tower on the\r\nAcropolis, calls every Mussulman to his prayers. That tower springs\r\nfrom the Parthenon itself; and every time we paused and directed our\r\neyes towards it, our guide set up a wail, that a temple which had once\r\nbeen won from the diabolical uses of the pagans to become the temple of\r\nanother virgin than Pallas\xe2\x80\x94the Virgin Mother of God\xe2\x80\x94was now again\r\nperverted to the accursed ends of the Moslem. It was the sight of those\r\nwalls of the Acropolis, which disclosed themselves in the distance as\r\nwe leaned over the side of our galley when it was forced by contrary\r\nwinds to anchor in the Piraeus, that fired my father\xe2\x80\x99s mind with the\r\ndetermination to see Athens at all risks, and in spite of the sailors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwarnings that if we lingered till a change of wind, they would depart\r\nwithout us: but, after all, it was impossible for us to venture near\r\nthe Acropolis, for the sight of men eager in examining \xe2\x80\x98old stones\xe2\x80\x99\r\nraised the suspicion that we were Venetian spies, and we had to hurry\r\nback to the harbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk more of these things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nrecall everything, to the minutest trace left in your memory. You will\r\nwin the gratitude of after-times by leaving a record of the aspect\r\nGreece bore while yet the barbarians had not swept away every trace of\r\nthe structures that Pausanias and Pliny described: you will take those\r\ngreat writers as your models; and such contribution of criticism and\r\nsuggestion as my riper mind can supply shall not be wanting to you.\r\nThere will be much to tell; for you have travelled, you said, in the\r\nPeloponnesus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and in Boeotia also: I have rested in the groves of Helicon, and\r\ntasted of the fountain Hippocrene. But on every memorable spot in\r\nGreece conquest after conquest has set its seal, till there is a\r\nconfusion of ownership even in ruins, that only close study and\r\ncomparison could unravel. High over every fastness, from the plains of\r\nLacedaemon to the straits of Thermopylae, there towers some huge\r\nFrankish fortress, once inhabited by a French or Italian marquis, now\r\neither abandoned or held by Turkish bands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bardo, whose mind was now too thoroughly preoccupied by\r\nthe idea of the future book to attend to Tito\xe2\x80\x99s further narration. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou think of writing in Latin or Greek? Doubtless Greek is the more\r\nready clothing for your thoughts, and it is the nobler language. But,\r\non the other hand, Latin is the tongue in which we shall measure\r\nourselves with the larger and more famous number of modern rivals. And\r\nif you are less at ease in it, I will aid you\xe2\x80\x94yes, I will spend on you\r\nthat long-accumulated study which was to have been thrown into the\r\nchannel of another work\xe2\x80\x94a work in which I myself was to have had a\r\nhelpmate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo paused a moment, and then added\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who knows whether that work may not be executed yet? For you, too,\r\nyoung man, have been brought up by a father who poured into your mind\r\nall the long-gathered stream of his knowledge and experience. Our aid\r\nmight be mutual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola, who had watched her father\xe2\x80\x99s growing excitement, and divined\r\nwell the invisible currents of feeling that determined every question\r\nand remark, felt herself in a glow of strange anxiety: she turned her\r\neyes on Tito continually, to watch the impression her father\xe2\x80\x99s words\r\nmade on him, afraid lest he should be inclined to dispel these visions\r\nof co-operation which were lighting up her father\xe2\x80\x99s face with a new\r\nhope. But no! He looked so bright and gentle: he must feel, as she did,\r\nthat in this eagerness of blind age there was piteousness enough to\r\ncall forth inexhaustible patience. How much more strongly he would feel\r\nthis if he knew about her brother! A girl of eighteen imagines the\r\nfeelings behind the face that has moved her with its sympathetic youth,\r\nas easily as primitive people imagined the humours of the gods in fair\r\nweather: what is she to believe in, if not in this vision woven from\r\nwithin?\r\n\r\nAnd Tito was really very far from feeling impatient. He delighted in\r\nsitting there with the sense that Romola\xe2\x80\x99s attention was fixed on him,\r\nand that he could occasionally look at her. He was pleased that Bardo\r\nshould take an interest in him; and he did not dwell with enough\r\nseriousness on the prospect of the work in which he was to be aided, to\r\nfeel moved by it to anything else than that easy, good-humoured\r\nacquiescence which was natural to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be proud and happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in answer to Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s last words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif my services can be held a meet offering to the matured scholarship\r\nof Messere. But doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here he looked towards Romola\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe lovely\r\ndamigella, your daughter, makes all other aid superfluous; for I have\r\nlearned from Nello that she has been nourished on the highest studies\r\nfrom her earliest years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola; \xe2\x80\x9cI am by no means sufficient to my\r\nfather: I have not the gifts that are necessary for scholarship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola did not make this self-depreciatory statement in a tone of\r\nanxious humility, but with a proud gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, not willing that the stranger should\r\nhave too low a conception of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s powers; \xe2\x80\x9cthou art not\r\ndestitute of gifts; rather, thou art endowed beyond the measure of\r\nwomen; but thou hast withal the woman\xe2\x80\x99s delicate frame, which ever\r\ncraves repose and variety, and so begets a wandering imagination. My\r\ndaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94turning to Tito\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas been very precious to me, filling up to\r\nthe best of her power the place of a son. For I had once a son...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo checked himself: he did not wish to assume an attitude of\r\ncomplaint in the presence of a stranger, and he remembered that this\r\nyoung man, in whom he had unexpectedly become so much interested, was\r\nstill a stranger, towards whom it became him rather to keep the\r\nposition of a patron. His pride was roused to double activity by the\r\nfear that he had forgotten his dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, in his original tone of condescension, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are\r\ndeparting from what I believe is to you the most important business.\r\nNello informed me that you had certain gems which you would fain\r\ndispose of, and that you desired a passport to some man of wealth and\r\ntaste who would be likely to become a purchaser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true; for, though I have obtained employment, as a corrector\r\nwith the Cennini, my payment leaves little margin beyond the provision\r\nof necessaries, and would leave less but that my good friend Nello\r\ninsists on my hiring a lodging from him, and saying nothing about the\r\nrent till better days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNello is a good-hearted prodigal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo; \xe2\x80\x9cand though, with that\r\nready ear and ready tongue of his, he is too much like the ill-famed\r\nMargites\xe2\x80\x94knowing many things and knowing them all badly, as I hinted to\r\nhim but now\xe2\x80\x94he is nevertheless \xe2\x80\x98abnormis sapiens,\xe2\x80\x99 after the manner of\r\nour born Florentines. But have you the gems with you? I would willingly\r\nknow what they are\xe2\x80\x94yet it is useless: no, it might only deepen regret.\r\nI cannot add to my store.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have one or two intaglios of much beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, proceeding to\r\ndraw from his wallet a small case.\r\n\r\nBut Romola no sooner saw the movement than she looked at him with\r\nsignificant gravity, and placed her finger on her lips\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCon viso che tacendo dicea, Taci.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Bardo were made aware that the gems were within reach, she knew well\r\nhe would want a minute description of them, and it would become pain to\r\nhim that they should go away from him, even if he did not insist on\r\nsome device for purchasing them in spite of poverty. But she had no\r\nsooner made this sign than she felt rather guilty and ashamed at having\r\nvirtually confessed a weakness of her father\xe2\x80\x99s to a stranger. It seemed\r\nthat she was destined to a sudden confidence and familiarity with this\r\nyoung Greek, strangely at variance with her deep-seated pride and\r\nreserve; and this consciousness again brought the unwonted colour to\r\nher cheeks.\r\n\r\nTito understood her look and sign, and immediately withdrew his hand\r\nfrom the case, saying, in a careless tone, so as to make it appear that\r\nhe was merely following up his last words, \xe2\x80\x9cBut they are usually in the\r\nkeeping of Messer Domenico Cennini, who has strong and safe places for\r\nthese things. He estimates them as worth at least five hundred ducats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, they are fine intagli,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo. \xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred ducats!\r\nAh, more than a man\xe2\x80\x99s ransom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito gave a slight, almost imperceptible start, and opened his long\r\ndark eyes with questioning surprise at Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s blind face, as if his\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94a mere phrase of common parlance, at a time when men were often\r\nbeing ransomed from slavery or imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94had had some special\r\nmeaning for him. But the next moment he looked towards Romola, as if\r\nher eyes must be her father\xe2\x80\x99s interpreters. She, intensely preoccupied\r\nwith what related to her father, imagined that Tito was looking to her\r\nagain for some guidance, and immediately spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlessandra Scala delights in gems, you know, father; she calls them\r\nher winter flowers; and the Segretario would be almost sure to buy any\r\ngems that she wished for. Besides, he himself sets great store by rings\r\nand sigils, which he wears as a defence against pains in the joints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo. \xe2\x80\x9cBartolommeo has overmuch confidence in the\r\nefficacy of gems\xe2\x80\x94a confidence wider than what is sanctioned by Pliny,\r\nwho clearly shows that he regards many beliefs of that sort as idle\r\nsuperstitions; though not to the utter denial of medicinal virtues in\r\ngems. Wherefore, I myself, as you observe, young man, wear certain\r\nrings, which the discreet Camillo Leonardi prescribed to me by letter\r\nwhen two years ago I had a certain infirmity of sudden numbness. But\r\nthou hast spoken well, Romola. I will dictate a letter to Bartolommeo,\r\nwhich Maso shall carry. But it were well that Messere should notify to\r\nthee what the gems are, together with the intagli they bear, as a\r\nwarrant to Bartolommeo that they will be worthy of his attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, whose dread lest a paroxysm of the\r\ncollector\xe2\x80\x99s mania should seize her father, gave her the courage to\r\nresist his proposal. \xe2\x80\x9cYour word will be sufficient that Messere is a\r\nscholar and has travelled much. The Segretario will need no further\r\ninducement to receive him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, touched on a chord that was sure to respond.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no need to add proofs and arguments in confirmation of my word\r\nto Bartolommeo. And I doubt not that this young man\xe2\x80\x99s presence is in\r\naccord with the tones of his voice, so that, the door being once\r\nopened, he will be his own best advocate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo paused a few moments, but his silence was evidently charged with\r\nsome idea that he was hesitating to express, for he once leaned forward\r\na little as if he were going to speak, then turned his head aside\r\ntowards Romola and sank backward again. At last, as if he had made up\r\nhis mind, he said in a tone which might have become a prince giving the\r\ncourteous signal of dismissal\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am somewhat fatigued this morning, and shall prefer seeing you again\r\nto-morrow, when I shall be able to give you the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s answer,\r\nauthorising you to present yourself to him at some given time. But\r\nbefore you go,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here the old man, in spite of himself, fell into a more\r\nfaltering tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou will perhaps permit me to touch your hand? It is\r\nlong since I touched the hand of a young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo had stretched out his aged white hand, and Tito immediately\r\nplaced his dark but delicate and supple fingers within it. Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncramped fingers closed over them, and he held them for a few minutes in\r\nsilence. Then he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola, has this young man the same complexion as thy brother\xe2\x80\x94fair and\r\npale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father,\xe2\x80\x9d Romola answered, with determined composure, though her\r\nheart began to beat violently with mingled emotions. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hair of\r\nMessere is dark\xe2\x80\x94his complexion is dark.\xe2\x80\x9d Inwardly she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill he\r\nmind it? will it be disagreeable? No, he looks so gentle and\r\ngood-natured.\xe2\x80\x9d Then aloud again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould Messere permit my father to touch his hair and face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes inevitably made a timid entreating appeal while she asked\r\nthis, and Tito\xe2\x80\x99s met them with soft brightness as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand, leaning forward, raised Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s hand to his curls, with a\r\nreadiness of assent, which was the greater relief to her, because it\r\nwas unaccompanied by any sign of embarrassment.\r\n\r\nBardo passed his hand again and again over the long curls and grasped\r\nthem a little, as if their spiral resistance made his inward vision\r\nclearer; then he passed his hand over the brow and cheek, tracing the\r\nprofile with the edge of his palm and fourth finger, and letting the\r\nbreadth of his hand repose on the rich oval of the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as his hand glided from the face and rested on the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be very unlike thy brother, Romola: and it is\r\nthe better. You see no visions, I trust, my young friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened, and there entered, unannounced, a tall\r\nelderly man in a handsome black silk lucco, who, unwinding his\r\nbecchetto from his neck and taking off his cap, disclosed a head as\r\nwhite as Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s. He cast a keen glance of surprise at the group before\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94the young stranger leaning in that filial attitude, while Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand rested on his shoulder, and Romola sitting near with eyes dilated\r\nby anxiety and agitation. But there was an instantaneous change: Bardo\r\nlet fall his hand, Tito raised himself from his stooping posture, and\r\nRomola rose to meet the visitor with an alacrity which implied all the\r\ngreater intimacy, because it was unaccompanied by any smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, god-daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stately man, as he touched Romola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cMaso said you had a visitor, but I came in nevertheless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is thou, Bernardo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo. \xe2\x80\x9cThou art come at a fortunate\r\nmoment. This, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, while Tito rose and bowed, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\none of the chief citizens of Florence, Messer Bernardo del Nero, my\r\noldest, I had almost said my only friend\xe2\x80\x94whose good opinion, if you can\r\nwin it, may carry you far. He is but three-and-twenty, Bernardo, yet he\r\ncan doubtless tell thee much which thou wilt care to hear; for though a\r\nscholar, he has already travelled far, and looked on other things\r\nbesides the manuscripts for which thou hast too light an esteem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, a Greek, as I augur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, returning Tito\xe2\x80\x99s reverence\r\nbut slightly, and surveying him with that sort of glance which seems\r\nalmost to cut like fine steel. \xe2\x80\x9cNewly arrived in Florence, it appears.\r\nThe name of Messere\xe2\x80\x94or part of it, for it is doubtless a long one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with perfect good-humour, \xe2\x80\x9cit is most\r\nmodestly free from polysyllabic pomp. My name is Tito Melema.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, rather scornfully, as he took a seat; \xe2\x80\x9cI had\r\nexpected it to be at least as long as the names of a city, a river, a\r\nprovince, and an empire all put together. We Florentines mostly use\r\nnames as we do prawns, and strip them of all flourishes before we trust\r\nthem to our throats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bardo,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as if the stranger were not worth further\r\nnotice, and changing his tone of sarcastic suspicion for one of\r\nsadness, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have buried him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bardo, with corresponding sadness, \xe2\x80\x9cand a new epoch has\r\ncome for Florence\xe2\x80\x94a dark one, I fear. Lorenzo has left behind him an\r\ninheritance that is but like the alchemist\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory when the wisdom\r\nof the alchemist is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot altogether so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo. \xe2\x80\x9cPiero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici has abundant\r\nintelligence; his faults are only the faults of hot blood. I love the\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x94lad he will always be to me, as I have always been \xe2\x80\x98little father\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet all who want a new order of things are likely to conceive new\r\nhopes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have the old strife of parties, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we could have a new order of things that was something else than\r\nknocking down one coat of arms to put up another,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould be ready to say, \xe2\x80\x98I belong to no party: I am a Florentine.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nas long as parties are in question, I am a Medicean, and will be a\r\nMedicean till I die. I am of the same mind as Farinata degli Uberti: if\r\nany man asks me what is meant by siding with a party, I say, as he did,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To wish ill or well, for the sake of past wrongs or kindnesses.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this short dialogue, Tito had been standing, and now took his\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut come again at the same hour to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, graciously,\r\nbefore Tito left the room, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I may give you Bartolommeo\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what quarter of the sky has this pretty Greek youngster alighted\r\nso close to thy chair, Bardo?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo del Nero, as the door\r\nclosed. He spoke with dry emphasis, evidently intended to convey\r\nsomething more to Bardo than was implied by the mere words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a scholar who has been shipwrecked and has saved a few gems, for\r\nwhich he wants to find a purchaser. I am going to send him to\r\nBartolommeo Scala, for thou knowest it were more prudent in me to\r\nabstain from further purchases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBernardo shrugged his shoulders and said, \xe2\x80\x9cRomola, wilt thou see if my\r\nservant is without? I ordered him to wait for me here.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, when\r\nRomola was at a sufficient distance, he leaned forward and said to\r\nBardo in a low, emphatic tone\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, Bardo, thou hast a rare gem of thy own; take care no one\r\ngets it who is not likely to pay a worthy price. That pretty Greek has\r\na lithe sleekness about him, that seems marvellously fitted for\r\nslipping easily into any nest he fixes his mind on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo was startled: the association of Tito with the image of his lost\r\nson had excluded instead of suggesting the thought of Romola. But\r\nalmost immediately there seemed to be a reaction which made him grasp\r\nthe warning as if it had been a hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not, Bernardo? If the young man approved himself worthy\xe2\x80\x94he is\r\na scholar\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and there would be no difficulty about the dowry, which\r\nalways makes thee gloomy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA Learned Squabble.\r\n\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Scala, secretary of the Florentine Republic, on whom Tito\r\nMelema had been thus led to anchor his hopes, lived in a handsome\r\npalace close to the Porta Pinti, now known as the Casa Gherardesca. His\r\narms\xe2\x80\x94an azure ladder transverse on a golden field, with the motto\r\n_Gradatim_ placed over the entrance\xe2\x80\x94told all comers that the miller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson held his ascent to honours by his own efforts a fact to be\r\nproclaimed without wincing. The secretary was a vain and pompous man,\r\nbut he was also an honest one: he was sincerely convinced of his own\r\nmerit, and could see no reason for feigning. The topmost round of his\r\nazure ladder had been reached by this time: he had held his\r\nsecretaryship these twenty years\xe2\x80\x94had long since made his orations on\r\nthe _ringhiera_, or platform of the Old Palace, as the custom was, in\r\nthe presence of princely visitors, while Marzocco, the republican lion,\r\nwore his gold crown on the occasion, and all the people cried, \xe2\x80\x9cViva\r\nMesser Bartolommeo!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94had been on an embassy to Rome, and had there been\r\nmade titular Senator, Apostolical Secretary, Knight of the Golden Spur;\r\nand had, eight years ago, been Gonfaloniere\xe2\x80\x94last goal of the Florentine\r\ncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s ambition. Meantime he had got richer and richer, and more and\r\nmore gouty, after the manner of successful mortality; and the Knight of\r\nthe Golden Spur had often to sit with helpless cushioned heel under the\r\nhandsome loggia he had built for himself, overlooking the spacious\r\ngardens and lawn at the back of his palace.\r\n\r\nHe was in this position on the day when he had granted the desired\r\ninterview to Tito Melema. The May afternoon sun was on the flowers and\r\nthe grass beyond the pleasant shade of the loggia; the too stately silk\r\nlucco was cast aside, and the light loose mantle was thrown over his\r\ntunic; his beautiful daughter Alessandra and her husband, the Greek\r\nsoldier-poet Marullo, were seated on one side of him: on the other, two\r\nfriends not oppressively illustrious, and therefore the better\r\nlisteners. Yet, to say nothing of the gout, Messer Bartolommeo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfelicity was far from perfect: it was embittered by the contents of\r\ncertain papers that lay before him, consisting chiefly of a\r\ncorrespondence between himself and Politian. It was a human foible at\r\nthat period (incredible as it may seem) to recite quarrels, and favour\r\nscholarly visitors with the communication of an entire and lengthy\r\ncorrespondence; and this was neither the first nor the second time that\r\nScala had asked the candid opinion of his friends as to the balance of\r\nright and wrong in some half-score Latin letters between himself and\r\nPolitian, all springing out of certain epigrams written in the most\r\nplayful tone in the world. It was the story of a very typical and\r\npretty quarrel, in which we are interested, because it supplied\r\nprecisely that thistle of hatred necessary, according to Nello, as a\r\nstimulus to the sluggish paces of the cautious steed, Friendship.\r\nPolitian, having been a rejected pretender to the love and the hand of\r\nScala\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, kept a very sharp and learned tooth in readiness\r\nagainst the too prosperous and presumptuous secretary, who had declined\r\nthe greatest scholar of the age for a son-in-law. Scala was a\r\nmeritorious public servant, and, moreover, a lucky man\xe2\x80\x94naturally\r\nexasperating to an offended scholar; but then\xe2\x80\x94O beautiful balance of\r\nthings!\xe2\x80\x94he had an itch for authorship, and was a bad writer\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthose excellent people who, sitting in gouty slippers, \xe2\x80\x9cpenned poetical\r\ntrifles\xe2\x80\x9d entirely for their own amusement, without any view to an\r\naudience, and, consequently, sent them to their friends in letters,\r\nwhich were the literary periodicals of the fifteenth century. Now Scala\r\nhad abundance of friends who were ready to praise his writings: friends\r\nlike Ficino and Landino\xe2\x80\x94amiable browsers in the Medicean park along\r\nwith himself\xe2\x80\x94who found his Latin prose style elegant and masculine; and\r\nthe terrible Joseph Scaliger, who was to pronounce him totally ignorant\r\nof Latinity, was at a comfortable distance in the next century. But\r\nwhen was the fatal coquetry inherent in superfluous authorship ever\r\nquite contented with the ready praise of friends? That critical\r\nsupercilious Politian\xe2\x80\x94a fellow-browser, who was far from amiable\xe2\x80\x94must\r\nbe made aware that the solid secretary showed, in his leisure hours, a\r\npleasant fertility in verses, which indicated pretty clearly how much\r\nhe might do in that way if he were not a man of affairs.\r\n\r\nIneffable moment! when the man you secretly hate sends you a Latin\r\nepigram with a false gender\xe2\x80\x94hendecasyllables with a questionable\r\nelision, at least a toe too much\xe2\x80\x94attempts at poetic figures which are\r\nmanifest solecisms. That moment had come to Politian: the secretary had\r\nput forth his soft head from the official shell, and the terrible\r\nlurking crab was down upon him. Politian had used the freedom of a\r\nfriend, and pleasantly, in the form of a Latin epigram, corrected the\r\nmistake of Scala in making the _culex_ (an insect too well-known on the\r\nbanks of the Arno) of the inferior or feminine gender. Scala replied by\r\na bad joke, in suitable Latin verses, referring to Politian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunsuccessful suit. Better and better. Politian found the verses very\r\npretty and highly facetious: the more was the pity that they were\r\nseriously incorrect, and inasmuch as Scala had alleged that he had\r\nwritten them in imitation of a Greek epigram, Politian, being on such\r\nfriendly terms, would enclose a Greek epigram of his own, on the same\r\ninteresting insect\xe2\x80\x94not, we may presume, out of any wish to humble\r\nScala, but rather to instruct him; said epigram containing a lively\r\nconceit about Venus, Cupid, and the _culex_, of a kind much tasted at\r\nthat period, founded partly on the zoological fact that the gnat, like\r\nVenus, was born from the waters. Scala, in reply, begged to say that\r\nhis verses were never intended for a scholar with such delicate\r\nolfactories as Politian, nearest of all living men to the perfection of\r\nthe ancients, and of a taste so fastidious that sturgeon itself must\r\nseem insipid to him; defended his own verses, nevertheless, though\r\nindeed they were written hastily, without correction, and intended as\r\nan agreeable distraction during the summer heat to himself and such\r\nfriends as were satisfied with mediocrity, he, Scala, not being like\r\nsome other people, who courted publicity through the booksellers. For\r\nthe rest, he had barely enough Greek to make out the sense of the\r\nepigram so graciously sent him, to say nothing of tasting its\r\nelegances; but\xe2\x80\x94the epigram was Politian\xe2\x80\x99s: what more need be said?\r\nStill, by way of postscript, he feared that his incomparable friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomparison of the gnat to Venus, on account of its origin from the\r\nwaters, was in many ways ticklish. On the one hand, Venus might be\r\noffended; and on the other, unless the poet intended an allusion to the\r\ndoctrine of Thales, that cold and damp origin seemed doubtful to Scala\r\nin the case of a creature so fond of warmth; a fish were perhaps the\r\nbetter comparison, or, when the power of flying was in question, an\r\neagle, or indeed, when the darkness was taken into consideration, a bat\r\nor an owl were a less obscure and more apposite parallel, etcetera,\r\netcetera. Here was a great opportunity for Politian. He was not aware,\r\nhe wrote, that when he had Scala\xe2\x80\x99s verses placed before him, there was\r\nany question of sturgeon, but rather of frogs and gudgeons: made short\r\nwork with Scala\xe2\x80\x99s defence of his own Latin, and mangled him terribly on\r\nthe score of the stupid criticisms he had ventured on the Greek epigram\r\nkindly forwarded to him as a model. Wretched cavils, indeed! for as to\r\nthe damp origin of the gnat, there was the authority of Virgil himself,\r\nwho had called it the \xe2\x80\x9c_alumnus_ of the waters;\xe2\x80\x9d and as to what his\r\ndear dull friend had to say about the fish, the eagle, and the rest, it\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cnihil ad rem;\xe2\x80\x9d for because the eagle could fly higher, it by no\r\nmeans followed that the gnat could not fly at all, etcetera, etcetera.\r\nHe was ashamed, however, to dwell on such trivialities, and thus to\r\nswell a gnat into an elephant; but, for his own part, would only add\r\nthat he had nothing deceitful or double about him, neither was he to be\r\ncaught when present by the false blandishments of those who slandered\r\nhim in his absence, agreeing rather with a Homeric sentiment on that\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94which furnished a Greek quotation to serve as powder to his\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel could not end there. The logic could hardly get worse, but\r\nthe secretary got more pompously self-asserting, and the scholarly\r\npoet\xe2\x80\x99s temper more and more venomous. Politian had been generously\r\nwilling to hold up a mirror, by which the too-inflated secretary,\r\nbeholding his own likeness, might be induced to cease setting up his\r\nignorant defences of bad Latin against ancient authorities whom the\r\nconsent of centuries had placed beyond question,\xe2\x80\x94unless, indeed, he had\r\ndesigned to sink in literature in proportion as he rose in honours,\r\nthat by a sort of compensation men of letters might feel themselves his\r\nequals. In return, Politian was begged to examine Scala\xe2\x80\x99s writings:\r\nnowhere would he find a more devout admiration of antiquity. The\r\nsecretary was ashamed of the age in which he lived, and blushed for it.\r\n_Some_, indeed, there were who wanted to have their own works praised\r\nand exalted to a level with the divine monuments of antiquity; but he,\r\nScala, could not oblige them. And as to the honours which were\r\noffensive to the envious, they had been well earned: witness his whole\r\nlife since he came in penury to Florence. The elegant scholar, in\r\nreply, was not surprised that Scala found the Age distasteful to him,\r\nsince he himself was so distasteful to the Age; nay, it was with\r\nperfect accuracy that he, the elegant scholar, had called Scala a\r\nbranny monster, inasmuch as he was formed from the off-scourings of\r\nmonsters, born amidst the refuse of a mill, and eminently worthy the\r\nlong-eared office of turning the paternal millstones (_in pistrini\r\nsordibus natus et quidem pistrino dignissimus_)!\r\n\r\nIt was not without reference to Tito\xe2\x80\x99s appointed visit that the papers\r\ncontaining this correspondence were brought out to-day. Here was a new\r\nGreek scholar whose accomplishments were to be tested, and on nothing\r\ndid Scala more desire a dispassionate opinion from persons of superior\r\nknowledge than on that Greek epigram of Politian\xe2\x80\x99s. After sufficient\r\nintroductory talk concerning Tito\xe2\x80\x99s travels, after a survey and\r\ndiscussion of the gems, and an easy passage from the mention of the\r\nlamented Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness in collecting such specimens of ancient\r\nart to the subject of classical tastes and studies in general and their\r\npresent condition in Florence, it was inevitable to mention Politian, a\r\nman of eminent ability indeed, but a little too arrogant\xe2\x80\x94assuming to be\r\na Hercules, whose office it was to destroy all the literary\r\nmonstrosities of the age, and writing letters to his elders without\r\nsigning them, as if they were miraculous revelations that could only\r\nhave one source. And after all, were not his own criticisms often\r\nquestionable and his tastes perverse? He was fond of saying pungent\r\nthings about the men who thought they wrote like Cicero because they\r\nended every sentence with \xe2\x80\x9cesse videtur:\xe2\x80\x9d but while he was boasting of\r\nhis freedom from servile imitation, did he not fall into the other\r\nextreme, running after strange words and affected phrases? Even in his\r\nmuch-belauded \xe2\x80\x98Miscellanea\xe2\x80\x99 was every point tenable? And Tito, who had\r\njust been looking into the \xe2\x80\x98Miscellanea,\xe2\x80\x99 found so much to say that was\r\nagreeable to the secretary\xe2\x80\x94he would have done so from the mere\r\ndisposition to please, without further motive\xe2\x80\x94that he showed himself\r\nquite worthy to be made a judge in the notable correspondence\r\nconcerning the _culex_. Here was the Greek epigram which Politian had\r\ndoubtless thought the finest in the world, though he had pretended to\r\nbelieve that the \xe2\x80\x9ctransmarini,\xe2\x80\x9d the Greeks themselves, would make light\r\nof it: had he not been unintentionally speaking the truth in his false\r\nmodesty?\r\n\r\nTito was ready, and scarified the epigram to Scala\xe2\x80\x99s content. O wise\r\nyoung judge! He could doubtless appreciate satire even in the vulgar\r\ntongue, and Scala\xe2\x80\x94who, excellent man, not seeking publicity through the\r\nbooksellers, was never unprovided with \xe2\x80\x9chasty uncorrected trifles,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\na sort of sherbet for a visitor on a hot day, or, if the weather were\r\ncold, why then as a cordial\xe2\x80\x94had a few little matters in the shape of\r\nSonnets, turning on well-known foibles of Politian\xe2\x80\x99s, which he would\r\nnot like to go any farther, but which would, perhaps, amuse the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nEnough: Tito took his leave under an urgent invitation to come again.\r\nHis gems were interesting; especially the agate, with the _lusus\r\nnaturae_ in it\xe2\x80\x94a most wonderful semblance of Cupid riding on the lion;\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x9cJew\xe2\x80\x99s stone,\xe2\x80\x9d with the lion-headed serpent enchased in it;\r\nboth of which the secretary agreed to buy\xe2\x80\x94the latter as a reinforcement\r\nof his preventives against the gout, which gave him such severe twinges\r\nthat it was plain enough how intolerable it would be if he were not\r\nwell supplied with rings of rare virtue, and with an amulet worn close\r\nunder the right breast. But Tito was assured that he himself was more\r\ninteresting than his gems. He had won his way to the Scala Palace by\r\nthe recommendation of Bardo de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, who, to be sure, was Scala\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nacquaintance and a worthy scholar, in spite of his overvaluing himself\r\na little (a frequent foible in the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s friends); but he must\r\ncome again on the ground of his own manifest accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThe interview could hardly have ended more auspiciously for Tito, and\r\nas he walked out at the Porta Pinti that he might laugh a little at his\r\nease over the affair of the _culex_, he felt that fortune could hardly\r\nmean to turn her back on him again at present, since she had taken him\r\nby the hand in this decided way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nA Face in the Crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to northern people to rise early on Midsummer morning, to\r\nsee the dew on the grassy edge of the dusty pathway, to notice the\r\nfresh shoots among the darker green of the oak and fir in the coppice,\r\nand to look over the gate at the shorn meadow, without recollecting\r\nthat it is the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nNot so to the Florentine\xe2\x80\x94still less to the Florentine of the fifteenth\r\ncentury: to him on that particular morning the brightness of the\r\neastern sun on the Arno had something special in it; the ringing of the\r\nbells was articulate, and declared it to be the great summer festival\r\nof Florence, the day of San Giovanni.\r\n\r\nSan Giovanni had been the patron saint of Florence for at least eight\r\nhundred years\xe2\x80\x94ever since the time when the Lombard Queen Theodolinda\r\nhad commanded her subjects to do him peculiar honour; nay, says old\r\nVillani, to the best of his knowledge, ever since the days of\r\nConstantino the Great and Pope Sylvester, when the Florentines deposed\r\ntheir idol Mars, whom they were nevertheless careful not to treat with\r\ncontumely; for while they consecrated their beautiful and noble temple\r\nto the honour of God and of the \xe2\x80\x9cBeato Messere Santo Giovanni,\xe2\x80\x9d they\r\nplaced old Mars respectfully on a high tower near the River Arno,\r\nfinding in certain ancient memorials that he had been elected as their\r\ntutelar deity under such astral influences that if he were broken, or\r\notherwise treated with indignity, the city would suffer great damage\r\nand mutation. But in the fifteenth century that discreet regard to the\r\nfeelings of the Man-destroyer had long vanished: the god of the spear\r\nand shield had ceased to frown by the side of the Arno, and the\r\ndefences of the Republic were held to lie in its craft and its coffers.\r\nFor spear and shield could be hired by gold florins, and on the gold\r\nflorins there had always been the image of San Giovanni.\r\n\r\nMuch good had come to Florence since the dim time of struggle between\r\nthe old patron and the new: some quarrelling and bloodshed, doubtless,\r\nbetween Guelf and Ghibelline, between Black and White, between orthodox\r\nsons of the Church and heretic Paterini; some floods, famine, and\r\npestilence; but still much wealth and glory. Florence had achieved\r\nconquests over walled cities once mightier than itself, and especially\r\nover hated Pisa, whose marble buildings were too high and beautiful,\r\nwhose masts were too much honoured on Greek and Italian coasts. The\r\nname of Florence had been growing prouder and prouder in all the courts\r\nof Europe, nay, in Africa itself, on the strength of purest gold\r\ncoinage, finest dyes and textures, pre-eminent scholarship and poetic\r\ngenius, and wits of the most serviceable sort for statesmanship and\r\nbanking: it was a name so omnipresent that a Pope with a turn for\r\nepigram had called Florentines \xe2\x80\x9cthe fifth element.\xe2\x80\x9d And for this high\r\ndestiny, though it might partly depend on the stars and Madonna dell\xe2\x80\x99\r\nImpruneta, and certainly depended on other higher Powers less often\r\nnamed, the praise was greatly due to San Giovanni, whose image was on\r\nthe fair gold florins.\r\n\r\nTherefore it was fitting that the day of San Giovanni\xe2\x80\x94that ancient\r\nChurch festival already venerable in the days of Saint Augustine\xe2\x80\x94should\r\nbe a day of peculiar rejoicing to Florence, and should be ushered in by\r\na vigil duly kept in strict old Florentine fashion, with much dancing,\r\nwith much street jesting, and perhaps with not a little stone-throwing\r\nand window-breaking, but emphatically with certain street sights such\r\nas could only be provided by a city which held in its service a clever\r\nCecca, engineer and architect, valuable alike in sieges and in shows.\r\nBy the help of Cecca, the very saints, surrounded with their\r\nalmond-shaped glory, and floating on clouds with their joyous\r\ncompanionship of winged cherubs, even as they may be seen to this day\r\nin the pictures of Perugino, seemed, on the eve of San Giovanni, to\r\nhave brought their piece of the heavens down into the narrow streets,\r\nand to pass slowly through them; and, more wonderful still, saints of\r\ngigantic size, with attendant angels, might be seen, not seated, but\r\nmoving in a slow mysterious manner along the streets, like a procession\r\nof colossal figures come down from the high domes and tribunes of the\r\nchurches. The clouds were made of good woven stuff, the saints and\r\ncherubs were unglorified mortals supported by firm bars, and those\r\nmysterious giants were really men of very steady brain, balancing\r\nthemselves on stilts, and enlarged, like Greek tragedians, by huge\r\nmasks and stuffed shoulders; but he was a miserably unimaginative\r\nFlorentine who thought only of that\xe2\x80\x94nay, somewhat impious, for in the\r\nimages of sacred things was there not some of the virtue of sacred\r\nthings themselves? And if, after that, there came a company of merry\r\nblack demons well armed with claws and thongs, and other implements of\r\nsport, ready to perform impromptu farces of bastinadoing and\r\nclothes-tearing, why, that was the demons\xe2\x80\x99 way of keeping a vigil, and\r\nthey, too, might have descended from the domes and the tribunes. The\r\nTuscan mind slipped from the devout to the burlesque, as readily as\r\nwater round an angle; and the saints had already had their turn, had\r\ngone their way, and made their due pause before the gates of San\r\nGiovanni, to do him honour on the eve of his _festa_. And on the\r\nmorrow, the great day thus ushered in, it was fitting that the\r\ntributary symbols paid to Florence by all its dependent cities,\r\ndistricts, and villages, whether conquered, protected, or of immemorial\r\npossession, should be offered at the shrine of San Giovanni in the old\r\noctagonal church, once the cathedral and now the baptistery, where\r\nevery Florentine had had the sign of the Cross made with the anointing\r\nchrism on his brow; that all the city, from the white-haired man to the\r\nstripling, and from the matron to the lisping child, should be clothed\r\nin its best to do honour to the great day, and see the great sight; and\r\nthat again, when the sun was sloping and the streets were cool, there\r\nshould be the glorious race or Corso, when the unsaddled horses,\r\nclothed in rich trappings, should run right across the city, from the\r\nPorta al Prato on the north-west, through the Mercato Vecchio, to the\r\nPorta Santa Croce on the south-east, where the richest of _Palii_, or\r\nvelvet and brocade banners with silk linings and fringe of gold, such\r\nas became a city that half-clothed the well-dressed world, were mounted\r\non a triumphal car awaiting the winner or winner\xe2\x80\x99s owner.\r\n\r\nAnd thereafter followed more dancing; nay, through the whole day, says\r\nan old chronicler at the beginning of that century, there were weddings\r\nand the grandest gatherings, with so much piping, music and song, with\r\nballs and feasts and gladness and ornament, that this earth might have\r\nbeen mistaken for Paradise!\r\n\r\nIn this year of 1492, it was, perhaps, a little less easy to make that\r\nmistake. Lorenzo the magnificent and subtle was dead, and an arrogant,\r\nincautious Piero was come in his room, an evil change for Florence,\r\nunless, indeed, the wise horse prefers the bad rider, as more easily\r\nthrown from the saddle, and already the regrets for Lorenzo were\r\ngetting less predominant over the murmured desire for government on a\r\nbroader basis, in which corruption might be arrested, and there might\r\nbe that free play for everybody\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy and ambition, which made the\r\nideal liberty of the good old quarrelsome, struggling times, when\r\nFlorence raised her great buildings, reared her own soldiers, drove out\r\nwould-be tyrants at the sword\xe2\x80\x99s point, and was proud to keep faith at\r\nher own loss. Lorenzo was dead, Pope Innocent was dying, and a\r\ntroublesome Neapolitan succession, with an intriguing, ambitious Milan,\r\nmight set Italy by the ears before long: the times were likely to be\r\ndifficult. Still, there was all the more reason that the Republic\r\nshould keep its religious festivals.\r\n\r\nAnd Midsummer morning, in this year 1492, was not less bright than\r\nusual. It was betimes in the morning that the symbolic offerings to be\r\ncarried in grand procession were all assembled at their starting-point\r\nin the Piazza della Signoria\xe2\x80\x94that famous piazza, where stood then, and\r\nstand now, the massive turreted Palace of the People, called the\r\nPalazzo Vecchio, and the spacious Loggia, built by Orcagna\xe2\x80\x94the scene of\r\nall grand State ceremonial. The sky made the fairest blue tent, and\r\nunder it the bells swung so vigorously that every evil spirit with\r\nsense enough to be formidable, must long since have taken his flight;\r\nwindows and terraced roofs were alive with human faces; sombre stone\r\nhouses were bright with hanging draperies; the boldly soaring palace\r\ntower, the yet older square tower of the Bargello, and the spire of the\r\nneighbouring Badia, seemed to keep watch above; and below, on the broad\r\npolygonal flags of the piazza, was the glorious show of banners, and\r\nhorses with rich trappings, and gigantic _ceri_, or tapers, that were\r\nfitly called towers\xe2\x80\x94strangely aggrandised descendants of those torches\r\nby whose faint light the Church worshipped in the Catacombs. Betimes in\r\nthe morning all processions had need to move under the Midsummer sky of\r\nFlorence, where the shelter of the narrow streets must every now and\r\nthen be exchanged for the glare of wide spaces; and the sun would be\r\nhigh up in the heavens before the long pomp had ended its pilgrimage in\r\nthe Piazza di San Giovanni.\r\n\r\nBut here, where the procession was to pause, the magnificent city, with\r\nits ingenious Cecca, had provided another tent than the sky; for the\r\nwhole of the Piazza del Duomo, from the octagonal baptistery in the\r\ncentre to the fa\xc3\xa7ade of the cathedral and the walls of the houses on\r\nthe other sides of the quadrangle, was covered, at the height of forty\r\nfeet or more, with blue drapery, adorned with well-stitched yellow\r\nlilies and the familiar coats of arms, while sheaves of many-coloured\r\nbanners drooped at fit angles under this superincumbent blue\xe2\x80\x94a gorgeous\r\nrainbow-lit shelter to the waiting spectators who leaned from the\r\nwindows, and made a narrow border on the pavement, and wished for the\r\ncoming of the show.\r\n\r\nOne of these spectators was Tito Melema. Bright, in the midst of\r\nbrightness, he sat at the window of the room above Nello\xe2\x80\x99s shop, his\r\nright elbow resting on the red drapery hanging from the window-sill,\r\nand his head supported in a backward position by the right-hand, which\r\npressed the curls against his ear. His face wore that bland liveliness,\r\nas far removed from excitability as from heaviness or gloom, which\r\nmarks the companion popular alike amongst men and women\xe2\x80\x94the companion\r\nwho is never obtrusive or noisy from uneasy vanity or excessive animal\r\nspirits, and whose brow is never contracted by resentment or\r\nindignation. He showed no other change from the two months and more\r\nthat had passed since his first appearance in the weather-stained tunic\r\nand hose, than that added radiance of good fortune, which is like the\r\njust perceptible perfecting of a flower after it has drunk a morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsunbeams. Close behind him, ensconced in the narrow angle between his\r\nchair and the window-frame, stood the slim figure of Nello in holiday\r\nsuit, and at his left the younger Cennini\xe2\x80\x94Pietro, the erudite corrector\r\nof proof-sheets, not Domenico the practical. Tito was looking\r\nalternately down on the scene below, and upward at the varied knot of\r\ngazers and talkers immediately around him, some of whom had come in\r\nafter witnessing the commencement of the procession in the Piazza della\r\nSignoria. Piero di Cosimo was raising a laugh among them by his\r\ngrimaces and anathemas at the noise of the bells, against which no kind\r\nof ear-stuffing was a sufficient barricade, since the more he stuffed\r\nhis ears the more he felt the vibration of his skull; and declaring\r\nthat he would bury himself in the most solitary spot of the Valdarno on\r\na _festa_, if he were not condemned, as a painter, to lie in wait for\r\nthe secrets of colour that were sometimes to be caught from the\r\nfloating of banners and the chance grouping of the multitude.\r\n\r\nTito had just turned his laughing face away from the whimsical painter\r\nto look down at the small drama going on among the checkered border of\r\nspectators, when at the angle of the marble steps in front of the\r\nDuomo, nearly opposite Nello\xe2\x80\x99s shop, he saw a man\xe2\x80\x99s face upturned\r\ntowards him, and fixing on him a gaze that seemed to have more meaning\r\nin it than the ordinary passing observation of a stranger. It was a\r\nface with tonsured head, that rose above the black mantle and white\r\ntunic of a Dominican friar\xe2\x80\x94a very common sight in Florence; but the\r\nglance had something peculiar in it for Tito. There was a faint\r\nsuggestion in it, certainly not of an unpleasant kind. Yet what\r\npleasant association had he ever had with monks? None. The glance and\r\nthe suggestion hardly took longer than a flash of lightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNello!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, hastily, but immediately added, in a tone of\r\ndisappointment, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, he has turned round. It was that tall, thin friar\r\nwho is going up the steps. I wanted you to tell me if you knew aught of\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the Frati Predicatori,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, carelessly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect me to know the private history of the crows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seem to remember something about his face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an\r\nuncommon face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? you thought it might be our Fra Girolamo? Too tall; and he never\r\nshows himself in that chance way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, that loud-barking \xe2\x80\x98hound of the Lord\xe2\x80\x99[1] is not in Florence\r\njust now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesco Cei, the popular poet; \xe2\x80\x9che has taken Piero\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Medici\xe2\x80\x99s hint, to carry his railing prophecies on a journey for a\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] A play on the name of the Dominicans (_Domini Canes_) which was\r\n accepted by themselves, and which is pictorially represented in a\r\n fresco painted for them by Simone Memmi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Frate neither rails nor prophesies against any man,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nmiddle-aged personage seated at the other corner of the window; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nonly prophesies against vice. If you think that an attack on your\r\npoems, Francesco, it is not the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone into the Duomo now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, who had watched the\r\nfigure eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I was not under that mistake, Nello. Your Fra\r\nGirolamo has a high nose and a large under-lip. I saw him once\xe2\x80\x94he is\r\nnot handsome; but this man...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruce to your descriptions!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini. \xe2\x80\x9cHark! see! Here come the\r\nhorsemen and the banners. That standard,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, laying his hand\r\nfamiliarly on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat carried on the horse with white\r\ntrappings\xe2\x80\x94that with the red eagle holding the green dragon between his\r\ntalons, and the red lily over the eagle\xe2\x80\x94is the Gonfalon of the Guelf\r\nparty, and those cavaliers close round it are the chief officers of the\r\nGuelf party. That is one of our proudest banners, grumble as we may; it\r\nmeans the triumph of the Guelfs, which means the triumph of Florentine\r\nwill, which means triumph of the popolani.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, go on, Cennini,\xe2\x80\x9d said the middle-aged man, seated at the window,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich means triumph of the fat popolani over the lean, which again\r\nmeans triumph of the fattest popolano over those who are less fat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCronaca, you are becoming sententious,\xe2\x80\x9d said the printer; \xe2\x80\x9cFra\r\nGirolamo\xe2\x80\x99s preaching will spoil you, and make you take life by the\r\nwrong handle. Trust me, your cornices will lose half their beauty if\r\nyou begin to mingle bitterness with them; that is the _maniera Tedesca_\r\nwhich you used to declaim against when you came from Rome. The next\r\npalace you build we shall see you trying to put the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine\r\ninto stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a goodly show of cavaliers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, who had learned by\r\nthis time the best way to please Florentines; \xe2\x80\x9cbut are there not\r\nstrangers among them? I see foreign costumes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini; \xe2\x80\x9cyou see there the Orators from France,\r\nMilan, and Venice, and behind them are English and German nobles; for\r\nit is customary that all foreign visitors of distinction pay their\r\ntribute to San Giovanni in the train of that gonfalon. For my part, I\r\nthink our Florentine cavaliers sit their horses as well as any of those\r\ncut-and-thrust northerners, whose wits lie in their heels and saddles;\r\nand for yon Venetian, I fancy he would feel himself more at ease on the\r\nback of a dolphin. We ought to know something of horsemanship, for we\r\nexcel all Italy in the sports of the Giostra, and the money we spend on\r\nthem. But you will see a finer show of our chief men by-and-by, Melema;\r\nmy brother himself will be among the officers of the Zecca.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe banners are the better sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero di Cosimo, forgetting\r\nthe noise in his delight at the winding stream of colour as the\r\ntributary standards advanced round the piazza. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Florentine men are\r\nso-so; they make but a sorry show at this distance with their patch of\r\nsallow flesh-tint above the black garments; but those banners with\r\ntheir velvet, and satin, and minever, and brocade, and their endless\r\nplay of delicate light and shadow!\xe2\x80\x94_Va_! your human talk and doings are\r\na tame jest; the only passionate life is in form and colour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Piero, if Satanasso could paint, thou wouldst sell thy soul to\r\nlearn his secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is little likelihood of it,\r\nseeing the blessed angels themselves are such poor hands at\r\nchiaroscuro, if one may judge from their _capo-d\xe2\x80\x99opera_, the Madonna\r\nNunziata.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere go the banners of Pisa and Arezzo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, Messer\r\nPisano, it is no use for you to look sullen; you may as well carry your\r\nbanner to our San Giovanni with a good grace. \xe2\x80\x98Pisans false,\r\nFlorentines blind\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the second half of that proverb will hold no longer.\r\nThere come the ensigns of our subject towns and signories, Melema; they\r\nwill all be suspended in San Giovanni until this day next year, when\r\nthey will give place to new ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a fair sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; \xe2\x80\x9cand San Giovanni will surely be as\r\nwell satisfied with that produce of Italian looms as Minerva with her\r\npeplos, especially as he contents himself with so little drapery. But\r\nmy eyes are less delighted with those whirling towers, which would soon\r\nmake me fall from the window in sympathetic vertigo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ctowers\xe2\x80\x9d of which Tito spoke were a part of the procession esteemed\r\nvery glorious by the Florentine populace; and being perhaps chiefly a\r\nkind of hyperbole for the all-efficacious wax taper, were also called\r\n_ceri_. But inasmuch as hyperbole is impracticable in a real and\r\nliteral fashion, these gigantic _ceri_, some of them so large as to be\r\nof necessity carried on wheels, were not solid but hollow, and had\r\ntheir surface made not solely of wax, but of wood and pasteboard,\r\ngilded, carved, and painted, as real sacred tapers often are, with\r\nsuccessive circles of figures\xe2\x80\x94warriors on horseback, foot-soldiers with\r\nlance and shield, dancing maidens, animals, trees and fruits, and in\r\nfine, says the old chronicler, \xe2\x80\x9call things that could delight the eye\r\nand the heart;\xe2\x80\x9d the hollowness having the further advantage that men\r\ncould stand inside these hyperbolic tapers and whirl them continually,\r\nso as to produce a phantasmagoric effect, which, considering the towers\r\nwere numerous, must have been calculated to produce dizziness on a\r\ntruly magnificent scale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pestilenza_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero di Cosimo, moving from the window, \xe2\x80\x9cthose\r\nwhirling circles one above the other are worse than the jangling of all\r\nthe bells. Let me know when the last taper has passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, you will surely like to be called when the contadini come\r\ncarrying their torches,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello; \xe2\x80\x9cyou would not miss the\r\ncountry-folk of the Mugello and the Casentino, of whom your favourite\r\nLeonardo would make a hundred grotesque sketches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, resolutely, \xe2\x80\x9cI will see nothing till the car of the\r\nZecca comes. I have seen clowns enough holding tapers aslant, both with\r\nand without cowls, to last me for my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it comes, then, Piero\xe2\x80\x94the car of the Zecca,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Nello,\r\nafter an interval during which towers and tapers in a descending scale\r\nof size had been making their slow transit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Fediddio_!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Francesco Cei, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a well-tanned San\r\nGiovanni! some sturdy Romagnole beggar-man, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant. Our Signoria\r\nplays the host to all the Jewish and Christian scum that every other\r\ncity shuts its gates against, and lets them fatten on us like Saint\r\nAnthony\xe2\x80\x99s swine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe car of the Zecca or Mint, which had just rolled into sight, was\r\noriginally an immense wooden tower or _cero_ adorned after the same\r\nfashion as the other tributary _ceri_, mounted on a splendid car, and\r\ndrawn by two mouse-coloured oxen, whose mild heads looked out from rich\r\ntrappings bearing the arms of the Zecca. But the latter half of the\r\ncentury was getting rather ashamed of the towers with their circular or\r\nspiral paintings, which had delighted the eyes and the hearts of the\r\nother half, so that they had become a contemptuous proverb, and any\r\nill-painted figure looking, as will sometimes happen to figures in the\r\nbest ages of art, as if it had been boned for a pie, was called a\r\n_fantoccio da cero_, a tower-puppet; consequently improved taste, with\r\nCecca to help it, had devised for the magnificent Zecca a triumphal car\r\nlike a pyramidal catafalque, with ingenious wheels warranted to turn\r\nall corners easily. Round the base were living figures of saints and\r\nangels arrayed in sculpturesque fashion; and on the summit, at the\r\nheight of thirty feet, well bound to an iron rod and holding an iron\r\ncross also firmly infixed, stood a living representative of Saint John\r\nthe Baptist, with arms and legs bare, a garment of tiger-skins about\r\nhis body, and a golden nimbus fastened on his head\xe2\x80\x94as the Precursor was\r\nwont to appear in the cloisters and churches, not having yet revealed\r\nhimself to painters as the brown and sturdy boy who made one of the\r\nHoly Family. For where could the image of the patron saint be more\r\nfitly placed than on the symbol of the Zecca? Was not the royal\r\nprerogative of coining money the surest token that a city had won its\r\nindependence? and by the blessing of San Giovanni this \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\r\nsheepfold\xe2\x80\x9d of his had shown that token earliest among the Italian\r\ncities. Nevertheless, the annual function of representing the patron\r\nsaint was not among the high prizes of public life; it was paid for\r\nwith something like ten shillings, a cake weighing fourteen pounds, two\r\nbottles of wine, and a handsome supply of light eatables; the money\r\nbeing furnished by the magnificent Zecca, and the payment in kind being\r\nby peculiar \xe2\x80\x9cprivilege\xe2\x80\x9d presented in a basket suspended on a pole from\r\nan upper window of a private house, whereupon the eidolon of the\r\naustere saint at once invigorated himself with a reasonable share of\r\nthe sweets and wine, threw the remnants to the crowd, and embraced the\r\nmighty cake securely with his right arm through the remainder of his\r\npassage. This was the attitude in which the mimic San Giovanni\r\npresented himself as the tall car jerked and vibrated on its slow way\r\nround the piazza to the northern gate of the Baptistery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere go the Masters of the Zecca, and there is my brother\xe2\x80\x94you see\r\nhim, Melema?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cennini, with an agreeable stirring of pride at\r\nshowing a stranger what was too familiar to be remarkable to\r\nfellow-citizens. \xe2\x80\x9cBehind come the members of the Corporation of\r\nCalimara,[2] the dealers in foreign cloth, to which we have given our\r\nFlorentine finish; men of ripe years, you see, who were matriculated\r\nbefore you were born; and then comes the famous Art of Money-changers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [2] \xe2\x80\x9cArte di Calimara,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9carte\xe2\x80\x9d being, in this use of it, equivalent to\r\n corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany of them matriculated also to the noble art of usury before you\r\nwere born,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Francesco Cei, \xe2\x80\x9cas you may discern by a certain\r\nfitful glare of the eye and sharp curve of the nose which manifest\r\ntheir descent from the ancient Harpies, whose portraits you saw\r\nsupporting the arms of the Zecca. Shaking off old prejudices now, such\r\na procession as that of some four hundred passably ugly men carrying\r\ntheir tapers in open daylight, Diogenes-fashion, as if they were\r\nlooking for a lost quattrino, would make a merry spectacle for the\r\nFeast of Fools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlaspheme not against the usages of our city,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pietro Cennini,\r\nmuch offended. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are new wits who think they see things more truly\r\nbecause they stand on their heads to look at them, like tumblers and\r\nmountebanks, instead of keeping the attitude of rational men. Doubtless\r\nit makes little difference to Maestro Vaiano\xe2\x80\x99s monkeys whether they see\r\nour Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s statue of Judith with their heads or their tails\r\nuppermost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour solemnity will allow some quarter to playful fancy, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCei, with a shrug, \xe2\x80\x9celse what becomes of the ancients, whose example\r\nyou scholars are bound to revere, Messer Pietro? Life was never\r\nanything but a perpetual see-saw between gravity and jest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your jest then till your end of the pole is uppermost,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCennini, still angry, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is not when the great bond of our\r\nRepublic is expressing itself in ancient symbols, without which the\r\nvulgar would be conscious of nothing beyond their own petty wants of\r\nback and stomach, and never rise to the sense of community in religion\r\nand law. There has been no great people without processions, and the\r\nman who thinks himself too wise to be moved by them to anything but\r\ncontempt, is like the puddle that was proud of standing alone while the\r\nriver rushed by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one said anything after this indignant burst of Cennini\xe2\x80\x99s till he\r\nhimself spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark! the trumpets of the Signoria: now comes the last stage of the\r\nshow, Melema. That is our Gonfaloniere in the middle, in the starred\r\nmantle, with the sword carried before him. Twenty years ago we used to\r\nsee our foreign Podesta, who was our judge in civil causes, walking on\r\nhis right-hand; but our Republic has been over-doctored by clever\r\n_Medici_. That is the Proposto (Spokesman or Moderator) of the Priori\r\non the left; then come the other seven Priori; then all the other\r\nmagistracies and officials of our Republic. You see your patron the\r\nSegretario?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is Messer Bernardo del Nero also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; \xe2\x80\x9chis visage is a\r\nfine and venerable one, though it has worn rather a petrifying look\r\ntowards me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, \xe2\x80\x9che is the dragon that guards the remnant of old\r\nBardo\xe2\x80\x99s gold, which, I fancy, is chiefly that virgin gold that falls\r\nabout the fair Romola\xe2\x80\x99s head and shoulders; eh, my Apollino?\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\npatting Tito\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nTito had the youthful grace of blushing, but he had also the adroit and\r\nready speech that prevents a blush from looking like embarrassment. He\r\nreplied at once\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very Pactolus it is\xe2\x80\x94a stream with golden ripples. If I were an\r\nalchemist\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was saved from the need for further speech by the sudden fortissimo\r\nof drums and trumpets and fifes, bursting into the breadth of the\r\npiazza in a grand storm of sound\xe2\x80\x94a roar, a blast, and a whistling, well\r\nbefitting a city famous for its musical instruments, and reducing the\r\nmembers of the closest group to a state of deaf isolation.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval Nello observed Tito\xe2\x80\x99s fingers moving in\r\nrecognition of some one in the crowd below, but not seeing the\r\ndirection of his glance he failed to detect the object of this\r\ngreeting\xe2\x80\x94the sweet round blue-eyed face under a white hood\xe2\x80\x94immediately\r\nlost in the narrow border of heads, where there was a continual eclipse\r\nof round contadina cheeks by the harsh-lined features or bent shoulders\r\nof an old spadesman, and where profiles turned as sharply from north to\r\nsouth as weathercocks under a shifting wind.\r\n\r\nBut when it was felt that the show was ended\xe2\x80\x94when the twelve prisoners\r\nreleased in honour of the day, and the very _barberi_ or race-horses,\r\nwith the arms of their owners embroidered on their cloths, had followed\r\nup the Signoria, and been duly consecrated to San Giovanni, and every\r\none was moving from the window\xe2\x80\x94Nello, whose Florentine curiosity was of\r\nthat lively canine sort which thinks no trifle too despicable for\r\ninvestigation, put his hand on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat acquaintance was that you were making signals to, eh, _giovane\r\nmio_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome little contadina who probably mistook me for an acquaintance, for\r\nshe had honoured me with a greeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr who wished to begin an acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are\r\nbound for the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi and the feast of the Muses: there is no\r\ncounting on you for a frolic, else we might have gone in search of\r\nadventures together in the crowd, and had some pleasant fooling in\r\nhonour of San Giovanni. But your high fortune has come on you too soon:\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the professor\xe2\x80\x99s mantle\xe2\x80\x94_that_ is roomy enough to hide a\r\nfew stolen chickens, but\xe2\x80\x94 Messer Endymion minded his manners after that\r\nsingular good fortune of his; and what says our Luigi Pulci?\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Da quel giorno in qua ch\xe2\x80\x99amor m\xe2\x80\x99accese\r\nPer lei son fatto e gentile e cortese.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNello, _amico mio_, thou hast an intolerable trick of making life\r\nstale by forestalling it with thy talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, shrugging his\r\nshoulders, with a look of patient resignation, which was his nearest\r\napproach to anger: \xe2\x80\x9cnot to mention that such ill-founded babbling would\r\nbe held a great offence by that same goddess whose humble worshipper\r\nyou are always professing yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be mute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, laying his finger on his lips, with a\r\nresponding shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is only under our four eyes that I talk any\r\nfolly about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon! you were on the verge of it just now in the hearing of others.\r\nIf you want to ruin me in the minds of Bardo and his daughter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, enough!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cI am an absurd old barber. It all comes\r\nfrom that abstinence of mine, in not making bad verses in my youth: for\r\nwant of letting my folly run out that way when I was eighteen, it runs\r\nout at my tongue\xe2\x80\x99s end now I am at the unseemly age of fifty. But Nello\r\nhas not got his head muffled for all that; he can see a buffalo in the\r\nsnow. _Addio, giovane mio_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nA Man\xe2\x80\x99s Ransom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTito was soon down among the crowd, and, notwithstanding his\r\nindifferent reply to Nello\xe2\x80\x99s question about his chance acquaintance, he\r\nwas not without a passing wish, as he made his way round the piazza to\r\nthe Corso degli Adimari, that he might encounter the pair of blue eyes\r\nwhich had looked up towards him from under the square bit of white\r\nlinen drapery that formed the ordinary hood of the contadina at festa\r\ntime. He was perfectly well aware that that face was Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s; but he\r\nhad not chosen to say so. What had Nello to do with the matter? Tito\r\nhad an innate love of reticence\xe2\x80\x94let us say a talent for it\xe2\x80\x94which acted\r\nas other impulses do, without any conscious motive, and, like all\r\npeople to whom concealment is easy, he would now and then conceal\r\nsomething which had as little the nature of a secret as the fact that\r\nhe had seen a flight of crows.\r\n\r\nBut the passing wish about pretty Tessa was almost immediately eclipsed\r\nby the recurrent recollection of that friar whose face had some\r\nirrecoverable association for him. Why should a sickly fanatic, worn\r\nwith fasting, have looked at _him_ in particular, and where in all his\r\ntravels could he remember encountering that face before? Folly! such\r\nvague memories hang about the mind like cobwebs, with tickling\r\nimportunity\xe2\x80\x94best to sweep them away at a dash: and Tito had pleasanter\r\noccupation for his thoughts. By the time he was turning out of the\r\nCorso degli Adimari into a side-street he was caring only that the sun\r\nwas high, and that the procession had kept him longer than he had\r\nintended from his visit to that room in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, where his\r\ncoming, he knew, was anxiously awaited. He felt the scene of his\r\nentrance beforehand: the joy beaming diffusedly in the blind face like\r\nthe light in a semi-transparent lamp; the transient pink flush on\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s face and neck, which subtracted nothing from her majesty, but\r\nonly gave it the exquisite charm of womanly sensitiveness, heightened\r\nstill more by what seemed the paradoxical boy-like frankness of her\r\nlook and smile. They were the best comrades in the world during the\r\nhours they passed together round the blind man\xe2\x80\x99s chair: she was\r\nconstantly appealing to Tito, and he was informing her, yet he felt\r\nhimself strangely in subjection to Romola with that simplicity of hers:\r\nhe felt for the first time, without defining it to himself, that loving\r\nawe in the presence of noble womanhood, which is perhaps something like\r\nthe worship paid of old to a great nature-goddess, who was not\r\nall-knowing, but whose life and power were something deeper and more\r\nprimordial than knowledge. They had never been alone together, and he\r\ncould frame to himself no probable image of love-scenes between them:\r\nhe could only fancy and wish wildly\xe2\x80\x94what he knew was impossible\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nRomola would some day tell him that she loved him. One day in Greece,\r\nas he was leaning over a wall in the sunshine, a little black-eyed\r\npeasant girl, who had rested her water-pot on the wall, crept gradually\r\nnearer and nearer to him, and at last shyly asked him to kiss her,\r\nputting up her round olive cheek very innocently. Tito was used to love\r\nthat came in this unsought fashion. But Romola\xe2\x80\x99s love would never come\r\nin that way: would it ever come at all?\xe2\x80\x94and yet it was that topmost\r\napple on which he had set his mind. He was in his fresh youth\xe2\x80\x94not\r\npassionate, but impressible: it was as inevitable that he should feel\r\nlovingly towards Romola as that the white irises should be reflected in\r\nthe clear sunlit stream; but he had no coxcombry, and he had an\r\nintimate sense that Romola was something very much above him. Many men\r\nhave felt the same before a large-eyed, simple child.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Tito had had the rapid success which would have made some\r\nmen presuming, or would have warranted him in thinking that there would\r\nbe no great presumption in entertaining an agreeable confidence that he\r\nmight one day be the husband of Romola\xe2\x80\x94nay, that her father himself was\r\nnot without a vision of such a future for him. His first auspicious\r\ninterview with Bartolommeo Scala had proved the commencement of a\r\ngrowing favour on the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s part, and had led to an issue which\r\nwould have been enough to make Tito decide on Florence as the place in\r\nwhich to establish himself, even if it had held no other magnet.\r\nPolitian was professor of Greek as well as Latin at Florence,\r\nprofessorial chairs being maintained there, although the university had\r\nbeen removed to Pisa; but for a long time Demetrio Calcondila, one of\r\nthe most eminent and respectable among the emigrant Greeks, had also\r\nheld a Greek chair, simultaneously with the too predominant Italian.\r\nCalcondila was now gone to Milan, and there was no counterpoise or\r\nrival to Politian such as was desired for him by the friends who wished\r\nhim to be taught a little propriety and humility. Scala was far from\r\nbeing the only friend of this class, and he found several who, if they\r\nwere not among those thirsty admirers of mediocrity that were glad to\r\nbe refreshed with his verses in hot weather, were yet quite willing to\r\njoin him in doing that moral service to Politian. It was finally agreed\r\nthat Tito should be supported in a Greek chair, as Demetrio Calcondila\r\nhad been by Lorenzo himself, who, being at the same time the\r\naffectionate patron of Politian, had shown by precedent that there was\r\nnothing invidious in such a measure, but only a zeal for true learning\r\nand for the instruction of the Florentine youth.\r\n\r\nTito was thus sailing under the fairest breeze, and besides convincing\r\nfair judges that his talents squared with his good fortune, he wore\r\nthat fortune so easily and unpretentiously that no one had yet been\r\noffended by it. He was not unlikely to get into the best Florentine\r\nsociety: society where there was much more plate than the circle of\r\nenamelled silver in the centre of the brass dishes, and where it was\r\nnot forbidden by the Signory to wear the richest brocade. For where\r\ncould a handsome young scholar not be welcome when he could touch the\r\nlute and troll a gay song? That bright face, that easy smile, that\r\nliquid voice, seemed to give life a holiday aspect; just as a strain of\r\ngay music and the hoisting of colours make the work-worn and the sad\r\nrather ashamed of showing themselves. Here was a professor likely to\r\nrender the Greek classics amiable to the sons of great houses.\r\n\r\nAnd that was not the whole of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune; for he had sold all\r\nhis jewels, except the ring he did not choose to part with, and he was\r\nmaster of full five hundred gold florins.\r\n\r\nYet the moment when he first had this sum in his possession was the\r\ncrisis of the first serious struggle his facile, good-humoured nature\r\nhad known. An importunate thought, of which he had till now refused to\r\nsee more than the shadow as it dogged his footsteps, at last rushed\r\nupon him and grasped him: he was obliged to pause and decide whether he\r\nwould surrender and obey, or whether he would give the refusal that\r\nmust carry irrevocable consequences. It was in the room above Nello\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop, which Tito had now hired as a lodging, that the elder Cennini\r\nhanded him the last quota of the sum on behalf of Bernardo Rucellai,\r\nthe purchaser of the two most valuable gems.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ecco, giovane mio_!\xe2\x80\x9d said the respectable printer and goldsmith, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhave now a pretty little fortune; and if you will take my advice, you\r\nwill let me place your florins in a safe quarter, where they may\r\nincrease and multiply, instead of slipping through your fingers for\r\nbanquets and other follies which are rife among our Florentine youth.\r\nAnd it has been too much the fashion of scholars, especially when, like\r\nour Pietro Crinito, they think their scholarship needs to be scented\r\nand broidered, to squander with one hand till they have been fain to\r\nbeg with the other. I have brought you the money, and you are free to\r\nmake a wise choice or an unwise: I shall see on which side the balance\r\ndips. We Florentines hold no man a member of an Art till he has shown\r\nhis skill and been matriculated; and no man is matriculated to the art\r\nof life till he has been well tempted. If you make up your mind to put\r\nyour florins out to usury, you can let me know to-morrow. A scholar may\r\nmarry, and should have something in readiness for the _morgen-cap.\r\nAddio_.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1] A sum given by the bridegroom to the bride the day after the\r\n marriage. _Morgengabe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Cennini closed the door behind him, Tito turned round with the smile\r\ndying out of his face, and fixed his eyes on the table where the\r\nflorins lay. He made no other movement, but stood with his thumbs in\r\nhis belt, looking down, in that transfixed state which accompanies the\r\nconcentration of consciousness on some inward image.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man\xe2\x80\x99s ransom!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94who was it that had said five hundred florins was\r\nmore than a man\xe2\x80\x99s ransom? If now, under this mid-day sun, on some hot\r\ncoast far away, a man somewhat stricken in years\xe2\x80\x94a man not without high\r\nthoughts and with the most passionate heart\xe2\x80\x94a man who long years ago\r\nhad rescued a little boy from a life of beggary, filth, and cruel\r\nwrong, had reared him tenderly, and been to him as a father\xe2\x80\x94if that man\r\n_were_ now under this summer sun toiling as a slave, hewing wood and\r\ndrawing water, perhaps being smitten and buffeted because he was not\r\ndeft and active? If he were saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cTito will find me: he\r\nhad but to carry our manuscripts and gems to Venice; he will have\r\nraised money, and will never rest till he finds me out\xe2\x80\x9d? If that were\r\ncertain, could he, Tito, see the price of the gems lying before him,\r\nand say, \xe2\x80\x9cI will stay at Florence, where I am fanned by soft airs of\r\npromised love and prosperity; I will not risk myself for his sake\xe2\x80\x9d? No,\r\nsurely not, _if it were certain_. But nothing could be farther from\r\ncertainty. The galley had been taken by a Turkish vessel on its way to\r\nDelos: _that_ was known by the report of the companion galley, which\r\nhad escaped. But there had been resistance, and probable bloodshed; a\r\nman had been seen falling overboard: who were the survivors, and what\r\nhad befallen them amongst all the multitude of possibilities? Had not\r\nhe, Tito, suffered shipwreck, and narrowly escaped drowning? He had\r\ngood cause for feeling the omnipresence of casualties that threatened\r\nall projects with futility. The rumour that there were pirates who had\r\na settlement in Delos was not to be depended on, or might be nothing to\r\nthe purpose. What, probably enough, would be the result if he were to\r\nquit Florence and go to Venice; get authoritative letters\xe2\x80\x94yes, he knew\r\nthat might be done\xe2\x80\x94and set out for the Archipelago? Why, that he should\r\nbe himself seized, and spend all his florins on preliminaries, and be\r\nagain a destitute wanderer\xe2\x80\x94with no more gems to sell.\r\n\r\nTito had a clearer vision of that result than of the possible moment\r\nwhen he might find his father again, and carry him deliverance. It\r\nwould surely be an unfairness that he, in his full ripe youth, to whom\r\nlife had hitherto had some of the stint and subjection of a school,\r\nshould turn his back on promised love and distinction, and perhaps\r\nnever be visited by that promise again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I were certain that Baldassarre Calvo was alive, and that I could\r\nfree him, by whatever exertions or perils, I would go now\xe2\x80\x94now I have\r\nthe money: it was useless to debate the matter before. I would go now\r\nto Bardo and Bartolommeo Scala, and tell them the whole truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Tito\r\ndid not say to himself so distinctly that if those two men had known\r\nthe whole truth he was aware there would have been no alternative for\r\nhim but to go in search of his benefactor, who, if alive, was the\r\nrightful owner of the gems, and whom he had always equivocally spoken\r\nof as \xe2\x80\x9clost;\xe2\x80\x9d he did not say to himself\xe2\x80\x94what he was not ignorant\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94that Greeks of distinction had made sacrifices, taken voyages again\r\nand again, and sought help from crowned and mitred heads for the sake\r\nof freeing relatives from slavery to the Turks. Public opinion did not\r\nregard this as exceptional virtue.\r\n\r\nThis was his first real colloquy with himself: he had gone on following\r\nthe impulses of the moment, and one of those impulses had been to\r\nconceal half the fact; he had never considered this part of his conduct\r\nlong enough to face the consciousness of his motives for the\r\nconcealment. What was the use of telling the whole? It was true, the\r\nthought had crossed his mind several times since he had quitted Nauplia\r\nthat, after all, it was a great relief to be quit of Baldassarre, and\r\nhe would have liked to know _who_ it was that had fallen overboard. But\r\nsuch thoughts spring inevitably out of a relation that is irksome.\r\nBaldassarre was exacting, and had got stranger as he got older: he was\r\nconstantly scrutinising Tito\xe2\x80\x99s mind to see whether it answered to his\r\nown exaggerated expectations; and age\xe2\x80\x94the age of a thickset,\r\nheavy-browed, bald man beyond sixty, whose intensity and eagerness in\r\nthe grasp of ideas have long taken the character of monotony and\r\nrepetition, may be looked at from many points of view without being\r\nfound attractive. Such a man, stranded among new acquaintances, unless\r\nhe had the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s stone, would hardly find rank, youth, and\r\nbeauty at his feet. The feelings that gather fervour from novelty will\r\nbe of little help towards making the world a home for dimmed and faded\r\nhuman beings; and if there is any love of which they are not widowed,\r\nit must be the love that is rooted in memories and distils perpetually\r\nthe sweet balms of fidelity and forbearing tenderness.\r\n\r\nBut surely such memories were not absent from Tito\xe2\x80\x99s mind? Far in the\r\nbackward vista of his remembered life, when he was only seven years\r\nold, Baldassarre had rescued him from blows, had taken him to a home\r\nthat seemed like opened paradise, where there was sweet food and\r\nsoothing caresses, all had on Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s knee; and from that time\r\ntill the hour they had parted, Tito had been the one centre of\r\nBaldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s fatherly cares.\r\n\r\nAnd he had been docile, pliable, quick of apprehension, ready to\r\nacquire: a very bright lovely boy, a youth of even splendid grace, who\r\nseemed quite without vices, as if that beautiful form represented a\r\nvitality so exquisitely poised and balanced that it could know no\r\nuneasy desires, no unrest\xe2\x80\x94a radiant presence for a lonely man to have\r\nwon for himself. If he were silent when his father expected some\r\nresponse, still he did not look moody; if he declined some labour\xe2\x80\x94why,\r\nhe flung himself down with such a charming, half-smiling, half-pleading\r\nair, that the pleasure of looking at him made amends to one who had\r\nwatched his growth with a sense of claim and possession: the curves of\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s mouth had ineffable good-humour in them. And then, the quick\r\ntalent to which everything came readily, from philosophical systems to\r\nthe rhymes of a street ballad caught up at a hearing! Would any one\r\nhave said that Tito had not made a rich return to his benefactor, or\r\nthat his gratitude and affection would fail on any great demand?\r\n\r\nHe did not admit that his gratitude had failed; but _it was not\r\ncertain_ that Baldassarre was in slavery, not certain that he was\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I not owe something to myself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, inwardly, with a slight\r\nmovement of his shoulders, the first he had made since he had turned to\r\nlook down at the florins. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I quit everything, and incur again\r\nall the risks of which I am even now weary, I must at least have a\r\nreasonable hope. Am I to spend my life in a wandering search? _I\r\nbelieve he is dead_. Cennini was right about my florins: I will place\r\nthem in his hands to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen, the next morning, Tito put this determination into act he had\r\nchosen his colour in the game, and had given an inevitable bent to his\r\nwishes. He had made it impossible that he should not from henceforth\r\ndesire it to be the truth that his father was dead; impossible that he\r\nshould not be tempted to baseness rather than that the precise facts of\r\nhis conduct should not remain for ever concealed.\r\n\r\nUnder every guilty secret there is hidden a brood of guilty wishes,\r\nwhose unwholesome infecting life is cherished by the darkness. The\r\ncontaminating effect of deeds often lies less in the commission than in\r\nthe consequent adjustment of our desires\xe2\x80\x94the enlistment of our\r\nself-interest on the side of falsity; as, on the other hand, the\r\npurifying influence of public confession springs from the fact, that by\r\nit the hope in lies is for ever swept away, and the soul recovers the\r\nnoble attitude of simplicity.\r\n\r\nBesides, in this first distinct colloquy with himself the ideas which\r\nhad previously been scattered and interrupted had now concentrated\r\nthemselves; the little rills of selfishness had united and made a\r\nchannel, so that they could never again meet with the same resistance.\r\nHitherto Tito had left in vague indecision the question whether, with\r\nthe means in his power, he would not return, and ascertain his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfate; he had now made a definite excuse to himself for not taking that\r\ncourse; he had avowed to himself a choice which he would have been\r\nashamed to avow to others, and which would have made him ashamed in the\r\nresurgent presence of his father. But the inward shame, the reflex of\r\nthat outward law which the great heart of mankind makes for every\r\nindividual man, a reflex which will exist even in the absence of the\r\nsympathetic impulses that need no law, but rush to the deed of fidelity\r\nand pity as inevitably as the brute mother shields her young from the\r\nattack of the hereditary enemy\xe2\x80\x94that inward shame was showing its\r\nblushes in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s determined assertion to himself that his father was\r\ndead, or that at least search was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nUnder the Plane-Tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day of San Giovanni it was already three weeks ago that Tito had\r\nhanded his florins to Cennini, and we have seen that as he set out\r\ntowards the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi he showed all the outward signs of a mind at\r\nease. How should it be otherwise? He never jarred with what was\r\nimmediately around him, and his nature was too joyous, too\r\nunapprehensive, for the hidden and the distant to grasp him in the\r\nshape of a dread. As he turned out of the hot sunshine into the shelter\r\nof a narrow street, took off the black cloth berretta, or simple cap\r\nwith upturned lappet, which just crowned his brown curls, pushing his\r\nhair and tossing his head backward to court the cooler air, there was\r\nno brand of duplicity on his brow; neither was there any stamp of\r\ncandour: it was simply a finely-formed, square, smooth young brow. And\r\nthe slow absent glance he cast around at the upper windows of the\r\nhouses had neither more dissimulation in it, nor more ingenuousness,\r\nthan belongs to a youthful well-opened eyelid with its unwearied\r\nbreadth of gaze; to perfectly pellucid lenses; to the undimmed dark of\r\na rich brown iris; and to a pure cerulean-tinted angle of whiteness\r\nstreaked with the delicate shadows of long eyelashes. Was it that\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s face attracted or repelled according to the mental attitude of\r\nthe observer? Was it a cypher with more than one key? The strong,\r\nunmistakable expression in his whole air and person was a negative one,\r\nand it was perfectly veracious; it declared the absence of any uneasy\r\nclaim, any restless vanity, and it made the admiration that followed\r\nhim as he passed among the troop of holiday-makers a thoroughly willing\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\nFor by this time the stir of the Festa was felt even in the narrowest\r\nside-streets; the throng which had at one time been concentrated in the\r\nlines through which the procession had to pass, was now streaming out\r\nin all directions in pursuit of a new object. Such intervals of a Festa\r\nare precisely the moments when the vaguely active animal spirits of a\r\ncrowd are likely to be the most petulant and most ready to sacrifice a\r\nstray individual to the greater happiness of the greater number. As\r\nTito entered the neighbourhood of San Martino, he found the throng\r\nrather denser; and near the hostelry of the _Bertucce_, or Baboons,\r\nthere was evidently some object which was arresting the passengers and\r\nforming them into a knot. It needed nothing of great interest to draw\r\naside passengers unfreighted with a purpose, and Tito was preparing to\r\nturn aside into an adjoining street, when, amidst the loud laughter,\r\nhis ear discerned a distressed childish voice crying, \xe2\x80\x9cLoose me! Holy\r\nVirgin, help me!\xe2\x80\x9d which at once determined him to push his way into the\r\nknot of gazers. He had just had time to perceive that the distressed\r\nvoice came from a young contadina, whose white hood had fallen off in\r\nthe struggle to get her hands free from the grasp of a man in the\r\nparti-coloured dress of a _cerretano_, or conjuror, who was making\r\nlaughing attempts to soothe and cajole her, evidently carrying with him\r\nthe amused sympathy of the spectators. These, by a persuasive variety\r\nof words signifying simpleton, for which the Florentine dialect is rich\r\nin equivalents, seemed to be arguing with the contadina against her\r\nobstinacy. At the first moment the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face was turned away, and he\r\nsaw only her light-brown hair plaited and fastened with a long silver\r\npin; but in the next, the struggle brought her face opposite Tito\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand he saw the baby features of Tessa, her blue eyes filled with tears,\r\nand her under-lip quivering. Tessa, too, saw _him_, and through the\r\nmist of her swelling tears there beamed a sudden hope, like that in the\r\nface of a little child, when, held by a stranger against its will, it\r\nsees a familiar hand stretched out.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Tito had pushed his way through the barrier of\r\nbystanders, whose curiosity made them ready to turn aside at the sudden\r\ninterference of this handsome young signor, had grasped Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s waist,\r\nand had said, \xe2\x80\x9cLoose this child! What right have you to hold her\r\nagainst her will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conjuror\xe2\x80\x94a man with one of those faces in which the angles of the\r\neyes and eyebrows, of the nostrils, mouth, and sharply-defined jaw, all\r\ntend upward\xe2\x80\x94showed his small regular teeth in an impish but not\r\nill-natured grin, as he let go Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and stretched out his own\r\nbackward, shrugging his shoulders, and bending them forward a little in\r\na half-apologetic, half-protesting manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean the ragazza no evil in the world, Messere: ask this respectable\r\ncompany. I was only going to show them a few samples of my skill, in\r\nwhich this little damsel might have helped me the better because of her\r\nkitten face, which would have assured them of open dealing; and I had\r\npromised her a lapful of confetti as a reward. But what then? Messer\r\nhas doubtless better confetti at hand, and she knows it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA general laugh among the bystanders accompanied these last words of\r\nthe conjuror, raised, probably, by the look of relief and confidence\r\nwith which Tessa clung to Tito\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as he drew it from her waist, and\r\nplaced her hand within it. She only cared about the laugh as she might\r\nhave cared about the roar of wild beasts from which she was escaping,\r\nnot attaching any meaning to it; but Tito, who had no sooner got her on\r\nhis arm than he foresaw some embarrassment in the situation, hastened\r\nto get clear of observers who, having been despoiled of an expected\r\namusement, were sure to re-establish the balance by jests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, see, little one! here is your hood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the conjuror, throwing\r\nthe bit of white drapery over Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9c_Ors\xc3\xb9_, bear me no malice;\r\ncome back to me when Messere can spare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Maestro Vaiano, she\xe2\x80\x99ll come back presently, as the toad said to\r\nthe harrow,\xe2\x80\x9d called out one of the spectators, seeing how Tessa started\r\nand shrank at the action of the conjuror.\r\n\r\nTito pushed his way vigorously towards the corner of a side-street, a\r\nlittle vexed at this delay in his progress to the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and\r\nintending to get rid of the poor little contadina as soon as possible.\r\nThe next street, too, had its passengers inclined to make holiday\r\nremarks on so unusual a pair; but they had no sooner entered it than he\r\nsaid, in a kind but hurried manner, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, little one, where were you\r\ngoing? Are you come by yourself to the Festa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, looking frightened and distressed again; \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nlost my mother in the crowd\xe2\x80\x94her and my father-in-law. They will be\r\nangry\xe2\x80\x94he will beat me. It was in the crowd in San Pulinari\xe2\x80\x94somebody\r\npushed me along and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop myself, so I got away from them.\r\nOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where they\xe2\x80\x99re gone! Please, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes had been swelling with tears again, and she ended with a sob.\r\n\r\nTito hurried along again: the Church of the Badia was not far off. They\r\ncould enter it by the cloister that opened at the back, and in the\r\nchurch he could talk to Tessa\xe2\x80\x94perhaps leave her. No! it was an hour at\r\nwhich the church was not open; but they paused under the shelter of the\r\ncloister, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no cousin or friend in Florence, my\r\nlittle Tessa, whose house you could find; or are you afraid of walking\r\nby yourself since you have been frightened by the conjuror? I am in a\r\nhurry to get to Oltrarno, but if I could take you anywhere near\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _am_ frightened: he was the devil\xe2\x80\x94I know he was. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow where to go. I have nobody: and my mother meant to have her dinner\r\nsomewhere, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where. Holy Madonna! I shall be beaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe corners of the pouting mouth went down piteously, and the poor\r\nlittle bosom with the beads on it above the green serge gown heaved so,\r\nthat there was no longer any help for it: a loud sob _would_ come, and\r\nthe big tears fell as if they were making up for lost time. Here was a\r\nsituation! It would have been brutal to leave her, and Tito\xe2\x80\x99s nature\r\nwas all gentleness. He wished at that moment that he had not been\r\nexpected in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi. As he saw her lifting up her holiday\r\napron to catch the hurrying tears, he laid his hand, too, on the apron,\r\nand rubbed one of the cheeks and kissed the baby-like roundness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor little Tessa! leave off crying. Let us see what can be done.\r\nWhere is your home\xe2\x80\x94where do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, but the sobs began to subside a little and the\r\ndrops to fall less quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you a little way, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me where you want to\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe apron fell, and Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s face began to look as contented as a\r\ncherub\xe2\x80\x99s budding from a cloud. The diabolical conjuror, the anger and\r\nthe beating, seemed a long way off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a half whisper,\r\nlooking up at Tito with wide blue eyes, and with something sweeter than\r\na smile\xe2\x80\x94with a childlike calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, in a caressing tone, putting her\r\narm within his again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich way is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeyond Peretola\xe2\x80\x94where the large pear-tree is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeretola? Out at which gate, pazzarella? I am a stranger, you must\r\nremember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut at the Por del Prato,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, moving along with a very fast\r\nhold on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\nHe did not know all the turnings well enough to venture on an attempt\r\nat choosing the quietest streets; and besides, it occurred to him that\r\nwhere the passengers were most numerous there was, perhaps, the most\r\nchance of meeting with Monna Ghita and finding an end to his\r\nknight-errant-ship. So he made straight for Porta Rossa, and on to\r\nOgnissanti, showing his usual bright propitiatory face to the mixed\r\nobservers who threw their jests at him and his little heavy-shod maiden\r\nwith much liberality. Mingled with the more decent holiday-makers there\r\nwere frolicsome apprentices, rather envious of his good fortune;\r\nbold-eyed women with the badge of the yellow veil; beggars who thrust\r\nforward their caps for alms, in derision at Tito\xe2\x80\x99s evident haste;\r\ndicers, sharpers, and loungers of the worst sort; boys whose tongues\r\nwere used to wag in concert at the most brutal street games: for the\r\nstreets of Florence were not always a moral spectacle in those times,\r\nand Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s terror at being lost in the crowd was not wholly\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Piazza d\xe2\x80\x99Ognissanti, Tito slackened his pace:\r\nthey were both heated with their hurried walk, and here was a wider\r\nspace where they could take breath. They sat down on one of the stone\r\nbenches which were frequent against the walls of old Florentine houses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa; \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad we have got away from those women\r\nand boys; but I was not frightened, because you could take care of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty little Tessa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, smiling at her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you feel\r\nso safe with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are so beautiful\xe2\x80\x94like the people going into Paradise: they\r\nare all good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long while since you had your breakfast, Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito,\r\nseeing some stalls near, with fruit and sweetmeats upon them. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nhungry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I am\xe2\x80\x94if you will have some too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito bought some apricots, and cakes, and comfits, and put them into\r\nher apron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us walk on to the Prato, and then perhaps you\r\nwill not be afraid to go the rest of the way alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will have some of the apricots and things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, rising\r\nobediently and gathering up her apron as a bag for her store.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito aloud; and to himself he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a\r\nlittle contadina who might inspire a better idyl than Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMedici\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Nencia da Barberino,\xe2\x80\x99 that Nello\xe2\x80\x99s friends rave about; if I\r\nwere only a Theocritus, or had time to cultivate the necessary\r\nexperience by unseasonable walks of this sort! However, the mischief is\r\ndone now: I am so late already that another half-hour will make no\r\ndifference. Pretty little pigeon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a garden and plenty of pears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, \xe2\x80\x9cand two cows,\r\nbesides the mules; and I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of them. But my father-in-law is a\r\ncross man: I wish my mother had not married him. I think he is wicked;\r\nhe is very ugly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does your mother let him beat you, poverina? You said you were\r\nafraid of being beaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my mother herself scolds me: she loves my young sister better, and\r\nthinks I don\xe2\x80\x99t do work enough. Nobody speaks kindly to me, only the\r\nPievano (parish priest) when I go to confession. And the men in the\r\nMercato laugh at me and make fun of me. Nobody ever kissed me and spoke\r\nto me as you do; just as I talk to my little black-faced kid, because\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed not to have entered Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s mind that there was any change in\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s appearance since the morning he begged the milk from her, and\r\nthat he looked now like a personage for whom she must summon her little\r\nstock of reverent words and signs. He had impressed her too differently\r\nfrom any human being who had ever come near her before, for her to make\r\nany comparison of details; she took no note of his dress; he was simply\r\na voice and a face to her, something come from Paradise into a world\r\nwhere most things seemed hard and angry; and she prattled with as\r\nlittle restraint as if he had been an imaginary companion born of her\r\nown lovingness and the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the Prato, which at that time was a large open\r\nspace within the walls, where the Florentine youth played at their\r\nfavourite _Calcio_\xe2\x80\x94a peculiar kind of football\xe2\x80\x94and otherwise exercised\r\nthemselves. At this mid-day time it was forsaken and quiet to the very\r\ngates, where a tent had been erected in preparation for the race. On\r\nthe border of this wide meadow, Tito paused and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Tessa, you will not be frightened if I leave you to walk the rest\r\nof the way by yourself. Addio! Shall I come and buy a cup of milk from\r\nyou in the Mercato to-morrow morning, to see that you are quite safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe added this question in a soothing tone, as he saw her eyes widening\r\nsorrowfully, and the corners of her mouth falling. She said nothing at\r\nfirst; she only opened her apron and looked down at her apricots and\r\nsweetmeats. Then she looked up at him again and said complainingly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would have some, and we could sit down under a tree\r\noutside the gate, and eat them together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa, Tessa, you little siren, you would ruin me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito,\r\nlaughing, and kissing both her cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have been in the Via\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi long ago. No! I must go back now; you are in no danger.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take an apricot. Addio!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had already stepped two yards from her when he said the last word.\r\nTessa could not have spoken; she was pale, and a great sob was rising;\r\nbut she turned round as if she felt there was no hope for her, and\r\nstepped on, holding her apron so forgetfully that the apricots began to\r\nroll out on the grass.\r\n\r\nTito could not help looking after her, and seeing her shoulders rise to\r\nthe bursting sob, and the apricots fall\xe2\x80\x94could not help going after her\r\nand picking them up. It was very hard upon him: he was a long way off\r\nthe Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and very near to Tessa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, my silly one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, picking up the apricots. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, leave off\r\ncrying, I will go with you, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down under the tree. Come, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like to see you cry; but you know I must go back some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that they found a great plane-tree not far outside\r\nthe gates, and they sat down under it, and all the feast was spread out\r\non Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s lap, she leaning with her back against the trunk of the\r\ntree, and he stretched opposite to her, resting his elbows on the rough\r\ngreen growth cherished by the shade, while the sunlight stole through\r\nthe boughs and played about them like a winged thing. Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s face was\r\nall contentment again, and the taste of the apricots and sweetmeats\r\nseemed very good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pretty bird!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, looking at her as she sat eyeing the\r\nremains of the feast with an evident mental debate about saving them,\r\nsince he had said he would not have any more. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think of any one\r\nscolding you! What sins do you tell of at confession, Tessa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a great many. I am often naughty. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like work, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp being idle, though I know I shall be beaten and scolded; and I\r\ngive the mules the best fodder when nobody sees me, and then when the\r\nMadre is angry I say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, and that makes me frightened at\r\nthe devil. I think the conjuror was the devil. I am not so frightened\r\nafter I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to confession. And see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a _Breve_ here that a\r\ngood father, who came to Prato preaching this Easter, blessed and gave\r\nus all.\xe2\x80\x9d Here Tessa drew from her bosom a tiny bag carefully fastened\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think the holy Madonna will take care of me; she looks as if\r\nshe would; and perhaps if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t idle, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me be\r\nbeaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they are so cruel to you, Tessa, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to leave them,\r\nand go and live with a beautiful lady who would be kind to you, if she\r\nwould have you to wait upon her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa seemed to hold her breath for a moment or two. Then she said\r\ndoubtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen should you like to be my little servant, and live with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, smiling. He meant no more than to see what sort of pretty look\r\nand answer she would give.\r\n\r\nThere was a flush of joy immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take me with you now?\r\nAh! I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go home and be beaten then.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused a little while,\r\nand then added more doubtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I should like to fetch my\r\nblack-faced kid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must go back to your kid, my Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI must go the other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jupiter!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he went from under the shade of the tree,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is not a pleasant time of day to walk from here to the Via de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBardi; I am more inclined to lie down and sleep in this shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt ended so. Tito had an unconquerable aversion to anything unpleasant,\r\neven when an object very much loved and desired was on the other side\r\nof it. He had risen early; had waited; had seen sights, and had been\r\nalready walking in the sun: he was inclined for a siesta, and inclined\r\nall the more because little Tessa was there, and seemed to make the air\r\nsofter. He lay down on the grass again, putting his cap under his head\r\non a green tuft by the side of Tessa. That was not quite comfortable;\r\nso he moved again, and asked Tessa to let him rest his head against her\r\nlap; and in that way he soon fell asleep. Tessa sat quiet as a dove on\r\nits nest, just venturing, when he was fast asleep, to touch the\r\nwonderful dark curls that fell backward from his ear. She was too happy\r\nto go to sleep\xe2\x80\x94too happy to think that Tito would wake up, and that\r\nthen he would leave her, and she must go home. It takes very little\r\nwater to make a perfect pool for a tiny fish, where it will find its\r\nworld and paradise all in one, and never have a presentiment of the dry\r\nbank. The fretted summer shade, and stillness, and the gentle breathing\r\nof some loved life near\xe2\x80\x94it would be paradise to us all, if eager\r\nthought, the strong angel with the implacable brow, had not long since\r\nclosed the gates.\r\n\r\nIt really was a long while before the waking came\xe2\x80\x94before the long dark\r\neyes opened at Tessa, first with a little surprise, and then with a\r\nsmile, which was soon quenched by some preoccupying thought. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeeper sleep had broken into a doze, in which he felt himself in the\r\nVia de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, explaining his failure to appear at the appointed time.\r\nThe clear images of that doze urged him to start up at once to a\r\nsitting posture, and as he stretched his arms and shook his cap, he\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa, little one, you have let me sleep too long. My hunger and the\r\nshadows together tell me that the sun has done much travel since I fell\r\nasleep. I must lose no more time. Addio,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended, patting her cheek\r\nwith one hand, and settling his cap with the other.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, but there were signs in her face which made him speak\r\nagain in as serious and as chiding a tone as he could command\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Tessa, you must not cry. I shall be angry; I shall not love you\r\nif you cry. You must go home to your black-faced kid, or if you like\r\nyou may go back to the gate and see the horses start. But I can stay\r\nwith you no longer, and if you cry, I shall think you are troublesome\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rising tears were checked by terror at this change in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\nTessa turned very pale, and sat in trembling silence, with her blue\r\neyes widened by arrested tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook now,\xe2\x80\x9d Tito went on, soothingly, opening the wallet that hung at\r\nhis belt, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a pretty charm that I have had a long while\xe2\x80\x94ever\r\nsince I was in Sicily, a country a long way off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wallet had many little matters in it mingled with small coins, and\r\nhe had the usual difficulty in laying his finger on the right thing. He\r\nunhooked his wallet, and turned out the contents on Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s lap. Among\r\nthem was his onyx ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my ring!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, slipping it on the forefinger of his\r\nright-hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to put it on again this morning. Strange, I never\r\nmissed it! See, Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he spread out the smaller\r\narticles, and selected the one he was in search of. \xe2\x80\x9cSee this pretty\r\nlittle pointed bit of red coral\xe2\x80\x94like your goat\xe2\x80\x99s horn, is it not?\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhere is a hole in it, so you can put it on the cord round your neck\r\nalong with your _Breve_, and then the evil spirits can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you: if\r\nyou ever see them coming in the shadow round the corner, point this\r\nlittle coral horn at them, and they will run away. It is a \xe2\x80\x98buona\r\nfortuna,\xe2\x80\x99 and will keep you from harm when I am not with you. Come,\r\nundo the cord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa obeyed with a tranquillising sense that life was going to be\r\nsomething quite new, and that Tito would be with her often. All who\r\nremember their childhood remember the strange vague sense, when some\r\nnew experience came, that everything else was going to be changed, and\r\nthat there would be no lapse into the old monotony. So the bit of coral\r\nwas hung beside the tiny bag with the scrap of scrawled parchment in\r\nit, and Tessa felt braver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you will give me a kiss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, economising time by\r\nspeaking while he swept in the contents of the wallet and hung it at\r\nhis waist again, \xe2\x80\x9cand look happy, like a good girl, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Tessa had obediently put forward her lips in a moment, and kissed\r\nhis cheek as he hung down his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you pretty pigeon!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tito, laughing, pressing her round\r\ncheeks with his hands and crushing her features together so as to give\r\nthem a general impartial kiss.\r\n\r\nThen he started up and walked away, not looking round till he was ten\r\nyards from her, when he just turned and gave a parting beck. Tessa was\r\nlooking after him, but he could see that she was making no signs of\r\ndistress. It was enough for Tito if she did not cry while he was\r\npresent. The softness of his nature required that all sorrow should be\r\nhidden away from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder when Romola will kiss my cheek in that way?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Tito, as\r\nhe walked along. It seemed a tiresome distance now, and he almost\r\nwished he had not been so soft-hearted, or so tempted to linger in the\r\nshade. No other excuse was needed to Bardo and Romola than saying\r\nsimply that he had been unexpectedly hindered; he felt confident their\r\nproud delicacy would inquire no farther. He lost no time in getting to\r\nOgnissanti, and hastily taking some food there, he crossed the Arno by\r\nthe Ponte alia Carraja, and made his way as directly as possible\r\ntowards the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi.\r\n\r\nBut it was the hour when all the world who meant to be in particularly\r\ngood time to see the Corso were returning from the Borghi, or villages\r\njust outside the gates, where they had dined and reposed themselves;\r\nand the thoroughfares leading to the bridges were of course the issues\r\ntowards which the stream of sightseers tended. Just as Tito reached the\r\nPonte Vecchio and the entrance of the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, he was suddenly\r\nurged back towards the angle of the intersecting streets. A company on\r\nhorseback, coming from the Via Guicciardini, and turning up the Via de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBardi, had compelled the foot-passengers to recede hurriedly. Tito had\r\nbeen walking, as his manner was, with the thumb of his right-hand\r\nresting in his belt; and as he was thus forced to pause, and was\r\nlooking carelessly at the passing cavaliers, he felt a very thin cold\r\nhand laid on his. He started round, and saw the Dominican friar whose\r\nupturned face had so struck him in the morning. Seen closer, the face\r\nlooked more evidently worn by sickness and not by age; and again it\r\nbrought some strong but indefinite reminiscences to Tito.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, but\xe2\x80\x94from your face and your ring,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said the friar, in a\r\nfaint voice, \xe2\x80\x9cis not your name Tito Melema?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, also speaking faintly, doubly jarred by the cold\r\ntouch and the mystery. He was not apprehensive or timid through his\r\nimagination, but through his sensations and perceptions he could easily\r\nbe made to shrink and turn pale like a maiden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall fulfil my commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friar put his hand under his scapulary, and drawing out a small\r\nlinen bag which hung round his neck, took from it a bit of parchment,\r\ndoubled and stuck firmly together with some black adhesive substance,\r\nand placed it in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hand. On the outside was written in Italian, in\r\na small but distinct character\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tito Melema, aged twenty-three, with a dark, beautiful face, long\r\ndark curls, the brightest smile, and a large onyx ring on his right\r\nforefinger_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito did not look at the friar, but tremblingly broke open the bit of\r\nparchment. Inside, the words were\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I am sold for a slave: I think they are going to take me to Antioch.\r\nThe gems alone will serve to ransom me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito looked round at the friar, but could only ask a question with his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had it at Corinth,\xe2\x80\x9d the friar said, speaking with difficulty, like\r\none whose small strength had been overtaxed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI had it from a man who\r\nwas dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with a bounding of the heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the writer. The man who gave it me was a pilgrim, like myself, to\r\nwhom the writer had intrusted it, because he was journeying to Italy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the contents?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know them, but I conjecture them. Your friend is in slavery:\r\nyou will go and release him. But I am unable to talk now.\xe2\x80\x9d The friar,\r\nwhose voice had become feebler and feebler, sank down on the stone\r\nbench against the wall from which he had risen to touch Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nadding\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at San Marco; my name is Fra Luca.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Fra Luca had ceased to speak, Tito still stood by him in\r\nirresolution, and it was not till, the pressure of the passengers being\r\nremoved, the friar rose and walked slowly into the church of Santa\r\nFelicita, that Tito also went on his way along the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this monk is a Florentine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cif he is going to\r\nremain at Florence, everything must be disclosed.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt that a new\r\ncrisis had come, but he was not, for all that, too evidently agitated\r\nto pay his visit to Bardo, and apologise for his previous\r\nnon-appearance. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s talent for concealment was being fast developed\r\ninto something less neutral. It was still possible\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it might be\r\ninevitable\xe2\x80\x94for him to accept frankly the altered conditions, and avow\r\nBaldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s existence; but hardly without casting an unpleasant light\r\nbackward on his original reticence as studied equivocation in order to\r\navoid the fulfilment of a secretly recognised claim, to say nothing of\r\nhis quiet settlement of himself and investment of his florins, when, it\r\nwould be clear, his benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s fate had not been certified. It was at\r\nleast provisionally wise to act as if nothing had happened, and for the\r\npresent he would suspend decisive thought; there was all the night for\r\nmeditation, and no one would know the precise moment at which he had\r\nreceived the letter.\r\n\r\nSo he entered the room on the second storey\xe2\x80\x94where Romola and her father\r\nsat among the parchment and the marble, aloof from the life of the\r\nstreets on holidays as well as on common days\xe2\x80\x94with a face only a little\r\nless bright than usual, from regret at appearing so late: a regret\r\nwhich wanted no testimony, since he had given up the sight of the Corso\r\nin order to express it; and then set himself to throw extra animation\r\ninto the evening, though all the while his consciousness was at work\r\nlike a machine with complex action, leaving deposits quite distinct\r\nfrom the line of talk; and by the time he descended the stone stairs\r\nand issued from the grim door in the starlight, his mind had really\r\nreached a new stage in its formation of a purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd when, the next day, after he was free from his professorial work,\r\nhe turned up the Via del Cocomero towards the convent of San Marco, his\r\npurpose was fully shaped. He was going to ascertain from Fra Luca\r\nprecisely how much he conjectured of the truth, and on what grounds he\r\nconjectured it; and, further, how long he was to remain at San Marco.\r\nAnd on that fuller knowledge he hoped to mould a statement which would\r\nin any case save him from the necessity of quitting Florence. Tito had\r\nnever had occasion to fabricate an ingenious lie before: the occasion\r\nwas come now\xe2\x80\x94the occasion which circumstance never fails to beget on\r\ntacit falsity; and his ingenuity was ready. For he had convinced\r\nhimself that he was not bound to go in search of Baldassarre. He had\r\nonce said that on a fair assurance of his father\xe2\x80\x99s existence and\r\nwhereabout, he would unhesitatingly go after him. But, after all, _why_\r\nwas he bound to go? What, looked at closely, was the end of all life,\r\nbut to extract the utmost sum of pleasure? And was not his own blooming\r\nlife a promise of incomparably more pleasure, not for himself only, but\r\nfor others, than the withered wintry life of a man who was past the\r\ntime of keen enjoyment, and whose ideas had stiffened into barren\r\nrigidity? Those ideas had all been sown in the fresh soil of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, and were lively germs there: that was the proper order of\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94the order of nature, which treats all maturity as a mere nidus\r\nfor youth. Baldassarre had done his work, had had his draught of life:\r\nTito said it was _his_ turn now.\r\n\r\nAnd the prospect was so vague:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI think they are going to take me to\r\nAntioch:\xe2\x80\x9d here was a vista! After a long voyage, to spend months,\r\nperhaps years, in a search for which even now there was no guarantee\r\nthat it would not prove vain: and to leave behind at starting a life of\r\ndistinction and love: and to find, if he found anything, the old\r\nexacting companionship which was known by rote beforehand. Certainly\r\nthe gems and therefore the florins were, in a sense, Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s: in\r\nthe narrow sense by which the right of possession is determined in\r\nordinary affairs; but in that large and more radically natural view by\r\nwhich the world belongs to youth and strength, they were rather his who\r\ncould extract the most pleasure out of them. That, he was conscious,\r\nwas not the sentiment which the complicated play of human feelings had\r\nengendered in society. The men around him would expect that he should\r\nimmediately apply those florins to his benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s rescue. But what\r\nwas the sentiment of society?\xe2\x80\x94a mere tangle of anomalous traditions and\r\nopinions, which no wise man would take as a guide, except so far as his\r\nown comfort was concerned. Not that he cared for the florins save\r\nperhaps for Romola\xe2\x80\x99s sake: he would give up the florins readily enough.\r\nIt was the joy that was due to him and was close to his lips, which he\r\nfelt he was not bound to thrust away from him and so travel on,\r\nthirsting. Any maxims that required a man to fling away the good that\r\nwas needed to make existence sweet, were only the lining of human\r\nselfishness turned outward: they were made by men who wanted others to\r\nsacrifice themselves for their sake. He would rather that Baldassarre\r\nshould not suffer: he liked no one to suffer; but could any philosophy\r\nprove to him that he was bound to care for another\xe2\x80\x99s suffering more\r\nthan for his own? To do so he must have loved Baldassarre devotedly,\r\nand he did _not_ love him: was that his own fault? Gratitude! seen\r\nclosely, it made no valid claim: his father\xe2\x80\x99s life would have been\r\ndreary without him: are we convicted of a debt to men for the pleasures\r\nthey give themselves?\r\n\r\nHaving once begun to explain away Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s claim, Tito\xe2\x80\x99s thought\r\nshowed itself as active as a virulent acid, eating its rapid way\r\nthrough all the tissues of sentiment. His mind was destitute of that\r\ndread which has been erroneously decried as if it were nothing higher\r\nthan a man\xe2\x80\x99s animal care for his own skin: that awe of the Divine\r\nNemesis which was felt by religious pagans, and, though it took a more\r\npositive form under Christianity, is still felt by the mass of mankind\r\nsimply as a vague fear at anything which is called wrong-doing. Such\r\nterror of the unseen is so far above mere sensual cowardice that it\r\nwill annihilate that cowardice: it is the initial recognition of a\r\nmoral law restraining desire, and checks the hard bold scrutiny of\r\nimperfect thought into obligations which can never be proved to have\r\nany sanctity in the absence of feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is good,\xe2\x80\x9d sing the old\r\nEumenides, in Aeschylus, \xe2\x80\x9cthat fear should sit as the guardian of the\r\nsoul, forcing it into wisdom\xe2\x80\x94good that men should carry a threatening\r\nshadow in their hearts under the full sunshine; else, how should they\r\nlearn to revere the right?\xe2\x80\x9d That guardianship may become needless; but\r\nonly when all outward law has become needless\xe2\x80\x94only when duty and love\r\nhave united in one stream and made a common force.\r\n\r\nAs Tito entered the outer cloister of San Marco, and inquired for Fra\r\nLuca, there was no shadowy presentiment in his mind: he felt himself\r\ntoo cultured and sceptical for that: he had been nurtured in contempt\r\nfor the tales of priests whose impudent lives were a proverb, and in\r\nerudite familiarity with disputes concerning the Chief Good, which had\r\nafter all, he considered, left it a matter of taste. Yet fear was a\r\nstrong element in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s nature\xe2\x80\x94the fear of what he believed or saw was\r\nlikely to rob him of pleasure: and he had a definite fear that Fra Luca\r\nmight be the means of driving him from Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFra Luca? ah, he is gone to Fiesole\xe2\x80\x94to the Dominican monastery there.\r\nHe was taken on a litter in the cool of the morning. The poor Brother\r\nis very ill. Could you leave a message for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis answer was given by a _fra converso_, or lay brother, whose accent\r\ntold plainly that he was a raw contadino, and whose dull glance implied\r\nno curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks; my business can wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito turned away with a sense of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cThis friar is not likely to\r\nlive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw he was worn to a shadow. And at\r\nFiesole there will be nothing to recall me to his mind. Besides, if he\r\nshould come back, my explanation will serve as well then as now. But I\r\nwish I knew what it was that his face recalled to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nThe Prize is nearly Grasped.\r\n\r\n\r\nTito walked along with a light step, for the immediate fear had\r\nvanished; the usual joyousness of his disposition reassumed its\r\npredominance, and he was going to see Romola. Yet Romola\xe2\x80\x99s life seemed\r\nan image of that loving, pitying devotedness, that patient endurance of\r\nirksome tasks, from which he had shrunk and excused himself. But he was\r\nnot out of love with goodness, or prepared to plunge into vice: he was\r\nin his fresh youth, with soft pulses for all charm and loveliness; he\r\nhad still a healthy appetite for ordinary human joys, and the poison\r\ncould only work by degrees. He had sold himself to evil, but at present\r\nlife seemed so nearly the same to him that he was not conscious of the\r\nbond. He meant all things to go on as they had done before, both within\r\nand without him: he meant to win golden opinions by meritorious\r\nexertion, by ingenious learning, by amiable compliance: he was not\r\ngoing to do anything that would throw him out of harmony with the\r\nbeings he cared for. And he cared supremely for Romola; he wished to\r\nhave her for his beautiful and loving wife. There might be a wealthier\r\nalliance within the ultimate reach of successful accomplishments like\r\nhis, but there was no woman in all Florence like Romola. When she was\r\nnear him, and looked at him with her sincere hazel eyes, he was subdued\r\nby a delicious influence as strong and inevitable as those musical\r\nvibrations which take possession of us with a rhythmic empire that no\r\nsooner ceases than we desire it to begin again.\r\n\r\nAs he trod the stone stairs, when he was still outside the door, with\r\nno one but Maso near him, the influence seemed to have begun its work\r\nby the mere nearness of anticipation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, Tito mio,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, before Tito had spoken.\r\nThere was a new vigour in the voice, a new cheerfulness in the blind\r\nface, since that first interview more than two months ago. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nbrought fresh manuscript, doubtless; but since we were talking last\r\nnight I have had new ideas: we must take a wider scope\xe2\x80\x94we must go back\r\nupon our footsteps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, paying his homage to Romola as he advanced, went, as his custom\r\nwas, straight to Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and put his hand in the palm that was\r\nheld to receive it, placing himself on the cross-legged leather seat\r\nwith scrolled ends, close to Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his gentle way; \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought the new manuscript,\r\nbut that can wait your pleasure. I have young limbs, you know, and can\r\nwalk back up the hill without any difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not look at Romola as he said this, but he knew quite well that\r\nher eyes were fixed on him with delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well said, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d Bardo had already addressed Tito in this\r\nway once or twice of late. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I perceive with gladness that you do\r\nnot shrink from labour, without which, the poet has wisely said, life\r\nhas given nothing to mortals. It is too often the \xe2\x80\x98palma sine pulvere,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe prize of glory without the dust of the race, that attracts young\r\nambition. But what says the Greek? \xe2\x80\x98In the morning of life, work; in\r\nthe mid-day, give counsel; in the evening, pray.\xe2\x80\x99 It is true, I might\r\nbe thought to have reached that helpless evening; but not so, while I\r\nhave counsel within me which is yet unspoken. For my mind, as I have\r\noften said, was shut up as by a dam; the plenteous waters lay dark and\r\nmotionless; but you, my Tito, have opened a duct for them, and they\r\nrush forward with a force that surprises myself. And now, what I want\r\nis, that we should go over our preliminary ground again, with a wider\r\nscheme of comment and illustration: otherwise I may lose opportunities\r\nwhich I now see retrospectively, and which may never occur again. You\r\nmark what I am saying, Tito?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had just stooped to reach his manuscript, which had rolled down, and\r\nBardo\xe2\x80\x99s jealous ear was alive to the slight movement.\r\n\r\nTito might have been excused for shrugging his shoulders at the\r\nprospect before him, but he was not naturally impatient; moreover, he\r\nhad been bred up in that laborious erudition, at once minute and\r\ncopious, which was the chief intellectual task of the age; and with\r\nRomola near, he was floated along by waves of agreeable sensation that\r\nmade everything seem easy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou wish to enlarge your comments on certain\r\npassages we have cited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only so; I wish to introduce an occasional _excursus_, where we\r\nhave noticed an author to whom I have given special study; for I may\r\ndie too soon to achieve any separate work. And this is not a time for\r\nscholarly integrity and well-sifted learning to lie idle, when it is\r\nnot only rash ignorance that we have to fear, but when there are men\r\nlike Calderino, who, as Poliziano has well shown, have recourse to\r\nimpudent falsities of citation to serve the ends of their vanity and\r\nsecure a triumph to their own mistakes. Wherefore, my Tito, I think it\r\nnot well that we should let slip the occasion that lies under our\r\nhands. And now we will turn back to the point where we have cited the\r\npassage from Thucydides, and I wish you, by way of preliminary, to go\r\nwith me through all my notes on the Latin translation made by Lorenzo\r\nValla, for which the incomparable Pope Nicholas the Fifth\xe2\x80\x94with whose\r\npersonal notice I was honoured while I was yet young, and when he was\r\nstill Thomas of Sarzana\xe2\x80\x94paid him (I say not unduly) the sum of five\r\nhundred gold scudi. But inasmuch as Valla, though otherwise of dubious\r\nfame, is held in high honour for his severe scholarship, whence the\r\nepigrammatist has jocosely said of him that since he went among the\r\nshades, Pluto himself has not dared to speak in the ancient languages,\r\nit is the more needful that his name should not be as a stamp\r\nwarranting false wares; and therefore I would introduce an _excursus_\r\non Thucydides, wherein my castigations of Valla\xe2\x80\x99s text may find a\r\nfitting place. My Romola, thou wilt reach the needful volumes\xe2\x80\x94thou\r\nknowest them\xe2\x80\x94on the fifth shelf of the cabinet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito rose at the same moment with Romola, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI will reach them,\r\nif you will point them out,\xe2\x80\x9d and followed her hastily into the\r\nadjoining small room, where the walls were also covered with ranges of\r\nbooks in perfect order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, pointing upward; \xe2\x80\x9cevery book is just\r\nwhere it was when my father ceased to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito stood by her without hastening to reach the books. They had never\r\nbeen in this room together before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, turning her eyes full on Tito, with a look of\r\ngrave confidence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he will not weary you; this work makes him so\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me too, Romola\xe2\x80\x94if you will only let me say, I love you\xe2\x80\x94if you will\r\nonly think me worth loving a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis speech was the softest murmur, and the dark beautiful face, nearer\r\nto hers than it had ever been before, was looking at her with\r\nbeseeching tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do love you,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Romola; she looked at him with the same\r\nsimple majesty as ever, but her voice had never in her life before sunk\r\nto that murmur. It seemed to them both that they were looking at each\r\nother a long while before her lips moved again; yet it was but a moment\r\ntill she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know _now_ what it is to be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe faces just met, and the dark curls mingled for an instant with the\r\nrippling gold. Quick as lightning after that, Tito set his foot on a\r\nprojecting ledge of the book-shelves and reached down the needful\r\nvolumes. They were both contented to be silent and separate, for that\r\nfirst blissful experience of mutual consciousness was all the more\r\nexquisite for being unperturbed by immediate sensation.\r\n\r\nIt had all been as rapid as the irreversible mingling of waters, for\r\neven the eager and jealous Bardo had not become impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the volumes, my Romola?\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said, as they came near\r\nhim again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you will get your pen ready; for, as Tito marks off\r\nthe scholia we determine on extracting, it will be well for you to copy\r\nthem without delay\xe2\x80\x94numbering them carefully, mind, to correspond with\r\nthe numbers in the text which he will write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola always had some task which gave her a share in this joint work.\r\nTito took his stand at the leggio, where he both wrote and read, and\r\nshe placed herself at a table just in front of him, where she was ready\r\nto give into her father\xe2\x80\x99s hands anything that he might happen to want,\r\nor relieve him of a volume that he had done with. They had always been\r\nin that position since the work began, yet on this day it seemed new;\r\nit was so different now for them to be opposite each other; so\r\ndifferent for Tito to take a book from her, as she lifted it from her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s knee. Yet there was no finesse to secure an additional look or\r\ntouch. Each woman creates in her own likeness the love-tokens that are\r\noffered to her; and Romola\xe2\x80\x99s deep calm happiness encompassed Tito like\r\nthe rich but quiet evening light which dissipates all unrest.\r\n\r\nThey had been two hours at their work, and were just desisting because\r\nof the fading light, when the door opened and there entered a figure\r\nstrangely incongruous with the current of their thoughts and with the\r\nsuggestions of every object around them. It was the figure of a short\r\nstout black-eyed woman, about fifty, wearing a black velvet berretta,\r\nor close cap, embroidered with pearls, under which surprisingly massive\r\nblack braids surmounted the little bulging forehead, and fell in rich\r\nplaited curves over the ears, while an equally surprising carmine tint\r\non the upper region of the fat cheeks contrasted with the surrounding\r\nsallowness. Three rows of pearls and a lower necklace of gold reposed\r\non the horizontal cushion of her neck; the embroidered border of her\r\ntrailing black velvet gown and her embroidered long-drooping sleeves of\r\nrose-coloured damask, were slightly faded, but they conveyed to the\r\ninitiated eye the satisfactory assurance that they were the splendid\r\nresult of six months\xe2\x80\x99 labour by a skilled workman; and the\r\nrose-coloured petticoat, with its dimmed white fringe and seed-pearl\r\narabesques, was duly exhibited in order to suggest a similar pleasing\r\nreflection. A handsome coral rosary hung from one side of an\r\ninferential belt, which emerged into certainty with a large clasp of\r\nsilver wrought in niello; and, on the other side, where the belt again\r\nbecame inferential, hung a scarsella, or large purse, of crimson\r\nvelvet, stitched with pearls. Her little fat right-hand, which looked\r\nas if it had been made of paste, and had risen out of shape under\r\npartial baking, held a small book of devotions, also splendid with\r\nvelvet, pearls, and silver.\r\n\r\nThe figure was already too familiar to Tito to be startling, for Monna\r\nBrigida was a frequent visitor at Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s, being excepted from the\r\nsentence of banishment passed on feminine triviality, on the ground of\r\nher cousinship to his dead wife and her early care for Romola, who now\r\nlooked round at her with an affectionate smile, and rose to draw the\r\nleather seat to a due distance from her father\xe2\x80\x99s chair, that the coming\r\ngush of talk might not be too near his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_La cugina_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, interrogatively, detecting the short steps\r\nand the sweeping drapery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is your cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monna Brigida, in an alert voice,\r\nraising her fingers smilingly at Tito, and then lifting up her face to\r\nbe kissed by Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways the troublesome cousin breaking in on your\r\nwisdom,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, seating herself and beginning to fan herself with\r\nthe white veil hanging over her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well; if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring you\r\nsome news of the world now and then, I do believe you\xe2\x80\x99d forget there\r\nwas anything in life but these mouldy ancients, who want sprinkling\r\nwith holy water if all I hear about them is true. Not but what the\r\nworld is bad enough nowadays, for the scandals that turn up under one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnose at every corner\xe2\x80\x94_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear and see such things, but\r\none can\xe2\x80\x99t go about with one\xe2\x80\x99s head in a bag; and it was only\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x94well, well, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t burst out at me, Bardo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going\r\nto tell anything; if I\xe2\x80\x99m not as wise as the three kings, I know how\r\nmany legs go into one boot. But, nevertheless, Florence is a wicked\r\ncity\xe2\x80\x94is it not true, Messer Tito? for you go into the world. Not but\r\nwhat one must sin a little\xe2\x80\x94Messer Domeneddio expects that of us, else\r\nwhat are the blessed sacraments for? And what I say is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nreverence the saints, and not to set ourselves up as if we could be\r\nlike them, else life would be unbearable; as it will be if things go on\r\nafter this new fashion. For what do you think? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the wedding\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x94Dianora Acciajoli\xe2\x80\x99s with the young Albizzi that there has been\r\nso much talk of\xe2\x80\x94and everybody wondered at its being to-day instead of\r\nyesterday; but, _cieli_! such a wedding as it was might have been put\r\noff till the next Quaresima for a penance. For there was the bride\r\nlooking like a white nun\xe2\x80\x94not so much as a pearl about her\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nbridegroom as solemn as San Giuseppe. It\xe2\x80\x99s true! And half the people\r\ninvited were _Piagnoni_\xe2\x80\x94they call them _Piagnoni_ (funeral mourners:\r\nproperly, paid mourners) now, these new saints of Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaking. And to think of two families like the Albizzi and the Acciajoli\r\ntaking up such notions, when they could afford to wear the best! Well,\r\nwell, they invited me\xe2\x80\x94but they could do no other, seeing my husband was\r\nLuca Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s uncle by the mother\xe2\x80\x99s side\xe2\x80\x94and a pretty time I had of it\r\nwhile we waited under the canopy in front of the house, before they let\r\nus in. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in my clothes, it seemed, without giving\r\noffence; for there was Monna Berta, who has had worse secrets in her\r\ntime than any I could tell of myself, looking askance at me from under\r\nher hood like a _pinzochera_, (a Sister of the Third Order of Saint\r\nFrancis: an uncloistered nun) and telling me to read the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s book\r\nabout widows, from which she had found great guidance. Holy Madonna! it\r\nseems as if widows had nothing to do now but to buy their coffins, and\r\nthink it a thousand years till they get into them, instead of enjoying\r\nthemselves a little when they\xe2\x80\x99ve got their hands free for the first\r\ntime. And what do you think was the music we had, to make our dinner\r\nlively? A long discourse from Fra Domenico of San Marco, about the\r\ndoctrines of their blessed Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x94the three doctrines we are all\r\nto get by heart; and he kept marking them off on his fingers till he\r\nmade my flesh creep: and the first is, Florence, or the Church\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow which, for first he said one and then the other\xe2\x80\x94shall be scourged;\r\nbut if he means the pestilence, the Signory ought to put a stop to such\r\npreaching, for it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to raise the swelling under one\xe2\x80\x99s arms with\r\nfright: but then, after that, he says Florence is to be regenerated;\r\nbut what will be the good of that when we\xe2\x80\x99re all dead of the plague, or\r\nsomething else? And then, the third thing, and what he said oftenest,\r\nis, that it\xe2\x80\x99s all to be in our days: and he marked that off on his\r\nthumb, till he made me tremble like the very jelly before me. They had\r\njellies, to be sure, with the arms of the Albizzi and the Acciajoli\r\nraised on them in all colours; they\xe2\x80\x99ve not turned the world quite\r\nupside down yet. But all their talk is, that we are to go back to the\r\nold ways: for up starts Francesco Valori, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve danced with in the\r\nVia Larga when he was a bachelor and as fond of the Medici as anybody,\r\nand he makes a speech about the old times, before the Florentines had\r\nleft off crying \xe2\x80\x98Popolo\xe2\x80\x99 and begun to cry \xe2\x80\x98Palle\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94as if that had\r\nanything to do with a wedding!\xe2\x80\x94and how we ought to keep to the rules\r\nthe Signory laid down heaven knows when, that we were not to wear this\r\nand that, and not to eat this and that\xe2\x80\x94and how our manners were\r\ncorrupted and we read bad books; though he can\xe2\x80\x99t say that of _me_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, cousin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, in his imperious tone, for he had a remark\r\nto make, and only desperate measures could arrest the rattling\r\nlengthiness of Monna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s discourse. But now she gave a little\r\nstart, pursed up her mouth, and looked at him with round eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrancesco Valori is not altogether wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Bardo went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBernardo,\r\nindeed, rates him not highly, and is rather of opinion that he\r\nchristens private grudges by the name of public zeal; though I must\r\nadmit that my good Bernardo is too slow of belief in that unalloyed\r\npatriotism which was found in all its lustre amongst the ancients. But\r\nit is true, Tito, that our manners have degenerated somewhat from that\r\nnoble frugality which, as has been well seen in the public acts of our\r\ncitizens, is the parent of true magnificence. For men, as I hear, will\r\nnow spend on the transient show of a Giostra sums which would suffice\r\nto found a library, and confer a lasting possession on mankind. Still,\r\nI conceive, it remains true of us Florentines that we have more of that\r\nmagnanimous sobriety which abhors a trivial lavishness that it may be\r\ngrandly open-handed on grand occasions, than can be found in any other\r\ncity of Italy; for I understand that the Neapolitan and Milanese\r\ncourtiers laugh at the scarcity of our plate, and think scorn of our\r\ngreat families for borrowing from each other that furniture of the\r\ntable at their entertainments. But in the vain laughter of folly wisdom\r\nhears half its applause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaughter, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d burst forth Monna Brigida again, the moment, Bardo\r\npaused. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anybody wanted to hear laughter at the wedding to-day they\r\nwere disappointed, for when young Niccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli tried to make a\r\njoke, and told stories out of Franco Sacchetti\xe2\x80\x99s book, how it was no\r\nuse for the Signoria to make rules for us women, because we were\r\ncleverer than all the painters, and architects, and doctors of logic in\r\nthe world, for we could make black look white, and yellow look pink,\r\nand crooked look straight, and, if anything was forbidden, we could\r\nfind a new name for it\xe2\x80\x94Holy Virgin! the Piagnoni looked more dismal\r\nthan before, and somebody said Sacchetti\xe2\x80\x99s book was wicked. Well, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t read it\xe2\x80\x94they can\xe2\x80\x99t accuse _me_ of reading anything. Save me from\r\ngoing to a wedding again, if that\xe2\x80\x99s to be the fashion; for all of us\r\nwho were not Piagnoni were as comfortable as wet chickens. I was never\r\ncaught in a worse trap but once before, and that was when I went to\r\nhear their precious Frate last Quaresima in San Lorenzo. Perhaps I\r\nnever told you about it, Messer Tito?\xe2\x80\x94it almost freezes my blood when I\r\nthink of it. How he rated us poor women! and the men, too, to tell the\r\ntruth, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that so much. He called us cows, and lumps of\r\nflesh, and wantons, and mischief-makers\xe2\x80\x94and I could just bear that, for\r\nthere were plenty others more fleshy and spiteful than I was, though\r\nevery now and then his voice shook the very bench under me like a\r\ntrumpet; but then he came to the false hair, and, O misericordia! he\r\nmade a picture\xe2\x80\x94I see it now\xe2\x80\x94of a young woman lying a pale corpse, and\r\nus light-minded widows\xe2\x80\x94of course he meant me as well as the rest, for I\r\nhad my plaits on, for if one is getting old, one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to look\r\nas ugly as the Befana,[1]\xe2\x80\x94us widows rushing up to the corpse, like\r\nbare-pated vultures as we were, and cutting off its young dead hair to\r\ndeck our old heads with. Oh, the dreams I had after that! And then he\r\ncried, and wrung his hands at us, and I cried too. And to go home, and\r\nto take off my jewels, this very clasp, and everything, and to make\r\nthem into a packet, _f\xc3\xb9 tutt\xe2\x80\x99uno_; and I was within a hair of sending\r\nthem to the Good Men of Saint Martin to give to the poor, but, by\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, I bethought me of going first to my confessor, Fra\r\nCristoforo, at Santa Croce, and he told me how it was all the work of\r\nthe devil, this preaching and prophesying of their Fra Girolamo, and\r\nthe Dominicans were trying to turn the world upside down, and I was\r\nnever to go and hear him again, else I must do penance for it; for the\r\ngreat preachers Fra Mariano and Fra Menico had shown how Fra Girolamo\r\npreached lies\xe2\x80\x94and that was true, for I heard them both in the Duomo\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhow the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s dream of San Francesco propping up the Church with his\r\narms was being fulfilled still, and the Dominicans were beginning to\r\npull it down. Well and good: I went away _con Dio_, and made myself\r\neasy. I am not going to be frightened by a Frate Predicatore again. And\r\nall I say is, I wish it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been the Dominicans that poor Dino\r\njoined years ago, for then I should have been glad when I heard them\r\nsay he was come back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] The name given to the grotesque black-faced figures, supposed to\r\n represent the Magi, carried about or placed in the windows on Twelfth\r\n Night: a corruption of Epifania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilenzio!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, in a loud agitated voice, while Romola half\r\nstarted from her chair, clasped her hands, and looked round at Tito, as\r\nif now she might appeal to him. Monna Brigida gave a little scream, and\r\nbit her lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonna!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, again, \xe2\x80\x9chear once more my will. Bring no reports\r\nabout that name to this house; and thou, Romola, I forbid thee to ask.\r\nMy son is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo\xe2\x80\x99s whole frame seemed vibrating with passion, and no one dared to\r\nbreak silence again. Monna Brigida lifted her shoulders and her hands\r\nin mute dismay; then she rose as quietly as possible, gave many\r\nsignificant nods to Tito and Romola, motioning to them that they were\r\nnot to move, and stole out of the room like a culpable fat spaniel who\r\nhas barked unseasonably.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tito\xe2\x80\x99s quick mind had been combining ideas with\r\nlightning-like rapidity. Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s son was not really dead, then, as he\r\nhad supposed: he was a monk; he was \xe2\x80\x9ccome back:\xe2\x80\x9d and Fra Luca\xe2\x80\x94yes! it\r\nwas the likeness to Bardo and Romola that had made the face seem\r\nhalf-known to him. If he were only dead at Fiesole at that moment! This\r\nimportunate selfish wish inevitably thrust itself before every other\r\nthought. It was true that Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s rigid will was a sufficient safeguard\r\nagainst any intercourse between Romola and her brother; but _not_\r\nagainst the betrayal of what he knew to others, especially when the\r\nsubject was suggested by the coupling of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s name with that of the\r\nvery Tito Melema whose description he had carried round his neck as an\r\nindex. No! nothing but Fra Luca\xe2\x80\x99s death could remove all danger; but\r\nhis death was highly probable, and after the momentary shock of the\r\ndiscovery, Tito let his mind fall back in repose on that confident\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nThey had sat in silence, and in a deepening twilight for many minutes,\r\nwhen Romola ventured to say\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I light the lamp, father, and shall we go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my Romola, we will work no more to-night. Tito, come and sit by me\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito moved from the reading-desk, and seated himself on the other side\r\nof Bardo, close to his left elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome nearer to me, figliuola mia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo again, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npause. And Romola seated herself on a low stool and let her arm rest on\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s right knee, that he might lay his hand on her hair, as he\r\nwas fond of doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, I never told you that I had once a son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, forgetting\r\nwhat had fallen from him in the emotion raised by their first\r\ninterview. The old man had been deeply shaken, and was forced to pour\r\nout his feelings in spite of pride. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he left me\xe2\x80\x94he is dead to me. I\r\nhave disowned him for ever. He was a ready scholar as you are, but more\r\nfervid and impatient, and yet sometimes rapt and self-absorbed, like a\r\nflame fed by some fitful source; showing a disposition from the very\r\nfirst to turn away his eyes from the clear lights of reason and\r\nphilosophy, and to prostrate himself under the influences of a dim\r\nmysticism which eludes all rules of human duty as it eludes all\r\nargument. And so it ended. We will speak no more of him: he is dead to\r\nme. I wish his face could be blotted from that world of memory in which\r\nthe distant seems to grow clearer and the near to fade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBardo paused, but neither Romola nor Tito dared to speak\xe2\x80\x94his voice was\r\ntoo tremulous, the poise of his feelings too doubtful. But he presently\r\nraised his hand and found Tito\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder to rest it on, while he went\r\non speaking, with an effort to be calmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _you_ have come to me, Tito\xe2\x80\x94not quite too late. I will lose no\r\ntime in vain regret. When you are working by my side I seem to have\r\nfound a son again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man, preoccupied with the governing interest of his life, was\r\nonly thinking of the much-meditated book which had quite thrust into\r\nthe background the suggestion, raised by Bernardo del Nero\xe2\x80\x99s warning,\r\nof a possible marriage between Tito and Romola. But Tito could not\r\nallow the moment to pass unused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me be always and altogether your son? Will you let me\r\ntake care of Romola\xe2\x80\x94be her husband? I think she will not deny me. She\r\nhas said she loves me. I know I am not equal to her in birth\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nanything; but I am no longer a destitute stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true, my Romola?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, in a lower tone, an evident\r\nvibration passing through him and dissipating the saddened aspect of\r\nhis features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI love Tito\xe2\x80\x94I wish to marry him,\r\nthat we may both be your children and never part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s hand met hers in a strong clasp for the first time, while she\r\nwas speaking, but their eyes were fixed anxiously on her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it not be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, as if arguing against any\r\nopposition to his assent, rather than assenting. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a\r\nhappiness to me; and thou, too, Romola, wouldst be the happier for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stroked her long hair gently and bent towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I have been apt to forget that thou needest some other love than\r\nmine. And thou wilt be a noble wife. Bernardo thinks I shall hardly\r\nfind a husband fitting for thee. And he is perhaps right. For thou art\r\nnot like the herd of thy sex: thou art such a woman as the immortal\r\npoets had a vision of when they sang the lives of the heroes\xe2\x80\x94tender but\r\nstrong, like thy voice, which has been to me instead of the light in\r\nthe years of my blindness... And so thou lovest him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat upright again for a minute, and then said, in the same tone as\r\nbefore, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it not be? I will think of it; I will talk with\r\nBernardo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito felt a disagreeable chill at this answer, for Bernardo del Nero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes had retained their keen suspicion whenever they looked at him, and\r\nthe uneasy remembrance of Fra Luca converted all uncertainty into fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak for me, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pleadingly. \xe2\x80\x9cMesser Bernardo is sure\r\nto be against me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cmy godfather will not oppose what my father\r\nfirmly wills. And it is your will that I should marry Tito\xe2\x80\x94is it not\r\ntrue, father? Nothing has ever come to me before that I have wished for\r\nstrongly: I did not think it possible that I could care so much for\r\nanything that could happen to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a brief and simple plea; but it was the condensed story of\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s self-repressing colourless young life, which had thrown all\r\nits passion into sympathy with aged sorrows, aged ambition, aged pride\r\nand indignation. It had never occurred to Romola that she should not\r\nspeak as directly and emphatically of her love for Tito as of any other\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola mia!\xe2\x80\x9d said her father fondly, pausing on the words, \xe2\x80\x9cit is true\r\nthou hast never urged on me any wishes of thy own. And I have no will\r\nto resist thine; rather, my heart met Tito\xe2\x80\x99s entreaty at its very first\r\nutterance. Nevertheless, I must talk with Bernardo about the measures\r\nneedful to be observed. For we must not act in haste, or do anything\r\nunbeseeming my name. I am poor, and held of little account by the\r\nwealthy of our family\xe2\x80\x94nay, I may consider myself a lonely man\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nmust nevertheless remember that generous birth has its obligations. And\r\nI would not be reproached by my fellow-citizens for rash haste in\r\nbestowing my daughter. Bartolommeo Scala gave his Alessandra to the\r\nGreek Marullo, but Marullo\xe2\x80\x99s lineage was well-known, and Scala himself\r\nis of no extraction. I know Bernardo will hold that we must take time:\r\nhe will, perhaps, reproach me with want of due forethought. Be patient,\r\nmy children: you are very young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo more could be said, and Romola\xe2\x80\x99s heart was perfectly satisfied. Not\r\nso Tito\xe2\x80\x99s. If the subtle mixture of good and evil prepares suffering\r\nfor human truth and purity, there is also suffering prepared for the\r\nwrong-doer by the same mingled conditions. As Tito kissed Romola on\r\ntheir parting that evening, the very strength of the thrill that moved\r\nhis whole being at the sense that this woman, whose beauty it was\r\nhardly possible to think of as anything but the necessary consequence\r\nof her noble nature, loved him with all the tenderness that spoke in\r\nher clear eyes, brought a strong reaction of regret that he had not\r\nkept himself free from that first deceit which had dragged him into the\r\ndanger of being disgraced before her. There was a spring of bitterness\r\nmingling with that fountain of sweets. Would the death of Fra Luca\r\narrest it? He hoped it would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nThe Shadow of Nemesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the lazy afternoon time on the seventh of September, more than\r\ntwo months after the day on which Romola and Tito had confessed their\r\nlove to each other.\r\n\r\nTito, just descended into Nello\xe2\x80\x99s shop, had found the barber stretched\r\non the bench with his cap over his eyes; one leg was drawn up, and the\r\nother had slipped towards the ground, having apparently carried with it\r\na manuscript volume of verse, which lay with its leaves crushed. In a\r\ncorner sat Sandro, playing a game at _mora_ by himself, and watching\r\nthe slow reply of his left fingers to the arithmetical demands of his\r\nright with solemn-eyed interest.\r\n\r\nTreading with the gentlest step, Tito snatched up the lute, and bending\r\nover the barber, touched the strings lightly while he sang\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuant\xe2\x80\x99 \xc3\xa8 bella giovinezza,\r\nChe si fugge tuttavia!\r\nChi vuol esser lieto sia,\r\nDi doman non c\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa8 certezza.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9cBeauteous is life in blossom!\r\nAnd it fleeteth\xe2\x80\x94fleeteth ever;\r\nWhoso would be joyful\xe2\x80\x94let him!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no surety for the morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Carnival Song by Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNello was as easily awaked as a bird. The cap was off his eyes in an\r\ninstant, and he started up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my Apollino! I am somewhat late with my siesta on this hot day, it\r\nseems. That comes of not going to sleep in the natural way, but taking\r\na potion of potent poesy. Hear you, how I am beginning to match my\r\nwords by the initial letter, like a Trovatore? That is one of my bad\r\nsymptoms: I am sorely afraid that the good wine of my understanding is\r\ngoing to run off at the spigot of authorship, and I shall be left an\r\nempty cask with an odour of dregs, like many another incomparable\r\ngenius of my acquaintance. What is it, my Orpheus?\xe2\x80\x9d here Nello\r\nstretched out his arms to their full length, and then brought them\r\nround till his hands grasped Tito\xe2\x80\x99s curls, and drew them out playfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want of your well-tamed Nello? For I perceive a coaxing\r\nsound in that soft strain of yours. Let me see the very needle\xe2\x80\x99s eye of\r\nyour desire, as the sublime poet says, that I may thread it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is but a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s image of your sublime poet\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, still\r\nletting his fingers fall in a light dropping way on the strings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou have divined the reason of my affectionate impatience to see your\r\neyes open. I want you to give me an extra touch of your art\xe2\x80\x94not on my\r\nchin, no; but on the zazzera, which is as tangled as your Florentine\r\npolitics. You have an adroit way of inserting your comb, which flatters\r\nthe skin, and stirs the animal spirits agreeably in that region; and a\r\nlittle of your most delicate orange-scent would not lie amiss, for I am\r\nbound to the Scala palace, and am to present myself in radiant company.\r\nThe young cardinal Giovanni de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici is to be there, and he brings\r\nwith him a certain young Bernardo Dovizi of Bibbiena, whose wit is so\r\nrapid that I see no way of out-rivalling it save by the scent of\r\norange-blossoms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNello had already seized and flourished his comb, and pushed Tito\r\ngently backward into the chair, wrapping the cloth round him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever talk of rivalry, bel giovane mio: Bernardo Dovizi is a keen\r\nyoungster, who will never carry a net out to catch the wind; but he has\r\nsomething of the same sharp-muzzled look as his brother Ser Piero, the\r\nweasel that Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici keeps at his beck to slip through small\r\nholes for him. No! you distance all rivals, and may soon touch the sky\r\nwith your forefinger. They tell me you have even carried enough honey\r\nwith you to sweeten the sour Messer Angelo; for he has pronounced you\r\nless of an ass than might have been expected, considering there is such\r\na good understanding between you and the Secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd between ourselves, Nello mio, that Messer Angelo has more genius\r\nand erudition than I can find in all the other Florentine scholars put\r\ntogether. It may answer very well for them to cry me up now, when\r\nPoliziano is beaten down with grief, or illness, or something else; I\r\ncan try a flight with such a sparrow-hawk as Pietro Crinito, but for\r\nPoliziano, he is a large-beaked eagle who would swallow me, feathers\r\nand all, and not feel any difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not contradict your modesty there, if you will have it so; but\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t expect us clever Florentines to keep saying the same things\r\nover again every day of our lives, as we must do if we always told the\r\ntruth. We cry down Dante, and we cry up Francesco Cei, just for the\r\nsake of variety; and if we cry you up as a new Poliziano, heaven has\r\ntaken care that it shall not be quite so great a lie as it might have\r\nbeen. And are you not a pattern of virtue in this wicked city? with\r\nyour ears double-waxed against all siren invitations that would lure\r\nyou from the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and the great work which is to astonish\r\nposterity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPosterity in good truth, whom it will probably astonish as the\r\nuniverse does, by the impossibility of seeing what was the plan of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, something like that was being prophesied here the other day.\r\nCristoforo Landino said that the excellent Bardo was one of those\r\nscholars who lie overthrown in their learning, like cavaliers in heavy\r\narmour, and then get angry because they are over-ridden\xe2\x80\x94which pithy\r\nremark, it seems to me, was not a herb out of his own garden; for of\r\nall men, for feeding one with an empty spoon and gagging one with vain\r\nexpectation by long discourse, Messer Cristoforo is the pearl. Ecco!\r\nyou are perfect now.\xe2\x80\x9d Here Nello drew away the cloth. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible to\r\nadd a grace more! But love is not always to be fed on learning, eh? I\r\nshall have to dress the zazzera for the betrothal before long\xe2\x80\x94is it not\r\ntrue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cunless Messer Bernardo should next\r\nrecommend Bardo to require that I should yoke a lion and a wild boar to\r\nthe car of the Zecca before I can win my Alcestis. But I confess he is\r\nright in holding me unworthy of Romola; she is a Pleiad that may grow\r\ndim by marrying any mortal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Gnaff\xc3\xa8_, your modesty is in the right place there. Yet fate seems to\r\nhave measured and chiselled you for the niche that was left empty by\r\nthe old man\xe2\x80\x99s son, who, by the way, Cronaca was telling me, is now at\r\nSan Marco. Did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight electric shock passed through Tito as he rose from the chair,\r\nbut it was not outwardly perceptible, for he immediately stooped to\r\npick up the fallen book, and busied his fingers with flattening the\r\nleaves, while he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he was at Fiesole, I thought. Are you sure he is come back to San\r\nMarco?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCronaca is my authority,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t frequent\r\nthat sanctuary, but he does. Ah,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, taking the book from Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, \xe2\x80\x9cmy poor Nencia da Barberino! It jars your scholarly feelings to\r\nsee the pages dog\xe2\x80\x99s-eared. I was lulled to sleep by the well-rhymed\r\ncharms of that rustic maiden\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98prettier than the turnip-flower,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98with a\r\ncheek more savoury than cheese.\xe2\x80\x99 But to get such a well-scented notion\r\nof the contadina, one must lie on velvet cushions in the Via Larga\xe2\x80\x94not\r\ngo to look at the Fierucoloni stumping in to the Piazza della Nunziata\r\nthis evening after sundown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray who are the Fierucoloni?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, indifferently, settling\r\nhis cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe contadine who came from the mountains of Pistoia, and the\r\nCasentino, and heaven knows where, to keep their vigil in the church of\r\nthe Nunziata, and sell their yarn and dried mushrooms at the Fierucola\r\n(the little Fair), as we call it. They make a queer show, with their\r\npaper lanterns, howling their hymns to the Virgin on this eve of her\r\nnativity\xe2\x80\x94if you had the leisure to see them. No?\xe2\x80\x94well, I have had\r\nenough of it myself, for there is wild work in the Piazza. One may\r\nhappen to get a stone or two about one\xe2\x80\x99s ears or shins without asking\r\nfor it, and I was never fond of that pressing attention. Addio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito carried a little uneasiness with him on his visit, which ended\r\nearlier than he had expected, the boy-cardinal Giovanni de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici,\r\nyoungest of red-hatted fathers, who has since presented his broad dark\r\ncheek very conspicuously to posterity as Pope Leo the Tenth, having\r\nbeen detained at his favourite pastime of the chase, and having failed\r\nto appear. It still wanted half an hour of sunset as he left the door\r\nof the Scala palace, with the intention of proceeding forthwith to the\r\nVia de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi; but he had not gone far when, to his astonishment, he\r\nsaw Romola advancing towards him along the Borgo Pinti.\r\n\r\nShe wore a thick black veil and black mantle, but it was impossible to\r\nmistake her figure and her walk; and by her side was a short stout\r\nform, which he recognised as that of Monna Brigida, in spite of the\r\nunusual plainness of her attire. Romola had not been bred up to\r\ndevotional observances, and the occasions on which she took the air\r\nelsewhere than under the loggia on the roof of the house, were so rare\r\nand so much dwelt on beforehand, because of Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s dislike to be left\r\nwithout her, that Tito felt sure there must have been some sudden and\r\nurgent ground for an absence of which he had heard nothing the day\r\nbefore. She saw him through her veil and hastened her steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola, has anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, turning to walk by her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer at the first moment, and Monna Brigida broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Messer Tito, you do well to turn round, for we are in haste. And\r\nis it not a misfortune?\xe2\x80\x94we are obliged to go round by the walls and\r\nturn up the Via del Maglio, because of the Fair; for the contadine\r\ncoming in block up the way by the Nunziata, which would have taken us\r\nto San Marco in half the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s heart gave a great bound, and began to beat violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a lower tone, \xe2\x80\x9care you going to San Marco?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were now out of the Borgo Pinti and were under the city walls,\r\nwhere they had wide gardens on their left-hand, and all was quiet.\r\nRomola put aside her veil for the sake of breathing the air, and he\r\ncould see the subdued agitation in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Tito mio,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking directly at him with sad eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nthe first time I am doing something unknown to my father. It comforts\r\nme that I have met you, for at least I can tell _you_. But if you are\r\ngoing to him, it will be well for you not to say that you met me. He\r\nthinks I am only gone to my cousin, because she sent for me. I left my\r\ngodfather with him: _he_ knows where I am going, and why. You remember\r\nthat evening when my brother\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned and my father spoke\r\nof him to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, in a low tone. There was a strange complication in\r\nhis mental state. His heart sank at the probability that a great change\r\nwas coming over his prospects, while at the same time his thoughts were\r\ndarting over a hundred details of the course he would take when the\r\nchange had come; and yet he returned Romola\xe2\x80\x99s gaze with a hungry sense\r\nthat it might be the last time she would ever bend it on him with full\r\nunquestioning confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _cugina_ had heard that he was come back, and the evening\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94the evening of San Giovanni\xe2\x80\x94as I afterwards found, he had been\r\nseen by our good Maso near the door of our house; but when Maso went to\r\ninquire at San Marco, Dino, that is, my brother\xe2\x80\x94he was christened\r\nBernardino, after our godfather, but now he calls himself Fra Luca\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nbeen taken to the monastery at Fiesole, because he was ill. But this\r\nmorning a message came to Maso, saying that he was come back to San\r\nMarco, and Maso went to him there. He is very ill, and he has adjured\r\nme to go and see him. I cannot refuse it, though I hold him guilty; I\r\nstill remember how I loved him when I was a little girl, before I knew\r\nthat he would forsake my father. And perhaps he has some word of\r\npenitence to send by me. It cost me a struggle to act in opposition to\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s feeling, which I have always held to be just. I am almost\r\nsure you will think I have chosen rightly, Tito, because I have noticed\r\nthat your nature is less rigid than mine, and nothing makes you angry:\r\nit would cost you less to be forgiving; though, if you had seen your\r\nfather forsaken by one to whom he had given his chief love\xe2\x80\x94by one in\r\nwhom he had planted his labour and his hopes\xe2\x80\x94forsaken when his need was\r\nbecoming greatest\xe2\x80\x94even you, Tito, would find it hard to forgive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat could he say? He was not equal to the hypocrisy of telling Romola\r\nthat such offences ought not to be pardoned; and he had not the courage\r\nto utter any words of dissuasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, my Romola; you are always right, except in thinking too\r\nwell of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was really some genuineness in those last words, and Tito looked\r\nvery beautiful as he uttered them, with an unusual pallor in his face,\r\nand a slight quivering of his lip. Romola, interpreting all things\r\nlargely, like a mind prepossessed with high beliefs, had a tearful\r\nbrightness in her eyes as she looked at him, touched with keen joy that\r\nhe felt so strongly whatever she felt. But without pausing in her walk,\r\nshe said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Tito, I wish you to leave me, for the _cugina_ and I shall be\r\nless noticed if we enter the piazza alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it were better you should leave us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monna Brigida; \xe2\x80\x9cfor to\r\nsay the truth, Messer Tito, all eyes follow you, and let Romola muffle\r\nherself as she will, every one wants to see what there is under her\r\nveil, for she has that way of walking like a procession. Not that I\r\nfind fault with her for it, only it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit my steps. And, indeed,\r\nI would rather not have us seen going to San Marco, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I am\r\ndressed as if I were one of the Piagnoni themselves, and as old as\r\nSant\xe2\x80\x99 Anna; for if it had been anybody but poor Dino, who ought to be\r\nforgiven if he\xe2\x80\x99s dying, for what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of having a grudge against\r\ndead people?\xe2\x80\x94make them feel while they live, say I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one made a scruple of interrupting Monna Brigida, and Tito, having\r\njust raised Romola\xe2\x80\x99s hand to his lips, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand, I obey\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d now turned away, lifting his cap\xe2\x80\x94a sign of reverence rarely made\r\nat that time by native Florentines, and which excited Bernardo del\r\nNero\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for Tito as a fawning Greek, while to Romola, who loved\r\nhomage, it gave him an exceptional grace.\r\n\r\nHe was half glad of the dismissal, half disposed to cling to Romola to\r\nthe last moment in which she would love him without suspicion. For it\r\nseemed to him certain that this brother would before all things want to\r\nknow, and that Romola would before all things confide to him, what was\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s position and her own after the years which must have\r\nbrought so much change. She would tell him that she was soon to be\r\npublicly betrothed to a young scholar, who was to fill up the place\r\nleft vacant long ago by a wandering son. He foresaw the impulse that\r\nwould prompt Romola to dwell on that prospect, and what would follow on\r\nthe mention of the future husband\xe2\x80\x99s name. Fra Luca would tell all he\r\nknew and conjectured, and Tito saw no possible falsity by which he\r\ncould now ward off the worst consequences of his former dissimulation.\r\nIt was all over with his prospects in Florence. There was Messer\r\nBernardo del Nero, who would be delighted at seeing confirmed the\r\nwisdom of his advice about deferring the betrothal until Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter and position had been established by a longer residence; and\r\nthe history of the young Greek professor, whose benefactor was in\r\nslavery, would be the talk under every loggia. For the first time in\r\nhis life he felt too fevered and agitated to trust his power of\r\nself-command; he gave up his intended visit to Bardo, and walked up and\r\ndown under the walls until the yellow light in the west had quite\r\nfaded, when, without any distinct purpose, he took the first turning,\r\nwhich happened to be the Via San Sebastiano, leading him directly\r\ntowards the Piazza dell\xe2\x80\x99 Annunziata.\r\n\r\nHe was at one of those lawless moments which come to us all if we have\r\nno guide but desire, and if the pathway where desire leads us seems\r\nsuddenly closed; he was ready to follow any beckoning that offered him\r\nan immediate purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nThe Peasants\xe2\x80\x99 Fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moving crowd and the strange mixture of noises that burst on him at\r\nthe entrance of the piazza, reminded Tito of what Nello had said to him\r\nabout the Fierucoloni, and he pushed his way into the crowd with a sort\r\nof pleasure in the hooting and elbowing, which filled the empty\r\nmoments, and dulled that calculation of the future which had so new a\r\ndreariness for him, as he foresaw himself wandering away solitary in\r\npursuit of some unknown fortune, that his thought had even glanced\r\ntowards going in search of Baldassarre after all.\r\n\r\nAt each of the opposite inlets he saw people struggling into the\r\npiazza, while above them paper lanterns, held aloft on sticks, were\r\nwaving uncertainly to and fro. A rude monotonous chant made a\r\ndistinctly traceable strand of noise, across which screams, whistles,\r\ngibing chants in piping boyish voices, the beating of drums, and the\r\nringing of little bells, met each other in confused din. Every now and\r\nthen one of the dim floating lights disappeared with a smash from a\r\nstone launched more or less vaguely in pursuit of mischief, followed by\r\na scream and renewed shouts. But on the outskirts of the whirling\r\ntumult there were groups who were keeping this vigil of the Nativity of\r\nthe Virgin in a more methodical manner than by fitful stone-throwing\r\nand gibing. Certain ragged men, darting a hard sharp glance around them\r\nwhile their tongues rattled merrily, were inviting country people to\r\ngame with them on fair and open-handed terms; two masquerading figures\r\non stilts, who had snatched lanterns from the crowd, were swaying the\r\nlights to and fro in meteoric fashion, as they strode hither and\r\nthither; a sage trader was doing a profitable business at a small\r\ncovered stall, in hot _berlingozzi_, a favourite farinaceous delicacy;\r\none man standing on a barrel, with his back firmly planted against a\r\npillar of the loggia in front of the Foundling Hospital (Spedale degl\xe2\x80\x99\r\nInnocenti), was selling efficacious pills, invented by a doctor of\r\nSalerno, warranted to prevent toothache and death by drowning; and not\r\nfar off, against another pillar, a tumbler was showing off his tricks\r\non a small platform; while a handful of \xe2\x80\x99prentices, despising the slack\r\nentertainment of guerilla stone-throwing, were having a private\r\nconcentrated match of that favourite Florentine sport at the narrow\r\nentrance of the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Febbrai.\r\n\r\nTito, obliged to make his way through chance openings in the crowd,\r\nfound himself at one moment close to the trotting procession of\r\nbarefooted, hard-heeled contadine, and could see their sun-dried,\r\nbronzed faces, and their strange, fragmentary garb, dim with hereditary\r\ndirt, and of obsolete stuffs and fashions, that made them look, in the\r\neyes of the city people, like a way-worn ancestry returning from a\r\npilgrimage on which they had set out a century ago. Just then it was\r\nthe hardy, scant-feeding peasant-women from the mountains of Pistoia,\r\nwho were entering with a year\xe2\x80\x99s labour in a moderate bundle of yarn on\r\ntheir backs, and in their hearts that meagre hope of good and that wide\r\ndim fear of harm, which were somehow to be cared for by the Blessed\r\nVirgin, whose miraculous image, painted by the angels, was to have the\r\ncurtain drawn away from it on this Eve of her Nativity, that its\r\npotency might stream forth without obstruction.\r\n\r\nAt another moment he was forced away towards the boundary of the\r\npiazza, where the more stationary candidates for attention and small\r\ncoin had judiciously placed themselves, in order to be safe in their\r\nrear. Among these Tito recognised his acquaintance Bratti, who stood\r\nwith his back against a pillar, and his mouth pursed up in disdainful\r\nsilence, eyeing every one who approached him with a cold glance of\r\nsuperiority, and keeping his hand fast on a serge covering which\r\nconcealed the contents of the basket slung before him. Rather surprised\r\nat a deportment so unusual in an anxious trader, Tito went nearer and\r\nsaw two women go up to Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s basket with a look of curiosity,\r\nwhereupon the pedlar drew the covering tighter, and looked another way.\r\nIt was quite too provoking, and one of the women was fain to ask what\r\nthere was in his basket?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I answer that, Monna, I must know whether you mean to buy. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t show such wares as mine in this fair for every fly to settle on\r\nand pay nothing. My goods are a little too choice for that. Besides,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve only two left, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve no mind to soil them; for with the chances\r\nof the pestilence that wise men talk of, there is likelihood of their\r\nbeing worth their weight in gold. No, no: _andate con Dio_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two women looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may be the price?\xe2\x80\x9d said the second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot within what you are likely to have in your purse, buona donna,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bratti, in a compassionately supercilious tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI recommend you\r\nto trust in Messer Domeneddio and the saints: poor people can do no\r\nbetter for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so poor!\xe2\x80\x9d said the second woman, indignantly, drawing out her\r\nmoney-bag. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, now! what do you say to a grosso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say you may get twenty-one quattrini for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, coolly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut not of me, for I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got that small change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome; two, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, getting exasperated, while her\r\ncompanion looked at her with some envy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will hardly be above two, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter further bidding, and further mercantile coquetry, Bratti put on\r\nan air of concession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you\xe2\x80\x99ve set your mind on it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, slowly raising the cover,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be loth to do you a mischief; for Maestro Gabbadeo used to\r\nsay, when a woman sets her mind on a thing and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get it, she\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nworse danger of the pestilence than before. Ecco! I have but two left;\r\nand let me tell you, the fellow to them is on the finger of Maestro\r\nGabbadeo, who is gone to Bologna\xe2\x80\x94as wise a doctor as sits at any door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe precious objects were two clumsy iron rings, beaten into the\r\nfashion of old Roman rings, such as were sometimes disinterred. The\r\nrust on them, and the entirely hidden character of their potency, were\r\nso satisfactory, that the grossi were paid without grumbling, and the\r\nfirst woman, destitute of those handsome coins, succeeded after much\r\nshow of reluctance on Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s part in driving a bargain with some of\r\nher yarn, and carried off the remaining ring in triumph. Bratti covered\r\nup his basket, which was now filled with miscellanies, probably\r\nobtained under the same sort of circumstances as the yarn, and, moving\r\nfrom his pillar, came suddenly upon Tito, who, if he had had time,\r\nwould have chosen to avoid recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the head of San Giovanni, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, drawing Tito back to\r\nthe pillar, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a piece of luck. For I was talking of you this\r\nmorning, Messer Greco; but, I said, he is mounted up among the signori\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it, for I was at the bottom of his fortune\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\ncan rarely get speech of him, for he\xe2\x80\x99s not to be caught lying on the\r\nstones now\xe2\x80\x94not he! But it\xe2\x80\x99s your luck, not mine, Messer Greco, save and\r\nexcept some small trifle to satisfy me for my trouble in the\r\ntransaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak in riddles, Bratti,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, I don\xe2\x80\x99t sharpen\r\nmy wits, as you do, by driving hard bargains for iron rings: you must\r\nbe plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Holy \xe2\x80\x99Vangels! it was an easy bargain I gave them. If a Hebrew\r\ngets thirty-two per cent, I hope a Christian may get a little more. If\r\nI had not borne a conscience, I should have got twice the money and\r\ntwice the yarn. But, talking of rings, it is your ring\xe2\x80\x94that very ring\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got on your finger\xe2\x80\x94that I could get you a purchaser for; ay, and\r\na purchaser with a deep money-bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, looking at his ring and listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Genoese who is going straight away into Hungary, as I understand. He\r\ncame and looked all over my shop to see if I had any old things I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know the price of; I warrant you, he thought I had a pumpkin on\r\nmy shoulders. He had been rummaging all the shops in Florence. And he\r\nhad a ring on\xe2\x80\x94not like yours, but something of the same fashion; and as\r\nhe was talking of rings, I said I knew a fine young man, a particular\r\nacquaintance of mine, who had a ring of that sort. And he said, \xe2\x80\x98Who is\r\nhe, pray? Tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him his price for it.\xe2\x80\x99 And I thought of\r\ngoing after you to Nello\xe2\x80\x99s to-morrow; for it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion of you,\r\nMesser Greco, that you\xe2\x80\x99re not one who\xe2\x80\x99d see the Arno run broth, and\r\nstand by without dipping your finger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito had lost no word of what Bratti had said, yet his mind had been\r\nvery busy all the while. Why should he keep the ring? It had been a\r\nmere sentiment, a mere fancy, that had prevented him from selling it\r\nwith the other gems; if he had been wiser and had sold it, he might\r\nperhaps have escaped that identification by Fra Luca. It was true that\r\nit had been taken from Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s finger and put on his own as soon\r\nas his young hand had grown to the needful size; but there was really\r\nno valid good to anybody in those superstitious scruples about\r\ninanimate objects. The ring had helped towards the recognition of him.\r\nTito had begun to dislike recognition, which was a claim from the past.\r\nThis foreigner\xe2\x80\x99s offer, if he would really give a good price, was an\r\nopportunity for getting rid of the ring without the trouble of seeking\r\na purchaser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak with your usual wisdom, Bratti,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\r\nobjection to hear what your Genoese will offer. But when and where\r\nshall I have speech of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, at three hours after sunrise, he will be at my shop, and if\r\nyour wits are of that sharpness I have always taken them to be, Messer\r\nGreco, you will ask him a heavy price; for he minds not money. It\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbelief he\xe2\x80\x99s buying for somebody else, and not for himself\xe2\x80\x94perhaps for\r\nsome great signor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cI will be at your shop, if nothing hinders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will doubtless deal nobly by me for old acquaintance\xe2\x80\x99 sake,\r\nMesser Greco, so I will not stay to fix the small sum you will give me\r\nin token of my service in the matter. It seems to me a thousand years\r\nnow till I get out of the piazza, for a fair is a dull, not to say a\r\nwicked thing, when one has no more goods to sell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito made a hasty sign of assent and adieu, and moving away from the\r\npillar, again found himself pushed towards the middle of the piazza and\r\nback again, without the power of determining his own course. In this\r\nzigzag way he was carried along to the end of the piazza opposite the\r\nchurch, where, in a deep recess formed by an irregularity in the line\r\nof houses, an entertainment was going forward which seemed to be\r\nespecially attractive to the crowd. Loud bursts of laughter interrupted\r\na monologue which was sometimes slow and oratorical, at others rattling\r\nand buffoonish. Here a girl was being pushed forward into the inner\r\ncircle with apparent reluctance, and there a loud laughing minx was\r\nfinding a way with her own elbows. It was a strange light that was\r\nspread over the piazza. There were the pale stars breaking out above,\r\nand the dim waving lanterns below, leaving all objects indistinct\r\nexcept when they were seen close under the fitfully moving lights; but\r\nin this recess there was a stronger light, against which the heads of\r\nthe encircling spectators stood in dark relief as Tito was gradually\r\npushed towards them, while above them rose the head of a man wearing a\r\nwhite mitre with yellow cabalistic figures upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold, my children!\xe2\x80\x9d Tito heard him saying, \xe2\x80\x9cbehold your opportunity!\r\nneglect not the holy sacrament of matrimony when it can be had for the\r\nsmall sum of a white quattrino\xe2\x80\x94the cheapest matrimony ever offered, and\r\ndissolved by special bull beforehand at every man\xe2\x80\x99s own will and\r\npleasure. Behold the bull!\xe2\x80\x9d Here the speaker held up a piece of\r\nparchment with huge seals attached to it. \xe2\x80\x9cBehold the indulgence\r\ngranted by his Holiness Alexander the Sixth, who, being newly elected\r\nPope for his peculiar piety, intends to reform and purify the Church,\r\nand wisely begins by abolishing that priestly abuse which keeps too\r\nlarge a share of this privileged matrimony to the clergy and stints the\r\nlaity. Spit once, my sons, and pay a white quattrino! This is the whole\r\nand sole price of the indulgence. The quattrino is the only difference\r\nthe Holy Father allows to be put any longer between us and the\r\nclergy\xe2\x80\x94who spit and pay nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito thought he knew the voice, which had a peculiarly sharp ring, but\r\nthe face was too much in shadow from the lights behind for him to be\r\nsure of the features. Stepping as near as he could, he saw within the\r\ncircle behind the speaker an altar-like table raised on a small\r\nplatform, and covered with a red drapery stitched all over with yellow\r\ncabalistical figures. Half-a-dozen thin tapers burned at the back of\r\nthis table, which had a conjuring apparatus scattered over it, a large\r\nopen book in the centre, and at one of the front angles a monkey\r\nfastened by a cord to a small ring and holding a small taper, which in\r\nhis incessant fidgety movements fell more or less aslant, whilst an\r\nimpish boy in a white surplice occupied himself chiefly in cuffing the\r\nmonkey, and adjusting the taper. The man in the mitre also wore a\r\nsurplice, and over it a chasuble on which the signs of the zodiac were\r\nrudely marked in black upon a yellow ground. Tito was sure now that he\r\nrecognised the sharp upward-tending angles of the face under the mitre:\r\nit was that of Maestro Vaiano, the mountebank, from whom he had rescued\r\nTessa. Pretty little Tessa! Perhaps she too had come in among the\r\ntroops of contadine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my maidens! This is the time for the pretty who can have many\r\nchances, and for the ill-favoured who have few. Matrimony to be\r\nhad\xe2\x80\x94hot, eaten, and done with as easily as _berlingozzi_! And see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhere the conjuror held up a cluster of tiny bags. \xe2\x80\x9cTo every bride I\r\ngive a _Breve_ with a secret in it\xe2\x80\x94the secret alone worth the money you\r\npay for the matrimony. The secret how to\xe2\x80\x94no, no, I will not tell you\r\nwhat the secret is about, and that makes it a double secret. Hang it\r\nround your neck if you like, and never look at it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t say _that_\r\nwill not be the best, for then you will see many things you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect: though if you open it you may break your leg, _\xc3\xa8 vero_, but you\r\nwill know a secret! Something nobody knows but me! And mark\xe2\x80\x94I give you\r\nthe _Breve_, I don\xe2\x80\x99t sell it, as many another holy man would: the\r\nquattrino is for the matrimony, and the _Breve_ you get for nothing.\r\n_Ors\xc3\xb9, giovanetti_, come like dutiful sons of the Church and buy the\r\nIndulgence of his Holiness Alexander the Sixth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis buffoonery just fitted the taste of the audience; the _fierucola_\r\nwas but a small occasion, so the townsmen might be contented with jokes\r\nthat were rather less indecent than those they were accustomed to hear\r\nat every carnival, put into easy rhyme by the Magnifico and his poetic\r\nsatellites; while the women, over and above any relish of the fun,\r\nreally began to have an itch for the _Brevi_. Several couples had\r\nalready gone through the ceremony, in which the conjuror\xe2\x80\x99s solemn\r\ngibberish and grimaces over the open book, the antics of the monkey,\r\nand even the preliminary spitting, had called forth peals of laughter;\r\nand now a well-looking, merry-eyed youth of seventeen, in a loose tunic\r\nand red cap, pushed forward, holding by the hand a plump brunette,\r\nwhose scanty ragged dress displayed her round arms and legs very\r\npicturesquely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetter us without delay, Maestro!\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have got to\r\ntake my bride home and paint her under the light of a lantern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! Mariotto, my son, I commend your pious observance...\xe2\x80\x9d The conjuror\r\nwas going on, when a loud chattering behind warned him that an\r\nunpleasant crisis had arisen with his monkey.\r\n\r\nThe temper of that imperfect acolyth was a little tried by the\r\nover-active discipline of his colleague in the surplice, and a sudden\r\ncuff administered as his taper fell to a horizontal position, caused\r\nhim to leap back with a violence that proved too much for the slackened\r\nknot by which his cord was fastened. His first leap was to the other\r\nend of the table, from which position his remonstrances were so\r\nthreatening that the imp in the surplice took up a wand by way of an\r\nequivalent threat, whereupon the monkey leaped on to the head of a tall\r\nwoman in the foreground, dropping his taper by the way, and chattering\r\nwith increased emphasis from that eminence. Great was the screaming and\r\nconfusion, not a few of the spectators having a vague dread of the\r\nMaestro\xe2\x80\x99s monkey, as capable of more hidden mischief than mere teeth\r\nand claws could inflict; and the conjuror himself was in some alarm\r\nlest any harm should happen to his familiar. In the scuffle to seize\r\nthe monkey\xe2\x80\x99s string, Tito got out of the circle, and, not caring to\r\ncontend for his place again, he allowed himself to be gradually pushed\r\ntowards the church of the Nunziata, and to enter amongst the\r\nworshippers.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant illumination within seemed to press upon his eyes with\r\npalpable force after the pale scattered lights and broad shadows of the\r\npiazza, and for the first minute or two he could see nothing\r\ndistinctly. That yellow splendour was in itself something supernatural\r\nand heavenly to many of the peasant-women, for whom half the sky was\r\nhidden by mountains, and who went to bed in the twilight; and the\r\nuninterrupted chant from the choir was repose to the ear after the\r\nhellish hubbub of the crowd outside. Gradually the scene became\r\nclearer, though still there was a thin yellow haze from incense\r\nmingling with the breath of the multitude. In a chapel on the left-hand\r\nof the nave, wreathed with silver lamps, was seen unveiled the\r\nmiraculous fresco of the Annunciation, which, in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s oblique view of\r\nit from the right-hand side of the nave, seemed dark with the excess of\r\nlight around it. The whole area of the great church was filled with\r\npeasant-women, some kneeling, some standing; the coarse bronzed skins,\r\nand the dingy clothing of the rougher dwellers on the mountains,\r\ncontrasting with the softer-lined faces and white or red head-drapery\r\nof the well-to-do dwellers in the valley, who were scattered in\r\nirregular groups. And spreading high and far over the walls and ceiling\r\nthere was another multitude, also pressing close against each other,\r\nthat they might be nearer the potent Virgin. It was the crowd of votive\r\nwaxen images, the effigies of great personages, clothed in their habit\r\nas they lived: Florentines of high name in their black silk lucco, as\r\nwhen they sat in council; popes, emperors, kings, cardinals, and famous\r\ncondottieri with plumed morion seated on their chargers; all notable\r\nstrangers who passed through Florence or had aught to do with its\r\naffairs\xe2\x80\x94Mohammedans, even, in well-tolerated companionship with\r\nChristian cavaliers; some of them with faces blackened and robes\r\ntattered by the corroding breath of centuries, others fresh and bright\r\nin new red mantle or steel corselet, the exact doubles of the living.\r\nAnd wedged in with all these were detached arms, legs, and other\r\nmembers, with only here and there a gap where some image had been\r\nremoved for public disgrace, or had fallen ominously, as Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s had\r\ndone six months before. It was a perfect resurrection-swarm of remote\r\nmortals and fragments of mortals, reflecting, in their varying degrees\r\nof freshness, the sombre dinginess and sprinkled brightness of the\r\ncrowd below.\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s glance wandered over the wild multitude in search of something.\r\nHe had already thought of Tessa, and the white hoods suggested the\r\npossibility that he might detect her face under one of them. It was at\r\nleast a thought to be courted, rather than the vision of Romola looking\r\nat him with changed eyes. But he searched in vain; and he was leaving\r\nthe church, weary of a scene which had no variety, when, just against\r\nthe doorway, he caught sight of Tessa, only two yards off him. She was\r\nkneeling with her back against the wall, behind a group of\r\npeasant-women, who were standing and looking for a spot nearer to the\r\nsacred image. Her head hung a little aside with a look of weariness,\r\nand her blue eyes were directed rather absently towards an altar-piece\r\nwhere the Archangel Michael stood in his armour, with young face and\r\nfloating hair, amongst bearded and tonsured saints. Her right-hand,\r\nholding a bunch of cocoons, fell by her side listlessly, and her round\r\ncheek was paled, either by the light or by the weariness that was\r\nexpressed in her attitude: her lips were pressed poutingly together,\r\nand every now and then her eyelids half fell: she was a large image of\r\na sweet sleepy child. Tito felt an irresistible desire to go up to her\r\nand get her pretty trusting looks and prattle: this creature who was\r\nwithout moral judgment that could condemn him, whose little loving\r\nignorant soul made a world apart, where he might feel in freedom from\r\nsuspicions and exacting demands, had a new attraction for him now. She\r\nseemed a refuge from the threatened isolation that would come with\r\ndisgrace. He glanced cautiously round, to assure himself that Monna\r\nGhita was not near, and then, slipping quietly to her side, kneeled on\r\none knee, and said, in the softest voice, \xe2\x80\x9cTessa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hardly started, any more than she would have started at a soft\r\nbreeze that fanned her gently when she was needing it. She turned her\r\nhead and saw Tito\xe2\x80\x99s face close to her: it was very much more beautiful\r\nthan the Archangel Michael\xe2\x80\x99s, who was so mighty and so good that he\r\nlived with the Madonna and all the saints and was prayed to along with\r\nthem. She smiled in happy silence, for that nearness of Tito quite\r\nfilled her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little Tessa! you look very tired. How long have you been kneeling\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be collecting her thoughts for a minute or two, and at\r\nlast she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then; come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lifted her from her knees, and led her out under the cloisters\r\nsurrounding the atrium, which were then open, and not yet adorned with\r\nthe frescoes of Andrea del Sarto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you are all by yourself, and so hungry, Tessa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Madre is ill; she has very bad pains in her legs, and sent me to\r\nbring these cocoons to the Santissima Nunziata, because they\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nwonderful; see!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she held up the bunch of cocoons, which were arranged\r\nwith fortuitous regularity on a stem,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand she had kept them to bring\r\nthem herself, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and so she sent me because she thinks\r\nthe Holy Madonna may take away her pains; and somebody took my bag with\r\nthe bread and chestnuts in it, and the people pushed me back, and I was\r\nso frightened coming in the crowd, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere near the\r\nHoly Madonna, to give the cocoons to the Padre, but I must\xe2\x80\x94oh, I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my little Tessa, you shall take them; but first come and let me\r\ngive you some berlingozzi. There are some to be had not far off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, a little bewildered. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nyou would never come to me again, because you never came to the Mercato\r\nfor milk any more. I set myself Aves to say, to see if they would bring\r\nyou back, but I left off, because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I come when you want some one to take care of you, Tessa.\r\nPerhaps the Aves fetched me, only it took them a long while. But what\r\nshall you do if you are here all alone? Where shall you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall stay and sleep in the church\xe2\x80\x94a great many of them do\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe church and all about here\xe2\x80\x94I did once when I came with my mother;\r\nand the _patrigno_ is coming with the mules in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were out in the piazza now, where the crowd was rather less\r\nriotous than before, and the lights were fewer, the stream of pilgrims\r\nhaving ceased. Tessa clung fast to Tito\xe2\x80\x99s arm in satisfied silence,\r\nwhile he led her towards the stall where he remembered seeing the\r\neatables. Their way was the easier because there was just now a great\r\nrush towards the middle of the piazza, where the masqued figures on\r\nstilts had found space to execute a dance. It was very pretty to see\r\nthe guileless thing giving her cocoons into Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and then\r\neating her berlingozzi with the relish of a hungry child. Tito had\r\nreally come to take care of her, as he did before, and that wonderful\r\nhappiness of being with him had begun again for her. Her hunger was\r\nsoon appeased, all the sooner for the new stimulus of happiness that\r\nhad roused her from her languor, and, as they turned away from the\r\nstall, she said nothing about going into the church again, but looked\r\nround as if the sights in the piazza were not without attraction to her\r\nnow she was safe under Tito\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can they do that?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, looking up at the dancers on\r\nstilts. Then, after a minute\xe2\x80\x99s silence, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Saint Christopher\r\nhelps them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. What do you think about it, Tessa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, slipping his\r\nright arm round her, and looking down at her fondly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Saint Christopher is so very tall; and he is very good: if\r\nanybody looks at him he takes care of them all day. He is on the wall\r\nof the church\xe2\x80\x94too tall to stand up there\xe2\x80\x94but I saw him walking through\r\nthe streets one San Giovanni, carrying the little Gesu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pretty pigeon! Do you think anybody could help taking care of\r\n_you_, if you looked at them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you always come and take care of me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, turning her\r\nface up to him, as he crushed her cheek with his left-hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall\r\nyou always be a long while first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito was conscious that some bystanders were laughing at them, and\r\nthough the licence of street fun, among artists and young men of the\r\nwealthier sort as well as among the populace, made few adventures\r\nexceptional, still less disreputable, he chose to move away towards the\r\nend of the piazza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I shall come again to you very soon, Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered,\r\nrather dreamily, when they had moved away. He was thinking that when\r\nall the rest had turned their backs upon him, it would be pleasant to\r\nhave this little creature adoring him and nestling against him. The\r\nabsence of presumptuous self-conceit in Tito made him feel all the more\r\ndefenceless under prospective obloquy: he needed soft looks and\r\ncaresses too much ever to be impudent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Mercato?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa. \xe2\x80\x9cNot to-morrow morning, because the\r\n_patrigno_ will be there, and he is so cross. Oh! but you have money,\r\nand he will not be cross if you buy some salad. And there are some\r\nchestnuts. Do you like chestnuts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, but continued to look down at her with a dreamy\r\ngentleness, and Tessa felt herself in a state of delicious wonder;\r\neverything seemed as new as if she were being carried on a chariot of\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed again presently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a holy father\r\nlike the Bishop I saw at Prato.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito looked up too, and saw that he had unconsciously advanced to\r\nwithin a few yards of the conjuror, Maestro Vaiano, who for the moment\r\nwas forsaken by the crowd. His face was turned away from them, and he\r\nwas occupied with the apparatus on his altar or table, preparing a new\r\ndiversion by the time the interest in the dancing should be exhausted.\r\nThe monkey was imprisoned under the red cloth, out of reach of\r\nmischief, and the youngster in the white surplice was holding a sort of\r\ndish or salver, from which his master was taking some ingredient. The\r\naltar-like table, with its gorgeous cloth, the row of tapers, the sham\r\nepiscopal costume, the surpliced attendant, and even the movements of\r\nthe mitred figure, as he alternately bent his head and then raised\r\nsomething before the lights, were a sufficiently near parody of sacred\r\nthings to rouse poor little Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s veneration; and there was some\r\nadditional awe produced by the mystery of their apparition in this\r\nspot, for when she had seen an altar in the street before, it had been\r\non Corpus Christi Day, and there had been a procession to account for\r\nit. She crossed herself and looked up at Tito, but then, as if she had\r\nhad time for reflection, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because of the Nativita.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Vaiano had turned round, raising his hands to his mitre with\r\nthe intention of changing his dress, when his quick eye recognised Tito\r\nand Tessa who were both looking at him, their faces being shone upon by\r\nthe light of his tapers, while his own was in shadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! my children!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, instantly, stretching out his hands in a\r\nbenedictory attitude, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are come to be married. I commend your\r\npenitence\xe2\x80\x94the blessing of Holy Church can never come too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut whilst he was speaking, he had taken in the whole meaning of\r\nTessa\xe2\x80\x99s attitude and expression, and he discerned an opportunity for a\r\nnew kind of joke which required him to be cautious and solemn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like to be married to me, Tessa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, softly, half\r\nenjoying the comedy, as he saw the pretty childish seriousness on her\r\nface, half prompted by hazy previsions which belonged to the\r\nintoxication of despair.\r\n\r\nHe felt her vibrating before she looked up at him and said, timidly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered only by a smile, and by leading her forward in front of the\r\n_cerretano_, who, seeing an excellent jest in Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s evident delusion,\r\nassumed a surpassing sacerdotal solemnity, and went through the mimic\r\nceremony with a liberal expenditure of _lingua furbesca_ or thieves\xe2\x80\x99\r\nLatin. But some symptoms of a new movement in the crowd urged him to\r\nbring it to a speedy conclusion and dismiss them with hands\r\noutstretched in a benedictory attitude over their kneeling figures.\r\nTito, disposed always to cultivate goodwill, though it might be the\r\nleast select, put a piece of four grossi into his hand as he moved\r\naway, and was thanked by a look which, the conjuror felt sure, conveyed\r\na perfect understanding of the whole affair.\r\n\r\nBut Tito himself was very far from that understanding, and did not, in\r\nfact, know whether, the next moment, he should tell Tessa of the joke\r\nand laugh at her for a little goose, or whether he should let her\r\ndelusion last, and see what would come of it\xe2\x80\x94see what she would say and\r\ndo next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will not go away from me again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, after they had\r\nwalked a few steps, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will take me to where you live.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke\r\nmeditatively, and not in a questioning tone. But presently she added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go back once to the Madre though, to tell her I brought the\r\ncocoons, and that I am married, and shall not go back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito felt the necessity of speaking now; and in the rapid thought\r\nprompted by that necessity, he saw that by undeceiving Tessa he should\r\nbe robbing himself of some at least of that pretty trustfulness which\r\nmight, by-and-by, be his only haven from contempt. It would spoil Tessa\r\nto make her the least particle wiser or more suspicious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my little Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, caressingly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must go back to the\r\nMadre; but you must not tell her you are married\xe2\x80\x94you must keep that a\r\nsecret from everybody; else some very great harm would happen to me,\r\nand you would never see me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with fear in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go back and feed your goats and mules, and do just as you\r\nhave always done before, and say no word to any one about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe corners of her mouth fell a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, perhaps, I shall come and take care of you again when you\r\nwant me, as I did before. But you must do just what I tell you, else\r\nyou will not see me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a loud whisper, frightened at that\r\nblank prospect.\r\n\r\nThey were silent a little while; and then Tessa, looking at her hand,\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Madre wears a betrothal ring. She went to church and had it put\r\non, and then after that, another day, she was married. And so did the\r\ncousin Nannina. But then _she_ married Gollo,\xe2\x80\x9d added the poor little\r\nthing, entangled in the difficult comparison between her own case and\r\nothers within her experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must not wear a betrothal ring, my Tessa, because no one must\r\nknow you are married,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, feeling some insistence necessary.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the _buona fortuna_ that I gave you did just as well for\r\nbetrothal. Some people are betrothed with rings and some are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is true, they would see the ring,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, trying to\r\nconvince herself that a thing she would like very much was really not\r\ngood for her.\r\n\r\nThey were now near the entrance of the church again, and she remembered\r\nher cocoons which were still in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you must give me the _boto_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand we must go in, and I\r\nmust take it to the Padre, and I must tell the rest of my beads,\r\nbecause I was too tired before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must go in, Tessa; but I will not go in. I must leave you\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, too feverish and weary to re-enter that stifling heat,\r\nand feeling that this was the least difficult way of parting with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not come back? Oh, where do you go?\xe2\x80\x9d Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s mind had never formed\r\nan image of his whereabout or his doings when she did not see him: he\r\nhad vanished, and her thought, instead of following him, had stayed in\r\nthe same spot where he was with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come back some time, Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, taking her under the\r\ncloisters to the door of the church. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not cry\xe2\x80\x94you must go to\r\nsleep, when you have said your beads. And here is money to buy your\r\nbreakfast. Now kiss me, and look happy, else I shall not come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a great effort over herself as she put up her lips to kiss\r\nhim, and submitted to be gently turned round, with her face towards the\r\ndoor of the church. Tito saw her enter; and then with a shrug at his\r\nown resolution, leaned against a pillar, took off his cap, rubbed his\r\nhair backward, and wondered where Romola was now, and what she was\r\nthinking of him. Poor little Tessa had disappeared behind the curtain\r\namong the crowd of peasants; but the love which formed one web with all\r\nhis worldly hopes, with the ambitions and pleasures that must make the\r\nsolid part of his days\xe2\x80\x94the love that was identified with his larger\r\nself\xe2\x80\x94was not to be banished from his consciousness. Even to the man who\r\npresents the most elastic resistance to whatever is unpleasant, there\r\nwill come moments when the pressure from without is too strong for him,\r\nand he must feel the smart and the bruise in spite of himself. Such a\r\nmoment had come to Tito. There was no possible attitude of mind, no\r\nscheme of action by which the uprooting of all his newly-planted hopes\r\ncould be made otherwise than painful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nThe Dying Message.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Romola arrived at the entrance of San Marco she found one of the\r\nFrati waiting there in expectation of her arrival. Monna Brigida\r\nretired into the adjoining church, and Romola was conducted to the door\r\nof the chapter-house in the outer cloister, whither the invalid had\r\nbeen conveyed; no woman being allowed admission beyond this precinct.\r\n\r\nWhen the door opened, the subdued external light blending with that of\r\ntwo tapers placed behind a truckle-bed, showed the emaciated face of\r\nFra Luca, with the tonsured crown of golden hair above it, and with\r\ndeep-sunken hazel eyes fixed on a small crucifix which he held before\r\nhim. He was propped up into nearly a sitting posture; and Romola was\r\njust conscious, as she threw aside her veil, that there was another\r\nmonk standing by the bed, with the black cowl drawn over his head, and\r\nthat he moved towards the door as she entered; just conscious that in\r\nthe background there was a crucified form rising high and pale on the\r\nfrescoed wall, and pale faces of sorrow looking out from it below.\r\n\r\nThe next moment her eyes met Fra Luca\xe2\x80\x99s as they looked up at her from\r\nthe crucifix, and she was absorbed in that pang of recognition which\r\nidentified this monkish emaciated form with the image of her fair young\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDino!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice like a low cry of pain. But she did not\r\nbend towards him; she held herself erect, and paused at two yards\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndistance from him. There was an unconquerable repulsion for her in that\r\nmonkish aspect; it seemed to her the brand of the dastardly\r\nundutifulness which had left her father desolate\xe2\x80\x94of the grovelling\r\nsuperstition which could give such undutifulness the name of piety. Her\r\nfather, whose proud sincerity and simplicity of life had made him one\r\nof the few frank pagans of his time, had brought her up with a silent\r\nignoring of any claims the Church could have to regulate the belief and\r\naction of beings with a cultivated reason. The Church, in her mind,\r\nbelonged to that actual life of the mixed multitude from which they had\r\nalways lived apart, and she had no ideas that could render her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s course an object of any other feeling than incurious,\r\nindignant contempt. Yet the lovingness of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s soul had clung to\r\nthat image in the past, and while she stood rigidly aloof, there was a\r\nyearning search in her eyes for something too faintly discernible.\r\n\r\nBut there was no corresponding emotion in the face of the monk. He\r\nlooked at the little sister returned to him in her full womanly beauty,\r\nwith the far-off gaze of a revisiting spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a feeble and interrupted but yet distinct\r\nutterance, \xe2\x80\x9cit is well thou hast not longer delayed to come, for I have\r\na message to deliver to thee, and my time is short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola took a step nearer: the message, she thought, would be one of\r\naffectionate penitence to her father, and her heart began to open.\r\nNothing could wipe out the long years of desertion; but the culprit,\r\nlooking back on those years with the sense of irremediable wrong\r\ncommitted, would call forth pity. Now, at the last, there would be\r\nunderstanding and forgiveness. Dino would pour out some natural filial\r\nfeeling; he would ask questions about his father\xe2\x80\x99s blindness\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nrapidly it had come on? how the long dark days had been filled? what\r\nthe life was now in the home where he himself had been nourished?\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe last message from the dying lips would be one of tenderness and\r\nregret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola,\xe2\x80\x9d Fra Luca began, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a vision concerning thee. Thrice\r\nI have had it in the last two months: each time it has been clearer.\r\nTherefore I came from Fiesole, deeming it a message from heaven that I\r\nwas bound to deliver. And I gather a promise of mercy to thee in this,\r\nthat my breath is preserved in order to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe difficult breathing which continually interrupted him would not let\r\nhim finish the sentence.\r\n\r\nRomola had felt her heart chilling again. It was a vision, then, this\r\nmessage\xe2\x80\x94one of those visions she had so often heard her father allude\r\nto with bitterness. Her indignation rushed to her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDino, I thought you had some words to send to my father. You forsook\r\nhim when his sight was failing; you made his life very desolate. Have\r\nyou never cared about that? never repented? What is this religion of\r\nyours, that places visions before natural duties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deep-sunken hazel eyes turned slowly towards her, and rested upon\r\nher in silence for some moments, as if he were meditating whether he\r\nshould answer her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last; speaking as before, in a low passionless tone,\r\nas of some spirit not human, speaking through dying human organs. \xe2\x80\x9cNo;\r\nI have never repented fleeing from the stifling poison-breath of sin\r\nthat was hot and thick around me, and threatened to steal over my\r\nsenses like besotting wine. My father could not hear the voice that\r\ncalled me night and day; he knew nothing of the demon-tempters that\r\ntried to drag me back from following it. My father has lived amidst\r\nhuman sin and misery without believing in them: he has been like one\r\nbusy picking shining stones in a mine, while there was a world dying of\r\nplague above him. I spoke, but he listened with scorn. I told him the\r\nstudies he wished me to live for were either childish trifling\xe2\x80\x94dead\r\ntoys\xe2\x80\x94or else they must be made warm and living by pulses that beat to\r\nworldly ambitions and fleshly lusts, for worldly ambitions and fleshly\r\nlusts made all the substance of the poetry and history he wanted me to\r\nbend my eyes on continually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas not my father led a pure and noble life, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Romola burst\r\nforth, unable to hear in silence this implied accusation against her\r\nfather. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has sought no worldly honours; he has been truthful; he has\r\ndenied himself all luxuries; he has lived like one of the ancient\r\nsages. He never wished you to live for worldly ambitions and fleshly\r\nlusts; he wished you to live as he himself has done, according to the\r\npurest maxims of philosophy, in which he brought you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola spoke partly by rote, as all ardent and sympathetic young\r\ncreatures do; but she spoke with intense belief. The pink flush was in\r\nher face, and she quivered from head to foot. Her brother was again\r\nslow to answer; looking at her passionate face with strange passionless\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were the maxims of philosophy to me? They told me to be strong,\r\nwhen I felt myself weak; when I was ready, like the blessed Saint\r\nBenedict, to roll myself among thorns, and court smarting wounds as a\r\ndeliverance from temptation. For the Divine love had sought me, and\r\npenetrated me, and created a great need in me; like a seed that wants\r\nroom to grow. I had been brought up in carelessness of the true faith;\r\nI had not studied the doctrines of our religion; but it seemed to take\r\npossession of me like a rising flood. I felt that there was a life of\r\nperfect love and purity for the soul; in which there would be no uneasy\r\nhunger after pleasure, no tormenting questions, no fear of suffering.\r\nBefore I knew the history of the saints, I had a foreshadowing of their\r\necstasy. For the same truth had penetrated even into pagan philosophy:\r\nthat it is a bliss within the reach of man to die to mortal needs, and\r\nlive in the life of God as the Unseen Perfectness. But to attain that I\r\nmust forsake the world: I must have no affection, no hope, wedding me\r\nto that which passeth away; I must live with my fellow-beings only as\r\nhuman souls related to the eternal unseen life. That need was urging me\r\ncontinually: it came over me in visions when my mind fell away weary\r\nfrom the vain words which record the passions of dead men: it came over\r\nme after I had been tempted into sin and had turned away with loathing\r\nfrom the scent of the emptied cup. And in visions I saw the meaning of\r\nthe Crucifix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, breathing hard for a minute or two: but Romola was not\r\nprompted to speak again. It was useless for her mind to attempt any\r\ncontact with the mind of this unearthly brother: as useless as for her\r\nhand to try and grasp a shadow. When he spoke again his heaving chest\r\nwas quieter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt whom I must follow: but I saw that even among the servants of\r\nthe Cross who professed to have renounced the world, my soul would be\r\nstifled with the fumes of hypocrisy, and lust, and pride. God had not\r\nchosen me, as he chose Saint Dominic and Saint Francis, to wrestle with\r\nevil in the Church and in the world. He called upon me to flee: I took\r\nthe sacred vows and I fled\xe2\x80\x94fled to lands where danger and scorn and\r\nwant bore me continually, like angels, to repose on the bosom of God. I\r\nhave lived the life of a hermit, I have ministered to pilgrims; but my\r\ntask has been short: the veil has worn very thin that divides me from\r\nmy everlasting rest. I came back to Florence that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDino, you _did_ want to know if my father was alive,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nRomola, the picture of that suffering life touching her again with the\r\ndesire for union and forgiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94That before I died I might urge others of our brethren to study the\r\nEastern tongues, as I had not done, and go out to greater ends than I\r\ndid; and I find them already bent on the work. And since I came,\r\nRomola, I have felt that I was sent partly to thee\xe2\x80\x94not to renew the\r\nbonds of earthly affection, but to deliver the heavenly warning\r\nconveyed in a vision. For I have had that vision thrice. And through\r\nall the years since first the Divine voice called me, while I was yet\r\nin the world, I have been taught and guided by visions. For in the\r\npainful linking together of our waking thoughts we can never be sure\r\nthat we have not mingled our own error with the light we have prayed\r\nfor; but in visions and dreams we are passive, and our souls are as an\r\ninstrument in the Divine hand. Therefore listen, and speak not\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94for the time is short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s mind recoiled strongly from listening to this vision. Her\r\nindignation had subsided, but it was only because she had felt the\r\ndistance between her brother and herself widening. But while Fra Luca\r\nwas speaking, the figure of another monk had entered, and again stood\r\non the other side of the bed, with the cowl drawn over his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKneel, my daughter, for the Angel of Death is present, and waits while\r\nthe message of heaven is delivered: bend thy pride before it is bent\r\nfor thee by a yoke of iron,\xe2\x80\x9d said a strong rich voice, startlingly in\r\ncontrast with Fra Luca\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe tone was not that of imperious command, but of quiet\r\nself-possession and assurance of the right, blended with benignity.\r\nRomola, vibrating to the sound, looked round at the figure on the\r\nopposite side of the bed. His face was hardly discernible under the\r\nshadow of the cowl, and her eyes fell at once on his hands, which were\r\nfolded across his breast and lay in relief on the edge of his black\r\nmantle. They had a marked physiognomy which enforced the influence of\r\nthe voice: they were very beautiful and almost of transparent delicacy.\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s disposition to rebel against command, doubly active in the\r\npresence of monks, whom she had been taught to despise, would have\r\nfixed itself on any repulsive detail as a point of support. But the\r\nface was hidden, and the hands seemed to have an appeal in them against\r\nall hardness. The next moment the right-hand took the crucifix to\r\nrelieve the fatigued grasp of Fra Luca, and the left touched his lips\r\nwith a wet sponge which lay near. In the act of bending, the cowl was\r\npushed back, and the features of the monk had the full light of the\r\ntapers on them. They were very marked features, such as lend themselves\r\nto popular description. There was the high arched nose, the prominent\r\nunder-lip, the coronet of thick dark hair above the brow, all seeming\r\nto tell of energy and passion; there were the blue-grey eyes, shining\r\nmildly under auburn eyelashes, seeming, like the hands, to tell of\r\nacute sensitiveness. Romola felt certain they were the features of Fra\r\nGirolamo Savonarola, the prior of San Marco, whom she had chiefly\r\nthought of as more offensive than other monks, because he was more\r\nnoisy. Her rebellion was rising against the first impression, which had\r\nalmost forced her to bend her knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKneel, my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d the penetrating voice said again, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pride of\r\nthe body is a barrier against the gifts that purify the soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking at her with mild fixedness while he spoke, and again she\r\nfelt that subtle mysterious influence of a personality by which it has\r\nbeen given to some rare men to move their fellows.\r\n\r\nSlowly Romola fell on her knees, and in the very act a tremor came over\r\nher; in the renunciation of her proud erectness, her mental attitude\r\nseemed changed, and she found herself in a new state of passiveness.\r\nHer brother began to speak again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola, in the deep night, as I lay awake, I saw my father\xe2\x80\x99s room\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlibrary\xe2\x80\x94with all the books and the marbles and the leggio, where I used\r\nto stand and read; and I saw you\xe2\x80\x94you were revealed to me as I see you\r\nnow, with fair long hair, sitting before my father\xe2\x80\x99s chair. And at the\r\nleggio stood a man whose face I could not see. I looked, and looked,\r\nand it was a blank to me, even as a painting effaced; and I saw him\r\nmove and take thee, Romola, by the hand; and then I saw thee take my\r\nfather by the hand; and you all three went down the stone steps into\r\nthe streets, the man whose face was a blank to me leading the way. And\r\nyou stood at the altar in Santa Croce, and the priest who married you\r\nhad the face of death; and the graves opened, and the dead in their\r\nshrouds rose and followed you like a bridal train. And you passed on\r\nthrough the streets and the gates into the valley, and it seemed to me\r\nthat he who led you hurried you more than you could bear, and the dead\r\nwere weary of following you, and turned back to their graves. And at\r\nlast you came to a stony place where there was no water, and no trees\r\nor herbage; but instead of water, I saw written parchment unrolling\r\nitself everywhere, and instead of trees and herbage I saw men of bronze\r\nand marble springing up and crowding round you. And my father was faint\r\nfor want of water and fell to the ground; and the man whose face was a\r\nblank loosed thy hand and departed: and as he went I could see his\r\nface; and it was the face of the Great Tempter. And thou, Romola, didst\r\nwring thy hands and seek for water, and there was none. And the bronze\r\nand marble figures seemed to mock thee and hold out cups of water, and\r\nwhen thou didst grasp them and put them to my father\xe2\x80\x99s lips, they\r\nturned to parchment. And the bronze and marble figures seemed to turn\r\ninto demons and snatch my father\xe2\x80\x99s body from thee, and the parchments\r\nshrivelled up, and blood ran everywhere instead of them, and fire upon\r\nthe blood, till they all vanished, and the plain was bare and stony\r\nagain, and thou wast alone in the midst of it. And then it seemed that\r\nthe night fell and I saw no more... Thrice I have had that vision,\r\nRomola. I believe it is a revelation meant for thee: to warn thee\r\nagainst marriage as a temptation of the enemy; it calls upon thee to\r\ndedicate thyself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis pauses had gradually become longer and more frequent, and he was\r\nnow compelled to cease by a severe fit of gasping, in which his eyes\r\nwere turned on the crucifix as on a light that was vanishing. Presently\r\nhe found strength to speak again, but in a feebler, scarcely audible\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo renounce the vain philosophy and corrupt thoughts of the heathens:\r\nfor in the hour of sorrow and death their pride will turn to mockery,\r\nand the unclean gods will\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words died away.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the thought that was at work in Romola, telling her that\r\nthis vision was no more than a dream, fed by youthful memories and\r\nideal convictions, a strange awe had come over her. Her mind was not\r\napt to be assailed by sickly fancies; she had the vivid intellect and\r\nthe healthy human passion, which are too keenly alive to the constant\r\nrelations of things to have any morbid craving after the exceptional.\r\nStill the images of the vision she despised jarred and distressed her\r\nlike painful and cruel cries. And it was the first time she had\r\nwitnessed the struggle with approaching death: her young life had been\r\nsombre, but she had known nothing of the utmost human needs; no acute\r\nsuffering\xe2\x80\x94no heart-cutting sorrow; and this brother, come back to her\r\nin his hour of supreme agony, was like a sudden awful apparition from\r\nan invisible world. The pale faces of sorrow in the fresco on the\r\nopposite wall seemed to have come nearer, and to make one company with\r\nthe pale face on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying voice.\r\n\r\nFra Girolamo leaned down. But no other word came for some moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola,\xe2\x80\x9d it said next.\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward too: but again there was silence. The words were\r\nstruggling in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFra Girolamo, give her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crucifix,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of Fra Girolamo.\r\n\r\nNo other sound came from the dying lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDino!\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, with a low but piercing cry, as the certainty came\r\nupon her that the silence of misunderstanding could never be broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the crucifix, my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fra Girolamo, after a few\r\nminutes. \xe2\x80\x9cHis eyes behold it no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola stretched out her hand to the crucifix, and this act appeared to\r\nrelieve the tension of her mind. A great sob burst from her. She bowed\r\nher head by the side of her dead brother, and wept aloud.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her as if this first vision of death must alter the\r\ndaylight for her for evermore.\r\n\r\nFra Girolamo moved towards the door, and called in a lay Brother who\r\nwas waiting outside. Then he went up to Romola and said in a tone of\r\ngentle command, \xe2\x80\x9cRise, my daughter, and be comforted. Our brother is\r\nwith the blessed. He has left you the crucifix, in remembrance of the\r\nheavenly warning\xe2\x80\x94that it may be a beacon to you in the darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose from her knees, trembling, folded her veil over her head, and\r\nhid the crucifix under her mantle. Fra Girolamo then led the way out\r\ninto the cloistered court, lit now only by the stars and by a lantern\r\nwhich was held by some one near the entrance. Several other figures in\r\nthe dress of the dignified laity were grouped about the same spot. They\r\nwere some of the numerous frequenters of San Marco, who had come to\r\nvisit the Prior, and having heard that he was in attendance on the\r\ndying Brother in the chapter-house, had awaited him here.\r\n\r\nRomola was dimly conscious of footsteps and rustling forms moving\r\naside: she heard the voice of Fra Girolamo saying, in a low tone, \xe2\x80\x9cOur\r\nbrother is departed;\xe2\x80\x9d she felt a hand laid on her arm. The next moment\r\nthe door was opened, and she was out in the wide piazza of San Marco,\r\nwith no one but Monna Brigida, and the servant carrying the lantern.\r\n\r\nThe fresh sense of space revived her, and helped her to recover her\r\nself-mastery. The scene which had just closed upon her was terribly\r\ndistinct and vivid, but it began to narrow under the returning\r\nimpressions of the life that lay outside it. She hastened her steps,\r\nwith nervous anxiety to be again with her father\xe2\x80\x94and with Tito\xe2\x80\x94for were\r\nthey not together in her absence? The images of that vision, while they\r\nclung about her like a hideous dream not yet to be shaken off, made her\r\nyearn all the more for the beloved faces and voices that would assure\r\nher of her waking life.\r\n\r\nTito, we know, was not with Bardo; his destiny was being shaped by a\r\nguilty consciousness, urging on him the despairing belief that by this\r\ntime Romola possessed the knowledge which would lead to their final\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nAnd the lips that could have conveyed that knowledge were for ever\r\nclosed. The prevision that Fra Luca\xe2\x80\x99s words had imparted to Romola had\r\nbeen such as comes from the shadowy region where human souls seek\r\nwisdom apart from the human sympathies which are the very life and\r\nsubstance of our wisdom; the revelation that might have come from the\r\nsimple questions of filial and brotherly affection had been carried\r\ninto irrevocable silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nA Florentine Joke.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Tito was returning from Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s shop in the\r\nnarrow thoroughfare of the Ferravecchi. The Genoese stranger had\r\ncarried away the onyx ring, and Tito was carrying away fifty florins.\r\nIt did just cross his mind that if, after all, Fortune, by one of her\r\nable devices, saved him from the necessity of quitting Florence, it\r\nwould be better for him not to have parted with his ring, since he had\r\nbeen understood to wear it for the sake of peculiar memories and\r\npredilections; still, it was a slight matter, not worth dwelling on\r\nwith any emphasis, and in those moments he had lost his confidence in\r\nfortune. The feverish excitement of the first alarm which had impelled\r\nhis mind to travel into the future had given place to a dull, regretful\r\nlassitude. He cared so much for the pleasures that could only come to\r\nhim through the good opinion of his fellow-men, that he wished now he\r\nhad never risked ignominy by shrinking from what his fellow-men called\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nBut our deeds are like children that are born to us; they live and act\r\napart from our own will. Nay, children may be strangled, but deeds\r\nnever: they have an indestructible life both in and out of our\r\nconsciousness; and that dreadful vitality of deeds was pressing hard on\r\nTito for the first time.\r\n\r\nHe was going back to his lodgings in the Piazza di San Giovanni, but he\r\navoided passing through the Mercato Vecchio, which was his nearest way,\r\nlest he should see Tessa. He was not in the humour to seek anything; he\r\ncould only await the first sign of his altering lot.\r\n\r\nThe piazza with its sights of beauty was lit up by that warm morning\r\nsunlight under which the autumn dew still lingers, and which invites to\r\nan idleness undulled by fatigue. It was a festival morning, too, when\r\nthe soft warmth seems to steal over one with a special invitation to\r\nlounge and gaze. Here, too, the signs of the fair were present; in the\r\nspaces round the octagonal baptistery, stalls were being spread with\r\nfruit and flowers, and here and there laden mules were standing quietly\r\nabsorbed in their nose-bags, while their drivers were perhaps gone\r\nthrough the hospitable sacred doors to kneel before the blessed Virgin\r\non this morning of her Nativity. On the broad marble steps of the Duomo\r\nthere were scattered groups of beggars and gossiping talkers: here an\r\nold crone with white hair and hard sunburnt face encouraging a\r\nround-capped baby to try its tiny bare feet on the warmed marble, while\r\na dog sitting near snuffed at the performance suspiciously; there a\r\ncouple of shaggy-headed boys leaning to watch a small pale cripple who\r\nwas cutting a face on a cherry-stone; and above them on the wide\r\nplatform men were making changing knots in laughing desultory chat, or\r\nelse were standing in close couples gesticulating eagerly.\r\n\r\nBut the largest and most important company of loungers was that towards\r\nwhich Tito had to direct his steps. It was the busiest time of the day\r\nwith Nello, and in this warm season and at an hour when clients were\r\nnumerous, most men preferred being shaved under the pretty red and\r\nwhite awning in front of the shop rather than within narrow walls. It\r\nis not a sublime attitude for a man, to sit with lathered chin thrown\r\nbackward, and have his nose made a handle of; but to be shaved was a\r\nfashion of Florentine respectability, and it is astonishing how gravely\r\nmen look at each other when they are all in the fashion. It was the\r\nhour of the day, too, when yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s crop of gossip was freshest, and\r\nthe barber\xe2\x80\x99s tongue was always in its glory when his razor was busy;\r\nthe deft activity of those two instruments seemed to be set going by a\r\ncommon spring. Tito foresaw that it would be impossible for him to\r\nescape being drawn into the circle; he must smile and retort, and look\r\nperfectly at his ease. Well! it was but the ordeal of swallowing bread\r\nand cheese pills after all. The man who let the mere anticipation of\r\ndiscovery choke him was simply a man of weak nerves.\r\n\r\nBut just at that time Tito felt a hand laid on his shoulder, and no\r\namount of previous resolution could prevent the very unpleasant\r\nsensation with which that sudden touch jarred him. His face, as he\r\nturned it round, betrayed the inward shock; but the owner of the hand\r\nthat seemed to have such evil magic in it broke into a light laugh. He\r\nwas a young man about Tito\xe2\x80\x99s own age, with keen features, small\r\nclose-clipped head, and close-shaven lip and chin, giving the idea of a\r\nmind as little encumbered as possible with material that was not\r\nnervous. The keen eyes were bright with hope and friendliness, as so\r\nmany other young eyes have been that have afterwards closed on the\r\nworld in bitterness and disappointment; for at that time there were\r\nnone but pleasant predictions about Niccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli, as a young\r\nman of promise, who was expected to mend the broken fortunes of his\r\nancient family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Melema, what evil dream did you have last night, that you took my\r\nlight grasp for that of a _sbirro_ or something worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Messer Niccol\xc3\xb2!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, recovering himself immediately; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nmust have been an extra amount of dulness in my veins this morning that\r\nshuddered at the approach of your wit. But the fact is, I have had a\r\nbad night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is unlucky, because you will be expected to shine without any\r\nobstructing fog to-day in the Rucellai Gardens. I take it for granted\r\nyou are to be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMesser Bernardo did me the honour to invite me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nshall be engaged elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I remember, you are in love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, with a shrug,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9celse you would never have such inconvenient engagements. Why, we are\r\nto eat a peacock and ortolans under the loggia among Bernardo\r\nRucellai\xe2\x80\x99s rare trees; there are to be the choicest spirits in Florence\r\nand the choicest wines. Only, as Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici is to be there, the\r\nchoice spirits may happen to be swamped in the capping of impromptu\r\nverses. I hate that game; it is a device for the triumph of small wits,\r\nwho are always inspired the most by the smallest occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that you are saying about Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici and small wits,\r\nMesser Niccol\xc3\xb2?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, whose light figure was at that moment\r\npredominating over the Herculean frame of Niccol\xc3\xb2 Caparra.\r\n\r\nThat famous worker in iron, whom we saw last with bared muscular arms\r\nand leathern apron in the Mercato Vecchio, was this morning dressed in\r\nholiday suit, and as he sat submissively while Nello skipped round him,\r\nlathered him, seized him by the nose, and scraped him with magical\r\nquickness, he looked much as a lion might if it had donned linen and\r\ntunic and was preparing to go into society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA private secretary will never rise in the world if he couples great\r\nand small in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen great men are not\r\nallowed to marry their sons and daughters as they like, small men must\r\nnot expect to marry their words as they like. Have you heard the news\r\nDomenico Cennini, here, has been telling us?\xe2\x80\x94that Pagolantonio Soderini\r\nhas given Ser Piero da Bibbiena a box on the ear for setting on Piero\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Medici to interfere with the marriage between young Tommaso\r\nSoderini and Fiammetta Strozzi, and is to be sent ambassador to Venice\r\nas a punishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know which I envy him most,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, \xe2\x80\x9cthe offence\r\nor the punishment. The offence will make him the most popular man in\r\nall Florence, and the punishment will take him among the only people in\r\nItaly who have known how to manage their own affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if Soderini stays long enough at Venice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, \xe2\x80\x9che may\r\nchance to learn the Venetian fashion, and bring it home with him. The\r\nSoderini have been fast friends of the Medici, but what has happened is\r\nlikely to open Pagolantonio\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to the good of our old Florentine\r\ntrick of choosing a new harness when the old one galls us; if we have\r\nnot quite lost the trick in these last fifty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot we,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2 Caparra, who was rejoicing in the free use of\r\nhis lips again. \xe2\x80\x9cEat eggs in Lent and the snow will melt. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nsay to our people when they get noisy over their cups at San Gallo, and\r\ntalk of raising a _romor_ (insurrection): I say, never do you plan a\r\n_romor_; you may as well try to fill Arno with buckets. When there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwater enough Arno will be full, and that will not be till the torrent\r\nis ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaparra, that oracular speech of yours is due to my excellent\r\nshaving,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could never have made it with that dark rust\r\non your chin. Ecco, Messer Domenico, I am ready for you now. By the\r\nway, my bel erudito,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nello, as he saw Tito moving towards\r\nthe door, \xe2\x80\x9chere has been old Maso seeking for you, but your nest was\r\nempty. He will come again presently. The old man looked mournful, and\r\nseemed in haste. I hope there is nothing wrong in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless Messer Tito knows that Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s son is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronaca,\r\nwho had just come up.\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s heart gave a leap\xe2\x80\x94had the death happened before Romola saw him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I had not heard it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with no more discomposure than the\r\noccasion seemed to warrant, turning and leaning against the doorpost,\r\nas if he had given up his intention of going away. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that his\r\nsister had gone to see him. Did he die before she arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronaca; \xe2\x80\x9cI was in San Marco at the time, and saw her come\r\nout from the chapter-house with Fra Girolamo, who told us that the\r\ndying man\xe2\x80\x99s breath had been preserved as by a miracle, that he might\r\nmake a disclosure to his sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito felt that his fate was decided. Again his mind rushed over all the\r\ncircumstances of his departure from Florence, and he conceived a plan\r\nof getting back his money from Cennini before the disclosure had become\r\npublic. If he once had his money he need not stay long in endurance of\r\nscorching looks and biting words. He would wait now, and go away with\r\nCennini and get the money from him at once. With that project in his\r\nmind he stood motionless\xe2\x80\x94his hands in his belt, his eyes fixed absently\r\non the ground. Nello, glancing at him, felt sure that he was absorbed\r\nin anxiety about Romola, and thought him such a pretty image of\r\nself-forgetful sadness, that he just perceptibly pointed his razor at\r\nhim, and gave a challenging look at Piero di Cosimo, whom he had never\r\nforgiven for his refusal to see any prognostics of character in his\r\nfavourite\xe2\x80\x99s handsome face. Piero, who was leaning against the other\r\ndoorpost, close to Tito, shrugged his shoulders: the frequent\r\nrecurrence of such challenges from Nello had changed the painter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst declaration of neutrality into a positive inclination to believe\r\nill of the much-praised Greek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have got your Fra Girolamo back again, Cronaca? I suppose we\r\nshall have him preaching again this next Advent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not before there is need,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronaca, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have had the\r\nbest testimony to his words since the last Quaresima; for even to the\r\nwicked wickedness has become a plague; and the ripeness of vice is\r\nturning to rottenness in the nostrils even of the vicious. There has\r\nnot been a change since the Quaresima, either in Rome or at Florence,\r\nbut has put a new seal on the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s words\xe2\x80\x94that the harvest of sin is\r\nripe, and that God will reap it with a sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he has had a new vision, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesco Cei,\r\nsneeringly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old ones are somewhat stale. Can\xe2\x80\x99t your Frate get a\r\npoet to help out his imagination for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has no lack of poets about him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronaca, with quiet contempt,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut they are great poets and not little ones; so they are contented to\r\nbe taught by him, and no more think the truth stale which God has given\r\nhim to utter, than they think the light of the moon is stale. But\r\nperhaps certain high prelates and princes who dislike the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndenunciations might be pleased to hear that, though Giovanni Pico, and\r\nPoliziano, and Marsilio Ficino, and most other men of mark in Florence,\r\nreverence Fra Girolamo, Messer Francesco Cei despises him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoliziano?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cei, with a scornful laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, doubtless he\r\nbelieves in your new Jonah; witness the fine orations he wrote for the\r\nenvoys of Sienna, to tell Alexander the Sixth that the world and the\r\nChurch were never so well off as since he became Pope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Francesco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9ca various scholar must\r\nhave various opinions. And as for the Frate, whatever we may think of\r\nhis saintliness, you judge his preaching too narrowly. The secret of\r\noratory lies, not in saying new things, but in saying things with a\r\ncertain power that moves the hearers\xe2\x80\x94without which, as old Filelfo has\r\nsaid, your speaker deserves to be called, \xe2\x80\x98non oratorem, sed aratorem.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd, according to that test, Fra Girolamo is a great orator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, Niccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, speaking from the shaving-chair,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut part of the secret lies in the prophetic visions. Our people\xe2\x80\x94no\r\noffence to you, Cronaca\xe2\x80\x94will run after anything in the shape of a\r\nprophet, especially if he prophesies terrors and tribulations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather say, Cennini,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cronaca, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the chief secret lies in\r\nthe Frate\xe2\x80\x99s pure life and strong faith, which stamp him as a messenger\r\nof God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit it\xe2\x80\x94I admit it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, opening his palms, as he rose\r\nfrom the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cHis life is spotless: no man has impeached it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is satisfied with the pleasant lust of arrogance,\xe2\x80\x9d Cei burst out,\r\nbitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see it in that proud lip and satisfied eye of his. He\r\nhears the air filled with his own name\xe2\x80\x94Fra Girolamo Savonarola, of\r\nFerrara; the prophet, the saint, the mighty preacher, who frightens the\r\nvery babies of Florence into laying down their wicked baubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Francesco, you are out of humour with waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nconciliatory Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me stop your mouth with a little lather. I\r\nmust not have my friend Cronaca made angry: I have a regard for his\r\nchin; and his chin is in no respect altered since he became a Piagnone.\r\nAnd for my own part, I confess, when the Frate was preaching in the\r\nDuomo last Advent, I got into such a trick of slipping in to listen to\r\nhim that I might have turned Piagnone too, if I had not been hindered\r\nby the liberal nature of my art; and also by the length of the sermons,\r\nwhich are sometimes a good while before they get to the moving point.\r\nBut, as Messer Niccol\xc3\xb2 here says, the Frate lays hold of the people by\r\nsome power over and above his prophetic visions. Monks and nuns who\r\nprophesy are not of that rareness. For what says Luigi Pulci?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dombruno\xe2\x80\x99s sharp-cutting scimitar had the fame of being enchanted;\r\nbut,\xe2\x80\x99 says Luigi, \xe2\x80\x98I am rather of opinion that it cut sharp because it\r\nwas of strongly-tempered steel.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, yes; Paternosters may shave\r\nclean, but they must be said over a good razor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, Nello!\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat doctor is this advancing on his\r\nBucephalus? I thought your piazza was free from those furred and\r\nscarlet-robed lackeys of death. This man looks as if he had had some\r\nsuch night adventure as Boccaccio\xe2\x80\x99s Maestro Simone, and had his bonnet\r\nand mantle pickled a little in the gutter; though he himself is as\r\nsleek as a miller\xe2\x80\x99s rat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x93ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, with a low long-drawn intonation, as he looked up\r\ntowards the advancing figure\xe2\x80\x94a round-headed, round-bodied personage,\r\nseated on a raw young horse, which held its nose out with an air of\r\nthreatening obstinacy, and by a constant effort to back and go off in\r\nan oblique line showed free views about authority very much in advance\r\nof the age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have a few more adventures in pickle for him,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nello,\r\nin an undertone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I hope will drive his inquiring nostrils to\r\nanother quarter of the city. He\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor from Padua; they say he has\r\nbeen at Prato for three months, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s come to Florence to see\r\nwhat he can net. But his great trick is making rounds among the\r\ncontadini. And do you note those great saddle-bags he carries? They are\r\nto hold the fat capons and eggs and meal he levies on silly clowns with\r\nwhom coin is scarce. He vends his own secret medicines, so he keeps\r\naway from the doors of the druggists; and for this last week he has\r\ntaken to sitting in my piazza for two or three hours every day, and\r\nmaking it a resort for asthmas and squalling bambini. It stirs my gall\r\nto see the toad-faced quack fingering the greasy quattrini, or bagging\r\na pigeon in exchange for his pills and powders. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a few\r\nthorns in his saddle, else I\xe2\x80\x99m no Florentine. Laudamus! he is coming to\r\nbe shaved; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited for. Messer Domenico, go not away:\r\nwait; you shall see a rare bit of fooling, which I devised two days\r\nago. Here, Sandro!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNello whispered in the ear of Sandro, who rolled his solemn eyes,\r\nnodded, and, following up these signs of understanding with a slow\r\nsmile, took to his heels with surprising rapidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it with you, Maestro Tacco?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, as the doctor, with\r\ndifficulty, brought his horse\xe2\x80\x99s head round towards the barber\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a fine young horse of yours, but something raw in the mouth,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an accursed beast, the _vermocane_ seize him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maestro\r\nTacco, with a burst of irritation, descending from his saddle and\r\nfastening the old bridle, mended with string, to an iron staple in the\r\nwall. \xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, recollecting himself, \xe2\x80\x9ca sound beast\r\nand a valuable, for one who wanted to purchase, and get a profit by\r\ntraining him. I had him cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather too hard riding for a man who carries your weight of learning:\r\neh, Maestro?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly, I am likely to be hot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, taking off his bonnet,\r\nand giving to full view a bald low head and flat broad face, with high\r\nears, wide lipless mouth, round eyes, and deep arched lines above the\r\nprojecting eyebrows, which altogether made Nello\xe2\x80\x99s epithet \xe2\x80\x9ctoad-faced\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndubiously complimentary to the blameless batrachian. \xe2\x80\x9cRiding from\r\nPeretola, when the sun is high, is not the same thing as kicking your\r\nheels on a bench in the shade, like your Florence doctors. Moreover, I\r\nhave had not a little pulling to get through the carts and mules into\r\nthe Mercato, to find out the husband of a certain Monna Ghita, who had\r\nhad a fatal seizure before I was called in; and if it had not been that\r\nI had to demand my fees\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonna Ghita!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, as the perspiring doctor interrupted himself\r\nto rub his head and face. \xe2\x80\x9cPeace be with her angry soul! The Mercato\r\nwill want a whip the more if her tongue is laid to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, who had roused himself from his abstraction, and was listening to\r\nthe dialogue, felt a new rush of the vague half-formed ideas about\r\nTessa, which had passed through his mind the evening before: if Monna\r\nGhita were really taken out of the way, it would be easier for him to\r\nsee Tessa again\xe2\x80\x94whenever he wanted to see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Gnaff\xc3\xa8_, Maestro,\xe2\x80\x9d Nello went on, in a sympathising tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nthe slave of rude mortals, who, but for you, would die like brutes,\r\nwithout help of pill or powder. It is pitiful to see your learned lymph\r\noozing from your pores as if it were mere vulgar moisture. You think my\r\nshaving will cool and disencumber you? One moment and I have done with\r\nMesser Francesco here. It seems to me a thousand years till I wait upon\r\na man who carries all the science of Arabia in his head and\r\nsaddle-bags. Ecco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNello held up the shaving-cloth with an air of invitation, and Maestro\r\nTacco advanced and seated himself under a preoccupation with his heat\r\nand his self-importance, which made him quite deaf to the irony\r\nconveyed in Nello\xe2\x80\x99s officiously polite speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is but fitting that a great medicus like you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello,\r\nadjusting the cloth, \xe2\x80\x9cshould be shaved by the same razor that has\r\nshaved the illustrious Antonio Benevieni, the greatest master of the\r\nchirurgic art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chirurgic art!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the doctor, with an air of\r\ncontemptuous disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it your Florentine fashion to put the masters\r\nof the science of medicine on a level with men who do carpentry on\r\nbroken limbs, and sew up wounds like tailors, and carve away\r\nexcrescences as a butcher trims meat? _Via_! A manual art, such as any\r\nartificer might learn, and which has been practised by simple barbers\r\nlike yourself\xe2\x80\x94on a level with the noble science of Hippocrates, Galen,\r\nand Avicenna, which penetrates into the occult influences of the stars\r\nand plants and gems!\xe2\x80\x94a science locked up from the vulgar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, in truth, Maestro,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, using his lather very\r\ndeliberately, as if he wanted to prolong the operation to the utmost,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of placing them on a level: I know your science comes\r\nnext to the miracles of Holy Church for mystery. But there, you see, is\r\nthe pity of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Nello fell into a tone of regretful\r\nsympathy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyour high science is sealed from the profane and the vulgar,\r\nand so you become an object of envy and slander. I grieve to say it,\r\nbut there are low fellows in this city\xe2\x80\x94mere _sgherri_, who go about in\r\nnightcaps and long beards, and make it their business to sprinkle gall\r\nin every man\xe2\x80\x99s broth who is prospering. Let me tell you\xe2\x80\x94for you are a\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x94this is a city where every man had need carry a large nail\r\nready to fasten on the wheel of Fortune when his side happens to be\r\nuppermost. Already there are stories\xe2\x80\x94mere fables doubtless\xe2\x80\x94beginning to\r\nbe buzzed about concerning you, that make me wish I could hear of your\r\nbeing well on your way to Arezzo. I would not have a man of your metal\r\nstoned, for though San Stefano was stoned, he was not great in medicine\r\nlike San Cosmo and San Damiano...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat stories? what fables?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Maestro Tacco. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Lasso_! I fear me you are come into the trap for your cheese,\r\nMaestro. The fact is, there is a company of evil youths who go prowling\r\nabout the houses of our citizens carrying sharp tools in their\r\npockets;\xe2\x80\x94no sort of door, or window, or shutter, but they will pierce\r\nit. They are possessed with a diabolical patience to watch the doings\r\nof people who fancy themselves private. It must be they who have done\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94it must be they who have spread the stories about you and your\r\nmedicines. Have you by chance detected any small aperture in your door,\r\nor window-shutter? No? Well, I advise you to look; for it is now\r\ncommonly talked of that you have been seen in your dwelling at the\r\nCanto di Paglia, making your secret specifics by night: pounding dried\r\ntoads in a mortar, compounding a salve out of mashed worms, and making\r\nyour pills from the dried livers of rats which you mix with saliva\r\nemitted during the utterance of a blasphemous incantation\xe2\x80\x94which indeed\r\nthese witnesses profess to repeat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pack of lies!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the doctor, struggling to get\r\nutterance, and then desisting in alarm at the approaching razor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not to me, or any of this respectable company, that you need to\r\nsay that, doctor. _We_ are not the heads to plant such carrots as those\r\nin. But what of that? What are a handful of reasonable men against a\r\ncrowd with stones in their hands? There are those among us who think\r\nCecco d\xe2\x80\x99Ascoli was an innocent sage\xe2\x80\x94and we all know how he was burnt\r\nalive for being wiser than his fellows. Ah, doctor, it is not by living\r\nat Padua that you can learn to know Florentines. My belief is, they\r\nwould stone the Holy Father himself, if they could find a good excuse\r\nfor it; and they are persuaded that you are a necromancer, who is\r\ntrying to raise the pestilence by selling secret medicines\xe2\x80\x94and I am\r\ntold your specifics have in truth an evil smell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is false!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out the doctor, as Nello moved away his razor; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis false! I will show the pills and the powders to these honourable\r\nsignori\xe2\x80\x94and the salve\xe2\x80\x94it has an excellent odour\xe2\x80\x94an odour of\xe2\x80\x94of salve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe started up with the lather on his chin, and the cloth round his\r\nneck, to search in his saddle-bag for the belied medicines, and Nello\r\nin an instant adroitly shifted the shaving-chair till it was in the\r\nclose vicinity of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, while Sandro, who had now returned,\r\nat a sign from his master placed himself near the bridle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold, Messeri!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, bringing a small box of medicines\r\nand opening it before them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet any signor apply this box to his nostrils and he will find an\r\nhonest odour of medicaments\xe2\x80\x94not indeed of pounded gems, or rare\r\nvegetables from the East, or stones found in the bodies of birds; for I\r\npractise on the diseases of the vulgar, for whom heaven has provided\r\ncheaper and less powerful remedies according to their degree: and there\r\nare even remedies known to our science which are entirely free of\r\ncost\xe2\x80\x94as the new _tussis_ may be counteracted in the poor, who can pay\r\nfor no specifics, by a resolute holding of the breath. And here is a\r\npaste which is even of savoury odour, and is infallible against\r\nmelancholia, being concocted under the conjunction of Jupiter and\r\nVenus; and I have seen it allay spasms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, Maestro,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, while the doctor had his lathered face\r\nturned towards the group near the door, eagerly holding out his box,\r\nand lifting out one specific after another; \xe2\x80\x9chere comes a crying\r\ncontadina with her baby. Doubtless she is in search of you; it is\r\nperhaps an opportunity for you to show this honourable company a proof\r\nof your skill. Here, buona donna! here is the famous doctor. Why, what\r\nis the matter with the sweet _bimbo_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question was addressed to a sturdy-looking, broad-shouldered\r\ncontadina, with her head-drapery folded about her face so that little\r\nwas to be seen but a bronzed nose and a pair of dark eyes and eyebrows.\r\nShe carried her child packed up in the stiff mummy-shaped case in which\r\nItalian babies have been from time immemorial introduced into society,\r\nturning its face a little towards her bosom, and making those sorrowful\r\ngrimaces which women are in the habit of using as a sort of pulleys to\r\ndraw down reluctant tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for the love of the Holy Madonna!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, in a wailing\r\nvoice; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you look at my poor bimbo? I know I can\xe2\x80\x99t pay you for it,\r\nbut I took it into the Nunziata last night, and it\xe2\x80\x99s turned a worse\r\ncolour than before; it\xe2\x80\x99s the convulsions. But when I was holding it\r\nbefore the Santissima Nunziata, I remembered they said there was a new\r\ndoctor come who cured everything; and so I thought it might be the will\r\nof the Holy Madonna that I should bring it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Maestro, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is an opportunity for\r\nyou; here are honourable witnesses who will declare before the\r\nMagnificent Eight that they have seen you practising honestly and\r\nrelieving a poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s child. And then if your life is in danger, the\r\nMagnificent Eight will put you in prison a little while just to insure\r\nyour safety, and after that, their sbirri will conduct you out of\r\nFlorence by night, as they did the zealous Frate Minore who preached\r\nagainst the Jews. What! our people are given to stone-throwing; but we\r\nhave magistrates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, unable to refuse, seated himself in the shaving-chair,\r\ntrembling, half with fear and half with rage, and by this time quite\r\nunconscious of the lather which Nello had laid on with such\r\nprofuseness. He deposited his medicine-case on his knees, took out his\r\nprecious spectacles (wondrous Florentine device!) from his wallet,\r\nlodged them carefully above his flat nose and high ears, and lifting up\r\nhis brows, turned towards the applicant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Santiddio! look at him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, with a more piteous wail\r\nthan ever, as she held out the small mummy, which had its head\r\ncompletely concealed by dingy drapery wound round the head of the\r\nportable cradle, but seemed to be struggling and crying in a demoniacal\r\nfashion under this imprisonment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fit is on him! _Ohim\xc3\xa8_! I know\r\nwhat colour he is; it\xe2\x80\x99s the evil eye\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, anxiously holding his knees together to support his box,\r\nbent his spectacles towards the baby, and said cautiously, \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a\r\nnew disease; unwind these rags, Monna!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contadina, with sudden energy, snatched off the encircling linen,\r\nwhen out struggled\xe2\x80\x94scratching, grinning, and screaming\xe2\x80\x94what the doctor\r\nin his fright fully believed to be a demon, but what Tito recognised as\r\nVaiano\xe2\x80\x99s monkey, made more formidable by an artificial blackness, such\r\nas might have come from a hasty rubbing up the chimney.\r\n\r\nUp started the unfortunate doctor, letting his medicine-box fall, and\r\naway jumped the no less terrified and indignant monkey, finding the\r\nfirst resting-place for his claws on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane, which he used as\r\na sort of rope-ladder till he had fairly found his equilibrium, when he\r\ncontinued to clutch it as a bridle. The horse wanted no spur under such\r\na rider, and, the already loosened bridle offering no resistance,\r\ndarted off across the piazza, with the monkey, clutching, grinning, and\r\nblinking, on his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Il cavallo! Il Diavolo_!\xe2\x80\x9d was now shouted on all sides by the idle\r\nrascals who gathered from all quarters of the piazza, and was echoed in\r\ntones of alarm by the stall-keepers, whose vested interests seemed in\r\nsome danger; while the doctor, out of his wits with confused terror at\r\nthe Devil, the possible stoning, and the escape of his horse, took to\r\nhis heels with spectacles on nose, lathered face, and the shaving-cloth\r\nabout his neck, crying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cStop him! stop him! for a powder\xe2\x80\x94a florin\xe2\x80\x94stop\r\nhim for a florin!\xe2\x80\x9d while the lads, outstripping him, clapped their\r\nhands and shouted encouragement to the runaway.\r\n\r\nThe _cerretano_, who had not bargained for the flight of his monkey\r\nalong with the horse, had caught up his petticoats with much celerity,\r\nand showed a pair of parti-coloured hose above his contadina\xe2\x80\x99s shoes,\r\nfar in advance of the doctor. And away went the grotesque race up the\r\nCorso degli Adimari\xe2\x80\x94the horse with the singular jockey, the contadina\r\nwith the remarkable hose, and the doctor in lather and spectacles, with\r\nfurred mantle outflying.\r\n\r\nIt was a scene such as Florentines loved, from the potent and reverend\r\nsignor going to council in his lucco, down to the grinning youngster,\r\nwho felt himself master of all situations when his bag was filled with\r\nsmooth stones from the convenient dry bed of the torrent. The\r\ngrey-headed Domenico Cennini laughed no less heartily than the younger\r\nmen, and Nello was triumphantly secure of the general admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, snapping his fingers when the first burst of\r\nlaughter was subsiding. \xe2\x80\x9cI have cleared my piazza of that unsavoury\r\nfly-trap, _mi pare_. Maestro Tacco will no more come here again to sit\r\nfor patients than he will take to licking marble for his dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going towards the Piazza della Signoria, Messer Domenico,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Macchiavelli. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go with you, and we shall perhaps see who\r\nhas deserved the _palio_ among these racers. Come, Melema, will you go\r\ntoo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been precisely Tito\xe2\x80\x99s intention to accompany Cennini, but before\r\nhe had gone many steps, he was called back by Nello, who saw Maso\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nMaso\xe2\x80\x99s message was from Romola. She wished Tito to go to the Via de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBardi as soon as possible. She would see him under the loggia, at the\r\ntop of the house, as she wished to speak to him alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nUnder the Loggia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loggia at the top of Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s house rose above the buildings on each\r\nside of it, and formed a gallery round quadrangular walls. On the side\r\ntowards the street the roof was supported by columns; but on the\r\nremaining sides, by a wall pierced with arched openings, so that at the\r\nback, looking over a crowd of irregular, poorly-built dwellings towards\r\nthe hill of Bogoli, Romola could at all times have a walk sheltered\r\nfrom observation. Near one of those arched openings, close to the door\r\nby which he had entered the loggia, Tito awaited her, with a sickening\r\nsense of the sunlight that slanted before him and mingled itself with\r\nthe ruin of his hopes. He had never for a moment relied on Romola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassion for him as likely to be too strong for the repulsion created by\r\nthe discovery of his secret; he had not the presumptuous vanity which\r\nmight have hindered him from feeling that her love had the same root\r\nwith her belief in him. But as he imagined her coming towards him in\r\nher radiant beauty, made so loveably mortal by her soft hazel eyes, he\r\nfell into wishing that she had been something lower, if it were only\r\nthat she might let him clasp her and kiss her before they parted. He\r\nhad had no real caress from her\xe2\x80\x94nothing but now and then a long glance,\r\na kiss, a pressure of the hand; and he had so often longed that they\r\nshould be alone together. They were going to be alone now; but he saw\r\nher standing inexorably aloof from him. His heart gave a great throb as\r\nhe saw the door move: Romola was there. It was all like a flash of\r\nlightning: he felt, rather than saw, the glory about her head, the\r\ntearful appealing eyes; he felt, rather than heard, the cry of love\r\nwith which she said, \xe2\x80\x9cTito!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in the same moment she was in his arms, and sobbing with her face\r\nagainst his.\r\n\r\nHow poor Romola had yearned through the watches of the night to see\r\nthat bright face! The new image of death; the strange bewildering doubt\r\ninfused into her by the story of a life removed from her understanding\r\nand sympathy; the haunting vision, which she seemed not only to hear\r\nuttered by the low gasping voice, but to live through, as if it had\r\nbeen her own dream, had made her more conscious than ever that it was\r\nTito who had first brought the warm stream of hope and gladness into\r\nher life, and who had first turned away the keen edge of pain in the\r\nremembrance of her brother. She would tell Tito everything; there was\r\nno one else to whom she could tell it. She had been restraining herself\r\nin the presence of her father all the morning; but now, that\r\nlong-pent-up sob might come forth. Proud and self-controlled to all the\r\nworld beside, Romola was as simple and unreserved as a child in her\r\nlove for Tito. She had been quite contented with the days when they had\r\nonly looked at each other; but now, when she felt the need of clinging\r\nto him, there was no thought that hindered her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Romola! my goddess!\xe2\x80\x9d Tito murmured with passionate fondness, as he\r\nclasped her gently, and kissed the thick golden ripples on her neck. He\r\nwas in paradise: disgrace, shame, parting\xe2\x80\x94there was no fear of them any\r\nlonger. This happiness was too strong to be marred by the sense that\r\nRomola was deceived in him; nay, he could only rejoice in her delusion;\r\nfor, after all, concealment had been wisdom. The only thing he could\r\nregret was his needless dread; if, indeed, the dread had not been worth\r\nsuffering for the sake of this sudden rapture.\r\n\r\nThe sob had satisfied itself, and Romola raised her head. Neither of\r\nthem spoke; they stood looking at each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces with that sweet\r\nwonder which belongs to young love\xe2\x80\x94she with her long white hands on the\r\ndark-brown curls, and he with his dark fingers bathed in the streaming\r\ngold. Each was so beautiful to the other; each was experiencing that\r\nundisturbed mutual consciousness for the first time. The cold pressure\r\nof a new sadness on Romola\xe2\x80\x99s heart made her linger the more in that\r\nsilent soothing sense of nearness and love; and Tito could not even\r\nseek to press his lips to hers, because that would be change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cit has been altogether painful, but I must\r\ntell you everything. Your strength will help me to resist the\r\nimpressions that will not be shaken off by reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Romola\xe2\x80\x94I know he is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; and the long lustrous\r\neyes told nothing of the many wishes that would have brought about that\r\ndeath long ago if there had been such potency in mere wishes. Romola\r\nonly read her own pure thoughts in their dark depths, as we read\r\nletters in happy dreams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo changed, Tito! It pierced me to think that it was Dino. And so\r\nstrangely hard: not a word to my father; nothing but a vision that he\r\nwanted to tell me. And yet it was so piteous\xe2\x80\x94the struggling breath, and\r\nthe eyes that seemed to look towards the crucifix, and yet not to see\r\nit. I shall never forget it; it seems as if it would come between me\r\nand everything I shall look at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s heart swelled again, so that she was forced to break off. But\r\nthe need she felt to disburden her mind to Tito urged her to repress\r\nthe rising anguish. When she began to speak again, her thoughts had\r\ntravelled a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was strange, Tito. The vision was about our marriage, and yet he\r\nknew nothing of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it, my Romola? Sit down and tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, leading her\r\nto the bench that stood near. A fear had come across him lest the\r\nvision should somehow or other relate to Baldassarre; and this sudden\r\nchange of feeling prompted him to seek a change of position.\r\n\r\nRomola told him all that had passed, from her entrance into San Marco,\r\nhardly leaving out one of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s words, which had burnt\r\nthemselves into her memory as they were spoken. But when she was at the\r\nend of the vision, she paused; the rest came too vividly before her to\r\nbe uttered, and she sat looking at the distance, almost unconscious for\r\nthe moment that Tito was near her. _His_ mind was at ease now; that\r\nvague vision had passed over him like white mist, and left no mark. But\r\nhe was silent, expecting her to speak again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took it,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, as if Tito had been reading her thoughts; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntook the crucifix; it is down below in my bedroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, entreatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will banish these\r\nghastly thoughts. The vision was an ordinary monkish vision, bred of\r\nfasting and fanatical ideas. It surely has no weight with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tito; no. But poor Dino, _he_ believed it was a divine message. It\r\nis strange,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on meditatively, \xe2\x80\x9cthis life of men possessed with\r\nfervid beliefs that seem like madness to their fellow-beings. Dino was\r\nnot a vulgar fanatic; and that Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x94his very voice seems to\r\nhave penetrated me with a sense that there is some truth in what moves\r\nthem: some truth of which I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only because your feelings were highly wrought, my Romola. Your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind was no more than a form of that theosophy which\r\nhas been the common disease of excitable dreamy minds in all ages; the\r\nsame ideas that your father\xe2\x80\x99s old antagonist, Marsilio Ficino, pores\r\nover in the New Platonists; only your brother\xe2\x80\x99s passionate nature drove\r\nhim to act out what other men write and talk about. And for Fra\r\nGirolamo, he is simply a narrow-minded monk, with a gift of preaching\r\nand infusing terror into the multitude. Any words or any voice would\r\nhave shaken you at that moment. When your mind has had a little repose,\r\nyou will judge of such things as you have always done before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot about poor Dino,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cI was angry with him; my heart\r\nseemed to close against him while he was speaking; but since then I\r\nhave thought less of what was in my own mind and more of what was in\r\nhis. Oh, Tito! it was very piteous to see his young life coming to an\r\nend in that way. That yearning look at the crucifix when he was gasping\r\nfor breath\xe2\x80\x94I can never forget it. Last night I looked at the crucifix a\r\nlong while, and tried to see that it would help him, until at last it\r\nseemed to me by the lamplight as if the suffering face shed pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Romola, promise me to resist such thoughts; they are fit for sickly\r\nnuns, not for my golden-tressed Aurora, who looks made to scatter all\r\nsuch twilight fantasies. Try not to think of them now; we shall not\r\nlong be alone together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last words were uttered in a tone of tender beseeching, and he\r\nturned her face towards him with a gentle touch of his right-hand.\r\n\r\nRomola had had her eyes fixed absently on the arched opening, but she\r\nhad not seen the distant hill; she had all the while been in the\r\nchapter house, looking at the pale images of sorrow and death.\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s touch and beseeching voice recalled her; and now in the warm\r\nsunlight she saw that rich dark beauty which seemed to gather round it\r\nall images of joy\xe2\x80\x94purple vines festooned between the elms, the strong\r\ncorn perfecting itself under the vibrating heat, bright winged\r\ncreatures hurrying and resting among the flowers, round limbs beating\r\nthe earth in gladness with cymbals held aloft, light melodies chanted\r\nto the thrilling rhythm of strings\xe2\x80\x94all objects and all sounds that tell\r\nof Nature revelling in her force. Strange, bewildering transition from\r\nthose pale images of sorrow and death to this bright youthfulness, as\r\nof a sun-god who knew nothing of night! What thought could reconcile\r\nthat worn anguish in her brother\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94that straining after something\r\ninvisible\xe2\x80\x94with this satisfied strength and beauty, and make it\r\nintelligible that they belonged to the same world? Or was there never\r\nany reconciling of them, but only a blind worship of clashing deities,\r\nfirst in mad joy and then in wailing? Romola for the first time felt\r\nthis questioning need like a sudden uneasy dizziness and want of\r\nsomething to grasp; it was an experience hardly longer than a sigh, for\r\nthe eager theorising of ages is compressed, as in a seed, in the\r\nmomentary want of a single mind. But there was no answer to meet the\r\nneed, and it vanished before the returning rush of young sympathy with\r\nthe glad loving beauty that beamed upon her in new radiance, like the\r\ndawn after we have looked away from it to the grey west.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mind lingers apart from our love, my Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d Tito said, with a\r\nsoft reproachful murmur. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a forgotten thing to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the beseeching eyes in silence, till the sadness all\r\nmelted out of her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy joy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her full clear voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really care for me enough, then, to banish those chill fancies,\r\nor shall you always be suspecting me as the Great Tempter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito,\r\nwith his bright smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I not care for you more than for everything else?\r\nEverything I had felt before in all my life\xe2\x80\x94about my father, and about\r\nmy loneliness\xe2\x80\x94was a preparation to love you. You would laugh at me,\r\nTito, if you knew what sort of man I used to think I should marry\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nscholar with deep lines in his face, like Alamanno Rinuccini, and with\r\nrather grey hair, who would agree with my father in taking the side of\r\nthe Aristotelians, and be willing to live with him. I used to think\r\nabout the love I read of in the poets, but I never dreamed that\r\nanything like that could happen to me here in Florence in our old\r\nlibrary. And then _you_ came, Tito, and were so much to my father, and\r\nI began to believe that life could be happy for me too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goddess! is there any woman like you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with a mixture of\r\nfondness and wondering admiration at the blended majesty and simplicity\r\nin her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, rather timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you minded more about\r\nour marriage, you would persuade your father and Messer Bernardo not to\r\nthink of any more delays. But you seem not to mind about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Tito, I will, I do mind. But I am sure my godfather will urge\r\nmore delay now, because of Dino\xe2\x80\x99s death. He has never agreed with my\r\nfather about disowning Dino, and you know he has always said that we\r\nought to wait until you have been at least a year in Florence. Do not\r\nthink hardly of my godfather. I know he is prejudiced and narrow, but\r\nyet he is very noble. He has often said that it is folly in my father\r\nto want to keep his library apart, that it may bear his name; yet he\r\nwould try to get my father\xe2\x80\x99s wish carried out. That seems to me very\r\ngreat and noble\xe2\x80\x94that power of respecting a feeling which he does not\r\nshare or understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no rancour against Messer Bernardo for thinking you too\r\nprecious for me, my Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito: and that was true. \xe2\x80\x9cBut your\r\nfather, then, knows of his son\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I told him\xe2\x80\x94I could not help it. I told him where I had been, and\r\nthat I had seen Dino die; but nothing else; and he has commanded me not\r\nto speak of it again. But he has been very silent this morning, and has\r\nhad those restless movements which always go to my heart; they look as\r\nif he were trying to get outside the prison of his blindness. Let us go\r\nto him now. I had persuaded him to try to sleep, because he slept\r\nlittle in the night. Your voice will soothe him, Tito: it always does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not one kiss? I have not had one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, in his gentle\r\nreproachful tone, which gave him an air of dependence very charming in\r\na creature with those rare gifts that seem to excuse presumption.\r\n\r\nThe sweet pink blush spread itself with the quickness of light over\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s face and neck as she bent towards him. It seemed impossible\r\nthat their kisses could ever become common things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us walk once round the loggia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore we go down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something grim and grave to me always about Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, as they paused in the front of the house, where they could see\r\nover the opposite roofs to the other side of the river, \xe2\x80\x9cand even in\r\nits merriment there is something shrill and hard\xe2\x80\x94biting rather than\r\ngay. I wish we lived in Southern Italy, where thought is broken, not by\r\nweariness, but by delicious languors such as never seem to come over\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98ingenia acerrima Florentina.\xe2\x80\x99 I should like to see you under that\r\nsouthern sun, lying among the flowers, subdued into mere enjoyment,\r\nwhile I bent over you and touched the lute and sang to you some little\r\nunconscious strain that seemed all one with the light and the warmth.\r\nYou have never known that happiness of the nymphs, my Romola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I have dreamed of it often since you came. I am very thirsty\r\nfor a deep draught of joy\xe2\x80\x94for a life all bright like you. But we will\r\nnot think of it now, Tito; it seems to me as if there would always be\r\npale sad faces among the flowers, and eyes that look in vain. Let us\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nThe Portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Tito left the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi that day in exultant satisfaction at\r\nfinding himself thoroughly free from the threatened peril, his\r\nthoughts, no longer claimed by the immediate presence of Romola and her\r\nfather, recurred to those futile hours of dread in which he was\r\nconscious of having not only felt but acted as he would not have done\r\nif he had had a truer foresight. He would not have parted with his\r\nring; for Romola, and others to whom it was a familiar object, would be\r\na little struck with the apparent sordidness of parting with a gem he\r\nhad professedly cherished, unless he feigned as a reason the desire to\r\nmake some special gift with the purchase-money; and Tito had at that\r\nmoment a nauseating weariness of simulation. He was well out of the\r\npossible consequences that might have fallen on him from that initial\r\ndeception, and it was no longer a load on his mind; kind fortune had\r\nbrought him immunity, and he thought it was only fair that she should.\r\nWho was hurt by it? The results to Baldassarre were too problematical\r\nto be taken into account. But he wanted now to be free from any hidden\r\nshackles that would gall him, though ever so little, under his ties to\r\nRomola. He was not aware that that very delight in immunity which\r\nprompted resolutions not to entangle himself again, was deadening the\r\nsensibilities which alone could save him from entanglement.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the sale of the ring was a slight matter. Was it also a\r\nslight matter that little Tessa was under a delusion which would\r\ndoubtless fill her small head with expectations doomed to\r\ndisappointment? Should he try to see the little thing alone again and\r\nundeceive her at once, or should he leave the disclosure to time and\r\nchance? Happy dreams are pleasant, and they easily come to an end with\r\ndaylight and the stir of life. The sweet, pouting, innocent, round\r\nthing! It was impossible not to think of her. Tito thought he should\r\nlike some time to take her a present that would please her, and just\r\nlearn if her step-father treated her more cruelly now her mother was\r\ndead. Or, should he at once undeceive Tessa, and then tell Romola about\r\nher, so that they might find some happier lot for the poor thing? No:\r\nthat unfortunate little incident of the _cerretano_ and the marriage,\r\nand his allowing Tessa to part from him in delusion, must never be\r\nknown to Romola, and since no enlightenment could expel it from Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, there would always be a risk of betrayal; besides even little\r\nTessa might have some gall in her when she found herself disappointed\r\nin her love\xe2\x80\x94yes, she _must_ be a little in love with him, and that\r\nmight make it well that he should not see her again. Yet it was a\r\ntrifling adventure such as a country girl would perhaps ponder on till\r\nsome ruddy contadino made acceptable love to her, when she would break\r\nher resolution of secrecy and get at the truth that she was free.\r\n_Dunque_\xe2\x80\x94good-bye, Tessa! kindest wishes! Tito had made up his mind\r\nthat the silly little affair of the _cerretano_ should have no further\r\nconsequences for himself; and people are apt to think that resolutions\r\ntaken on their own behalf will be firm. As for the fifty-five florins,\r\nthe purchase-money of the ring, Tito had made up his mind what to do\r\nwith some of them; he would carry out a pretty ingenious thought which\r\nwould set him more at ease in accounting for the absence of his ring to\r\nRomola, and would also serve him as a means of guarding her mind from\r\nthe recurrence of those monkish fancies which were especially repugnant\r\nto him; and with this thought in his mind, he went to the Via Gualfonda\r\nto find Piero di Cosimo, the artist who at that time was pre-eminent in\r\nthe fantastic mythological design which Tito\xe2\x80\x99s purpose required.\r\n\r\nEntering the court on which Piero\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling opened, Tito found the\r\nheavy iron knocker on the door thickly bound round with wool and\r\ningeniously fastened with cords. Remembering the painter\xe2\x80\x99s practice of\r\nstuffing his ears against obtrusive noises, Tito was not much surprised\r\nat this mode of defence against visitors\xe2\x80\x99 thunder, and betook himself\r\nfirst to tapping modestly with his knuckles, and then to a more\r\nimportunate attempt to shake the door. In vain! Tito was moving away,\r\nblaming himself for wasting his time on this visit, instead of waiting\r\ntill he saw the painter again at Nello\xe2\x80\x99s, when a little girl entered\r\nthe court with a basket of eggs on her arm, went up to the door, and\r\nstanding on tiptoe, pushed up a small iron plate that ran in grooves,\r\nand putting her mouth to the aperture thus disclosed, called out in a\r\npiping voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMesser Piero!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Tito heard the sound of bolts, the door opened, and\r\nPiero presented himself in a red night-cap and a loose brown serge\r\ntunic, with sleeves rolled up to the shoulder. He darted a look of\r\nsurprise at Tito, but without further notice of him stretched out his\r\nhand to take the basket from the child, re-entered the house, and\r\npresently returning with the empty basket, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow much to pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo grossoni, Messer Piero; they are all ready boiled, my mother\r\nsays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiero took the coin out of the leathern scarsella at his belt, and the\r\nlittle maiden trotted away, not without a few upward glances of awed\r\nadmiration at the surprising young signor.\r\n\r\nPiero\xe2\x80\x99s glance was much less complimentary as he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want at my door, Messer Greco? I saw you this morning at\r\nNello\xe2\x80\x99s; if you had asked me then, I could have told you that I see no\r\nman in this house without knowing his business and agreeing with him\r\nbeforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, Messer Piero,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with his imperturbable good-humour;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI acted without sufficient reflection. I remembered nothing but your\r\nadmirable skill in inventing pretty caprices, when a sudden desire for\r\nsomething of that sort prompted me to come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe painter\xe2\x80\x99s manners were too notoriously odd to all the world for\r\nthis reception to be held a special affront; but even if Tito had\r\nsuspected any offensive intention, the impulse to resentment would have\r\nbeen less strong in him than the desire to conquer goodwill.\r\n\r\nPiero made a grimace which was habitual with him when he was spoken to\r\nwith flattering suavity. He grinned, stretched out the corners of his\r\nmouth, and pressed down his brows, so as to defy any divination of his\r\nfeelings under that kind of stroking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may that need be?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. In his\r\nheart he was tempted by the hinted opportunity of applying his\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a very delicate miniature device taken from certain fables of\r\nthe poets, which you will know how to combine for me. It must be\r\npainted on a wooden case\xe2\x80\x94I will show you the size\xe2\x80\x94in the form of a\r\ntriptych. The inside may be simple gilding: it is on the outside I want\r\nthe device. It is a favourite subject with you Florentines\xe2\x80\x94the triumph\r\nof Bacchus and Ariadne; but I want it treated in a new way. A story in\r\nOvid will give you the necessary hints. The young Bacchus must be\r\nseated in a ship, his head bound with clusters of grapes, and a spear\r\nentwined with vine-leaves in his hand: dark-berried ivy must wind about\r\nthe masts and sails, the oars must be thyrsi, and flowers must wreathe\r\nthemselves about the poop; leopards and tigers must be crouching before\r\nhim, and dolphins must be sporting round. But I want to have the\r\nfair-haired Ariadne with him, made immortal with her golden crown\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis not in Ovid\xe2\x80\x99s story, but no matter, you will conceive it all\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nabove there must be young Loves, such as you know how to paint,\r\nshooting with roses at the points of their arrows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more!\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero. \xe2\x80\x9cI have Ovid in the vulgar tongue. Find me\r\nthe passage. I love not to be choked with other men\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. You may\r\ncome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiero led the way through the first room, where a basket of eggs was\r\ndeposited on the open hearth, near a heap of broken egg-shells and a\r\nbank of ashes. In strange keeping with that sordid litter, there was a\r\nlow bedstead of carved ebony, covered carelessly with a piece of rich\r\noriental carpet, that looked as if it had served to cover the steps to\r\na Madonna\xe2\x80\x99s throne; and a carved _cassone_, or large chest, with\r\npainted devices on its sides and lid. There was hardly any other\r\nfurniture in the large room, except casts, wooden steps, easels and\r\nrough boxes, all festooned with cobwebs.\r\n\r\nThe next room was still larger, but it was also much more crowded.\r\nApparently Piero was keeping the Festa, for the double door underneath\r\nthe window which admitted the painter\xe2\x80\x99s light from above, was thrown\r\nopen, and showed a garden, or rather thicket, in which fig-trees and\r\nvines grew in tangled trailing wildness among nettles and hemlocks, and\r\na tall cypress lifted its dark head from a stifling mass of yellowish\r\nmulberry-leaves. It seemed as if that dank luxuriance had begun to\r\npenetrate even within the walls of the wide and lofty room; for in one\r\ncorner, amidst a confused heap of carved marble fragments and rusty\r\narmour, tufts of long grass and dark feathery fennel had made their\r\nway, and a large stone vase, tilted on one side, seemed to be pouring\r\nout the ivy that streamed around. All about the walls hung pen and\r\noil-sketches of fantastic sea-monsters; dances of satyrs and maenads;\r\nSaint Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s resurrection out of the devouring dragon; Madonnas\r\nwith the supernal light upon them; studies of plants and grotesque\r\nheads; and on irregular rough shelves a few books were scattered among\r\ngreat drooping bunches of corn, bullocks\xe2\x80\x99 horns, pieces of dried\r\nhoneycomb, stones with patches of rare-coloured lichen, skulls and\r\nbones, peacocks\xe2\x80\x99 feathers, and large birds\xe2\x80\x99 wings. Rising from amongst\r\nthe dirty litter of the floor were lay figures: one in the frock of a\r\nVallombrosan monk, strangely surmounted by a helmet with barred visor,\r\nanother smothered with brocade and skins hastily tossed over it.\r\nAmongst this heterogeneous still life, several speckled and white\r\npigeons were perched or strutting, too tame to fly at the entrance of\r\nmen; three corpulent toads were crawling in an intimate friendly way\r\nnear the door-stone; and a white rabbit, apparently the model for that\r\nwhich was frightening Cupid in the picture of Mars and Venus placed on\r\nthe central easel, was twitching its nose with much content on a box\r\nfull of bran.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Messer Greco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, making a sign to Tito that he\r\nmight sit down on a low stool near the door, and then standing over him\r\nwith folded arms, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be trying to see everything at once, like\r\nMesser Domeneddio, but let me know how large you would have this same\r\ntriptych.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito indicated the required dimensions, and Piero marked them on a\r\npiece of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now for the book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, reaching down a manuscript volume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing about the Ariadne there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, giving him the\r\npassage; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you will remember I want the crowned Ariadne by the side\r\nof the young Bacchus: she must have golden hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, abruptly, pursing up his lips again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you want\r\nthem to be likenesses, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking down into Tito\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nTito laughed and blushed. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are great at portraits, Messer\r\nPiero; but I could not ask Ariadne to sit for you, because the painting\r\nis a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is! I want her to sit to me. Giovanni Vespucci wants me to\r\npaint him a picture of Oedipus and Antigone at Colonos, as he has\r\nexpounded it to me: I have a fancy for the subject, and I want Bardo\r\nand his daughter to sit for it. Now, you ask them; and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll put\r\nthe likeness into Ariadne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed, if I can prevail with them. And your price for the Bacchus and\r\nAriadne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Baie_! If you get them to let me paint them, that will pay me. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather not have your money: you may pay for the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when shall I sit for you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if we have one\r\nlikeness, we must have two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want _your_ likeness; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, \xe2\x80\x9conly\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve made you look frightened. I must take the fright out of it for\r\nBacchus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he was speaking, Piero laid down the book and went to look among\r\nsome paintings, propped with their faces against the wall. He returned\r\nwith an oil-sketch in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call this as good a bit of portrait as I ever did,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking\r\nat it as he advanced. \xe2\x80\x9cYours is a face that expresses fear well,\r\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s naturally a bright one. I noticed it the first time I saw\r\nyou. The rest of the picture is hardly sketched; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve painted _you_\r\nin thoroughly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiero turned the sketch, and held it towards Tito\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He saw\r\nhimself with his right-hand uplifted, holding a wine-cup, in the\r\nattitude of triumphant joy, but with his face turned away from the cup\r\nwith an expression of such intense fear in the dilated eyes and pallid\r\nlips, that he felt a cold stream through his veins, as if he were being\r\nthrown into sympathy with his imaged self.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are beginning to look like it already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, with a short\r\nlaugh, moving the picture away again. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s seeing a ghost\xe2\x80\x94that fine\r\nyoung man. I shall finish it some day, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve settled what sort of\r\nghost is the most terrible\xe2\x80\x94whether it should look solid, like a dead\r\nman come to life, or half transparent, like a mist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, rather ashamed of himself for a sudden sensitiveness strangely\r\nopposed to his usual easy self-command, said carelessly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a subject after your own heart, Messer Piero\xe2\x80\x94a revel\r\ninterrupted by a ghost. You seem to love the blending of the terrible\r\nwith the gay. I suppose that is the reason your shelves are so well\r\nfurnished with death\xe2\x80\x99s-heads, while you are painting those roguish\r\nLoves who are running away with the armour of Mars. I begin to think\r\nyou are a Cynic philosopher in the pleasant disguise of a cunning\r\npainter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, Messer Greco; a philosopher is the last sort of animal I should\r\nchoose to resemble. I find it enough to live, without spinning lies to\r\naccount for life. Fowls cackle, asses bray, women chatter, and\r\nphilosophers spin false reasons\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the effect the sight of the\r\nworld brings out of them. Well, I am an animal that paints instead of\r\ncackling, or braying, or spinning lies. And now, I think, our business\r\nis done; you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep to your side of the bargain about the Oedipus and\r\nAntigone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do my best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito\xe2\x80\x94on this strong hint, immediately moving\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me know at Nello\xe2\x80\x99s. No need to come here again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, laughingly, lifting his hand in sign of\r\nfriendly parting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nThe Old Man\xe2\x80\x99s Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo del Nero was as inexorable as Romola had expected in\r\nhis advice that the marriage should be deferred till Easter, and in\r\nthis matter Bardo was entirely under the ascendancy of his sagacious\r\nand practical friend. Nevertheless, Bernardo himself, though he was as\r\nfar as ever from any susceptibility to the personal fascination in Tito\r\nwhich was felt by others, could not altogether resist that argument of\r\nsuccess which is always powerful with men of the world. Tito was making\r\nhis way rapidly in high quarters. He was especially growing in favour\r\nwith the young Cardinal Giovanni de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, who had even spoken of\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s forming part of his learned retinue on an approaching journey to\r\nRome; and the bright young Greek who had a tongue that was always ready\r\nwithout ever being quarrelsome, was more and more wished for at gay\r\nsuppers in the Via Larga, and at Florentine games in which he had no\r\npretension to excel, and could admire the incomparable skill of Piero\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Medici in the most graceful manner in the world. By an unfailing\r\nsequence, Tito\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as an agreeable companion in \xe2\x80\x9cmagnificent\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsociety made his learning and talent appear more lustrous: and he was\r\nreally accomplished enough to prevent an exaggerated estimate from\r\nbeing hazardous to him. Messer Bernardo had old prejudices and\r\nattachments which now began to argue down the newer and feebler\r\nprejudice against the young Greek stranger who was rather too supple.\r\nTo the old Florentine it was impossible to despise the recommendation\r\nof standing well with the best Florentine families, and since Tito\r\nbegan to be thoroughly received into that circle whose views were the\r\nunquestioned standard of social value, it seemed irrational not to\r\nadmit that there was no longer any check to satisfaction in the\r\nprospect of such a son-in-law for Bardo, and such a husband for Romola.\r\nIt was undeniable that Tito\xe2\x80\x99s coming had been the dawn of a new life\r\nfor both father and daughter, and the first promise had even been\r\nsurpassed. The blind old scholar\xe2\x80\x94whose proud truthfulness would never\r\nenter into that commerce of feigned and preposterous admiration which,\r\nvaried by a corresponding measurelessness in vituperation, made the\r\nwoof of all learned intercourse\xe2\x80\x94had fallen into neglect even among his\r\nfellow-citizens, and when he was alluded to at all, it had long been\r\nusual to say that, though his blindness and the loss of his son were\r\npitiable misfortunes, he was tiresome in contending for the value of\r\nhis own labours; and that his discontent was a little inconsistent in a\r\nman who had been openly regardless of religious rites, and who in days\r\npast had refused offers made to him from various quarters, on the\r\nslight condition that he would take orders, without which it was not\r\neasy for patrons to provide for every scholar. But since Tito\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\r\nthere was no longer the same monotony in the thought that Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nsuggested; the old man, it was understood, had left off his plaints,\r\nand the fair daughter was no longer to be shut up in dowerless pride,\r\nwaiting for a _parentado_. The winning manners and growing favour of\r\nthe handsome Greek who was expected to enter into the double relation\r\nof son and husband helped to make the new interest a thoroughly\r\nfriendly one, and it was no longer a rare occurrence when a visitor\r\nenlivened the quiet library. Elderly men came from that indefinite\r\nprompting to renew former intercourse which arises when an old\r\nacquaintance begins to be newly talked about; and young men whom Tito\r\nhad asked leave to bring once, found it easy to go again when they\r\novertook him on his way to the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and, resting their hands\r\non his shoulder, fell into easy chat with him. For it was pleasant to\r\nlook at Romola\xe2\x80\x99s beauty; to see her, like old Firenzuola\xe2\x80\x99s type of\r\nwomanly majesty, \xe2\x80\x9csitting with a certain grandeur, speaking with\r\ngravity, smiling with modesty, and casting around, as it were, an odour\r\nof queenliness;\xe2\x80\x9d[1] and she seemed to unfold like a strong white lily\r\nunder this genial breath of admiration and homage; it was all one to\r\nher with her new bright life in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s love.\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9cQuando una donna \xc3\xa8 grande, ben formata, porta ben sua persona,\r\n siede con una certa grandezza, parla con gravit\xc3\xa0, ride con modestia, e\r\n finalmente getta quasi un odor di Regina; allora noi diciamo quella\r\n donna pare una maest\xc3\xa0, ella ha una maest\xc3\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Firenzuola: _Della\r\n Bellezza delle Donne_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTito had even been the means of strengthening the hope in Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nthat he might before his death receive the longed-for security\r\nconcerning his library: that it should not be merged in another\r\ncollection; that it should not be transferred to a body of monks, and\r\nbe called by the name of a monastery; but that it should remain for\r\never the Bardi Library, for the use of Florentines. For the old habit\r\nof trusting in the Medici could not die out while their influence was\r\nstill the strongest lever in the State; and Tito, once possessing the\r\near of the Cardinal Giovanni de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, might do more even than Messer\r\nBernardo towards winning the desired interest, for he could demonstrate\r\nto a learned audience the peculiar value of Bardi\xe2\x80\x99s collection. Tito\r\nhimself talked sanguinely of such a result, willing to cheer the old\r\nman, and conscious that Romola repaid those gentle words to her father\r\nwith a sort of adoration that no direct tribute to herself could have\r\nwon from her.\r\n\r\nThis question of the library was the subject of more than one\r\ndiscussion with Bernardo del Nero when Christmas was turned and the\r\nprospect of the marriage was becoming near\xe2\x80\x94but always out of Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhearing. For Bardo nursed a vague belief, which they dared not disturb,\r\nthat his property, apart from the library, was adequate to meet all\r\ndemands. He would not even, except under a momentary pressure of angry\r\ndespondency, admit to himself that the will by which he had\r\ndisinherited Dino would leave Romola the heir of nothing but debts; or\r\nthat he needed anything from patronage beyond the security that a\r\nseparate locality should be assigned to his library, in return for a\r\ndeed of gift by which he made it over to the Florentine Republic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo to Romola, in a consultation they had\r\nunder the loggia, \xe2\x80\x9cthat since you are to be married, and Messer Tito\r\nwill have a competent income, we should begin to wind up the affairs,\r\nand ascertain exactly the sum that would be necessary to save the\r\nlibrary from being touched, instead of letting the debts accumulate any\r\nlonger. Your father needs nothing but his shred of mutton and his\r\nmacaroni every day, and I think Messer Tito may engage to supply that\r\nfor the years that remain; he can let it be in place of the\r\n_morgen-cap_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito has always known that my life is bound up with my father\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRomola; \xe2\x80\x9cand he is better to my father than I am: he delights in making\r\nhim happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99s not made of the same clay as other men, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBernardo, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThy father has thought of shutting woman\xe2\x80\x99s folly\r\nout of thee by cramming thee with Greek and Latin; but thou hast been\r\nas ready to believe in the first pair of bright eyes and the first soft\r\nwords that have come within reach of thee, as if thou couldst say\r\nnothing by heart but Paternosters, like other Christian men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, shaking her head playfully, \xe2\x80\x9cas if it\r\nwere only bright eyes and soft words that made me love Tito! You know\r\nbetter. You know I love my father and you because you are both good,\r\nand I love Tito too because he is so good. I see it, I feel it, in\r\neverything he says and does. And if he is handsome, too, why should I\r\nnot love him the better for that? It seems to me beauty is part of the\r\nfinished language by which goodness speaks. You know _you_ must have\r\nbeen a very handsome youth, godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she looked up with one of her\r\nhappy, loving smiles at the stately old man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou were about as tall as\r\nTito, and you had very fine eyes; only you looked a little sterner and\r\nprouder, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Romola likes to have all the pride to herself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, not\r\ninaccessible to this pretty coaxing. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it is well that in one\r\nway Tito\xe2\x80\x99s demands are more modest than those of any Florentine husband\r\nof fitting rank that we should have been likely to find for you; he\r\nwants no dowry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it was settled in that way between Messer Bernardo del Nero, Romola,\r\nand Tito. Bardo assented with a wave of the hand when Bernardo told him\r\nthat he thought it would be well now to begin to sell property and\r\nclear off debts; being accustomed to think of debts and property as a\r\nsort of thick wood that his imagination never even penetrated, still\r\nless got beyond. And Tito set about winning Messer Bernardo\xe2\x80\x99s respect\r\nby inquiring, with his ready faculty, into Florentine money-matters,\r\nthe secrets of the _Monti_ or public funds, the values of real\r\nproperty, and the profits of banking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will soon forget that Tito is not a Florentine, godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRomola. \xe2\x80\x9cSee how he is learning everything about Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me he is one of the _demoni_, who are of no particular\r\ncountry, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cHis mind is a little too\r\nnimble to be weighted with all the stuff we men carry about in our\r\nhearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola smiled too, in happy confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nThe Day of the Betrothal.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the last week of the Carnival, and the streets of Florence were\r\nat their fullest and noisiest: there were the masqued processions,\r\nchanting songs, indispensable now they had once been introduced by\r\nLorenzo the Magnificent; there was the favourite rigoletto, or round\r\ndance, footed \xe2\x80\x9cin piazza\xe2\x80\x9d under the blue frosty sky; there were\r\npractical jokes of all sorts, from throwing comfits to throwing\r\nstones\xe2\x80\x94especially stones. For the boys and striplings, always a strong\r\nelement in Florentine crowds, became at the height of Carnival-time as\r\nloud and unmanageable as tree-crickets, and it was their immemorial\r\nprivilege to bar the way with poles to all passengers, until a tribute\r\nhad been paid towards furnishing those lovers of strong sensations with\r\nsuppers and bonfires: to conclude with the standing entertainment of\r\nstone-throwing, which was not entirely monotonous, since the consequent\r\nmaiming was various, and it was not always a single person who was\r\nkilled. So that the pleasures of the Carnival were of a checkered kind,\r\nand if a painter were called upon to represent them truly, he would\r\nhave to make a picture in which there would be so much grossness and\r\nbarbarity that it must be turned with its face to the wall, except when\r\nit was taken down for the grave historical purpose of justifying a\r\nreforming zeal which, in ignorance of the facts, might be unfairly\r\ncondemned for its narrowness. Still there was much of that more\r\ninnocent picturesque merriment which is never wanting among a people\r\nwith quick animal spirits and sensitive organs: there was not the heavy\r\nsottishness which belongs to the thicker northern blood, nor the\r\nstealthy fierceness which in the more southern regions of the peninsula\r\nmakes the brawl lead to the dagger-thrust.\r\n\r\nIt was the high morning, but the merry spirits of the Carnival were\r\nstill inclined to lounge and recapitulate the last night\xe2\x80\x99s jests, when\r\nTito Melema was walking at a brisk pace on the way to the Via de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBardi. Young Bernardo Dovizi, who now looks at us out of Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait as the keen-eyed Cardinal da Bibbiena, was with him; and, as\r\nthey went, they held animated talk about some subject that had\r\nevidently no relation to the sights and sounds through which they were\r\npushing their way along the Por\xe2\x80\x99 Santa Maria. Nevertheless, as they\r\ndiscussed, smiled, and gesticulated, they both, from time to time, cast\r\nquick glances around them, and at the turning towards the Lung\xe2\x80\x99 Arno,\r\nleading to the Ponte Rubaconte, Tito had become aware, in one of these\r\nrapid surveys, that there was some one not far off him by whom he very\r\nmuch desired not to be recognised at that moment. His time and thoughts\r\nwere thoroughly preoccupied, for he was looking forward to a unique\r\noccasion in his life: he was preparing for his betrothal, which was to\r\ntake place on the evening of this very day. The ceremony had been\r\nresolved upon rather suddenly; for although preparations towards the\r\nmarriage had been going forward for some time\xe2\x80\x94chiefly in the\r\napplication of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s florins to the fitting up of rooms in Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndwelling, which, the library excepted, had always been scantily\r\nfurnished\xe2\x80\x94it had been intended to defer both the betrothal and the\r\nmarriage until after Easter, when Tito\xe2\x80\x99s year of probation, insisted on\r\nby Bernardo del Nero, would have been complete. But when an express\r\nproposition had come, that Tito should follow the Cardinal Giovanni to\r\nRome to help Bernardo Dovizi with his superior knowledge of Greek in\r\narranging a library, and there was no possibility of declining what lay\r\nso plainly on the road to advancement, he had become urgent in his\r\nentreaties that the betrothal might take place before his departure:\r\nthere would be the less delay before the marriage on his return, and it\r\nwould be less painful to part if he and Romola were outwardly as well\r\nas inwardly pledged to each other\xe2\x80\x94if he had a claim which defied Messer\r\nBernardo or any one else to nullify it. For the betrothal, at which\r\nrings were exchanged and mutual contracts were signed, made more than\r\nhalf the legality of marriage, to be completed on a separate occasion\r\nby the nuptial benediction. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s feeling had met Tito\xe2\x80\x99s in this\r\nwish, and the consent of the elders had been won.\r\n\r\nAnd now Tito was hastening, amidst arrangements for his departure the\r\nnext day, to snatch a morning visit to Romola, to say and hear any last\r\nwords that were needful to be said before their meeting for the\r\nbetrothal in the evening. It was not a time when any recognition could\r\nbe pleasant that was at all likely to detain him; still less a\r\nrecognition by Tessa. And it was unmistakably Tessa whom he had caught\r\nsight of moving along, with a timid and forlorn look, towards that very\r\nturn of the Lung\xe2\x80\x99 Arno which he was just rounding. As he continued his\r\ntalk with the young Dovizi, he had an uncomfortable undercurrent of\r\nconsciousness which told him that Tessa had seen him and would\r\ncertainly follow him: there was no escaping her along this direct road\r\nby the Arno, and over the Ponte Rubaconte. But she would not dare to\r\nspeak to him or approach him while he was not alone, and he would\r\ncontinue to keep Dovizi with him till they reached Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s door. He\r\nquickened his pace, and took up new threads of talk; but all the while\r\nthe sense that Tessa was behind him, though he had no physical evidence\r\nof the fact, grew stronger and stronger; it was very irritating\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nall the more so because a certain tenderness and pity for the poor\r\nlittle thing made the determination to escape without any visible\r\nnotice of her, a not altogether agreeable resource. Yet Tito persevered\r\nand carried his companion to the door, cleverly managing his \xe2\x80\x9caddio\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwithout turning his face in a direction where it was possible for him\r\nto see an importunate pair of blue eyes; and as he went up the stone\r\nsteps, he tried to get rid of unpleasant thoughts by saying to himself\r\nthat after all Tessa might not have seen him, or, if she had, might not\r\nhave followed him.\r\n\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because that possibility could not be relied on\r\nstrongly\xe2\x80\x94when the visit was over, he came out of the doorway with a\r\nquick step and an air of unconsciousness as to anything that might be\r\non his right-hand or his left. Our eyes are so constructed, however,\r\nthat they take in a wide angle without asking any leave of our will;\r\nand Tito knew that there was a little figure in a white hood standing\r\nnear the doorway\xe2\x80\x94knew it quite well, before he felt a hand laid on his\r\narm. It was a real grasp, and not a light, timid touch; for poor Tessa,\r\nseeing his rapid step, had started forward with a desperate effort. But\r\nwhen he stopped and turned towards her, her face wore a frightened\r\nlook, as if she dreaded the effect of her boldness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with more sharpness in his voice than she had ever\r\nheard in it before. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you here? You must not follow me\xe2\x80\x94you must\r\nnot stand about door-places waiting for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer blue eyes widened with tears, and she said nothing. Tito was afraid\r\nof something worse than ridicule, if he were seen in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi\r\nwith a girlish contadina looking pathetically at him. It was a street\r\nof high silent-looking dwellings, not of traffic; but Bernardo del\r\nNero, or some one almost as dangerous, might come up at any moment.\r\nEven if it had not been the day of his betrothal, the incident would\r\nhave been awkward and annoying. Yet it would be brutal\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nimpossible\xe2\x80\x94to drive Tessa away with harsh words. That accursed folly of\r\nhis with the _cerretano_\xe2\x80\x94that it should have lain buried in a quiet way\r\nfor months, and now start up before him as this unseasonable crop of\r\nvexation! He could not speak harshly, but he spoke hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa, I cannot\xe2\x80\x94must not talk to you here. I will go on to the bridge\r\nand wait for you there. Follow me slowly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked fast to the Ponte Rubaconte, and there leaned\r\nagainst the wall of one of the quaint little houses that rise at even\r\ndistances on the bridge, looking towards the way by which Tessa would\r\ncome. It would have softened a much harder heart than Tito\xe2\x80\x99s to see the\r\nlittle thing advancing with her round face much paled and saddened\r\nsince he had parted from it at the door of the \xe2\x80\x9cNunziata.\xe2\x80\x9d Happily it\r\nwas the least frequented of the bridges, and there were scarcely any\r\npassengers on it at this moment. He lost no time in speaking as soon as\r\nshe came near him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Tessa, I have very little time. You must not cry. Why did you\r\nfollow me this morning? You must not do so again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, speaking in a whisper, and struggling against\r\na sob that _would_ rise immediately at this new voice of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so long before you came to take care of me\r\nagain. And the _patrigno_ beats me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it any longer. And\r\nalways when I come for a holiday I walk about to find you, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nOh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t send me away from you again! It has been so long, and\r\nI cry so now, because you never come to me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, for the\r\ndays are so long, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind about the goats and kids, or\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sobs came fast now, and the great tears. Tito felt that he could\r\nnot do otherwise than comfort her. Send her away\xe2\x80\x94yes; that he _must_\r\ndo, at once. But it was all the more impossible to tell her anything\r\nthat would leave her in a state of hopeless grief. He saw new trouble\r\nin the background, but the difficulty of the moment was too pressing\r\nfor him to weigh distant consequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa, my little one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his old caressing tones, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\nnot cry. Bear with the cross _patrigno_ a little longer. I will come\r\nback to you. But I\xe2\x80\x99m going now to Rome\xe2\x80\x94a long, long way off. I shall\r\ncome back in a few weeks, and then I promise you to come and see you.\r\nPromise me to be good and wait for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the well-remembered voice again, and the mere sound was half\r\nenough to soothe Tessa. She looked up at him with trusting eyes, that\r\nstill glittered with tears, sobbing all the while, in spite of her\r\nutmost efforts to obey him. Again he said, in a gentle voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromise me, my Tessa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t be long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not long. But I must _go now_. And remember what I told you,\r\nTessa. Nobody must know that you ever see me, else you will lose me for\r\never. And now, when I have left you, go straight home, and never follow\r\nme again. Wait till I come to you. Good-bye, my little Tessa: I _will_\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it; he must turn and leave her without looking\r\nbehind him to see how she bore it, for he had no time to spare. When he\r\ndid look round he was in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Benci, where there was no seeing\r\nwhat was happening on the bridge; but Tessa was too trusting and\r\nobedient not to do just what he had told her.\r\n\r\nYes, the difficulty was at an end for that day; yet this return of\r\nTessa to him, at a moment when it was impossible for him to put an end\r\nto all difficulty with her by undeceiving her, was an unpleasant\r\nincident to carry in his memory. But Tito\xe2\x80\x99s mind was just now\r\nthoroughly penetrated with a hopeful first love, associated with all\r\nhappy prospects flattering to his ambition; and that future necessity\r\nof grieving Tessa could be scarcely more to him than the far-off cry of\r\nsome little suffering animal buried in the thicket, to a merry\r\ncavalcade in the sunny plain. When, for the second time that day, Tito\r\nwas hastening across the Ponte Rubaconte, the thought of Tessa caused\r\nno perceptible diminution of his happiness. He was well muffled in his\r\nmantle, less, perhaps, to protect him from the cold than from the\r\nadditional notice that would have been drawn upon him by his dainty\r\napparel. He leaped up the stone steps by two at a time, and said\r\nhurriedly to Maso, who met him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the damigella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the library; she is quite ready, and Monna Brigida and Messer\r\nBernardo are already there with Ser Braccio, but none of the rest of\r\nthe company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk her to give me a few minutes alone; I will await her in the\r\n_salotto_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito entered a room which had been fitted up in the utmost contrast\r\nwith the half-pallid, half-sombre tints of the library. The walls were\r\nbrightly frescoed with \xe2\x80\x9ccaprices\xe2\x80\x9d of nymphs and loves sporting under\r\nthe blue among flowers and birds. The only furniture besides the red\r\nleather seats and the central table were two tall white vases, and a\r\nyoung faun playing the flute, modelled by a promising youth named\r\nMichelangelo Buonarotti. It was a room that gave a sense of being in\r\nthe sunny open air.\r\n\r\nTito kept his mantle round him, and looked towards the door. It was not\r\nlong before Romola entered, all white and gold, more than ever like a\r\ntall lily. Her white silk garment was bound by a golden girdle, which\r\nfell with large tassels; and above that was the rippling gold of her\r\nhair, surmounted by the white mist of her long veil, which was fastened\r\non her brow by a band of pearls, the gift of Bernardo del Nero, and was\r\nnow parted off her face so that it all floated backward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegina mia!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, as he took her hand and kissed it, still\r\nkeeping his mantle round him. He could not help going backward to look\r\nat her again, while she stood in calm delight, with that exquisite\r\nself-consciousness which rises under the gaze of admiring love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola, will you show me the next room now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, checking\r\nhimself with the remembrance that the time might be short. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said I\r\nshould see it when you had arranged everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout speaking, she led the way into a long narrow room, painted\r\nbrightly like the other, but only with birds and flowers. The furniture\r\nin it was all old; there were old faded objects for feminine use or\r\nornament, arranged in an open cabinet between the two narrow windows;\r\nabove the cabinet was the portrait of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s mother; and below this,\r\non the top of the cabinet, stood the crucifix which Romola had brought\r\nfrom San Marco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought something under my mantle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, smiling; and\r\nthrowing off the large loose garment, he showed the little tabernacle\r\nwhich had been painted by Piero di Cosimo. The painter had carried out\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s intention charmingly, and so far had atoned for his long delay.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what this is for, my Romola?\xe2\x80\x9d added Tito, taking her by\r\nthe hand, and leading her towards the cabinet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a little shrine,\r\nwhich is to hide away from you for ever that remembrancer of sadness.\r\nYou have done with sadness now; and we will bury all images of it\xe2\x80\x94bury\r\nthem in a tomb of joy. See!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight quiver passed across Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face as Tito took hold of the\r\ncrucifix. But she had no wish to prevent his purpose; on the contrary,\r\nshe herself wished to subdue certain importunate memories and\r\nquestionings which still flitted like unexplained shadows across her\r\nhappier thought.\r\n\r\nHe opened the triptych and placed the crucifix within the central\r\nspace; then closing it again, taking out the key, and setting the\r\nlittle tabernacle in the spot where the crucifix had stood, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Romola, look and see if you are satisfied with the portraits old\r\nPiero has made of us. Is it not a dainty device? and the credit of\r\nchoosing it is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is you\xe2\x80\x94it is perfect!\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, looking with moist joyful\r\neyes at the miniature Bacchus, with his purple clusters. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am\r\nAriadne, and you are crowning me! Yes, it is true, Tito; you have\r\ncrowned my poor life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey held each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands while she spoke, and both looked at their\r\nimaged selves. But the reality was far more beautiful; she all\r\nlily-white and golden, and he with his dark glowing beauty above the\r\npurple red-bordered tunic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was our good strange Piero who painted it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cDid\r\nyou put it into his head to paint me as Antigone, that he might have my\r\nlikeness for this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was he who made my getting leave for him to paint you and your\r\nfather, a condition of his doing this for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I see now what it was you gave up your precious ring for. I\r\nperceived you had some cunning plan to give me pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito did not blench. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s little illusions about himself had long\r\nceased to cause him anything but satisfaction. He only smiled and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have spared my ring; Piero will accept no money from me; he\r\nthinks himself paid by painting you. And now, while I am away, you will\r\nlook every day at those pretty symbols of our life together\xe2\x80\x94the ship on\r\nthe calm sea, and the ivy that never withers, and those Loves that have\r\nleft off wounding us and shower soft petals that are like our kisses;\r\nand the leopards and tigers, they are the troubles of your life that\r\nare all quelled now; and the strange sea-monsters, with their merry\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94let us see\xe2\x80\x94they are the dull passages in the heavy books, which\r\nhave begun to be amusing since we have sat by each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito mio!\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in a half-laughing voice of love; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nwill give me the key?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, holding out her hand for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with playful decision, opening his scarsella\r\nand dropping in the little key. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall drown it in the Arno.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I ever wanted to look at the crucifix again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! for that very reason it is hidden\xe2\x80\x94hidden by these images of youth\r\nand joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed a light kiss on her brow, and she said no more, ready to\r\nsubmit, like all strong souls, when she felt no valid reason for\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nAnd then they joined the waiting company, which made a dignified little\r\nprocession as it passed along the Ponte Rubaconte towards Santa Croce.\r\nSlowly it passed, for Bardo, unaccustomed for years to leave his own\r\nhouse, walked with a more timid step than usual; and that slow pace\r\nsuited well with the gouty dignity of Messer Bartolommeo Scala, who\r\ngraced the occasion by his presence, along with his daughter\r\nAlessandra. It was customary to have very long troops of kindred and\r\nfriends at the _sposalizio_, or betrothal, and it had even been found\r\nnecessary in time past to limit the number by law to no more than _four\r\nhundred_\xe2\x80\x94two hundred on each side; for since the guests were all\r\nfeasted after this initial ceremony, as well as after the _nozze_, or\r\nmarriage, the very first stage of matrimony had become a ruinous\r\nexpense, as that scholarly Benedict, Leonardo Bruno, complained in his\r\nown case. But Bardo, who in his poverty had kept himself proudly free\r\nfrom any appearance of claiming the advantages attached to a powerful\r\nfamily name, would have no invitations given on the strength of mere\r\nfriendship; and the modest procession of twenty that followed the\r\n_sposi_ were, with three or four exceptions, friends of Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s selected on personal grounds.\r\n\r\nBernardo del Nero walked as a vanguard before Bardo, who was led on the\r\nright by Tito, while Romola held her father\xe2\x80\x99s other hand. Bardo had\r\nhimself been married at Santa Croce, and had insisted on Romola\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nbetrothed and married there, rather than in the little church of Santa\r\nLucia close by their house, because he had a complete mental vision of\r\nthe grand church where he hoped that a burial might be granted him\r\namong the Florentines who had deserved well. Happily the way was short\r\nand direct, and lay aloof from the loudest riot of the Carnival, if\r\nonly they could return before any dances or shows began in the great\r\npiazza of Santa Croce. The west was red as they passed the bridge, and\r\nshed a mellow light on the pretty procession, which had a touch of\r\nsolemnity in the presence of the blind father. But when the ceremony\r\nwas over, and Tito and Romola came out on to the broad steps of the\r\nchurch, with the golden links of destiny on their fingers, the evening\r\nhad deepened into struggling starlight, and the servants had their\r\ntorches lit.\r\n\r\nWhile they came out, a strange dreary chant, as of a _Miserere_, met\r\ntheir ears, and they saw that at the extreme end of the piazza there\r\nseemed to be a stream of people impelled by something approaching from\r\nthe Borgo de\xe2\x80\x99 Greci.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is one of their masqued processions, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, who was\r\nnow alone with Romola, while Bernardo took charge of Bardo.\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke there came slowly into view, at a height far above the\r\nheads of the onlookers, a huge and ghastly image of Winged Time with\r\nhis scythe and hour-glass, surrounded by his winged children, the\r\nHours. He was mounted on a high car completely covered with black, and\r\nthe bullocks that drew the car were also covered with black, their\r\nhorns alone standing out white above the gloom; so that in the sombre\r\nshadow of the houses it seemed to those at a distance as if Time and\r\nhis children were apparitions floating through the air. And behind them\r\ncame what looked like a troop of the sheeted dead gliding above\r\nblackness. And as they glided slowly, they chanted in a wailing strain.\r\n\r\nA cold horror seized on Romola, for at the first moment it seemed as if\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s vision, which could never be effaced from her mind, was\r\nbeing half fulfilled. She clung to Tito, who, divining what was in her\r\nthoughts, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dismal fooling sometimes pleases your Florentines! Doubtless this\r\nis an invention of Piero di Cosimo, who loves such grim merriment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, I wish it had not happened. It will deepen the images of that\r\nvision which I would fain be rid of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Romola, you will look only at the images of our happiness now. I\r\nhave locked all sadness away from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is still there\xe2\x80\x94it is only hidden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in a low tone,\r\nhardly conscious that she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, they are all gone now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will forget this ghastly\r\nmummery when we are in the light, and can see each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. My\r\nAriadne must never look backward now\xe2\x80\x94only forward to Easter, when she\r\nwill triumph with her Care-dispeller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nFlorence expects a Guest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the 17th of November 1494: more than eighteen months since Tito\r\nand Romola had been finally united in the joyous Easter time, and had\r\nhad a rainbow-tinted shower of comfits thrown over them, after the\r\nancient Greek fashion, in token that the heavens would shower sweets on\r\nthem through all their double life.\r\n\r\nSince that Easter a great change had come over the prospects of\r\nFlorence; and as in the tree that bears a myriad of blossoms, each\r\nsingle bud with its fruit is dependent on the primary circulation of\r\nthe sap, so the fortunes of Tito and Romola were dependent on certain\r\ngrand political and social conditions which made an epoch in the\r\nhistory of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn this very November, little more than a week ago, the spirit of the\r\nold centuries seemed to have re-entered the breasts of Florentines. The\r\ngreat bell in the palace tower had rung out the hammer-sound of alarm,\r\nand the people had mustered with their rusty arms, their tools and\r\nimpromptu cudgels, to drive out the Medici. The gate of San Gallo had\r\nbeen fairly shut on the arrogant, exasperating Piero, galloping away\r\ntowards Bologna with his hired horsemen frightened behind him, and shut\r\non his keener young brother, the cardinal, escaping in the disguise of\r\na Franciscan monk: a price had been set on both their heads. After\r\nthat, there had been some sacking of houses, according to old\r\nprecedent; the ignominious images, painted on the public buildings, of\r\nthe men who had conspired against the Medici in days gone by, were\r\neffaced; the exiled enemies of the Medici were invited home. The\r\nhalf-fledged tyrants were fairly out of their splendid nest in the Via\r\nLarga, and the Republic had recovered the use of its will again.\r\n\r\nBut now, a week later, the great palace in the Via Larga had been\r\nprepared for the reception of another tenant; and if drapery roofing\r\nthe streets with unwonted colour, if banners and hangings pouring out\r\nof the windows, if carpets and tapestry stretched over all steps and\r\npavement on which exceptional feet might tread, were an unquestionable\r\nproof of joy, Florence was very joyful in the expectation of its new\r\nguest. The stream of colour flowed from the palace in the Via Larga\r\nround by the Cathedral, then by the great Piazza della Signoria, and\r\nacross the Ponte Vecchio to the Porta San Frediano\xe2\x80\x94the gate that looks\r\ntowards Pisa. There, near the gate, a platform and canopy had been\r\nerected for the Signoria; and Messer Luca Corsini, doctor of law, felt\r\nhis heart palpitating a little with the sense that he had a Latin\r\noration to read; and every chief elder in Florence had to make himself\r\nready, with smooth chin and well-lined silk lucco, to walk in\r\nprocession; and the well-born youths were looking at their rich new\r\ntunics after the French mode which was to impress the stranger as\r\nhaving a peculiar grace when worn by Florentines; and a large body of\r\nthe clergy, from the archbishop in his effulgence to the train of\r\nmonks, black, white, and grey, were consulting betimes in the morning\r\nhow they should marshal themselves, with their burden of relics and\r\nsacred banners and consecrated jewels, that their movements might be\r\nadjusted to the expected arrival of the illustrious visitor, at three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAn unexampled visitor! For he had come through the passes of the Alps\r\nwith such an army as Italy had not seen before: with thousands of\r\nterrible Swiss, well used to fight for love and hatred as well as for\r\nhire; with a host of gallant cavaliers proud of a name; with an\r\nunprecedented infantry, in which every man in a hundred carried an\r\narquebus; nay, with cannon of bronze, shooting not stones but iron\r\nballs, drawn not by bullocks but by horses, and capable of firing a\r\nsecond time before a city could mend the breach made by the first ball.\r\nSome compared the new-comer to Charlemagne, reputed rebuilder of\r\nFlorence, welcome conqueror of degenerate kings, regulator and\r\nbenefactor of the Church; some preferred the comparison to Cyrus,\r\nliberator of the chosen people, restorer of the Temple. For he had come\r\nacross the Alps with the most glorious projects: he was to march\r\nthrough Italy amidst the jubilees of a grateful and admiring people; he\r\nwas to satisfy all conflicting complaints at Rome; he was to take\r\npossession, by virtue of hereditary right and a little fighting, of the\r\nkingdom of Naples; and from that convenient starting-point he was to\r\nset out on the conquest of the Turks, who were partly to be cut to\r\npieces and partly converted to the faith of Christ. It was a scheme\r\nthat seemed to befit the Most Christian King, head of a nation which,\r\nthanks to the devices of a subtle Louis the Eleventh who had died in\r\nmuch fright as to his personal prospects ten years before, had become\r\nthe strongest of Christian monarchies; and this antitype of Cyrus and\r\nCharlemagne was no other than the son of that subtle Louis\xe2\x80\x94the young\r\nCharles the Eighth of France.\r\n\r\nSurely, on a general statement, hardly anything could seem more\r\ngrandiose, or fitter to revive in the breasts of men the memory of\r\ngreat dispensations by which new strata had been laid in the history of\r\nmankind. And there was a very widely spread conviction that the advent\r\nof the French king and his army into Italy was one of those events at\r\nwhich marble statues might well be believed to perspire, phantasmal\r\nfiery warriors to fight in the air, and quadrupeds to bring forth\r\nmonstrous births\xe2\x80\x94that it did not belong to the usual order of\r\nProvidence, but was in a peculiar sense the work of God. It was a\r\nconviction that rested less on the necessarily momentous character of a\r\npowerful foreign invasion than on certain moral emotions to which the\r\naspect of the times gave the form of presentiments: emotions which had\r\nfound a very remarkable utterance in the voice of a single man.\r\n\r\nThat man was Fra Girolamo Savonarola, Prior of the Dominican convent of\r\nSan Marco in Florence. On a September morning, when men\xe2\x80\x99s ears were\r\nringing with the news that the French army had entered Italy, he had\r\npreached in the Cathedral of Florence from the text, \xe2\x80\x9cBehold I, even I,\r\ndo bring a flood of waters upon the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d He believed it was by\r\nsupreme guidance that he had reached just so far in his exposition of\r\nGenesis the previous Lent; and he believed the \xe2\x80\x9cflood of water\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94emblem\r\nat once of avenging wrath and purifying mercy\xe2\x80\x94to be the\r\ndivinely\xe2\x80\x94indicated symbol of the French army. His audience, some of\r\nwhom were held to be among the choicest spirits of the age\xe2\x80\x94the most\r\ncultivated men in the most cultivated of Italian cities\xe2\x80\x94believed it\r\ntoo, and listened with shuddering awe. For this man had a power rarely\r\nparalleled, of impressing his beliefs on others, and of swaying very\r\nvarious minds. And as long as four years ago he had proclaimed from the\r\nchief pulpit of Florence that a scourge was about to descend on Italy,\r\nand that by this scourge the Church was to be purified. Savonarola\r\nappeared to believe, and his hearers more or less waveringly believed,\r\nthat he had a mission like that of the Hebrew prophets, and that the\r\nFlorentines amongst whom his message was delivered were in some sense a\r\nsecond chosen people. The idea of prophetic gifts was not a remote one\r\nin that age: seers of visions, circumstantial heralds of things to be,\r\nwere far from uncommon either outside or inside the cloister; but this\r\nvery fact made Savonarola stand out the more conspicuously as a grand\r\nexception. While in others the gift of prophecy was very much like a\r\nfarthing candle illuminating small corners of human destiny with\r\nprophetic gossip, in Savonarola it was like a mighty beacon shining far\r\nout for the warning and guidance of men. And to some of the soberest\r\nminds the supernatural character of his insight into the future\r\ngathered a strong attestation from the peculiar conditions of the age.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1492, the year in which Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici died and\r\nTito Melema came as a wanderer to Florence, Italy was enjoying a peace\r\nand prosperity unthreatened by any near and definite danger. There was\r\nno fear of famine, for the seasons had been plenteous in corn, and\r\nwine, and oil; new palaces had been rising in all fair cities, new\r\nvillas on pleasant slopes and summits; and the men who had more than\r\ntheir share of these good things were in no fear of the larger number\r\nwho had less. For the citizens\xe2\x80\x99 armour was getting rusty, and\r\npopulations seemed to have become tame, licking the hands of masters\r\nwho paid for a ready-made army when they wanted it, as they paid for\r\ngoods of Smyrna. Even the fear of the Turk had ceased to be active, and\r\nthe Pope found it more immediately profitable to accept bribes from him\r\nfor a little prospective poisoning than to form plans either for\r\nconquering or for converting him.\r\n\r\nAltogether this world, with its partitioned empire and its roomy\r\nuniversal Church, seemed to be a handsome establishment for the few who\r\nwere lucky or wise enough to reap the advantages of human folly: a\r\nworld in which lust and obscenity, lying and treachery, oppression and\r\nmurder, were pleasant, useful, and when properly managed, not\r\ndangerous. And as a sort of fringe or adornment to the substantial\r\ndelights of tyranny, avarice, and lasciviousness, there was the\r\npatronage of polite learning and the fine arts, so that flattery could\r\nalways be had in the choicest Latin to be commanded at that time, and\r\nsublime artists were at hand to paint the holy and the unclean with\r\nimpartial skill. The Church, it was said, had never been so disgraced\r\nin its head, had never shown so few signs of renovating, vital belief\r\nin its lower members; nevertheless it was much more prosperous than in\r\nsome past days. The heavens were fair and smiling above; and below\r\nthere were no signs of earthquake.\r\n\r\nYet at that time, as we have seen, there was a man in Florence who for\r\ntwo years and more had been preaching that a scourge was at hand; that\r\nthe world was certainly not framed for the lasting convenience of\r\nhypocrites, libertines, and oppressors. From the midst of those smiling\r\nheavens he had seen a sword hanging\xe2\x80\x94the sword of God\xe2\x80\x99s justice\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas speedily to descend with purifying punishment on the Church and the\r\nworld. In brilliant Ferrara, seventeen years before, the contradiction\r\nbetween men\xe2\x80\x99s lives and their professed beliefs had pressed upon him\r\nwith a force that had been enough to destroy his appetite for the\r\nworld, and at the age of twenty-three had driven him into the cloister.\r\nHe believed that God had committed to the Church the sacred lamp of\r\ntruth for the guidance and salvation of men, and he saw that the\r\nChurch, in its corruption, had become a sepulchre to hide the lamp. As\r\nthe years went on scandals increased and multiplied, and hypocrisy\r\nseemed to have given place to impudence. Had the world, then, ceased to\r\nhave a righteous Ruler? Was the Church finally forsaken? No, assuredly:\r\nin the Sacred Book there was a record of the past in which might be\r\nseen as in a glass what would be in the days to come, and the book\r\nshowed that when the wickedness of the chosen people, type of the\r\nChristian Church, had become crying, the judgments of God had descended\r\non them. Nay, reason itself declared that vengeance was imminent, for\r\nwhat else would suffice to turn men from their obstinacy in evil? And\r\nunless the Church were reclaimed, how could the promises be fulfilled,\r\nthat the heathens should be converted and the whole world become\r\nsubject to the one true law? He had seen his belief reflected in\r\nvisions\xe2\x80\x94a mode of seeing which had been frequent with him from his\r\nyouth up.\r\n\r\nBut the real force of demonstration for Girolamo Savonarola lay in his\r\nown burning indignation at the sight of wrong; in his fervent belief in\r\nan Unseen Justice that would put an end to the wrong, and in an Unseen\r\nPurity to which lying and uncleanness were an abomination. To his\r\nardent, power-loving soul, believing in great ends, and longing to\r\nachieve those ends by the exertion of its own strong will, the faith in\r\na supreme and righteous Ruler became one with the faith in a speedy\r\ndivine interposition that would punish and reclaim.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, under that splendid masquerade of dignities sacred and\r\nsecular which seemed to make the life of lucky Churchmen and princely\r\nfamilies so luxurious and amusing, there were certain conditions at\r\nwork which slowly tended to disturb the general festivity. Ludovico\r\nSforza\xe2\x80\x94copious in gallantry, splendid patron of an incomparable\r\nLeonardo da Vinci\xe2\x80\x94holding the ducal crown of Milan in his grasp, and\r\nwanting to put it on his own head rather than let it rest on that of a\r\nfeeble nephew who would take very little to poison him, was much afraid\r\nof the Spanish-born old King Ferdinand and the Crown Prince Alfonso of\r\nNaples, who, not liking cruelty and treachery which were useless to\r\nthemselves, objected to the poisoning of a near relative for the\r\nadvantage of a Lombard usurper; the royalties of Naples again were\r\nafraid of their suzerain, Pope Alexander Borgia; all three were\r\nanxiously watching Florence, lest with its midway territory it should\r\ndetermine the game by underhand backing; and all four, with every small\r\nstate in Italy, were afraid of Venice\xe2\x80\x94Venice the cautious, the stable,\r\nand the strong, that wanted to stretch its arms not only along both\r\nsides of the Adriatic but across to the ports of the western coast.\r\n\r\nLorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, it was thought, did much to prevent the fatal\r\noutbreak of such jealousies, keeping up the old Florentine alliance\r\nwith Naples and the Pope, and yet persuading Milan that the alliance\r\nwas for the general advantage. But young Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici\xe2\x80\x99s rash vanity\r\nhad quickly nullified the effect of his father\xe2\x80\x99s wary policy, and\r\nLudovico Sforza, roused to suspicion of a league against him, thought\r\nof a move which would checkmate his adversaries: he determined to\r\ninvite the French king to march into Italy, and, as heir of the house\r\nof Anjou, take possession of Naples. Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9corators,\xe2\x80\x9d as they\r\nwere called in those haranguing times\xe2\x80\x94went and came; a recusant\r\ncardinal, determined not to acknowledge a Pope elected by bribery (and\r\nhis own particular enemy), went and came also, and seconded the\r\ninvitation with hot rhetoric; and the young king seemed to lend a\r\nwilling ear. So that in 1493 the rumour spread and became louder and\r\nlouder that Charles the Eighth of France was about to cross the Alps\r\nwith a mighty army; and the Italian populations, accustomed, since\r\nItaly had ceased to be the heart of the Roman empire, to look for an\r\narbitrator from afar, began vaguely to regard his coming as a means of\r\navenging their wrongs and redressing their grievances.\r\n\r\nAnd in that rumour Savonarola had heard the assurance that his prophecy\r\nwas being verified. What was it that filled the ears of the prophets of\r\nold but the distant tread of foreign armies, coming to do the work of\r\njustice? He no longer looked vaguely to the horizon for the coming\r\nstorm: he pointed to the rising cloud. The French army was that new\r\ndeluge which was to purify the earth from iniquity; the French king,\r\nCharles the Eighth, was the instrument elected by God, as Cyrus had\r\nbeen of old, and all men who desired good rather than evil were to\r\nrejoice in his coming. For the scourge would fall destructively on the\r\nimpenitent alone. Let any city of Italy, let Florence above\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94Florence beloved of God, since to its ear the warning voice had\r\nbeen specially sent\xe2\x80\x94repent and turn from its ways, like Nineveh of old,\r\nand the storm-cloud would roll over it and leave only refreshing\r\nraindrops.\r\n\r\nFra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s word was powerful; yet now that the new Cyrus had\r\nalready been three months in Italy, and was not far from the gates of\r\nFlorence, his presence was expected there with mixed feelings, in which\r\nfear and distrust certainly predominated. At present it was not\r\nunderstood that he had redressed any grievances; and the Florentines\r\nclearly had nothing to thank him for. He held their strong frontier\r\nfortresses, which Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici had given up to him without securing\r\nany honourable terms in return; he had done nothing to quell the\r\nalarming revolt of Pisa, which had been encouraged by his presence to\r\nthrow off the Florentine yoke; and \xe2\x80\x9corators,\xe2\x80\x9d even with a prophet at\r\ntheir head, could win no assurance from him, except that he would\r\nsettle everything when he was once within the walls of Florence. Still,\r\nthere was the satisfaction of knowing that the exasperating Piero de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMedici had been fairly pelted out for the ignominious surrender of the\r\nfortresses, and in that act of energy the spirit of the Republic had\r\nrecovered some of its old fire.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the equivocal guest were not entirely those of a\r\ncity resigned to submission. Behind the bright drapery and banners\r\nsymbolical of joy, there were preparations of another sort made with\r\ncommon accord by government and people. Well hidden within walls there\r\nwere hired soldiers of the Republic, hastily called in from the\r\nsurrounding districts; there were old arms duly furbished, and sharp\r\ntools and heavy cudgels laid carefully at hand, to be snatched up on\r\nshort notice; there were excellent boards and stakes to form barricades\r\nupon occasion, and a good supply of stones to make a surprising hail\r\nfrom the upper windows. Above all, there were people very strongly in\r\nthe humour for fighting any personage who might be supposed to have\r\ndesigns of hectoring over them, they having lately tasted that new\r\npleasure with much relish. This humour was not diminished by the sight\r\nof occasional parties of Frenchmen, coming beforehand to choose their\r\nquarters, with a hawk, perhaps, on their left wrist, and,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, a piece of chalk in their right-hand to mark\r\nItalian doors withal; especially as creditable historians imply that\r\nmany sons of France were at that time characterised by something\r\napproaching to a swagger, which must have whetted the Florentine\r\nappetite for a little stone-throwing.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the temper of Florence on the morning of the 17th of\r\nNovember 1494.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nThe Prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sky was grey, but that made little difference in the Piazza del\r\nDuomo, which was covered with its holiday sky of blue drapery, and its\r\nconstellations of yellow lilies and coats of arms. The sheaves of\r\nbanners were unfurled at the angles of the Baptistery, but there was no\r\ncarpet yet on the steps of the Duomo, for the marble was being trodden\r\nby numerous feet that were not at all exceptional. It was the hour of\r\nthe Advent sermons, and the very same reasons which had flushed the\r\nstreets with holiday colour were reasons why the preaching in the Duomo\r\ncould least of all be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nBut not all the feet in the Piazza were hastening towards the steps.\r\nPeople of high and low degree were moving to and fro with the brisk\r\npace of men who had errands before them; groups of talkers were thickly\r\nscattered, some willing to be late for the sermon, and others content\r\nnot to hear it at all.\r\n\r\nThe expression on the faces of these apparent loungers was not that of\r\nmen who are enjoying the pleasant laziness of an opening holiday. Some\r\nwere in close and eager discussion; others were listening with keen\r\ninterest to a single spokesman, and yet from time to time turned round\r\nwith a scanning glance at any new passer-by. At the corner, looking\r\ntowards the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Cerretani\xe2\x80\x94just where the artificial rainbow light\r\nof the Piazza ceased, and the grey morning fell on the sombre stone\r\nhouses\xe2\x80\x94there was a remarkable cluster of the working people, most of\r\nthem bearing on their dress or persons the signs of their daily labour,\r\nand almost all of them carrying some weapon, or some tool which might\r\nserve as a weapon upon occasion. Standing in the grey light of the\r\nstreet, with bare brawny arms and soiled garments, they made all the\r\nmore striking the transition from the brightness of the Piazza. They\r\nwere listening to the thin notary, Ser Cioni, who had just paused on\r\nhis way to the Duomo. His biting words could get only a contemptuous\r\nreception two years and a half before in the Mercato, but now he spoke\r\nwith the more complacent humour of a man whose party is uppermost, and\r\nwho is conscious of some influence with the people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever talk to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, in his incisive voice, \xe2\x80\x9cnever talk\r\nto me of bloodthirsty Swiss or fierce French infantry: they might as\r\nwell be in the narrow passes of the mountains as in our streets; and\r\npeasants have destroyed the finest armies of our condottieri in time\r\npast, when they had once got them between steep precipices. I tell you,\r\nFlorentines need be afraid of no army in their own streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, Ser Cioni,\xe2\x80\x9d said a man whose arms and hands were\r\ndiscoloured by crimson dye, which looked like blood-stains, and who had\r\na small hatchet stuck in his belt; \xe2\x80\x9cand those French cavaliers, who\r\ncame in squaring themselves in their smart doublets the other day, saw\r\na sample of the dinner we could serve up for them. I was carrying my\r\ncloth in Ognissanti, when I saw my fine Messeri going by, looking round\r\nas if they thought the houses of the Vespucci and the Agli a poor pick\r\nof lodgings for them, and eyeing us Florentines, like top-knotted cocks\r\nas they are, as if they pitied us because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to strut.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my fine _Galli_,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98stick out your stomachs; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nmeat-axe in my belt that will go inside you all the easier;\xe2\x80\x99 when\r\npresently the old cow lowed,[1] and I knew something had happened\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nmatter what. So I threw my cloth in at the first doorway, and took hold\r\nof my meat-axe and ran after my fine cavaliers towards the Vigna Nuova.\r\nAnd, \xe2\x80\x98What is it, Guccio?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, when he came up with me. \xe2\x80\x98I think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the Medici coming back,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guccio. _Bemb\xc3\xa8_! I expected so! And\r\nup we reared a barricade, and the Frenchmen looked behind and saw\r\nthemselves in a trap; and up comes a good swarm of our _Ciompi_[2] and\r\none of them with a big scythe he had in his hand mowed off one of the\r\nfine cavalier\xe2\x80\x99s feathers:\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s true! And the lasses peppered a few\r\nstones down to frighten them. However, Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici wasn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nafter all; and it was a pity; for we\xe2\x80\x99d have left him neither legs nor\r\nwings to go away with again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9c_La vacca muglia_\xe2\x80\x9d was the phrase for the sounding of the great\r\n bell in the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] The poorer artisans connected with the wool trade\xe2\x80\x94wool-beaters,\r\n carders, washers, etcetera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell spoken, Oddo,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young butcher, with his knife at his belt;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief Piero will be a good while before he wants to come\r\nback, for he looked as frightened as a hunted chicken, when we hustled\r\nand pelted him in the piazza. He\xe2\x80\x99s a coward, else he might have made a\r\nbetter stand when he\xe2\x80\x99d got his horsemen. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll swallow no Medici\r\nany more, whatever else the French king wants to make us swallow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I like not those French cannon they talk of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Goro, none the\r\nless fat for two years\xe2\x80\x99 additional grievances. \xe2\x80\x9cSan Giovanni defend us!\r\nIf Messer Domeneddio means so well by us as your Frate says he does,\r\nSer Cioni, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he have sent the French another way to\r\nNaples?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Goro,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dyer; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a question worth putting. Thou art\r\nnot such a pumpkin-head as I took thee for. Why, they might have gone\r\nto Naples by Bologna, eh, Ser Cioni? or if they\xe2\x80\x99d gone to Arezzo\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have minded their going to Arezzo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFools! It will be for the good and glory of Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d Ser Cioni\r\nbegan. But he was interrupted by the exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cLook there!\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nburst from several voices at once, while the faces were all turned to a\r\nparty who were advancing along the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Cerretani.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and one of the French noblemen who are in his\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ser Cioni, in some contempt at this interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\npretends to look well satisfied\xe2\x80\x94that deep Tornabuoni\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nMedicean in his heart: mind that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe advancing party was rather a brilliant one, for there was not only\r\nthe distinguished presence of Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and the splendid\r\ncostume of the Frenchman with his elaborately displayed white linen and\r\ngorgeous embroidery; there were two other Florentines of high birth in\r\nhandsome dresses donned for the coming procession, and on the left-hand\r\nof the Frenchman was a figure that was not to be eclipsed by any amount\r\nof intention or brocade\xe2\x80\x94a figure we have often seen before. He wore\r\nnothing but black, for he was in mourning; but the black was presently\r\nto be covered by a red mantle, for he too was to walk in procession as\r\nLatin Secretary to the Ten. Tito Melema had become conspicuously\r\nserviceable in the intercourse with the French guests, from his\r\nfamiliarity with Southern Italy, and his readiness in the French\r\ntongue, which he had spoken in his early youth; and he had paid more\r\nthan one visit to the French camp at Signa. The lustre of good fortune\r\nwas upon him; he was smiling, listening, and explaining, with his usual\r\ngraceful unpretentious ease, and only a very keen eye bent on studying\r\nhim could have marked a certain amount of change in him which was not\r\nto be accounted for by the lapse of eighteen months. It was that change\r\nwhich comes from the final departure of moral youthfulness\xe2\x80\x94from the\r\ndistinct self-conscious adoption of a part in life. The lines of the\r\nface were as soft as ever, the eyes as pellucid; but something was\r\ngone\xe2\x80\x94something as indefinable as the changes in the morning twilight.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman was gathering instructions concerning ceremonial before\r\nriding back to Signa, and now he was going to have a final survey of\r\nthe Piazza del Duomo, where the royal procession was to pause for\r\nreligious purposes. The distinguished party attracted the notice of all\r\neyes as it entered the piazza, but the gaze was not entirely cordial\r\nand admiring; there were remarks not altogether allusive and mysterious\r\nto the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s hoof-shaped shoes\xe2\x80\x94delicate flattery of royal\r\nsuperfluity in toes; and there was no care that certain snarlings at\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMediceans\xe2\x80\x9d should be strictly inaudible. But Lorenzo Tornabuoni\r\npossessed that power of dissembling annoyance which is demanded in a\r\nman who courts popularity, and Tito, besides his natural disposition to\r\novercome ill-will by good-humour, had the unimpassioned feeling of the\r\nalien towards names and details that move the deepest passions of the\r\nnative.\r\n\r\nArrived where they could get a good oblique view of the Duomo, the\r\nparty paused. The festoons and devices placed over the central doorway\r\nexcited some demur, and Tornabuoni beckoned to Piero di Cosimo, who, as\r\nwas usual with him at this hour, was lounging in front of Nello\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\nThere was soon an animated discussion, and it became highly amusing\r\nfrom the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment at Piero\xe2\x80\x99s odd pungency of statement,\r\nwhich Tito translated literally. Even snarling onlookers became\r\ncurious, and their faces began to wear the half-smiling,\r\nhalf-humiliated expression of people who are not within hearing of the\r\njoke which is producing infectious laughter. It was a delightful moment\r\nfor Tito, for he was the only one of the party who could have made so\r\namusing an interpreter, and without any disposition to triumphant\r\nself-gratulation he revelled in the sense that he was an object of\r\nliking\xe2\x80\x94he basked in approving glances. The rainbow light fell about the\r\nlaughing group, and the grave church-goers had all disappeared within\r\nthe walls. It seemed as if the piazza had been decorated for a real\r\nFlorentine holiday.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in the grey light of the unadorned streets there were\r\non-comers who made no show of linen and brocade, and whose humour was\r\nfar from merry. Here, too, the French dress and hoofed shoes were\r\nconspicuous, but they were being pressed upon by a larger and larger\r\nnumber of non-admiring Florentines. In the van of the crowd were three\r\nmen in scanty clothing; each had his hands bound together by a cord,\r\nand a rope was fastened round his neck and body, in such a way that he\r\nwho held the extremity of the rope might easily check any rebellious\r\nmovement by the threat of throttling. The men who held the ropes were\r\nFrench soldiers, and by broken Italian phrases and strokes from the\r\nknotted end of the rope, they from time to time stimulated their\r\nprisoners to beg. Two of them were obedient, and to every Florentine\r\nthey had encountered had held out their bound hands and said in piteous\r\ntones\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God and the Holy Madonna, give us something towards\r\nour ransom! We are Tuscans: we were made prisoners in Lunigiana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the third man remained obstinately silent under all the strokes\r\nfrom the knotted cord. He was very different in aspect from his two\r\nfellow-prisoners. They were young and hardy, and, in the scant clothing\r\nwhich the avarice of their captors had left them, looked like vulgar,\r\nsturdy mendicants. But he had passed the boundary of old age, and could\r\nhardly be less than four or five and sixty. His beard, which had grown\r\nlong in neglect, and the hair which fell thick and straight round his\r\nbaldness, were nearly white. His thickset figure was still firm and\r\nupright, though emaciated, and seemed to express energy in spite of\r\nage\xe2\x80\x94an expression that was partly carried out in the dark eyes and\r\nstrong dark eyebrows, which had a strangely isolated intensity of\r\ncolour in the midst of his yellow, bloodless, deep-wrinkled face with\r\nits lank grey hairs. And yet there was something fitful in the eyes\r\nwhich contradicted the occasional flash of energy: after looking round\r\nwith quick fierceness at windows and faces, they fell again with a lost\r\nand wandering look. But his lips were motionless, and he held his hands\r\nresolutely down. He would not beg.\r\n\r\nThis sight had been witnessed by the Florentines with growing\r\nexasperation. Many standing at their doors or passing quietly along had\r\nat once given money\xe2\x80\x94some in half-automatic response to an appeal in the\r\nname of God, others in that unquestioning awe of the French soldiery\r\nwhich had been created by the reports of their cruel warfare, and on\r\nwhich the French themselves counted as a guarantee of immunity in their\r\nacts of insolence. But as the group had proceeded farther into the\r\nheart of the city, that compliance had gradually disappeared, and the\r\nsoldiers found themselves escorted by a gathering troop of men and\r\nboys, who kept up a chorus of exclamations sufficiently intelligible to\r\nforeign ears without any interpreter. The soldiers themselves began to\r\ndislike their position, for, with a strong inclination to use their\r\nweapons, they were checked by the necessity for keeping a secure hold\r\non their prisoners, and they were now hurrying along in the hope of\r\nfinding shelter in a hostelry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrench dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBullock-feet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnatch their pikes from them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut the cords and make them run for their prisoners. They\xe2\x80\x99ll run as\r\nfast as geese\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see they\xe2\x80\x99re web-footed?\xe2\x80\x9d These were the cries\r\nwhich the soldiers vaguely understood to be jeers, and probably\r\nthreats. But every one seemed disposed to give invitations of this\r\nspirited kind rather than to act upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSantiddio! here\xe2\x80\x99s a sight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the dyer, as soon as he had divined\r\nthe meaning of the advancing tumult, \xe2\x80\x9cand the fools do nothing but\r\nhoot. Come along!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, snatching his axe from his belt, and\r\nrunning to join the crowd, followed by the butcher and all the rest of\r\nhis companions, except Goro, who hastily retreated up a narrow passage.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the dyer, running forward with blood-red arms and axe\r\nuplifted, and with his cluster of rough companions behind him, had a\r\nstimulating effect on the crowd. Not that he did anything else than\r\npass beyond the soldiers and thrust himself well among his\r\nfellow-citizens, flourishing his axe; but he served as a stirring\r\nsymbol of street-fighting, like the waving of a well-known gonfalon.\r\nAnd the first sign that fire was ready to burst out was something as\r\nrapid as a little leaping tongue of flame: it was an act of the\r\nconjuror\xe2\x80\x99s impish lad Lollo, who was dancing and jeering in front of\r\nthe ingenuous boys that made the majority of the crowd. Lollo had no\r\ngreat compassion for the prisoners, but being conscious of an excellent\r\nknife which was his unfailing companion, it had seemed to him from the\r\nfirst that to jump forward, cut a rope, and leap back again before the\r\nsoldier who held it could use his weapon, would be an amusing and\r\ndexterous piece of mischief. And now, when the people began to hoot and\r\njostle more vigorously, Lollo felt that his moment was come\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nclose to the eldest prisoner: in an instant he had cut the cord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun, old one!\xe2\x80\x9d he piped in the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s ear, as soon as the cord was\r\nin two; and himself set the example of running as if he were helped\r\nalong with wings, like a scared fowl.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sensations were not too slow for him to seize the\r\nopportunity: the idea of escape had been continually present with him,\r\nand he had gathered fresh hope from the temper of the crowd. He ran at\r\nonce; but his speed would hardly have sufficed for him if the\r\nFlorentines had not instantaneously rushed between him and his captor.\r\nHe ran on into the piazza, but he quickly heard the tramp of feet\r\nbehind him, for the other two prisoners had been released, and the\r\nsoldiers were struggling and fighting their way after them, in such\r\ntardigrade fashion as their hoof-shaped shoes would allow\xe2\x80\x94impeded, but\r\nnot very resolutely attacked, by the people. One of the two younger\r\nprisoners turned up the Borgo di San Lorenzo, and thus made a partial\r\ndiversion of the hubbub; but the main struggle was still towards the\r\npiazza, where all eyes were turned on it with alarmed curiosity. The\r\ncause could not be precisely guessed, for the French dress was screened\r\nby the impeding crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn escape of prisoners,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorenzo Tornabuoni, as he and his party\r\nturned round just against the steps of the Duomo, and saw a prisoner\r\nrushing by them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people are not content with having emptied the\r\nBargello the other day. If there is no other authority in sight they\r\nmust fall on the sbirri and secure freedom to thieves. Ah! there is a\r\nFrench soldier: that is more serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier he saw was struggling along on the north side of the\r\npiazza, but the object of his pursuit had taken the other direction.\r\nThat object was the eldest prisoner, who had wheeled round the\r\nBaptistery and was running towards the Duomo, determined to take refuge\r\nin that sanctuary rather than trust to his speed. But in mounting the\r\nsteps, his foot received a shock; he was precipitated towards the group\r\nof signori, whose backs were turned to him, and was only able to\r\nrecover his balance as he clutched one of them by the arm.\r\n\r\nIt was Tito Melema who felt that clutch. He turned his head, and saw\r\nthe face of his adoptive father, Baldassarre Calvo, close to his own.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other, silent as death: Baldassarre, with\r\ndark fierceness and a tightening grip of the soiled worn hands on the\r\nvelvet-clad arm; Tito, with cheeks and lips all bloodless, fascinated\r\nby terror. It seemed a long while to them\xe2\x80\x94it was but a moment.\r\n\r\nThe first sound Tito heard was the short laugh of Piero di Cosimo, who\r\nstood close by him and was the only person that could see his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha! I know what a ghost should be now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is another escaped prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorenzo Tornabuoni. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is\r\nhe, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Some madman, surely_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito.\r\n\r\nHe hardly knew how the words had come to his lips: there are moments\r\nwhen our passions speak and decide for us, and we seem to stand by and\r\nwonder. They carry in them an inspiration of crime, that in one instant\r\ndoes the work of long premeditation.\r\n\r\nThe two men had not taken their eyes off each other, and it seemed to\r\nTito, when he had spoken, that some magical poison had darted from\r\nBaldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and that he felt it rushing through his veins. But\r\nthe next instant the grasp on his arm had relaxed, and Baldassarre had\r\ndisappeared within the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nAfter-Thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are easily frightened, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, with another scornful\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMy portrait is not as good as the original. But the old fellow\r\n_had_ a tiger look: I must go into the Duomo and see him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not pleasant to be laid hold of by a madman, if madman he be,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Lorenzo Tornabuoni, in polite excuse of Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps he is\r\nonly a ruffian. We shall hear. I think we must see if we have authority\r\nenough to stop this disturbance between our people and your\r\ncountrymen,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nThey advanced toward the crowd with their swords drawn, all the quiet\r\nspectators making an escort for them. Tito went too: it was necessary\r\nthat he should know what others knew about Baldassarre, and the first\r\npalsy of terror was being succeeded by the rapid devices to which\r\nmortal danger will stimulate the timid.\r\n\r\nThe rabble of men and boys, more inclined to hoot at the soldier and\r\ntorment him than to receive or inflict any serious wounds, gave way at\r\nthe approach of signori with drawn swords, and the French soldier was\r\ninterrogated. He and his companions had simply brought their prisoners\r\ninto the city that they might beg money for their ransom: two of the\r\nprisoners were Tuscan soldiers taken in Lunigiana; the other, an\r\nelderly man, was with a party of Genoese, with whom the French foragers\r\nhad come to blows near Fivizzano. He might be mad, but he was harmless.\r\nThe soldier knew no more, being unable to understand a word the old man\r\nsaid. Tito heard so far, but he was deaf to everything else till he was\r\nspecially addressed. It was Tornabuoni who spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go back with us, Melema? Or, since Messere is going off to\r\nSigna now, will you wisely follow the fashion of the times and go to\r\nhear the Frate, who will be like the torrent at its height this\r\nmorning? It\xe2\x80\x99s what we must all do, you know, if we are to save our\r\nMedicean skins. _I_ should go if I had the leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s face had recovered its colour now, and he could make an effort\r\nto speak with gaiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am among the admirers of the inspired orator,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsmilingly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, unfortunately, I shall be occupied with the Segretario\r\ntill the time of the procession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ am going into the Duomo to look at that savage old man again,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Piero.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen have the charity to show him to one of the hospitals for\r\ntravellers, Piero mio,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tornabuoni. \xe2\x80\x9cThe monks may find out\r\nwhether he wants putting into a cage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party separated, and Tito took his way to the Palazzo Vecchio,\r\nwhere he was to find Bartolommeo Scala. It was not a long walk, but,\r\nfor Tito, it was stretched out like the minutes of our morning dreams:\r\nthe short spaces of street and piazza held memories, and previsions,\r\nand torturing fears, that might have made the history of months. He\r\nfelt as if a serpent had begun to coil round his limbs. Baldassarre\r\nliving, and in Florence, was a living revenge, which would no more rest\r\nthan a winding serpent would rest until it had crushed its prey. It was\r\nnot in the nature of that man to let an injury pass unavenged: his love\r\nand his hatred were of that passionate fervour which subjugates all the\r\nrest of the being, and makes a man sacrifice himself to his passion as\r\nif it were a deity to be worshipped with self-destruction. Baldassarre\r\nhad relaxed his hold, and had disappeared. Tito knew well how to\r\ninterpret that: it meant that the vengeance was to be studied that it\r\nmight be sure. If he had not uttered those decisive words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a\r\nmadman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94if he could have summoned up the state of mind, the courage,\r\nnecessary for avowing his recognition of Baldassarre, would not the\r\nrisk have been less? He might have declared himself to have had what he\r\nbelieved to be positive evidence of Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s death; and the only\r\npersons who could ever have had positive knowledge to contradict him,\r\nwere Fra Luca, who was dead, and the crew of the companion galley, who\r\nhad brought him the news of the encounter with the pirates. The chances\r\nwere infinite against Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s having met again with any one of\r\nthat crew, and Tito thought with bitterness that a timely, well-devised\r\nfalsehood might have saved him from any fatal consequences. But to have\r\ntold that falsehood would have required perfect self-command in the\r\nmoment of a convulsive shock: he seemed to have spoken without any\r\npreconception: the words had leaped forth like a sudden birth that had\r\nbeen begotten and nourished in the darkness.\r\n\r\nTito was experiencing that inexorable law of human souls, that we\r\nprepare ourselves for sudden deeds by the reiterated choice of good or\r\nevil which gradually determines character.\r\n\r\nThere was but one chance for him now; the chance of Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfailure in finding his revenge. And\xe2\x80\x94Tito grasped at a thought more\r\nactively cruel than any he had ever encouraged before: might not his\r\nown unpremeditated words have some truth in them? Enough truth, at\r\nleast, to bear him out in his denial of any declaration Baldassarre\r\nmight make about him? The old man looked strange and wild; with his\r\neager heart and brain, suffering was likely enough to have produced\r\nmadness. If it were so, the vengeance that strove to inflict disgrace\r\nmight be baffled.\r\n\r\nBut there was another form of vengeance not to be baffled by ingenious\r\nlying. Baldassarre belonged to a race to whom the thrust of the dagger\r\nseems almost as natural an impulse as the outleap of the tiger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalons. Tito shrank with shuddering dread from disgrace; but he had\r\nalso that physical dread which is inseparable from a soft\r\npleasure-loving nature, and which prevents a man from meeting wounds\r\nand death as a welcome relief from disgrace. His thoughts flew at once\r\nto some hidden defensive armour that might save him from a vengeance\r\nwhich no subtlety could parry.\r\n\r\nHe wondered at the power of the passionate fear that possessed him. It\r\nwas as if he had been smitten with a blighting disease that had\r\nsuddenly turned the joyous sense of young life into pain.\r\n\r\nThere was still one resource open to Tito. He might have turned back,\r\nsought Baldassarre again, confessed everything to him\xe2\x80\x94to Romola\xe2\x80\x94to all\r\nthe world. But he never thought of that. The repentance which cuts off\r\nall moorings to evil, demands something more than selfish fear. He had\r\nno sense that there was strength and safety in truth; the only strength\r\nhe trusted to lay in his ingenuity and his dissimulation. Now that the\r\nfirst shock, which had called up the traitorous signs of fear, was well\r\npast, he hoped to be prepared for all emergencies by cool deceit\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ndefensive armour.\r\n\r\nIt was a characteristic fact in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s experience at this crisis, that\r\nno direct measures for ridding himself of Baldassarre ever occurred to\r\nhim. All other possibilities passed through his mind, even to his own\r\nflight from Florence; but he never thought of any scheme for removing\r\nhis enemy. His dread generated no active malignity, and he would still\r\nhave been glad not to give pain to any mortal. He had simply chosen to\r\nmake life easy to himself\xe2\x80\x94to carry his human lot, if possible, in such\r\na way that it should pinch him nowhere; and the choice had, at various\r\ntimes, landed him in unexpected positions. The question now was, not\r\nwhether he should divide the common pressure of destiny with his\r\nsuffering fellow-men; it was whether all the resources of lying would\r\nsave him from being crushed by the consequences of that habitual\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nInside the Duomo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Baldassarre, with his hands bound together, and the rope round his\r\nneck and body, pushed his way behind the curtain, and saw the interior\r\nof the Duomo before him, he gave a start of astonishment, and stood\r\nstill against the doorway. He had expected to see a vast nave empty of\r\neverything but lifeless emblems\xe2\x80\x94side altars with candles unlit, dim\r\npictures, pale and rigid statues\xe2\x80\x94with perhaps a few worshippers in the\r\ndistant choir following a monotonous chant. That was the ordinary\r\naspect of churches to a man who never went into them with any religious\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAnd he saw, instead, a vast multitude of warm, living faces, upturned\r\nin breathless silence towards the pulpit, at the angle between the nave\r\nand the choir. The multitude was of all ranks, from magistrates and\r\ndames of gentle nurture to coarsely-clad artisans and country people.\r\nIn the pulpit was a Dominican friar, with strong features and dark\r\nhair, preaching with the crucifix in his hand.\r\n\r\nFor the first few minutes Baldassarre noted nothing of his preaching.\r\nSilent as his entrance had been, some eyes near the doorway had been\r\nturned on him with surprise and suspicion. The rope indicated plainly\r\nenough that he was an escaped prisoner, but in that case the church was\r\na sanctuary which he had a right to claim; his advanced years and look\r\nof wild misery were fitted to excite pity rather than alarm; and as he\r\nstood motionless, with eyes that soon wandered absently from the wide\r\nscene before him to the pavement at his feet, those who had observed\r\nhis entrance presently ceased to regard him, and became absorbed again\r\nin the stronger interest of listening to the sermon.\r\n\r\nAmong the eyes that had been turned towards him were Romola\xe2\x80\x99s: she had\r\nentered late through one of the side doors and was so placed that she\r\nhad a full view of the main entrance. She had looked long and\r\nattentively at Baldassarre, for grey hairs made a peculiar appeal to\r\nher, and the stamp of some unwonted suffering in the face, confirmed by\r\nthe cord round his neck, stirred in her those sensibilities towards the\r\nsorrows of age, which her whole life had tended to develop. She fancied\r\nthat his eyes had met hers in their first wandering gaze; but\r\nBaldassarre had not, in reality, noted her; he had only had a startled\r\nconsciousness of the general scene, and the consciousness was a mere\r\nflash that made no perceptible break in the fierce tumult of emotion\r\nwhich the encounter with Tito had created. Images from the past kept\r\nurging themselves upon him like delirious visions strangely blended\r\nwith thirst and anguish. No distinct thought for the future could shape\r\nitself in the midst of that fiery passion: the nearest approach to such\r\nthought was the bitter sense of enfeebled powers, and a vague\r\ndetermination to universal distrust and suspicion. Suddenly he felt\r\nhimself vibrating to loud tones, which seemed like the thundering echo\r\nof his own passion. A voice that penetrated his very marrow with its\r\naccent of triumphant certitude was saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe day of vengeance is at\r\nhand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldassarre quivered and looked up. He was too distant to see more than\r\nthe general aspect of the preacher standing, with his right arm\r\noutstretched, lifting up the crucifix; but he panted for the\r\nthreatening voice again as if it had been a promise of bliss. There was\r\na pause before the preacher spoke again. He gradually lowered his arm.\r\nHe deposited the crucifix on the edge of the pulpit, and crossed his\r\narms over his breast, looking round at the multitude as if he would\r\nmeet the glance of every individual face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ye in Florence are my witnesses, for I spoke not in a corner. Ye\r\nare my witnesses, that four years ago, when there were yet no signs of\r\nwar and tribulation, I preached the coming of the scourge. I lifted up\r\nmy voice as a trumpet to the prelates and princes and people of Italy\r\nand said, The cup of your iniquity is full. Behold, the thunder of the\r\nLord is gathering, and it shall fall and break the cup, and your\r\niniquity, which seems to you as pleasant wine, shall be poured out upon\r\nyou, and shall be as molten lead. And you, O priests, who say, Ha, ha!\r\nthere is no Presence in the sanctuary\xe2\x80\x94the Shechinah is nought\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nMercy-seat is bare: we may sin behind the veil, and who shall punish\r\nus? To you, I said, the presence of God shall be revealed in his temple\r\nas a consuming fire, and your sacred garments shall become a\r\nwinding-sheet of flame, and for sweet music there shall be shrieks and\r\nhissing, and for soft couches there shall be thorns, and for the breath\r\nof wantons shall come the pestilence. Trust not in your gold and\r\nsilver, trust not in your high fortresses; for, though the walls were\r\nof iron, and the fortresses of adamant, the Most High shall put terror\r\ninto your hearts and weakness into your councils, so that you shall be\r\nconfounded and flee like women. He shall break in pieces mighty men\r\nwithout number, and put others in their stead. For God will no longer\r\nendure the pollution of his sanctuary; he will thoroughly purge his\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd forasmuch as it is written that God will do nothing but he\r\nrevealeth it to his servants the prophets, he has chosen me, his\r\nunworthy servant, and made his purpose present to my soul in the living\r\nword of the Scriptures, and in the deeds of his providence; and by the\r\nministry of angels he has revealed it to me in visions. And his word\r\npossesses me so that I am but as the branch of the forest when the wind\r\nof heaven penetrates it, and it is not in me to keep silence, even\r\nthough I may be a derision to the scorner. And for four years I have\r\npreached in obedience to the Divine will: in the face of scoffing I\r\nhave preached three things, which the Lord has delivered to me: that\r\n_in these times God will regenerate his Church_, and that _before the\r\nregeneration must come the scourge over all Italy_, and that _these\r\nthings will come quickly_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hypocrites who cloak their hatred of the truth with a show of love\r\nhave said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Come now, Frate, leave your prophesyings: it is\r\nenough to teach virtue.\xe2\x80\x99 To these I answer: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, you say in your\r\nhearts, God lives afar off, and his word is as a parchment written by\r\ndead men, and he deals not as in the days of old, rebuking the nations,\r\nand punishing the oppressors, and smiting the unholy priests as he\r\nsmote the sons of Eli. But I cry again in your ears: God is near and\r\nnot afar off; his judgments change not. He is the God of armies; the\r\nstrong men who go up to battle are his ministers, even as the storm,\r\nand fire, and pestilence. He drives them by the breath of his angels,\r\nand they come upon the chosen land which has forsaken the covenant. And\r\nthou, O Italy, art the chosen land; has not God placed his sanctuary\r\nwithin thee, and thou hast polluted it? Behold, the ministers of his\r\nwrath are upon thee\xe2\x80\x94they are at thy very doors!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s voice had been rising in impassioned force up to this\r\npoint, when he became suddenly silent, let his hands fall and clasped\r\nthem quietly before him. His silence, instead of being the signal for\r\nsmall movements amongst his audience, seemed to be as strong a spell to\r\nthem as his voice. Through the vast area of the cathedral men and women\r\nsat with faces upturned, like breathing statues, till the voice was\r\nheard again in clear low tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet there is a pause\xe2\x80\x94even as in the days when Jerusalem was destroyed\r\nthere was a pause that the children of God might flee from it. There is\r\na stillness before the storm: lo, there is blackness above, but not a\r\nleaf quakes: the winds are stayed, that the voice of God\xe2\x80\x99s warning may\r\nbe heard. Hear it now, O Florence, chosen city in the chosen land!\r\nRepent and forsake evil: do justice: love mercy: put away all\r\nuncleanness from among you, that the spirit of truth and holiness may\r\nfill your souls and breathe through all your streets and habitations,\r\nand then the pestilence shall not enter, and the sword shall pass over\r\nyou and leave you unhurt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sword is hanging from the sky; it is quivering; it is about to\r\nfall! _The sword of God upon the earth, swift and sudden_! Did I not\r\ntell you, years ago, that I had beheld the vision and heard the voice?\r\nAnd behold, it is fulfilled! Is there not a king with his army at your\r\ngates? Does not the earth shake with the tread of horses and the wheels\r\nof swift cannon? Is there not a fierce multitude that can lay bare the\r\nland as with a sharp razor? I tell you the French king with his army is\r\nthe minister of God: God shall guide him as the hand guides a sharp\r\nsickle, and the joints of the wicked shall melt before him, and they\r\nshall be mown down as stubble: he that fleeth of them shall not flee\r\naway, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. And the\r\ntyrants who have made to themselves a throne out of the vices of the\r\nmultitude, and the unbelieving priests who traffic in the souls of men\r\nand fill the very sanctuary with fornication, shall be hurled from\r\ntheir soft couches into burning hell; and the pagans and they who\r\nsinned under the old covenant shall stand aloof and say: \xe2\x80\x98Lo, these men\r\nhave brought the stench of a new wickedness into the everlasting fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou, O Florence, take the offered mercy. See! the Cross is held\r\nout to you: come and be healed. Which among the nations of Italy has\r\nhad a token like unto yours? The tyrant is driven out from among you:\r\nthe men who held a bribe in their left-hand and a rod in the right are\r\ngone forth, and no blood has been spilled. And now put away every other\r\nabomination from among you, and you shall be strong in the strength of\r\nthe living God. Wash yourselves from the black pitch of your vices,\r\nwhich have made you even as the heathens: put away the envy and hatred\r\nthat have made your city as a nest of wolves. And there shall no harm\r\nhappen to you: and the passage of armies shall be to you as a flight of\r\nbirds, and rebellious Pisa shall be given to you again, and famine and\r\npestilence shall be far from your gates, and you shall be as a beacon\r\namong the nations. But, mark! while you suffer the accursed thing to\r\nlie in the camp you shall be afflicted and tormented, even though a\r\nremnant among you may be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese admonitions and promises had been spoken in an incisive tone of\r\nauthority; but in the next sentence the preacher\xe2\x80\x99s voice melted into a\r\nstrain of entreaty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, O people, over whom my heart yearns, as the heart of a mother\r\nover the children she has travailed for! God is my witness that but for\r\nyour sakes I would willingly live as a turtle in the depths of the\r\nforest, singing low to my Beloved, who is mine and I am his. For you I\r\ntoil, for you I languish, for you my nights are spent in watching, and\r\nmy soul melteth away for very heaviness. O Lord, thou knowest I am\r\nwilling\xe2\x80\x94I am ready. Take me, stretch me on thy cross: let the wicked\r\nwho delight in blood, and rob the poor, and defile the temple of their\r\nbodies, and harden themselves against thy mercy\xe2\x80\x94let them wag their\r\nheads and shoot out the lip at me: let the thorns press upon my brow,\r\nand let my sweat be anguish\xe2\x80\x94I desire to be made like thee in thy great\r\nlove. But let me see the fruit of my travail\xe2\x80\x94let this people be saved!\r\nLet me see them clothed in purity: let me hear their voices rise in\r\nconcord as the voices of the angels: let them see no wisdom but in thy\r\neternal law, no beauty but in holiness. Then they shall lead the way\r\nbefore the nations, and the people from the four winds shall follow\r\nthem, and be gathered into the fold of the blessed. For it is thy will,\r\nO God, that the earth shall be converted unto thy law: it is thy will\r\nthat wickedness shall cease and love shall reign. Come, O blessed\r\npromise; and behold, I am willing\xe2\x80\x94lay me on the altar: let my blood\r\nflow and the fire consume me; but let my witness be remembered among\r\nmen, that iniquity shall not prosper for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the last appeal, Savonarola had stretched out his arms and\r\nlifted up his eyes to heaven; his strong voice had alternately trembled\r\nwith emotion and risen again in renewed energy; but the passion with\r\nwhich he offered himself as a victim became at last too strong to allow\r\nof further speech, and he ended in a sob. Every changing tone,\r\nvibrating through the audience, shook them into answering emotion.\r\nThere were plenty among them who had very moderate faith in the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprophetic mission, and who in their cooler moments loved him little;\r\nnevertheless, they too were carried along by the great wave of feeling\r\nwhich gathered its force from sympathies that lay deeper than all\r\ntheory. A loud responding sob rose at once from the wide multitude,\r\nwhile Savonarola had fallen on his knees and buried his face in his\r\nmantle. He felt in that moment the rapture and glory of martyrdom\r\nwithout its agony.\r\n\r\nIn that great sob of the multitude Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s had mingled. Among all\r\nthe human beings present, there was perhaps not one whose frame\r\nvibrated more strongly than his to the tones and words of the preacher;\r\nbut it had vibrated like a harp of which all the strings had been\r\nwrenched away except one. That threat of a fiery inexorable\r\nvengeance\xe2\x80\x94of a future into which the hated sinner might be pursued and\r\nheld by the avenger in an eternal grapple, had come to him like the\r\npromise of an unquenchable fountain to unquenchable thirst. The\r\ndoctrines of the sages, the old contempt for priestly superstitions,\r\nhad fallen away from his soul like a forgotten language: if he could\r\nhave remembered them, what answer could they have given to his great\r\nneed like the answer given by this voice of energetic conviction? The\r\nthunder of denunciation fell on his passion-wrought nerves with all the\r\nforce of self-evidence: his thought never went beyond it into\r\nquestions\xe2\x80\x94he was possessed by it as the war-horse is possessed by the\r\nclash of sounds. No word that was not a threat touched his\r\nconsciousness; he had no fibre to be thrilled by it. But the fierce\r\nexultant delight to which he was moved by the idea of perpetual\r\nvengeance found at once a climax and a relieving outburst in the\r\npreacher\xe2\x80\x99s words of self-sacrifice. To Baldassarre those words only\r\nbrought the vague triumphant sense that he too was devoting\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94signing with his own blood the deed by which he gave himself\r\nover to an unending fire, that would seem but coolness to his burning\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rescued him\xe2\x80\x94I cherished him\xe2\x80\x94if I might clutch his heart-strings for\r\never! Come, O blessed promise! Let my blood flow; let the fire consume\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe one cord vibrated to its utmost. Baldassarre clutched his own\r\npalms, driving his long nails into them, and burst into a sob with the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nOutside the Duomo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Baldassarre was possessed by the voice of Savonarola, he had not\r\nnoticed that another man had entered through the doorway behind him,\r\nand stood not far off observing him. It was Piero di Cosimo, who took\r\nno heed of the preaching, having come solely to look at the escaped\r\nprisoner. During the pause, in which the preacher and his audience had\r\ngiven themselves up to inarticulate emotion, the new-comer advanced and\r\ntouched Baldassarre on the arm. He looked round with the tears still\r\nslowly rolling down his face, but with a vigorous sigh, as if he had\r\ndone with that outburst. The painter spoke to him in a low tone\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I cut your cords for you? I have heard how you were made\r\nprisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldassarre did not reply immediately; he glanced suspiciously at the\r\nofficious stranger. At last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter come outside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero.\r\n\r\nBaldassarre again looked at him suspiciously; and Piero, partly\r\nguessing his thought, smiled, took out a knife, and cut the cords. He\r\nbegan to think that the idea of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s madness was not\r\nimprobable, there was something so peculiar in the expression of his\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cif he does any mischief, he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get tied\r\nup again. The poor devil shall have a chance, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are afraid of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said again, in an undertone; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto tell me anything about yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldassarre was folding his arms in enjoyment of the long-absent\r\nmuscular sensation. He answered Piero with a less suspicious look and a\r\ntone which had some quiet decision in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have nothing to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, \xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps you want shelter, and may not\r\nknow how hospitable we Florentines are to visitors with torn doublets\r\nand empty stomachs. There\xe2\x80\x99s an hospital for poor travellers outside all\r\nour gates, and, if you liked, I could put you in the way to one.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no danger from your French soldier. He has been sent off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldassarre nodded, and turned in silent acceptance of the offer, and\r\nhe and Piero left the church together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to sit to me for your portrait, should you?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPiero, as they went along the Via dell\xe2\x80\x99 Oriuolo, on the way to the gate\r\nof Santa Croce. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a painter: I would give you money to get your\r\nportrait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suspicion returned into Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s glance, as he looked at\r\nPiero, and said decidedly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the painter, curtly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, go straight on, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nthe Porta Santa Croce, and outside it there\xe2\x80\x99s an hospital for\r\ntravellers. So you\xe2\x80\x99ll not accept any service from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you thanks for what you have done already. I need no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, with a shrug, and they turned away from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mysterious old tiger!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the artist, \xe2\x80\x9cwell worth painting.\r\nUgly\xe2\x80\x94with deep lines\xe2\x80\x94looking as if the plough and the harrow had gone\r\nover his heart. A fine contrast to my bland and smiling Messer Greco\xe2\x80\x94my\r\n_Bacco trionfante_, who has married the fair Antigone in contradiction\r\nto all history and fitness. Aha! his scholar\xe2\x80\x99s blood curdled\r\nuncomfortably at the old fellow\xe2\x80\x99s clutch!\xe2\x80\x9d When Piero re-entered the\r\nPiazza del Duomo the multitude who had been listening to Fra Girolamo\r\nwere pouring out from all the doors, and the haste they made to go on\r\ntheir several ways was a proof how important they held the preaching\r\nwhich had detained them from the other occupations of the day. The\r\nartist leaned against an angle of the Baptistery and watched the\r\ndeparting crowd, delighting in the variety of the garb and of the keen\r\ncharacteristic faces\xe2\x80\x94faces such as Masaccio had painted more than fifty\r\nyears before: such as Domenico Ghirlandajo had not yet quite left off\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nThis morning was a peculiar occasion, and the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s audience, always\r\nmultifarious, had represented even more completely than usual the\r\nvarious classes and political parties of Florence. There were men of\r\nhigh birth, accustomed to public charges at home and abroad, who had\r\nbecome newly conspicuous not only as enemies of the Medici and friends\r\nof popular government, but as thorough Piagnoni, espousing to the\r\nutmost the doctrines and practical teaching of the Frate, and\r\nfrequenting San Marco as the seat of another Samuel: some of them men\r\nof authoritative and handsome presence, like Francesco Valori, and\r\nperhaps also of a hot and arrogant temper, very much gratified by an\r\nimmediate divine authority for bringing about freedom in their own way;\r\nothers, like Soderini, with less of the ardent Piagnone, and more of\r\nthe wise politician. There were men, also of family, like Piero\r\nCapponi, simply brave undoctrinal lovers of a sober republican liberty,\r\nwho preferred fighting to arguing, and had no particular reasons for\r\nthinking any ideas false that kept out the Medici and made room for\r\npublic spirit. At their elbows were doctors of law whose studies of\r\nAccursius and his brethren had not so entirely consumed their ardour as\r\nto prevent them from becoming enthusiastic Piagnoni: Messer Luca\r\nCorsini himself, for example, who on a memorable occasion yet to come\r\nwas to raise his learned arms in street stone-throwing for the cause of\r\nreligion, freedom, and the Frate. And among the dignities who carried\r\ntheir black lucco or furred mantle with an air of habitual authority,\r\nthere was an abundant sprinkling of men with more contemplative and\r\nsensitive faces: scholars inheriting such high names as Strozzi and\r\nAcciajoli, who were already minded to take the cowl and join the\r\ncommunity of San Marco; artists, wrought to a new and higher ambition\r\nby the teaching of Savonarola, like that young painter who had lately\r\nsurpassed himself in his fresco of the divine child on the wall of the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s bare cell\xe2\x80\x94unconscious yet that he would one day himself wear\r\nthe tonsure and the cowl, and be called Fra Bartolommeo. There was the\r\nmystic poet Girolamo Benevieni hastening, perhaps, to carry tidings of\r\nthe beloved Frate\xe2\x80\x99s speedy coming to his friend Pico della Mirandola,\r\nwho was never to see the light of another morning. There were well-born\r\nwomen attired with such scrupulous plainness that their more refined\r\ngrace was the chief distinction between them and their less\r\naristocratic sisters. There was a predominant proportion of the genuine\r\n_popolani_ or middle class, belonging both to the Major and Minor Arts,\r\nconscious of purses threatened by war-taxes. And more striking and\r\nvarious, perhaps, than all the other classes of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s disciples,\r\nthere was the long stream of poorer tradesmen and artisans, whose faith\r\nand hope in his Divine message varied from the rude and\r\nundiscriminating trust in him as the friend of the poor and the enemy\r\nof the luxurious oppressive rich, to that eager tasting of all the\r\nsubtleties of biblical interpretation which takes a peculiarly strong\r\nhold on the sedentary artisan, illuminating the long dim spaces beyond\r\nthe board where he stitches, with a pale flame that seems to him the\r\nlight of Divine science.\r\n\r\nBut among these various disciples of the Frate were scattered many who\r\nwere not in the least his disciples. Some were Mediceans who had\r\nalready, from motives of fear and policy, begun to show the presiding\r\nspirit of the popular party a feigned deference. Others were sincere\r\nadvocates of a free government, but regarded Savonarola simply as an\r\nambitious monk\xe2\x80\x94half sagacious, half fanatical\xe2\x80\x94who had made himself a\r\npowerful instrument with the people, and must be accepted as an\r\nimportant social fact. There were even some of his bitter enemies:\r\nmembers of the old aristocratic anti-Medicean party\xe2\x80\x94determined to try\r\nand get the reins once more tight in the hands of certain chief\r\nfamilies; or else licentious young men, who detested him as the killjoy\r\nof Florence. For the sermons in the Duomo had already become political\r\nincidents, attracting the ears of curiosity and malice, as well as of\r\nfaith. The men of ideas, like young Niccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli, went to\r\nobserve and write reports to friends away in country villas; the men of\r\nappetites, like Dolfo Spini, bent on hunting down the Frate, as a\r\npublic nuisance who made game scarce, went to feed their hatred and lie\r\nin wait for grounds of accusation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, while no preacher ever had a more massive influence than\r\nSavonarola, no preacher ever had more heterogeneous materials to work\r\nupon. And one secret of the massive influence lay in the highly mixed\r\ncharacter of his preaching. Baldassarre, wrought into an ecstasy of\r\nself-martyring revenge, was only an extreme case among the partial and\r\nnarrow sympathies of that audience. In Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s preaching there\r\nwere strains that appealed to the very finest susceptibilities of men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnatures, and there were elements that gratified low egoism, tickled\r\ngossiping curiosity, and fascinated timorous superstition. His need of\r\npersonal predominance, his labyrinthine allegorical interpretations of\r\nthe Scriptures, his enigmatic visions, and his false certitude about\r\nthe Divine intentions, never ceased, in his own large soul, to be\r\nennobled by that fervid piety, that passionate sense of the infinite,\r\nthat active sympathy, that clear-sighted demand for the subjection of\r\nselfish interests to the general good, which he had in common with the\r\ngreatest of mankind. But for the mass of his audience all the pregnancy\r\nof his preaching lay in his strong assertion of supernatural claims, in\r\nhis denunciatory visions, in the false certitude which gave his sermons\r\nthe interest of a political bulletin; and having once held that\r\naudience in his mastery, it was necessary to his nature\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nnecessary for their welfare\xe2\x80\x94that he should _keep_ the mastery. The\r\neffect was inevitable. No man ever struggled to retain power over a\r\nmixed multitude without suffering vitiation; his standard must be their\r\nlower needs and not his own best insight.\r\n\r\nThe mysteries of human character have seldom been presented in a way\r\nmore fitted to check the judgments of facile knowingness than in\r\nGirolamo Savonarola; but we can give him a reverence that needs no\r\nshutting of the eyes to fact, if we regard his life as a drama in which\r\nthere were great inward modifications accompanying the outward changes.\r\nAnd up to this period, when his more direct action on political affairs\r\nhad only just begun, it is probable that his imperious need of\r\nascendancy had burned undiscernibly in the strong flame of his zeal for\r\nGod and man.\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion of old, when an ox was led out for sacrifice to\r\nJupiter, to chalk the dark spots, and give the offering a false show of\r\nunblemished whiteness. Let us fling away the chalk, and boldly say,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nvictim is spotted, but it is not therefore in vain that his mighty\r\nheart is laid on the altar of men\xe2\x80\x99s highest hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nThe Garment of Fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening most people in Florence were glad the\r\nentrance of the new Charlemagne was fairly over. Doubtless when the\r\nroll of drums, the blast of trumpets, and the tramp of horses along the\r\nPisan road began to mingle with the pealing of the excited bells, it\r\nwas a grand moment for those who were stationed on turreted roofs, and\r\ncould see the long-winding terrible pomp on the background of the green\r\nhills and valley. There was no sunshine to light up the splendour of\r\nbanners, and spears, and plumes, and silken surcoats, but there was no\r\nthick cloud of dust to hide it, and as the picked troops advanced into\r\nclose view, they could be seen all the more distinctly for the absence\r\nof dancing glitter. Tall and tough Scotch archers, Swiss halberdiers\r\nfierce and ponderous, nimble Gascons ready to wheel and climb, cavalry\r\nin which each man looked like a knight-errant with his indomitable\r\nspear and charger\xe2\x80\x94it was satisfactory to be assured that they would\r\ninjure nobody but the enemies of God! With that confidence at heart it\r\nwas a less dubious pleasure to look at the array of strength and\r\nsplendour in nobles and knights, and youthful pages of choice\r\nlineage\xe2\x80\x94at the bossed and jewelled sword-hilts, at the satin scarfs\r\nembroidered with strange symbolical devices of pious or gallant\r\nmeaning, at the gold chains and jewelled aigrettes, at the gorgeous\r\nhorse-trappings and brocaded mantles, and at the transcendent canopy\r\ncarried by select youths above the head of the Most Christian King. To\r\nsum up with an old diarist, whose spelling and diction halted a little\r\nbehind the wonders of this royal visit,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_f\xc3\xb9 gran magnificenza_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut for the Signoria, who had been waiting on their platform against\r\nthe gates, and had to march out at the right moment, with their orator\r\nin front of them, to meet the mighty guest, the grandeur of the scene\r\nhad been somewhat screened by unpleasant sensations. If Messer Luca\r\nCorsini could have had a brief Latin welcome depending from his mouth\r\nin legible characters, it would have been less confusing when the rain\r\ncame on, and created an impatience in men and horses that broke off the\r\ndelivery of his well-studied periods, and reduced the representatives\r\nof the scholarly city to offer a makeshift welcome in impromptu French.\r\nBut that sudden confusion had created a great opportunity for Tito. As\r\none of the secretaries he was among the officials who were stationed\r\nbehind the Signoria, and with whom these highest dignities were\r\npromiscuously thrown when pressed upon by the horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody step forward and say a few words in French,\xe2\x80\x9d said Soderini.\r\nBut no one of high importance chose to risk a second failure. \xe2\x80\x9cYou,\r\nFrancesco Gaddi\xe2\x80\x94you can speak.\xe2\x80\x9d But Gaddi, distrusting his own\r\npromptness, hung back, and pushing Tito, said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Melema.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito stepped forward in an instant, and, with the air of profound\r\ndeference that came as naturally to him as walking, said the few\r\nneedful words in the name of the Signoria; then gave way gracefully,\r\nand let the king pass on. His presence of mind, which had failed him in\r\nthe terrible crisis of the morning, had been a ready instrument this\r\ntime. It was an excellent livery servant that never forsook him when\r\ndanger was not visible. But when he was complimented on his opportune\r\nservice, he laughed it off as a thing of no moment, and to those who\r\nhad not witnessed it, let Gaddi have the credit of the improvised\r\nwelcome. No wonder Tito was popular: the touchstone by which men try us\r\nis most often their own vanity.\r\n\r\nOther things besides the oratorical welcome had turned out rather worse\r\nthan had been expected. If everything had happened according to\r\ningenious preconceptions, the Florentine procession of clergy and laity\r\nwould not have found their way choked up and been obliged to take a\r\nmakeshift course through the back streets, so as to meet the king at\r\nthe Cathedral only. Also, if the young monarch under the canopy, seated\r\non his charger with his lance upon his thigh, had looked more like a\r\nCharlemagne and less like a hastily modelled grotesque, the imagination\r\nof his admirers would have been much assisted. It might have been\r\nwished that the scourge of Italian wickedness and \xe2\x80\x9cChampion of the\r\nhonour of women\xe2\x80\x9d had had a less miserable leg, and only the normal sum\r\nof toes; that his mouth had been of a less reptilian width of slit, his\r\nnose and head of a less exorbitant outline. But the thin leg rested on\r\ncloth of gold and pearls, and the face was only an interruption of a\r\nfew square inches in the midst of black velvet and gold, and the blaze\r\nof rubies, and the brilliant tints of the embroidered and bepearled\r\ncanopy,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_f\xc3\xb9 gran magnificenza_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the people had cried _Francia, Francia_! with an enthusiasm\r\nproportioned to the splendour of the canopy which they had torn to\r\npieces as their spoil, according to immemorial custom; royal lips had\r\nduly kissed the altar; and after all mischances the royal person and\r\nretinue were lodged in the Palace of the Via Larga, the rest of the\r\nnobles and gentry were dispersed among the great houses of Florence,\r\nand the terrible soldiery were encamped in the Prato and other open\r\nquarters. The business of the day was ended.\r\n\r\nBut the streets still presented a surprising aspect, such as\r\nFlorentines had not seen before under the November stars. Instead of a\r\ngloom unbroken except by a lamp burning feebly here and there before a\r\nsaintly image at the street-corners, or by a stream of redder light\r\nfrom an open doorway, there were lamps suspended at the windows of all\r\nhouses, so that men could walk along no less securely and commodiously\r\nthan by day,\xe2\x80\x94_f\xc3\xb9 gran magnificenza_.\r\n\r\nAlong those illuminated streets Tito Melema was walking at about eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, on his way homeward. He had been exerting\r\nhimself throughout the day under the pressure of hidden anxieties, and\r\nhad at last made his escape unnoticed from the midst of after-supper\r\ngaiety. Once at leisure thoroughly to face and consider his\r\ncircumstances, he hoped that he could so adjust himself to them and to\r\nall probabilities as to get rid of his childish fear. If he had only\r\nnot been wanting in the presence of mind necessary to recognise\r\nBaldassarre under that surprise!\xe2\x80\x94it would have been happier for him on\r\nall accounts; for he still winced under the sense that he was\r\ndeliberately inflicting suffering on his father: he would very much\r\nhave preferred that Baldassarre should be prosperous and happy. But he\r\nhad left himself no second path now: there could be no conflict any\r\nlonger: the only thing he had to do was to take care of himself.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts were in his mind he was advancing from the Piazza\r\ndi Santa Croce along the Via dei Benci, and as he neared the angle\r\nturning into the Borgo Santa Croce his ear was struck by a music which\r\nwas not that of evening revelry, but of vigorous labour\xe2\x80\x94the music of\r\nthe anvil. Tito gave a slight start and quickened his pace, for the\r\nsounds had suggested a welcome thought. He knew that they came from the\r\nworkshop of Niccol\xc3\xb2 Caparra, famous resort of all Florentines who cared\r\nfor curious and beautiful iron-work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes the giant at work so late?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cBut so much the\r\nbetter for me. I can do that little bit of business to-night instead of\r\nto-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPreoccupied as he was, he could not help pausing a moment in admiration\r\nas he came in front of the workshop. The wide doorway, standing at the\r\ntruncated angle of a great block or \xe2\x80\x9cisle\xe2\x80\x9d of houses, was surmounted by\r\na loggia roofed with fluted tiles, and supported by stone columns with\r\nroughly carved capitals. Against the red light framed in by the outline\r\nof the fluted tiles and columns stood in black relief the grand figure\r\nof Niccol\xc3\xb2, with his huge arms in rhythmic rise and fall, first hiding\r\nand then disclosing the profile of his firm mouth and powerful brow.\r\nTwo slighter ebony figures, one at the anvil, the other at the bellows,\r\nserved to set off his superior massiveness.\r\n\r\nTito darkened the doorway with a very different outline, standing in\r\nsilence, since it was useless to speak until Niccol\xc3\xb2 should deign to\r\npause and notice him. That was not until the smith had beaten the head\r\nof an axe to the due sharpness of edge and dismissed it from his anvil.\r\nBut in the meantime Tito had satisfied himself by a glance round the\r\nshop that the object of which he was in search had not disappeared.\r\n\r\nNiccol\xc3\xb2 gave an unceremonious but good-humoured nod as he turned from\r\nthe anvil and rested his hammer on his hip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Messer Tito? Business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly, Niccol\xc3\xb2; else I should not have ventured to interrupt you\r\nwhen you are working out of hours, since I take that as a sign that\r\nyour work is pressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the same work all day\xe2\x80\x94making axes and spear-heads. And\r\nevery fool that has passed my shop has put his pumpkin-head in to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Niccol\xc3\xb2, wilt thou not come and see the King of France and his\r\nsoldiers?\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered, \xe2\x80\x98No: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see their faces\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwant to see their backs.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you making arms for the citizens, then, Niccol\xc3\xb2, that they may\r\nhave something better than rusty scythes and spits in case of an\r\nuproar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see. Arms are good, and Florence is likely to want them. The\r\nFrate tells us we shall get Pisa again, and I hold with the Frate; but\r\nI should be glad to know how the promise is to be fulfilled, if we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get plenty of good weapons forged? The Frate sees a long way\r\nbefore him; that I believe. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see birds caught with\r\nwinking at them, as some of our people try to make out. He sees sense,\r\nand not nonsense. But you\xe2\x80\x99re a bit of a Medicean, Messer Tito Melema.\r\nEbbene! so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been myself in my time, before the cask began to run\r\nsour. What\xe2\x80\x99s your business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply to know the price of that fine coat of mail I saw hanging up\r\nhere the other day. I want to buy it for a certain personage who needs\r\na protection of that sort under his doublet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him come and buy it himself, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2, bluntly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrather nice about what I sell, and whom I sell to. I like to know who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy customer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your scruples, Niccol\xc3\xb2. But that is only defensive armour: it\r\ncan hurt nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue: but it may make the man who wears it feel himself all the safer\r\nif he should want to hurt somebody. No, no; it\xe2\x80\x99s not my own work; but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s fine work of Maso of Brescia; I should be loth for it to cover the\r\nheart of a scoundrel. I must know who is to wear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, to be plain with you, Niccol\xc3\xb2 mio, I want it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, knowing it was useless to try persuasion. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I am\r\nlikely to have a journey to take\xe2\x80\x94and you know what journeying is in\r\nthese times. You don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect _me_ of treason against the Republic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I know no harm of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2, in his blunt way again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nhave you the money to pay for the coat? For you\xe2\x80\x99ve passed my shop often\r\nenough to know my sign: you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the burning account-books. I trust\r\nnobody. The price is twenty florins, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsecond-hand. You\xe2\x80\x99re not likely to have so much money with you. Let it\r\nbe till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI happen to have the money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, who had been winning at play\r\nthe day before, and had not emptied his purse. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll carry the armour\r\nhome with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNiccol\xc3\xb2 reached down the finely-wrought coat, which fell together into\r\nlittle more than two handfuls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when the florins had been told down on his\r\npalm. \xe2\x80\x9cTake the coat. It\xe2\x80\x99s made to cheat sword, or poniard, or arrow.\r\nBut, for my part, I would never put such a thing on. It\xe2\x80\x99s like carrying\r\nfear about with one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNiccol\xc3\xb2\xe2\x80\x99s words had an unpleasant intensity of meaning for Tito. But he\r\nsmiled and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Niccol\xc3\xb2, we scholars are all cowards. Handling the pen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthicken the arm as your hammer-wielding does. Addio!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe folded the armour under his mantle, and hastened across the Ponte\r\nRubaconte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nThe Young Wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Tito was hastening across the bridge with the new-bought armour\r\nunder his mantle, Romola was pacing up and down the old library,\r\nthinking of him and longing for his return.\r\n\r\nIt was but a few fair faces that had not looked forth from windows that\r\nday to see the entrance of the French king and his nobles. One of the\r\nfew was Romola\xe2\x80\x99s. She had been present at no festivities since her\r\nfather had died\xe2\x80\x94died quite suddenly in his chair, three months before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not Tito coming to write?\xe2\x80\x9d he had said, when the bell had long ago\r\nsounded the usual hour in the evening. He had not asked before, from\r\ndread of a negative; but Romola had seen by his listening face and\r\nrestless movements that nothing else was in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father, he had to go to a supper at the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s: you know he is\r\nwanted so much by every one,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, in a tone of gentle excuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! then perhaps he will bring some positive word about the library;\r\nthe cardinal promised last week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardo, apparently pacified by\r\nthis hope.\r\n\r\nHe was silent a little while; then, suddenly flushing, he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go on without him, Romola. Get the pen. He has brought me no\r\nnew text to comment on; but I must say what I want to say about the New\r\nPlatonists. I shall die and nothing will have been done. Make haste, my\r\nRomola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, the next minute, holding the pen in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nBut there was silence. Romola took no note of this for a little while,\r\naccustomed to pauses in dictation; and when at last she looked round\r\ninquiringly, there was no change of attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite ready, father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Bardo was silent, and his silence was never again broken.\r\n\r\nRomola looked back on that hour with some indignation against herself,\r\nbecause even with the first outburst of her sorrow there had mingled\r\nthe irrepressible thought, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps my life with Tito will be more\r\nperfect now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the dream of a triple life with an undivided sum of happiness had\r\nnot been quite fulfilled. The rainbow-tinted shower of sweets, to have\r\nbeen perfectly typical, should have had some invisible seeds of\r\nbitterness mingled with them; the crowned Ariadne, under the snowing\r\nroses, had felt more and more the presence of unexpected thorns. It was\r\nnot Tito\xe2\x80\x99s fault, Romola had continually assured herself. He was still\r\nall gentleness to her, and to her father also. But it was in the nature\r\nof things\xe2\x80\x94she saw it clearly now\xe2\x80\x94it was in the nature of things that no\r\none but herself could go on month after month, and year after year,\r\nfulfilling patiently all her father\xe2\x80\x99s monotonous exacting demands. Even\r\nshe, whose sympathy with her father had made all the passion and\r\nreligion of her young years, had not always been patient, had been\r\ninwardly very rebellious. It was true that before their marriage, and\r\neven for some time after, Tito had seemed more unwearying than herself;\r\nbut then, of course, the effort had the ease of novelty. We assume a\r\nload with confident readiness, and up to a certain point the growing\r\nirksomeness of pressure is tolerable; but at last the desire for relief\r\ncan no longer be resisted. Romola said to herself that she had been\r\nvery foolish and ignorant in her girlish time: she was wiser now, and\r\nwould make no unfair demands on the man to whom she had given her best\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s love and worship. The breath of sadness that still cleaved to\r\nher lot while she saw her father month after month sink from elation\r\ninto new disappointment as Tito gave him less and less of his time, and\r\nmade bland excuses for not continuing his own share of the joint\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94that sadness was no fault of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s, she said, but rather of their\r\ninevitable destiny. If he stayed less and less with her, why, that was\r\nbecause they could hardly ever be alone. His caresses were no less\r\ntender: if she pleaded timidly on any one evening that he should stay\r\nwith her father instead of going to another engagement which was not\r\nperemptory, he excused himself with such charming gaiety, he seemed to\r\nlinger about her with such fond playfulness before he could quit her,\r\nthat she could only feel a little heartache in the midst of her love,\r\nand then go to her father and try to soften his vexation and\r\ndisappointment. But all the while inwardly her imagination was busy\r\ntrying to see how Tito could be as good as she had thought he was, and\r\nyet find it impossible to sacrifice those pleasures of society which\r\nwere necessarily more vivid to a bright creature like him than to the\r\ncommon run of men. She herself would have liked more gaiety, more\r\nadmiration: it was true, she gave it up willingly for her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake\xe2\x80\x94she would have given up much more than that for the sake even of a\r\nslight wish on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s part. It was clear that their natures differed\r\nwidely; but perhaps it was no more than the inherent difference between\r\nman and woman, that made her affections more absorbing. If there were\r\nany other difference she tried to persuade herself that the inferiority\r\nwas on her side. Tito was really kinder than she was, better tempered,\r\nless proud and resentful; he had no angry retorts, he met all\r\ncomplaints with perfect sweetness; he only escaped as quietly as he\r\ncould from things that were unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to every large nature, when it is not under the immediate\r\npower of some strong unquestioning emotion, to suspect itself, and\r\ndoubt the truth of its own impressions, conscious of possibilities\r\nbeyond its own horizon. And Romola was urged to doubt herself the more\r\nby the necessity of interpreting her disappointment in her life with\r\nTito so as to satisfy at once her love and her pride. Disappointment?\r\nYes, there was no other milder word that would tell the truth. Perhaps\r\nall women had to suffer the disappointment of ignorant hopes, if she\r\nonly knew their experience. Still, there had been something peculiar in\r\nher lot: her relation to her father had claimed unusual sacrifices from\r\nher husband. Tito had once thought that his love would make those\r\nsacrifices easy; his love had not been great enough for that. She was\r\nnot justified in resenting a self-delusion. No! resentment must not\r\nrise: all endurance seemed easy to Romola rather than a state of mind\r\nin which she would admit to herself that Tito acted unworthily. If she\r\nhad felt a new heartache in the solitary hours with her father through\r\nthe last months of his life, it had been by no inexcusable fault of her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s; and now\xe2\x80\x94it was a hope that would make its presence felt even\r\nin the first moments when her father\xe2\x80\x99s place was empty\xe2\x80\x94there was no\r\nlonger any importunate claim to divide her from Tito; their young lives\r\nwould flow in one current, and their true marriage would begin.\r\n\r\nBut the sense of something like guilt towards her father in a hope that\r\ngrew out of his death, gave all the more force to the anxiety with\r\nwhich she dwelt on the means of fulfilling his supreme wish. That piety\r\ntowards his memory was all the atonement she could make now for a\r\nthought that seemed akin to joy at his loss. The laborious simple life,\r\npure from vulgar corrupting ambitions, embittered by the frustration of\r\nthe dearest hopes, imprisoned at last in total darkness\xe2\x80\x94a long\r\nseed-time without a harvest\xe2\x80\x94was at an end now, and all that remained of\r\nit besides the tablet in Sante Croce and the unfinished commentary on\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s text, was the collection of manuscripts and antiquities, the\r\nfruit of half a century\xe2\x80\x99s toil and frugality. The fulfilment of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong ambition about this library was a sacramental\r\nobligation for Romola.\r\n\r\nThe precious relic was safe from creditors, for when the deficit\r\ntowards their payment had been ascertained, Bernardo del Nero, though\r\nhe was far from being among the wealthiest Florentines, had advanced\r\nthe necessary sum of about a thousand florins\xe2\x80\x94a large sum in those\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x94accepting a lien on the collection as a security.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe State will repay me,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to Romola, making light of the\r\nservice, which had really cost him some inconvenience. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the cardinal\r\nfinds a building, as he seems to say he will, our Signoria may consent\r\nto do the rest. I have no children, I can afford the risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut within the last ten days all hopes in the Medici had come to an\r\nend: and the famous Medicean collections in the Via Larga were\r\nthemselves in danger of dispersion. French agents had already begun to\r\nsee that such very fine antique gems as Lorenzo had collected belonged\r\nby right to the first nation in Europe; and the Florentine State, which\r\nhad got possession of the Medicean library, was likely to be glad of a\r\ncustomer for it. With a war to recover Pisa hanging over it, and with\r\nthe certainty of having to pay large subsidies to the French king, the\r\nState was likely to prefer money to manuscripts.\r\n\r\nTo Romola these grave political changes had gathered their chief\r\ninterest from their bearing on the fulfilment of her father\xe2\x80\x99s wish. She\r\nhad been brought up in learned seclusion from the interests of actual\r\nlife, and had been accustomed to think of heroic deeds and great\r\nprinciples as something antithetic to the vulgar present, of the Pnyx\r\nand the Forum as something more worthy of attention than the councils\r\nof living Florentine men. And now the expulsion of the Medici meant\r\nlittle more for her than the extinction of her best hope about her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s library. The times, she knew, were unpleasant for friends of\r\nthe Medici, like her godfather and Tito: superstitious shopkeepers and\r\nthe stupid rabble were full of suspicions; but her new keen interest in\r\npublic events, in the outbreak of war, in the issue of the French\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s visit, in the changes that were likely to happen in the State,\r\nwas kindled solely by the sense of love and duty to her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory. All Romola\xe2\x80\x99s ardour had been concentrated in her affections.\r\nHer share in her father\xe2\x80\x99s learned pursuits had been for her little more\r\nthan a toil which was borne for his sake; and Tito\xe2\x80\x99s airy brilliant\r\nfaculty had no attraction for her that was not merged in the deeper\r\nsympathies that belong to young love and trust. Romola had had contact\r\nwith no mind that could stir the larger possibilities of her nature;\r\nthey lay folded and crushed like embryonic wings, making no element in\r\nher consciousness beyond an occasional vague uneasiness.\r\n\r\nBut this new personal interest of hers in public affairs had made her\r\ncare at last to understand precisely what influence Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npreaching was likely to have on the turn of events. Changes in the form\r\nof the State were talked of, and all she could learn from Tito, whose\r\nsecretaryship and serviceable talents carried him into the heart of\r\npublic business, made her only the more eager to fill out her lonely\r\nday by going to hear for herself what it was that was just now leading\r\nall Florence by the ears. This morning, for the first time, she had\r\nbeen to hear one of the Advent sermons in the Duomo. When Tito had left\r\nher, she had formed a sudden resolution, and after visiting the spot\r\nwhere her father was buried in Santa Croce, had walked on to the Duomo.\r\nThe memory of that last scene with Dino was still vivid within her\r\nwhenever she recalled it, but it had receded behind the experience and\r\nanxieties of her married life. The new sensibilities and questions\r\nwhich it had half awakened in her were quieted again by that subjection\r\nto her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind which is felt by every wife who loves her husband\r\nwith passionate devotedness and full reliance. She remembered the\r\neffect of Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s voice and presence on her as a ground for\r\nexpecting that his sermon might move her in spite of his being a\r\nnarrow-minded monk. But the sermon did no more than slightly deepen her\r\nprevious impression, that this fanatical preacher of tribulations was\r\nafter all a man towards whom it might be possible for her to feel\r\npersonal regard and reverence. The denunciations and exhortations\r\nsimply arrested her attention. She felt no terror, no pangs of\r\nconscience: it was the roll of distant thunder, that seemed grand, but\r\ncould not shake her. But when she heard Savonarola invoke martyrdom,\r\nshe sobbed with the rest: she felt herself penetrated with a new\r\nsensation\xe2\x80\x94a strange sympathy with something apart from all the\r\ndefinable interests of her life. It was not altogether unlike the\r\nthrill which had accompanied certain rare heroic touches in history and\r\npoetry; but the resemblance was as that between the memory of music,\r\nand the sense of being possessed by actual vibrating harmonies.\r\n\r\nBut that transient emotion, strong as it was, seemed to lie quite\r\noutside the inner chamber and sanctuary of her life. She was not\r\nthinking of Fra Girolamo now; she was listening anxiously for the step\r\nof her husband. During these three months of their double solitude she\r\nhad thought of each day as an epoch in which their union might begin to\r\nbe more perfect. She was conscious of being sometimes a little too sad\r\nor too urgent about what concerned her father\xe2\x80\x99s memory\xe2\x80\x94a little too\r\ncritical or coldly silent when Tito narrated the things that were said\r\nand done in the world he frequented\xe2\x80\x94a little too hasty in suggesting\r\nthat by living quite simply as her father had done, they might become\r\nrich enough to pay Bernardo del Nero, and reduce the difficulties about\r\nthe library. It was not possible that Tito could feel so strongly on\r\nthis last point as she did, and it was asking a great deal from him to\r\ngive up luxuries for which he really laboured. The next time Tito came\r\nhome she would be careful to suppress all those promptings that seemed\r\nto isolate her from him. Romola was labouring, as a loving woman must,\r\nto subdue her nature to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s. The great need of her heart\r\ncompelled her to strangle, with desperate resolution, every rising\r\nimpulse of suspicion, pride, and resentment; she felt equal to any\r\nself-infliction that would save her from ceasing to love. That would\r\nhave been like the hideous nightmare in which the world had seemed to\r\nbreak away all round her, and leave her feet overhanging the darkness.\r\nRomola had never distinctly imagined such a future for herself; she was\r\nonly beginning to feel the presence of effort in that clinging trust\r\nwhich had once been mere repose.\r\n\r\nShe waited and listened long, for Tito had not come straight home after\r\nleaving Niccol\xc3\xb2 Caparra, and it was more than two hours after the time\r\nwhen he was crossing the Ponte Rubaconte that Romola heard the great\r\ndoor of the court turning on its hinges, and hastened to the head of\r\nthe stone steps. There was a lamp hanging over the stairs, and they\r\ncould see each other distinctly as he ascended. The eighteen months had\r\nproduced a more definable change in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face than in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s; the\r\nexpression was more subdued, less cold, and more beseeching, and, as\r\nthe pink flush overspread her face now, in her joy that the long\r\nwaiting was at an end, she was much lovelier than on the day when Tito\r\nhad first seen her. On that day, any on-looker would have said that\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s nature was made to command, and Tito\xe2\x80\x99s to bend; yet now\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was quivering a little, and there was some timidity in\r\nher glance.\r\n\r\nHe made an effort to smile, as she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Tito, you are tired; it has been a fatiguing day: is it not true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaso was there, and no more was said until they had crossed the\r\nante-chamber and closed the door of the library behind them. The wood\r\nwas burning brightly on the great dogs; that was one welcome for Tito,\r\nlate as he was, and Romola\xe2\x80\x99s gentle voice was another.\r\n\r\nHe just turned and kissed her when she took off his mantle; then he\r\nwent towards a high-backed chair placed for him near the fire, threw\r\nhimself into it, and flung away his cap, saying, not peevishly, but in\r\na fatigued tone of remonstrance, as he gave a slight shudder\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola, I wish you would give up sitting in this library. Surely our\r\nown rooms are pleasanter in this chill weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola felt hurt. She had never seen Tito so indifferent in his manner;\r\nhe was usually full of lively solicitous attention. And she had thought\r\nso much of his return to her after the long day\xe2\x80\x99s absence! He must be\r\nvery weary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you have forgotten, Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, looking at him\r\nanxiously, as if she wanted to read an excuse for him in the signs of\r\nbodily fatigue. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I am making the catalogue on the new plan\r\nthat my father wished for; you have not time to help me, so I must work\r\nat it closely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, instead of meeting Romola\xe2\x80\x99s glance, closed his eyes and rubbed\r\nhis hands over his face and hair. He felt he was behaving unlike\r\nhimself, but he would make amends to-morrow. The terrible resurrection\r\nof secret fears, which, if Romola had known them, would have alienated\r\nher from him for ever, caused him to feel an alienation already begun\r\nbetween them\xe2\x80\x94caused him to feel a certain repulsion towards a woman\r\nfrom whose mind he was in danger. The feeling had taken hold of him\r\nunawares, and he was vexed with himself for behaving in this new cold\r\nway to her. He could not suddenly command any affectionate looks or\r\nwords; he could only exert himself to say what might serve as an\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not well, Romola; you must not be surprised if I am peevish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have had so much to tire you to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, kneeling\r\ndown close to him, and laying her arm on his chest while she put his\r\nhair back caressingly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she drew her arm away with a start, and a gaze of alarmed\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got under your tunic, Tito? Something as hard as iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ iron\xe2\x80\x94it is chain-armour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at once. He was prepared for\r\nthe surprise and the question, and he spoke quietly, as of something\r\nthat he was not hurried to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was some unexpected danger to-day, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in a tone\r\nof conjecture. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had it lent to you for the procession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it is my own. I shall be obliged to wear it constantly, for some\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that threatens you, my Tito?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, looking\r\nterrified, and clinging to him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one is threatened in these times, who is not a rabid enemy of\r\nthe Medici. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look distressed, my Romola\xe2\x80\x94this armour will make me\r\nsafe against covert attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito put his hand on her neck and smiled. This little dialogue about\r\nthe armour had broken through the new crust, and made a channel for the\r\nsweet habit of kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my godfather, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola; \xe2\x80\x9cis not he, too, in danger? And\r\nhe takes no precautions\xe2\x80\x94ought he not? since he must surely be in more\r\ndanger than you, who have so little influence compared with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just because I am less important that I am in more danger,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, readily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am suspected constantly of being an envoy. And men\r\nlike Messer Bernardo are protected by their position and their\r\nextensive family connections, which spread among all parties, while I\r\nam a Greek that nobody would avenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Tito, is it a fear of some particular person, or only a vague\r\nsense of danger, that has made you think of wearing this?\xe2\x80\x9d Romola was\r\nunable to repel the idea of a degrading fear in Tito, which mingled\r\nitself with her anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had special threats,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must beg you to be\r\nsilent on the subject, my Romola. I shall consider that you have broken\r\nmy confidence, if you mention it to your godfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly I will not mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, blushing, \xe2\x80\x9cif you wish\r\nit to be a secret. But, dearest Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npause, in a tone of loving anxiety, \xe2\x80\x9cit will make you very wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will make me wretched?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a scarcely perceptible\r\nmovement across his face, as from some darting sensation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fear\xe2\x80\x94this heavy armour. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help shuddering as I feel it\r\nunder my arm. I could fancy it a story of enchantment\xe2\x80\x94that some\r\nmalignant fiend had changed your sensitive human skin into a hard\r\nshell. It seems so unlike my bright, light-hearted Tito!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you would rather have your husband exposed to danger, when he\r\nleaves you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my being poniarded\r\nor shot, why need I mind? I will give up the armour\xe2\x80\x94shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tito, no. I am fanciful. Do not heed what I have said. But such\r\ncrimes are surely not common in Florence? I have always heard my father\r\nand godfather say so. Have they become frequent lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not unlikely they will become frequent, with the bitter hatreds\r\nthat are being bred continually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola was silent a few moments. She shrank from insisting further on\r\nthe subject of the armour. She tried to shake it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what has happened to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a cheerful tone. \xe2\x80\x9cHas\r\nall gone off well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellently well. First of all, the rain came and put an end to Luca\r\nCorsini\xe2\x80\x99s oration, which nobody wanted to hear, and a ready-tongued\r\npersonage\xe2\x80\x94some say it was Gaddi, some say it was Melema, but really it\r\nwas done so quickly no one knows who it was\xe2\x80\x94had the honour of giving\r\nthe Cristianissimo the briefest possible welcome in bad French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, it was you, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, smiling brightly, and kissing\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you never care about claiming anything? And after\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! after that, there was a shower of armour and jewels, and\r\ntrappings, such as you saw at the last Florentine _giostra_, only a\r\ngreat deal more of them. There was strutting, and prancing, and\r\nconfusion, and scrambling, and the people shouted, and the\r\nCristianissimo smiled from ear to ear. And after that there was a great\r\ndeal of flattery, and eating, and play. I was at Tornabuoni\xe2\x80\x99s. I will\r\ntell you about it to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dearest, never mind now. But is there any more hope that things\r\nwill end peaceably for Florence, that the Republic will not get into\r\nfresh troubles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito gave a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence will have no peace but what it pays well\r\nfor; that is clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s face saddened, but she checked herself, and said, cheerfully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not guess where I went to-day, Tito. I went to the Duomo, to\r\nhear Fra Girolamo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito looked startled; he had immediately thought of Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentrance into the Duomo; but Romola gave his look another meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are surprised, are you not? It was a sudden thought. I want to\r\nknow all about the public affairs now, and I determined to hear for\r\nmyself what the Frate promised the people about this French invasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what did you think of the prophet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly has a very mysterious power, that man. A great deal of\r\nhis sermon was what I expected; but once I was strangely moved\xe2\x80\x94I sobbed\r\nwith the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, playfully, feeling relieved that she\r\nhad said nothing about Baldassarre; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have a touch of fanaticism in\r\nyou. I shall have you seeing visions, like your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it was the same with every one else. He carried them all with him;\r\nunless it were that gross Dolfo Spini, whom I saw there making\r\ngrimaces. There was even a wretched-looking man, with a rope round his\r\nneck\xe2\x80\x94an escaped prisoner, I should think, who had run in for shelter\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nvery wild-eyed old man: I saw him with great tears rolling down his\r\ncheeks, as he looked and listened quite eagerly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause before Tito spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe prisoner. I was outside the Duomo with\r\nLorenzo Tornabuoni when he ran in. He had escaped from a French\r\nsoldier. Did you see him when you came out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he went out with our good old Piero di Cosimo. I saw Piero come in\r\nand cut off his rope, and take him out of the church. But you want\r\nrest, Tito? You feel ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, rising. The horrible sense that he must live in\r\ncontinual dread of what Baldassarre had said or done pressed upon him\r\nlike a cold weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nThe Painted Record.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days later, Romola was on her way to the house of Piero di Cosimo,\r\nin the Via Gualfonda. Some of the streets through which she had to pass\r\nwere lined with Frenchmen who were gazing at Florence, and with\r\nFlorentines who were gazing at the French, and the gaze was not on\r\neither side entirely friendly and admiring. The first nation in Europe,\r\nof necessity finding itself, when out of its own country, in the\r\npresence of general inferiority, naturally assumed an air of conscious\r\npre-eminence; and the Florentines, who had taken such pains to play the\r\nhost amiably, were getting into the worst humour with their too\r\nsuperior guests.\r\n\r\nFor after the first smiling compliments and festivities were over\xe2\x80\x94after\r\nwondrous Mysteries with unrivalled machinery of floating clouds and\r\nangels had been presented in churches\xe2\x80\x94after the royal guest had\r\nhonoured Florentine dames with much of his Most Christian ogling at\r\nballs and suppers, and business had begun to be talked of\xe2\x80\x94it appeared\r\nthat the new Charlemagne regarded Florence as a conquered city,\r\ninasmuch as he had entered it with his lance in rest, talked of leaving\r\nhis viceroy behind him, and had thoughts of bringing back the Medici.\r\nSingular logic this appeared to be on the part of an elect instrument\r\nof God! since the policy of Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, disowned by the people,\r\nhad been the only offence of Florence against the majesty of France.\r\nAnd Florence was determined not to submit. The determination was being\r\nexpressed very strongly in consultations of citizens inside the Old\r\nPalace, and it was beginning to show itself on the broad flags of the\r\nstreets and piazza wherever there was an opportunity of flouting an\r\ninsolent Frenchman. Under these circumstances the streets were not\r\naltogether a pleasant promenade for well-born women; but Romola,\r\nshrouded in her black veil and mantle, and with old Maso by her side,\r\nfelt secure enough from impertinent observation.\r\n\r\nAnd she was impatient to visit Piero di Cosimo. A copy of her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait as Oedipus, which he had long ago undertaken to make for her,\r\nwas not yet finished; and Piero was so uncertain in his work\xe2\x80\x94sometimes,\r\nwhen the demand was not peremptory, laying aside a picture for months;\r\nsometimes thrusting it into a corner or coffer, where it was likely to\r\nbe utterly forgotten\xe2\x80\x94that she felt it necessary to watch over his\r\nprogress. She was a favourite with the painter, and he was inclined to\r\nfulfil any wish of hers, but no general inclination could be trusted as\r\na safeguard against his sudden whims. He had told her the week before\r\nthat the picture would perhaps be finished by this time; and Romola was\r\nnervously anxious to have in her possession a copy of the only portrait\r\nexisting of her father in the days of his blindness, lest his image\r\nshould grow dim in her mind. The sense of defect in her devotedness to\r\nhim made her cling with all the force of compunction as well as\r\naffection to the duties of memory. Love does not aim simply at the\r\nconscious good of the beloved object: it is not satisfied without\r\nperfect loyalty of heart; it aims at its own completeness.\r\n\r\nRomola, by special favour, was allowed to intrude upon the painter\r\nwithout previous notice. She lifted the iron slide and called Piero in\r\na flute-like tone, as the little maiden with the eggs had done in\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Piero was quick in answering, but when he opened the\r\ndoor he accounted for his quickness in a manner that was not\r\ncomplimentary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Madonna Romola, is it you? I thought my eggs were come; I wanted\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought you something better than hard eggs, Piero. Maso has\r\ngot a little basket full of cakes and _confetti_ for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nsmiling, as she put back her veil. She took the basket from Maso, and\r\nstepping into the house, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you like these things when you can have them without trouble.\r\nConfess you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when they come to me as easily as the light does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero,\r\nfolding his arms and looking down at the sweetmeats as Romola uncovered\r\nthem and glanced at him archly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they are come along with the light\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, lifting his eyes to her face and hair with a painter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmiration, as her hood, dragged by the weight of her veil, fell\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know what the sweetmeats are for,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are to stop\r\nmy mouth while you scold me. Well, go on into the next room, and you\r\nwill see I\xe2\x80\x99ve done something to the picture since you saw it, though\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not finished yet. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t promise, you know: I take care not\r\nto promise:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Chi promette e non mantiene\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99anima sua non va mai bene.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door opening on the wild garden was closed now, and the painter was\r\nat work. Not at Romola\xe2\x80\x99s picture, however. That was standing on the\r\nfloor, propped against the wall, and Piero stooped to lift it, that he\r\nmight carry it into the proper light. But in lifting away this picture,\r\nhe had disclosed another\xe2\x80\x94the oil-sketch of Tito, to which he had made\r\nan important addition within the last few days. It was so much smaller\r\nthan the other picture, that it stood far within it, and Piero, apt to\r\nforget where he had placed anything, was not aware of what he had\r\nrevealed as, peering at some detail in the painting which he held in\r\nhis hands, he went to place it on an easel. But Romola exclaimed,\r\nflushing with astonishment\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Tito!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiero looked round, and gave a silent shrug. He was vexed at his own\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\nShe was still looking at the sketch in astonishment; but presently she\r\nturned towards the painter, and said with puzzled alarm\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange picture! When did you paint it? What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mere fancy of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, lifting off his skull-cap,\r\nscratching his head, and making the usual grimace by which he avoided\r\nthe betrayal of any feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted a handsome young face for it,\r\nand your husband\xe2\x80\x99s was just the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went forward, stooped down to the picture, and lifting it away with\r\nits back to Romola, pretended to be giving it a passing examination,\r\nbefore putting it aside as a thing not good enough to show.\r\n\r\nBut Romola, who had the fact of the armour in her mind, and was\r\npenetrated by this strange coincidence of things which associated Tito\r\nwith the idea of fear, went to his elbow and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it away; let me look again. That man with the rope round his\r\nneck\xe2\x80\x94I saw him\xe2\x80\x94I saw you come to him in the Duomo. What was it that\r\nmade you put him into a picture with Tito?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiero saw no better resource than to tell part of the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mere accident. The man was running away\xe2\x80\x94running up the steps,\r\nand caught hold of your husband: I suppose he had stumbled. I happened\r\nto be there, and saw it, and I thought the savage-looking old fellow\r\nwas a good subject. But it\xe2\x80\x99s worth nothing\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only a freakish daub of\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d Piero ended contemptuously, moving the sketch away with an air\r\nof decision, and putting it on a high shelf. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and look at the\r\nOedipus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had shown a little too much anxiety in putting the sketch out of her\r\nsight, and had produced the very impression he had sought to\r\nprevent\xe2\x80\x94that there was really something unpleasant, something\r\ndisadvantageous to Tito, in the circumstances out of which the picture\r\narose. But this impression silenced her: her pride and delicacy shrank\r\nfrom questioning further, where questions might seem to imply that she\r\ncould entertain even a slight suspicion against her husband. She merely\r\nsaid, in as quiet a tone as she could\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a strange piteous-looking man, that prisoner. Do you know\r\nanything more of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more: I showed him the way to the hospital, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. See, now,\r\nthe face of Oedipus is pretty nearly finished; tell me what you think\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola now gave her whole attention to her father\xe2\x80\x99s portrait, standing\r\nin long silence before it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have done what I wanted. You have given it\r\nmore of the listening look. My good Piero,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she turned towards him with\r\nbright moist eyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am very grateful to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s what I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear in you women,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, turning\r\nimpatiently, and kicking aside the objects that littered the floor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare always pouring out feelings where there\xe2\x80\x99s no call for them. Why\r\nshould you be grateful to me for a picture you pay me for, especially\r\nwhen I make you wait for it? And if I paint a picture, I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor my own pleasure and credit to paint it well, eh? Are you to thank a\r\nman for not being a rogue or a noodle? It\xe2\x80\x99s enough if he himself thanks\r\nMesser Domeneddio, who has made him neither the one nor the other. But\r\nwomen think walls are held together with honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou crusty Piero! I forgot how snappish you are. Here, put this nice\r\nsweetmeat in your mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, smiling through her tears, and\r\ntaking something very crisp and sweet from the little basket.\r\n\r\nPiero accepted it very much as that proverbial bear that dreams of\r\npears might accept an exceedingly mellow \xe2\x80\x9cswan-egg\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94really liking the\r\ngift, but accustomed to have his pleasures and pains concealed under a\r\nshaggy coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good, Madonna Antigone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, putting his fingers in the\r\nbasket for another. He had eaten nothing but hard eggs for a fortnight.\r\nRomola stood opposite him, feeling her new anxiety suspended for a\r\nlittle while by the sight of this _na\xc3\xafve_ enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Piero,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, presently, setting down the basket. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npromise not to thank you if you finish the portrait soon and well I\r\nwill tell you, you were bound to do it for your own credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, curtly, helping her with much deftness to fold her\r\nmantle and veil round her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad she asked no more questions about that sketch,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\r\nwhen he had closed the door behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry for her to\r\nguess that I thought her fine husband a good model for a coward. But I\r\nmade light of it; she\xe2\x80\x99ll not think of it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiero was too sanguine, as open-hearted men are apt to be when they\r\nattempt a little clever simulation. The thought of the picture pressed\r\nmore and more on Romola as she walked homeward. She could not help\r\nputting together the two facts of the chain-armour and the encounter\r\nmentioned by Piero between her husband and the prisoner, which had\r\nhappened on the morning of the day when the armour was adopted. That\r\nlook of terror which the painter had given Tito, had he seen it? What\r\ncould it all mean?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she tried to assure herself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mere\r\ncoincidence. Shall I ask Tito about it?\xe2\x80\x9d Her mind said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cNo: I\r\nwill not question him about anything he did not tell me spontaneously.\r\nIt is an offence against the trust I owe him.\xe2\x80\x9d Her heart said, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare\r\nnot ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a terrible flaw in the trust: she was afraid of any hasty\r\nmovement, as men are who hold something precious and want to believe\r\nthat it is not broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nA Moment of Triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old fellow has vanished; went on towards Arezzo the next morning;\r\nnot liking the smell of the French, I suppose, after being their\r\nprisoner. I went to the hospital to inquire after him; I wanted to know\r\nif those broth-making monks had found out whether he was in his right\r\nmind or not. However, they said he showed no signs of madness\xe2\x80\x94only took\r\nno notice of questions, and seemed to be planting a vine twenty miles\r\noff. He was a mysterious old tiger. I should have liked to know\r\nsomething more about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in Nello\xe2\x80\x99s shop that Piero di Cosimo was speaking, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of November, just a week after the entrance of the\r\nFrench. There was a party of six or seven assembled at the rather\r\nunusual hour of three in the afternoon; for it was a day on which all\r\nFlorence was excited by the prospect of some decisive political event.\r\nEvery lounging-place was full, and every shopkeeper who had no wife or\r\ndeputy to leave in charge, stood at his door with his thumbs in his\r\nbelt; while the streets were constantly sprinkled with artisans pausing\r\nor passing lazily like floating splinters, ready to rush forward\r\nimpetuously if any object attracted them.\r\n\r\nNello had been thrumming the lute as he half sat on the board against\r\nthe shop-window, and kept an outlook towards the piazza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying down the lute, with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not for a\r\ngold florin have missed that sight of the French soldiers waddling in\r\ntheir broad shoes after their runaway prisoners! That comes of leaving\r\nmy shop to shave magnificent chins. It is always so: if ever I quit\r\nthis navel of the earth something takes the opportunity of happening in\r\nmy piazza.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you ought to have been there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, in his biting way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cjust to see your favourite Greek look as frightened as if Satanasso\r\nhad laid hold of him. I like to see your ready-smiling Messeri caught\r\nin a sudden wind and obliged to show their lining in spite of\r\nthemselves. What colour do you think a man\xe2\x80\x99s liver is, who looks like a\r\nbleached deer as soon as a chance stranger lays hold of him suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPiero, keep that vinegar of thine as sauce to thine own eggs! What is\r\nit against my _bel erudito_ that he looked startled when he felt a pair\r\nof claws upon him and saw an unchained madman at his elbow? Your\r\nscholar is not like those beastly Swiss and Germans, whose heads are\r\nonly fit for battering-rams, and who have such large appetites that\r\nthey think nothing of taking a cannon-ball before breakfast. We\r\nFlorentines count some other qualities in a man besides that vulgar\r\nstuff called bravery, which is to be got by hiring dunderheads at so\r\nmuch per dozen. I tell you, as soon as men found out that they had more\r\nbrains than oxen, they set the oxen to draw for them; and when we\r\nFlorentines found out that we had more brains than other men we set\r\nthem to fight for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTreason, Nello!\xe2\x80\x9d a voice called out from the inner sanctum; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is\r\nnot the doctrine of the State. Florence is grinding its weapons; and\r\nthe last well-authenticated vision announced by the Frate was Mars\r\nstanding on the Palazzo Vecchio with his arm on the shoulder of San\r\nGiovanni Battista, who was offering him a piece of honeycomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well, Francesco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello. \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence has a few thicker skulls\r\nthat may do to bombard Pisa with; there will still be the finer spirits\r\nleft at home to do the thinking and the shaving. And as for our Piero\r\nhere, if he makes such a point of valour, let him carry his biggest\r\nbrush for a weapon and his palette for a shield, and challenge the\r\nwidest-mouthed Swiss he can see in the Prato to a single combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Va_, Nello,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Piero, \xe2\x80\x9cthy tongue runs on as usual, like a mill\r\nwhen the Arno\xe2\x80\x99s full\xe2\x80\x94whether there\xe2\x80\x99s grist or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent grist, I tell thee. For it would be as reasonable to expect\r\na grizzled painter like thee to be fond of getting a javelin inside\r\nthee as to expect a man whose wits have been sharpened on the classics\r\nto like having his handsome face clawed by a wild beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go, supposing you\xe2\x80\x99ll get people to put their legs into a\r\nsack because you call it a pair of hosen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said\r\nanything about a wild beast, or about an unarmed man rushing on battle?\r\nFighting is a trade, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my trade. I should be a fool to run\r\nafter danger, but I could face it if it came to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you\xe2\x80\x99re so afraid of the thunder, then, my Piero?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNello, determined to chase down the accuser. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be able to\r\nunderstand why one man is shaken by a thing that seems a trifle to\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94you who hide yourself with the rats as soon as a storm comes\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I have a particular sensibility to loud sounds; it has\r\nnothing to do with my courage or my conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and Tito Melema may have a peculiar sensibility to being laid\r\nhold of unexpectedly by prisoners who have run away from French\r\nsoldiers. Men are born with antipathies; I myself can\xe2\x80\x99t abide the smell\r\nof mint. Tito was born with an antipathy to old prisoners who stumble\r\nand clutch. Ecco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh at Nello\xe2\x80\x99s defence, and it was clear that\r\nPiero\xe2\x80\x99s disinclination towards Tito was not shared by the company. The\r\npainter, with his undecipherable grimace, took the tow from his\r\nscarsella and stuffed his ears in indignant contempt, while Nello went\r\non triumphantly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my Piero, I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have my _bel erudito_ decried; and\r\nFlorence can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it either, with her scholars moulting off her at\r\nthe early age of forty. Our Phoenix Pico just gone straight to\r\nParadise, as the Frate has informed us; and the incomparable Poliziano,\r\nnot two months since, gone to\xe2\x80\x94well, well, let us hope he is not gone to\r\nthe eminent scholars in the Malebolge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesco Cei, \xe2\x80\x9chave you heard that Camilla Rucellai\r\nhas outdone the Frate in her prophecies? She prophesied two years ago\r\nthat Pico would die in the time of lilies. He has died in November.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all the time of lilies,\xe2\x80\x99 said the scorners. \xe2\x80\x98Go to!\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nCamilla; \xe2\x80\x98it is the lilies of France I meant, and it seems to me they\r\nare close enough under your nostrils.\xe2\x80\x99 I say, \xe2\x80\x98Euge, Camilla!\xe2\x80\x99 If the\r\nFrate can prove that any one of his visions has been as well fulfilled,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll declare myself a Piagnone to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are something too flippant about the Frate, Francesco,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPietro Cennini, the scholarly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all indebted to him in these\r\nweeks for preaching peace and quietness, and the laying aside of party\r\nquarrels. They are men of small discernment who would be glad to see\r\nthe people slipping the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s leash just now. And if the Most\r\nChristian King is obstinate about the treaty to-day, and will not sign\r\nwhat is fair and honourable to Florence, Fra Girolamo is the man we\r\nmust trust in to bring him to reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak truth, Messer Pietro,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Frate is one of the\r\nfirmest nails Florence has to hang on\xe2\x80\x94at least, that is the opinion of\r\nthe most respectable chins I have the honour of shaving. But young\r\nMesser Niccol\xc3\xb2 was saying here the other morning\xe2\x80\x94and doubtless\r\nFrancesco means the same thing\xe2\x80\x94there is as wonderful a power of\r\nstretching in the meaning of visions as in Dido\xe2\x80\x99s bull\xe2\x80\x99s hide. It seems\r\nto me a dream may mean whatever comes after it. As our Franco Sacchetti\r\nsays, a woman dreams over-night of a serpent biting her, breaks a\r\ndrinking-cup the next day, and cries out, \xe2\x80\x98Look you, I thought\r\nsomething would happen\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s plain now what the serpent meant.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s visions are not of that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronaca. \xe2\x80\x9cHe not\r\nonly says what will happen\xe2\x80\x94that the Church will be scourged and\r\nrenovated, and the heathens converted\xe2\x80\x94he says it shall happen quickly.\r\nHe is no slippery pretender who provides loopholes for himself, he is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this? what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nello, jumping off the board,\r\nand putting his head out at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are people streaming into\r\nthe piazza, and shouting. Something must have happened in the Via\r\nLarga. Aha!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst forth with delighted astonishment, stepping out\r\nlaughing and waving his cap.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the company hastened to the door. News from the Via\r\nLarga was just what they had been waiting for. But if the news had come\r\ninto the piazza, they were not a little surprised at the form of its\r\nadvent. Carried above the shoulders of the people, on a bench\r\napparently snatched up in the street, sat Tito Melema, in smiling\r\namusement at the compulsion he was under. His cap had slipped off his\r\nhead, and hung by the becchetto which was wound loosely round his neck;\r\nand as he saw the group at Nello\xe2\x80\x99s door he lifted up his fingers in\r\nbeckoning recognition. The next minute he had leaped from the bench on\r\nto a cart filled with bales, that stood in the broad space between the\r\nBaptistery and the steps of the Duomo, while the people swarmed round\r\nhim with the noisy eagerness of poultry expecting to be fed. But there\r\nwas silence when he began to speak in his clear mellow voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCitizens of Florence! I have no warrant to tell the news except your\r\nwill. But the news is good, and will harm no man in the telling. The\r\nMost Christian King is signing a treaty that is honourable to Florence.\r\nBut you owe it to one of your citizens, who spoke a word worthy of the\r\nancient Romans\xe2\x80\x94you owe it to Piero Capponi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately there was a roar of voices. \xe2\x80\x9cCapponi! Capponi! What said\r\nour Piero?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAh! he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand being sent from Herod to Pilate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe knew Piero!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Ors\xc3\xb9_! Tell us, what did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the roar of insistence had subsided a little, Tito began again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Most Christian King demanded a little too much\xe2\x80\x94was obstinate\xe2\x80\x94said\r\nat last, \xe2\x80\x98I shall order my trumpets to sound.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, Florentine\r\ncitizens! your Piero Capponi, speaking with the voice of a free city,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98If you sound your trumpets, we will ring our bells!\xe2\x80\x99 He snatched\r\nthe copy of the dishonouring conditions from the hands of the\r\nsecretary, tore it in pieces, and turned to leave the royal presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there were loud shouts\xe2\x80\x94and again impatient demands for more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Florentines, the high majesty of France felt, perhaps for the\r\nfirst time, all the majesty of a free city. And the Most Christian King\r\nhimself hastened from his place to call Piero Capponi back. The great\r\nspirit of your Florentine city did its work by a great word, without\r\nneed of the great actions that lay ready behind it. And the King has\r\nconsented to sign the treaty, which preserves the honour, as well as\r\nthe safety, of Florence. The banner of France will float over every\r\nFlorentine galley in sign of amity and common privilege, but above that\r\nbanner will be written the word \xe2\x80\x98Liberty!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all the news I have to tell; is it not enough?\xe2\x80\x94since it is for\r\nthe glory of every one of you, citizens of Florence, that you have a\r\nfellow-citizen who knows how to speak your will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the shouts rose again, Tito looked round with inward amusement at\r\nthe various crowd, each of whom was elated with the notion that Piero\r\nCapponi had somehow represented him\xe2\x80\x94that he was the mind of which\r\nCapponi was the mouthpiece. He enjoyed the humour of the incident,\r\nwhich had suddenly transformed him, an alien, and a friend of the\r\nMedici, into an orator who tickled the ears of the people blatant for\r\nsome unknown good which they called liberty. He felt quite glad that he\r\nhad been laid hold of and hurried along by the crowd as he was coming\r\nout of the palace in the Via Larga with a commission to the Signoria.\r\nIt was very easy, very pleasant, this exercise of speaking to the\r\ngeneral satisfaction: a man who knew how to persuade need never be in\r\ndanger from any party; he could convince each that he was feigning with\r\nall the others. The gestures and faces of weavers and dyers were\r\ncertainly amusing when looked at from above in this way.\r\n\r\nTito was beginning to get easier in his armour, and at this moment was\r\nquite unconscious of it. He stood with one hand holding his recovered\r\ncap, and with the other at his belt, the light of a complacent smile in\r\nhis long lustrous eyes, as he made a parting reverence to his audience,\r\nbefore springing down from the bales\xe2\x80\x94when suddenly his glance met that\r\nof a man who had not at all the amusing aspect of the exulting weavers,\r\ndyers, and woolcarders. The face of this man was clean-shaven, his hair\r\nclose-clipped, and he wore a decent felt hat. A single glance would\r\nhardly have sufficed to assure any one but Tito that this was the face\r\nof the escaped prisoner who had laid hold of him on the steps. But to\r\nTito it came not simply as the face of the escaped prisoner, but as a\r\nface with which he had been familiar long years before.\r\n\r\nIt seemed all compressed into a second\xe2\x80\x94the sight of Baldassarre looking\r\nat him, the sensation shooting through him like a fiery arrow, and the\r\nact of leaping from the cart. He would have leaped down in the same\r\ninstant, whether he had seen Baldassarre or not, for he was in a hurry\r\nto be gone to the Palazzo Vecchio: this time he had not betrayed\r\nhimself by look or movement, and he said inwardly that he should not be\r\ntaken by surprise again; he should be prepared to see this face rise up\r\ncontinually like the intermittent blotch that comes in diseased vision.\r\nBut this reappearance of Baldassarre so much more in his own likeness\r\ntightened the pressure of dread: the idea of his madness lost its\r\nlikelihood now he was shaven and clad like a decent though poor\r\ncitizen. Certainly, there was a great change in his face; but how could\r\nit be otherwise? And yet, if he were perfectly sane\xe2\x80\x94in possession of\r\nall his powers and all his learning, why was he lingering in this way\r\nbefore making known his identity? It must be for the sake of making his\r\nscheme of vengeance more complete. But he did linger: that at least\r\ngave an opportunity for flight. And Tito began to think that flight was\r\nhis only resource.\r\n\r\nBut while he, with his back turned on the Piazza del Duomo, had lost\r\nthe recollection of the new part he had been playing, and was no longer\r\nthinking of the many things which a ready brain and tongue made easy,\r\nbut of a few things which destiny had somehow made very difficult, the\r\nenthusiasm which he had fed contemptuously was creating a scene in that\r\npiazza in grand contrast with the inward drama of self-centred fear\r\nwhich he had carried away from it.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, had begun to turn their faces\r\ntowards the outlets of the piazza in the direction of the Via Larga,\r\nwhen the sight of _mazzieri_, or mace-bearers, entering from the Via\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Martelli, announced the approach of dignitaries. They must be the\r\nsyndics, or commissioners charged with the effecting of the treaty; the\r\ntreaty must be already signed, and they had come away from the royal\r\npresence. Piero Capponi was coming\xe2\x80\x94the brave heart that had known how\r\nto speak for Florence. The effect on the crowd was remarkable; they\r\nparted with softening, dropping voices, subsiding into silence,\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nsilence became so perfect that the tread of the syndics on the broad\r\npavement, and the rustle of their black silk garments, could be heard,\r\nlike rain in the night. There were four of them; but it was not the two\r\nlearned doctors of law, Messer Guidantonio Vespucci and Messer Domenico\r\nBonsi, that the crowd waited for; it was not Francesco Valori, popular\r\nas he had become in these late days. The moment belonged to another\r\nman, of firm presence, as little inclined to humour the people as to\r\nhumour any other unreasonable claimants\xe2\x80\x94loving order, like one who by\r\nforce of fortune had been made a merchant, and by force of nature had\r\nbecome a soldier. It was not till he was seen at the entrance of the\r\npiazza that the silence was broken, and then one loud shout of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapponi, Capponi! Well done, Capponi!\xe2\x80\x9d rang through the piazza.\r\n\r\nThe simple, resolute man looked round him with grave joy. His\r\nfellow-citizens gave him a great funeral two years later, when he had\r\ndied in fight; there were torches carried by all the magistracy, and\r\ntorches again, and trains of banners. But it is not known that he felt\r\nany joy in the oration that was delivered in his praise, as the banners\r\nwaved over his bier. Let us be glad that he got some thanks and praise\r\nwhile he lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nThe Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s Secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Baldassarre had been in the Piazza del Duomo\r\nsince his escape. He had a strong desire to hear the remarkable monk\r\npreach again, but he had shrunk from reappearing in the same spot where\r\nhe had been seen half naked, with neglected hair, with a rope round his\r\nneck\xe2\x80\x94in the same spot where he had been called a madman. The feeling,\r\nin its freshness, was too strong to be overcome by any trust he had in\r\nthe change he had made in his appearance; for when the words \xe2\x80\x9c_some\r\nmadman, surely_,\xe2\x80\x9d had fallen from Tito\xe2\x80\x99s lips, it was not their\r\nbaseness and cruelty only that had made their viper sting\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nBaldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s instantaneous bitter consciousness that he might be\r\nunable to prove the words false. Along with the passionate desire for\r\nvengeance which possessed him had arisen the keen sense that his power\r\nof achieving the vengeance was doubtful. It was as if Tito had been\r\nhelped by some diabolical prompter, who had whispered Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaddest secret in the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s ear. He was not mad; for he carried\r\nwithin him that piteous stamp of sanity, the clear consciousness of\r\nshattered faculties; he measured his own feebleness. With the first\r\nmovement of vindictive rage awoke a vague caution, like that of a wild\r\nbeast that is fierce but feeble\xe2\x80\x94or like that of an insect whose little\r\nfragment of earth has given way, and made it pause in a palsy of\r\ndistrust. It was this distrust, this determination to take no step\r\nwhich might betray anything concerning himself, that had made\r\nBaldassarre reject Piero di Cosimo\xe2\x80\x99s friendly advances.\r\n\r\nHe had been equally cautious at the hospital, only telling, in answer\r\nto the questions of the brethren there, that he had been made a\r\nprisoner by the French on his way from Genoa. But his age, and the\r\nindications in his speech and manner that he was of a different class\r\nfrom the ordinary mendicants and poor travellers who were entertained\r\nin the hospital, had induced the monks to offer him extra charity: a\r\ncoarse woollen tunic to protect him from the cold, a pair of peasant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoes, and a few _danari_, smallest of Florentine coins, to help him on\r\nhis way. He had gone on the road to Arezzo early in the morning; but he\r\nhad paused at the first little town, and had used a couple of his\r\n_danari_ to get himself shaved, and to have his circle of hair clipped\r\nshort, in his former fashion. The barber there had a little hand-mirror\r\nof bright steel: it was a long while, it was years, since Baldassarre\r\nhad looked at himself, and now, as his eyes fell on that hand-mirror, a\r\nnew thought shot through his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWas he so changed that Tito really\r\ndid not know him?\xe2\x80\x9d The thought was such a sudden arrest of impetuous\r\ncurrents, that it was a painful shock to him; his hand shook like a\r\nleaf, as he put away the barber\xe2\x80\x99s arm and asked for the mirror. He\r\nwished to see himself before he was shaved. The barber, noticing his\r\ntremulousness, held the mirror for him.\r\n\r\nNo, he was not so changed as that. He himself had known the wrinkles as\r\nthey had been three years ago; they were only deeper now: there was the\r\nsame rough, clumsy skin, making little superficial bosses on the brow,\r\nlike so many cipher-marks; the skin was only yellower, only looked more\r\nlike a lifeless rind. That shaggy white beard\xe2\x80\x94it was no disguise to\r\neyes that had looked closely at him for sixteen years\xe2\x80\x94to eyes that\r\nought to have searched for him with the expectation of finding him\r\nchanged, as men search for the beloved among the bodies cast up by the\r\nwaters. There was something different in his glance, but it was a\r\ndifference that should only have made the recognition of him the more\r\nstartling; for is not a known voice all the more thrilling when it is\r\nheard as a cry? But the doubt was folly: he had felt that Tito knew\r\nhim. He put out his hand and pushed the mirror away. The strong\r\ncurrents were rushing on again, and the energies of hatred and\r\nvengeance were active once more.\r\n\r\nHe went back on the way towards Florence again, but he did not wish to\r\nenter the city till dusk; so he turned aside from the highroad, and sat\r\ndown by a little pool shadowed on one side by alder-bushes still\r\nsprinkled with yellow leaves. It was a calm November day, and he no\r\nsooner saw the pool than he thought its still surface might be a mirror\r\nfor him. He wanted to contemplate himself slowly, as he had not dared\r\nto do in the presence of the barber. He sat down on the edge of the\r\npool, and bent forward to look earnestly at the image of himself.\r\n\r\nWas there something wandering and imbecile in his face\xe2\x80\x94something like\r\nwhat he felt in his mind?\r\n\r\nNot now; not when he was examining himself with a look of eager\r\ninquiry: on the contrary, there was an intense purpose in his eyes. But\r\nat other times? Yes, it must be so: in the long hours when he had the\r\nvague aching of an unremembered past within him\xe2\x80\x94when he seemed to sit\r\nin dark loneliness, visited by whispers which died out mockingly as he\r\nstrained his ear after them, and by forms that seemed to approach him\r\nand float away as he thrust out his hand to grasp them\xe2\x80\x94in those hours,\r\ndoubtless, there must be continual frustration and amazement in his\r\nglance. And more horrible still, when the thick cloud parted for a\r\nmoment, and, as he sprang forward with hope, rolled together again, and\r\nleft him helpless as before; doubtless, there was then a blank\r\nconfusion in his face, as of a man suddenly smitten with blindness.\r\n\r\nCould he prove anything? Could he even begin to allege anything, with\r\nthe confidence that the links of thought would not break away? Would\r\nany believe that he had ever had a mind filled with rare knowledge,\r\nbusy with close thoughts, ready with various speech? It had all slipped\r\naway from him\xe2\x80\x94that laboriously-gathered store. Was it utterly and for\r\never gone from him, like the waters from an urn lost in the wide ocean?\r\nOr, was it still within him, imprisoned by some obstruction that might\r\none day break asunder?\r\n\r\nIt might be so; he tried to keep his grasp on that hope. For, since the\r\nday when he had first walked feebly from his couch of straw, and had\r\nfelt a new darkness within him under the sunlight, his mind had\r\nundergone changes, partly gradual and persistent, partly sudden and\r\nfleeting. As he had recovered his strength of body, he had recovered\r\nhis self-command and the energy of his will; he had recovered the\r\nmemory of all that part of his life which was closely enwrought with\r\nhis emotions; and he had felt more and more constantly and painfully\r\nthe uneasy sense of lost knowledge. But more than that\xe2\x80\x94once or twice,\r\nwhen he had been strongly excited, he had seemed momentarily to be in\r\nentire possession of his past self, as old men doze for an instant and\r\nget back the consciousness of their youth: he seemed again to see Greek\r\npages and understand them, again to feel his mind moving unbenumbed\r\namong familiar ideas. It had been but a flash, and the darkness closing\r\nin again seemed the more horrible; but might not the same thing happen\r\nagain for longer periods? If it would only come and stay long enough\r\nfor him to achieve a revenge\xe2\x80\x94devise an exquisite suffering, such as a\r\nmere right arm could never inflict!\r\n\r\nHe raised himself from his stooping attitude, and, folding his arms,\r\nattempted to concentrate all his mental force on the plan he must\r\nimmediately pursue. He had to wait for knowledge and opportunity, and\r\nwhile he waited he must have the means of living without beggary. What\r\nhe dreaded of all things now was, that any one should think him a\r\nfoolish, helpless old man. No one must know that half his memory was\r\ngone: the lost strength might come again; and if it were only for a\r\nlittle while, _that_ might be enough.\r\n\r\nHe knew how to begin to get the information he wanted about Tito. He\r\nhad repeated the words \xe2\x80\x9cBratti Ferravecchi\xe2\x80\x9d so constantly after they\r\nhad been uttered to him, that they never slipped from him for long\r\ntogether. A man at Genoa, on whose finger he had seen Tito\xe2\x80\x99s ring, had\r\ntold him that he bought that ring at Florence, of a young Greek,\r\nwell-dressed, and with a handsome dark face, in the shop of a\r\n_rigattiere_ called Bratti Ferravecchi, in the street also called\r\nFerravecchi. This discovery had caused a violent agitation in\r\nBaldassarre. Until then he had clung with all the tenacity of his\r\nfervent nature to his faith in Tito, and had not for a moment believed\r\nhimself to be wilfully forsaken. At first he had said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy bit of\r\nparchment has never reached him; that is why I am still toiling at\r\nAntioch. But he is searching; he knows where I was lost: he will trace\r\nme out, and find me at last.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, when he was taken to Corinth, he\r\ninduced his owners, by the assurance that he should be sought out and\r\nransomed, to provide securely against the failure of any inquiries that\r\nmight be made about him at Antioch; and at Corinth he thought joyfully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, at last, he must find me. Here he is sure to touch, whichever\r\nway he goes.\xe2\x80\x9d But before another year had passed, the illness had come\r\nfrom which he had risen with body and mind so shattered that he was\r\nworse than worthless to his owners, except for the sake of the ransom\r\nthat did not come. Then, as he sat helpless in the morning sunlight, he\r\nbegan to think, \xe2\x80\x9cTito has been drowned, or they have made _him_ a\r\nprisoner too. I shall see him no more. He set out after me, but\r\nmisfortune overtook him. I shall see his face no more.\xe2\x80\x9d Sitting in his\r\nnew feebleness and despair, supporting his head between his hands, with\r\nblank eyes and lips that moved uncertainly, he looked so much like a\r\nhopelessly imbecile old man, that his owners were contented to be rid\r\nof him, and allowed a Genoese merchant, who had compassion on him as an\r\nItalian, to take him on board his galley. In a voyage of many months in\r\nthe Archipelago and along the seaboard of Asia Minor, Baldassarre had\r\nrecovered his bodily strength, but on landing at Genoa he had so weary\r\na sense of his desolateness that he almost wished he had died of that\r\nillness at Corinth. There was just one possibility that hindered the\r\nwish from being decided: it was that Tito might not be dead, but living\r\nin a state of imprisonment or destitution; and if he lived, there was\r\nstill a hope for Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x94faint, perhaps, and likely to be long\r\ndeferred, but still a hope, that he might find his child, his cherished\r\nson again; might yet again clasp hands and meet face to face with the\r\none being who remembered him as he had been before his mind was broken.\r\nIn this state of feeling he had chanced to meet the stranger who wore\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s onyx ring, and though Baldassarre would have been unable to\r\ndescribe the ring beforehand, the sight of it stirred the dormant\r\nfibres, and he recognised it. That Tito nearly a year after his father\r\nhad been parted from him should have been living in apparent prosperity\r\nat Florence, selling the gem which he ought not to have sold till the\r\nlast extremity, was a fact that Baldassarre shrank from trying to\r\naccount for: he was glad to be stunned and bewildered by it, rather\r\nthan to have any distinct thought; he tried to feel nothing but joy\r\nthat he should behold Tito again. Perhaps Tito had thought that his\r\nfather was dead; somehow the mystery would be explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at least\r\nI shall meet eyes that will remember me. I am not alone in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now again Baldassarre said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not alone in the world; I shall\r\nnever be alone, for my revenge is with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as the instrument of that revenge, as something merely external\r\nand subservient to his true life, that he bent down again to examine\r\nhimself with hard curiosity\xe2\x80\x94not, he thought, because he had any care\r\nfor a withered, forsaken old man, whom nobody loved, whose soul was\r\nlike a deserted home, where the ashes were cold upon the hearth, and\r\nthe walls were bare of all but the marks of what had been. It is in the\r\nnature of all human passion, the lowest as well as the highest, that\r\nthere is a point where it ceases to be properly egoistic, and is like a\r\nfire kindled within our being to which everything else in us is mere\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the pale black-browed image in the water till he\r\nidentified it with that self from which his revenge seemed to be a\r\nthing apart; and he felt as if the image too heard the silent language\r\nof his thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a loving fool\xe2\x80\x94I worshipped a woman once, and believed she could\r\ncare for me; and then I took a helpless child and fostered him; and I\r\nwatched him as he grew, to see if he would care for me only a\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94care for _me_ over and above the good he got from me. I would\r\nhave torn open my breast to warm him with my life-blood if I could only\r\nhave seen him care a little for the pain of my wound. I have laboured,\r\nI have strained to crush out of this hard life one drop of unselfish\r\nlove. Fool! men love their own delights; there is no delight to be had\r\nin me. And yet I watched till I believed I saw what I watched for. When\r\nhe was a child he lifted soft eyes towards me, and held my hand\r\nwillingly: I thought, this boy will surely love me a little: because I\r\ngive my life to him and strive that he shall know no sorrow, he will\r\ncare a little when I am thirsty\xe2\x80\x94the drop he lays on my parched lips\r\nwill be a joy to him... Curses on him! I wish I may see him lie with\r\nthose red lips white and dry as ashes, and when he looks for pity I\r\nwish he may see my face rejoicing in his pain. It is all a lie\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nworld is a lie\xe2\x80\x94there is no goodness but in hate. Fool! not one drop of\r\nlove came with all your striving: life has not given you one drop. But\r\nthere are deep draughts in this world for hatred and revenge. I have\r\nmemory left for that, and there is strength in my arm\xe2\x80\x94there is strength\r\nin my will\xe2\x80\x94and if I can do nothing but kill him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s mind rejected the thought of that brief punishment.\r\nHis whole soul had been thrilled into immediate unreasoning belief in\r\nthat eternity of vengeance where he, an undying hate, might clutch for\r\never an undying traitor, and hear that fair smiling hardness cry and\r\nmoan with anguish. But the primary need and hope was to see a slow\r\nrevenge under the same sky and on the same earth where he himself had\r\nbeen forsaken and had fainted with despair. And as soon as he tried to\r\nconcentrate his mind on the means of attaining his end, the sense of\r\nhis weakness pressed upon him like a frosty ache. This despised body,\r\nwhich was to be the instrument of a sublime vengeance, must be\r\nnourished and decently clad. If he had to wait he must labour, and his\r\nlabour must be of a humble sort, for he had no skill. He wondered\r\nwhether the sight of written characters would so stimulate his\r\nfaculties that he might venture to try and find work as a copyist:\r\n_that_ might win him some credence for his past scholarship. But no! he\r\ndared trust neither hand nor brain. He must be content to do the work\r\nthat was most like that of a beast of burden: in this mercantile city\r\nmany porters must be wanted, and he could at least carry weights.\r\nThanks to the justice that struggled in this confused world in behalf\r\nof vengeance, his limbs had got back some of their old sturdiness. He\r\nwas stripped of all else that men would give coin for.\r\n\r\nBut the new urgency of this habitual thought brought a new suggestion.\r\nThere was something hanging by a cord round his bare neck; something\r\napparently so paltry that the piety of Turks and Frenchmen had spared\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94a tiny parchment bag blackened with age. It had hung round his neck\r\nas a precious charm when he was a boy, and he had kept it carefully on\r\nhis breast, not believing that it contained anything but a tiny scroll\r\nof parchment rolled up hard. He might long ago have thrown it away as a\r\nrelic of his dead mother\xe2\x80\x99s superstition; but he had thought of it as a\r\nrelic of her love, and had kept it. It was part of the piety associated\r\nwith such _brevi_, that they should never be opened, and at any\r\nprevious moment in his life Baldassarre would have said that no sort of\r\nthirst would prevail upon him to open this little bag for the chance of\r\nfinding that it contained, not parchment, but an engraved amulet which\r\nwould be worth money. But now a thirst had come like that which makes\r\nmen open their own veins to satisfy it, and the thought of the possible\r\namulet no sooner crossed Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s mind than with nervous fingers\r\nhe snatched the _breve_ from his neck. It all rushed through his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94the long years he had worn it, the far-off sunny balcony at Naples\r\nlooking towards the blue waters, where he had leaned against his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s knee; but it made no moment of hesitation: all piety now was\r\ntransmuted into a just revenge. He bit and tore till the doubles of\r\nparchment were laid open, and then\xe2\x80\x94it was a sight that made him\r\npant\xe2\x80\x94there _was_ an amulet. It was very small, but it was as blue as\r\nthose far-off waters; it was an engraved sapphire, which must be worth\r\nsome gold ducats. Baldassarre no sooner saw those possible ducats than\r\nhe saw some of them exchanged for a poniard. He did not want to use the\r\nponiard yet, but he longed to possess it. If he could grasp its handle\r\nand try its edge, that blank in his mind\xe2\x80\x94that past which fell away\r\ncontinually\xe2\x80\x94would not make him feel so cruelly helpless: the sharp\r\nsteel that despised talents and eluded strength would be at his side,\r\nas the unfailing friend of feeble justice. There was a sparkling\r\ntriumph under Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s black eyebrows as he replaced the little\r\nsapphire inside the bits of parchment and wound the string tightly\r\nround them.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dusk now, and he rose to walk back towards Florence. With\r\nhis _danari_ to buy him some bread, he felt rich: he could lie out in\r\nthe open air, as he found plenty more doing in all corners of Florence.\r\nAnd in the next few days he had sold his sapphire, had added to his\r\nclothing, had bought a bright dagger, and had still a pair of gold\r\nflorins left. But he meant to hoard that treasure carefully: his\r\nlodging was an outhouse with a heap of straw in it, in a thinly\r\ninhabited part of Oltrarno, and he thought of looking about for work as\r\na porter.\r\n\r\nHe had bought his dagger at Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s. Paying his meditated visit there\r\none evening at dusk, he had found that singular rag-merchant just\r\nreturned from one of his rounds, emptying out his basketful of broken\r\nglass and old iron amongst his handsome show of miscellaneous\r\nsecond-hand goods. As Baldassarre entered the shop, and looked towards\r\nthe smart pieces of apparel, the musical instruments, and weapons,\r\nwhich were displayed in the broadest light of the window, his eye at\r\nonce singled out a dagger hanging up high against a red scarf. By\r\nbuying the dagger he could not only satisfy a strong desire, he could\r\nopen his original errand in a more indirect manner than by speaking of\r\nthe onyx ring. In the course of bargaining for the weapon, he let drop,\r\nwith cautious carelessness, that he came from Genoa, and had been\r\ndirected to Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s shop by an acquaintance in that city who had\r\nbought a very valuable ring here. Had the respectable trader any more\r\nsuch rings?\r\n\r\nWhereupon Bratti had much to say as to the unlikelihood of such rings\r\nbeing within reach of many people, with much vaunting of his own rare\r\nconnections, due to his known wisdom, and honesty. It might be true\r\nthat he was a pedlar\xe2\x80\x94he chose to be a pedlar; though he was rich enough\r\nto kick his heels in his shop all day. But those who thought they had\r\nsaid all there was to be said about Bratti when they had called him a\r\npedlar, were a good deal further off the truth than the other side of\r\nPisa. How was it that he could put that ring in a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s way? It\r\nwas, because he had a very particular knowledge of a handsome young\r\nsignor, who did not look quite so fine a feathered bird when Bratti\r\nfirst set eyes on him as he did at the present time. And by a question\r\nor two Baldassarre extracted, without any trouble, such a rough and\r\nrambling account of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s life as the pedlar could give, since the\r\ntime when he had found him sleeping under the Loggia de\xe2\x80\x99 Cerchi. It\r\nnever occurred to Bratti that the decent man (who was rather deaf,\r\napparently, asking him to say many things twice over) had any curiosity\r\nabout Tito; the curiosity was doubtless about himself, as a truly\r\nremarkable pedlar.\r\n\r\nAnd Baldassarre left Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s shop, not only with the dagger at his\r\nside, but also with a general knowledge of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and\r\nposition\xe2\x80\x94of his early sale of the jewels, his immediate quiet\r\nsettlement of himself at Florence, his marriage, and his great\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat story had he told about his previous life\xe2\x80\x94about his father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for Baldassarre to discover the answer to that\r\nquestion. Meanwhile, he wanted to learn all he could about Florence.\r\nBut he found, to his acute distress, that of the new details he learned\r\nhe could only retain a few, and those only by continual repetition; and\r\nhe began to be afraid of listening to any new discourse, lest it should\r\nobliterate what he was already striving to remember.\r\n\r\nThe day he was discerned by Tito in the Piazza del Duomo, he had the\r\nfresh anguish of this consciousness in his mind, and Tito\xe2\x80\x99s ready\r\nspeech fell upon him like the mockery of a glib, defying demon.\r\n\r\nAs he went home to his heap of straw, and passed by the booksellers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshops in the Via del Garbo, he paused to look at the volumes spread\r\nopen. Could he by long gazing at one of those books lay hold of the\r\nslippery threads of memory? Could he, by striving, get a firm grasp\r\nsomewhere, and lift himself above these waters that flowed over him?\r\n\r\nHe was tempted, and bought the cheapest Greek book he could see. He\r\ncarried it home and sat on his heap of straw, looking at the characters\r\nby the light of the small window; but no inward light arose on them.\r\nSoon the evening darkness came; but it made little difference to\r\nBaldassarre. His strained eyes seemed still to see the white pages with\r\nthe unintelligible black marks upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nFruit is Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, the second morning after he had made his speech\r\nin the Piazza del Duomo, \xe2\x80\x9cI am to receive grand visitors to-day; the\r\nMilanese Count is coming again, and the Seneschal de Beaucaire, the\r\ngreat favourite of the Cristianissimo. I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t care to go\r\nthrough smiling ceremonies with these rustling magnates, whom we are\r\nnot likely to see again; and as they will want to look at the\r\nantiquities and the library, perhaps you had better give up your work\r\nto-day, and go to see your cousin Brigida.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola discerned a wish in this intimation, and immediately assented.\r\nBut presently, coming back in her hood and mantle, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what\r\na long breath Florence will take when the gates are flung open, and the\r\nlast Frenchman is walking out of them! Even you are getting tired, with\r\nall your patience, my Tito; confess it. Ah, your head is hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was leaning over his desk, writing, and she had laid her hand on his\r\nhead, meaning to give a parting caress. The attitude had been a\r\nfrequent one, and Tito was accustomed, when he felt her hand there, to\r\nraise his head, throw himself a little backward, and look up at her.\r\nBut he felt now as unable to raise his head as if her hand had been a\r\nleaden cowl. He spoke instead, in a light tone, as his pen still ran\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe French are as ready to go from Florence as the wasps to leave a\r\nripe pear when they have just fastened on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola, keenly sensitive to the absence of the usual response, took\r\naway her hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going, Tito.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, my sweet one. I must wait at home. Take Maso with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Tito did not look up, and Romola went out without saying any\r\nmore. Very slight things make epochs in married life, and this morning\r\nfor the first time she admitted to herself not only that Tito had\r\nchanged, but that he had changed towards her. Did the reason lie in\r\nherself? She might perhaps have thought so, if there had not been the\r\nfacts of the armour and the picture to suggest some external event\r\nwhich was an entire mystery to her.\r\n\r\nBut Tito no sooner believed that Romola was out of the house than he\r\nlaid down his pen and looked up, in delightful security from seeing\r\nanything else than parchment and broken marble. He was rather disgusted\r\nwith himself that he had not been able to look up at Romola and behave\r\nto her just as usual. He would have chosen, if he could, to be even\r\nmore than usually kind; but he could not, on a sudden, master an\r\ninvoluntary shrinking from her, which, by a subtle relation, depended\r\non those very characteristics in him that made him desire not to fail\r\nin his marks of affection. He was about to take a step which he knew\r\nwould arouse her deep indignation; he would have to encounter much that\r\nwas unpleasant before he could win her forgiveness. And Tito could\r\nnever find it easy to face displeasure and anger; his nature was one of\r\nthose most remote from defiance or impudence, and all his inclinations\r\nleaned towards preserving Romola\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness. He was not tormented by\r\nsentimental scruples which, as he had demonstrated to himself by a very\r\nrapid course of argument, had no relation to solid utility; but his\r\nfreedom from scruples did not release him from the dread of what was\r\ndisagreeable. Unscrupulousness gets rid of much, but not of toothache,\r\nor wounded vanity, or the sense of loneliness, against which, as the\r\nworld at present stands, there is no security but a thoroughly healthy\r\njaw, and a just, loving soul. And Tito was feeling intensely at this\r\nmoment that no devices could save him from pain in the impending\r\ncollision with Romola; no persuasive blandness could cushion him\r\nagainst the shock towards which he was being driven like a timid animal\r\nurged to a desperate leap by the terror of the tooth and the claw that\r\nare close behind it.\r\n\r\nThe secret feeling he had previously had that the tenacious adherence\r\nto Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s wishes about the library had become under existing\r\ndifficulties a piece of sentimental folly, which deprived himself and\r\nRomola of substantial advantages, might perhaps never have wrought\r\nitself into action but for the events of the past week, which had\r\nbrought at once the pressure of a new motive and the outlet of a rare\r\nopportunity. Nay, it was not till his dread had been aggravated by the\r\nsight of Baldassarre looking more like his sane self, not until he had\r\nbegun to feel that he might be compelled to flee from Florence, that he\r\nhad brought himself to resolve on using his legal right to sell the\r\nlibrary before the great opportunity offered by French and Milanese\r\nbidders slipped through his fingers. For if he had to leave Florence he\r\ndid not want to leave it as a destitute wanderer. He had been used to\r\nan agreeable existence, and he wished to carry with him all the means\r\nat hand for retaining the same agreeable conditions. He wished among\r\nother things to carry Romola with him, and _not_, if possible, to carry\r\nany infamy. Success had given him a growing appetite for all the\r\npleasures that depend on an advantageous social position, and at no\r\nmoment could it look like a temptation to him, but only like a hideous\r\nalternative, to decamp under dishonour, even with a bag of diamonds,\r\nand incur the life of an adventurer. It was not possible for him to\r\nmake himself independent even of those Florentines who only greeted him\r\nwith regard; still less was it possible for him to make himself\r\nindependent of Romola. She was the wife of his first love\xe2\x80\x94he loved her\r\nstill; she belonged to that furniture of life which he shrank from\r\nparting with. He winced under her judgment, he felt uncertain how far\r\nthe revulsion of her feeling towards him might go; and all that sense\r\nof power over a wife which makes a husband risk betrayals that a lover\r\nnever ventures on, would not suffice to counteract Tito\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness.\r\nThis was the leaden weight which had been too strong for his will, and\r\nkept him from raising his head to meet her eyes. Their pure light\r\nbrought too near him the prospect of a coming struggle. But it was not\r\nto be helped; if they had to leave Florence, they must have money;\r\nindeed, Tito could not arrange life at all to his mind without a\r\nconsiderable sum of money. And that problem of arranging life to his\r\nmind had been the source of all his misdoing. He would have been equal\r\nto any sacrifice that was not unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe rustling magnates came and went, the bargains had been concluded,\r\nand Romola returned home; but nothing grave was said that night. Tito\r\nwas only gay and chatty, pouring forth to her, as he had not done\r\nbefore, stories and descriptions of what he had witnessed during the\r\nFrench visit. Romola thought she discerned an effort in his liveliness,\r\nand attributing it to the consciousness in him that she had been\r\nwounded in the morning, accepted the effort as an act of penitence,\r\ninwardly aching a little at that sign of growing distance between\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94that there was an offence about which neither of them dared to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThe next day Tito remained away from home until late at night. It was a\r\nmarked day to Romola, for Piero di Cosimo, stimulated to greater\r\nindustry on her behalf by the fear that he might have been the cause of\r\npain to her in the past week, had sent home her father\xe2\x80\x99s portrait. She\r\nhad propped it against the back of his old chair, and had been looking\r\nat it for some time, when the door opened behind her, and Bernardo del\r\nNero came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is you, godfather! How I wish you had come sooner! it is getting a\r\nlittle dusk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, going towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just looked in to tell you the good news, for I know Tito has\r\nnot come yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo. \xe2\x80\x9cThe French king moves off to-morrow: not\r\nbefore it is high time. There has been another tussle between our\r\npeople and his soldiers this morning. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance now of the\r\ncity getting into order once more and trade going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is joyful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is sudden, is it not? Tito\r\nseemed to think yesterday that there was little prospect of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been well barked at, that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo,\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x9cHis own generals opened their throats pretty well, and at\r\nlast our Signoria sent the mastiff of the city, Fra Girolamo. The\r\nCristianissimo was frightened at that thunder, and has given the order\r\nto move. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid there\xe2\x80\x99ll be small agreement among us when he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone, but, at any rate, all parties are agreed in being glad not to\r\nhave Florence stifled with soldiery any longer, and the Frate has\r\nbarked this time to some purpose. Ah, what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as\r\nRomola, clasping him by the arm, led him in front of the picture. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nus see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to unwind his long scarf while she placed a seat for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want your spectacles, godfather?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in anxiety\r\nthat he should see just what she saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, child, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, uncovering his grey head, as he seated\r\nhimself with firm erectness. \xe2\x80\x9cFor seeing at this distance, my old eyes\r\nare perhaps better than your young ones. Old men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are like old\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s memories; they are strongest for things a long way off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better than having no portrait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, apologetically,\r\nafter Bernardo had been silent a little while. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is less like him now\r\nthan the image I have in my mind, but then that might fade with the\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d She rested her arm on the old man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder as she spoke,\r\ndrawn towards him strongly by their common interest in the dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost think I see Bardo as he was\r\nwhen he was young, better than that picture shows him to me as he was\r\nwhen he was old. Your father had a great deal of fire in his eyes when\r\nhe was young. It was what I could never understand, that he, with his\r\nfiery spirit, which seemed much more impatient than mine, could hang\r\nover the books and live with shadows all his life. However, he had put\r\nhis heart into that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBernardo gave a slight shrug as he spoke the last words, but Romola\r\ndiscerned in his voice a feeling that accorded with her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was disappointed to the last,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, involuntarily. But\r\nimmediately fearing lest her words should be taken to imply an\r\naccusation against Tito, she went on almost hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we could\r\nonly see his longest, dearest wish fulfilled just to his mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so we may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, kindly, rising and putting on his\r\ncap. \xe2\x80\x9cThe times are cloudy now, but fish are caught by waiting. Who\r\nknows? When the wheel has turned often enough, I may be Gonfaloniere\r\nyet before I die; and no creditor can touch these things.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked\r\nround as he spoke. Then, turning to her, and patting her cheek, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you need not be afraid of my dying; my ghost will claim nothing.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken care of that in my will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola seized the hand that was against her cheek, and put it to her\r\nlips in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you been scolding your husband for keeping away from home so\r\nmuch lately? I see him everywhere but here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, willing to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\nShe felt the flush spread over her neck and face as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\nbeen very much wanted; you know he speaks so well. I am glad to know\r\nthat his value is understood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are contented then, Madonna Orgogliosa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, smiling,\r\nas he moved to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Romola! There was one thing that would have made the pang of\r\ndisappointment in her husband harder to bear; it was, that any one\r\nshould know he gave her cause for disappointment. This might be a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, but it is closely allied to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s nobleness. She\r\nwho willingly lifts up the veil of her married life has profaned it\r\nfrom a sanctuary into a vulgar place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nA Revelation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Romola, like every other Florentine, was excited about the\r\ndeparture of the French. Besides her other reasons for gladness, she\r\nhad a dim hope, which she was conscious was half superstitious, that\r\nthose new anxieties about Tito, having come with the burdensome guests,\r\nmight perhaps vanish with them. The French had been in Florence hardly\r\neleven days, but in that space she had felt more acute unhappiness than\r\nshe had known in her life before. Tito had adopted the hateful armour\r\non the day of their arrival, and though she could frame no distinct\r\nnotion why their departure should remove the cause of his fear\xe2\x80\x94though,\r\nwhen she thought of that cause, the image of the prisoner grasping him,\r\nas she had seen it in Piero\xe2\x80\x99s sketch, urged itself before her and\r\nexcluded every other\xe2\x80\x94still, when the French were gone, she would be rid\r\nof something that was strongly associated with her pain.\r\n\r\nWrapped in her mantle she waited under the loggia at the top of the\r\nhouse, and watched for the glimpses of the troops and the royal retinue\r\npassing the bridges on their way to the Porta San Piero, that looks\r\ntowards Siena and Rome. She even returned to her station when the gates\r\nhad been closed, that she might feel herself vibrating with the great\r\npeal of the bells. It was dusk then, and when at last she descended\r\ninto the library, she lit her lamp with the resolution that she would\r\novercome the agitation which had made her idle all day, and sit down to\r\nwork at her copying of the catalogue. Tito had left home early in the\r\nmorning, and she did not expect him yet. Before he came she intended to\r\nleave the library, and sit in the pretty saloon, with the dancing\r\nnymphs and the birds. She had done so every evening since he had\r\nobjected to the library as chill and gloomy.\r\n\r\nTo her great surprise, she had not been at work long before Tito\r\nentered. Her first thought was, how cheerless he would feel in the wide\r\ndarkness of this great room, with one little oil-lamp burning at the\r\nfurther end, and the fire nearly out. She almost ran towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, dearest, I did not know you would come so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nnervously, putting up her white arms to unwind his becchetto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not welcome then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with one of his brightest smiles,\r\nclasping her, but playfully holding his head back from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito!\xe2\x80\x9d She uttered the word in a tone of pretty, loving reproach, and\r\nthen he kissed her fondly, stroked her hair, as his manner was, and\r\nseemed not to mind about taking off his mantle yet. Romola quivered\r\nwith delight. All the emotions of the day had been preparing in her a\r\nkeener sensitiveness to the return of this habitual manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\r\ncome back,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old happiness will perhaps\r\ncome back. He is like himself again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito was taking great pains to be like himself; his heart was\r\npalpitating with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had expected you so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, as she at last helped him\r\nto take off his wrappings, \xe2\x80\x9cI would have had a little festival prepared\r\nto this joyful ringing of the bells. I did not mean to be here in the\r\nlibrary when you came home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not think about the fire.\r\nCome\xe2\x80\x94come and sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a low stool against Tito\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and that was Romola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhabitual seat when they were talking together. She rested her arm on\r\nhis knee, as she used to do on her father\xe2\x80\x99s, and looked up at him while\r\nhe spoke. He had never yet noticed the presence of the portrait, and\r\nshe had not mentioned it\xe2\x80\x94thinking of it all the more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been enjoying the clang of the bells for the first time, Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe began. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked being shaken and deafened by them: I fancied I was\r\nsomething like a Bacchante possessed by a divine rage. Are not the\r\npeople looking very joyful to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoyful after a sour and pious fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nin truth, those who are left behind in Florence have little cause to be\r\njoyful: it seems to me, the most reasonable ground of gladness would be\r\nto have got out of Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito had sounded the desired key-note without any trouble, or\r\nappearance of premeditation. He spoke with no emphasis, but he looked\r\ngrave enough to make Romola ask rather anxiously\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tito? Are there fresh troubles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need of fresh ones, my Romola. There are three strong parties in\r\nthe city, all ready to fly at each other\xe2\x80\x99s throats. And if the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparty is strong enough to frighten the other two into silence, as seems\r\nmost likely, life will be as pleasant and amusing as a funeral. They\r\nhave the plan of a Great Council simmering already; and if they get it,\r\nthe man who sings sacred Lauds the loudest will be the most eligible\r\nfor office. And besides that, the city will be so drained by the\r\npayment of this great subsidy to the French king, and by the war to get\r\nback Pisa, that the prospect would be dismal enough without the rule of\r\nfanatics. On the whole, Florence will be a delightful place for those\r\nworthies who entertain themselves in the evening by going into crypts\r\nand lashing themselves; but for everything else, the exiles have the\r\nbest of it. For my own part, I have been thinking seriously that we\r\nshould be wise to quit Florence, my Romola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started. \xe2\x80\x9cTito, how could we leave Florence? Surely you do not\r\nthink I could leave it\xe2\x80\x94at least, not yet\xe2\x80\x94not for a long while.\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\nturned cold and trembling, and did not find it quite easy to speak.\r\nTito must know the reasons she had in her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all a fabric of your own imagination, my sweet one. Your\r\nsecluded life has made you lay such false stress on a few things. You\r\nknow I used to tell you, before we were married, that I wished we were\r\nsomewhere else than in Florence. If you had seen more places and more\r\npeople, you would know what I mean when I say that there is something\r\nin the Florentines that reminds me of their cutting spring winds. I\r\nlike people who take life less eagerly; and it would be good for my\r\nRomola, too, to see a new life. I should like to dip her a little in\r\nthe soft waters of forgetfulness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and kissed her brow, and laid his hand on her fair\r\nhair again; but she felt his caress no more than if he had kissed a\r\nmask. She was too much agitated by the sense of the distance between\r\ntheir minds to be conscious that his lips touched her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, it is not because I suppose Florence is the pleasantest place in\r\nthe world that I desire not to quit it. It is because I\xe2\x80\x94because we have\r\nto see my father\xe2\x80\x99s wish fulfilled. My godfather is old; he is\r\nseventy-one; we could not leave it to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is precisely those superstitions which hang about your mind like\r\nbedimming clouds, my Romola, that make one great reason why I could\r\nwish we were two hundred leagues from Florence. I am obliged to take\r\ncare of you in opposition to your own will: if those dear eyes, that\r\nlook so tender, see falsely, I must see for them, and save my wife from\r\nwasting her life in disappointing herself by impracticable dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola sat silent and motionless: she could not blind herself to the\r\ndirection in which Tito\xe2\x80\x99s words pointed: he wanted to persuade her that\r\nthey might get the library deposited in some monastery, or take some\r\nother ready means to rid themselves of a task, and of a tie to\r\nFlorence; and she was determined never to submit her mind to his\r\njudgment on this question of duty to her father; she was inwardly\r\nprepared to encounter any sort of pain in resistance. But the\r\ndetermination was kept latent in these first moments by the\r\nheart-crushing sense that now at last she and Tito must be confessedly\r\ndivided in their wishes. He was glad of her silence; for, much as he\r\nhad feared the strength of her feeling, it was impossible for him, shut\r\nup in the narrowness that hedges in all merely clever, unimpassioned\r\nmen, not to over-estimate the persuasiveness of his own arguments. His\r\nconduct did not look ugly to himself, and his imagination did not\r\nsuffice to show him exactly how it would look to Romola. He went on in\r\nthe same gentle, remonstrating tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, dearest\xe2\x80\x94your own clear judgment always showed you\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\nnotion of isolating a collection of books and antiquities, and\r\nattaching a single name to them for ever, was one that had no valid,\r\nsubstantial good for its object: and yet more, one that was liable to\r\nbe defeated in a thousand ways. See what has become of the Medici\r\ncollections! And, for my part, I consider it even blameworthy to\r\nentertain those petty views of appropriation: why should any one be\r\nreasonably glad that Florence should possess the benefits of learned\r\nresearch and taste more than any other city? I understand your feeling\r\nabout the wishes of the dead; but wisdom puts a limit to these\r\nsentiments, else lives might be continually wasted in that sort of\r\nfutile devotion\xe2\x80\x94like praising deaf gods for ever. You gave your life to\r\nyour father while he lived; why should you demand more of yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it was a trust,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in a low but distinct voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ntrusted me, he trusted you, Tito. I did not expect you to feel anything\r\nelse about it\xe2\x80\x94to feel as I do\xe2\x80\x94but I did expect you to feel that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dearest, of course I should feel it on a point where your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s real welfare or happiness was concerned; but there is no\r\nquestion of that now. If we believed in purgatory, I should be as\r\nanxious as you to have masses said; and if I believed it could now pain\r\nyour father to see his library preserved and used in a rather different\r\nway from what he had set his mind on, I should share the strictness of\r\nyour views. But a little philosophy should teach us to rid ourselves of\r\nthose air-woven fetters that mortals hang round themselves, spending\r\ntheir lives in misery under the mere imagination of weight. Your mind,\r\nwhich seizes ideas so readily, my Romola, is able to discriminate\r\nbetween substantial good and these brain-wrought fantasies. Ask\r\nyourself, dearest, what possible good can these books and antiquities\r\ndo, stowed together under your father\xe2\x80\x99s name in Florence, more than\r\nthey would do if they were divided or carried elsewhere? Nay, is not\r\nthe very dispersion of such things in hands that know how to value\r\nthem, one means of extending their usefulness? This rivalry of Italian\r\ncities is very petty and illiberal. The loss of Constantinople was the\r\ngain of the whole civilised world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola was still too thoroughly under the painful pressure of the new\r\nrevelation Tito was making of himself, for her resistance to find any\r\nstrong vent. As that fluent talk fell on her ears there was a rising\r\ncontempt within her, which only made her more conscious of her bruised,\r\ndespairing love, her love for the Tito she had married and believed in.\r\nHer nature, possessed with the energies of strong emotion, recoiled\r\nfrom this hopelessly shallow readiness which professed to appropriate\r\nthe widest sympathies and had no pulse for the nearest. She still spoke\r\nlike one who was restrained from showing all she felt. She had only\r\ndrawn away her arm from his knee, and sat with her hands clasped before\r\nher, cold and motionless as locked waters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk of substantial good, Tito! Are faithfulness, and love, and\r\nsweet grateful memories, no good? Is it no good that we should keep our\r\nsilent promises on which others build because they believe in our love\r\nand truth? Is it no good that a just life should be justly honoured?\r\nOr, is it good that we should harden our hearts against all the wants\r\nand hopes of those who have depended on us? What good can belong to men\r\nwho have such souls? To talk cleverly, perhaps, and find soft couches\r\nfor themselves, and live and die with their base selves as their best\r\ncompanions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice had gradually risen till there was a ring of scorn in the\r\nlast words; she made a slight pause, but he saw there were other words\r\nquivering on her lips, and he chose to let them come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know of no good for cities or the world if they are to be made up of\r\nsuch beings. But I am not thinking of other Italian cities and the\r\nwhole civilised world\xe2\x80\x94I am thinking of my father, and of my love and\r\nsorrow for him, and of his just claims on us. I would give up anything\r\nelse, Tito,\xe2\x80\x94I would leave Florence,\xe2\x80\x94what else did I live for but for\r\nhim and you? But I will not give up that duty. What have I to do with\r\nyour arguments? It was a yearning of _his_ heart, and therefore it is a\r\nyearning of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice, from having been tremulous, had become full and firm. She\r\nfelt that she had been urged on to say all that it was needful for her\r\nto say. She thought, poor thing, there was nothing harder to come than\r\nthis struggle against Tito\xe2\x80\x99s suggestions as against the meaner part of\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHe had begun to see clearly that he could not persuade her into assent:\r\nhe must take another course, and show her that the time for resistance\r\nwas past. That, at least, would put an end to further struggle; and if\r\nthe disclosure were not made by himself to-night, to-morrow it must be\r\nmade in another way. This necessity nerved his courage; and his\r\nexperience of her affectionateness and unexpected submissiveness, ever\r\nsince their marriage until now, encouraged him to hope that, at last,\r\nshe would accommodate herself to what had been his will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear you speak in that spirit of blind persistence, my\r\nRomola,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it obliges me to give you pain. But\r\nI partly foresaw your opposition, and as a prompt decision was\r\nnecessary, I avoided that obstacle, and decided without consulting you.\r\nThe very care of a husband for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s interest compels him to that\r\nseparate action sometimes\xe2\x80\x94even when he has such a wife as you, my\r\nRomola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes on him in breathless inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, answering her look, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have arranged for the\r\ntransfer, both of the books and of the antiquities, where they will\r\nfind the highest use and value. The books have been bought for the Duke\r\nof Milan, the marbles and bronzes and the rest are going to France: and\r\nboth will be protected by the stability of a great Power, instead of\r\nremaining in a city which is exposed to ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished speaking, Romola had started from her seat, and\r\nstood up looking down at him, with tightened hands falling before her,\r\nand, for the first time in her life, with a flash of fierceness in her\r\nscorn and anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have _sold_ them?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as if she distrusted her ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, quailing a little. The scene was unpleasant\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndescending scorn already scorched him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a treacherous man!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with something grating in her\r\nvoice, as she looked down at him.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a minute, and he sat still, feeling that ingenuity\r\nwas powerless just now. Suddenly she turned away, and said in an\r\nagitated tone, \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be hindered\xe2\x80\x94I am going to my godfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant Tito started up, went to the door, locked it, and took\r\nout the key. It was time for all the masculine predominance that was\r\nlatent in him to show itself. But he was not angry; he only felt that\r\nthe moment was eminently unpleasant, and that when this scene was at an\r\nend he should be glad to keep away from Romola for a little while. But\r\nit was absolutely necessary first that she should be reduced to\r\npassiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to calm yourself a little, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, leaning in the\r\neasiest attitude possible against a pedestal under the bust of a grim\r\nold Roman. Not that he was inwardly easy: his heart palpitated with a\r\nmoral dread, against which no chain-armour could be found. He had\r\nlocked in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s anger and scorn, but he had been obliged to lock\r\nhimself in with it; and his blood did not rise with contest\xe2\x80\x94his olive\r\ncheek was perceptibly paled.\r\n\r\nRomola had paused and turned her eyes on him as she saw him take his\r\nstand and lodge the key in his scarsella. Her eyes were flashing, and\r\nher whole frame seemed to be possessed by impetuous force that wanted\r\nto leap out in some deed. All the crushing pain of disappointment in\r\nher husband, which had made the strongest part of her consciousness a\r\nfew minutes before, was annihilated by the vehemence of her\r\nindignation. She could not care in this moment that the man she was\r\ndespising as he leaned there in his loathsome beauty\xe2\x80\x94she could not care\r\nthat he was her husband; she could only feel that she despised him. The\r\npride and fierceness of the old Bardo blood had been thoroughly awaked\r\nin her for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry at least to understand the fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cand do not seek to\r\ntake futile steps which may be fatal. It is of no use for you to go to\r\nyour godfather. Messer Bernardo cannot reverse what I have done. Only\r\nsit down. You would hardly wish, if you were quite yourself, to make\r\nknown to any third person what passes between us in private.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito knew that he had touched the right fibre there. But she did not\r\nsit down; she was too unconscious of her body voluntarily to change her\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can it not be reversed?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is\r\nmoved yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply because the sale has been concluded by written agreement; the\r\npurchasers have left Florence, and I hold the bonds for the\r\npurchase-money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my father had suspected you of being a faithless man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nin a tone of bitter scorn, which insisted on darting out before she\r\ncould say anything else, \xe2\x80\x9che would have placed the library safely out\r\nof your power. But death overtook him too soon, and when you were sure\r\nhis ear was deaf, and his hand stiff, you robbed him.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused an\r\ninstant, and then said, with gathered passion, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you robbed\r\nsomebody else, who is _not_ dead? Is that the reason you wear armour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola had been driven to utter the words as men are driven to use the\r\nlash of the horsewhip. At first, Tito felt horribly cowed; it seemed to\r\nhim that the disgrace he had been dreading would be worse than he had\r\nimagined it. But soon there was a reaction: such power of dislike and\r\nresistance as there was within him was beginning to rise against a wife\r\nwhose voice seemed like the herald of a retributive fate. Her, at\r\nleast, his quick mind told him that he might master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cto answer the words of madness,\r\nRomola. Your peculiar feeling about your father has made you mad at\r\nthis moment. Any rational person looking at the case from a due\r\ndistance will see that I have taken the wisest course. Apart from the\r\ninfluence of your exaggerated feelings on him, I am convinced that\r\nMesser Bernardo would be of that opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cHe lives in the hope of seeing my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s wish exactly fulfilled. We spoke of it together only\r\nyesterday. He will help me yet. Who are these men to whom you have sold\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason why you should not be told, except that it\r\nsignifies little. The Count di San Severino and the Seneschal de\r\nBeaucaire are now on their way with the king to Siena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may be overtaken and persuaded to give up their purchase,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRomola, eagerly, her anger beginning to be surmounted by anxious\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they may not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with cool decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I do not choose that they should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you were paid the money?\xe2\x80\x94we will pay you the money,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRomola.\r\n\r\nNo words could have disclosed more fully her sense of alienation from\r\nTito; but they were spoken with less of bitterness than of anxious\r\npleading. And he felt stronger, for he saw that the first impulse of\r\nfury was past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my Romola. Understand that such thoughts as these are\r\nimpracticable. You would not, in a reasonable moment, ask your\r\ngodfather to bury three thousand florins in addition to what he has\r\nalready paid on the library. I think your pride and delicacy would\r\nshrink from that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to tremble and turn cold again with discouragement, and sank\r\ndown on the carved chest near which she was standing. He went on in a\r\nclear voice, under which she shuddered, as if it had been a narrow cold\r\nstream coursing over a hot cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, it is not my will that Messer Bernardo should advance the\r\nmoney, even if the project were not an utterly wild one. And I beg you\r\nto consider, before you take any step or utter any word on the subject,\r\nwhat will be the consequences of your placing yourself in opposition to\r\nme, and trying to exhibit your husband in the odious light which your\r\nown distempered feelings cast over him. What object will you serve by\r\ninjuring me with Messer Bernardo? The event is irrevocable, the library\r\nis sold, and you are my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery word was spoken for the sake of a calculated effect, for his\r\nintellect was urged into the utmost activity by the danger of the\r\ncrisis. He knew that Romola\xe2\x80\x99s mind would take in rapidly enough all the\r\nwide meaning of his speech. He waited and watched her in silence.\r\n\r\nShe had turned her eyes from him, and was looking on the ground, and in\r\nthat way she sat for several minutes. When she spoke, her voice was\r\nquite altered,\xe2\x80\x94it was quiet and cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have one thing to ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk anything that I can do without injuring us both, Romola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you will give me that portion of the money which belongs to my\r\ngodfather, and let me pay him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have some assurance from you, first, of the attitude you intend\r\nto take towards me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in assurances, Tito?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a tinge of\r\nreturning bitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom you, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do you no harm. I shall disclose nothing. I will say nothing to\r\npain him or you. You say truly, the event is irrevocable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will do what you desire to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night, if possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we may not speak of it\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, moving towards the lamp, while she sat\r\nstill, looking away from him with absent eyes.\r\n\r\nPresently he came and bent down over her, to put a piece of paper into\r\nher hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will receive something in return, you are aware, my\r\nRomola?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gently, not minding so much what had passed, now he\r\nwas secure; and feeling able to try and propitiate her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking the paper, without looking at him, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will forgive me, my Romola, when you have had time to\r\nreflect.\xe2\x80\x9d He just touched her brow with his lips, but she took no\r\nnotice, and seemed really unconscious of the act. She was aware that he\r\nunlocked the door and went out. She moved her head and listened. The\r\ngreat door of the court opened and shut again. She started up as if\r\nsome sudden freedom had come, and going to her father\xe2\x80\x99s chair where his\r\npicture was propped, fell on her knees before it, and burst into sobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nBaldassarre makes an Acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Baldassarre was wandering about Florence in search of a spare\r\nouthouse where he might have the cheapest of sheltered beds, his steps\r\nhad been attracted towards that sole portion of ground within the walls\r\nof the city which is not perfectly level, and where the spectator,\r\nlifted above the roofs of the houses, can see beyond the city to the\r\nprotecting hills and far-stretching valley, otherwise shut out from his\r\nview except along the welcome opening made by the course of the Arno.\r\nPart of that ground has been already seen by us as the hill of Bogoli,\r\nat that time a great stone-quarry; but the side towards which\r\nBaldassarre directed his steps was the one that sloped down behind the\r\nVia de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and was most commonly called the hill of San Giorgio.\r\nBratti had told him that Tito\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling was in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi; and,\r\nafter surveying that street, he turned up the slope of the hill which\r\nhe had observed as he was crossing the bridge. If he could find a\r\nsheltering outhouse on that hill, he would be glad: he had now for some\r\nyears been accustomed to live with a broad sky about him; and,\r\nmoreover, the narrow passes of the streets, with their strip of sky\r\nabove, and the unknown labyrinth around them, seemed to intensify his\r\nsense of loneliness and feeble memory.\r\n\r\nThe hill was sparsely inhabited, and covered chiefly by gardens; but in\r\none spot was a piece of rough ground jagged with great stones, which\r\nhad never been cultivated since a landslip had ruined some houses there\r\ntowards the end of the thirteenth century. Just above the edge of this\r\nbroken ground stood a queer little square building, looking like a\r\ntruncated tower roofed in with fluted tiles, and close by was a small\r\nouthouse, apparently built up against a piece of ruined stone wall.\r\nUnder a large half-dead mulberry-tree that was now sending its last\r\nfluttering leaves in at the open doorways, a shrivelled, hardy old\r\nwoman was untying a goat with two kids, and Baldassarre could see that\r\npart of the outbuilding was occupied by live stock; but the door of the\r\nother part was open, and it was empty of everything but some tools and\r\nstraw. It was just the sort of place he wanted. He spoke to the old\r\nwoman; but it was not till he got close to her and shouted in her ear,\r\nthat he succeeded in making her understand his want of a lodging, and\r\nhis readiness to pay for it. At first he could get no answer beyond\r\nshakes of the head and the words, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no lodging,\xe2\x80\x9d uttered in the\r\nmuffled tone of the deaf. But, by dint of persistence, he made clear to\r\nher that he was a poor stranger from a long way over seas, and could\r\nnot afford to go to hostelries; that he only wanted to lie on the straw\r\nin the outhouse, and would pay her a quattrino or two a week for that\r\nshelter. She still looked at him dubiously, shaking her head and\r\ntalking low to herself; but presently, as if a new thought occurred to\r\nher, she fetched a hatchet from the house, and, showing him a chump\r\nthat lay half covered with litter in a corner, asked him if he would\r\nchop that up for her: if he would, he might lie in the outhouse for one\r\nnight. He agreed, and Monna Lisa stood with her arms akimbo to watch\r\nhim, with a smile of gratified cunning, saying low to herself\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lain there ever since my old man died. What then? I might as well\r\nhave put a stone on the fire. He chops very well, though he does speak\r\nwith a foreign tongue, and looks odd. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got it done\r\ncheaper. And if he only wants a bit of straw to lie on, I might make\r\nhim do an errand or two up and down the hill. Who need know? And sin\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s hidden\xe2\x80\x99s half forgiven. (\xe2\x80\x98Peccato celato e mezzo perdonato.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a stranger: he\xe2\x80\x99ll take no notice of _her_. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her to\r\nkeep her tongue still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe antecedent to these feminine pronouns had a pair of blue eyes,\r\nwhich at that moment were applied to a large round hole in the shutter\r\nof the upper window. The shutter was closed, not for any penal reasons,\r\nbut because only the opposite window had the luxury of glass in it: the\r\nweather was not warm, and a round hole four inches in diameter served\r\nall the purposes of observation. The hole was, unfortunately, a little\r\ntoo high, and obliged the small observer to stand on a low stool of a\r\nrickety character; but Tessa would have stood a long while in a much\r\nmore inconvenient position for the sake of seeing a little variety in\r\nher life. She had been drawn to the opening at the first loud tones of\r\nthe strange voice speaking to Monna Lisa; and darting gently across her\r\nroom every now and then to peep at something, she continued to stand\r\nthere until the wood had been chopped, and she saw Baldassarre enter\r\nthe outhouse, as the dusk was gathering, and seat himself on the straw.\r\n\r\nA great temptation had laid hold of Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s mind; she would go and take\r\nthat old man part of her supper, and talk to him a little. He was not\r\ndeaf like Monna Lisa, and besides she could say a great many things to\r\nhim that it was no use to shout at Monna Lisa, who knew them already.\r\nAnd he was a stranger\xe2\x80\x94strangers came from a long way off and went away\r\nagain, and lived nowhere in particular. It was naughty, she knew, for\r\nobedience made the largest part in Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s idea of duty; but it would\r\nbe something to confess to the Padre next Pasqua, and there was nothing\r\nelse to confess except going to sleep sometimes over her beads, and\r\nbeing a little cross with Monna Lisa because she was so deaf; for she\r\nhad as much idleness as she liked now, and was never frightened into\r\ntelling white lies. She turned away from her shutter with rather an\r\nexcited expression in her childish face, which was as pretty and\r\npouting as ever. Her garb was still that of a simple contadina, but of\r\na contadina prepared for a festa: her gown of dark-green serge, with\r\nits red girdle, was very clean and neat; she had the string of red\r\nglass beads round her neck; and her brown hair, rough from curliness,\r\nwas duly knotted up, and fastened with the silver pin. She had but one\r\nnew ornament, and she was very proud of it, for it was a fine gold\r\nring.\r\n\r\nTessa sat on the low stool, nursing her knees, for a minute or two,\r\nwith her little soul poised in fluttering excitement on the edge of\r\nthis pleasant transgression. It was quite irresistible. She had been\r\ncommanded to make no acquaintances, and warned that if she did, all her\r\nnew happy lot would vanish away, and be like a hidden treasure that\r\nturned to lead as soon as it was brought to the daylight; and she had\r\nbeen so obedient that when she had to go to church she had kept her\r\nface shaded by her hood and had pursed up her lips quite tightly. It\r\nwas true her obedience had been a little helped by her own dread lest\r\nthe alarming stepfather Nofri should turn up even in this quarter, so\r\nfar from the Por\xe2\x80\x99 del Prato, and beat her at least, if he did not drag\r\nher back to work for him. But this old man was not an acquaintance; he\r\nwas a poor stranger going to sleep in the outhouse, and he probably\r\nknew nothing of stepfather Nofri; and, besides, if she took him some\r\nsupper, he would like her, and not want to tell anything about her.\r\nMonna Lisa would say she must not go and talk to him, therefore Monna\r\nLisa must not be consulted. It did not signify what she found out after\r\nit had been done.\r\n\r\nSupper was being prepared, she knew\xe2\x80\x94a mountain of macaroni flavoured\r\nwith cheese, fragrant enough to tame any stranger. So she tripped\r\ndown-stairs with a mind full of deep designs, and first asking with an\r\ninnocent look what that noise of talking had been, without waiting for\r\nan answer, knit her brow with a peremptory air, something like a kitten\r\ntrying to be formidable, and sent the old woman upstairs; saying, she\r\nchose to eat her supper down below. In three minutes Tessa with her\r\nlantern in one hand and a wooden bowl of macaroni in the other, was\r\nkicking gently at the door of the outhouse; and Baldassarre, roused\r\nfrom sad reverie, doubted in the first moment whether he were awake as\r\nhe opened the door and saw this surprising little handmaid, with\r\ndelight in her wide eyes, breaking in on his dismal loneliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you some supper,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, lifting her mouth towards his\r\near and shouting, as if he had been deaf like Monna Lisa. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down and\r\neat it, while I stay with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurprise and distrust surmounted every other feeling in Baldassarre,\r\nbut though he had no smile or word of gratitude ready, there could not\r\nbe any impulse to push away this visitant, and he sank down passively\r\non his straw again, while Tessa placed herself close to him, put the\r\nwooden bowl on his lap, and set down the lantern in front of them,\r\ncrossing her hands before her, and nodding at the bowl with a\r\nsignificant smile, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may really eat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFor, in the excitement of carrying out her deed, she had forgotten her\r\nprevious thought that the stranger would not be deaf, and had fallen\r\ninto her habitual alternative of dumb show and shouting.\r\n\r\nThe invitation was not a disagreeable one, for he had been gnawing a\r\nremnant of dry bread, which had left plenty of appetite for anything\r\nwarm and relishing. Tessa watched the disappearance of two or three\r\nmouthfuls without speaking, for she had thought his eyes rather fierce\r\nat first; but now she ventured to put her mouth to his ear again and\r\ncry\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like my supper, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not a smile, but rather the milder look of a dog touched by\r\nkindness, but unable to smile, that Baldassarre turned on this round\r\nblue-eyed thing that was caring about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can hear well\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not deaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true; I forgot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, lifting her hands and clasping\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Monna Lisa is deaf, and I live with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s a kind old\r\nwoman, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not frightened at her. And we live very well: we have\r\nplenty of nice things. I can have nuts if I like. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not obliged\r\nto work now. I used to have to work, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it; but I liked\r\nfeeding the mules, and I should like to see poor Giannetta, the little\r\nmule, again. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only got a goat and two kids, and I used to talk to\r\nthe goat a good deal, because there was nobody else but Monna Lisa. But\r\nnow I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something else\xe2\x80\x94can you guess what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew her head back, and looked with a challenging smile at\r\nBaldassarre, as if she had proposed a difficult riddle to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting aside his bowl, and looking at her dreamily. It\r\nseemed as if this young prattling thing were some memory come back out\r\nof his own youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like me to talk to you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you must not\r\ntell anybody. Shall I fetch you a bit of cold sausage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, but he looked so mild now that Tessa felt quite at\r\nher ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little baby. Such a pretty bambinetto, with\r\nlittle fingers and nails! Not old yet; it was born at the Nativita,\r\nMonna Lisa says. I was married one Nativita, a long, long while ago,\r\nand nobody knew. O Santa Madonna! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell you that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa set up her shoulders and bit her lip, looking at Baldassarre as\r\nif this betrayal of secrets must have an exciting effect on him too.\r\nBut he seemed not to care much; and perhaps that was in the nature of\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, carrying on her thought aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a stranger;\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t live anywhere or know anybody, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, also thinking aloud, rather than consciously\r\nanswering, \xe2\x80\x9cI only know one man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is not Nofri, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, noticing her look of fear. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat mistaken supposition was very amusing to Tessa. She laughed and\r\nclapped her hands as she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed! But I must not tell you anything about my husband. You\r\nwould never think what he is\xe2\x80\x94not at all like Nofri!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed again at the delightful incongruity between the name of\r\nNofri\xe2\x80\x94which was not separable from the idea of the cross-grained\r\nstepfather\xe2\x80\x94and the idea of her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t see him very often,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, more gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nsometimes I pray to the Holy Madonna to send him oftener, and once she\r\ndid. But I must go back to my bimbo now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it to show you\r\nto-morrow. You would like to see it. Sometimes it cries and makes a\r\nface, but only when it\xe2\x80\x99s hungry, Monna Lisa says. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit, but Monna Lisa had babies once, and they are all dead old men. My\r\nhusband says she will never die now, because she\xe2\x80\x99s so well dried. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad of that, for I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of her. You would like to stay here\r\nto-morrow, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have this place to come and rest in, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Baldassarre. \xe2\x80\x9cI would pay for it, and harm nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed; I think you are not a bad old man. But you look sorry\r\nabout something. Tell me, is there anything you shall cry about when I\r\nleave you by yourself? _I_ used to cry once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, child; I think I shall cry no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you some breakfast, and show you the\r\nbimbo. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa took up her bowl and lantern, and closed the door behind her. The\r\npretty loving apparition had been no more to Baldassarre than a faint\r\nrainbow on the blackness to the man who is wrestling in deep waters. He\r\nhardly thought of her again till his dreamy waking passed into the more\r\nvivid images of disturbed sleep.\r\n\r\nBut Tessa thought much of him. She had no sooner entered the house than\r\nshe told Monna Lisa what she had done, and insisted that the stranger\r\nshould be allowed to come and rest in the outhouse when he liked. The\r\nold woman, who had had her notions of making him a useful tenant, made\r\na great show of reluctance, shook her head, and urged that Messer Naldo\r\nwould be angry if she let any one come about the house. Tessa did not\r\nbelieve that. Naldo had said nothing against strangers who lived\r\nnowhere; and this old man knew nobody except one person, who was not\r\nNofri.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d conceded Monna Lisa, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cif I let him stay for a while\r\nand carry things up the hill for me, thou must keep thy counsel and\r\ntell nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll only tell the bimbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d Monna Lisa went on, in her thick undertone, \xe2\x80\x9cGod may love\r\nus well enough not to let Messer Naldo find out anything about it. For\r\nhe never comes here but at dark; and as he was here two days ago, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlikely he\xe2\x80\x99ll never come at all till the old man\xe2\x80\x99s gone away again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh me! Monna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, clasping her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Naldo had not\r\nto go such a long, long way sometimes before he comes back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, child! the world\xe2\x80\x99s big, they say. There are places behind the\r\nmountains, and if people go night and day, night and day, they get to\r\nRome, and see the Holy Father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa looked submissive in the presence of this mystery, and began to\r\nrock her baby, and sing syllables of vague loving meaning, in tones\r\nthat imitated a triple chime.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she was unusually industrious in the prospect of more\r\ndialogue, and of the pleasure she should give the poor old stranger by\r\nshowing him her baby. But before she could get ready to take\r\nBaldassarre his breakfast, she found that Monna Lisa had been employing\r\nhim as a drawer of water. She deferred her paternosters, and hurried\r\ndown to insist that Baldassarre should sit on his straw, so that she\r\nmight come and sit by him again while he ate his breakfast. That\r\nattitude made the new companionship all the more delightful to Tessa,\r\nfor she had been used to sitting on straw in old days along with her\r\ngoats and mules.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not let Monna Lisa give you too much work to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nbringing him some steaming broth and soft bread. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like much\r\nwork, and I daresay you don\xe2\x80\x99t. I like sitting in the sunshine and\r\nfeeding things. Monna Lisa says, work is good, but she does it all\r\nherself, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. She\xe2\x80\x99s not a cross old woman; you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid of her being cross. And now, you eat that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch\r\nmy baby and show it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently she came back with the small mummy-case in her arms. The\r\nmummy looked very lively, having unusually large dark eyes, though no\r\nmore than the usual indication of a future nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my baby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, seating herself close to Baldassarre.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was so pretty, did you? It is like the little\r\nGesu, and I should think the Santa Madonna would be kinder to me now,\r\nis it not true? But I have not much to ask for, because I have\r\neverything now\xe2\x80\x94only that I should see my husband oftener. You may hold\r\nthe bambino a little if you like, but I think you must not kiss him,\r\nbecause you might hurt him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke this prohibition in a tone of soothing excuse, and\r\nBaldassarre could not refuse to hold the small package. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing!\r\npoor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a deep voice which had something strangely\r\nthreatening in its apparent pity. It did not seem to him as if this\r\nguileless loving little woman could reconcile him to the world at all,\r\nbut rather that she was with him against the world, that she was a\r\ncreature who would need to be avenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be sorry for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cfor though I don\xe2\x80\x99t see him\r\noften, he is more beautiful and good than anybody else in the world. I\r\nsay prayers to him when he\xe2\x80\x99s away. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think what he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at Baldassarre with a wide glance of mysterious meaning,\r\ntaking the baby from him again, and almost wishing he would question\r\nher as if he wanted very much to know more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, rather bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you never could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou thought he\r\nmight be Nofri,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a triumphant air of conclusiveness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut never mind; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know. What is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his hand over his knitted brow, then looked at her blankly\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, child, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not that he did not often remember his name well enough; and if\r\nhe had had presence of mind now to remember it, he would have chosen\r\nnot to tell it. But a sudden question appealing to his memory, had a\r\nparalysing effect, and in that moment he was conscious of nothing but\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\nIgnorant as Tessa was, the pity stirred in her by his blank look taught\r\nher to say\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Never_ mind: you are a stranger, it is no matter about your having a\r\nname. Good-bye now, because I want my breakfast. You will come here and\r\nrest when you like; Monna Lisa says you may. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you be unhappy,\r\nfor we\xe2\x80\x99ll be good to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nNo Place for Repentance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Naldo came again sooner than was expected: he came on the\r\nevening of the twenty-eighth of November, only eleven days after his\r\nprevious visit, proving that he had not gone far beyond the mountains;\r\nand a scene which we have witnessed as it took place that evening in\r\nthe Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi may help to explain the impulse which turned his\r\nsteps towards the hill of San Giorgio.\r\n\r\nWhen Tito had first found this home for Tessa, on his return from Rome,\r\nmore than a year and a half ago, he had acted, he persuaded himself,\r\nsimply under the constraint imposed on him by his own kindliness after\r\nthe unlucky incident which had made foolish little Tessa imagine him to\r\nbe her husband. It was true that the kindness was manifested towards a\r\npretty trusting thing whom it was impossible to be near without feeling\r\ninclined to caress and pet her; but it was not less true that Tito had\r\nmovements of kindness towards her apart from any contemplated gain to\r\nhimself. Otherwise, charming as her prettiness and prattle were in a\r\nlazy moment, he might have preferred to be free from her; for he was\r\nnot in love with Tessa\xe2\x80\x94he was in love for the first time in his life\r\nwith an entirely different woman, whom he was not simply inclined to\r\nshower caresses on, but whose presence possessed him so that the simple\r\nsweep of her long tresses across his cheek seemed to vibrate through\r\nthe hours. All the young ideal passion he had in him had been stirred\r\nby Romola, and his fibre was too fine, his intellect too bright, for\r\nhim to be tempted into the habits of a gross pleasure-seeker. But he\r\nhad spun a web about himself and Tessa, which he felt incapable of\r\nbreaking: in the first moments after the mimic marriage he had been\r\nprompted to leave her under an illusion by a distinct calculation of\r\nhis own possible need, but since that critical moment it seemed to him\r\nthat the web had gone on spinning itself in spite of him, like a growth\r\nover which he had no power. The elements of kindness and\r\nself-indulgence are hard to distinguish in a soft nature like Tito\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nand the annoyance he had felt under Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of him on the day\r\nof his betrothal, the thorough intention of revealing the truth to her\r\nwith which he set out to fulfil his promise of seeing her again, were a\r\nsufficiently strong argument to him that in ultimately leaving Tessa\r\nunder her illusion and providing a home for her, he had been overcome\r\nby his own kindness. And in these days of his first devotion to Romola\r\nhe needed a self-justifying argument. He had learned to be glad that\r\nshe was deceived about some things. But every strong feeling makes to\r\nitself a conscience of its own\xe2\x80\x94has its own piety; just as much as the\r\nfeeling of the son towards the mother, which will sometimes survive\r\namid the worst fumes of depravation; and Tito could not yet be easy in\r\ncommitting a secret offence against his wedded love.\r\n\r\nBut he was all the more careful in taking precautions to preserve the\r\nsecrecy of the offence. Monna Lisa, who, like many of her class, never\r\nleft her habitation except to go to one or two particular shops, and to\r\nconfession once a year, knew nothing of his real name and whereabout:\r\nshe only know that he paid her so as to make her very comfortable, and\r\nminded little about the rest, save that she got fond of Tessa, and\r\nfound pleasure in the cares for which she was paid. There was some\r\nmystery behind, clearly, since Tessa was a contadina, and Messer Naldo\r\nwas a signor; but, for aught Monna Lisa knew, he might be a real\r\nhusband. For Tito had thoroughly frightened Tessa into silence about\r\nthe circumstances of their marriage, by telling her that if she broke\r\nthat silence she would never see him again; and Monna Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s deafness,\r\nwhich made it impossible to say anything to her without some\r\npremeditation, had saved Tessa from any incautious revelation to her,\r\nsuch as had run off her tongue in talking with Baldassarre. For a long\r\nwhile Tito\xe2\x80\x99s visits were so rare, that it seemed likely enough he took\r\njourneys between them. They were prompted chiefly by the desire to see\r\nthat all things were going on well with Tessa; and though he always\r\nfound his visit pleasanter than the prospect of it\xe2\x80\x94always felt anew the\r\ncharm of that pretty ignorant lovingness and trust\xe2\x80\x94he had not yet any\r\nreal need of it. But he was determined, if possible, to preserve the\r\nsimplicity on which the charm depended; to keep Tessa a genuine\r\ncontadina, and not place the small field-flower among conditions that\r\nwould rob it of its grace. He would have been shocked to see her in the\r\ndress of any other rank than her own; the piquancy of her talk would be\r\nall gone, if things began to have new relations for her, if her world\r\nbecame wider, her pleasures less childish; and the squirrel-like\r\nenjoyment of nuts at discretion marked the standard of the luxuries he\r\nhad provided for her. By this means, Tito saved Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s charm from\r\nbeing sullied; and he also, by a convenient coincidence, saved himself\r\nfrom aggravating expenses that were already rather importunate to a man\r\nwhose money was all required for his avowed habits of life.\r\n\r\nThis, in brief, had been the history of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s relation to Tessa up to\r\na very recent date. It is true that once or twice before Bardo\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nthe sense that there was Tessa up the hill, with whom it was possible\r\nto pass an hour agreeably, had been an inducement to him to escape from\r\na little weariness of the old man, when, for lack of any positive\r\nengagement, he might otherwise have borne the weariness patiently and\r\nshared Romola\xe2\x80\x99s burden. But the moment when he had first felt a real\r\nhunger for Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s ignorant lovingness and belief in _him_ had not come\r\ntill quite lately, and it was distinctly marked out by circumstances as\r\nlittle to be forgotten as the oncoming of a malady that has permanently\r\nvitiated the sight and hearing. It was the day when he had first seen\r\nBaldassarre, and had bought the armour. Returning across the bridge\r\nthat night, with the coat of mail in his hands, he had felt an\r\nunconquerable shrinking from an immediate encounter with Romola. She,\r\ntoo, knew little of the actual world; she, too, trusted him; but he had\r\nan uneasy consciousness that behind her frank eyes there was a nature\r\nthat could judge him, and that any ill-founded trust of hers sprang not\r\nfrom pretty brute-like incapacity, but from a nobleness which might\r\nprove an alarming touchstone. He wanted a little ease, a little repose\r\nfrom self-control, after the agitation and exertions of the day; he\r\nwanted to be where he could adjust his mind to the morrow, without\r\ncaring how he behaved at the present moment. And there was a sweet\r\nadoring creature within reach whose presence was as safe and\r\nunconstraining as that of her own kids,\xe2\x80\x94who would believe any fable,\r\nand remain quite unimpressed by public opinion. And so on that evening,\r\nwhen Romola was waiting and listening for him, he turned his steps up\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that the steps took the same course on this evening,\r\neleven days later, when he had had to recoil under Romola\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\noutburst of scorn. He could not wish Tessa in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s place, or\r\nrefrain from wishing that his wife should be thoroughly reconciled to\r\nhim; for it was Romola, and not Tessa, that belonged to the world where\r\nall the larger desires of a man who had ambition and effective\r\nfaculties must necessarily lie. But he wanted a refuge from a standard\r\ndisagreeably rigorous, of which he could not make himself independent\r\nsimply by thinking it folly; and Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s little soul was that inviting\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nIt was not much more than eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he went up the stone steps\r\nto the door of Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s room. Usually she heard his entrance into the\r\nhouse, and ran to meet him, but not to-night; and when he opened the\r\ndoor he saw the reason. A single dim light was burning above the dying\r\nfire, and showed Tessa in a kneeling attitude by the head of the bed\r\nwhere the baby lay. Her head had fallen aside on the pillow, and her\r\nbrown rosary, which usually hung above the pillow over the picture of\r\nthe Madonna and the golden palm-branches, lay in the loose grasp of her\r\nright-hand. She had gone fast asleep over her beads. Tito stepped\r\nlightly across the little room, and sat down close to her. She had\r\nprobably heard the opening of the door as part of her dream, for he had\r\nnot been looking at her two moments before she opened her eyes. She\r\nopened them without any start, and remained quite motionless looking at\r\nhim, as if the sense that he was there smiling at her shut out any\r\nimpulse which could disturb that happy passiveness. But when he put his\r\nhand under her chin, and stooped to kiss her, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dreamed it, and then I said it was dreaming\xe2\x80\x94and then I awoke, and it\r\nwas true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle sinner!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, pinching her chin, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not said half\r\nyour prayers. I will punish you by not looking at your baby; it is\r\nugly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa did not like those words, even though Tito was smiling. She had\r\nsome pouting distress in her face, as she said, bending anxiously over\r\nthe baby\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it is not true! He is prettier than anything. You do not think he\r\nis ugly. You will look at him. He is even prettier than when you saw\r\nhim before\xe2\x80\x94only he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t see his eyes or his tongue,\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t show you his hair\xe2\x80\x94and it grows\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that wonderful? Look\r\nat him! It\xe2\x80\x99s true his face is very much all alike when he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep,\r\nthere is not so much to see as when he\xe2\x80\x99s awake. If you kiss him very\r\ngently, he won\xe2\x80\x99t wake: you want to kiss him, is it not true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe satisfied her by giving the small mummy a butterfly kiss, and then\r\nputting his hand on her shoulder and turning her face towards him,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou like looking at the baby better than looking at your\r\nhusband, you false one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was still kneeling, and now rested her hands on his knee, looking\r\nup at him like one of Fra Lippo Lippi\xe2\x80\x99s round-cheeked adoring angels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shaking her head; \xe2\x80\x9cI love you always best, only I want\r\nyou to look at the bambino and love him; I used only to want you to\r\nlove me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you expect me to come again so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, inclined to\r\nmake her prattle. He still felt the effects of the agitation he had\r\nundergone\xe2\x80\x94still felt like a man who has been violently jarred; and this\r\nwas the easiest relief from silence and solitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, \xe2\x80\x9cI have counted the days\xe2\x80\x94to-day I began at my\r\nright thumb again\xe2\x80\x94since you put on the beautiful chain-coat, that\r\nMesser San Michele gave you to take care of you on your journey. And\r\nyou have got it on now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, peeping through the opening in the\r\nbreast of his tunic. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it made you come back sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it did, Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the coat now. Tell me\r\nwhat has happened since I was here. Did you see the tents in the Prato,\r\nand the soldiers and horsemen when they passed the bridges\xe2\x80\x94did you hear\r\nthe drums and trumpets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I was rather frightened, because I thought the soldiers might\r\ncome up here. And Monna Lisa was a little afraid too, for she said they\r\nmight carry our kids off; she said it was their business to do\r\nmischief. But the Holy Madonna took care of us, for we never saw one of\r\nthem up here. But something has happened, only I hardly dare tell you,\r\nand that is what I was saying more Aves for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Tessa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, rather anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cMake haste and\r\ntell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but will you let me sit on your knee? because then I think I\r\nshall not be so frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her on his knee, and put his arm round her, but looked grave:\r\nit seemed that something unpleasant must pursue him even here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, speaking almost in a\r\nwhisper, as if that would mitigate the offence; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we thought the\r\nold man would be gone away before you came again, and it would be as if\r\nit had not been. But now he is there, and you are come, and I never did\r\nanything you told me not to do before. And I want to tell you, and then\r\nyou will perhaps forgive me, for it is a long while before I go to\r\nconfession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, tell me everything, my Tessa.\xe2\x80\x9d He began to hope it was after all\r\na trivial matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you will be sorry for him: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid he cries about something\r\nwhen I don\xe2\x80\x99t see him. But that was not the reason I went to him first;\r\nit was because I wanted to talk to him and show him my baby, and he was\r\na stranger that lived nowhere, and I thought you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care so much\r\nabout my talking to him. And I think he is not a bad old man, and he\r\nwanted to come and sleep on the straw next to the goats, and I made\r\nMonna Lisa say, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, he might,\xe2\x80\x99 and he\xe2\x80\x99s away all the day almost, but\r\nwhen he comes back I talk to him, and take him something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome beggar, I suppose. It was naughty of you, Tessa, and I am angry\r\nwith Monna Lisa. I must have him sent away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think he is not a beggar, for he wanted to pay Monna Lisa, only\r\nshe asked him to do work for her instead. And he gets himself shaved,\r\nand his clothes are tidy: Monna Lisa says he is a decent man. But\r\nsometimes I think he is not in his right mind: Lupo, at Peretola, was\r\nnot in his right mind, and he looks a little like Lupo sometimes, as if\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of face has he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, his heart beginning to beat\r\nstrangely. He was so haunted by the thought of Baldassarre, that it was\r\nalready he whom he saw in imagination sitting on the straw not many\r\nyards from him. \xe2\x80\x9cFetch your stool, my Tessa, and sit on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you not forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, timidly, moving from his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will not be angry\xe2\x80\x94only sit down, and tell me what sort of old\r\nman this is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think how to tell you: he is not like my stepfather Nofri, or\r\nanybody. His face is yellow, and he has deep marks in it; and his hair\r\nis white, but there is none on the top of his head: and his eyebrows\r\nare black, and he looks from under them at me, and says, \xe2\x80\x98Poor thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto me, as if he thought I was beaten as I used to be; and that seems as\r\nif he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in his right mind, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And I asked him his\r\nname once, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell it me: yet everybody has a name\xe2\x80\x94is it\r\nnot true? And he has a book now, and keeps looking at it ever so long,\r\nas if he were a Padre. But I think he is not saying prayers, for his\r\nlips never move;\xe2\x80\x94ah, you are angry with me, or is it because you are\r\nsorry for the old man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were still fixed on Tessa; but he had ceased to see her,\r\nand was only seeing the objects her words suggested. It was this absent\r\nglance which frightened her, and she could not help going to kneel at\r\nhis side again. But he did not heed her, and she dared not touch him,\r\nor speak to him: she knelt, trembling and wondering; and this state of\r\nmind suggesting her beads to her, she took them from the floor, and\r\nbegan to tell them again, her pretty lips moving silently, and her blue\r\neyes wide with anxiety and struggling tears.\r\n\r\nTito was quite unconscious of her movements\xe2\x80\x94unconscious of his own\r\nattitude: he was in that wrapt state in which a man will grasp painful\r\nroughness, and press and press it closer, and never feel it. A new\r\npossibility had risen before him, which might dissolve at once the\r\nwretched conditions of fear and suppression that were marring his life.\r\nDestiny had brought within his reach an opportunity of retrieving that\r\nmoment on the steps of the Duomo, when the Past had grasped him with\r\nliving quivering hands, and he had disowned it. A few steps, and he\r\nmight be face to face with his father, with no witness by; he might\r\nseek forgiveness and reconciliation; and there was money now, from the\r\nsale of the library, to enable them to leave Florence without\r\ndisclosure, and go into Southern Italy, where under the probable French\r\nrule, he had already laid a foundation for patronage. Romola need never\r\nknow the whole truth, for she could have no certain means of\r\nidentifying that prisoner in the Duomo with Baldassarre, or of learning\r\nwhat had taken place on the steps, except from Baldassarre himself; and\r\nif his father forgave, he would also consent to bury, that offence.\r\n\r\nBut with this possibility of relief, by an easy spring, from present\r\nevil, there rose the other possibility, that the fierce-hearted man\r\nmight refuse to be propitiated. Well\xe2\x80\x94and if he did, things would only\r\nbe as they had been before; for there would be _no witness by_. It was\r\nnot repentance with a white sheet round it and taper in hand,\r\nconfessing its hated sin in the eyes of men, that Tito was preparing\r\nfor: it was a repentance that would make all things pleasant again, and\r\nkeep all past unpleasant things secret. And Tito\xe2\x80\x99s soft-heartedness,\r\nhis indisposition to feel himself in harsh relations with any creature,\r\nwas in strong activity towards his father, now his father was brought\r\nnear to him. It would be a state of ease that his nature could not but\r\ndesire, if the poisonous hatred in Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s glance could be\r\nreplaced by something of the old affection and complacency.\r\n\r\nTito longed to have his world once again completely cushioned with\r\ngoodwill, and longed for it the more eagerly because of what he had\r\njust suffered from the collision with Romola. It was not difficult to\r\nhim to smile pleadingly on those whom he had injured, and offer to do\r\nthem much kindness: and no quickness of intellect could tell him\r\nexactly the taste of that honey on the lips of the injured. The\r\nopportunity was there, and it raised an inclination which hemmed in the\r\ncalculating activity of his thought. He started up, and stepped towards\r\nthe door; but Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s cry, as she dropped her beads, roused him from\r\nhis absorption. He turned and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Tessa, get me a lantern; and don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, little pigeon, I am not\r\nangry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went down the stairs, and Tessa was going to shout the need of the\r\nlantern in Monna Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s ear, when Tito, who had opened the door, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, Tessa\xe2\x80\x94no, I want no lantern: go upstairs again, and keep quiet,\r\nand say nothing to Monna Lisa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn half a minute he stood before the closed door of the outhouse, where\r\nthe moon was shining white on the old paintless wood.\r\n\r\nIn this last decisive moment, Tito felt a tremor upon him\xe2\x80\x94a sudden\r\ninstinctive shrinking from a possible tiger-glance, a possible\r\ntiger-leap. Yet why should he, a young man, be afraid of an old one? a\r\nyoung man with armour on, of an old man without a weapon? It was but a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, and Tito laid his hand on the door. Was his father\r\nasleep? Was there nothing else but the door that screened him from the\r\nvoice and the glance which no magic could turn into ease?\r\n\r\nBaldassarre was not asleep. There was a square opening high in the wall\r\nof the hovel, through which the moonbeams sent in a stream of pale\r\nlight; and if Tito could have looked through the opening, he would have\r\nseen his father seated on the straw, with something that shone like a\r\nwhite star in his hand. Baldassarre was feeling the edge of his\r\nponiard, taking refuge in that sensation from a hopeless blank of\r\nthought that seemed to lie like a great gulf between his passion and\r\nits aim.\r\n\r\nHe was in one of his most wretched moments of conscious helplessness:\r\nhe had been poring, while it was light, over the book that lay open\r\nbeside him; then he had been trying to recall the names of his jewels,\r\nand the symbols engraved on them; and though at certain other times he\r\nhad recovered some of those names and symbols, to-night they were all\r\ngone into darkness. And this effort at inward seeing had seemed to end\r\nin utter paralysis of memory. He was reduced to a sort of mad\r\nconsciousness that he was a solitary pulse of just rage in a world\r\nfilled with defiant baseness. He had clutched and unsheathed his\r\ndagger, and for a long while had been feeling its edge, his mind\r\nnarrowed to one image, and the dream of one sensation\xe2\x80\x94the sensation of\r\nplunging that dagger into a base heart, which he was unable to pierce\r\nin any other way.\r\n\r\nTito had his hand on the door and was pulling it: it dragged against\r\nthe ground as such old doors often do, and Baldassarre, startled out of\r\nhis dreamlike state, rose from his sitting posture in vague amazement,\r\nnot knowing where he was. He had not yet risen to his feet, and was\r\nstill kneeling on one knee, when the door came wide open and he saw,\r\ndark against the moonlight, with the rays falling on one bright mass of\r\ncurls and one rounded olive cheek, the image of his reverie\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nshadowy\xe2\x80\x94close and real like water at the lips after the thirsty dream\r\nof it. No thought could come athwart that eager thirst. In one moment,\r\nbefore Tito could start back, the old man, with the preternatural force\r\nof rage in his limbs, had sprung forward, and the dagger had flashed\r\nout. In the next moment the dagger had snapped in two, and Baldassarre,\r\nunder the parrying force of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s arm, had fallen back on the straw,\r\nclutching the hilt with its bit of broken blade. The pointed end lay\r\nshining against Tito\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nTito had felt one great heart-leap of terror as he had staggered under\r\nthe weight of the thrust: he felt now the triumph of deliverance and\r\nsafety. His armour had been proved, and vengeance lay helpless before\r\nhim. But the triumph raised no devilish impulse; on the contrary, the\r\nsight of his father close to him and unable to injure him, made the\r\neffort at reconciliation easier. He was free from fear, but he had only\r\nthe more unmixed and direct want to be free from the sense that he was\r\nhated. After they had looked at each other a little while, Baldassarre\r\nlying motionless in despairing rage, Tito said in his soft tones, just\r\nas they had sounded before the last parting on the shores of Greece\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Padre mio_!\xe2\x80\x9d There was a pause after those words, but no movement or\r\nsound till he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to ask your forgiveness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he paused, that the healing balm of those words might have time\r\nto work. But there was no sign of change in Baldassarre: he lay as he\r\nhad fallen, leaning on one arm: he was trembling, but it was from the\r\nshock that had thrown him down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was taken by surprise that morning. I wish now to be a son to you\r\nagain. I wish to make the rest of your life happy, that you may forget\r\nwhat you have suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused again. He had used the clearest and strongest words he could\r\nthink of. It was useless to say more, until he had some sign that\r\nBaldassarre understood him. Perhaps his mind was too distempered or too\r\nimbecile even for that: perhaps the shock of his fall and his\r\ndisappointed rage might have quite suspended the use of his faculties.\r\n\r\nPresently Baldassarre began to move. He threw away the broken dagger,\r\nand slowly and gradually, still trembling, began to raise himself from\r\nthe ground. Tito put out his hand to help him, and so strangely quick\r\nare men\xe2\x80\x99s souls that in this moment, when he began to feel his\r\natonement was accepted, he had a darting thought of the irksome efforts\r\nit entailed. Baldassarre clutched the hand that was held out, raised\r\nhimself and clutched it still, going close up to Tito till their faces\r\nwere not a foot off each other. Then he began to speak, in a deep\r\ntrembling voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saved you\xe2\x80\x94I nurtured you\xe2\x80\x94I loved you. You forsook me\xe2\x80\x94you robbed\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94you denied me. What can you give me? You have made the world\r\nbitterness to me; but there is one draught of sweetness left\xe2\x80\x94_that you\r\nshall know agony_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe let fall Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and going backwards a little, first rested his\r\narm on a projecting stone in the wall, and then sank again in a sitting\r\nposture on the straw. The outleap of fury in the dagger-thrust had\r\nevidently exhausted him.\r\n\r\nTito stood silent. If it had been a deep yearning emotion which had\r\nbrought him to ask his father\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness, the denial of it might\r\nhave caused him a pang which would have excluded the rushing train of\r\nthought that followed those decisive words. As it was, though the\r\nsentence of unchangeable hatred grated on him and jarred him terribly,\r\nhis mind glanced round with a self-preserving instinct to see how far\r\nthose words could have the force of a substantial threat. When he had\r\ncome down to speak to Baldassarre, he had said to himself that if his\r\neffort at reconciliation failed, things would only be as they had been\r\nbefore. The first glance of his mind was backward to that thought\r\nagain, but the future possibilities of danger that were conjured up\r\nalong with it brought the perception that things were _not_ as they had\r\nbeen before, and the perception came as a triumphant relief. There was\r\nnot only the broken dagger, there was the certainty, from what Tessa\r\nhad told him, that Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s mind was broken too, and had no edge\r\nthat could reach him. Tito felt he had no choice now: he must defy\r\nBaldassarre as a mad, imbecile old man; and the chances were so\r\nstrongly on his side that there was hardly room for fear. No; except\r\nthe fear of having to do many unpleasant things in order to save\r\nhimself from what was yet more unpleasant. And one of those unpleasant\r\nthings must be done immediately: it was very difficult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to stay here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mean to turn me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; \xe2\x80\x9cI only ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, you have turned me out. If it is your straw, you turned me\r\noff it three years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you mean to leave this place?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, more anxious about this\r\ncertainty than the ground of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre.\r\n\r\nTito turned and re-entered the house. Monna Lisa was nodding; he went\r\nup to Tessa, and found her crying by the side of her baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting down and taking her head between his hands;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cleave off crying, little goose, and listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lifted her chin upward, that she might look at him, while he spoke\r\nvery distinctly and emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must never speak to that old man again. He is a mad old man, and\r\nhe wants to kill me. Never speak to him or listen to him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa\xe2\x80\x99s tears had ceased, and her lips were pale with fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he gone away?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will go away. Remember what I have said to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I will never speak to a stranger any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, with a\r\nsense of guilt.\r\n\r\nHe told her, to comfort her, that he would come again to-morrow; and\r\nthen went down to Monna Lisa to rebuke her severely for letting a\r\ndangerous man come about the house.\r\n\r\nTito felt that these were odious tasks; they were very evil-tasted\r\nmorsels, but they were forced upon him. He heard Monna Lisa fasten the\r\ndoor behind him, and turned away, without looking towards the open door\r\nof the hovel. He felt secure that Baldassarre would go, and he could\r\nnot wait to see him go. Even _his_ young frame and elastic spirit were\r\nshattered by the agitations that had been crowded into this single\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nBaldassarre was still sitting on the straw when the shadow of Tito\r\npassed by. Before him lay the fragments of the broken dagger; beside\r\nhim lay the open book, over which he had pored in vain. They looked\r\nlike mocking symbols of his utter helplessness; and his body was still\r\ntoo trembling for him to rise and walk away.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning, very early, when Tessa peeped anxiously through\r\nthe hole in her shutter, the door of the hovel was open, and the\r\nstrange old man was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nWhat Florence was thinking of.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several days Tito saw little of Romola. He told her gently, the\r\nnext morning, that it would be better for her to remove any small\r\narticles of her own from the library, as there would be agents coming\r\nto pack up the antiquities. Then, leaning to kiss her on the brow, he\r\nsuggested that she should keep in her own room where the little painted\r\ntabernacle was, and where she was then sitting, so that she might be\r\naway from the noise of strange footsteps, Romola assented quietly,\r\nmaking no sign of emotion: the night had been one long waking to her,\r\nand, in spite of her healthy frame, sensation had become a dull\r\ncontinuous pain, as if she had been stunned and bruised. Tito divined\r\nthat she felt ill, but he dared say no more; he only dared, perceiving\r\nthat her hand and brow were stone cold, to fetch a furred mantle and\r\nthrow it lightly round her. And in every brief interval that he\r\nreturned to her, the scene was nearly the same: he tried to propitiate\r\nher by some unobtrusive act or word of tenderness, and she seemed to\r\nhave lost the power of speaking to him, or of looking at him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will recover it, and forgive at\r\nlast. The tie to me must still remain the strongest.\xe2\x80\x9d When the stricken\r\nperson is slow to recover and look as if nothing had happened, the\r\nstriker easily glides into the position of the aggrieved party; he\r\nfeels no bruise himself, and is strongly conscious of his own amiable\r\nbehaviour since he inflicted the blow. But Tito was not naturally\r\ndisposed to feel himself aggrieved; the constant bent of his mind was\r\ntowards propitiation, and he would have submitted to much for the sake\r\nof feeling Romola\xe2\x80\x99s hand resting on his head again, as it did that\r\nmorning when he first shrank from looking at her.\r\n\r\nBut he found it the less difficult to wait patiently for the return of\r\nhis home happiness, because his life out of doors was more and more\r\ninteresting to him. A course of action which is in strictness a\r\nslowly-prepared outgrowth of the entire character, is yet almost always\r\ntraceable to a single impression as its point of apparent origin; and\r\nsince that moment in the Piazza del Duomo, when Tito, mounted on the\r\nbales, had tasted a keen pleasure in the consciousness of his ability\r\nto tickle the ears of men with any phrases that pleased them, his\r\nimagination had glanced continually towards a sort of political\r\nactivity which the troubled public life of Florence was likely enough\r\nto find occasion for. But the fresh dread of Baldassarre, waked in the\r\nsame moment, had lain like an immovable rocky obstruction across that\r\npath, and had urged him into the sale of the library, as a preparation\r\nfor the possible necessity of leaving Florence, at the very time when\r\nhe was beginning to feel that it had a new attraction for him. That\r\ndread was nearly removed _now_: he must wear his armour still, he must\r\nprepare himself for possible demands on his coolness and ingenuity, but\r\nhe did not feel obliged to take the inconvenient step of leaving\r\nFlorence and seeking new fortunes. His father had refused the offered\r\natonement\xe2\x80\x94had forced him into defiance; and an old man in a strange\r\nplace, with his memory gone, was weak enough to be defied.\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s implicit desires were working themselves out now in very\r\nexplicit thoughts. As the freshness of young passion faded, life was\r\ntaking more and more decidedly for him the aspect of a game in which\r\nthere was an agreeable mingling of skill and chance.\r\n\r\nAnd the game that might be played in Florence promised to be rapid and\r\nexciting; it was a game of revolutionary and party struggle, sure to\r\ninclude plenty of that unavowed action in which brilliant ingenuity,\r\nable to get rid of all inconvenient beliefs except that \xe2\x80\x9cginger is hot\r\nin the mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d is apt to see the path of superior wisdom.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the French guests gone than Florence was as agitated as\r\na colony of ants when an alarming shadow has been removed, and the camp\r\nhas to be repaired. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are we to raise the money for the French king?\r\nHow are we to manage the war with those obstinate Pisan rebels? Above\r\nall, how are we to mend our plan of government, so as to hit on the\r\nbest way of getting our magistrates chosen and our laws voted?\xe2\x80\x9d Till\r\nthose questions were well answered trade was in danger of standing\r\nstill, and that large body of the working men who were not counted as\r\ncitizens and had not so much as a vote to serve as an anodyne to their\r\nstomachs were likely to get impatient. Something must be done.\r\n\r\nAnd first the great bell was sounded, to call the citizens to a\r\nparliament in the Piazza de\xe2\x80\x99 Signori; and when the crowd was wedged\r\nclose, and hemmed in by armed men at all the outlets, the Signoria (or\r\nGonfaloniere and eight Priors for the time being) came out and stood by\r\nthe stone lion on the platform in front of the Old Palace, and proposed\r\nthat twenty chief men of the city should have dictatorial authority\r\ngiven them, by force of which they should for one year choose all\r\nmagistrates, and set the frame of government in order. And the people\r\nshouted their assent, and felt themselves the electors of the Twenty.\r\nThis kind of \xe2\x80\x9cparliament\xe2\x80\x9d was a very old Florentine fashion, by which\r\nthe will of the few was made to seem the choice of the many.\r\n\r\nThe shouting in the Piazza was soon at an end, but not so the debating\r\ninside the palace: was Florence to have a Great Council after the\r\nVenetian mode, where all the officers of government might be elected,\r\nand all laws voted by a wide number of citizens of a certain age and of\r\nascertained qualifications, without question of rank or party? or, was\r\nit to be governed on a narrower and less popular scheme, in which the\r\nhereditary influence of good families would be less adulterated with\r\nthe votes of shopkeepers. Doctors of law disputed day after day, and\r\nfar on into the night. Messer Pagolantonio Soderini alleged excellent\r\nreasons on the side of the popular scheme; Messer Guidantonio Vespucci\r\nalleged reasons equally excellent on the side of a more aristocratic\r\nform. It was a question of boiled or roast, which had been prejudged by\r\nthe palates of the disputants, and the excellent arguing might have\r\nbeen protracted a long while without any other result than that of\r\ndeferring the cooking. The majority of the men inside the palace,\r\nhaving power already in their hands, agreed with Vespucci, and thought\r\nchange should be moderate; the majority outside the palace, conscious\r\nof little power and many grievances, were less afraid of change.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a force outside the palace which was gradually tending to\r\ngive the vague desires of that majority the character of a determinate\r\nwill. That force was the preaching of Savonarola. Impelled partly by\r\nthe spiritual necessity that was laid upon him to guide the people, and\r\npartly by the prompting of public-men who could get no measures carried\r\nwithout his aid, he was rapidly passing in his daily sermons from the\r\ngeneral to the special\xe2\x80\x94from telling his hearers that they must postpone\r\ntheir private passions and interests to the public good, to telling\r\nthem precisely what sort of government they must have in order to\r\npromote that good\xe2\x80\x94from \xe2\x80\x9cChoose whatever is best for all\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cChoose the\r\nGreat Council,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Great Council is the will of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Savonarola these were as good as identical propositions. The Great\r\nCouncil was the only practicable plan for giving an expression to the\r\npublic will large enough to counteract the vitiating influence of party\r\ninterests: it was a plan that would make honest impartial public action\r\nat least possible. And the purer the government of Florence would\r\nbecome\xe2\x80\x94the more secure from the designs of men who saw their own\r\nadvantage in the moral debasement of their fellows\xe2\x80\x94the nearer would the\r\nFlorentine people approach the character of a pure community, worthy to\r\nlead the way in the renovation of the Church and the world. And Fra\r\nGirolamo\xe2\x80\x99s mind never stopped short of that sublimest end: the objects\r\ntowards which he felt himself working had always the same moral\r\nmagnificence. He had no private malice\xe2\x80\x94he sought no petty\r\ngratification. Even in the last terrible days, when ignominy, torture,\r\nand the fear of torture, had laid bare every hidden weakness of his\r\nsoul, he could say to his importunate judges: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not wonder if it\r\nseems to you that I have told but few things; for my purposes were few\r\nand great.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9cSe vi pare che io abbia detto poche cose, non ve ne maravigliate,\r\n perch\xc3\xa8 le mie cose erano poche e grandi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nAriadne discrowns herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was more than three weeks before the contents of the library were\r\nall packed and carried away. And Romola, instead of shutting her eyes\r\nand ears, had watched the process. The exhaustion consequent on violent\r\nemotion is apt to bring a dreamy disbelief in the reality of its cause;\r\nand in the evening, when the workmen were gone, Romola took her\r\nhand-lamp and walked slowly round amongst the confusion of straw and\r\nwooden cases, pausing at every vacant pedestal, every well-known object\r\nlaid prostrate, with a sort of bitter desire to assure herself that\r\nthere was a sufficient reason why her love was gone and the world was\r\nbarren for her. And still, as the evenings came, she went and went\r\nagain; no longer to assure herself, but because this vivifying of pain\r\nand despair about her father\xe2\x80\x99s memory was the strongest life left to\r\nher affections. On the 23rd of December, she knew that the last\r\npackages were going. She ran to the loggia at the top of the house that\r\nshe might not lose the last pang of seeing the slow wheels move across\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nIt was a cloudy day, and nearing dusk. Arno ran dark and shivering; the\r\nhills were mournful; and Florence with its girdling stone towers had\r\nthat silent, tomb-like look, which unbroken shadow gives to a city seen\r\nfrom above. Santa Croce, where her father lay, was dark amidst that\r\ndarkness, and slowly crawling over the bridge, and slowly vanishing up\r\nthe narrow street, was the white load, like a cruel, deliberate Fate\r\ncarrying away her father\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong hope to bury it in an unmarked\r\ngrave. Romola felt less that she was seeing this herself than that her\r\nfather was conscious of it as he lay helpless under the imprisoning\r\nstones, where her hand could not reach his to tell him that he was not\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nShe stood still even after the load had disappeared, heedless of the\r\ncold, and soothed by the gloom which seemed to cover her like a\r\nmourning garment and shut out the discord of joy. When suddenly the\r\ngreat bell in the palace-tower rang out a mighty peal: not the\r\nhammer-sound of alarm, but an agitated peal of triumph; and one after\r\nanother every other bell in every other tower seemed to catch the\r\nvibration and join the chorus. And, as the chorus swelled and swelled\r\ntill the air seemed made of sound\xe2\x80\x94little flames, vibrating too, as if\r\nthe sound had caught fire, burst out between the turrets of the palace\r\nand on the girdling towers.\r\n\r\nThat sudden clang, that leaping light, fell on Romola like sharp\r\nwounds. They were the triumph of demons at the success of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntreachery, and the desolation of her life. Little more than three weeks\r\nago she had been intoxicated with the sound of those very bells; and in\r\nthe gladness of Florence, she had heard a prophecy of her own gladness.\r\nBut now the general joy seemed cruel to her: she stood aloof from that\r\ncommon life\xe2\x80\x94that Florence which was flinging out its loud exultation to\r\nstun the ears of sorrow and loneliness. She could never join hands with\r\ngladness again, but only with those whom it was in the hard nature of\r\ngladness to forget. And in her bitterness she felt that all rejoicing\r\nwas mockery. Men shouted paeans with their souls full of heaviness, and\r\nthen looked in their neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 faces to see if there was really such\r\na thing as joy. Romola had lost her belief in the happiness she had\r\nonce thirsted for: it was a hateful, smiling, soft-handed thing, with a\r\nnarrow, selfish heart.\r\n\r\nShe ran down from the loggia, with her hands pressed against her ears,\r\nand was hurrying across the antechamber, when she was startled by\r\nunexpectedly meeting her husband, who was coming to seek her.\r\n\r\nHis step was elastic, and there was a radiance of satisfaction about\r\nhim not quite usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the noise was a little too much for you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said; for Romola,\r\nas she started at the sight of him, had pressed her hands all the\r\ncloser against her ears. He took her gently by the wrist, and drew her\r\narm within his, leading her into the saloon surrounded with the dancing\r\nnymphs and fauns, and then went on speaking: \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence is gone quite\r\nmad at getting its Great Council, which is to put an end to all the\r\nevils under the sun; especially to the vice of merriment. You may well\r\nlook stunned, my Romola, and you are cold. You must not stay so late\r\nunder that windy loggia without wrappings. I was coming to tell you\r\nthat I am suddenly called to Rome about some learned business for\r\nBernardo Rucellai. I am going away immediately, for I am to join my\r\nparty at San Gaggio to-night, that we may start early in the morning. I\r\nneed give you no trouble; I have had my packages made already. It will\r\nnot be very long before I am back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew he had nothing to expect from her but quiet endurance of what\r\nhe said and did. He could not even venture to kiss her brow this\r\nevening, but just pressed her hand to his lips, and left her. Tito felt\r\nthat Romola was a more unforgiving woman than he had imagined; her love\r\nwas not that sweet clinging instinct, stronger than all judgments,\r\nwhich, he began to see now, made the great charm of a wife. Still, this\r\npetrified coldness was better than a passionate, futile opposition. Her\r\npride and capability of seeing where resistance was useless had their\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nBut when the door had closed on Tito, Romola lost the look of cold\r\nimmobility which came over her like an inevitable frost whenever he\r\napproached her. Inwardly she was very far from being in a state of\r\nquiet endurance, and the days that had passed since the scene which had\r\ndivided her from Tito had been days of active planning and preparation\r\nfor the fulfilment of a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she did now was to call old Maso to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaso,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a decided tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwe take our journey to-morrow\r\nmorning. We shall be able now to overtake that first convoy of cloth,\r\nwhile they are waiting at San Piero. See about the two mules to-night,\r\nand be ready to set off with them at break of day, and wait for me at\r\nTrespiano.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe meant to take Maso with her as far as Bologna, and then send him\r\nback with letters to her godfather and Tito, telling them that she was\r\ngone and never meant to return. She had planned her departure so that\r\nits secrecy might be perfect, and her broken love and life be hidden\r\naway unscanned by vulgar eyes. Bernardo del Nero had been absent at his\r\nvilla, willing to escape from political suspicions to his favourite\r\noccupation of attending to his land, and she had paid him the debt\r\nwithout a personal interview. He did not even know that the library was\r\nsold, and was left to conjecture that some sudden piece of good fortune\r\nhad enabled Tito to raise this sum of money. Maso had been taken into\r\nher confidence only so far that he knew her intended journey was a\r\nsecret; and to do just what she told him was the thing he cared most\r\nfor in his withered wintry age.\r\n\r\nRomola did not mean to go to bed that night. When she had fastened the\r\ndoor she took her taper to the carved and painted chest which contained\r\nher wedding-clothes. The white silk and gold lay there, the long white\r\nveil and the circlet of pearls. A great sob rose as she looked at them:\r\nthey seemed the shroud of her dead happiness. In a tiny gold loop of\r\nthe circlet a sugar-plum had lodged\xe2\x80\x94a pink hailstone from the shower of\r\nsweets: Tito had detected it first, and had said that it should always\r\nremain there. At certain moments\xe2\x80\x94and this was one of them\xe2\x80\x94Romola was\r\ncarried, by a sudden wave of memory, back again into the time of\r\nperfect trust, and felt again the presence of the husband whose love\r\nmade the world as fresh and wonderful to her as to a little child that\r\nsits in stillness among the sunny flowers: heard the gentle tones and\r\nsaw the soft eyes without any lie in them, and breathed again that\r\nlarge freedom of the soul which comes from the faith that the being who\r\nis nearest to us is greater than ourselves. And in those brief moments\r\nthe tears always rose: the woman\xe2\x80\x99s lovingness felt something akin to\r\nwhat the bereaved mother feels when the tiny fingers seem to lie warm\r\non her bosom, and yet are marble to her lips as she bends over the\r\nsilent bed.\r\n\r\nBut there was something else lying in the chest besides the\r\nwedding-clothes: it was something dark and coarse, rolled up in a close\r\nbundle. She turned away her eyes from the white and gold to the dark\r\nbundle, and as her hands touched the serge, her tears began to be\r\nchecked. That coarse roughness recalled her fully to the present, from\r\nwhich love and delight were gone. She unfastened the thick white cord\r\nand spread the bundle out on the table. It was the grey serge dress of\r\na sister belonging to the third order of Saint Francis, living in the\r\nworld but especially devoted to deeds of piety\xe2\x80\x94a personage whom the\r\nFlorentines were accustomed to call a Pinzochera. Romola was going to\r\nput on this dress as a disguise, and she determined to put it on at\r\nonce, so that, if she needed sleep before the morning, she might wake\r\nup in perfect readiness to be gone. She put off her black garment, and\r\nas she thrust her soft white arms into the harsh sleeves of the serge\r\nmantle and felt the hard girdle of rope hurt her fingers as she tied\r\nit, she courted those rude sensations: they were in keeping with her\r\nnew scorn of that thing called pleasure which made men base\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ndexterous contrivance for selfish ease, that shrinking from endurance\r\nand strain, when others were bowing beneath burdens too heavy for them,\r\nwhich now made one image with her husband. Then she gathered her long\r\nhair together, drew it away tight from her face, bound it in a great\r\nhard knot at the back of her head, and taking a square piece of black\r\nsilk, tied it in the fashion of a kerchief close across her head and\r\nunder her chin; and over that she drew the cowl. She lifted the candle\r\nto the mirror. Surely her disguise would be complete to any one who had\r\nnot lived very near to her. To herself she looked strangely like her\r\nbrother Dino: the full oval of the cheek had only to be wasted; the\r\neyes, already sad, had only to become a little sunken. Was she getting\r\nmore like him in anything else? Only in this, that she understood now\r\nhow men could be prompted to rush away for ever from earthly delights,\r\nhow they could be prompted to dwell on images of sorrow rather than of\r\nbeauty and joy.\r\n\r\nBut she did not linger at the mirror: she set about collecting and\r\npacking all the relics of her father and mother that were too large to\r\nbe carried in her small travelling-wallet. They were all to be put in\r\nthe chest along with her wedding-clothes, and the chest was to be\r\ncommitted to her godfather when she was safely gone. First she laid in\r\nthe portraits; then one by one every little thing that had a sacred\r\nmemory clinging to it was put into her wallet or into the chest.\r\n\r\nShe paused. There was still something else to be stript away from her,\r\nbelonging to that past on which she was going to turn her back for\r\never. She put her thumb and her forefinger to her betrothal ring; but\r\nthey rested there, without drawing it off. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s mind had been\r\nrushing with an impetuous current towards this act, for which she was\r\npreparing: the act of quitting a husband who had disappointed all her\r\ntrust, the act of breaking an outward tie that no longer represented\r\nthe inward bond of love. But that force of outward symbols by which our\r\nactive life is knit together so as to make an inexorable external\r\nidentity for us, not to be shaken by our wavering consciousness, gave a\r\nstrange effect to this simple movement towards taking off her ring\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmovement which was but a small sequence of her energetic resolution. It\r\nbrought a vague but arresting sense that she was somehow violently\r\nrending her life in two: a presentiment that the strong impulse which\r\nhad seemed to exclude doubt and make her path clear might after all be\r\nblindness, and that there was something in human bonds which must\r\nprevent them from being broken with the breaking of illusions.\r\n\r\nIf that beloved Tito who had placed the betrothal ring on her finger\r\nwas not in any valid sense the same Tito whom she had ceased to love,\r\nwhy should she return to him the sign of their union, and not rather\r\nretain it as a memorial? And this act, which came as a palpable\r\ndemonstration of her own and his identity, had a power unexplained to\r\nherself, of shaking Romola. It is the way with half the truth amidst\r\nwhich we live, that it only haunts us and makes dull pulsations that\r\nare never born into sound. But there was a passionate voice speaking\r\nwithin her that presently nullified all such muffled murmurs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be! I cannot be subject to him. He is false. I shrink from\r\nhim. I despise him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe snatched the ring from her finger and laid it on the table against\r\nthe pen with which she meant to write. Again she felt that there could\r\nbe no law for her but the law of her affections. That tenderness and\r\nkeen fellow-feeling for the near and the loved which are the main\r\noutgrowth of the affections, had made the religion of her life: they\r\nhad made her patient in spite of natural impetuosity: they would have\r\nsufficed to make her heroic. But now all that strength was gone, or,\r\nrather, it was converted into the strength of repulsion. She had\r\nrecoiled from Tito in proportion to the energy of that young belief and\r\nlove which he had disappointed, of that lifelong devotion to her father\r\nagainst which he had committed an irredeemable offence. And it seemed\r\nas if all motive had slipped away from her, except the indignation and\r\nscorn that made her tear herself asunder from him.\r\n\r\nShe was not acting after any precedent, or obeying any adopted maxims.\r\nThe grand severity of the stoical philosophy in which her father had\r\ntaken care to instruct her, was familiar enough to her ears and lips,\r\nand its lofty spirit had raised certain echoes within her; but she had\r\nnever used it, never needed it as a rule of life. She had endured and\r\nforborne because she loved: maxims which told her to feel less, and not\r\nto cling close lest the onward course of great Nature should jar her,\r\nhad been as powerless on her tenderness as they had been on her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s yearning for just fame. She had appropriated no theories: she\r\nhad simply felt strong in the strength of affection, and life without\r\nthat energy came to her as an entirely new problem.\r\n\r\nShe was going to solve the problem in a way that seemed to her very\r\nsimple. Her mind had never yet bowed to any obligation apart from\r\npersonal love and reverence; she had no keen sense of any other human\r\nrelations, and all she had to obey now was the instinct to sever\r\nherself from the man she loved no longer.\r\n\r\nYet the unswerving resolution was accompanied with continually varying\r\nphases of anguish. And now that the active preparation for her\r\ndeparture was almost finished, she lingered: she deferred writing the\r\nirrevocable words of parting from all her little world. The emotions of\r\nthe past weeks seemed to rush in again with cruel hurry, and take\r\npossession even of her limbs. She was going to write, and her hand\r\nfell. Bitter tears came now at the delusion which had blighted her\r\nyoung years, tears very different from the sob of remembered happiness\r\nwith which she had looked at the circlet of pearls and the pink\r\nhailstone. And now she felt a tingling shame at the words of ignominy\r\nshe had cast, at Tito\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHave you robbed some one else who is _not_\r\ndead?\xe2\x80\x9d To have had such words wrung from her\xe2\x80\x94to have uttered them to\r\nher husband seemed a degradation of her whole life. Hard speech between\r\nthose who have loved is hideous in the memory, like the sight of\r\ngreatness and beauty sunk into vice and rags.\r\n\r\nThat heart-cutting comparison of the present with the past urged itself\r\nupon Romola till it even transformed itself into wretched sensations:\r\nshe seemed benumbed to everything but inward throbbings, and began to\r\nfeel the need of some hard contact. She drew her hands tight along the\r\nharsh knotted cord that hung from her waist. She started to her feet\r\nand seized the rough lid of the chest: there was nothing else to go in?\r\nNo. She closed the lid, pressing her hand upon the rough carving, and\r\nlocked it.\r\n\r\nThen she remembered that she had still to complete her equipment as a\r\nPinzochera. The large leather purse or scarsella, with small coin in\r\nit, had to be hung on the cord at her waist (her florins and small\r\njewels, presents from her godfather and cousin Brigida, were safely\r\nfastened within her serge mantle)\xe2\x80\x94and on the other side must hang the\r\nrosary.\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to Romola, as she hung that rosary by her side, that\r\nsomething else besides the mere garb would perhaps be necessary to\r\nenable her to pass as a Pinzochera, and that her whole air and\r\nexpression were as little as possible like those of a sister whose\r\neyelids were used to be bent, and whose lips were used to move in\r\nsilent iteration. Her inexperience prevented her from picturing distant\r\ndetails, and it helped her proud courage in shutting out any foreboding\r\nof danger and insult. She did not know that any Florentine woman had\r\never done exactly what she was going to do: unhappy wives often took\r\nrefuge with their friends, or in the cloister, she knew, but both those\r\ncourses were impossible to her; she had invented a lot for herself\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ngo to the most learned woman in the world, Cassandra Fedele, at Venice,\r\nand ask her how an instructed woman could support herself in a lonely\r\nlife there.\r\n\r\nShe was not daunted by the practical difficulties in the way or the\r\ndark uncertainty at the end. Her life could never be happy any more,\r\nbut it must not, could not, be ignoble. And by a pathetic mixture of\r\nchildish romance with her woman\xe2\x80\x99s trials, the philosophy which had\r\nnothing to do with this great decisive deed of hers had its place in\r\nher imagination of the future: so far as she conceived her solitary\r\nloveless life at all, she saw it animated by a proud stoical heroism,\r\nand by an indistinct but strong purpose of labour, that she might be\r\nwise enough to write something which would rescue her father\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nfrom oblivion. After all, she was only a young girl\xe2\x80\x94this poor Romola,\r\nwho had found herself at the end of her joys.\r\n\r\nThere were other things yet to be done. There was a small key in a\r\ncasket on the table\xe2\x80\x94but now Romola perceived that her taper was dying\r\nout, and she had forgotten to provide herself with any other light. In\r\na few moments the room was in total darkness. Feeling her way to the\r\nnearest chair, she sat down to wait for the morning.\r\n\r\nHer purpose in seeking the key had called up certain memories which had\r\ncome back upon her during the past week with the new vividness that\r\nremembered words always have for us when we have learned to give them a\r\nnew meaning. Since the shock of the revelation which had seemed to\r\ndivide her for ever from Tito, that last interview with Dino had never\r\nbeen for many hours together out of her mind. And it solicited her all\r\nthe more, because while its remembered images pressed upon her almost\r\nwith the imperious force of sensations, they raised struggling thoughts\r\nwhich resisted their influence. She could not prevent herself from\r\nhearing inwardly the dying prophetic voice saying again and again,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nman whose face was a blank loosed thy hand and departed; and as he\r\nwent, I could see his face, and it was the face of the great Tempter...\r\nAnd thou, Romola, didst wring thy hands and seek for water, and there\r\nwas none... and the plain was bare and stony again, and thou wast alone\r\nin the midst of it. And then it seemed that the night fell, and I saw\r\nno more.\xe2\x80\x9d She could not prevent herself from dwelling with a sort of\r\nagonised fascination on the wasted face; on the straining gaze at the\r\ncrucifix; on the awe which had compelled her to kneel; on the last\r\nbroken words and then the unbroken silence\xe2\x80\x94on all the details of the\r\ndeath-scene, which had seemed like a sudden opening into a world apart\r\nfrom that of her lifelong knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut her mind was roused to resistance of impressions that, from being\r\nobvious phantoms, seemed to be getting solid in the daylight. As a\r\nstrong body struggles against fumes with the more violence when they\r\nbegin to be stifling, a strong soul struggles against phantasies with\r\nall the more alarmed energy when they threaten to govern in the place\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\nWhat had the words of that vision to do with her real sorrows? That\r\nfitting of certain words was a mere chance; the rest was all vague\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nthose words themselves were vague; they were determined by nothing but\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s memories and beliefs. He believed there was something\r\nfatal in pagan learning; he believed that celibacy was more holy than\r\nmarriage; he remembered their home, and all the objects in the library;\r\nand of these threads the vision was woven. What reasonable warrant\r\ncould she have had for believing in such a vision and acting on it?\r\nNone. True as the voice of foreboding had proved, Romola saw with\r\nunshaken conviction that to have renounced Tito in obedience to a\r\nwarning like that, would have been meagre-hearted folly. Her trust had\r\nbeen delusive, but she would have chosen over again to have acted on it\r\nrather than be a creature led by phantoms and disjointed whispers in a\r\nworld where there was the large music of reasonable speech, and the\r\nwarm grasp of living hands.\r\n\r\nBut the persistent presence of these memories, linking themselves in\r\nher imagination with her actual lot, gave her a glimpse of\r\nunderstanding into the lives which had before lain utterly aloof from\r\nher sympathy\xe2\x80\x94the lives of the men and women who were led by such inward\r\nimages and voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they were only a little stronger in me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould lose the sense of what that vision really was, and take it for a\r\nprophetic light. I might in time get to be a seer of visions myself,\r\nlike the Suora Maddalena, and Camilla Rucellai, and the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola shuddered at the possibility. All the instruction, all the main\r\ninfluences of her life had gone to fortify her scorn of that sickly\r\nsuperstition which led men and women, with eyes too weak for the\r\ndaylight, to sit in dark swamps and try to read human destiny by the\r\nchance flame of wandering vapours.\r\n\r\nAnd yet she was conscious of something deeper than that coincidence of\r\nwords which made the parting contact with her dying brother live anew\r\nin her mind, and gave a new sisterhood to the wasted face. If there\r\nwere much more of such experience as his in the world, she would like\r\nto understand it\xe2\x80\x94would even like to learn the thoughts of men who sank\r\nin ecstasy before the pictured agonies of martyrdom. There seemed to be\r\nsomething more than madness in that supreme fellowship with suffering.\r\nThe springs were all dried up around her; she wondered what other\r\nwaters there were at which men drank and found strength in the desert.\r\nAnd those moments in the Duomo when she had sobbed with a mysterious\r\nmingling of rapture and pain, while Fra Girolamo offered himself a\r\nwilling sacrifice for the people, came back to her as if they had been\r\na transient taste of some such far-off fountain. But again she shrank\r\nfrom impressions that were alluring her within the sphere of visions\r\nand narrow fears which compelled men to outrage natural affections as\r\nDino had done.\r\n\r\nThis was the tangled web that Romola had in her mind as she sat weary\r\nin the darkness. No radiant angel came across the gloom with a clear\r\nmessage for her. In those times, as now, there were human beings who\r\nnever saw angels or heard perfectly clear messages. Such truth as came\r\nto them was brought confusedly in the voices and deeds of men not at\r\nall like the seraphs of unfailing wing and piercing vision\xe2\x80\x94men who\r\nbelieved falsities as well as truths, and did the wrong as well as the\r\nright. The helping hands stretched out to them were the hands of men\r\nwho stumbled and often saw dimly, so that these beings unvisited by\r\nangels had no other choice than to grasp that stumbling guidance along\r\nthe path of reliance and action which is the path of life, or else to\r\npause in loneliness and disbelief, which is no path, but the arrest of\r\ninaction and death.\r\n\r\nAnd so Romola, seeing no ray across the darkness, and heavy with\r\nconflict that changed nothing, sank at last to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nThe Tabernacle Unlocked.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomola was waked by a tap at the door. The cold light of early morning\r\nwas in the room, and Maso was come for the travelling-wallet. The old\r\nman could not help starting when she opened the door, and showed him,\r\ninstead of the graceful outline he had been used to, crowned with the\r\nbrightness of her hair, the thick folds of the grey mantle and the pale\r\nface shadowed by the dark cowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well, Maso,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, trying to speak in the calmest voice,\r\nand make the old man easy. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the wallet quite ready. You will go\r\non quietly, and I shall not be far behind you. When you get out of the\r\ngates you may go more slowly, for I shall perhaps join you before you\r\nget to Trespiano.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed the door behind him, and then put her hand on the key which\r\nshe had taken from the casket the last thing in the night. It was the\r\noriginal key of the little painted tabernacle: Tito had forgotten to\r\ndrown it in the Arno, and it had lodged, as such small things will, in\r\nthe corner of the embroidered scarsella which he wore with the purple\r\ntunic. One day, long after their marriage, Romola had found it there,\r\nand had put it by, without using it, but with a sense of satisfaction\r\nthat the key was within reach. The cabinet on which the tabernacle\r\nstood had been moved to the side of the room, close to one of the\r\nwindows, where the pale morning light fell upon it so as to make the\r\npainted forms discernible enough to Romola, who knew them well,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ntriumphant Bacchus, with his clusters and his vine-clad spear, clasping\r\nthe crowned Ariadne; the Loves showering roses, the wreathed vessel,\r\nthe cunning-eyed dolphins, and the rippled sea: all encircled by a\r\nflowery border, like a bower of paradise. Romola looked at the familiar\r\nimages with new bitterness and repulsion: they seemed a more pitiable\r\nmockery than ever on this chill morning, when she had waked up to\r\nwander in loneliness. They had been no tomb of sorrow, but a lying\r\nscreen. Foolish Ariadne! with her gaze of love, as if that bright face,\r\nwith its hyacinthine curls like tendrils among the vines, held the deep\r\nsecret of her life!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAriadne is wonderfully transformed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cShe would look\r\nstrange among the vines and the roses now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the mirror, and looked at herself once more. But the sight\r\nwas so startling in this morning light that she laid it down again,\r\nwith a sense of shrinking almost as strong as that with which she had\r\nturned from the joyous Ariadne. The recognition of her own face, with\r\nthe cowl about it, brought back the dread lest she should be drawn at\r\nlast into fellowship with some wretched superstition\xe2\x80\x94into the company\r\nof the howling fanatics and weeping nuns who had been her contempt from\r\nchildhood till now. She thrust the key into the tabernacle hurriedly:\r\nhurriedly she opened it, and took out the crucifix, without looking at\r\nit; then, with trembling fingers, she passed a cord through the little\r\nring, hung the crucifix round her neck, and hid it in the bosom of her\r\nmantle. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Dino\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. Still there were the\r\nletters to be written which Maso was to carry back from Bologna. They\r\nwere very brief. The first said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, my love for you is dead; and therefore, so far as I was yours, I\r\ntoo am dead. Do not try to put in force any laws for the sake of\r\nfetching me back: that would bring you no happiness. The Romola you\r\nmarried can never return. I need explain nothing to you after the words\r\nI uttered to you the last time we spoke long together. If you supposed\r\nthem to be words of transient anger, you will know now that they were\r\nthe sign of an irreversible change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will fulfil my wish that my bridal chest should be sent to\r\nmy godfather, who gave it me. It contains my wedding-clothes and the\r\nportraits and other relics of my father and mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe folded the ring inside this letter, and wrote Tito\xe2\x80\x99s name outside.\r\nThe next letter was to Bernardo del Nero:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Godfather,\xe2\x80\x94If I could have been any good to your life by\r\nstaying I would not have gone away to a distance. But now I am gone. Do\r\nnot ask the reason; and if you love my father, try to prevent any one\r\nfrom seeking me. I could not bear my life at Florence. I cannot bear to\r\ntell any one why. Help to cover my lot in silence. I have asked that my\r\nbridal chest should be sent to you: when you open it, you will know the\r\nreason. Please to give all the things that were my mother\xe2\x80\x99s to my\r\ncousin Brigida, and ask her to forgive me for not saying any words of\r\nparting to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, my second father. The best thing I have in life is still to\r\nremember your goodness and be grateful to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola put the letters, along with the crucifix, within the bosom of\r\nher mantle, and then felt that everything was done. She was ready now\r\nto depart.\r\n\r\nNo one was stirring in the house, and she went almost as quietly as a\r\ngrey phantom down the stairs and into the silent street. Her heart was\r\npalpitating violently, yet she enjoyed the sense of her firm tread on\r\nthe broad flags\xe2\x80\x94of the swift movement, which was like a chained-up\r\nresolution set free at last. The anxiety to carry out her act, and the\r\ndread of any obstacle, averted sorrow; and as she reached the Ponte\r\nRubaconte, she felt less that Santa Croce was in her sight than that\r\nthe yellow streak of morning which parted the grey was getting broader\r\nand broader, and that, unless she hastened her steps, she should have\r\nto encounter faces.\r\n\r\nHer simplest road was to go right on to the Borgo Pinti, and then along\r\nby the walls to the Porta San Gallo, from which she must leave the\r\ncity, and this road carried her by the Piazza di Santa Croce. But she\r\nwalked as steadily and rapidly as ever through the piazza, not trusting\r\nherself to look towards the church. The thought that any eyes might be\r\nturned on her with a look of curiosity and recognition, and that\r\nindifferent minds might be set speculating on her private sorrows, made\r\nRomola shrink physically as from the imagination of torture. She felt\r\ndegraded even by that act of her husband from which she was helplessly\r\nsuffering. But there was no sign that any eyes looked forth from\r\nwindows to notice this tall grey sister, with the firm step, and proud\r\nattitude of the cowled head. Her road lay aloof from the stir of early\r\ntraffic, and when she reached the Porta San Gallo, it was easy to pass\r\nwhile a dispute was going forward about the toll for panniers of eggs\r\nand market produce which were just entering.\r\n\r\nOut! Once past the houses of the Borgo, she would be beyond the last\r\nfringe of Florence, the sky would be broad above her, and she would\r\nhave entered on her new life\xe2\x80\x94a life of loneliness and endurance, but of\r\nfreedom. She had been strong enough to snap asunder the bonds she had\r\naccepted in blind faith: whatever befell her, she would no more feel\r\nthe breath of soft hated lips warm upon her cheek, no longer feel the\r\nbreath of an odious mind stifling her own. The bare wintry morning, the\r\nchill air, were welcome in their severity: the leafless trees, the\r\nsombre hills, were not haunted by the gods of beauty and joy, whose\r\nworship she had forsaken for ever.\r\n\r\nBut presently the light burst forth with sudden strength, and shadows\r\nwere thrown across the road. It seemed that the sun was going to chase\r\naway the greyness. The light is perhaps never felt more strongly as a\r\ndivine presence stirring all those inarticulate sensibilities which are\r\nour deepest life, than in these moments when it instantaneously awakens\r\nthe shadows. A certain awe which inevitably accompanied this most\r\nmomentous act of her life became a more conscious element in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeling as she found herself in the sudden presence of the impalpable\r\ngolden glory and the long shadow of herself that was not to be escaped.\r\nHitherto she had met no one but an occasional contadino with mules, and\r\nthe many turnings of the road on the level prevented her from seeing\r\nthat Maso was not very far ahead of her. But when she had passed Pietra\r\nand was on rising ground, she lifted up the hanging roof of her cowl\r\nand looked eagerly before her.\r\n\r\nThe cowl was dropped again immediately. She had seen, not Maso, but\xe2\x80\x94two\r\nmonks, who were approaching within a few yards of her. The edge of her\r\ncowl making a pent-house on her brow had shut out the objects above the\r\nlevel of her eyes, and for the last few moments she had been looking at\r\nnothing but the brightness on the path and at her own shadow, tall and\r\nshrouded like a dread spectre.\r\n\r\nShe wished now that she had not looked up. Her disguise made her\r\nespecially dislike to encounter monks: they might expect some pious\r\npasswords of which she knew nothing, and she walked along with a\r\ncareful appearance of unconsciousness till she had seen the skirts of\r\nthe black mantles pass by her. The encounter had made her heart beat\r\ndisagreeably, for Romola had an uneasiness in her religious disguise, a\r\nshame at this studied concealment, which was made more distinct by a\r\nspecial effort to appear unconscious under actual glances.\r\n\r\nBut the black skirts would be gone the faster because they were going\r\ndown-hill; and seeing a great flat stone against a cypress that rose\r\nfrom a projecting green bank, she yielded to the desire which the\r\nslight shock had given her, to sit down and rest.\r\n\r\nShe turned her back on Florence, not meaning to look at it till the\r\nmonks were quite out of sight, and raising the edge of her cowl again\r\nwhen she had seated herself, she discerned Maso and the mules at a\r\ndistance where it was not hopeless for her to overtake them, as the old\r\nman would probably linger in expectation of her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she might pause a little. She was free and alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nThe Black Marks become Magical.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat journey of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s to Rome, which had removed many difficulties\r\nfrom Romola\xe2\x80\x99s departure, had been resolved on quite suddenly, at a\r\nsupper, only the evening before.\r\n\r\nTito had set out towards that supper with agreeable expectations. The\r\nmeats were likely to be delicate, the wines choice, the company\r\ndistinguished; for the place of entertainment was the Selva or Orto de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nRucellai, or, as we should say, the Rucellai Gardens; and the host,\r\nBernardo Rucellai, was quite a typical Florentine grandee. Even his\r\nfamily name has a significance which is prettily symbolic: properly\r\nunderstood, it may bring before us a little lichen, popularly named\r\n_orcella_ or _roccella_, which grows on the rocks of Greek isles and in\r\nthe Canaries; and having drunk a great deal of light into its little\r\nstems and button-heads, will, under certain circumstances, give it out\r\nagain as a reddish purple dye, very grateful to the eyes of men. By\r\nbringing the excellent secret of this dye, called _oricello_, from the\r\nLevant to Florence, a certain merchant, who lived nearly a hundred\r\nyears before our Bernardo\xe2\x80\x99s time, won for himself and his descendants\r\nmuch wealth, and the pleasantly-suggestive surname of Oricellari, or\r\nRoccellari, which on Tuscan tongues speedily became Rucellai.\r\n\r\nAnd our Bernardo, who stands out more prominently than the rest on this\r\npurple background, had added all sorts of distinction to the family\r\nname: he had married the sister of Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, and had had the\r\nmost splendid wedding in the memory of Florentine upholstery; and for\r\nthese and other virtues he had been sent on embassies to France and\r\nVenice, and had been chosen Gonfaloniere; he had not only built himself\r\na fine palace, but had finished putting the black and white marble\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade to the church of Santa Maria Novella; he had planted a garden\r\nwith rare trees, and had made it classic ground by receiving within it\r\nthe meetings of the Platonic Academy, orphaned by the death of Lorenzo;\r\nhe had written an excellent, learned book, of a new topographical sort,\r\nabout ancient Rome; he had collected antiquities; he had a pure\r\nLatinity. The simplest account of him, one sees, reads like a laudatory\r\nepitaph, at the end of which the Greek and Ausonian Muses might be\r\nconfidently requested to tear their hair, and Nature to desist from any\r\nsecond attempt to combine so many virtues with one set of viscera.\r\n\r\nHis invitation had been conveyed to Tito through Lorenzo Tornabuoni,\r\nwith an emphasis which would have suggested that the object of the\r\ngathering was political, even if the public questions of the time had\r\nbeen less absorbing. As it was, Tito felt sure that some party purposes\r\nwere to be furthered by the excellent flavours of stewed fish and old\r\nGreek wine; for Bernardo Rucellai was not simply an influential\r\npersonage, he was one of the elect Twenty who for three weeks had held\r\nthe reins of Florence. This assurance put Tito in the best spirits as\r\nhe made his way to the Via della Scala, where the classic garden was to\r\nbe found: without it, he might have had some uneasy speculation as to\r\nwhether the high company he would have the honour of meeting was likely\r\nto be dull as well as distinguished; for he had had experience of\r\nvarious dull suppers even in the Rucellai gardens, and especially of\r\nthe dull philosophic sort, wherein he had not only been called upon to\r\naccept an entire scheme of the universe (which would have been easy to\r\nhim), but to listen to an exposition of the same, from the origin of\r\nthings to their complete ripeness in the tractate of the philosopher\r\nthen speaking.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark evening, and it was only when Tito crossed the occasional\r\nlight of a lamp suspended before an image of the Virgin, that the\r\noutline of his figure was discernible enough for recognition. At such\r\nmoments any one caring to watch his passage from one of these lights to\r\nanother might have observed that the tall and graceful personage with\r\nthe mantle folded round him was followed constantly by a very different\r\nform, thickset and elderly, in a serge tunic and felt hat. The\r\nconjunction might have been taken for mere chance, since there were\r\nmany passengers along the streets at this hour. But when Tito stopped\r\nat the gate of the Rucellai gardens, the figure behind stopped too. The\r\n_sportello_, or smaller door of the gate, was already being held open\r\nby the servant, who, in the distraction of attending to some question,\r\nhad not yet closed it since the last arrival, and Tito turned in\r\nrapidly, giving his name to the servant, and passing on between the\r\nevergreen bushes that shone like metal in the torchlight. The follower\r\nturned in too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name?\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaldassarre Calvo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the immediate answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not a guest; the guests have all passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI belong to Tito Melema, who has just gone in. I am to wait in the\r\ngardens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI had orders to admit only guests. Are you a\r\nservant of Messer Tito?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, friend, I am not a servant; I am a scholar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are men to whom you need only say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a buffalo,\xe2\x80\x9d in a certain\r\ntone of quiet confidence, and they will let you pass. The porter gave\r\nway at once, Baldassarre entered, and heard the door closed and chained\r\nbehind him, as he too disappeared among the shining bushes.\r\n\r\nThose ready and firm answers argued a great change in Baldassarre since\r\nthe last meeting face to face with Tito, when the dagger broke in two.\r\n\r\nThe change had declared itself in a startling way.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the shadow of Tito passed in front of the hovel as\r\nhe departed homeward, Baldassarre was sitting in that state of\r\nafter-tremor known to every one who is liable to great outbursts of\r\npassion: a state in which physical powerlessness is sometimes\r\naccompanied by an exceptional lucidity of thought, as if that\r\ndisengagement of excited passion had carried away a fire-mist and left\r\nclearness behind it. He felt unable to rise and walk away just yet; his\r\nlimbs seemed benumbed; he was cold, and his hands shook. But in that\r\nbodily helplessness he sat surrounded, not by the habitual dimness and\r\nvanishing shadows, but by the clear images of the past; he was living\r\nagain in an unbroken course through that life which seemed a long\r\npreparation for the taste of bitterness.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes he was too thoroughly absorbed by the images to\r\nreflect on the fact that he saw them, and note the fact as a change.\r\nBut when that sudden clearness had travelled through the distance, and\r\ncame at last to rest on the scene just gone by, he felt fully where he\r\nwas: he remembered Monna Lisa and Tessa. Ah! _he_ then was the\r\nmysterious husband; he who had another wife in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi. It\r\nwas time to pick up the broken dagger and go\xe2\x80\x94go and leave no trace of\r\nhimself; for to hide his feebleness seemed the thing most like power\r\nthat was left to him. He leaned to take up the fragments of the dagger;\r\nthen he turned towards the book which lay open at his side. It was a\r\nfine large manuscript, an odd volume of Pausanias. The moonlight was\r\nupon it, and he could see the large letters at the head of the page:\r\n\r\n\xce\x9c\xce\x95\xce\xa3\xce\xa3\xce\x95\xce\x9d\xce\x99\xce\x9a\xce\x91. \xce\x9a\xce\x92\xe2\x80\xb2.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn old days he had known Pausanias familiarly; yet an hour or two ago\r\nhe had been looking hopelessly at that page, and it had suggested no\r\nmore meaning to him than if the letters had been black weather-marks on\r\na wall; but at this moment they were once more the magic signs that\r\nconjure up a world. That moonbeam falling on the letters had raised\r\nMessenia before him, and its struggle against the Spartan oppression.\r\n\r\nHe snatched up the book, but the light was too pale for him to read\r\nfurther by. No matter: he knew that chapter; he read inwardly. He saw\r\nthe stoning of the traitor Aristocrates\xe2\x80\x94stoned by a whole people, who\r\ncast him out from their borders to lie unburied, and set up a pillar\r\nwith verses upon it telling how Time had brought home justice to the\r\nunjust. The words arose within him, and stirred innumerable vibrations\r\nof memory. He forgot that he was old: he could almost have shouted. The\r\nlight was come again, mother of knowledge and joy! In that exultation\r\nhis limbs recovered their strength: he started up with his broken\r\ndagger and book, and went out under the broad moonlight.\r\n\r\nIt was a nipping frosty air, but Baldassarre could feel no chill\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nonly felt the glow of conscious power. He walked about and paused on\r\nall the open spots of that high ground, and looked down on the domed\r\nand towered city, sleeping darkly under its sleeping guardians, the\r\nmountains; on the pale gleam of the river; on the valley vanishing\r\ntowards the peaks of snow; and felt himself master of them all.\r\n\r\nThat sense of mental empire which belongs to us all in moments of\r\nexceptional clearness was intensified for him by the long days and\r\nnights in which memory had been little more than the consciousness of\r\nsomething gone. That city, which had been a weary labyrinth, was\r\nmaterial that he could subdue to his purposes now: his mind glanced\r\nthrough its affairs with flashing conjecture; he was once more a man\r\nwho knew cities, whose sense of vision was instructed with large\r\nexperience, and who felt the keen delight of holding all things in the\r\ngrasp of language. Names! Images!\xe2\x80\x94his mind rushed through its wealth\r\nwithout pausing, like one who enters on a great inheritance.\r\n\r\nBut amidst all that rushing eagerness there was one End presiding in\r\nBaldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness,\xe2\x80\x94a dark deity in the inmost cell, who only\r\nseemed forgotten while his hecatomb was being prepared. And when the\r\nfirst triumph in the certainty of recovered power had had its way, his\r\nthoughts centred themselves on Tito. That fair slippery viper could not\r\nescape him now; thanks to struggling justice, the heart that never\r\nquivered with tenderness for another had its sensitive selfish fibres\r\nthat could be reached by the sharp point of anguish. The soul that\r\nbowed to no right, bowed to the great lord of mortals, Pain.\r\n\r\nHe could search into every secret of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s life now: he knew some of\r\nthe secrets already, and the failure of the broken dagger, which seemed\r\nlike frustration, had been the beginning of achievement. Doubtless that\r\nsudden rage had shaken away the obstruction which stifled his soul.\r\nTwice before, when his memory had partially returned, it had been in\r\nconsequence of sudden excitation: once when he had had to defend\r\nhimself from an enraged dog: once when he had been overtaken by the\r\nwaves, and had had to scramble up a rock to save himself.\r\n\r\nYes, but if this time, as then, the light were to die out, and the\r\ndreary conscious blank come back again! This time the light was\r\nstronger and steadier; but what security was there that before the\r\nmorrow the dark fog would not be round him again? Even the fear seemed\r\nlike the beginning of feebleness: he thought with alarm that he might\r\nsink the faster for this excited vigil of his on the hill, which was\r\nexpending his force; and after seeking anxiously for a sheltered corner\r\nwhere he might lie down, he nestled at last against a heap of warm\r\ngarden straw, and so fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes again it was daylight. The first moments were\r\nfilled with strange bewilderment: he was a man with a double identity;\r\nto which had he awaked? to the life of dim-sighted sensibilities like\r\nthe sad heirship of some fallen greatness, or to the life of recovered\r\npower? Surely the last, for the events of the night all came back to\r\nhim: the recognition of the page in Pausanias, the crowding resurgence\r\nof facts and names, the sudden wide prospect which had given him such a\r\nmoment as that of the Maenad in the glorious amaze of her morning\r\nwaking on the mountain top.\r\n\r\nHe took up the book again, he read, he remembered without reading. He\r\nsaw a name, and the images of deeds rose with it: he saw the mention of\r\na deed, and he linked it with a name. There were stories of inexpiable\r\ncrimes, but stories also of guilt that seemed successful. There were\r\nsanctuaries for swift-footed miscreants: baseness had its armour, and\r\nthe weapons of justice sometimes broke against it. What then? If\r\nbaseness triumphed everywhere else, if it could heap to itself all the\r\ngoods of the world and even hold the keys of hell, it would never\r\ntriumph over the hatred which it had itself awakened. It could devise\r\nno torture that would seem greater than the torture of submitting to\r\nits smile. Baldassarre felt the indestructible independent force of a\r\nsupreme emotion, which knows no terror, and asks for no motive, which\r\nis itself an ever-burning motive, consuming all other desire. And now\r\nin this morning light, when the assurance came again that the fine\r\nfibres of association were active still, and that his recovered self\r\nhad not departed, all his gladness was but the hope of vengeance.\r\n\r\nFrom that time till the evening on which we have seen him enter the\r\nRucellai gardens, he had been incessantly, but cautiously, inquiring\r\ninto Tito\xe2\x80\x99s position and all his circumstances, and there was hardly a\r\nday on which he did not contrive to follow his movements. But he wished\r\nnot to arouse any alarm in Tito: he wished to secure a moment when the\r\nhated favourite of blind fortune was at the summit of confident ease,\r\nsurrounded by chief men on whose favour he depended. It was not any\r\nretributive payment or recognition of himself for his own behoof, on\r\nwhich Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s whole soul was bent: it was to find the sharpest\r\nedge of disgrace and shame by which a selfish smiler could be pierced;\r\nit was to send through his marrow the most sudden shock of dread. He\r\nwas content to lie hard, and live stintedly\xe2\x80\x94he had spent the greater\r\npart of his remaining money in buying another poniard: his hunger and\r\nhis thirst were after nothing exquisite but an exquisite vengeance. He\r\nhad avoided addressing himself to any one whom he suspected of intimacy\r\nwith Tito, lest an alarm raised in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s mind should urge him either\r\nto flight or to some other counteracting measure which hard-pressed\r\ningenuity might devise. For this reason he had never entered Nello\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop, which he observed that Tito frequented, and he had turned aside\r\nto avoid meeting Piero di Cosimo.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of frustration gave added eagerness to his desire that\r\nthe great opportunity he sought should not be deferred. The desire was\r\neager in him on another ground; he trembled lest his memory should go\r\nagain. Whether from the agitating presence of that fear, or from some\r\nother causes, he had twice felt a sort of mental dizziness, in which\r\nthe inward sense or imagination seemed to be losing the distinct forms\r\nof things. Once he had attempted to enter the Palazzo Vecchio and make\r\nhis way into a council-chamber where Tito was, and had failed. But now,\r\non this evening, he felt that his occasion was come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nA Supper in the Rucellai Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn entering the handsome pavilion, Tito\xe2\x80\x99s quick glance soon discerned\r\nin the selection of the guests the confirmation of his conjecture that\r\nthe object of the gathering was political, though, perhaps, nothing\r\nmore distinct than that strengthening of party which comes from\r\ngood-fellowship. Good dishes and good wine were at that time believed\r\nto heighten the consciousness of political preferences, and in the\r\ninspired ease of after-supper talk it was supposed that people\r\nascertained their own opinions with a clearness quite inaccessible to\r\nuninvited stomachs. The Florentines were a sober and frugal people; but\r\nwherever men have gathered wealth, Madonna della Gozzoviglia and San\r\nBuonvino have had their worshippers; and the Rucellai were among the\r\nfew Florentine families who kept a great table and lived splendidly. It\r\nwas not probable that on this evening there would be any attempt to\r\napply high philosophic theories; and there could be no objection to the\r\nbust of Plato looking on, or even to the modest presence of the\r\ncardinal virtues in fresco on the walls.\r\n\r\nThat bust of Plato had been long used to look down on conviviality of a\r\nmore transcendental sort, for it had been brought from Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s villa\r\nafter his death, when the meetings of the Platonic Academy had been\r\ntransferred to these gardens. Especially on every thirteenth of\r\nNovember, reputed anniversary of Plato\xe2\x80\x99s death, it had looked down from\r\nunder laurel leaves on a picked company of scholars and philosophers,\r\nwho met to eat and drink with moderation, and to discuss and admire,\r\nperhaps with less moderation, the doctrines of the great master:\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nPico della Mirandola, once a Quixotic young genius with long curls,\r\nastonished at his own powers and astonishing Rome with heterodox\r\ntheses; afterwards a more humble student with a consuming passion for\r\ninward perfection, having come to find the universe more astonishing\r\nthan his own cleverness:\xe2\x80\x94on innocent, laborious Marsilio Ficino, picked\r\nout young to be reared as a Platonic philosopher, and fed on Platonism\r\nin all its stages till his mind was perhaps a little pulpy from that\r\ntoo exclusive diet:\xe2\x80\x94on Angelo Poliziano, chief literary genius of that\r\nage, a born poet, and a scholar without dulness, whose phrases had\r\nblood in them and are alive still:\xe2\x80\x94or, further back, on Leon Battista\r\nAlberti, a reverend senior when those three were young, and of a much\r\ngrander type than they, a robust, universal mind, at once practical and\r\ntheoretic, artist, man of science, inventor, poet:\xe2\x80\x94and on many more\r\nvaliant workers whose names are not registered where every day we turn\r\nthe leaf to read them, but whose labours make a part, though an\r\nunrecognised part, of our inheritance, like the ploughing and sowing of\r\npast generations.\r\n\r\nBernardo Rucellai was a man to hold a distinguished place in that\r\nAcademy even before he became its host and patron. He was still in the\r\nprime of life, not more than four and forty, with a somewhat haughty,\r\ncautiously dignified presence; conscious of an amazingly pure Latinity,\r\nbut, says Erasmus, not to be caught speaking Latin\xe2\x80\x94no word of Latin to\r\nbe sheared off him by the sharpest of Teutons. He welcomed Tito with\r\nmore marked favour than usual and gave him a place between Lorenzo\r\nTornabuoni and Giannozzo Pucci, both of them accomplished young members\r\nof the Medicean party.\r\n\r\nOf course the talk was the lightest in the world while the brass bowl\r\nfilled with scented water was passing round, that the company might\r\nwash their hands, and rings flashed on white fingers under the\r\nwax-lights, and there was the pleasant fragrance of fresh white damask\r\nnewly come from France. The tone of remark was a very common one in\r\nthose times. Some one asked what Dante\xe2\x80\x99s pattern old Florentine would\r\nthink if the life could come into him again under his leathern belt and\r\nbone clasp, and he could see silver forks on the table? And it was\r\nagreed on all hands that the habits of posterity would be very\r\nsurprising to ancestors, if ancestors could only know them.\r\n\r\nAnd while the silver forks were just dallying with the appetising\r\ndelicacies that introduced the more serious business of the supper\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nas morsels of liver, cooked to that exquisite point that they would\r\nmelt in the mouth\xe2\x80\x94there was time to admire the designs on the enamelled\r\nsilver centres of the brass service, and to say something, as usual,\r\nabout the silver dish for confetti, a masterpiece of Antonio\r\nPollajuolo, whom patronising Popes had seduced from his native Florence\r\nto more gorgeous Rome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi, a middle-aged man, with that\r\nnegligent ease of manner which, seeming to claim nothing, is really\r\nbased on the lifelong consciousness of commanding rank\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI remember our\r\nAntonio getting bitter about his chiselling and enamelling of these\r\nmetal things, and taking in a fury to painting, because, said he, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nartist who puts his work into gold and silver, puts his brains into the\r\nmelting-pot.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is not unlikely to be a true foreboding of Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGiannozzo Pucci. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this pretty war with Pisa goes on, and the revolt\r\nonly spreads a little to our other towns, it is not only our silver\r\ndishes that are likely to go; I doubt whether Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s silver saints\r\nround the altar of San Giovanni will not some day vanish from the eyes\r\nof the faithful to be worshipped more devoutly in the form of coin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Frate is preparing us for that already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tornabuoni. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\ntelling the people that God will not have silver crucifixes and\r\nstarving stomachs; and that the church is best adorned with the gems of\r\nholiness and the fine gold of brotherly love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very useful doctrine of war-finance, as many a Condottiere has\r\nfound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo Rucellai, drily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut politics come on after the\r\nconfetti, Lorenzo, when we can drink wine enough to wash them down;\r\nthey are too solid to be taken with roast and boiled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi. \xe2\x80\x9cOur Luigi Pulci would have said\r\nthis delicate boiled kid must be eaten with an impartial mind. I\r\nremember one day at Careggi, when Luigi was in his rattling vein, he\r\nwas maintaining that nothing perverted the palate like opinion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98corrupts the saliva\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why men took to pepper.\r\nScepticism is the only philosophy that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring a taste in the\r\nmouth.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 says poor Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, \xe2\x80\x98you must be out there,\r\nLuigi. Here is this untainted sceptic, Matteo Franco, who wants hotter\r\nsauce than any of us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Because he has a strong opinion of himself,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nflashes out Luigi, which is the original egg of all other opinion. _He_\r\na sceptic? He believes in the immortality of his own verses. He is such\r\na logician as that preaching friar who described the pavement of the\r\nbottomless pit. Poor Luigi! his mind was like sharpest steel that can\r\ntouch nothing without cutting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet a very gentle-hearted creature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giannozzo Pucci. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseemed to me his talk was a mere blowing of soap-bubbles. What\r\ndithyrambs he went into about eating and drinking! and yet he was as\r\ntemperate as a butterfly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light talk and the solid eatables were not soon at an end, for\r\nafter the roast and boiled meats came the indispensable capon and game,\r\nand, crowning glory of a well-spread table, a peacock cooked according\r\nto the receipt of Apicius for cooking partridges, namely, with the\r\nfeathers on, but not plucked afterwards, as that great authority\r\nordered concerning his partridges; on the contrary, so disposed on the\r\ndish that it might look as much as possible like a live peacock taking\r\nits unboiled repose. Great was the skill required in that confidential\r\nservant who was the official carver, respectfully to turn the classical\r\nthough insipid bird on its back, and expose the plucked breast from\r\nwhich he was to dispense a delicate slice to each of the honourable\r\ncompany, unless any one should be of so independent a mind as to\r\ndecline that expensive toughness and prefer the vulgar digestibility of\r\ncapon.\r\n\r\nHardly any one was so bold. Tito quoted Horace and dispersed his slice\r\nin small particles over his plate; Bernardo Rucellai made a learned\r\nobservation about the ancient price of peacocks\xe2\x80\x99 eggs, but did not\r\npretend to eat his slice; and Niccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi held a mouthful on his\r\nfork while he told a favourite story of Luigi Pulci\xe2\x80\x99s, about a man of\r\nSiena, who, wanting to give a splendid entertainment at moderate\r\nexpense, bought a wild goose, cut off its beak and webbed feet, and\r\nboiled it in its feathers, to pass for a pea-hen.\r\n\r\nIn fact, very little peacock was eaten; but there was the satisfaction\r\nof sitting at a table where peacock was served up in a remarkable\r\nmanner, and of knowing that such caprices were not within reach of any\r\nbut those who supped with the very wealthiest men. And it would have\r\nbeen rashness to speak slightingly of peacock\xe2\x80\x99s flesh, or any other\r\nvenerable institution, at a time when Fra Girolamo was teaching the\r\ndisturbing doctrine that it was not the duty of the rich to be\r\nluxurious for the sake of the poor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the chill obscurity that surrounded this centre of\r\nwarmth, and light, and savoury odours, the lonely disowned man was\r\nwalking in gradually narrowing circuits. He paused among the trees, and\r\nlooked in at the windows, which made brilliant pictures against the\r\ngloom. He could hear the laughter; he could see Tito gesticulating with\r\ncareless grace, and hear his voice, now alone, now mingling in the\r\nmerry confusion of interlacing speeches. Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s mind was highly\r\nstrung. He was preparing himself for the moment when he could win his\r\nentrance into this brilliant company; and he had a savage satisfaction\r\nin the sight of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s easy gaiety, which seemed to be preparing the\r\nunconscious victim for more effective torture.\r\n\r\nBut the men seated among the branching tapers and the flashing cups\r\ncould know nothing of the pale fierce face that watched them from\r\nwithout. The light can be a curtain as well as the darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd the talk went on with more eagerness as it became less disconnected\r\nand trivial. The sense of citizenship was just then strongly forced\r\neven on the most indifferent minds. What the overmastering Fra Girolamo\r\nwas saying and prompting was really uppermost in the thoughts of every\r\none at table; and before the stewed fish was removed, and while the\r\nfavourite sweets were yet to come, his name rose to the surface of the\r\nconversation, and, in spite of Rucellai\xe2\x80\x99s previous prohibition, the\r\ntalk again became political. At first, while the servants remained\r\npresent, it was mere gossip: what had been done in the Palazzo on the\r\nfirst day\xe2\x80\x99s voting for the Great Council; how hot-tempered and\r\ndomineering Francesco Valori was, as if he were to have everything his\r\nown way by right of his austere virtue, and how it was clear to\r\neverybody who heard Soderini\xe2\x80\x99s speeches in favour of the Great Council\r\nand also heard the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s sermons, that they were both kneaded in the\r\nsame trough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Frate has a longer\r\nhead for public matters than Soderini or any Piagnone among them: you\r\nmay depend on it that Soderini is his mouthpiece more than he is\r\nSoderini\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Niccol\xc3\xb2; there I differ from you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo Ruccellai: \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nFrate has an acute mind, and readily sees what will serve his own ends;\r\nbut it is not likely that Pagolantonio Soderini, who has had long\r\nexperience of affairs, and has specially studied the Venetian Council,\r\nshould be much indebted to a monk for ideas on that subject. No, no;\r\nSoderini loads the cannon; though, I grant you, Fra Girolamo brings the\r\npowder and lights the match. He is master of the people, and the people\r\nare getting master of us. Ecco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorenzo Tornabuoni, presently, when the room was clear of\r\nservants, and nothing but wine was passing round, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether Soderini is\r\nindebted or not, _we_ are indebted to the Frate for the general amnesty\r\nwhich has gone along with the scheme of the Council. We might have done\r\nwithout the fear of God and the reform of morals being passed by a\r\nmajority of black beans; but that excellent proposition, that our\r\nMedicean heads should be allowed to remain comfortably on our\r\nshoulders, and that we should not be obliged to hand over our property\r\nin fines, has my warm approval, and it is my belief that nothing but\r\nthe Frate\xe2\x80\x99s predominance could have procured that for us. And you may\r\nrely on it that Fra Girolamo is as firm as a rock on that point of\r\npromoting peace. I have had an interview with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of surprise and curiosity at the farther end of the\r\ntable; but Bernardo Rucellai simply nodded, as if he knew what\r\nTornabuoni had to say, and wished him to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Tornabuoni, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been favoured with an interview in\r\nthe Frate\xe2\x80\x99s own cell, which, let me tell you, is not a common favour;\r\nfor I have reason to believe that even Francesco Valori very seldom\r\nsees him in private. However, I think he saw me the more willingly\r\nbecause I was not a ready-made follower, but had to be converted. And,\r\nfor my part, I see clearly enough that the only safe and wise policy\r\nfor us Mediceans to pursue is to throw our strength into the scale of\r\nthe Frate\xe2\x80\x99s party. We are not strong enough to make head on our own\r\nbehalf; and if the Frate and the popular party were upset, every one\r\nwho hears me knows perfectly well what other party would be uppermost\r\njust now: Nerli, Alberti, Pazzi, and the rest\xe2\x80\x94_Arrabbiati_, as somebody\r\nchristened them the other day\xe2\x80\x94who, instead of giving us an amnesty,\r\nwould be inclined to fly at our throats like mad dogs, and not be\r\nsatisfied till they had banished half of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were strong interjections of assent to this last sentence of\r\nTornabuoni\xe2\x80\x99s, as he paused and looked round a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wise dissimulation,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis the only course for moderate\r\nrational men in times of violent party feeling. I need hardly tell this\r\ncompany what are my real political attachments: I am not the only man\r\nhere who has strong personal ties to the banished family; but, apart\r\nfrom any such ties, I agree with my more experienced friends, who are\r\nallowing me to speak for them in their presence, that the only lasting\r\nand peaceful state of things for Florence is the predominance of some\r\nsingle family interest. This theory of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s, that we are to have\r\na popular government, in which every man is to strive only for the\r\ngeneral good, and know no party names, is a theory that may do for some\r\nisle of Cristoforo Colombo\xe2\x80\x99s finding, but will never do for our fine\r\nold quarrelsome Florence. A change must come before long, and with\r\npatience and caution we have every chance of determining the change in\r\nour favour. Meanwhile, the best thing we can do will be to keep the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s flag flying, for if any other were to be hoisted just now it\r\nwould be a black flag for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi, in a curt decisive way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you\r\nsay is true, Lorenzo. For my own part, I am too old for anybody to\r\nbelieve that I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my feathers. And there are certain of us\xe2\x80\x94our\r\nold Bernardo del Nero for one\xe2\x80\x94whom you would never persuade to borrow\r\nanother man\xe2\x80\x99s shield. But we can lie still, like sleepy old dogs; and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s clear enough that barking would be of no use just now. As for this\r\npsalm-singing party, who vote for nothing but the glory of God, and\r\nwant to make believe we can all love each other, and talk as if vice\r\ncould be swept out with a besom by the Magnificent Eight, their day\r\nwill not be a long one. After all the talk of scholars, there are but\r\ntwo sorts of government: one where men show their teeth at each other,\r\nand one where men show their tongues and lick the feet of the\r\nstrongest. They\xe2\x80\x99ll get their Great Council finally voted\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s certain enough\xe2\x80\x94and they\xe2\x80\x99ll think they\xe2\x80\x99ve found out a\r\nnew plan of government; but as sure as there\xe2\x80\x99s a human skin under every\r\nlucco in the Council, their new plan will end like every other, in\r\nsnarling or in licking. That\xe2\x80\x99s my view of things as a plain man. Not\r\nthat I consider it becoming in men of family and following, who have\r\ngot others depending on their constancy and on their sticking to their\r\ncolours, to go a-hunting with a fine net to catch reasons in the air,\r\nlike doctors of law. I say frankly that, as the head of my family, I\r\nshall be true to my old alliances; and I have never yet seen any\r\nchalk-mark on political reasons to tell me which is true and which is\r\nfalse. My friend Bernardo Rucellai here is a man of reasons, I know,\r\nand I have no objection to anybody\xe2\x80\x99s finding fine-spun reasons for me,\r\nso that they don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with my actions as a man of family who has\r\nfaith to keep with his connections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is an appeal to me, Niccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo Rucellai, with a\r\nformal dignity, in amusing contrast with Ridolfi\xe2\x80\x99s curt and pithy ease,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may take this opportunity of saying, that while my wishes are partly\r\ndetermined by long-standing personal relations, I cannot enter into any\r\npositive schemes with persons over whose actions I have no control. I\r\nmyself might be content with a restoration of the old order of things;\r\nbut with modifications\xe2\x80\x94with important modifications. And the one point\r\non which I wish to declare my concurrence with Lorenzo Tornabuoni is,\r\nthat the best policy to be pursued by our friends is, to throw the\r\nweight of their interest into the scale of the popular party. For\r\nmyself, I condescend to no dissimulation; nor do I at present see the\r\nparty or the scheme that commands my full assent. In all alike there is\r\ncrudity and confusion of ideas, and of all the twenty men who are my\r\ncolleagues in the present crisis, there is not one with whom I do not\r\nfind myself in wide disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNiccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi shrugged his shoulders, and left it to some one else to\r\ntake up the ball. As the wine went round the talk became more and more\r\nfrank and lively, and the desire of several at once to be the chief\r\nspeaker, as usual caused the company to break up into small knots of\r\ntwo and three.\r\n\r\nIt was a result which had been foreseen by Lorenzo Tornabuoni and\r\nGiannozzo Pucci, and they were among the first to turn aside from the\r\nhighroad of general talk and enter into a special conversation with\r\nTito, who sat between them; gradually pushing away their seats, and\r\nturning their backs on the table and wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, Melema,\xe2\x80\x9d Tornabuoni was saying at this stage, laying one\r\nhose-clad leg across the knee of the other, and caressing his ankle, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow of no man in Florence who can serve our party better than you. You\r\nsee what most of our friends are: men who can no more hide their\r\nprejudices than a dog can hide the natural tone of his bark, or else\r\nmen whose political ties are so notorious, that they must always be\r\nobjects of suspicion. Giannozzo here, and I, I flatter myself, are able\r\nto overcome that suspicion; we have that power of concealment and\r\nfinesse, without which a rational cultivated man, instead of having any\r\nprerogative, is really at a disadvantage compared with a wild bull or a\r\nsavage. But, except yourself, I know of no one else on whom we could\r\nrely for the necessary discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giannozzo Pucci, laying his hand on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nfact is, Tito mio, you can help us better than if you were Ulysses\r\nhimself, for I am convinced that Ulysses often made himself\r\ndisagreeable. To manage men one ought to have a sharp mind in a velvet\r\nsheath. And there is not a soul in Florence who could undertake a\r\nbusiness like this journey to Rome, for example, with the same safety\r\nthat you can. There is your scholarship, which may always be a pretext\r\nfor such journeys; and what is better, there is your talent, which it\r\nwould be harder to match than your scholarship. Niccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli\r\nmight have done for us if he had been on our side, but hardly so well.\r\nHe is too much bitten with notions, and has not your power of\r\nfascination. All the worse for him. He has lost a great chance in life,\r\nand you have got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tornabuoni, lowering his voice in a significant manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou have only to play your game well, Melema, and the future belongs\r\nto you. For the Medici, you may rely upon it, will keep a foot in Rome\r\nas well as in Florence, and the time may not be far-off when they will\r\nbe able to make a finer career for their adherents even than they did\r\nin old days. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you take orders some day? There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncardinal\xe2\x80\x99s hat at the end of that road, and you would not be the first\r\nGreek who has worn that ornament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito laughed gaily. He was too acute not to measure Tornabuoni\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexaggerated flattery, but still the flattery had a pleasant flavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy joints are not so stiff yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t be induced to\r\nrun without such a high prize as that. I think the income of an abbey\r\nor two held \xe2\x80\x98in commendam,\xe2\x80\x99 without the trouble of getting my head\r\nshaved, would satisfy me at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not joking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tornabuoni, with grave suavity; \xe2\x80\x9cI think a\r\nscholar would always be the better off for taking orders. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntalk of that another time. One of the objects to be first borne in\r\nmind, is that you should win the confidence of the men who hang about\r\nSan Marco; that is what Giannozzo and I shall do, but you may carry it\r\nfarther than we can, because you are less observed. In that way you can\r\nget a thorough knowledge of their doings, and you will make a broader\r\nscreen for your agency on our side. Nothing of course can be done\r\nbefore you start for Rome, because this bit of business between Piero\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Medici and the French nobles must be effected at once. I mean when\r\nyou come back, of course; I need say no more. I believe you could make\r\nyourself the pet votary of San Marco, if you liked; but you are wise\r\nenough to know that effective dissimulation is never immoderate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were not that an adhesion to the popular side is necessary to\r\nyour safety as an agent of our party, Tito mio,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giannozzo Pucci,\r\nwho was more fraternal and less patronising in his manner than\r\nTornabuoni, \xe2\x80\x9cI could have wished your skill to have been employed in\r\nanother way, for which it is still better fitted. But now we must look\r\nout for some other man among us who will manage to get into the\r\nconfidence of our sworn enemies, the Arrabbiati; we need to know their\r\nmovements more than those of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s party, who are strong enough\r\nto play above-board. Still, it would have been a difficult thing for\r\nyou, from your known relations with the Medici a little while back, and\r\nthat sort of kinship your wife has with Bernardo del Nero. We must find\r\na man who has no distinguished connections, and who has not yet taken\r\nany side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito was pushing his hair backward automatically, as his manner was,\r\nand looking straight at Pucci with a scarcely perceptible smile on his\r\nlip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need to look out for any one else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nmanage the whole business with perfect ease. I will engage to make\r\nmyself the special confidant of that thick-headed Dolfo Spini, and know\r\nhis projects before he knows them himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito seldom spoke so confidently of his own powers, but he was in a\r\nstate of exaltation at the sudden opening of a new path before him,\r\nwhere fortune seemed to have hung higher prizes than any he had thought\r\nof hitherto. Hitherto he had seen success only in the form of favour;\r\nit now flashed on him in the shape of power\xe2\x80\x94of such power as is\r\npossible to talent without traditional ties, and without beliefs. Each\r\nparty that thought of him as a tool might become dependent on him. His\r\nposition as an alien, his indifference to the ideas or prejudices of\r\nthe men amongst whom he moved, were suddenly transformed into\r\nadvantages; he became newly conscious of his own adroitness in the\r\npresence of a game that he was called on to play. And all the motives\r\nwhich might have made Tito shrink from the triple deceit that came\r\nbefore him as a tempting game, had been slowly strangled in him by the\r\nsuccessive falsities of his life.\r\n\r\nOur lives make a moral tradition for our individual selves, as the life\r\nof mankind at large makes a moral tradition for the race; and to have\r\nonce acted nobly seems a reason why we should always be noble. But Tito\r\nwas feeling the effect of an opposite tradition: he had won no memories\r\nof self-conquest and perfect faithfulness from which he could have a\r\nsense of falling.\r\n\r\nThe triple colloquy went on with growing spirit till it was interrupted\r\nby a call from the table. Probably the movement came from the listeners\r\nin the party, who were afraid lest the talkers should tire themselves.\r\nAt all events it was agreed that there had been enough of gravity, and\r\nRucellai had just ordered new flasks of Montepulciano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many minstrels are there among us?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when there had been a\r\ngeneral rallying round the table. \xe2\x80\x9cMelema, I think you are the chief:\r\nMatteo will give you the lute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Giannozzo Pucci, \xe2\x80\x9clead the last chorus from Poliziano\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Orfeo,\xe2\x80\x99 that you have found such an excellent measure for, and we will\r\nall fall in:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ciascum segua, o Bacco, te:\r\nBacco, Bacco, evoe, evoe!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe servant put the lute into Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and then said something in\r\nan undertone to his master. A little subdued questioning and answering\r\nwent on between them, while Tito touched the lute in a preluding way to\r\nthe strain of the chorus, and there was a confusion of speech and\r\nmusical humming all round the table. Bernardo Rucellai had said, \xe2\x80\x9cWait\r\na moment, Melema;\xe2\x80\x9d but the words had been unheard by Tito, who was\r\nleaning towards Pucci, and singing low to him the phrases of the\r\nMaenad-chorus. He noticed nothing until the buzz round the table\r\nsuddenly ceased, and the notes of his own voice, with its soft\r\nlow-toned triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cEvoe, evoe!\xe2\x80\x9d fell in startling isolation.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange moment. Baldassarre had moved round the table till he\r\nwas opposite Tito, and as the hum ceased there might be seen for an\r\ninstant Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s fierce dark eyes bent on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s bright smiling\r\nunconsciousness, while the low notes of triumph dropped from his lips\r\ninto the silence.\r\n\r\nTito looked up with a slight start, and his lips turned pale, but he\r\nseemed hardly more moved than Giannozzo Pucci, who had looked up at the\r\nsame moment\xe2\x80\x94or even than several others round the table; for that\r\nsallow deep-lined face with the hatred in its eyes seemed a terrible\r\napparition across the wax-lit ease and gaiety. And Tito quickly\r\nrecovered some self-command. \xe2\x80\x9cA mad old man\xe2\x80\x94he looks like it\xe2\x80\x94he _is_\r\nmad!\xe2\x80\x9d was the instantaneous thought that brought some courage with it;\r\nfor he could conjecture no inward change in Baldassarre since they had\r\nmet before. He just let his eyes fall and laid the lute on the table\r\nwith apparent ease; but his fingers pinched the neck of the lute hard\r\nwhile he governed his head and his glance sufficiently to look with an\r\nair of quiet appeal towards Bernardo Rucellai, who said at once\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood man, what is your business? What is the important declaration\r\nthat you have to make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMesser Bernardo Rucellai, I wish you and your honourable friends to\r\nknow in what sort of company you are sitting. There is a traitor among\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general movement of alarm. Every one present, except Tito,\r\nthought of political danger and not of private injury.\r\n\r\nBaldassarre began to speak as if he were thoroughly assured of what he\r\nhad to say; but, in spite of his long preparation for this moment,\r\nthere was the tremor of overmastering excitement in his voice. His\r\npassion shook him. He went on, but he did not say what he had meant to\r\nsay. As he fixed his eyes on Tito again the passionate words were like\r\nblows\xe2\x80\x94they defied premeditation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a man among you who is a scoundrel, a liar, a robber. I was a\r\nfather to him. I took him from beggary when he was a child. I reared\r\nhim, I cherished him, I taught him, I made him a scholar. My head has\r\nlain hard that his might have a pillow. And he left me in slavery; he\r\nsold the gems that were mine, and when I came again, he denied me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last words had been uttered with almost convulsed agitation, and\r\nBaldassarre paused, trembling. All glances were turned on Tito, who was\r\nnow looking straight at Baldassarre. It was a moment of desperation\r\nthat annihilated all feeling in him, except the determination to risk\r\nanything for the chance of escape. And he gathered confidence from the\r\nagitation by which Baldassarre was evidently shaken. He had ceased to\r\npinch the neck of the lute, and had thrust his thumbs into his belt,\r\nwhile his lips had begun to assume a slight curl. He had never yet done\r\nan act of murderous cruelty even to the smallest animal that could\r\nutter a cry, but at that moment he would have been capable of treading\r\nthe breath from a smiling child for the sake of his own safety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean, Melema?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo Rucellai, in a tone of\r\ncautious surprise. He, as well as the rest of the company, felt\r\nrelieved that the tenor of the accusation was not political.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMesser Bernardo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe this man is mad. I did not\r\nrecognise him the first time he encountered me in Florence, but I know\r\nnow that he is the servant who years ago accompanied me and my adoptive\r\nfather to Greece, and was dismissed on account of misdemeanours. His\r\nname is Jacopo di Nola. Even at that time I believe his mind was\r\nunhinged, for, without any reason, he had conceived a strange hatred\r\ntowards me; and now I am convinced that he is labouring under a mania\r\nwhich causes him to mistake his identity. He has already attempted my\r\nlife since he has been in Florence; and I am in constant danger from\r\nhim. But he is an object of pity rather than of indignation. It is too\r\ncertain that my father is dead. You have only my word for it; but I\r\nmust leave it to your judgment how far it is probable that a man of\r\nintellect and learning would have been lurking about in dark corners\r\nfor the last month with the purpose of assassinating me; or how far it\r\nis probable that, if this man were my second father, I could have any\r\nmotive for denying him. That story about my being rescued from beggary\r\nis the vision of a diseased brain. But it will be a satisfaction to me\r\nat least if you will demand from him proofs of his identity, lest any\r\nmalignant person should choose to make this mad impeachment a reproach\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito had felt more and more confidence as he went on; the lie was not\r\nso difficult when it was once begun; and as the words fell easily from\r\nhis lips, they gave him a sense of power such as men feel when they\r\nhave begun a muscular feat successfully. In this way he acquired\r\nboldness enough to end with a challenge for proofs.\r\n\r\nBaldassarre, while he had been walking in the gardens and afterwards\r\nwaiting in an outer room of the pavilion with the servants, had been\r\nmaking anew the digest of the evidence he would bring to prove his\r\nidentity and Tito\xe2\x80\x99s baseness, recalling the description and history of\r\nhis gems, and assuring himself by rapid mental glances that he could\r\nattest his learning and his travels. It might be partly owing to this\r\nnervous strain that the new shock of rage he felt as Tito\xe2\x80\x99s lie fell on\r\nhis ears brought a strange bodily effect with it: a cold stream seemed\r\nto rush over him, and the last words of the speech seemed to be drowned\r\nby ringing chimes. Thought gave way to a dizzy horror, as if the earth\r\nwere slipping away from under him. Every one in the room was looking at\r\nhim as Tito ended, and saw that the eyes which had had such fierce\r\nintensity only a few minutes before had now a vague fear in them. He\r\nclutched the back of a seat, and was silent.\r\n\r\nHardly any evidence could have been more in favour of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s assertion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely I have seen this man before, somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tornabuoni.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly you have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, readily, in a low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the\r\nescaped prisoner who clutched me on the steps of the Duomo. I did not\r\nrecognise him then; he looks now more as he used to do, except that he\r\nhas a more unmistakable air of mad imbecility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cast no doubt on your word, Melema,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo Rucellai, with\r\ncautious gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are right to desire some positive test of\r\nthe fact.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to Baldassarre, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are the person\r\nyou claim to be, you can doubtless give some description of the gems\r\nwhich were your property. I myself was the purchaser of more than one\r\ngem from Messer Tito\xe2\x80\x94the chief rings, I believe, in his collection. One\r\nof them is a fine sard, engraved with a subject from Homer. If, as you\r\nallege, you are a scholar, and the rightful owner of that ring, you can\r\ndoubtless turn to the noted passage in Homer from which that subject is\r\ntaken. Do you accept this test, Melema? or have you anything to allege\r\nagainst its validity? The Jacopo you speak of, was he a scholar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful crisis for Tito. If he said \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d his quick mind told\r\nhim that he would shake the credibility of his story: if he said \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe risked everything on the uncertain extent of Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimbecility. But there was no noticeable pause before he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\r\naccept the test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence while Rucellai moved towards the recess where\r\nthe books were, and came back with the fine Florentine Homer in his\r\nhand. Baldassarre, when he was addressed, had turned his head towards\r\nthe speaker, and Rucellai believed that he had understood him. But he\r\nchose to repeat what he had said, that there might be no mistake as to\r\nthe test.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ring I possess,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis a fine sard, engraved with a subject\r\nfrom Homer. There was no other at all resembling it in Messer Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncollection. Will you turn to the passage in Homer from which that\r\nsubject is taken? Seat yourself here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, laying the book on the\r\ntable, and pointing to his own seat while he stood beside it.\r\n\r\nBaldassarre had so far recovered from the first confused horror\r\nproduced by the sensation of rushing coldness and chiming din in the\r\nears as to be partly aware of what was said to him: he was aware that\r\nsomething was being demanded from him to prove his identity, but he\r\nformed no distinct idea of the details. The sight of the book recalled\r\nthe habitual longing and faint hope that he could read and understand,\r\nand he moved towards the chair immediately.\r\n\r\nThe book was open before him, and he bent his head a little towards it,\r\nwhile everybody watched him eagerly. He turned no leaf. His eyes\r\nwandered over the pages that lay before him, and then fixed on them a\r\nstraining gaze. This lasted for two or three minutes in dead silence.\r\nThen he lifted his hands to each side of his head, and said, in a low\r\ntone of despair, \xe2\x80\x9cLost, lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something so piteous in the wandering look and the low cry,\r\nthat while they confirmed the belief in his madness they raised\r\ncompassion. Nay, so distinct sometimes is the working of a double\r\nconsciousness within us, that Tito himself, while he triumphed in the\r\napparent verification of his lie, wished that he had never made the lie\r\nnecessary to himself\xe2\x80\x94wished he had recognised his father on the\r\nsteps\xe2\x80\x94wished he had gone to seek him\xe2\x80\x94wished everything had been\r\ndifferent. But he had borrowed from the terrible usurer Falsehood, and\r\nthe loan had mounted and mounted with the years, till he belonged to\r\nthe usurer, body and soul.\r\n\r\nThe compassion excited in all the witnesses was not without its danger\r\nto Tito; for conjecture is constantly guided by feeling, and more than\r\none person suddenly conceived that this man might have been a scholar\r\nand have lost his faculties. On the other hand, they had not present to\r\ntheir minds the motives which could have led Tito to the denial of his\r\nbenefactor, and having no ill-will towards him, it would have been\r\ndifficult to them to believe that he had been uttering the basest of\r\nlies. And the originally common type of Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s person, coarsened\r\nby years of hardship, told as a confirmation of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s lie. If\r\nBaldassarre, to begin with, could have uttered precisely the words he\r\nhad premeditated, there might have been something in the form of his\r\naccusation which would have given it the stamp not only of true\r\nexperience but of mental refinement. But there had been no such\r\ntestimony in his impulsive agitated words: and there seemed the very\r\nopposite testimony in the rugged face and the coarse hands that\r\ntrembled beside it, standing out in strong contrast in the midst of\r\nthat velvet-clad, fair-handed company.\r\n\r\nHis next movement, while he was being watched in silence, told against\r\nhim too. He took his hands from his head, and felt for something under\r\nhis tunic. Every one guessed what that movement meant\xe2\x80\x94guessed that\r\nthere was a weapon at his side. Glances were interchanged; and Bernardo\r\nRucellai said, in a quiet tone, touching Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, this is an important business of yours. You shall have all\r\njustice. Follow me into a private room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldassarre was still in that half-stunned state in which he was\r\nsusceptible to any prompting, in the same way as an insect that forms\r\nno conception of what the prompting leads to. He rose from his seat,\r\nand followed Rucellai out of the room.\r\n\r\nIn two or three minutes Rucellai came back again, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is safe under lock and key. Piero Pitti, you are one of the\r\nMagnificent Eight, what do you think of our sending Matteo to the\r\npalace for a couple of sbirri, who may escort him to the Stinche? (The\r\nlargest prison in Florence.) If there is any danger in him, as I think\r\nthere is, he will be safe there; and we can inquire about him\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPitti assented, and the order was given.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is certainly an ill-looking fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tornabuoni. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say\r\nhe has attempted your life already, Melema?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the talk turned on the various forms of madness, and the fierceness\r\nof the southern blood. If the seeds of conjecture unfavourable to Tito\r\nhad been planted in the mind of any one present, they were hardly\r\nstrong enough to grow without the aid of much daylight and ill-will.\r\nThe common-looking, wild-eyed old man, clad in serge, might have won\r\nbelief without very strong evidence, if he had accused a man who was\r\nenvied and disliked. As it was, the only congruous and probable view of\r\nthe case seemed to be the one that sent the unpleasant accuser safely\r\nout of sight, and left the pleasant serviceable Tito just where he was\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe subject gradually floated away, and gave place to others, till a\r\nheavy tramp, and something like the struggling of a man who was being\r\ndragged away, were heard outside. The sounds soon died out, and the\r\ninterruption seemed to make the last hour\xe2\x80\x99s conviviality more resolute\r\nand vigorous. Every one was willing to forget a disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s heart was palpitating, and the wine tasted no better to him than\r\nif it had been blood.\r\n\r\nTo-night he had paid a heavier price than ever to make himself safe. He\r\ndid not like the price, and yet it was inevitable that he should be\r\nglad of the purchase.\r\n\r\nAnd after all he led the chorus. He was in a state of excitement in\r\nwhich oppressive sensations, and the wretched consciousness of\r\nsomething hateful but irrevocable, were mingled with a feeling of\r\ntriumph which seemed to assert itself as the feeling that would subsist\r\nand be master of the morrow.\r\n\r\nAnd it _was_ master. For on the morrow, as we saw, when he was about to\r\nstart on his mission to Rome, he had the air of a man well satisfied\r\nwith the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nAn Arresting Voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Romola sat down on the stone under the cypress, all things\r\nconspired to give her the sense of freedom and solitude: her escape\r\nfrom the accustomed walls and streets; the widening distance from her\r\nhusband, who was by this time riding towards Siena, while every hour\r\nwould take her farther on the opposite way; the morning stillness; the\r\ngreat dip of ground on the roadside making a gulf between her and the\r\nsombre calm of the mountains. For the first time in her life she felt\r\nalone in the presence of the earth and sky, with no human presence\r\ninterposing and making a law for her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice close to her said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Romola de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, the wife of Tito Melema.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew the voice: it had vibrated through her more than once before;\r\nand because she knew it, she did not turn round or look up. She sat\r\nshaken by awe, and yet inwardly rebelling against the awe. It was one\r\nof those black-skirted monks who was daring to speak to her, and\r\ninterfere with her privacy: that was all. And yet she was shaken, as if\r\nthat destiny which men thought of as a sceptred deity had come to her,\r\nand grasped her with fingers of flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are fleeing from Florence in disguise. I have a command from God\r\nto stop you. You are not permitted to flee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s anger at the intrusion mounted higher at these imperative\r\nwords. She would not turn round to look at the speaker, whose examining\r\ngaze she resented. Sitting quite motionless, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have you to speak to me, or to hinder me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right of a messenger. You have put on a religious garb, and you\r\nhave no religious purpose. You have sought the garb as a disguise. But\r\nyou were not suffered to pass me without being discerned. It was\r\ndeclared to me who you were: it is declared to me that you are seeking\r\nto escape from the lot God has laid upon you. You wish your true name\r\nand your true place in life to be hidden, that you may choose for\r\nyourself a new name and a new place, and have no rule but your own\r\nwill. And I have a command to call you back. My daughter, you must\r\nreturn to your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s mind rose in stronger rebellion with every sentence. She was\r\nthe more determined not to show any sign of submission, because the\r\nconsciousness of being inwardly shaken made her dread lest she should\r\nfall into irresolution. She spoke with more irritation than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not return. I acknowledge no right of priests and monks to\r\ninterfere with my actions. You have no power over me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know you have been brought up in scorn of obedience. But it\r\nis not the poor monk who claims to interfere with you: it is the truth\r\nthat commands you. And you cannot escape it. Either you must obey it,\r\nand it will lead you; or you must disobey it, and it will hang on you\r\nwith the weight of a chain which you will drag for ever. But you will\r\nobey it, my daughter. Your old servant will return to you with the\r\nmules; my companion is gone to fetch him; and you will go back to\r\nFlorence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started up with anger in her eyes, and faced the speaker. It was\r\nFra Girolamo: she knew that well enough before. She was nearly as tall\r\nas he was, and their faces were almost on a level. She had started up\r\nwith defiant words ready to burst from her lips, but they fell back\r\nagain without utterance. She had met Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s calm glance, and\r\nthe impression from it was so new to her, that her anger sank ashamed\r\nas something irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing transcendent in Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s face. It was not\r\nbeautiful. It was strong-featured, and owed all its refinement to\r\nhabits of mind and rigid discipline of the body. The source of the\r\nimpression his glance produced on Romola was the sense it conveyed to\r\nher of interest in her and care for her apart from any personal\r\nfeeling. It was the first time she had encountered a gaze in which\r\nsimple human fellowship expressed itself as a strongly-felt bond. Such\r\na glance is half the vocation of the priest or spiritual guide of men,\r\nand Romola felt it impossible again to question his authority to speak\r\nto her. She stood silent, looking at him. And he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou assert your freedom proudly, my daughter. But who is so base as\r\nthe debtor that thinks himself free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sting in those words, and Romola\xe2\x80\x99s countenance changed as\r\nif a subtle pale flash had gone over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are flying from your debts: the debt of a Florentine woman;\r\nthe debt of a wife. You are turning your back on the lot that has been\r\nappointed for you\xe2\x80\x94you are going to choose another. But can man or woman\r\nchoose duties? No more than they can choose their birthplace or their\r\nfather and mother. My daughter, you are fleeing from the presence of\r\nGod into the wilderness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the anger melted from Romola\xe2\x80\x99s mind, it had given place to a new\r\npresentiment of the strength there might be in submission, if this man,\r\nat whom she was beginning to look with a vague reverence, had some\r\nvalid law to show her. But no\xe2\x80\x94it was impossible; he could not know what\r\ndetermined her. Yet she could not again simply refuse to be guided; she\r\nwas constrained to plead; and in her new need to be reverent while she\r\nresisted, the title which she had never given him before came to her\r\nlips without forethought, \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, you cannot know the reasons which\r\ncompel me to go. None can know them but myself. None can judge for me.\r\nI have been driven by great sorrow. I am resolved to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know enough, my daughter: my mind has been so far illuminated\r\nconcerning you, that I know enough. You are not happy in your married\r\nlife; but I am not a confessor, and I seek to know nothing that should\r\nbe reserved for the seal of confession. I have a divine warrant to stop\r\nyou, which does not depend on such knowledge. You were warned by a\r\nmessage from heaven, delivered in my presence\xe2\x80\x94you were warned before\r\nmarriage, when you might still have lawfully chosen to be free from the\r\nmarriage-bond. But you chose the bond; and in wilfully breaking it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nspeak to you as a pagan, if the holy mystery of matrimony is not sacred\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x94you are breaking a pledge. Of what wrongs will you complain, my\r\ndaughter, when you yourself are committing one of the greatest wrongs a\r\nwoman and a citizen can be guilty of\xe2\x80\x94withdrawing in secrecy and\r\ndisguise from a pledge which you have given in the face of God and your\r\nfellow-men? Of what wrongs will you complain, when you yourself are\r\nbreaking the simplest law that lies at the foundation of the trust\r\nwhich binds man to man\xe2\x80\x94faithfulness to the spoken word? This, then, is\r\nthe wisdom you have gained by scorning the mysteries of the Church?\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nto see the bare duty of integrity, where the Church would have taught\r\nyou to see, not integrity only, but religion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood had rushed to Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face, and she shrank as if she had\r\nbeen stricken. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not have put on a disguise,\xe2\x80\x9d she began; but she\r\ncould not go on,\xe2\x80\x94she was too much shaken by the suggestion in the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s words of a possible affinity between her own conduct and\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to break that pledge you fly from Florence: Florence, where there\r\nare the only men and women in the world to whom you owe the debt of a\r\nfellow-citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should never have quitted Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, tremulously, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nlong as there was any hope of my fulfilling a duty to my father there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you own no tie but that of a child to her father in the flesh?\r\nYour life has been spent in blindness, my daughter. You have lived with\r\nthose who sit on a hill aloof, and look down on the life of their\r\nfellow-men. I know their vain discourse. It is of what has been in the\r\ntimes which they fill with their own fancied wisdom, while they scorn\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s work in the present. And doubtless you were taught how there were\r\npagan women who felt what it was to live for the Republic; yet you have\r\nnever felt that you, a Florentine woman, should live for Florence. If\r\nyour own people are wearing a yoke, will you slip from under it,\r\ninstead of struggling with them to lighten it? There is hunger and\r\nmisery in our streets, yet you say, \xe2\x80\x98I care not; I have my own sorrows;\r\nI will go away, if peradventure I can ease them.\xe2\x80\x99 The servants of God\r\nare struggling after a law of justice, peace, and charity, that the\r\nhundred thousand citizens among whom you were born may be governed\r\nrighteously; but you think no more of this than if you were a bird,\r\nthat may spread its wings and fly whither it will in search of food to\r\nits liking. And yet you have scorned the teaching of the Church, my\r\ndaughter. As if you, a wilful wanderer, following your own blind\r\nchoice, were not below the humblest Florentine woman who stretches\r\nforth her hands with her own people, and craves a blessing for them;\r\nand feels a close sisterhood with the neighbour who kneels beside her\r\nand is not of her own blood; and thinks of the mighty purpose that God\r\nhas for Florence; and waits and endures because the promised work is\r\ngreat, and she feels herself little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not going away to ease and self-indulgence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nraising her head again, with a prompting to vindicate herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\ngoing away to hardship. I expect no joy: it is gone from my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are seeking your own will, my daughter. You are seeking some good\r\nother than the law you are bound to obey. But how will you find good?\r\nIt is not a thing of choice: it is a river that flows from the foot of\r\nthe Invisible Throne, and flows by the path of obedience. I say again,\r\nman cannot choose his duties. You may choose to forsake your duties,\r\nand choose not to have the sorrow they bring. But you will go forth;\r\nand what will you find, my daughter? Sorrow without duty\xe2\x80\x94bitter herbs,\r\nand no bread with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, clasping her hands and pressing them\r\ntight, as she looked pleadingly at Fra Girolamo; \xe2\x80\x9cif you knew what it\r\nwas to me\xe2\x80\x94how impossible it seemed to me to bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the cord round Romola\xe2\x80\x99s neck, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ncarry something within your mantle; draw it forth, and look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola gave a slight start, but her impulse now was to do just what\r\nSavonarola told her. Her self-doubt was grappled by a stronger will and\r\na stronger conviction than her own. She drew forth the crucifix. Still\r\npointing towards it, he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, my daughter, is the image of a Supreme Offering, made by\r\nSupreme Love, because the need of man was great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and she held the crucifix trembling\xe2\x80\x94trembling under a sudden\r\nimpression of the wide distance between her present and her past self.\r\nWhat a length of road she had travelled through since she first took\r\nthat crucifix from the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s hands! Had life as many secrets before\r\nher still as it had for her then, in her young blindness? It was a\r\nthought that helped all other subduing influences; and at the sound of\r\nFra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s voice again, Romola, with a quick involuntary movement,\r\npressed the crucifix against her mantle and looked at him with more\r\nsubmission than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConform your life to that image, my daughter; make your sorrow an\r\noffering: and when the fire of Divine charity burns within you, and you\r\nbehold the need of your fellow-men by the light of that flame, you will\r\nnot call your offering great. You have carried yourself proudly, as one\r\nwho held herself not of common blood or of common thoughts; but you\r\nhave been as one unborn to the true life of man. What! you say your\r\nlove for your father no longer tells you to stay in Florence? Then,\r\nsince that tie is snapped, you are without a law, without religion: you\r\nare no better than a beast of the field when she is robbed of her\r\nyoung. If the yearning of a fleshly love is gone, you are without love,\r\nwithout obligation. See, then, my daughter, how you are below the life\r\nof the believer who worships that image of the Supreme Offering, and\r\nfeels the glow of a common life with the lost multitude for whom that\r\noffering was made, and beholds the history of the world as the history\r\nof a great redemption in which he is himself a fellow-worker, in his\r\nown place and among his own people! If you held that faith, my beloved\r\ndaughter, you would not be a wanderer flying from suffering, and\r\nblindly seeking the good of a freedom which is lawlessness. You would\r\nfeel that Florence was the home of your soul as well as your\r\nbirthplace, because you would see the work that was given you to do\r\nthere. If you forsake your place, who will fill it? You ought to be in\r\nyour place now, helping in the great work by which God will purify\r\nFlorence, and raise it to be the guide of the nations. What! the earth\r\nis full of iniquity\xe2\x80\x94full of groans\xe2\x80\x94the light is still struggling with a\r\nmighty darkness, and you say, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot bear my bonds; I will burst\r\nthem asunder; I will go where no man claims me\xe2\x80\x99? My daughter, every\r\nbond of your life is a debt: the right lies in the payment of that\r\ndebt; it can lie nowhere else. In vain will you wander over the earth;\r\nyou will be wandering for ever away from the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola was inwardly struggling with strong forces: that immense\r\npersonal influence of Savonarola, which came from the energy of his\r\nemotions and beliefs: and her consciousness, surmounting all prejudice,\r\nthat his words implied a higher law than any she had yet obeyed. But\r\nthe resisting thoughts were not yet overborne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, then, could Dino be right? He broke ties. He forsook his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a special vocation. He was constrained to depart, else he\r\ncould not have attained the higher life. It would have been stifled\r\nwithin him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, raising her hands to her brow, and speaking\r\nin a tone of anguish, as if she were being dragged to some torture.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, you may be wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk your conscience, my daughter. You have no vocation such as your\r\nbrother had. You are a wife. You seek to break your ties in self-will\r\nand anger, not because the higher life calls upon you to renounce them.\r\nThe higher life begins for us, my daughter, when we renounce our own\r\nwill to bow before a Divine law. That seems hard to you. It is the\r\nportal of wisdom, and freedom, and blessedness. And the symbol of it\r\nhangs before you. That wisdom is the religion of the Cross. And you\r\nstand aloof from it: you are a pagan; you have been taught to say, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam as the wise men who lived before the time when the Jew of Nazareth\r\nwas crucified.\xe2\x80\x99 And that is your wisdom! To be as the dead whose eyes\r\nare closed, and whose ear is deaf to the work of God that has been\r\nsince their time. What has your dead wisdom done for you, my daughter?\r\nIt has left you without a heart for the neighbours among whom you\r\ndwell, without care for the great work by which Florence is to be\r\nregenerated and the world made holy; it has left you without a share in\r\nthe Divine life which quenches the sense of suffering Self in the\r\nardours of an ever-growing love. And now, when the sword has pierced\r\nyour soul, you say, \xe2\x80\x98I will go away; I cannot bear my sorrow.\xe2\x80\x99 And you\r\nthink nothing of the sorrow and the wrong that are within the walls of\r\nthe city where you dwell: you would leave your place empty, when it\r\nought to be filled with your pity and your labour. If there is\r\nwickedness in the streets, your steps should shine with the light of\r\npurity; if there is a cry of anguish, you, my daughter, because you\r\nknow the meaning of the cry, should be there to still it. My beloved\r\ndaughter, sorrow has come to teach you a new worship: the sign of it\r\nhangs before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s mind was still torn by conflict. She foresaw that she should\r\nobey Savonarola and go back: his words had come to her as if they were\r\nan interpretation of that revulsion from self-satisfied ease, and of\r\nthat new fellowship with suffering, which had already been awakened in\r\nher. His arresting voice had brought a new condition into her life,\r\nwhich made it seem impossible to her that she could go on her way as if\r\nshe had not heard it; yet she shrank as one who sees the path she must\r\ntake, but sees, too, that the hot lava lies there. And the instinctive\r\nshrinking from a return to her husband brought doubts. She turned away\r\nher eyes from Fra Girolamo, and stood for a minute or two with her\r\nhands hanging clasped before her, like a statue. At last she spoke, as\r\nif the words were being wrung from her, still looking on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband... he is not... my love is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, there is the bond of a higher love. Marriage is not\r\ncarnal only, made for selfish delight. See what that thought leads you\r\nto! It leads you to wander away in a false garb from all the\r\nobligations of your place and name. That would not have been, if you\r\nhad learned that it is a sacramental vow, from which none but God can\r\nrelease you. My daughter, your life is not as a grain of sand, to be\r\nblown by the winds; it is a thing of flesh and blood, that dies if it\r\nbe sundered. Your husband is not a malefactor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola started. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid! No; I accuse him of nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not suppose he was a malefactor. I meant, that if he were a\r\nmalefactor, your place would be in the prison beside him. My daughter,\r\nif the cross comes to you as a wife, you must carry it as a wife. You\r\nmay say, \xe2\x80\x98I will forsake my husband,\xe2\x80\x99 but you cannot cease to be a\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet if\xe2\x80\x94oh, how could I bear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Romola had involuntarily begun to say\r\nsomething which she sought to banish from her mind again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake your marriage-sorrows an offering too, my daughter: an offering\r\nto the great work by which sin and sorrow are being made to cease. The\r\nend is sure, and is already beginning. Here in Florence it is\r\nbeginning, and the eyes of faith behold it. And it may be our\r\nblessedness to die for it: to die daily by the crucifixion of our\r\nselfish will\xe2\x80\x94to die at last by laying our bodies on the altar. My\r\ndaughter, you are a child of Florence; fulfil the duties of that great\r\ninheritance. Live for Florence\xe2\x80\x94for your own people, whom God is\r\npreparing to bless the earth. Bear the anguish and the smart. The iron\r\nis sharp\xe2\x80\x94I know, I know\xe2\x80\x94it rends the tender flesh. The draught is\r\nbitterness on the lips. But there is rapture in the cup\xe2\x80\x94there is the\r\nvision which makes all life below it dross for ever. Come, my daughter,\r\ncome back to your place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Savonarola spoke with growing intensity, his arms tightly folded\r\nbefore him still, as they had been from the first, but his face alight\r\nas from an inward flame, Romola felt herself surrounded and possessed\r\nby the glow of his passionate faith. The chill doubts all melted away;\r\nshe was subdued by the sense of something unspeakably great to which\r\nshe was being called by a strong being who roused a new strength within\r\nherself. In a voice that was like a low, prayerful cry, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I will be guided. Teach me! I will go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost unconsciously she sank on her knees. Savonarola stretched out\r\nhis hands over her; but feeling would no longer pass through the\r\nchannel of speech, and he was silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nComing Back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fra Girolamo at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYour servant is\r\nwaiting not far off with the mules. It is time that I should go onward\r\nto Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola arose from her knees. That silent attitude had been a sort of\r\nsacrament to her, confirming the state of yearning passivity on which\r\nshe had newly entered. By the one act of renouncing her resolve to quit\r\nher husband, her will seemed so utterly bruised that she felt the need\r\nof direction even in small things. She lifted up the edge of her cowl,\r\nand saw Maso and the second Dominican standing with their backs towards\r\nher on the edge of the hill about ten yards from her; but she looked at\r\nSavonarola again without speaking, as if the order to Maso to turn back\r\nmust come from him and not from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go and call them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, answering her glance of appeal;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I will recommend you, my daughter, to the Brother who is with me.\r\nYou desire to put yourself under guidance, and to learn that wisdom\r\nwhich has been hitherto as foolishness to you. A chief gate of that\r\nwisdom is the sacrament of confession. You will need a confessor, my\r\ndaughter, and I desire to put you under the care of Fra Salvestro, one\r\nof the brethren of San Marco, in whom I most confide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather have no guidance but yours, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nlooking anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, I do not act as a confessor. The vocation I have\r\nwithdraws me from offices that would force me into frequent contact\r\nwith the laity, and interfere with my special duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen shall I not be able to speak to you in private? if I waver, if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRomola broke off from rising agitation. She felt a sudden alarm lest\r\nher new strength in renunciation should vanish if the immediate\r\npersonal influence of Savonarola vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, if your soul has need of the word in private from my\r\nlips, you will let me know it through Fra Salvestro, and I will see you\r\nin the sacristy or in the choir of San Marco. And I will not cease to\r\nwatch over you. I will instruct my brother concerning you, that he may\r\nguide you into that path of labour for the suffering and the hungry to\r\nwhich you are called as a daughter of Florence in these times of hard\r\nneed. I desire to behold you among the feebler and more ignorant\r\nsisters as the apple-tree among the trees of the forest, so that your\r\nfairness and all natural gifts may be but as a lamp through which the\r\nDivine light shines the more purely. I will go now and call your\r\nservant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Maso had been sent a little way in advance, Fra Salvestro came\r\nforward, and Savonarola led Romola towards him. She had beforehand felt\r\nan inward shrinking from a new guide who was a total stranger to her:\r\nbut to have resisted Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s advice would have been to assume an\r\nattitude of independence at a moment when all her strength must be\r\ndrawn from the renunciation of independence. And the whole bent of her\r\nmind now was towards doing what was painful rather than what was easy.\r\nShe bowed reverently to Fra Salvestro before looking directly at him;\r\nbut when she raised her head and saw him fully, her reluctance became a\r\npalpitating doubt. There are men whose presence infuses trust and\r\nreverence; there are others to whom we have need to carry our trust and\r\nreverence ready-made; and that difference flashed on Romola as she\r\nceased to have Savonarola before her, and saw in his stead Fra\r\nSalvestro Maruffi. It was not that there was anything manifestly\r\nrepulsive in Fra Salvestro\xe2\x80\x99s face and manner, any air of hypocrisy, any\r\ntinge of coarseness; his face was handsomer than Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s, his\r\nperson a little taller. He was the long-accepted confessor of many\r\namong the chief personages in Florence, and had therefore had large\r\nexperience as a spiritual director. But his face had the vacillating\r\nexpression of a mind unable to concentrate itself strongly in the\r\nchannel of one great emotion or belief\xe2\x80\x94an expression which is fatal to\r\ninfluence over an ardent nature like Romola\xe2\x80\x99s. Such an expression is\r\nnot the stamp of insincerity; it is the stamp simply of a shallow soul,\r\nwhich will often be found sincerely striving to fill a high vocation,\r\nsincerely composing its countenance to the utterance of sublime\r\nformulas, but finding the muscles twitch or relax in spite of belief,\r\nas prose insists on coming instead of poetry to the man who has not the\r\ndivine frenzy. Fra Salvestro had a peculiar liability to visions,\r\ndependent apparently on a constitution given to somnambulism.\r\nSavonarola believed in the supernatural character of these visions,\r\nwhile Fra Salvestro himself had originally resisted such an\r\ninterpretation of them, and had even rebuked Savonarola for his\r\nprophetic preaching: another proof, if one were wanted, that the\r\nrelative greatness of men is not to be gauged by their tendency to\r\ndisbelieve the superstitions of their age. For of these two there can\r\nbe no question which was the great man and which the small.\r\n\r\nThe difference between them was measured very accurately by the change\r\nin Romola\xe2\x80\x99s feeling as Fra Salvestro began to address her in words of\r\nexhortation and encouragement. After her first angry resistance of\r\nSavonarola had passed away, she had lost all remembrance of the old\r\ndread lest any influence should drag her within the circle of\r\nfanaticism and sour monkish piety. But now again, the chill breath of\r\nthat dread stole over her. It could have no decisive effect against the\r\nimpetus her mind had just received; it was only like the closing of the\r\ngrey clouds over the sunrise, which made her returning path monotonous\r\nand sombre.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps of all sombre paths that on which we go back after treading\r\nit with a strong resolution is the one that most severely tests the\r\nfervour of renunciation. As they re-entered the city gates the light\r\nsnow-flakes fell about them; and as the grey sister walked hastily\r\nhomeward from the Piazza di San Marco, and trod the bridge again, and\r\nturned in at the large door in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, her footsteps were\r\nmarked darkly on the thin carpet of snow, and her cowl fell laden and\r\ndamp about her face.\r\n\r\nShe went up to her room, threw off her serge, destroyed the parting\r\nletters, replaced all her precious trifles, unbound her hair, and put\r\non her usual black dress. Instead of taking a long exciting journey,\r\nshe was to sit down in her usual place. The snow fell against the\r\nwindows, and she was alone.\r\n\r\nShe felt the dreariness, yet her courage was high, like that of a\r\nseeker who has come on new signs of gold. She was going to thread life\r\nby a fresh clue. She had thrown all the energy of her will into\r\nrenunciation. The empty tabernacle remained locked, and she placed\r\nDino\xe2\x80\x99s crucifix outside it.\r\n\r\nNothing broke the outward monotony of her solitary home, till the night\r\ncame like a white ghost at the windows. Yet it was the most memorable\r\nChristmas-eve in her life to Romola, this of 1494.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nRomola in her Place.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the thirtieth of October 1496. The sky that morning was clear\r\nenough, and there was a pleasant autumnal breeze. But the Florentines\r\njust then thought very little about the land breezes: they were\r\nthinking of the gales at sea, which seemed to be uniting with all other\r\npowers to disprove the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that Heaven took special\r\ncare of Florence.\r\n\r\nFor those terrible gales had driven away from the coast of Leghorn\r\ncertain ships from Marseilles, freighted with soldiery and corn; and\r\nFlorence was in the direst need, first of food, and secondly of\r\nfighting men. Pale Famine was in her streets, and her territory was\r\nthreatened on all its borders.\r\n\r\nFor the French king, that new Charlemagne, who had entered Italy in\r\nanticipatory triumph, and had conquered Naples without the least\r\ntrouble, had gone away again fifteen months ago, and was even, it was\r\nfeared, in his grief for the loss of a new-born son, losing the languid\r\nintention of coming back again to redress grievances and set the Church\r\nin order. A league had been formed against him\xe2\x80\x94a Holy League, with Pope\r\nBorgia at its head\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9cdrive out the barbarians,\xe2\x80\x9d who still garrisoned\r\nthe fortress of Naples. That had a patriotic sound; but, looked at more\r\nclosely, the Holy League seemed very much like an agreement among\r\ncertain wolves to drive away all other wolves, and then to see which\r\namong themselves could snatch the largest share of the prey. And there\r\nwas a general disposition to regard Florence not as a fellow-wolf, but\r\nrather as a desirable carcass. Florence, therefore, of all the chief\r\nItalian States, had alone declined to join the League, adhering still\r\nto the French alliance.\r\n\r\nShe had declined at her peril. At this moment Pisa, still fighting\r\nsavagely for liberty, was being encouraged not only by strong forces\r\nfrom Venice and Milan, but by the presence of the German Emperor\r\nMaximilian, who had been invited by the League, and was joining the\r\nPisans with such troops as he had in the attempt to get possession of\r\nLeghorn, while the coast was invested by Venetian and Genoese ships.\r\nAnd if Leghorn should fall into the hands of the enemy, woe to\r\nFlorence! For if that one outlet towards the sea were closed, hedged in\r\nas she was on the land by the bitter ill-will of the Pope and the\r\njealousy of smaller States, how could succours reach her?\r\n\r\nThe government of Florence had shown a great heart in this urgent need,\r\nmeeting losses and defeats with vigorous effort, raising fresh money,\r\nraising fresh soldiers, but not neglecting the good old method of\r\nItalian defence\xe2\x80\x94conciliatory embassies. And while the scarcity of food\r\nwas every day becoming greater, they had resolved, in opposition to old\r\nprecedent, not to shut out the starving country people, and the\r\nmendicants driven from the gates of other cities, who came flocking to\r\nFlorence like birds from a land of snow.\r\n\r\nThese acts of a government in which the disciples of Savonarola made\r\nthe strongest element were not allowed to pass without criticism. The\r\ndisaffected were plentiful, and they saw clearly that the government\r\ntook the worst course for the public welfare. Florence ought to join\r\nthe League and make common cause with the other great Italian States,\r\ninstead of drawing down their hostility by a futile adherence to a\r\nforeign ally. Florence ought to take care of her own citizens, instead\r\nof opening her gates to famine and pestilence in the shape of starving\r\ncontadini and alien mendicants.\r\n\r\nEvery day the distress became sharper: every day the murmurs became\r\nlouder. And, to crown the difficulties of the government, for a month\r\nand more\xe2\x80\x94in obedience to a mandate from Rome\xe2\x80\x94Fra Girolamo had ceased to\r\npreach. But on the arrival of the terrible news that the ships from\r\nMarseilles had been driven back, and that no corn was coming, the need\r\nfor the voice that could infuse faith and patience into the people\r\nbecame too imperative to be resisted. In defiance of the Papal mandate\r\nthe Signoria requested Savonarola to preach. And two days ago he had\r\nmounted again the pulpit of the Duomo, and had told the people only to\r\nwait and be steadfast and the divine help would certainly come.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold sermon: he consented to have his frock stripped off him\r\nif, when Florence persevered in fulfilling the duties of piety and\r\ncitizenship, God did not come to her rescue.\r\n\r\nYet at present, on this morning of the thirtieth, there were no signs\r\nof rescue. Perhaps if the precious Tabernacle of the Madonna dell\xe2\x80\x99\r\nImpruneta were brought into Florence and carried in devout procession\r\nto the Duomo, that Mother, rich in sorrows and therefore in mercy,\r\nwould plead for the suffering city? For a century and a half there were\r\nrecords how the Florentines, suffering from drought, or flood, or\r\nfamine, or pestilence, or the threat of wars, had fetched the potent\r\nimage within their walls, and had found deliverance. And grateful\r\nhonour had been done to her and her ancient church of L\xe2\x80\x99Impruneta; the\r\nhigh house of Buondelmonti, patrons of the church, had to guard her\r\nhidden image with bare sword; wealth had been poured out for prayers at\r\nher shrine, for chantings, and chapels, and ever-burning lights; and\r\nlands had been added, till there was much quarrelling for the privilege\r\nof serving her. The Florentines were deeply convinced of her\r\ngraciousness to them, so that the sight of her tabernacle within their\r\nwalls was like the parting of the cloud, and the proverb ran, that the\r\nFlorentines had a Madonna who would do what they pleased.\r\n\r\nWhen were they in more need of her pleading pity than now? And already,\r\nthe evening before, the tabernacle containing the miraculous hidden\r\nimage had been brought with high and reverend escort from L\xe2\x80\x99Impruneta,\r\nthe privileged spot six miles beyond the gate of San Piero that looks\r\ntowards Rome, and had been deposited in the church of San Gaggio,\r\noutside the gate, whence it was to be fetched in solemn procession by\r\nall the fraternities, trades, and authorities of Florence.\r\n\r\nBut the Pitying Mother had not yet entered within the walls, and the\r\nmorning arose on unchanged misery and despondency. Pestilence was\r\nhovering in the track of famine. Not only the hospitals were full, but\r\nthe courtyards of private houses had been turned into refuges and\r\ninfirmaries; and still there was unsheltered want. And early this\r\nmorning, as usual, members of the various fraternities who made it part\r\nof their duty to bury the unfriended dead, were bearing away the\r\ncorpses that had sunk by the wayside. As usual, sweet womanly forms,\r\nwith the refined air and carriage of the well-born, but in the plainest\r\ngarb, were moving about the streets on their daily errands of tending\r\nthe sick and relieving the hungry.\r\n\r\nOne of these forms was easily distinguishable as Romola de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi. Clad\r\nin the simplest garment of black serge, with a plain piece of black\r\ndrapery drawn over her head, so as to hide all her hair, except the\r\nbands of gold that rippled apart on her brow, she was advancing from\r\nthe Ponte Vecchio towards the Por\xe2\x80\x99 Santa Maria\xe2\x80\x94the street in a direct\r\nline with the bridge\xe2\x80\x94when she found her way obstructed by the pausing\r\nof a bier, which was being carried by members of the company of San\r\nJacopo del Popolo, in search for the unburied dead. The brethren at the\r\nhead of the bier were stooping to examine something, while a group of\r\nidle workmen, with features paled and sharpened by hunger, were\r\nclustering around and all talking at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead, I tell you! Messer Domeneddio has loved him well enough to\r\ntake him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and it would be well for us all if we could have our legs\r\nstretched out and go with our heads two or three _bracci_ foremost!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s ill standing upright with hunger to prop you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s an old fellow. Death has got a poor bargain. Life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad the best of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no Florentine, ten to one! A beggar turned out of Siena. San\r\nGiovanni defend us! They\xe2\x80\x99ve no need of soldiers to fight us. They send\r\nus an army of starving men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! This man is one of the prisoners turned out of the Stinche. I\r\nknow by the grey patch where the prison badge was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet! Lend a hand! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see the brethren are going to lift\r\nhim on the bier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s likely he\xe2\x80\x99s alive enough if he could only look it. The soul may\r\nbe inside him if it had only a drop of _vernaccia_ to warm it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, I think he is not dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the brethren, when they\r\nhad lifted him on the bier. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has perhaps only sunk down for want of\r\nfood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me try to give him some wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, coming forward. She\r\nloosened the small flask which she carried at her belt, and, leaning\r\ntowards the prostrate body, with a deft hand she applied a small ivory\r\nimplement between the teeth, and poured into the mouth a few drops of\r\nwine. The stimulus acted: the wine was evidently swallowed. She poured\r\nmore, till the head was moved a little towards her, and the eyes of the\r\nold man opened full upon her with the vague look of returning\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time a sense of complete recognition came over\r\nRomola. Those wild dark eyes opening in the sallow deep-lined face,\r\nwith the white beard, which was now long again, were like an\r\nunmistakable signature to a remembered handwriting. The light of two\r\nsummers had not made that image any fainter in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s memory: the\r\nimage of the escaped prisoner, whom she had seen in the Duomo the day\r\nwhen Tito first wore the armour\xe2\x80\x94at whose grasp Tito was paled with\r\nterror in the strange sketch she had seen in Piero\xe2\x80\x99s studio. A wretched\r\ntremor and palpitation seized her. Now at last, perhaps, she was going\r\nto know some secret which might be more bitter than all that had gone\r\nbefore. She felt an impulse to dart away as from a sight of horror; and\r\nagain, a more imperious need to keep close by the side of this old man\r\nwhom, the divination of keen feeling told her, her husband had injured.\r\nIn the very instant of this conflict she still leaned towards him and\r\nkept her right-hand ready to administer more wine, while her left was\r\npassed under his neck. Her hands trembled, but their habit of soothing\r\nhelpfulness would have served to guide them without the direction of\r\nher thought.\r\n\r\nBaldassarre was looking at _her_ for the first time. The close\r\nseclusion in which Romola\xe2\x80\x99s trouble had kept her in the weeks preceding\r\nher flight and his arrest, had denied him the opportunity he had sought\r\nof seeing the Wife who lived in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi: and at this moment\r\nthe descriptions he had heard of the fair golden-haired woman were all\r\ngone, like yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it not be well to carry him to the steps of San Stefano?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRomola. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall cease then to stop up the street, and you can go on\r\nyour way with your bier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had only to move onward for about thirty yards before reaching the\r\nsteps of San Stefano, and by this time Baldassarre was able himself to\r\nmake some efforts towards getting off the bier, and propping himself on\r\nthe steps against the church-doorway. The charitable brethren passed\r\non, but the group of interested spectators, who had nothing to do and\r\nmuch to say, had considerably increased. The feeling towards the old\r\nman was not so entirely friendly now it was quite certain that he was\r\nalive, but the respect inspired by Romola\xe2\x80\x99s presence caused the passing\r\nremarks to be made in a rather more subdued tone than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, they gave him his morsel every day in the Stinche\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do so well without it. You and I, Cecco, know better what it is\r\nto go to bed fasting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Gnaff\xc3\xa8_! that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Magnificent Eight have turned out some of the\r\nprisoners, that they may shelter honest people instead. But if every\r\nthief is to be brought to life with good wine and wheaten bread, we\r\nCiompi had better go and fill ourselves in Arno while the water\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola had seated herself on the steps by Baldassarre, and was saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you eat a little bread now? perhaps by-and-by you will be able, if\r\nI leave it with you. I must go on, because I have promised to be at the\r\nhospital. But I will come back if you will wait here, and then I will\r\ntake you to some shelter. Do you understand? Will you wait? I will come\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked dreamily at her, and repeated her words, \xe2\x80\x9ccome back.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nno wonder that his mind was enfeebled by his bodily exhaustion, but she\r\nhoped that he apprehended her meaning. She opened her basket, which was\r\nfilled with pieces of soft bread, and put one of the pieces into his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you keep your bread for those that can\xe2\x80\x99t swallow, madonna?\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nrough-looking fellow, in a red night-cap, who had elbowed his way into\r\nthe inmost circle of spectators\xe2\x80\x94a circle that was pressing rather\r\nclosely on Romola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anybody isn\xe2\x80\x99t hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, let him alone. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbetter off than people who\xe2\x80\x99ve got craving stomachs and no breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed; if a man\xe2\x80\x99s a mind to die, it\xe2\x80\x99s a time to encourage him,\r\ninstead of making him come back to life against his will. Dead men want\r\nno trencher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s charity,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young man in an\r\nexcellent cloth tunic, whose face showed no signs of want. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Frate\r\nhas been preaching to the birds, like Saint Anthony, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\ntelling the hawks they were made to feed the sparrows, as every good\r\nFlorentine citizen was made to feed six starving beggar-men from Arezzo\r\nor Bologna. Madonna, there, is a pious Piagnone: she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to\r\nthrow away her good bread on honest citizens who\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprophecies to swallow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the red cap, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old thief doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat the\r\nbread, you see: you\xe2\x80\x99d better try _us_. We fast so much, we\xe2\x80\x99re half\r\nsaints already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe circle had narrowed till the coarse men\xe2\x80\x94most of them gaunt from\r\nprivation\xe2\x80\x94had left hardly any margin round Romola. She had been taking\r\nfrom her basket a small horn-cup, into which she put the piece of bread\r\nand just moistened it with wine; and hitherto she had not appeared to\r\nheed them. But now she rose to her feet, and looked round at them.\r\nInstinctively the men who were nearest to her pushed backward a little,\r\nas if their rude nearness were the fault of those behind. Romola held\r\nout the basket of bread to the man in the night-cap, looking at him\r\nwithout any reproach in her glance, as she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHunger is hard to bear, I know, and you have the power to take this\r\nbread if you will. It was saved for sick women and children. You are\r\nstrong men; but if you do not choose to suffer because you are strong,\r\nyou have the power to take everything from the weak. You can take the\r\nbread from this basket; but I shall watch by this old man; I shall\r\nresist your taking the bread from _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was perfect silence, while Romola looked at the\r\nfaces before her, and held out the basket of bread. Her own pale face\r\nhad the slightly pinched look and the deepening of the eye-socket which\r\nindicate unusual fasting in the habitually temperate, and the large\r\ndirect gaze of her hazel eyes was all the more impressive.\r\n\r\nThe man in the night-cap looked rather silly, and backed, thrusting his\r\nelbow into his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s ribs with an air of moral rebuke. The\r\nbacking was general, every one wishing to imply that he had been pushed\r\nforward against his will; and the young man in the fine cloth tunic had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment the armed servitors of the Signoria, who had begun\r\nto patrol the line of streets through which the procession was to pass,\r\ncame up to disperse the group which was obstructing the narrow street.\r\nThe man addressed as Cecco retreated from a threatening mace up the\r\nchurch-steps, and said to Romola, in a respectful tone\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadonna, if you want to go on your errands, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of the old\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCecco was a wild-looking figure: a very ragged tunic, made shaggy and\r\nvariegated by cloth-dust and clinging fragments of wool, gave relief to\r\na pair of bare bony arms and a long sinewy neck; his square jaw shaded\r\nby a bristly black beard, his bridgeless nose and low forehead, made\r\nhis face look as if it had been crushed down for purposes of packing,\r\nand a narrow piece of red rag tied over his ears seemed to assist in\r\nthe compression. Romola looked at him with some hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t distrust me, madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cecco, who understood her look\r\nperfectly; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not so pretty as you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an old mother who\r\neats my porridge for me. What! there\xe2\x80\x99s a heart inside me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbought a candle for the most Holy Virgin before now. Besides, see\r\nthere, the old fellow is eating his sop. He\xe2\x80\x99s hale enough: he\xe2\x80\x99ll be on\r\nhis legs as well as the best of us by-and-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for offering to take care of him, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nrather penitent for her doubting glance. Then leaning to Baldassarre,\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cPray wait for me till I come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe assented with a slight movement of the head and hand, and Romola\r\nwent on her way towards the hospital of San Matteo, in the Piazza di\r\nSan Marco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nThe Unseen Madonna.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn returning from the hospital, more than an hour later, Romola took a\r\ndifferent road, making a wider circuit towards the river, which she\r\nreached at some distance from the Ponte Vecchio. She turned her steps\r\ntowards that bridge, intending to hasten to San Stefano in search of\r\nBaldassarre. She dreaded to know more about him, yet she felt as if, in\r\nforsaking him, she would be forsaking some near claim upon her.\r\n\r\nBut when she approached the meeting of the roads where the Por\xe2\x80\x99 Santa\r\nMaria would be on her right-hand and the Ponte Vecchio on her left, she\r\nfound herself involved in a crowd who suddenly fell on their knees; and\r\nshe immediately knelt with them. The Cross was passing\xe2\x80\x94the Great Cross\r\nof the Duomo\xe2\x80\x94which headed the procession. Romola was later than she had\r\nexpected to be, and now she must wait till the procession had passed.\r\nAs she rose from her knees, when the Cross had disappeared, the return\r\nto a standing posture, with nothing to do but gaze, made her more\r\nconscious of her fatigue than she had been while she had been walking\r\nand occupied. A shopkeeper by her side said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadonna Romola, you will be weary of standing: Gian Fantoni will be\r\nglad to give you a seat in his house. Here is his door close at hand.\r\nLet me open it for you. What! he loves God and the Frate as we do. His\r\nhouse is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola was accustomed now to be addressed in this fraternal way by\r\nordinary citizens, whose faces were familiar to her from her having\r\nseen them constantly in the Duomo. The idea of home had come to be\r\nidentified for her less with the house in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, where she\r\nsat in frequent loneliness, than with the towered circuit of Florence,\r\nwhere there was hardly a turn of the streets at which she was not\r\ngreeted with looks of appeal or of friendliness. She was glad enough to\r\npass through the open door on her right-hand and be led by the\r\nfraternal hose-vendor to an upstairs-window, where a stout woman with\r\nthree children, all in the plain garb of Piagnoni, made a place for her\r\nwith much reverence above the bright hanging draperies. From this\r\ncorner station she could see, not only the procession pouring in solemn\r\nslowness between the lines of houses on the Ponte Vecchio, but also the\r\nriver and the Lung\xe2\x80\x99 Arno on towards the bridge of the Santa Trinita.\r\n\r\nIn sadness and in stillness came the slow procession. Not even a\r\nwailing chant broke the silent appeal for mercy: there was only the\r\ntramp of footsteps, and the faint sweep of woollen garments. They were\r\nyoung footsteps that were passing when Romola first looked from the\r\nwindow\xe2\x80\x94a long train of the Florentine youth, bearing high in the midst\r\nof them the white image of the youthful Jesus, with a golden glory\r\nabove his head, standing by the tall cross where the thorns and the\r\nnails lay ready.\r\n\r\nAfter that train of fresh beardless faces came the mysterious-looking\r\nCompanies of Discipline, bound by secret rules to self-chastisement,\r\nand devout praise, and special acts of piety; all wearing a garb which\r\nconcealed the whole head and face except the eyes. Every one knew that\r\nthese mysterious forms were Florentine citizens of various ranks, who\r\nmight be seen at ordinary times going about the business of the shop,\r\nthe counting-house, or the State; but no member now was discernible as\r\nson, husband, or father. They had dropped their personality, and walked\r\nas symbols of a common vow. Each company had its colour and its badge,\r\nbut the garb of all was a complete shroud, and left no expression but\r\nthat of fellowship.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with them, the multitude of monks seemed to be strongly\r\ndistinguished individuals, in spite of the common tonsure and the\r\ncommon frock. First came a white stream of reformed Benedictines; and\r\nthen a much longer stream of the Frati Minori, or Franciscans, in that\r\nage all clad in grey, with the knotted cord round their waists, and\r\nsome of them with the _zoccoli_, or wooden sandals, below their bare\r\nfeet;\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the most numerous order in Florence, owning many zealous\r\nmembers who loved mankind and hated the Dominicans. And after the grey\r\ncame the black of the Augustinians of San Spirito with more cultured\r\nhuman faces above it\xe2\x80\x94men who had inherited the library of Boccaccio,\r\nand had made the most learned company in Florence when learning was\r\nrarer; then the white over dark of the Carmelites; and then again the\r\nunmixed black of the Servites, that famous Florentine order founded by\r\nseven merchants who forsook their gains to adore the Divine Mother.\r\n\r\nAnd now the hearts of all onlookers began to beat a little faster,\r\neither with hatred or with love, for there was a stream of black and\r\nwhite coming over the bridge\xe2\x80\x94of black mantles over white scapularies;\r\nand every one knew that the Dominicans were coming. Those of Fiesole\r\npassed first. One black mantle parted by white after another, one\r\ntonsured head after another, and still expectation was suspended. They\r\nwere very coarse mantles, all of them, and many were threadbare, if not\r\nragged; for the Prior of San Marco had reduced the fraternities under\r\nhis rule to the strictest poverty and discipline. But in the long line\r\nof black and white there was at last singled out a mantle only a little\r\nmore worn than the rest, with a tonsured head above it which might not\r\nhave appeared supremely remarkable to a stranger who had not seen it on\r\nbronze medals, with the sword of God as its obverse; or surrounded by\r\nan armed guard on the way to the Duomo; or transfigured by the inward\r\nflame of the orator as it looked round on a rapt multitude.\r\n\r\nAs the approach of Savonarola was discerned, none dared conspicuously\r\nto break the stillness by a sound which would rise above the solemn\r\ntramp of footsteps and the faint sweep of garments; nevertheless his\r\near, as well as other ears, caught a mingled sound of slow hissing that\r\nlonged to be curses, and murmurs that longed to be blessings. Perhaps\r\nit was the sense that the hissing predominated which made two or three\r\nof his disciples in the foreground of the crowd, at the meeting of the\r\nroads, fall on their knees as if something divine were passing. The\r\nmovement of silent homage spread: it went along the sides of the\r\nstreets like a subtle shock, leaving some unmoved, while it made the\r\nmost bend the knee and bow the head. But the hatred, too, gathered a\r\nmore intense expression; and as Savonarola passed up the Por\xe2\x80\x99 Santa\r\nMaria, Romola could see that some one at an upper window spat upon him.\r\n\r\nMonks again\xe2\x80\x94Frati Umiliati, or Humbled Brethren, from Ognissanti, with\r\na glorious tradition of being the earliest workers in the wool-trade;\r\nand again more monks\xe2\x80\x94Vallombrosan and other varieties of Benedictines,\r\nreminding the instructed eye by niceties of form and colour that in\r\nages of abuse, long ago, reformers had arisen who had marked a change\r\nof spirit by a change of garb; till at last the shaven crowns were at\r\nan end, and there came the train of untonsured secular priests.\r\n\r\nThen followed the twenty-one incorporated Arts of Florence in long\r\narray, with their banners floating above them in proud declaration that\r\nthe bearers had their distinct functions, from the bakers of bread to\r\nthe judges and notaries. And then all the secondary officers of State,\r\nbeginning with the less and going on to the greater, till the line of\r\nsecularities was broken by the Canons of the Duomo, carrying a sacred\r\nrelic\xe2\x80\x94the very head, enclosed in silver, of San Zenobio, immortal\r\nbishop of Florence, whose virtues were held to have saved the city\r\nperhaps a thousand years before.\r\n\r\nHere was the nucleus of the procession. Behind the relic came the\r\narchbishop in gorgeous cope, with canopy held above him; and after him\r\nthe mysterious hidden Image\xe2\x80\x94hidden first by rich curtains of brocade\r\nenclosing an outer painted tabernacle, but within this, by the more\r\nancient tabernacle which had never been opened in the memory of living\r\nmen, or the fathers of living men. In that inner shrine was the image\r\nof the Pitying Mother, found ages ago in the soil of L\xe2\x80\x99Impruneta,\r\nuttering a cry as the spade struck it. Hitherto the unseen Image had\r\nhardly ever been carried to the Duomo without having rich gifts borne\r\nbefore it. There was no reciting the list of precious offerings made by\r\nemulous men and communities, especially of veils and curtains and\r\nmantles. But the richest of all these, it was said, had been given by a\r\npoor abbess and her nuns, who, having no money to buy materials, wove a\r\nmantle of gold brocade with their prayers, embroidered it and adorned\r\nit with their prayers, and, finally, saw their work presented to the\r\nBlessed Virgin in the great Piazza by two beautiful youths who spread\r\nout white wings and vanished in the blue.\r\n\r\nBut to-day there were no gifts carried before the tabernacle: no\r\ndonations were to be given to-day except to the poor. That had been the\r\nadvice of Fra Girolamo, whose preaching never insisted on gifts to the\r\ninvisible powers, but only on help to visible need; and altars had been\r\nraised at various points in front of the churches, on which the\r\noblations for the poor were deposited. Not even a torch was carried.\r\nSurely the hidden Mother cared less for torches and brocade than for\r\nthe wail of the hungry people. Florence was in extremity: she had done\r\nher utmost, and could only wait for something divine that was not in\r\nher own power.\r\n\r\nThe Frate in the torn mantle had said that help would certainly come,\r\nand many of the faint-hearted were clinging more to their faith in the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s word, than to their faith in the virtues of the unseen Image.\r\nBut there were not a few of the fierce-hearted who thought with secret\r\nrejoicing that the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s word might be proved false.\r\n\r\nSlowly the tabernacle moved forward, and knees were bent. There was\r\nprofound stillness; for the train of priests and chaplains from\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99Impruneta stirred no passion in the onlookers. The procession was\r\nabout to close with the Priors and the Gonfaloniere: the long train of\r\ncompanies and symbols, which have their silent music and stir the mind\r\nas a chorus stirs it, was passing out of sight, and now a faint\r\nyearning hope was all that struggled with the accustomed despondency.\r\n\r\nRomola, whose heart had been swelling, half with foreboding, half with\r\nthat enthusiasm of fellowship which the life of the last two years had\r\nmade as habitual to her as the consciousness of costume to a vain and\r\nidle woman, gave a deep sigh, as at the end of some long mental\r\ntension, and remained on her knees for very languor; when suddenly\r\nthere flashed from between the houses on to the distant bridge\r\nsomething bright-coloured. In the instant, Romola started up and\r\nstretched out her arms, leaning from the window, while the black\r\ndrapery fell from her head, and the golden gleam of her hair and the\r\nflush in her face seemed the effect of one illumination. A shout arose\r\nin the same instant; the last troops of the procession paused, and all\r\nfaces were turned towards the distant bridge.\r\n\r\nBut the bridge was passed now: the horseman was pressing at full gallop\r\nalong by the Arno; the sides of his bay horse, just streaked with foam,\r\nlooked all white from swiftness; his cap was flying loose by his red\r\nbecchetto, and he waved an olive-branch in his hand. It was a\r\nmessenger\xe2\x80\x94a messenger of good tidings! The blessed olive-branch spoke\r\nafar off. But the impatient people could not wait. They rushed to meet\r\nthe on-comer, and seized his horse\xe2\x80\x99s rein, pushing and trampling.\r\n\r\nAnd now Romola could see that the horseman was her husband, who had\r\nbeen sent to Pisa a few days before on a private embassy. The\r\nrecognition brought no new flash of joy into her eyes. She had checked\r\nher first impulsive attitude of expectation; but her governing anxiety\r\nwas still to know what news of relief had come for Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood news!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBest news!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews to be paid with hose!\xe2\x80\x9d (_novelle da calze_) were the vague\r\nanswers with which Tito met the importunities of the crowd, until he\r\nhad succeeded in pushing on his horse to the spot at the meeting of the\r\nways where the Gonfaloniere and the Priors were awaiting him. There he\r\npaused, and, bowing low, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent Signori! I have to deliver to you the joyful news that the\r\ngalleys from France, laden with corn and men, have arrived safely in\r\nthe port of Leghorn, by favour of a strong wind, which kept the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfleet at a distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words had no sooner left Tito\xe2\x80\x99s lips than they seemed to vibrate up\r\nthe streets. A great shout rang through the air, and rushed along the\r\nriver; and then another, and another; and the shouts were heard\r\nspreading along the line of the procession towards the Duomo; and then\r\nthere were fainter answering shouts, like the intermediate plash of\r\ndistant waves in a great lake whose waters obey one impulse.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes there was no attempt to speak further: the Signoria\r\nthemselves lifted up their caps, and stood bare-headed in the presence\r\nof a rescue which had come from outside the limit of their own\r\npower\xe2\x80\x94from that region of trust and resignation which has been in all\r\nages called divine.\r\n\r\nAt last, as the signal was given to move forward, Tito said, with a\r\nsmile\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to say, that any hose to be bestowed by the Magnificent\r\nSignoria in reward of these tidings are due, not to me, but to another\r\nman who had ridden hard to bring them, and would have been here in my\r\nplace if his horse had not broken down just before he reached Signa.\r\nMeo di Sasso will doubtless be here in an hour or two, and may all the\r\nmore justly claim the glory of the messenger, because he has had the\r\nchief labour and has lost the chief delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a graceful way of putting a necessary statement, and after a\r\nword of reply from the _Proposto_, or spokesman of the Signoria, this\r\ndignified extremity of the procession passed on, and Tito turned his\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s head to follow in its train, while the great bell of the\r\nPalazzo Vecchio was already beginning to swing, and give a louder voice\r\nto the people\xe2\x80\x99s joy in that moment, when Tito\xe2\x80\x99s attention had ceased to\r\nbe imperatively directed, it might have been expected that he would\r\nlook round and recognise Romola; but he was apparently engaged with his\r\ncap, which, now the eager people were leading his horse, he was able to\r\nseize and place on his head, while his right-hand was still encumbered\r\nby the olive-branch. He had a becoming air of lassitude after his\r\nexertions; and Romola, instead of making any effort to be recognised by\r\nhim, threw her black drapery over her head again, and remained\r\nperfectly quiet. Yet she felt almost sure that Tito had seen her; he\r\nhad the power of seeing everything without seeming to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nThe Visible Madonna.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowd had no sooner passed onward than Romola descended to the\r\nstreet, and hastened to the steps of San Stefano. Cecco had been\r\nattracted with the rest towards the Piazza, and she found Baldassarre\r\nstanding alone against the church-door, with the horn-cup in his hand,\r\nwaiting for her. There was a striking change in him: the blank, dreamy\r\nglance of a half-returned consciousness had given place to a fierceness\r\nwhich, as she advanced and spoke to him, flashed upon her as if she had\r\nbeen its object. It was the glance of caged fury that sees its prey\r\npassing safe beyond the bars.\r\n\r\nRomola started as the glance was turned on her, but her immediate\r\nthought was that he had seen Tito. And as she felt the look of hatred\r\ngrating on her, something like a hope arose that this man might be the\r\ncriminal, and that her husband might not have been guilty towards him.\r\nIf she could learn that now, by bringing Tito face to face with him,\r\nand have her mind set at rest!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will come with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can give you shelter and food\r\nuntil you are quite rested and strong. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to get my strength. I want to\r\nget my strength,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, as if he were muttering to himself,\r\nrather than speaking to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, inviting him to walk by her side, and taking the way\r\nby the Arno towards the Ponte Rubaconte as the more private road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are not a Florentine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, presently, as they turned\r\non to the bridge.\r\n\r\nHe looked round at her without speaking. His suspicious caution was\r\nmore strongly upon him than usual, just now that the fog of confusion\r\nand oblivion was made denser by bodily feebleness. But she was looking\r\nat him too, and there was something in her gentle eyes which at last\r\ncompelled him to answer her. But he answered cautiously\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am no Florentine; I am a lonely man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe observed his reluctance to speak to her, and dared not question him\r\nfurther, lest he should desire to quit her. As she glanced at him from\r\ntime to time, her mind was busy with thoughts which quenched the faint\r\nhope that there was nothing painful to be revealed about her husband.\r\nIf this old man had been in the wrong, where was the cause for dread\r\nand secrecy!\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence till they reached the entrance into the Via\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and Romola noticed that he turned and looked at her with a\r\nsudden movement as if some shock had passed through him. A few moments\r\nafter, she paused at the half-open door of the court and turned towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, not waiting for her to speak, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose wife?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola.\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible for Baldassarre to recall any name at\r\nthat moment. The very force with which the image of Tito pressed upon\r\nhim seemed to expel any verbal sign. He made no answer, but looked at\r\nher with strange fixedness.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door wide and showed the court covered with straw, on\r\nwhich lay four or five sick people, while some little children crawled\r\nor sat on it at their ease\xe2\x80\x94tiny pale creatures, biting straws and\r\ngurgling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, tremulously, \xe2\x80\x9cI will find you a\r\ncomfortable place, and bring you some more food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre. But he stood still,\r\narrested by the burden of impressions under which his mind was too\r\nconfused to choose a course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I do nothing for you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me give you some money\r\nthat you may buy food. It will be more plentiful soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had put her hand into her scarsella as she spoke, and held out her\r\npalm with several _grossi_ in it. She purposely offered him more than\r\nshe would have given to any other man in the same circumstances. He\r\nlooked at the coins a little while, and then said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will take them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe poured the coins into his palm, and he grasped them tightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, almost beseechingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Baldassarre had turned away from her, and was walking again towards\r\nthe bridge. Passing from it, straight on up the Via del Fosso, he came\r\nupon the shop of Niccol\xc3\xb2 Caparra, and turned towards it without a\r\npause, as if it had been the very object of his search. Niccol\xc3\xb2 was at\r\nthat moment in procession with the armourers of Florence, and there was\r\nonly one apprentice in the shop. But there were all sorts of weapons in\r\nabundance hanging there, and Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes discerned what he was\r\nmore hungry for than for bread. Niccol\xc3\xb2 himself would probably have\r\nrefused to sell anything that might serve as a weapon to this man with\r\nsigns of the prison on him; but the apprentice, less observant and\r\nscrupulous, took three _grossi_ for a sharp hunting-knife without any\r\nhesitation. It was a conveniently small weapon, which Baldassarre could\r\neasily thrust within the breast of his tunic, and he walked on, feeling\r\nstronger. That sharp edge might give deadliness to the thrust of an\r\naged arm: at least it was a companion, it was a power in league with\r\nhim, even if it failed. It would break against armour, but was the\r\narmour sure to be always there? In those long months while vengeance\r\nhad lain in prison, baseness had perhaps become forgetful and secure.\r\nThe knife had been bought with the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s own money. That was just.\r\nBefore he took the money, he had felt what he should do with it\xe2\x80\x94buy a\r\nweapon. Yes, and if possible, food too; food to nourish the arm that\r\nwould grasp the weapon, food to nourish the body which was the temple\r\nof vengeance. When he had had enough bread, he should be able to think\r\nand act\xe2\x80\x94to think first how he could hide himself, lest Tito should have\r\nhim dragged away again.\r\n\r\nWith that idea of hiding in his mind, Baldassarre turned up the\r\nnarrowest streets, bought himself some meat and bread, and sat down\r\nunder the first loggia to eat. The bells that swung out louder and\r\nlouder peals of joy, laying hold of him and making him vibrate along\r\nwith all the air, seemed to him simply part of that strong world which\r\nwas against him.\r\n\r\nRomola had watched Baldassarre until he had disappeared round the\r\nturning into the Piazza de\xe2\x80\x99 Mozzi, half feeling that his departure was\r\na relief, half reproaching herself for not seeking with more decision\r\nto know the truth about him, for not assuring herself whether there\r\nwere any guiltless misery in his lot which she was not helpless to\r\nrelieve. Yet what could she have done if the truth had proved to be the\r\nburden of some painful secret about her husband, in addition to the\r\nanxieties that already weighed upon her? Surely a wife was permitted to\r\ndesire ignorance of a husband\xe2\x80\x99s wrong-doing, since she alone must not\r\nprotest and warn men against him. But that thought stirred too many\r\nintricate fibres of feeling to be pursued now in her weariness. It was\r\na time to rejoice, since help had come to Florence; and she turned into\r\nthe court to tell the good news to her patients on their straw beds.\r\n\r\nShe closed the door after her, lest the bells should drown her voice,\r\nand then throwing the black drapery from her head, that the women might\r\nsee her better, she stood in the midst and told them that corn was\r\ncoming, and that the bells were ringing for gladness at the news. They\r\nall sat up to listen, while the children trotted or crawled towards\r\nher, and pulled her black skirts, as if they were impatient at being\r\nall that long way off her face. She yielded to them, weary as she was,\r\nand sat down on the straw, while the little pale things peeped into her\r\nbasket and pulled her hair down, and the feeble voices around her said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Holy Virgin be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the procession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mother of God has had pity on us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last Romola rose from the heap of straw, too tired to try and smile\r\nany longer, saying as she turned up the stone steps\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will come by-and-by, to bring you your dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, madonna! bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the faint chorus, in much the\r\nsame tone as that in which they had a few minutes before praised and\r\nthanked the unseen Madonna.\r\n\r\nRomola cared a great deal for that music. She had no innate taste for\r\ntending the sick and clothing the ragged, like some women to whom the\r\ndetails of such work are welcome in themselves, simply as an\r\noccupation. Her early training had kept her aloof from such womanly\r\nlabours; and if she had not brought to them the inspiration of her\r\ndeepest feelings, they would have been irksome to her. But they had\r\ncome to be the one unshaken resting-place of her mind, the one narrow\r\npathway on which the light fell clear. If the gulf between herself and\r\nTito which only gathered a more perceptible wideness from her attempts\r\nto bridge it by submission, brought a doubt whether, after all, the\r\nbond to which she had laboured to be true might not itself be false\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nshe came away from her confessor, Fra Salvestro, or from some contact\r\nwith the disciples of Savonarola amongst whom she worshipped, with a\r\nsickening sense that these people were miserably narrow, and with an\r\nalmost impetuous reaction towards her old contempt for their\r\nsuperstition\xe2\x80\x94she found herself recovering a firm footing in her works\r\nof womanly sympathy. Whatever else made her doubt, the help she gave to\r\nher fellow-citizens made her sure that Fra Girolamo had been right to\r\ncall her back. According to his unforgotten words, her place had not\r\nbeen empty: it had been filled with her love and her labour. Florence\r\nhad had need of her, and the more her own sorrow pressed upon her, the\r\nmore gladness she felt in the memories, stretching through the two long\r\nyears, of hours and moments in which she had lightened the burden of\r\nlife to others. All that ardour of her nature which could no longer\r\nspend itself in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness for father and husband, had\r\ntransformed itself into an enthusiasm of sympathy with the general\r\nlife. She had ceased to think that her own lot could be happy\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nceased to think of happiness at all: the one end of her life seemed to\r\nher to be the diminishing of sorrow.\r\n\r\nHer enthusiasm was continually stirred to fresh vigour by the influence\r\nof Savonarola. In spite of the wearisome visions and allegories from\r\nwhich she recoiled in disgust when they came as stale repetitions from\r\nother lips than his, her strong affinity for his passionate sympathy\r\nand the splendour of his aims had lost none of its power. His burning\r\nindignation against the abuses and oppression that made the daily story\r\nof the Church and of States had kindled the ready fire in her too. His\r\nspecial care for liberty and purity of government in Florence, with his\r\nconstant reference of this immediate object to the wider end of a\r\nuniversal regeneration, had created in her a new consciousness of the\r\ngreat drama of human existence in which her life was a part; and\r\nthrough her daily helpful contact with the less fortunate of her\r\nfellow-citizens this new consciousness became something stronger than a\r\nvague sentiment; it grew into a more and more definite motive of\r\nself-denying practice. She thought little about dogmas, and shrank from\r\nreflecting closely on the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s prophecies of the immediate scourge\r\nand closely following regeneration. She had submitted her mind to his\r\nand had entered into communion with the Church, because in this way she\r\nhad found an immediate satisfaction for moral needs which all the\r\nprevious culture and experience of her life had left hungering. Fra\r\nGirolamo\xe2\x80\x99s voice had waked in her mind a reason for living, apart from\r\npersonal enjoyment and personal affection; but it was a reason that\r\nseemed to need feeding with greater forces than she possessed within\r\nherself, and her submissive use of all offices of the Church was simply\r\na watching and waiting if by any means fresh strength might come. The\r\npressing problem for Romola just then was not to settle questions of\r\ncontroversy, but to keep alive that flame of unselfish emotion by which\r\na life of sadness might still be a life of active love.\r\n\r\nHer trust in Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s nature as greater than her own made a large\r\npart of the strength she had found. And the trust was not to be lightly\r\nshaken. It is not force of intellect which causes ready repulsion from\r\nthe aberration and eccentricities of greatness, any more than it is\r\nforce of vision that causes the eye to explore the warts on a face\r\nbright with human expression; it is simply the negation of high\r\nsensibilities. Romola was so deeply moved by the grand energies of\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s nature, that she found herself listening patiently to all\r\ndogmas and prophecies, when they came in the vehicle of his ardent\r\nfaith and believing utterance.[1]\r\n\r\nNo soul is desolate as long as there is a human being for whom it can\r\nfeel trust and reverence. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s trust in Savonarola was something\r\nlike a rope suspended securely by her path, making her step elastic\r\nwhile she grasped it; if it were suddenly removed, no firmness of the\r\nground she trod could save her from staggering, or perhaps from\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n [1] He himself had had occasion enough to note the efficacy of that\r\n vehicle. \xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d he says in the _Compendium Revelationum_, \xe2\x80\x9cyou speak of\r\n such as have not heard these things from me, I admit that they who\r\n disbelieve are more than they who believe, because it is one thing to\r\n hear him who inwardly feels these things, and another to hear him who\r\n feels them not; ... and, therefore, it is well said by Saint Jerome,\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Habet nescio quid latentis energiae vivae vocis actus, et in aures\r\n discipuli de auctoris ore transfusa fortis sonat.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nAt the Barber\xe2\x80\x99s Shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that welcome appearance as the messenger with the olive-branch,\r\nwhich was an unpromised favour of fortune, Tito had other commissions\r\nto fulfil of a more premeditated character. He paused at the Palazzo\r\nVecchio, and awaited there the return of the Ten, who managed external\r\nand war affairs, that he might duly deliver to them the results of his\r\nprivate mission to Pisa, intended as a preliminary to an avowed embassy\r\nof which Bernardo Rucellai was to be the head, with the object of\r\ncoming, if possible, to a pacific understanding with the Emperor\r\nMaximilian and the League.\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s talents for diplomatic work had been well ascertained, and as he\r\ngave with fulness and precision the results of his inquiries and\r\ninterviews, Bernardo del Nero, who was at that time one of the Ten,\r\ncould not withhold his admiration. He would have withheld it if he\r\ncould; for his original dislike of Tito had returned, and become\r\nstronger, since the sale of the library. Romola had never uttered a\r\nword to her godfather on the circumstances of the sale, and Bernardo\r\nhad understood her silence as a prohibition to him to enter on the\r\nsubject, but he felt sure that the breach of her father\xe2\x80\x99s wish had been\r\na blighting grief to her, and the old man\xe2\x80\x99s observant eyes discerned\r\nother indications that her married life was not happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, inwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat doubtless is the reason she has taken to\r\nlistening to Fra Girolamo, and going amongst the Piagnoni, which I\r\nnever expected from her. These women, if they are not happy, and have\r\nno children, must either take to folly or to some overstrained religion\r\nthat makes them think they\xe2\x80\x99ve got all heaven\xe2\x80\x99s work on their shoulders.\r\nAnd as for my poor child Romola, it is as I always said\xe2\x80\x94the cramming\r\nwith Latin and Greek has left her as much a woman as if she had done\r\nnothing all day but prick her fingers with the needle. And this husband\r\nof hers, who gets employed everywhere, because he\xe2\x80\x99s a tool with a\r\nsmooth handle, I wish Tornabuoni and the rest may not find their\r\nfingers cut. Well, well, _solco torto, sacco dritto_\xe2\x80\x94many a full sack\r\ncomes from a crooked furrow; and he who will be captain of none but\r\nhonest men will have small hire to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this long-established conviction that there could be no moral\r\nsifting of political agents, the old Florentine abstained from all\r\ninterference in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s disfavour. Apart from what must be kept sacred\r\nand private for Romola\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Bernardo had nothing direct to allege\r\nagainst the useful Greek, except that he was a Greek, and that he,\r\nBernardo, did not like him; for the doubleness of feigning attachment\r\nto the popular government, while at heart a Medicean, was common to\r\nTito with more than half the Medicean party. He only feigned with more\r\nskill than the rest: that was all. So Bernardo was simply cold to Tito,\r\nwho returned the coldness with a scrupulous, distant respect. And it\r\nwas still the notion in Florence that the old tie between Bernardo and\r\nBardo made any service done to Romola\xe2\x80\x99s husband an acceptable homage to\r\nher godfather.\r\n\r\nAfter delivering himself of his charge at the Old Palace, Tito felt\r\nthat the avowed official work of the day was done. He was tired and\r\nadust with long riding; but he did not go home. There were certain\r\nthings in his scarsella and on his mind, from which he wished to free\r\nhimself as soon as possible, but the opportunities must be found so\r\nskilfully that they must not seem to be sought. He walked from the\r\nPalazzo in a sauntering fashion towards the Piazza del Duomo. The\r\nprocession was at an end now, but the bells were still ringing, and the\r\npeople were moving about the streets restlessly, longing for some more\r\ndefinite vent to their joy. If the Frate could have stood up in the\r\ngreat Piazza and preached to them, they might have been satisfied, but\r\nnow, in spite of the new discipline which declared Christ to be the\r\nspecial King of the Florentines and required all pleasures to be of a\r\nChristian sort, there was a secret longing in many of the youngsters\r\nwho shouted \xe2\x80\x9cViva Gesu!\xe2\x80\x9d for a little vigorous stone throwing in sign\r\nof thankfulness.\r\n\r\nTito, as he passed along, could not escape being recognised by some as\r\nthe welcome bearer of the olive-branch, and could only rid himself of\r\nan inconvenient ovation, chiefly in the form of eager questions, by\r\ntelling those who pressed on him that Meo di Sasso, the true messenger\r\nfrom Leghorn, must now be entering, and might certainly be met towards\r\nthe Porta San Frediano. He could tell much more than Tito knew.\r\n\r\nFreeing himself from importunities in this adroit manner, he made his\r\nway to the Piazza del Duomo, casting his long eyes round the space with\r\nan air of the utmost carelessness, but really seeking to detect some\r\npresence which might furnish him with one of his desired opportunities.\r\nThe fact of the procession having terminated at the Duomo made it\r\nprobable that there would be more than the usual concentration of\r\nloungers and talkers in the Piazza and round Nello\xe2\x80\x99s shop. It was as he\r\nexpected. There was a group leaning against the rails near the north\r\ngates of the Baptistery, so exactly what he sought, that he looked more\r\nindifferent than ever, and seemed to recognise the tallest member of\r\nthe group entirely by chance as he had half passed him, just turning\r\nhis head to give him a slight greeting, while he tossed the end of his\r\n_becchetto_ over his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nYet the tall, broad-shouldered personage greeted in that slight way\r\nlooked like one who had considerable claims. He wore a\r\nrichly-embroidered tunic, with a great show of linen, after the newest\r\nFrench mode, and at his belt there hung a sword and poniard of fine\r\nworkmanship. His hat, with a red plume in it, seemed a scornful protest\r\nagainst the gravity of Florentine costume, which had been exaggerated\r\nto the utmost under the influence of the Piagnoni. Certain undefinable\r\nindications of youth made the breadth of his face and the large\r\ndiameter of his waist appear the more emphatically a stamp of\r\ncoarseness, and his eyes had that rude desecrating stare at all men and\r\nthings which to a refined mind is as intolerable as a bad odour or a\r\nflaring light.\r\n\r\nHe and his companions, also young men dressed expensively and wearing\r\narms, were exchanging jokes with that sort of ostentatious laughter\r\nwhich implies a desire to prove that the laughter is not mortified\r\nthough some people might suspect it. There were good reasons for such a\r\nsuspicion; for this broad-shouldered man with the red feather was Dolfo\r\nSpini, leader of the Compagnacci, or Evil Companions\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, of\r\nall the dissolute young men belonging to the old aristocratic party,\r\nenemies of the Mediceans, enemies of the popular government, but still\r\nmore bitter enemies of Savonarola. Dolfo Spini, heir of the great house\r\nwith the loggia, over the bridge of the Santa Trinita, had organised\r\nthese young men into an armed band, as sworn champions of extravagant\r\nsuppers and all the pleasant sins of the flesh, against reforming\r\npietists who threatened to make the world chaste and temperate to so\r\nintolerable a degree that there would soon be no reason for living,\r\nexcept the extreme unpleasantness of the alternative. Up to this very\r\nmorning he had been loudly declaring that Florence was given up to\r\nfamine and ruin entirely through its blind adherence to the advice of\r\nthe Frate, and that there could be no salvation for Florence but in\r\njoining the League and driving the Frate out of the city\xe2\x80\x94sending him to\r\nRome, in fact, whither he ought to have gone long ago in obedience to\r\nthe summons of the Pope. It was suspected, therefore, that Messer Dolfo\r\nSpini\xe2\x80\x99s heart was not aglow with pure joy at the unexpected succours\r\nwhich had come in apparent fulfilment of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s prediction, and\r\nthe laughter, which was ringing out afresh as Tito joined the group at\r\nNello\xe2\x80\x99s door, did not serve to dissipate the suspicion. For leaning\r\nagainst the door-post in the centre of the group was a close-shaven,\r\nkeen-eyed personage, named Niccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli, who, young as he was,\r\nhad penetrated all the small secrets of egoism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMesser Dolfo\xe2\x80\x99s head,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cis more of a pumpkin than I\r\nthought. I measure men\xe2\x80\x99s dulness by the devices they trust in for\r\ndeceiving others. Your dullest animal of all is he who grins and says\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind just after he has had his shins kicked. If I were a\r\ntrifle duller, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, smiling as the circle opened to admit\r\nTito, \xe2\x80\x9cI should pretend to be fond of this Melema, who has got a\r\nsecretaryship that would exactly suit me\xe2\x80\x94as if Latin ill-paid could\r\nlove better Latin that\xe2\x80\x99s better paid! Melema, you are a pestiferously\r\nclever fellow, very much in my way, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear you\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nanother piece of good-luck to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestionable luck, Niccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, touching him on the shoulder\r\nin a friendly way; \xe2\x80\x9cI have got nothing by it yet but being laid hold of\r\nand breathed upon by wool-beaters, when I am as soiled and battered\r\nwith riding as a _tabellario_ (letter-carrier) from Bologna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you want a touch of my art, Messer Oratore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, who had\r\ncome forward at the sound of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s voice; \xe2\x80\x9cyour chin, I perceive, has\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s crop upon it. Come, come\xe2\x80\x94consign yourself to the priest of\r\nall the Muses. Sandro, quick with the lather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, Nello, that is just what I most desire at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, seating himself; \xe2\x80\x9cand that was why I turned my steps towards thy\r\nshop, instead of going home at once, when I had done my business at the\r\nPalazzo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, it is not fitting that you should present yourself to\r\nMadonna Romola with a rusty chin and a tangled _zazzera_. Nothing that\r\nis not dainty ought to approach the Florentine lily; though I see her\r\nconstantly going about like a sunbeam amongst the rags that line our\r\ncorners\xe2\x80\x94if indeed she is not more like a moonbeam now, for I thought\r\nyesterday, when I met her, that she looked as pale and worn as that\r\nfainting Madonna of Fra Giovanni\xe2\x80\x99s. You must see to it, my bel erudito:\r\nshe keeps too many fasts and vigils in your absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito gave a melancholy shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too true, Nello. She has been\r\ndepriving herself of half her proper food _every_ day during this\r\nfamine. But what can I do? Her mind has been set all aflame. A\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s influence is powerless against the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs every other influence is likely to be, that of the Holy Father\r\nincluded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Domenico Cennini, one of the group at the door, who had\r\nturned in with Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you have gathered anything\r\nat Pisa about the way the wind sits at Rome, Melema?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecrets of the council-chamber, Messer Domenico!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, smiling\r\nand opening his palms in a deprecatory manner. \xe2\x80\x9cAn envoy must be as\r\ndumb as a father confessor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask for no breach of that\r\nrule. Well, my belief is, that if his Holiness were to drive Fra\r\nGirolamo to extremity, the Frate would move heaven and earth to get a\r\nGeneral Council of the Church\xe2\x80\x94ay, and would get it too; and I, for one,\r\nshould not be sorry, though I\xe2\x80\x99m no Piagnone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith leave of your greater experience, Messer Domenico,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMacchiavelli, \xe2\x80\x9cI must differ from you\xe2\x80\x94not in your wish to see a General\r\nCouncil which might reform the Church, but in your belief that the\r\nFrate will checkmate his Holiness. The Frate\xe2\x80\x99s game is an impossible\r\none. If he had contented himself with preaching against the vices of\r\nRome, and with prophesying that in some way, not mentioned, Italy would\r\nbe scourged, depend upon it Pope Alexander would have allowed him to\r\nspend his breath in that way as long as he could find hearers. Such\r\nspiritual blasts as those knock no walls down. But the Frate wants to\r\nbe something more than a spiritual trumpet: he wants to be a lever, and\r\nwhat is more, he _is_ a lever. He wants to spread the doctrine of\r\nChrist by maintaining a popular government in Florence, and the Pope,\r\nas I know, on the best authority, has private views to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Florence will stand by the Frate,\xe2\x80\x9d Cennini broke in, with some\r\nfervour. \xe2\x80\x9cI myself should prefer that he would let his prophesying\r\nalone, but if our freedom to choose our own government is to be\r\nattacked\xe2\x80\x94I am an obedient son of the Church, but I would vote for\r\nresisting Pope Alexander the Sixth, as our forefathers resisted Pope\r\nGregory the Eleventh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut pardon me, Messer Domenico,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, sticking his\r\nthumbs into his belt, and speaking with that cool enjoyment of\r\nexposition which surmounts every other force in discussion. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\ncorrectly seized the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s position? How is it that he has become a\r\nlever, and made himself worth attacking by an acute man like his\r\nHoliness? Because he has got the ear of the people: because he gives\r\nthem threats and promises, which they believe come straight from God,\r\nnot only about hell, purgatory, and paradise, but about Pisa and our\r\nGreat Council. But let events go against him, so as to shake the\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s faith, and the cause of his power will be the cause of his\r\nfall. He is accumulating three sorts of hatred on his head\xe2\x80\x94the hatred\r\nof average mankind against every one who wants to lay on them a strict\r\nyoke of virtue; the hatred of the stronger powers in Italy who want to\r\nfarm Florence for their own purposes; and the hatred of the people, to\r\nwhom he has ventured to promise good in this world, instead of\r\nconfining his promises to the next. If a prophet is to keep his power,\r\nhe must be a prophet like Mahomet, with an army at his back, that when\r\nthe people\xe2\x80\x99s faith is fainting it may be frightened into life again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather sum up the three sorts of hatred in one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesco Cei,\r\nimpetuously, \xe2\x80\x9cand say he has won the hatred of all men who have sense\r\nand honesty, by inventing hypocritical lies. His proper place is among\r\nthe false prophets in the Inferno, who walk with their heads turned\r\nhind-foremost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too angry, my Francesco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\npoets are apt to cut the clouds in your wrath. I am no votary of the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s, and would not lay down my little finger for his veracity. But\r\nveracity is a plant of paradise, and the seeds have never flourished\r\nbeyond the walls. You, yourself, my Francesco, tell poetical lies only;\r\npartly compelled by the poet\xe2\x80\x99s fervour, partly to please your audience;\r\nbut _you_ object to lies in prose. Well, the Frate differs from you as\r\nto the boundary of poetry, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. When he gets into the pulpit of\r\nthe Duomo, he has the fervour within him, and without him he has the\r\naudience to please. Ecco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are somewhat lax there, Niccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI myself\r\nbelieve in the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s integrity, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in his\r\nprophecies, and as long as his integrity is not disproved, we have a\r\npopular party strong enough to protect him and resist foreign\r\ninterference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA party that seems strong enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, with a shrug,\r\nand an almost imperceptible glance towards Tito, who was abandoning\r\nhimself with much enjoyment to Nello\xe2\x80\x99s combing and scenting. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how\r\nmany Mediceans are there among you? How many who will not be turned\r\nround by a private grudge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the Mediceans,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe there is very little\r\ngenuine feeling left on behalf of the Medici. Who would risk much for\r\nPiero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici? A few old staunch friends, perhaps, like Bernardo del\r\nNero; but even some of those most connected with the family are hearty\r\nfriends of the popular government, and would exert themselves for the\r\nFrate. I was talking to Giannozzo Pucci only a little while ago, and I\r\nam convinced there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he would set his face against more than\r\nagainst any attempt to alter the new order of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right there, Messer Domenico,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with a laughing\r\nmeaning in his eyes, as he rose from the shaving-chair; \xe2\x80\x9cand I fancy\r\nthe tender passion came in aid of hard theory there. I am persuaded\r\nthere was some jealousy at the bottom of Giannozzo\xe2\x80\x99s alienation from\r\nPiero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici; else so amiable a creature as he would never feel the\r\nbitterness he sometimes allows to escape him in that quarter. He was in\r\nthe procession with you, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini; \xe2\x80\x9che is at his villa\xe2\x80\x94went there three days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito was settling his cap and glancing down at his splashed hose as if\r\nhe hardly heeded the answer. In reality he had obtained a much-desired\r\npiece of information. He had at that moment in his scarsella a crushed\r\ngold ring which he had engaged to deliver to Giannozzo Pucci. He had\r\nreceived it from an envoy of Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, whom he had ridden out\r\nof his way to meet at Certaldo on the Siena road. Since Pucci was not\r\nin the town, he would send the ring by Fra Michele, a Carthusian lay\r\nBrother in the service of the Mediceans, and the receipt of that sign\r\nwould bring Pucci back to hear the verbal part of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s mission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, flourishing his comb and pointing it at Tito,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe handsomest scholar in the world or in the wolds, (\xe2\x80\x98Del mondo o di\r\nmaremma\xe2\x80\x99) now he has passed through my hands! A trifle thinner in the\r\nface, though, than when he came in his first bloom to Florence\xe2\x80\x94eh? and,\r\nI vow, there are some lines just faintly hinting themselves about your\r\nmouth, Messer Oratore! Ah, mind is an enemy to beauty! I myself was\r\nthought beautiful by the women at one time\xe2\x80\x94when I was in my\r\nswaddling-bands. But now\xe2\x80\x94oim\xc3\xa8! I carry my unwritten poems in cipher on\r\nmy face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, laughing with the rest as Nello looked at himself tragically in\r\nthe hand-mirror, made a sign of farewell to the company generally, and\r\ntook his departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m of our old Piero di Cosimo\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesco Cei. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhalf like Melema. That trick of smiling gets stronger than ever\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nwonder he has lines about the mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s too successful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, playfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething wrong about him, else he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have that secretaryship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an able man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, in a tone of judicial fairness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nand my brother have always found him useful with our Greek sheets, and\r\nhe gives great satisfaction to the Ten. I like to see a young man work\r\nhis way upward by merit. And the secretary Scala, who befriended him\r\nfrom the first, thinks highly of him still, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said a notary in the background. \xe2\x80\x9cHe writes Scala\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nofficial letters for him, or corrects them, and gets well paid for it\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Messer Bartolommeo would pay _me_ to doctor his gouty Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Macchiavelli, with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cDid _he_ tell you about the pay, Ser\r\nCeccone, or was it Melema himself?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking at the notary\r\nwith a face ironically innocent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelema? no, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ser Ceccone. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is as close as a nut.\r\nHe never brags. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s employed everywhere. They say he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting rich with doing all sorts of underhand work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ a little too bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, \xe2\x80\x9cand so many able\r\nnotaries out of employment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must say I thought that was a nasty story a year or two ago\r\nabout the man who said he had stolen jewels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cei. \xe2\x80\x9cIt got hushed\r\nup somehow; but I remember Piero di Cosimo said, at the time, he\r\nbelieved there was something in it, for he saw Melema\xe2\x80\x99s face when the\r\nman laid hold of him, and he never saw a visage so \xe2\x80\x98painted with fear,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas our sour old Dante says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, spit no more of that venom, Francesco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nello, getting\r\nindignant, \xe2\x80\x9celse I shall consider it a public duty to cut your hair\r\nawry the next time I get you under my scissors. That story of the\r\nstolen jewels was a lie. Bernardo Rucellai and the Magnificent Eight\r\nknew all about it. The man was a dangerous madman, and he was very\r\nproperly kept out of mischief in prison. As for our Piero di Cosimo,\r\nhis wits are running after the wind of Mongibello: he has such an\r\nextravagant fancy that he would take a lizard for a crocodile. No: that\r\nstory has been dead and buried too long\xe2\x80\x94our noses object to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget the danger of the\r\nprecedent, Francesco. The next mad beggarman may accuse you of stealing\r\nhis verses, or me, God help me! of stealing his coppers. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non, turning towards the door, \xe2\x80\x9cDolfo Spini has carried his red feather\r\nout of the Piazza. That captain of swaggerers would like the Republic\r\nto lose Pisa just for the chance of seeing the people tear the frock\r\noff the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s back. With your pardon, Francesco\xe2\x80\x94I know he is a friend\r\nof yours\xe2\x80\x94there are few things I should like better than to see him play\r\nthe part of Capo d\xe2\x80\x99Oca, who went out to the tournament blowing his\r\ntrumpets and returned with them in a bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nBy a Street Lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, when it was dark and threatening rain, Romola, returning\r\nwith Maso and the lantern by her side, from the hospital of San Matteo,\r\nwhich she had visited after vespers, encountered her husband just\r\nissuing from the monastery of San Marco. Tito, who had gone out again\r\nshortly after his arrival in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and had seen little of\r\nRomola during the day, immediately proposed to accompany her home,\r\ndismissing Maso, whose short steps annoyed him. It was only usual for\r\nhim to pay her such an official attention when it was obviously\r\ndemanded from him. Tito and Romola never jarred, never remonstrated\r\nwith each other. They were too hopelessly alienated in their inner life\r\never to have that contest which is an effort towards agreement. They\r\ntalked of all affairs, public and private, with careful adherence to an\r\nadopted course. If Tito wanted a supper prepared in the old library,\r\nnow pleasantly furnished as a banqueting-room, Romola assented, and saw\r\nthat everything needful was done: and Tito, on his side, left her\r\nentirely uncontrolled in her daily habits, accepting the help she\r\noffered him in transcribing or making digests, and in return meeting\r\nher conjectured want of supplies for her charities. Yet he constantly,\r\nas on this very morning, avoided exchanging glances with her; affected\r\nto believe that she was out of the house, in order to avoid seeking her\r\nin her own room; and playfully attributed to her a perpetual preference\r\nof solitude to his society.\r\n\r\nIn the first ardour of her self-conquest, after she had renounced her\r\nresolution of flight, Romola had made many timid efforts towards the\r\nreturn of a frank relation between them. But to her such a relation\r\ncould only come by open speech about their differences, and the attempt\r\nto arrive at a moral understanding; while Tito could only be saved from\r\nalienation from her by such a recovery of her effusive tenderness as\r\nwould have presupposed oblivion of their differences. He cared for no\r\nexplanation between them; he felt any thorough explanation impossible:\r\nhe would have cared to have Romola fond again, and to her, fondness was\r\nimpossible. She could be submissive and gentle, she could repress any\r\nsign of repulsion; but tenderness was not to be feigned. She was\r\nhelplessly conscious of the result: her husband was alienated from her.\r\n\r\nIt was an additional reason why she should be carefully kept outside of\r\nsecrets which he would in no case have chosen to communicate to her.\r\nWith regard to his political action he sought to convince her that he\r\nconsidered the cause of the Medici hopeless; and that on that practical\r\nground, as well as in theory, he heartily served the popular\r\ngovernment, in which she had now a warm interest. But impressions\r\nsubtle as odours made her uneasy about his relations with San Marco.\r\nShe was painfully divided between the dread of seeing any evidence to\r\narouse her suspicions, and the impulse to watch lest any harm should\r\ncome that she might have arrested.\r\n\r\nAs they walked together this evening, Tito said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe business of the\r\nday is not yet quite ended for me. I shall conduct you to our door, my\r\nRomola, and then I must fulfil another commission, which will take me\r\nan hour, perhaps, before I can return and rest, as I very much need to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he talked amusingly of what he had seen at Pisa, until they\r\nwere close upon a loggia, near which there hung a lamp before a picture\r\nof the Virgin. The street was a quiet one, and hitherto they had passed\r\nfew people; but now there was a sound of many approaching footsteps and\r\nconfused voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not get home without a wetting, unless we take shelter under\r\nthis convenient loggia,\xe2\x80\x9d Tito said, hastily, hurrying Romola, with a\r\nslightly startled movement, up the step of the loggia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely it is useless to wait for this small drizzling rain,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRomola, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: I felt it becoming heavier. Let us wait a little.\xe2\x80\x9d With that\r\nwakefulness to the faintest indication which belongs to a mind\r\nhabitually in a state of caution, Tito had detected by the glimmer of\r\nthe lamp that the leader of the advancing group wore a red feather and\r\na glittering sword-hilt\xe2\x80\x94in fact, was almost the last person in the\r\nworld he would have chosen to meet at this hour with Romola by his\r\nside. He had already during the day had one momentous interview with\r\nDolfo Spini, and the business he had spoken of to Romola as yet to be\r\ndone was a second interview with that personage, a sequence of the\r\nvisit he had paid at San Marco. Tito, by a long-preconcerted plan, had\r\nbeen the bearer of letters to Savonarola\xe2\x80\x94carefully-forged letters; one\r\nof them, by a stratagem, bearing the very signature and seal of the\r\nCardinal of Naples, who of all the Sacred College had most exerted his\r\ninfluence at Rome in favour of the Frate. The purport of the letters\r\nwas to state that the Cardinal was on his progress from Pisa, and,\r\nunwilling for strong reasons to enter Florence, yet desirous of taking\r\ncounsel with Savonarola at this difficult juncture, intended to pause\r\nthis very day at San Casciano, about ten miles from the city, whence he\r\nwould ride out the next morning in the plain garb of a priest, and meet\r\nSavonarola, as if casually, five miles on the Florence road, two hours\r\nafter sunrise. The plot, of which these forged letters were the initial\r\nstep, was that Dolfo Spini with a band of his Compagnacci was to be\r\nposted in ambush on the road, at a lonely spot about five miles from\r\nthe gates; that he was to seize Savonarola with the Dominican brother\r\nwho would accompany him according to rule, and deliver him over to a\r\nsmall detachment of Milanese horse in readiness near San Casciano, by\r\nwhom he was to be carried into the Roman territory.\r\n\r\nThere was a strong chance that the penetrating Frate would suspect a\r\ntrap, and decline to incur the risk, which he had for some time\r\navoided, of going beyond the city walls. Even when he preached, his\r\nfriends held it necessary that he should be attended by an armed guard;\r\nand here he was called on to commit himself to a solitary road, with no\r\nother attendant than a fellow-monk. On this ground the minimum of time\r\nhad been given him for decision, and the chance in favour of his acting\r\non the letters was, that the eagerness with which his mind was set on\r\nthe combining of interests within and without the Church towards the\r\nprocuring of a General Council, and also the expectation of immediate\r\nservice from the Cardinal in the actual juncture of his contest with\r\nthe Pope, would triumph over his shrewdness and caution in the brief\r\nspace allowed for deliberation.\r\n\r\nTito had had an audience of Savonarola, having declined to put the\r\nletters into any hands but his, and with consummate art had admitted\r\nthat incidentally, and by inference, he was able so far to conjecture\r\ntheir purport as to believe they referred to a rendezvous outside the\r\ngates, in which case he urged that the Frate should seek an armed guard\r\nfrom the Signoria, and offered his services in carrying the request\r\nwith the utmost privacy. Savonarola had replied briefly that this was\r\nimpossible: an armed guard was incompatible with privacy. He spoke with\r\na flashing eye, and Tito felt convinced that he meant to incur the\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nTito himself did not much care for the result. He managed his affairs\r\nso cleverly, that all results, he considered, must turn to his\r\nadvantage. Whichever party came uppermost, he was secure of favour and\r\nmoney. That is an indecorously naked statement; the fact, clothed as\r\nTito habitually clothed it, was that his acute mind, discerning the\r\nequal hollowness of all parties, took the only rational course in\r\nmaking them subservient to his own interest.\r\n\r\nIf Savonarola fell into the snare, there were diamonds in question and\r\npapal patronage; if not, Tito\xe2\x80\x99s adroit agency had strengthened his\r\nposition with Savonarola and with Spini, while any confidences he\r\nobtained from them made him the more valuable as an agent of the\r\nMediceans.\r\n\r\nBut Spini was an inconvenient colleague. He had cunning enough to\r\ndelight in plots, but not the ability or self-command necessary to so\r\ncomplex an effect as secrecy. He frequently got excited with drinking,\r\nfor even sober Florence had its \xe2\x80\x9cBeoni,\xe2\x80\x9d or topers, both lay and\r\nclerical, who became loud at taverns and private banquets; and in spite\r\nof the agreement between him and Tito, that their public recognition of\r\neach other should invariably be of the coolest sort, there was always\r\nthe possibility that on an evening encounter he would be suddenly\r\nblurting and affectionate. The delicate sign of casting the becchetto\r\nover the left shoulder was understood in the morning, but the strongest\r\nhint short of a threat might not suffice to keep off a fraternal grasp\r\nof the shoulder in the evening.\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s chief hope now was that Dolfo Spini had not caught sight of him,\r\nand the hope would have been well founded if Spini had had no clearer\r\nview of him than he had caught of Spini. But, himself in shadow, he had\r\nseen Tito illuminated for an instant by the direct rays of the lamp,\r\nand Tito in his way was as strongly marked a personage as the captain\r\nof the Compagnacci. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s black-shrouded figure had escaped notice,\r\nand she now stood behind her husband\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder in the corner of the\r\nloggia. Tito was not left to hope long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! my carrier-pigeon!\xe2\x80\x9d grated Spini\xe2\x80\x99s harsh voice, in what he meant\r\nto be an undertone, while his hand grasped Tito\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did\r\nyou run into hiding for? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was comrades who were\r\ncoming. It\xe2\x80\x99s well I caught sight of you; it saves time. What of the\r\nchase to-morrow morning? Will the bald-headed game rise? Are the\r\nfalcons to be got ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf it had been in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s nature to feel an access of rage, he would\r\nhave felt it against this bull-faced accomplice, unfit either for a\r\nleader or a tool. His lips turned white, but his excitement came from\r\nthe pressing difficulty of choosing a safe device. If he attempted to\r\nhush Spini, that would only deepen Romola\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion, and he knew her\r\nwell enough to know that if some strong alarm were roused in her, she\r\nwas neither to be silenced nor hoodwinked: on the other hand, if he\r\nrepelled Spini angrily the wine-breathing Compagnaccio might become\r\nsavage, being more ready at resentment than at the divination of\r\nmotives. He adopted a third course, which proved that Romola retained\r\none sort of power over him\xe2\x80\x94the power of dread.\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand, as if intending a hint to her, and said in a\r\ngood-humoured tone of comradeship\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my Dolfo, you may prepare in all security. But take no trumpets\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini, a little piqued. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to play Ser\r\nSaccente with me. I know where the devil keeps his tail as well as you\r\ndo. What! he swallowed the bait whole? The prophetic nose didn\xe2\x80\x99t scent\r\nthe hook at all?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, lowering his tone a little, with a\r\nblundering sense of secrecy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brute will not be satisfied till he has emptied the bag,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nTito: but aloud he said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSwallowed all as easily as you swallow a cup\r\nof Trebbiano. Ha! I see torches: there must be a dead body coming. The\r\npestilence has been spreading, I hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSantiddio! I hate the sight of those biers. Good-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini,\r\nhastily moving off.\r\n\r\nThe torches were really coming, but they preceded a church dignitary\r\nwho was returning homeward; the suggestion of the dead body and the\r\npestilence was Tito\xe2\x80\x99s device for getting rid of Spini without telling\r\nhim to go. The moment he had moved away, Tito turned to Romola, and\r\nsaid, quietly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be alarmed by anything that _bestia_ has said, my Romola. We\r\nwill go on now: I think the rain has not increased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was quivering with indignant resolution; it was of no use for Tito\r\nto speak in that unconcerned way. She distrusted every word he could\r\nutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not go on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not move nearer home until I have\r\nsome security against this treachery being perpetrated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, at least, until these torches have passed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with\r\nperfect self-command, but with a new rising of dislike to a wife who\r\nthis time, he foresaw, might have the power of thwarting him in spite\r\nof the husband\xe2\x80\x99s predominance.\r\n\r\nThe torches passed, with the Vicario dell\xe2\x80\x99 Arcivescovo, and due\r\nreverence was done by Tito, but Romola saw nothing outward. If for the\r\ndefeat of this treachery, in which she believed with all the force of\r\nlong presentiment, it had been necessary at that moment for her to\r\nspring on her husband and hurl herself with him down a precipice, she\r\nfelt as if she could have done it. Union with this man! At that moment\r\nthe self-quelling discipline of two years seemed to be nullified: she\r\nfelt nothing but that they were divided.\r\n\r\nThey were nearly in darkness again, and could only see each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaces dimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the truth, Tito\xe2\x80\x94this time tell me the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in\r\na low quivering voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be safer for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I desire to tell you anything else, my angry saint?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, with a slight touch of contempt, which was the vent of his\r\nannoyance; \xe2\x80\x9csince the truth is precisely that over which you have most\r\nreason to rejoice\xe2\x80\x94namely, that my knowing a plot of Spini\xe2\x80\x99s enables me\r\nto secure the Frate from falling a victim to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the plot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I decline to tell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough that the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsafety will be secured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a plot for drawing him outside the gates that Spini may murder\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been no intention of murder. It is simply a plot for\r\ncompelling him to obey the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s summons to Rome. But as I serve the\r\npopular government, and think the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s presence here is a necessary\r\nmeans of maintaining it at present, I choose to prevent his departure.\r\nYou may go to sleep with entire ease of mind to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Romola was silent. Then she said, in a voice of anguish,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, it is of no use: I have no belief in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could just discern his action as he shrugged his shoulders, and\r\nspread out his palms in silence. That cold dislike which is the anger\r\nof unimpassioned beings was hardening within him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Frate leaves the city\xe2\x80\x94if any harm happens to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nafter a slight pause, in a new tone of indignant resolution,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\ndeclare what I have heard to the Signoria, and you will be disgraced.\r\nWhat if I am your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, impetuously; \xe2\x80\x9cI will be disgraced\r\nwith you. If we are united, I am that part of you that will save you\r\nfrom crime. Others shall not be betrayed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite aware of what you would be likely to do, _anima mia_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, in the coolest of his liquid tones; \xe2\x80\x9ctherefore if you have a\r\nsmall amount of reasoning at your disposal just now, consider that if\r\nyou believe me in nothing else, you may believe me when I say I will\r\ntake care of myself, and not put it in your power to ruin me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you assure me that the Frate is warned\xe2\x80\x94he will not go beyond the\r\ngates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall not go beyond the gates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, but distrust was not to be expelled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go back to San Marco now and find out,\xe2\x80\x9d Romola said, making a\r\nmovement forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, in a bitter whisper, seizing her wrists\r\nwith all his masculine force. \xe2\x80\x9cI am master of you. You shall not set\r\nyourself in opposition to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were passers-by approaching. Tito had heard them, and that was\r\nwhy he spoke in a whisper. Romola was too conscious of being mastered\r\nto have struggled, even if she had remained unconscious that witnesses\r\nwere at hand. But she was aware now of footsteps and voices, and her\r\nhabitual sense of personal dignity made her at once yield to Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovement towards leading her from the loggia.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence for some time, under the small drizzling\r\nrain. The first rush of indignation and alarm in Romola had begun to\r\ngive way to more complicated feelings, which rendered speech and action\r\ndifficult. In that simpler state of vehemence, open opposition to the\r\nhusband from whom she felt her soul revolting had had the aspect of\r\ntemptation for her; it seemed the easiest of all courses. But now,\r\nhabits of self-questioning, memories of impulse subdued, and that proud\r\nreserve which all discipline had left unmodified, began to emerge from\r\nthe flood of passion. The grasp of her wrists, which asserted her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s physical predominance, instead of arousing a new fierceness\r\nin her, as it might have done if her impetuosity had been of a more\r\nvulgar kind, had given her a momentary shuddering horror at this form\r\nof contest with him. It was the first time they had been in declared\r\nhostility to each other since her flight and return, and the check\r\ngiven to her ardent resolution then, retained the power to arrest her\r\nnow. In this altered condition her mind began to dwell on the\r\nprobabilities that would save her from any desperate course: Tito would\r\nnot risk betrayal by her; whatever had been his original intention, he\r\nmust be determined now by the fact that she knew of the plot. She was\r\nnot bound now to do anything else than to hang over him that certainty,\r\nthat if he deceived her, her lips would not be closed. And then, it was\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94yes, she must cling to that possibility till it was\r\ndisproved\xe2\x80\x94that Tito had never meant to aid in the betrayal of the\r\nFrate.\r\n\r\nTito, on his side, was busy with thoughts, and did not speak again till\r\nthey were near home. Then he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Romola, have you now had time to recover calmness? If so, you\r\ncan supply your want of belief in me by a little rational inference:\r\nyou can see, I presume, that if I had had any intention of furthering\r\nSpini\xe2\x80\x99s plot, I should now be aware that the possession of a fair\r\nPiagnone for my wife, who knows the secret of the plot, would be a\r\nserious obstacle in my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito assumed the tone which was just then the easiest to him,\r\nconjecturing that in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s present mood persuasive deprecation would\r\nbe lost upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you believe that I\r\nwould guard the Republic from further treachery. You are right to\r\nbelieve it: if the Frate is betrayed, I will denounce you.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused\r\na moment, and then said, with an effort, \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was not so. I have\r\nperhaps spoken too hastily\xe2\x80\x94you never meant it. Only, why will you seem\r\nto be that man\xe2\x80\x99s comrade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch relations are inevitable to practical men, my Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito,\r\ngratified by discerning the struggle within her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou fair creatures\r\nlive in the clouds. Pray go to rest with an easy heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nopening the door for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nCheck.\r\n\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s clever arrangements had been unpleasantly frustrated by trivial\r\nincidents which could not enter into a clever man\xe2\x80\x99s calculations. It\r\nwas very seldom that he walked with Romola in the evening, yet he had\r\nhappened to be walking with her precisely on this evening when her\r\npresence was supremely inconvenient. Life was so complicated a game\r\nthat the devices of skill were liable to be defeated at every turn by\r\nair-blown chances, incalculable as the descent of thistle-down.\r\n\r\nIt was not that he minded about the failure of Spini\xe2\x80\x99s plot, but he\r\nfelt an awkward difficulty in so adjusting his warning to Savonarola on\r\nthe one hand, and to Spini on the other, as not to incur suspicion.\r\nSuspicion roused in the popular party might be fatal to his reputation\r\nand ostensible position in Florence: suspicion roused in Dolfo Spini\r\nmight be as disagreeable in its effects as the hatred of a fierce dog\r\nnot to be chained.\r\n\r\nIf Tito went forthwith to the monastery to warn Savonarola before the\r\nmonks went to rest, his warning would follow so closely on his delivery\r\nof the forged letters that he could not escape unfavourable surmises.\r\nHe could not warn Spini at once without telling him the true reason,\r\nsince he could not immediately allege the discovery that Savonarola had\r\nchanged his purpose; and he knew Spini well enough to know that his\r\nunderstanding would discern nothing but that Tito had \xe2\x80\x9cturned round\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand frustrated the plot. On the other hand, by deferring his warning to\r\nSavonarola until the morning, he would be almost sure to lose the\r\nopportunity of warning Spini that the Frate had changed his mind; and\r\nthe band of Compagnacci would come back in all the rage of\r\ndisappointment. This last, however, was the risk he chose, trusting to\r\nhis power of soothing Spini by assuring him that the failure was due\r\nonly to the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s caution.\r\n\r\nTito was annoyed. If he had had to smile it would have been an unusual\r\neffort to him. He was determined not to encounter Romola again, and he\r\ndid not go home that night.\r\n\r\nShe watched through the night, and never took off her clothes. She\r\nheard the rain become heavier and heavier. She liked to hear the rain:\r\nthe stormy heavens seemed a safeguard against men\xe2\x80\x99s devices, compelling\r\nthem to inaction. And Romola\xe2\x80\x99s mind was again assailed, not only by the\r\nutmost doubt of her husband, but by doubt as to her own conduct. What\r\nlie might he not have told her? What project might he not have, of\r\nwhich she was still ignorant? Every one who trusted Tito was in danger;\r\nit was useless to try and persuade herself of the contrary. And was not\r\nshe selfishly listening to the promptings of her own pride, when she\r\nshrank from warning men against him? \xe2\x80\x9cIf her husband was a malefactor,\r\nher place was in the prison by his side\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that might be; she was\r\ncontented to fulfil that claim. But was she, a wife, to allow a husband\r\nto inflict the injuries that would make him a malefactor, when it might\r\nbe in her power to prevent them? Prayer seemed impossible to her. The\r\nactivity of her thought excluded a mental state of which the essence is\r\nexpectant passivity.\r\n\r\nThe excitement became stronger and stronger. Her imagination, in a\r\nstate of morbid activity, conjured up possible schemes by which, after\r\nall, Tito would have eluded her threat; and towards daybreak the rain\r\nbecame less violent, till at last it ceased, the breeze rose again and\r\ndispersed the clouds, and the morning fell clear on all the objects\r\naround her. It made her uneasiness all the less endurable. She wrapped\r\nher mantle round her, and ran up to the loggia, as if there could be\r\nanything in the wide landscape that might determine her action; as if\r\nthere could be anything but roofs hiding the line of street along which\r\nSavonarola might be walking towards betrayal.\r\n\r\nIf she went to her godfather, might she not induce him, without any\r\nspecific revelation, to take measures for preventing Fra Girolamo from\r\npassing the gates? But that might be too late. Romola thought, with new\r\ndistress, that she had failed to learn any guiding details from Tito,\r\nand it was already long past seven. She must go to San Marco: there was\r\nnothing else to be done.\r\n\r\nShe hurried down the stairs, she went out into the street without\r\nlooking at her sick people, and walked at a swift pace along the Via\r\nde\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi towards the Ponte Vecchio. She would go through the heart of\r\nthe city; it was the most direct road, and, besides, in the great\r\nPiazza there was a chance of encountering her husband, who, by some\r\npossibility to which she still clung, might satisfy her of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsafety, and leave no need for her to go to San Marco. When she arrived\r\nin front of the Palazzo Vecchio, she looked eagerly into the pillared\r\ncourt; then her eyes swept the Piazza; but the well-known figure, once\r\npainted in her heart by young love, and now branded there by eating\r\npain, was nowhere to be seen. She hurried straight on to the Piazza del\r\nDuomo. It was already full of movement: there were worshippers passing\r\nup and down the marble steps, there were men pausing for chat, and\r\nthere were market-people carrying their burdens. Between those moving\r\nfigures Romola caught a glimpse of her husband. On his way from San\r\nMarco he had turned into Nello\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and was now leaning against the\r\ndoor-post. As Romola approached she could see that he was standing and\r\ntalking, with the easiest air in the world, holding his cap in his\r\nhand, and shaking back his freshly-combed hair. The contrast of this\r\nease with the bitter anxieties he had created convulsed her with\r\nindignation: the new vision of his hardness heightened her dread. She\r\nrecognised Cronaca and two other frequenters of San Marco standing near\r\nher husband. It flashed through her mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI will compel him to speak\r\nbefore those men.\xe2\x80\x9d And her light step brought her close upon him before\r\nhe had time to move, while Cronaca was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere comes Madonna\r\nRomola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight shock passed through Tito\xe2\x80\x99s frame as he felt himself face to\r\nface with his wife. She was haggard with her anxious watching, but\r\nthere was a flash of something else than anxiety in her eyes as she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Frate gone beyond the gates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, feeling completely helpless before this woman, and\r\nneeding all the self-command he possessed to preserve a countenance in\r\nwhich there should seem to be nothing stronger than surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are certain that he is not going?\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain that he is not going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, and she turned up the steps, to take\r\nrefuge in the Duomo, till she could recover from her agitation.\r\n\r\nTito never had a feeling so near hatred as that with which his eyes\r\nfollowed Romola retreating up the steps.\r\n\r\nThere were present not only genuine followers of the Frate, but Ser\r\nCeccone, the notary, who at that time, like Tito himself, was secretly\r\nan agent of the Mediceans.\r\n\r\nSer Francesco di Ser Barone, more briefly known to infamy as Ser\r\nCeccone, was not learned, not handsome, not successful, and the reverse\r\nof generous. He was a traitor without charm. It followed that he was\r\nnot fond of Tito Melema.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nCounter-Check.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when Tito returned home. Romola, seated\r\nopposite the cabinet in her narrow room, copying documents, was about\r\nto desist from her work because the light was getting dim, when her\r\nhusband entered. He had come straight to this room to seek her, with a\r\nthoroughly defined intention, and there was something new to Romola in\r\nhis manner and expression as he looked at her silently on entering,\r\nand, without taking off his cap and mantle, leaned one elbow on the\r\ncabinet, and stood directly in front of her.\r\n\r\nRomola, fully assured during the day of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s safety, was feeling\r\nthe reaction of some penitence for the access of distrust and\r\nindignation which had impelled her to address her husband publicly on a\r\nmatter that she knew he wished to be private. She told herself that she\r\nhad probably been wrong. The scheming duplicity which she had heard\r\neven her godfather allude to as inseparable from party tactics might be\r\nsufficient to account for the connection with Spini, without the\r\nsupposition that Tito had ever meant to further the plot. She wanted to\r\natone for her impetuosity by confessing that she had been too hasty,\r\nand for some hours her mind had been dwelling on the possibility that\r\nthis confession of hers might lead to other frank words breaking the\r\ntwo years\xe2\x80\x99 silence of their hearts. The silence had been so complete,\r\nthat Tito was ignorant of her having fled from him and come back again;\r\nthey had never approached an avowal of that past which, both in its\r\nyoung love and in the shock that shattered the love, lay locked away\r\nfrom them like a banquet-room where death had once broken the feast.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with that submission in her glance which belonged\r\nto her state of self-reproof; but the subtle change in his face and\r\nmanner arrested her speech. For a few moments they remained silent,\r\nlooking at each other.\r\n\r\nTito himself felt that a crisis was come in his married life. The\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s determination to mastery, which lay deep below all blandness\r\nand beseechingness, had risen permanently to the surface now, and\r\nseemed to alter his face, as a face is altered by a hidden muscular\r\ntension with which a man is secretly throttling or stamping out the\r\nlife from something feeble, yet dangerous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in the cool liquid tone that made her shiver, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis time that we should understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I most desire, Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. Her sweet pale\r\nface; with all its anger gone and nothing but the timidity of\r\nself-doubt in it, seemed to give a marked predominance to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndark strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou took a step this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Tito went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich you must now\r\nyourself perceive to have been useless\xe2\x80\x94which exposed you to remark and\r\nmay involve me in serious practical difficulties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI acknowledge that I was too hasty; I am sorry for any injustice I may\r\nhave done you.\xe2\x80\x9d Romola spoke these words in a fuller and firmer tone;\r\nTito, she hoped, would look less hard when she had expressed her\r\nregret, and then she could say other things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you once for all to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without any change of\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat such collisions are incompatible with our position as\r\nhusband and wife. I wish you to reflect on the mode in which you were\r\nled to that step, that the process may not be repeated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends chiefly on you, Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, taking fire slightly.\r\nIt was not at all what she had thought of saying, but we see a very\r\nlittle way before us in mutual speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would say, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cthat nothing is to occur in\r\nfuture which can excite your unreasonable suspicions. You were frank\r\nenough to say last night that you have no belief in me. I am not\r\nsurprised at any exaggerated conclusion you may draw from slight\r\npremises, but I wish to point out to you what is likely to be the fruit\r\nof your making such exaggerated conclusions a ground for interfering in\r\naffairs of which you are ignorant. Your attention is thoroughly awake\r\nto what I am saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused for a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, flushing in irrepressible resentment at this cold\r\ntone of superiority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it may possibly not be very long before some other chance\r\nwords or incidents set your imagination at work devising crimes for me,\r\nand you may perhaps rush to the Palazzo Vecchio to alarm the Signoria\r\nand set the city in an uproar. Shall I tell you what may be the result?\r\nNot simply the disgrace of your husband, to which you look forward with\r\nso much courage, but the arrest and ruin of many among the chief men in\r\nFlorence, including Messer Bernardo del Nero.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito had meditated a decisive move, and he had made it. The flush died\r\nout of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face, and her very lips were pale\xe2\x80\x94an unusual effect\r\nwith her, for she was little subject to fear. Tito perceived his\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would perhaps flatter yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were\r\nperforming a heroic deed of deliverance; you might as well try to turn\r\nlocks with fine words as apply such notions to the politics of\r\nFlorence. The question now is, not whether you can have any belief in\r\nme, but whether, now you have been warned, you will dare to rush, like\r\na blind man with a torch in his hand, amongst intricate affairs of\r\nwhich you know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola felt as if her mind were held in a vice by Tito\xe2\x80\x99s: the\r\npossibilities he had indicated were rising before her with terrible\r\nclearness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too rash,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will try not to be rash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with unsparing insistence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your act of\r\ndistrust towards me this morning might, for aught you knew, have had\r\nmore fatal effects than that sacrifice of your husband which you have\r\nlearned to contemplate without flinching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, it is not so,\xe2\x80\x9d Romola burst forth in a pleading tone, rising and\r\ngoing nearer to him, with a desperate resolution to speak out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nfalse that I would willingly sacrifice you. It has been the greatest\r\neffort of my life to cling to you. I went away in my anger two years\r\nago, and I came back again because I was more bound to you than to\r\nanything else on earth. But it is useless. You shut me out from your\r\nmind. You affect to think of me as a being too unreasonable to share in\r\nthe knowledge of your affairs. You will be open with me about nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked like his good angel pleading with him, as she bent her face\r\ntowards him with dilated eyes, and laid her hand upon his arm. But\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s touch and glance no longer stirred any fibre of tenderness in\r\nher husband. The good-humoured, tolerant Tito, incapable of hatred,\r\nincapable almost of impatience, disposed always to be gentle towards\r\nthe rest of the world, felt himself becoming strangely hard towards\r\nthis wife whose presence had once been the strongest influence he had\r\nknown. With all his softness of disposition, he had a masculine\r\neffectiveness of intellect and purpose which, like sharpness of edge,\r\nis itself an energy, working its way without any strong momentum.\r\nRomola had an energy of her own which thwarted his, and no man, who is\r\nnot exceptionally feeble, will endure being thwarted by his wife.\r\nMarriage must be a relation either of sympathy or of conquest.\r\n\r\nNo emotion darted across his face as he heard Romola for the first time\r\nspeak of having gone away from him. His lips only looked a little\r\nharder as he smiled slightly and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Romola, when certain conditions are ascertained, we must make up\r\nour minds to them. No amount of wishing will fill the Arno, as your\r\npeople say, or turn a plum into an orange. I have not observed even\r\nthat prayers have much efficacy that way. You are so constituted as to\r\nhave certain strong impressions inaccessible to reason: I cannot share\r\nthose impressions, and you have withdrawn all trust from me in\r\nconsequence. You have changed towards me; it has followed that I have\r\nchanged towards you. It is useless to take any retrospect. We have\r\nsimply to adapt ourselves to altered conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTito, it would not be useless for us to speak openly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nwith the sort of exasperation that comes from using living muscle\r\nagainst some lifeless insurmountable resistance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the sense of\r\ndeception in you that changed me, and that has kept us apart. And it is\r\nnot true that I changed first. You changed towards me the night you\r\nfirst wore that chain-armour. You had some secret from me\xe2\x80\x94it was about\r\nthat old man\xe2\x80\x94and I saw him again yesterday. Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, in a\r\ntone of agonised entreaty, \xe2\x80\x9cif you would once tell me everything, let\r\nit be what it may\xe2\x80\x94I would not mind pain\xe2\x80\x94that there might be no wall\r\nbetween us! Is it not possible that we could begin a new life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time there was a flash of emotion across Tito\xe2\x80\x99s face. He stood\r\nperfectly still; but the flash seemed to have whitened him. He took no\r\nnotice of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, but after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, said quietly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour impetuosity about trifles, Romola, has a freezing influence that\r\nwould cool the baths of Nero.\xe2\x80\x9d At these cutting words, Romola shrank\r\nand drew herself up into her usual self-sustained attitude. Tito went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cIf by \xe2\x80\x98that old man\xe2\x80\x99 you mean the mad Jacopo di Nola who attempted\r\nmy life and made a strange accusation against me, of which I told you\r\nnothing because it would have alarmed you to no purpose, he, poor\r\nwretch, has died in prison. I saw his name in the list of dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about his accusation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know he is\r\nthe man whom I saw with the rope round his neck in the Duomo\xe2\x80\x94the man\r\nwhose portrait Piero di Cosimo painted, grasping your arm as he saw him\r\ngrasp it the day the French entered, the day you first wore the\r\narmour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is he now, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, still pale, but governing\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was lying lifeless in the street from starvation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrevived him with bread and wine. I brought him to our door, but he\r\nrefused to come in. Then I gave him some money, and he went away\r\nwithout telling me anything. But he had found out that I was your wife.\r\nWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man, half mad, half imbecile, who was once my father\xe2\x80\x99s servant in\r\nGreece, and who has a rancorous hatred towards me because I got him\r\ndismissed for theft. Now you have the whole mystery, and the further\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that I am again in danger of assassination. The\r\nfact of my wearing the armour, about which you seem to have thought so\r\nmuch, must have led you to infer that I was in danger from this man.\r\nWas that the reason you chose to cultivate his acquaintance and invite\r\nhim into the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola was mute. To speak was only like rushing with bare breast\r\nagainst a shield.\r\n\r\nTito moved from his leaning posture, slowly took off his cap and\r\nmantle, and pushed back his hair. He was collecting himself for some\r\nfinal words. And Romola stood upright looking at him as she might have\r\nlooked at some on-coming deadly force, to be met only by silent\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need not refer to these matters again, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, precisely\r\nin the same tone as that in which he had spoken at first. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough\r\nif you will remember that the next time your generous ardour leads you\r\nto interfere in political affairs, you are likely, not to save any one\r\nfrom danger, but to be raising scaffolds and setting houses on fire.\r\nYou are not yet a sufficiently ardent Piagnone to believe that Messer\r\nBernardo del Nero is the prince of darkness, and Messer Francesco\r\nValori the archangel Michael. I think I need demand no promise from\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have understood you too well, Tito.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, leaving the room.\r\n\r\nRomola turned round with despair in her face and sank into her seat. \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nGod, I have tried\xe2\x80\x94I cannot help it. We shall always be divided.\xe2\x80\x9d Those\r\nwords passed silently through her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless,\xe2\x80\x9d she said aloud, as if\r\nsome sudden vision had startled her into speech\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunless misery should\r\ncome and join us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, too, had a new thought in his mind after he had closed the door\r\nbehind him. With the project of leaving Florence as soon as his life\r\nthere had become a high enough stepping-stone to a life elsewhere,\r\nperhaps at Rome or Milan, there was now for the first time associated a\r\ndesire to be free from Romola, and to leave her behind him. She had\r\nceased to belong to the desirable furniture of his life: there was no\r\npossibility of an easy relation between them without genuineness on his\r\npart. Genuineness implied confession of the past, and confession\r\ninvolved a change of purpose. But Tito had as little bent that way as a\r\nleopard has to lap milk when its teeth are grown. From all relations\r\nthat were not easy and agreeable, we know that Tito shrank: why should\r\nhe cling to them?\r\n\r\nAnd Romola had made his relations difficult with others besides\r\nherself. He had had a troublesome interview with Dolfo Spini, who had\r\ncome back in a rage after an ineffectual soaking with rain and long\r\nwaiting in ambush, and that scene between Romola and himself at Nello\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor, once reported in Spini\xe2\x80\x99s ear, might be a seed of something more\r\nunmanageable than suspicion. But now, at least, he believed that he had\r\nmastered Romola by a terror which appealed to the strongest forces of\r\nher nature. He had alarmed her affection and her conscience by the\r\nshadowy image of consequences; he had arrested her intellect by hanging\r\nbefore it the idea of a hopeless complexity in affairs which defied any\r\nmoral judgment.\r\n\r\nYet Tito was not at ease. The world was not yet quite cushioned with\r\nvelvet, and, if it had been, he could not have abandoned himself to\r\nthat softness with thorough enjoyment; for before he went out again\r\nthis evening he put on his coat of chain-armour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nThe Pyramid of Vanities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wintry days passed for Romola as the white ships pass one who is\r\nstanding lonely on the shore\xe2\x80\x94passing in silence and sameness, yet each\r\nbearing a hidden burden of coming change. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hint had mingled so\r\nmuch dread with her interest in the progress of public affairs that she\r\nhad begun to court ignorance rather than knowledge. The threatening\r\nGerman Emperor was gone again; and, in other ways besides, the position\r\nof Florence was alleviated; but so much distress remained that Romola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nactive duties were hardly diminished, and in these, as usual, her mind\r\nfound a refuge from its doubt.\r\n\r\nShe dared not rejoice that the relief which had come in extremity and\r\nhad appeared to justify the policy of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s party was making that\r\nparty so triumphant, that Francesco Valori, hot-tempered chieftain of\r\nthe Piagnoni, had been elected Gonfaloniere at the beginning of the\r\nyear, and was making haste to have as much of his own liberal way as\r\npossible during his two months of power. That seemed for the moment\r\nlike a strengthening of the party most attached to freedom, and a\r\nreinforcement of protection to Savonarola; but Romola was now alive to\r\nevery suggestion likely to deepen her foreboding, that whatever the\r\npresent might be, it was only an unconscious brooding over the mixed\r\ngerms of Change which might any day become tragic. And already by\r\nCarnival time, a little after mid-February, her presentiment was\r\nconfirmed by the signs of a very decided change: the Mediceans had\r\nceased to be passive, and were openly exerting themselves to procure\r\nthe election of Bernardo del Nero as the new Gonfaloniere.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the Carnival, between ten and eleven in the morning,\r\nRomola walked out, according to promise, towards the Corso degli\r\nAlbizzi, to fetch her cousin Brigida, that they might both be ready to\r\nstart from the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi early in the afternoon, and take their\r\nplaces at a window which Tito had had reserved for them in the Piazza\r\ndella Signoria, where there was to be a scene of so new and striking a\r\nsort, that all Florentine eyes must desire to see it. For the Piagnoni\r\nwere having their own way thoroughly about the mode of keeping the\r\nCarnival. In vain Dolfo Spini and his companions had struggled to get\r\nup the dear old masques and practical jokes, well spiced with\r\nindecency. Such things were not to be in a city where Christ had been\r\ndeclared king.\r\n\r\nRomola set out in that languid state of mind with which every one\r\nenters on a long day of sight-seeing purely for the sake of gratifying\r\na child, or some dear childish friend. The day was certainly an epoch\r\nin carnival-keeping; but this phase of reform had not touched her\r\nenthusiasm: and she did not know that it was an epoch in her own life\r\nwhen _another_ lot would begin to be no longer secretly but visibly\r\nentwined with her own.\r\n\r\nShe chose to go through the great Piazza that she might take a first\r\nsurvey of the unparalleled sight there while she was still alone.\r\nEntering it from the south, she saw something monstrous and\r\nmany-coloured in the shape of a pyramid, or, rather, like a huge\r\nfir-tree, sixty feet high, with shelves on the branches, widening and\r\nwidening towards the base till they reached a circumference of eighty\r\nyards. The Piazza was full of life: slight young figures, in white\r\ngarments, with olive wreaths on their heads, were moving to and fro\r\nabout the base of the pyramidal tree, carrying baskets full of\r\nbright-coloured things; and maturer forms, some in the monastic frock,\r\nsome in the loose tunics and dark-red caps of artists, were helping and\r\nexamining, or else retreating to various points in the distance to\r\nsurvey the wondrous whole: while a considerable group, amongst whom\r\nRomola recognised Piero di Cosimo, standing on the marble steps of\r\nOrgagna\xe2\x80\x99s Loggia, seemed to be keeping aloof in discontent and scorn.\r\n\r\nApproaching nearer, she paused to look at the multifarious objects\r\nranged in gradation from the base to the summit of the pyramid. There\r\nwere tapestries and brocades of immodest design, pictures and\r\nsculptures held too likely to incite to vice; there were boards and\r\ntables for all sorts of games, playing-cards along with the blocks for\r\nprinting them, dice, and other apparatus for gambling; there were\r\nworldly music-books, and musical instruments in all the pretty\r\nvarieties of lute, drum, cymbal, and trumpet; there were masks and\r\nmasquerading-dresses used in the old Carnival shows; there were\r\nhandsome copies of Ovid, Boccaccio, Petrarca, Pulci, and other books of\r\na vain or impure sort; there were all the implements of feminine\r\nvanity\xe2\x80\x94rouge-pots, false hair, mirrors, perfumes, powders, and\r\ntransparent veils intended to provoke inquisitive glances: lastly, at\r\nthe very summit, there was the unflattering effigy of a probably\r\nmythical Venetian merchant, who was understood to have offered a heavy\r\nsum for this collection of marketable abominations, and, soaring above\r\nhim in surpassing ugliness, the symbolic figure of the old debauched\r\nCarnival.\r\n\r\nThis was the preparation for a new sort of bonfire\xe2\x80\x94the Burning of\r\nVanities. Hidden in the interior of the pyramid was a plentiful store\r\nof dry fuel and gunpowder; and on this last day of the festival, at\r\nevening, the pile of vanities was to be set ablaze to the sound of\r\ntrumpets, and the ugly old Carnival was to tumble into the flames amid\r\nthe songs of reforming triumph.\r\n\r\nThis crowning act of the new festivities could hardly have been\r\nprepared but for a peculiar organisation which had been started by\r\nSavonarola two years before. The mass of the Florentine boyhood and\r\nyouth was no longer left to its own genial promptings towards street\r\nmischief and crude dissoluteness. Under the training of Fra Domenico, a\r\nsort of lieutenant to Savonarola, lads and striplings, the hope of\r\nFlorence, were to have none but pure words on their lips, were to have\r\na zeal for Unseen Good that should put to shame the lukewarmness of\r\ntheir elders, and were to know no pleasures save of an angelic\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94singing divine praises and walking in white robes. It was for them\r\nthat the ranges of seats had been raised high against the walls of the\r\nDuomo; and they had been used to hear Savonarola appeal to them as the\r\nfuture glory of a city specially appointed to do the work of God.\r\n\r\nThese fresh-cheeked troops were the chief agents in the regenerated\r\nmerriment of the new Carnival, which was a sort of sacred parody of the\r\nold. Had there been bonfires in the old time? There was to be a bonfire\r\nnow, consuming impurity from off the earth. Had there been symbolic\r\nprocessions? There were to be processions now, but the symbols were to\r\nbe white robes and red crosses and olive wreaths\xe2\x80\x94emblems of peace and\r\ninnocent gladness\xe2\x80\x94and the banners and images held aloft were to tell\r\nthe triumphs of goodness. Had there been dancing in a ring under the\r\nopen sky of the Piazza, to the sound of choral voices chanting loose\r\nsongs? There was to be dancing in a ring now, but dancing of monks and\r\nlaity in fraternal love and divine joy, and the music was to be the\r\nmusic of hymns. As for the collections from street passengers, they\r\nwere to be greater than ever\xe2\x80\x94not for gross and superfluous suppers, but\r\nfor the benefit of the hungry and needy; and, besides, there was the\r\ncollecting of the _Anathema_, or the Vanities to be laid on the great\r\npyramidal bonfire.\r\n\r\nTroops of young inquisitors went from house to house on this exciting\r\nbusiness of asking that the Anathema should be given up to them.\r\nPerhaps, after the more avowed vanities had been surrendered, Madonna,\r\nat the head of the household, had still certain little reddened balls\r\nbrought from the Levant, intended to produce on a sallow cheek a sudden\r\nbloom of the most ingenuous falsity? If so, let her bring them down and\r\ncast them into the basket of doom. Or, perhaps, she had ringlets and\r\ncoils of \xe2\x80\x9cdead hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94if so, let her bring them to the streetdoor, not\r\non her head, but in her hands, and publicly renounce the Anathema which\r\nhid the respectable signs of age under a ghastly mockery of youth. And,\r\nin reward, she would hear fresh young voices pronounce a blessing on\r\nher and her house.\r\n\r\nThe beardless inquisitors, organised into little regiments, doubtless\r\ntook to their work very willingly. To coerce people by shame, or other\r\nspiritual pelting, into the giving up of things it will probably vex\r\nthem to part with, is a form of piety to which the boyish mind is most\r\nreadily converted; and if some obstinately wicked men got enraged and\r\nthreatened the whip or the cudgel, this also was exciting. Savonarola\r\nhimself evidently felt about the training of these boys the difficulty\r\nweighing on all minds with noble yearnings towards great ends, yet with\r\nthat imperfect perception of means which forces a resort to some\r\nsupernatural constraining influence as the only sure hope. The\r\nFlorentine youth had had very evil habits and foul tongues: it seemed\r\nat first an unmixed blessing when they were got to shout \xe2\x80\x9c_Viva Ges\xc3\xb9_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut Savonarola was forced at last to say from the pulpit, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a\r\nlittle too much shouting of \xe2\x80\x98_Viva Ges\xc3\xb9_!\xe2\x80\x99 This constant utterance of\r\nsacred words brings them into contempt. Let me have no more of that\r\nshouting till the next Festa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as the long stream of white-robed youthfulness, with its\r\nlittle red crosses and olive wreaths, had gone to the Duomo at dawn\r\nthis morning to receive the communion from the hands of Savonarola, it\r\nwas a sight of beauty; and, doubtless, many of those young souls were\r\nlaying up memories of hope and awe that might save them from ever\r\nresting in a merely vulgar view of their work as men and citizens.\r\nThere is no kind of conscious obedience that is not an advance on\r\nlawlessness, and these boys became the generation of men who fought\r\ngreatly and endured greatly in the last struggle of their Republic.\r\nNow, in the intermediate hours between the early communion and\r\ndinner-time, they were making their last perambulations to collect alms\r\nand vanities, and this was why Romola saw the slim white figures moving\r\nto and fro about the base of the great pyramid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat think you of this folly, Madonna Romola?\xe2\x80\x9d said a brusque voice\r\nclose to her ear. \xe2\x80\x9cYour Piagnoni will make _l\xe2\x80\x99inferno_ a pleasant\r\nprospect to us, if they are to carry things their own way on earth.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s enough to fetch a cudgel over the mountains to see painters, like\r\nLorenzo di Credi and young Baccio there, helping to burn colour out of\r\nlife in this fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Piero,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, looking up and smiling at the grim man,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceven you must be glad to see some of these things burnt. Look at those\r\ngewgaws and wigs and rouge-pots: I have heard you talk as indignantly\r\nagainst those things as Fra Girolamo himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, turning round on her sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI never said a\r\nwoman should make a black patch of herself against the background. Va!\r\nMadonna Antigone, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame for a woman with your hair and shoulders\r\nto run into such nonsense\xe2\x80\x94leave it to women who are not worth painting.\r\nWhat! the most holy Virgin herself has always been dressed well; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe doctrine of the Church:\xe2\x80\x94talk of heresy, indeed! And I should like\r\nto know what the excellent Messer Bardo would have said to the burning\r\nof the divine poets by these Frati, who are no better an imitation of\r\nmen than if they were onions with the bulbs uppermost. Look at that\r\nPetrarca sticking up beside a rouge-pot: do the idiots pretend that the\r\nheavenly Laura was a painted harridan? And Boccaccio, now: do you mean\r\nto say, Madonna Romola\xe2\x80\x94you who are fit to be a model for a wise Saint\r\nCatherine of Egypt\xe2\x80\x94do you mean to say you have never read the stories\r\nof the immortal Messer Giovanni?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true I have read them, Piero,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of them a\r\ngreat many times over, when I was a little girl. I used to get the book\r\ndown when my father was asleep, so that I could read to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ebbene_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero, in a fiercely challenging tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some things in them I do not want ever to forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRomola; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you must confess, Piero, that a great many of those\r\nstories are only about low deceit for the lowest ends. Men do not want\r\nbooks to make them think lightly of vice, as if life were a vulgar\r\njoke. And I cannot blame Fra Girolamo for teaching that we owe our time\r\nto something better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s very well to say so now you\xe2\x80\x99ve read them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Piero,\r\nbitterly, turning on his heel and walking away from her.\r\n\r\nRomola, too, walked on, smiling at Piero\xe2\x80\x99s innuendo, with a sort of\r\ntenderness towards the old painter\xe2\x80\x99s anger, because she knew that her\r\nfather would have felt something like it. For herself, she was\r\nconscious of no inward collision with the strict and sombre view of\r\npleasure which tended to repress poetry in the attempt to repress vice.\r\nSorrow and joy have each their peculiar narrowness; and a religious\r\nenthusiasm like Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s which ultimately blesses mankind by giving\r\nthe soul a strong propulsion towards sympathy with pain, indignation\r\nagainst wrong, and the subjugation of sensual desire, must always incur\r\nthe reproach of a great negation. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s life had given her an\r\naffinity for sadness which inevitably made her unjust towards\r\nmerriment. That subtle result of culture which we call Taste was\r\nsubdued by the need for deeper motive; just as the nicer demands of the\r\npalate are annihilated by urgent hunger. Moving habitually amongst\r\nscenes of suffering, and carrying woman\xe2\x80\x99s heaviest disappointment in\r\nher heart, the severity which allied itself with self-renouncing\r\nbeneficent strength had no dissonance for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nTessa Abroad and at Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother figure easily recognised by us\xe2\x80\x94a figure not clad in black, but\r\nin the old red, green, and white\xe2\x80\x94was approaching the Piazza that\r\nmorning to see the Carnival. She came from an opposite point, for Tessa\r\nno longer lived on the hill of San Giorgio. After what had happened\r\nthere with Baldassarre, Tito had thought it best for that and other\r\nreasons to find her a new home, but still in a quiet airy quarter, in a\r\nhouse bordering on the wide garden grounds north of the Porta Santa\r\nCroce.\r\n\r\nTessa was not come out sight-seeing without special leave. Tito had\r\nbeen with her the evening before, and she had kept back the entreaty\r\nwhich she felt to be swelling her heart and throat until she saw him in\r\na state of radiant ease, with one arm round the sturdy Lillo, and the\r\nother resting gently on her own shoulder as she tried to make the tiny\r\nNinna steady on her legs. She was sure then that the weariness with\r\nwhich he had come in and flung himself into his chair had quite melted\r\naway from his brow and lips. Tessa had not been slow at learning a few\r\nsmall stratagems by which she might avoid vexing Naldo and yet have a\r\nlittle of her own way. She could read nothing else, but she had learned\r\nto read a good deal in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly the charm of that bright, gentle-humoured Tito who woke\r\nup under the Loggia de\xe2\x80\x99 Cerchi on a Lenten morning five years before,\r\nnot having yet given any hostages to deceit, never returned so nearly\r\nas in the person of Naldo, seated in that straight-backed, carved\r\narm-chair which he had provided for his comfort when he came to see\r\nTessa and the children. Tito himself was surprised at the growing sense\r\nof relief which he felt in these moments. No guile was needed towards\r\nTessa: she was too ignorant and too innocent to suspect him of\r\nanything. And the little voices calling him \xe2\x80\x9cBabbo\xe2\x80\x9d were very sweet in\r\nhis ears for the short while that he heard them. When he thought of\r\nleaving Florence, he never thought of leaving Tessa and the little ones\r\nbehind. He was very fond of these round-cheeked, wide-eyed human things\r\nthat clung about him and knew no evil of him. And wherever affection\r\ncan spring, it is like the green leaf and the blossom\xe2\x80\x94pure, and\r\nbreathing purity, whatever soil it may grow in. Poor Romola, with all\r\nher self-sacrificing effort, was really helping to harden Tito\xe2\x80\x99s nature\r\nby chilling it with a positive dislike which had beforehand seemed\r\nimpossible in him; but Tessa kept open the fountains of kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNinna is very good without me now,\xe2\x80\x9d began Tessa, feeling her request\r\nrising very high in her throat, and letting Ninna seat herself on the\r\nfloor. \xe2\x80\x9cI can leave her with Monna Lisa any time, and if she is in the\r\ncradle and cries, Lillo is as sensible as can be\xe2\x80\x94he goes and thumps\r\nMonna Lisa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLillo, whose great dark eyes looked all the darker because his curls\r\nwere of a light-brown like his mother\xe2\x80\x99s, jumped off Babbo\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and\r\nwent forthwith to attest his intelligence by thumping Monna Lisa, who\r\nwas shaking her head slowly over her spinning at the other end of the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cA wonderful boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa,\r\neagerly, getting a little closer to him; \xe2\x80\x9cand I might go and see the\r\nCarnival to-morrow, just for an hour or two, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you wicked pigeon!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, pinching her cheek; \xe2\x80\x9cthose are your\r\nlongings, are they? What have you to do with carnivals now you are an\r\nold woman with two children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut old women like to see things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, her lower lip hanging a\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x9cMonna Lisa said she should like to go, only she\xe2\x80\x99s so deaf she\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t hear what is behind her, and she thinks we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take care of\r\nboth the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, looking rather grave, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not\r\nthink of taking the children into the crowded streets, else I shall be\r\nangry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have never been into the Piazza without leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, in a\r\nfrightened, pleading tone, \xe2\x80\x9csince the Holy Saturday, and I think Nofri\r\nis dead, for you know the poor _madre_ died; and I shall never forget\r\nthe Carnival I saw once; it was so pretty\xe2\x80\x94all roses and a king and\r\nqueen under them\xe2\x80\x94and singing. I liked it better than the San Giovanni.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like that now, my Tessa. They are going to make a\r\nbonfire in the Piazza\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But I cannot let you go out by\r\nyourself in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go in the evening. I only want to go and\r\nsee the procession by daylight. There _will_ be a procession\xe2\x80\x94is it not\r\ntrue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, after a sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cas lively as a flight of cranes. You\r\nmust not expect roses and glittering kings and queens, my Tessa.\r\nHowever, I suppose any string of people to be called a procession will\r\nplease your blue eyes. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a thing they have raised in the\r\nPiazza de\xe2\x80\x99 Signori for the bonfire. You may like to see that. But come\r\nhome early, and look like a grave little old woman; and if you see any\r\nmen with feathers and swords, keep out of their way: they are very\r\nfierce, and like to cut old women\xe2\x80\x99s heads off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanta Madonna! where do they come from? Ah! you are laughing; it is\r\nnot so bad. But I will keep away from them. Only,\xe2\x80\x9d Tessa went on in a\r\nwhisper, putting her lips near Naldo\xe2\x80\x99s ear, \xe2\x80\x9cif I might take Lillo with\r\nme! He is very sensible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who will thump Monna Lisa then, if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito,\r\nfinding it difficult not to laugh, but thinking it necessary to look\r\nserious. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tessa, you could not take care of Lillo if you got into a\r\ncrowd, and he\xe2\x80\x99s too heavy for you to carry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, rather sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cand he likes to run away. I\r\nforgot that. Then I will go alone. But now look at Ninna\xe2\x80\x94you have not\r\nlooked at her enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNinna was a blue-eyed thing, at the tottering, tumbling age\xe2\x80\x94a fair\r\nsolid, which, like a loaded die, found its base with a constancy that\r\nwarranted prediction. Tessa went to snatch her up, and when Babbo was\r\npaying due attention to the recent teeth and other marvels, she said,\r\nin a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall I buy some confetti for the children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito drew some small coins from his scarsella, and poured them into her\r\npalm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will buy no end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, delighted at this abundance. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall not mind going without Lillo so much, if I bring him something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Tessa set out in the morning towards the great Piazza where the\r\nbonfire was to be. She did not think the February breeze cold enough to\r\ndemand further covering than her green woollen dress. A mantle would\r\nhave been oppressive, for it would have hidden a new necklace and a new\r\nclasp, mounted with silver, the only ornamental presents Tito had ever\r\nmade her. Tessa did not think at all of showing her figure, for no one\r\nhad ever told her it was pretty; but she was quite sure that her\r\nnecklace and clasp were of the prettiest sort ever worn by the richest\r\ncontadina, and she arranged her white hood over her head so that the\r\nfront of her necklace might be well displayed. These ornaments, she\r\nconsidered, must inspire respect for her as the wife of some one who\r\ncould afford to buy them.\r\n\r\nShe tripped along very cheerily in the February sunshine, thinking much\r\nof the purchases for the little ones, with which she was to fill her\r\nsmall basket, and not thinking at all of any one who might be observing\r\nher. Yet her descent from her upper storey into the street had been\r\nwatched, and she was being kept in sight as she walked by a person who\r\nhad often waited in vain to see if it were not Tessa who lived in that\r\nhouse to which he had more than once dogged Tito. Baldassarre was\r\ncarrying a package of yarn: he was constantly employed in that way, as\r\na means of earning his scanty bread, and keeping the sacred fire of\r\nvengeance alive; and he had come out of his way this morning, as he had\r\noften done before, that he might pass by the house to which he had\r\nfollowed Tito in the evening. His long imprisonment had so intensified\r\nhis timid suspicion and his belief in some diabolic fortune favouring\r\nTito, that he had not dared to pursue him, except under cover of a\r\ncrowd or of the darkness; he felt, with instinctive horror, that if\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fell upon him, he should again be held up to obloquy, again\r\nbe dragged away; his weapon would be taken from him, and he should be\r\ncast helpless into a prison-cell. His fierce purpose had become as\r\nstealthy as a serpent\xe2\x80\x99s, which depends for its prey on one dart of the\r\nfang. Justice was weak and unfriended; and he could not hear again the\r\nvoice that pealed the promise of vengeance in the Duomo; he had been\r\nthere again and again, but that voice, too, had apparently been stifled\r\nby cunning strong-armed wickedness. For a long while, Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nruling thought was to ascertain whether Tito still wore the armour, for\r\nnow at last his fainting hope would have been contented with a\r\nsuccessful stab on this side the grave; but he would never risk his\r\nprecious knife again. It was a weary time he had had to wait for the\r\nchance of answering this question by touching Tito\xe2\x80\x99s back in the press\r\nof the street. Since then, the knowledge that the sharp steel was\r\nuseless, and that he had no hope but in some new device, had fallen\r\nwith leaden weight on his enfeebled mind. A dim vision of winning one\r\nof those two wives to aid him came before him continually, and\r\ncontinually slid away. The wife who had lived on the hill was no longer\r\nthere. If he could find her again, he might grasp some thread of a\r\nproject, and work his way to more clearness.\r\n\r\nAnd this morning he had succeeded. He was quite certain now where this\r\nwife lived, and as he walked, bent a little under his burden of yarn,\r\nyet keeping the green and white figure in sight, his mind was dwelling\r\nupon her and her circumstances as feeble eyes dwell on lines and\r\ncolours, trying to interpret them into consistent significance.\r\n\r\nTessa had to pass through various long streets without seeing any other\r\nsign of the Carnival than unusual groups of the country people in their\r\nbest garments, and that disposition in everybody to chat and loiter\r\nwhich marks the early hours of a holiday, before the spectacle has\r\nbegun. Presently, in her disappointed search for remarkable objects,\r\nher eyes fell on a man with a pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s basket before him, who seemed to\r\nbe selling nothing but little red crosses to all the passengers. A\r\nlittle red cross would be pretty to hang up over her bed; it would also\r\nhelp to keep off harm, and would perhaps make Ninna stronger. Tessa\r\nwent to the other side of the street that she might ask the pedlar the\r\nprice of the crosses, fearing that they would cost a little too much\r\nfor her to spare from her purchase of sweets. The pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s back had\r\nbeen turned towards her hitherto, but when she came near him she\r\nrecognised an old acquaintance of the Mercato, Bratti Ferravecchi, and,\r\naccustomed to feel that she was to avoid old acquaintances, she turned\r\naway again and passed to the other side of the street. But Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nwas too well practised in looking out at the corner after possible\r\ncustomers, for her movement to have escaped him, and she was presently\r\narrested by a tap on the arm from one of the red crosses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, as she unwillingly turned her head, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ncome from some castello a good way off, it seems to me, else you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever think of walking about, this blessed Carnival, without a red\r\ncross in your hand. Santa Madonna! Four white quattrini is a small\r\nprice to pay for your soul\xe2\x80\x94prices rise in purgatory, let me tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I should like one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare\r\nfour white quattrini.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBratti had at first regarded Tessa too abstractedly as a mere customer\r\nto look at her with any scrutiny, but when she began to speak he\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the head of San Giovanni, it must be the little Tessa,\r\nand looking as fresh as a ripe apple! What! you\xe2\x80\x99ve done none the worse,\r\nthen, for running away from father Nofri? You were in the right of it,\r\nfor he goes on crutches now, and a crabbed fellow with crutches is\r\ndangerous; he can reach across the house and beat a woman as he sits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m married,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, rather demurely, remembering Naldo\xe2\x80\x99s command\r\nthat she should behave with gravity; \xe2\x80\x9cand my husband takes great care\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, you\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen on your feet! Nofri said you were\r\ngood-for-nothing vermin; but what then? An ass may bray a good while\r\nbefore he shakes the stars down. I always said you did well to run\r\naway, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t often Bratti\xe2\x80\x99s in the wrong. Well, and so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\na husband and plenty of money? Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll never think much of giving\r\nfour white quattrini for a red cross. I get no profit; but what with\r\nthe famine and the new religion, all other merchandise is gone down.\r\nYou live in the country where the chestnuts are plenty, eh? You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever wanted for polenta, I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never wanted anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, still on her guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can afford to buy a cross. I got a Padre to bless them, and\r\nyou get blessing and all for four quattrini. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t for the profit; I\r\nhardly get a danaro by the whole lot. But then they\xe2\x80\x99re holy wares, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s getting harder and harder work to see your way to Paradise: the\r\nvery Carnival is like Holy Week, and the least you can do to keep the\r\nDevil from getting the upper hand is to buy a cross. God guard you!\r\nthink what the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s tooth is! You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him biting the man in San\r\nGiovanni, I should hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa felt much teased and frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bratti,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a\r\ndiscomposed face, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to buy a great many confetti: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got little\r\nLillo and Ninna at home. And nice coloured sweet things cost a great\r\ndeal. And they will not like the cross so well, though I know it would\r\nbe good to have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, fond of laying up a store of merits by\r\nimagining possible extortions and then heroically renouncing them,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince you\xe2\x80\x99re an old acquaintance, you shall have it for two quattrini.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s making you a present of the cross, to say nothing of the\r\nblessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa was reaching out her two quattrini with trembling hesitation,\r\nwhen Bratti said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit! Where do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a long way off,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, almost automatically, being\r\npreoccupied with her quattrini; \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond San Ambrogio, in the Via\r\nPiccola, at the top of the house where the wood is stacked below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, in a patronising tone; \xe2\x80\x9cthen I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you\r\nhave the cross on trust, and call for the money. So you live inside the\r\ngates? Well, well, I shall be passing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, frightened lest Naldo should be angry at this\r\nrevival of an old acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cI can spare the money. Take it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, resolutely; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a hard-hearted pedlar. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall and see if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got any rags, and you shall make a bargain. See,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s the cross: and there\xe2\x80\x99s Pippo\xe2\x80\x99s shop not far behind you: you can\r\ngo and fill your basket, and I must go and get mine empty. _Addio,\r\npiccina_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBratti went on his way, and Tessa, stimulated to change her money into\r\nconfetti before further accident, went into Pippo\xe2\x80\x99s shop, a little\r\nfluttered by the thought that she had let Bratti know more about her\r\nthan her husband would approve. There were certainly more dangers in\r\ncoming to see the Carnival than in staying at home; and she would have\r\nfelt this more strongly if she had known that the wicked old man, who\r\nhad wanted to kill her husband on the hill, was still keeping her in\r\nsight. But she had not noticed the man with the burden on his back.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of having a small basketful of things to make the\r\nchildren glad dispersed her anxiety, and as she entered the Via de\xe2\x80\x99\r\nLibraj her face had its visual expression of childlike content. And now\r\nshe thought there was really a procession coming, for she saw white\r\nrobes and a banner, and her heart began to palpitate with expectation.\r\nShe stood a little aside, but in that narrow street there was the\r\npleasure of being obliged to look very close. The banner was pretty: it\r\nwas the Holy Mother with the Babe, whose love for her Tessa had\r\nbelieved in more and more since she had had her babies; and the figures\r\nin white had not only green wreaths on their heads, but little red\r\ncrosses by their side, which caused her some satisfaction that she also\r\nhad her red cross. Certainly, they looked as beautiful as the angels on\r\nthe clouds, and to Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s mind they too had a background of cloud,\r\nlike everything else that came to her in life. How and whence did they\r\ncome? She did not mind much about knowing. But one thing surprised her\r\nas newer than wreaths and crosses; it was that some of the white\r\nfigures carried baskets between them. What could the baskets be for?\r\n\r\nBut now they were very near, and, to her astonishment, they wheeled\r\naside and came straight up to her. She trembled as she would have done\r\nif Saint Michael in the picture had shaken his head at her, and was\r\nconscious of nothing but terrified wonder till she saw close to her a\r\nround boyish face, lower than her own, and heard a treble voice saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister, you carry the Anathema about you. Yield it up to the blessed\r\nGesu, and He will adorn you with the gems of His grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa was only more frightened, understanding nothing. Her first\r\nconjecture settled on her basket of sweets. They wanted that, these\r\nalarming angels. Oh dear, dear! She looked down at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said a taller youth, pointing to her necklace and the\r\nclasp of her belt, \xe2\x80\x9cit is those vanities that are the Anathema. Take\r\noff that necklace and unclasp that belt, that they may be burned in the\r\nholy Bonfire of Vanities, and save _you_ from burning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the truth, my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said a still taller youth, evidently the\r\narchangel of this band. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to these voices speaking the divine\r\nmessage. You already carry a red cross: let that be your only\r\nadornment. Yield up your necklace and belt, and you shall obtain\r\ngrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was too much. Tessa, overcome with awe, dared not say \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nshe was equally unable to render up her beloved necklace and clasp. Her\r\npouting lips were quivering, the tears rushed to her eyes, and a great\r\ndrop fell. For a moment she ceased to see anything; she felt nothing\r\nbut confused terror and misery. Suddenly a gentle hand was laid on her\r\narm, and a soft, wonderful voice, as if the Holy Madonna were speaking,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cDo not be afraid; no one shall harm you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa looked up and saw a lady in black, with a young heavenly face and\r\nloving hazel eyes. She had never seen any one like this lady before,\r\nand under other circumstances might have had awestruck thoughts about\r\nher; but now everything else was overcome by the sense that loving\r\nprotection was near her. The tears only fell the faster, relieving her\r\nswelling heart, as she looked up at the heavenly face, and, putting her\r\nhand to her necklace, said sobbingly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t give them to be burnt. My husband\xe2\x80\x94he bought them for me\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthey are so pretty\xe2\x80\x94and Ninna\xe2\x80\x94oh, I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not ask her for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, speaking to the white-robed\r\nboys in a tone of mild authority. \xe2\x80\x9cIt answers no good end for people to\r\ngive up such things against their will. That is not what Fra Girolamo\r\napproves: he would have such things given up freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadonna Romola\xe2\x80\x99s word was not to be resisted, and the white train moved\r\non. They even moved with haste, as if some new object had caught their\r\neyes; and Tessa felt with bliss that they were gone, and that her\r\nnecklace and clasp were still with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will go back to the house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still agitated; \xe2\x80\x9cI will go\r\nnowhere else. But if I should meet them again, and you not be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, expecting everything from this heavenly lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cCome with me under this doorway, and we\r\nwill hide the necklace and clasp, and then you will be in no danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led Tessa under the archway, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, can we find room for\r\nyour necklace and belt in your basket? Ah! your basket is full of crisp\r\nthings that will break: let us be careful, and lay the heavy necklace\r\nunder them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was like a change in a dream to Tessa\xe2\x80\x94the escape from nightmare into\r\nfloating safety and joy\xe2\x80\x94to find herself taken care of by this lady, so\r\nlovely, and powerful, and gentle. She let Romola unfasten her necklace\r\nand clasp, while she herself did nothing but look up at the face that\r\nbent over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are sweets for Lillo and Ninna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as Romola carefully\r\nlifted up the light parcels in the basket, and placed the ornaments\r\nbelow them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are your children?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would rather\r\ngo home to them than see any more of the Carnival? Else you have not\r\nfar to go to the Piazza de\xe2\x80\x99 Signori, and there you would see the pile\r\nfor the great bonfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, oh no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never like bonfires again. I\r\nwill go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou live at some castello, doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, not waiting for an\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cTowards which gate do you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowards Por\xe2\x80\x99 Santa Croce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, taking her by the hand and leading her to\r\nthe corner of a street nearly opposite. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go down there,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, pausing, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will soon be in a straight road. And I must leave\r\nyou now, because some one else expects me. You will not be frightened.\r\nYour pretty things are quite safe now. Addio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAddio, Madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, almost in a whisper, not knowing what\r\nelse it would be right to say; and in an instant the heavenly lady was\r\ngone. Tessa turned to catch a last glimpse, but she only saw the tall\r\ngliding figure vanish round the projecting stonework. So she went on\r\nher way in wonder, longing to be once more safely housed with Monna\r\nLisa, undesirous of carnivals for evermore.\r\n\r\nBaldassarre had kept Tessa in sight till the moment of her parting with\r\nRomola: then he went away with his bundle of yarn. It seemed to him\r\nthat he had discerned a clue which might guide him if he could only\r\ngrasp the necessary details firmly enough. He had seen the two wives\r\ntogether, and the sight had brought to his conceptions that vividness\r\nwhich had been wanting before. His power of imagining facts needed to\r\nbe reinforced continually by the senses. The tall wife was the noble\r\nand rightful wife; she had the blood in her that would be readily\r\nkindled to resentment; she would know what scholarship was, and how it\r\nmight lie locked in by the obstructions of the stricken body, like a\r\ntreasure buried by earthquake. She could believe him: she would be\r\n_inclined_ to believe him, if he proved to her that her husband was\r\nunfaithful. Women cared about that: they would take vengeance for that.\r\nIf this wife of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s loved him, she would have a sense of injury\r\nwhich Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s mind dwelt on with keen longing, as if it would be\r\nthe strength of another Will added to his own, the strength of another\r\nmind to form devices.\r\n\r\nBoth these wives had been kind to Baldassarre, and their acts towards\r\nhim, being bound up with the very image of them, had not vanished from\r\nhis memory; yet the thought of their pain could not present itself to\r\nhim as a check. To him it seemed that pain was the order of the world\r\nfor all except the hard and base. If any were innocent, if any were\r\nnoble, where could the utmost gladness lie for them? Where it lay for\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94in unconquerable hatred and triumphant vengeance. But he must be\r\ncautious: he must watch this wife in the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, and learn more\r\nof her; for even here frustration was possible. There was no power for\r\nhim now but in patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nMonna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s Conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Romola said that some one else expected her, she meant her cousin\r\nBrigida, but she was far from suspecting how much that good kinswoman\r\nwas in need of her. Returning together towards the Piazza, they had\r\ndescried the company of youths coming to a stand before Tessa, and when\r\nRomola, having approached near enough to see the simple little\r\ncontadina\xe2\x80\x99s distress, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWait for me a moment, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d Monna\r\nBrigida said hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I will not go on: come for me to Boni\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop,\xe2\x80\x94I shall go back there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth was, Monna Brigida had a consciousness on the one hand of\r\ncertain \xe2\x80\x9cvanities\xe2\x80\x9d carried on her person, and on the other of a growing\r\nalarm lest the Piagnoni should be right in holding that rouge, and\r\nfalse hair, and pearl embroidery, endamaged the soul. Their serious\r\nview of things filled the air like an odour; nothing seemed to have\r\nexactly the same flavour as it used to have; and there was the dear\r\nchild Romola, in her youth and beauty, leading a life that was\r\nuncomfortably suggestive of rigorous demands on woman. A widow at\r\nfifty-five whose satisfaction has been largely drawn from what she\r\nthinks of her own person, and what she believes others think of it,\r\nrequires a great fund of imagination to keep her spirits buoyant. And\r\nMonna Brigida had begun to have frequent struggles at her toilet. If\r\nher soul would prosper better without them, was it really worth while\r\nto put on the rouge and the braids? But when she lifted up the\r\nhand-mirror and saw a sallow face with baggy cheeks, and crows\xe2\x80\x99-feet\r\nthat were not to be dissimulated by any simpering of the lips\xe2\x80\x94when she\r\nparted her grey hair, and let it lie in simple Piagnone fashion round\r\nher face, her courage failed. Monna Berta would certainly burst out\r\nlaughing at her, and call her an old hag, and as Monna Berta was really\r\nonly fifty-two, she had a superiority which would make the observation\r\ncutting. Every woman who was not a Piagnone would give a shrug at the\r\nsight of her, and the men would accost her as if she were their\r\ngrandmother. Whereas, at fifty-five a woman was not so very old\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nonly required making up a little. So the rouge and the braids and the\r\nembroidered berretta went on again, and Monna Brigida was satisfied\r\nwith the accustomed effect; as for her neck, if she covered it up,\r\npeople might suppose it was too old to show, and, on the contrary, with\r\nthe necklaces round it, it looked better than Monna Berta\xe2\x80\x99s. This very\r\nday, when she was preparing for the Piagnone Carnival, such a struggle\r\nhad occurred, and the conflicting fears and longings which caused the\r\nstruggle, caused her to turn back and seek refuge in the druggist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop rather than encounter the collectors of the Anathema when Romola\r\nwas not by her side. But Monna Brigida was not quite rapid enough in\r\nher retreat. She had been descried, even before she turned away, by the\r\nwhite-robed boys in the rear of those who wheeled round towards Tessa,\r\nand the willingness with which Tessa was given up was, perhaps,\r\nslightly due to the fact that part of the troop had already accosted a\r\npersonage carrying more markedly upon her the dangerous weight of the\r\nAnathema. It happened that several of this troop were at the youngest\r\nage taken into peculiar training; and a small fellow of ten, his olive\r\nwreath resting above cherubic cheeks and wide brown eyes, his\r\nimagination really possessed with a hovering awe at existence as\r\nsomething in which great consequences impended on being good or bad,\r\nhis longings nevertheless running in the direction of mastery and\r\nmischief, was the first to reach Monna Brigida and place himself across\r\nher path. She felt angry, and looked for an open door, but there was\r\nnot one at hand, and by attempting to escape now, she would only make\r\nthings worse. But it was not the cherubic-faced young one who first\r\naddressed her; it was a youth of fifteen, who held one handle of a wide\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVenerable mother!\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthe blessed Jesus commands you to give\r\nup the Anathema which you carry upon you. That cap embroidered with\r\npearls, those jewels that fasten up your false hair\xe2\x80\x94let them be given\r\nup and sold for the poor; and cast the hair itself away from you, as a\r\nlie that is only fit for burning. Doubtless, too, you have other jewels\r\nunder your silk mantle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth at the other handle, who had many of Fra\r\nGirolamo\xe2\x80\x99s phrases by heart, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are too heavy for you: they are\r\nheavier than a millstone, and are weighting you for perdition. Will you\r\nadorn yourself with the hunger of the poor, and be proud to carry God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncurse upon your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth you are old, buona madre,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cherubic boy, in a sweet\r\nsoprano. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look very ugly with the red on your cheeks and that black\r\nglistening hair, and those fine things. It is only Satan who can like\r\nto see you. Your Angel is sorry. He wants you to rub away the red.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little fellow snatched a soft silk scarf from the basket, and held\r\nit towards Monna Brigida, that she might use it as her guardian angel\r\ndesired. Her anger and mortification were fast giving way to spiritual\r\nalarm. Monna Berta and that cloud of witnesses, highly-dressed society\r\nin general, were not looking at her, and she was surrounded by young\r\nmonitors, whose white robes, and wreaths, and red crosses, and dreadful\r\ncandour, had something awful in their unusualness. Her Franciscan\r\nconfessor, Fra Cristoforo, of Santa Croce, was not at hand to reinforce\r\nher distrust of Dominican teaching, and she was helplessly possessed\r\nand shaken by a vague sense that a supreme warning was come to her.\r\nUnvisited by the least suggestion of any other course that was open to\r\nher, she took the scarf that was held out, and rubbed her cheeks, with\r\ntrembling submissiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well, madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said the second youth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a holy beginning.\r\nAnd when you have taken those vanities from your head, the dew of\r\nheavenly grace will descend on it.\xe2\x80\x9d The infusion of mischief was\r\ngetting stronger, and putting his hand to one of the jewelled pins that\r\nfastened her braids to the berretta, he drew it out. The heavy black\r\nplait fell down over Monna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s face, and dragged the rest of the\r\nhead-gear forward. It was a new reason for not hesitating: she put up\r\nher hands hastily, undid the other fastenings, and flung down into the\r\nbasket of doom her beloved crimson-velvet berretta, with all its\r\nunsurpassed embroidery of seed-pearls, and stood an unrouged woman,\r\nwith grey hair pushed backward from a face where certain deep lines of\r\nage had triumphed over _embonpoint_.\r\n\r\nBut the berretta was not allowed to lie in the basket. With impish zeal\r\nthe youngsters lifted it, and held it up pitilessly, with the false\r\nhair dangling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, venerable mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller youth, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ugly lies you\r\nhave delivered yourself from! And now you look like the blessed Saint\r\nAnna, the mother of the Holy Virgin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThoughts of going into a convent forthwith, and never showing herself\r\nin the world again, were rushing through Monna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s mind. There\r\nwas nothing possible for her but to take care of her soul.\r\n\r\nOf course, there were spectators laughing: she had no need to look\r\nround to assure herself of that. Well! it would, perhaps, be better to\r\nbe forced to think more of Paradise. But at the thought that the dear\r\naccustomed world was no longer in her choice, there gathered some of\r\nthose hard tears which just moisten elderly eyes, and she could see but\r\ndimly a large rough hand holding a red cross, which was suddenly thrust\r\nbefore her over the shoulders of the boys, while a strong guttural\r\nvoice said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly four quattrini, madonna, blessing and all! Buy it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find a\r\ncomfort in it now your wig\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Deh! what are we sinners doing all\r\nour lives? Making soup in a basket, and getting nothing but the scum\r\nfor our stomachs. Better buy a blessing, madonna! Only four quattrini;\r\nthe profit is not so much as the smell of a danaro, and it goes to the\r\npoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonna Brigida, in dim-eyed confusion, was proceeding to the further\r\nsubmission of reaching money from her embroidered scarsella, at present\r\nhidden by her silk mantle, when the group round her, which she had not\r\nyet entertained the idea of escaping, opened before a figure as welcome\r\nas an angel loosing prison-bolts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola, look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Monna Brigida, in a piteous tone, putting\r\nout both her hands.\r\n\r\nThe white troop was already moving away, with a slight consciousness\r\nthat its zeal about the head-gear had been superabundant enough to\r\nafford a dispensation from any further demand for penitential\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear cousin, don\xe2\x80\x99t be distressed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, smitten with pity, yet\r\nhardly able to help smiling at the sudden apparition of her kinswoman\r\nin a genuine, natural guise, strangely contrasted with all memories of\r\nher. She took the black drapery from her own head, and threw it over\r\nMonna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on soothingly, \xe2\x80\x9cno one will remark\r\nyou now. We will turn down the Via del Palagio and go straight to our\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hastened away, Monna Brigida grasping Romola\xe2\x80\x99s hand tightly, as if\r\nto get a stronger assurance of her being actually there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my Romola, my dear child!\xe2\x80\x9d said the short fat woman, hurrying with\r\nfrequent steps to keep pace with the majestic young figure beside her;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat an old scarecrow I am! I must be good\xe2\x80\x94I mean to be good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; buy a cross!\xe2\x80\x9d said the guttural voice, while the rough hand\r\nwas thrust once more before Monna Brigida: for Bratti was not to be\r\nabashed by Romola\xe2\x80\x99s presence into renouncing a probable customer, and\r\nhad quietly followed up their retreat. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly four quattrini, blessing\r\nand all\xe2\x80\x94and if there was any profit, it would all go to the poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonna Brigida would have been compelled to pause, even if she had been\r\nin a less submissive mood. She put up one hand deprecatingly to arrest\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrance, and with the other reached out a grosso, worth\r\nmany white quattrini, saying, in an entreating tone\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, good man, and begone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in the right, madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, taking the coin quickly,\r\nand thrusting the cross into her hand; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not offer you change, for\r\nI might as well rob you of a mass. What! we must all be scorched a\r\nlittle, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll come off the easier; better fall from the window\r\nthan the roof. A good Easter and a good year to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Monna Brigida, pathetically, as Bratti left them,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99m to be a Piagnone it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter how I look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, smiling at her affectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how much better you look than you ever did before. I see now how\r\ngood-natured your face is, like yourself. That red and finery seemed to\r\nthrust themselves forward and hide expression. Ask our Piero or any\r\nother painter if he would not rather paint your portrait now than\r\nbefore. I think all lines of the human face have something either\r\ntouching or grand, unless they seem to come from low passions. How fine\r\nold men are, like my godfather! Why should not old women look grand and\r\nsimple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when one gets to be sixty, my Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brigida, relapsing a\r\nlittle; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m only fifty-five, and Monna Berta, and everybody\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s no use: I will be good, like you. Your mother, if she\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nalive, would have been as old as I am; we were cousins together. One\r\n_must_ either die or get old. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter about being old, if\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s a Piagnone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nA Prophetess.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incidents of that Carnival day seemed to Romola to carry no other\r\npersonal consequences to her than the new care of supporting poor\r\ncousin Brigida in her fluctuating resignation to age and grey hairs;\r\nbut they introduced a Lenten time in which she was kept at a high pitch\r\nof mental excitement and active effort.\r\n\r\nBernardo del Nero had been elected Gonfaloniere. By great exertions the\r\nMedicean party had so far triumphed, and that triumph had deepened\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s presentiment of some secretly-prepared scheme likely to ripen\r\neither into success or betrayal during these two months of her\r\ngodfather\xe2\x80\x99s authority. Every morning the dim daybreak as it peered into\r\nher room seemed to be that haunting fear coming back to her. Every\r\nmorning the fear went with her as she passed through the streets on her\r\nway to the early sermon in the Duomo: but there she gradually lost the\r\nsense of its chill presence, as men lose the dread of death in the\r\nclash of battle.\r\n\r\nIn the Duomo she felt herself sharing in a passionate conflict which\r\nhad wider relations than any enclosed within the walls of Florence. For\r\nSavonarola was preaching\xe2\x80\x94preaching the last course of Lenten sermons he\r\nwas ever allowed to finish in the Duomo: he knew that excommunication\r\nwas imminent, and he had reached the point of defying it. He held up\r\nthe condition of the Church in the terrible mirror of his unflinching\r\nspeech, which called things by their right names and dealt in no polite\r\nperiphrases; he proclaimed with heightening confidence the advent of\r\nrenovation\xe2\x80\x94of a moment when there would be a general revolt against\r\ncorruption. As to his own destiny, he seemed to have a double and\r\nalternating prevision: sometimes he saw himself taking a glorious part\r\nin that revolt, sending forth a voice that would be heard through all\r\nChristendom, and making the dead body of the Church tremble into new\r\nlife, as the body of Lazarus trembled when the Divine voice pierced the\r\nsepulchre; sometimes he saw no prospect for himself but persecution and\r\nmartyrdom:\xe2\x80\x94this life for him was only a vigil, and only after death\r\nwould come the dawn.\r\n\r\nThe position was one which must have had its impressiveness for all\r\nminds that were not of the dullest order, even if they were inclined,\r\nas Macchiavelli was, to interpret the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s character by a key that\r\npresupposed no loftiness. To Romola, whose kindred ardour gave her a\r\nfirm belief in Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s genuine greatness of purpose, the crisis\r\nwas as stirring as if it had been part of her personal lot. It blent\r\nitself as an exalting memory with all her daily labours; and those\r\nlabours were calling not only for difficult perseverance, but for new\r\ncourage. Famine had never yet taken its flight from Florence, and all\r\ndistress, by its long continuance, was getting harder to bear; disease\r\nwas spreading in the crowded city, and the Plague was expected. As\r\nRomola walked, often in weariness, among the sick, the hungry, and the\r\nmurmuring, she felt it good to be inspired by something more than her\r\npity\xe2\x80\x94by the belief in a heroism struggling for sublime ends, towards\r\nwhich the daily action of her pity could only tend feebly, as the dews\r\nthat freshen the weedy ground to-day tend to prepare an unseen harvest\r\nin the years to come.\r\n\r\nBut that mighty music which stirred her in the Duomo was not without\r\nits jarring notes. Since those first days of glowing hope when the\r\nFrate, seeing the near triumph of good in the reform of the Republic\r\nand the coming of the French deliverer, had preached peace, charity,\r\nand oblivion of political differences, there had been a marked change\r\nof conditions: political intrigue had been too obstinate to allow of\r\nthe desired oblivion; the belief in the French deliverer, who had\r\nturned his back on his high mission, seemed to have wrought harm; and\r\nhostility, both on a petty and on a grand scale, was attacking the\r\nProphet with new weapons and new determination.\r\n\r\nIt followed that the spirit of contention and self-vindication pierced\r\nmore and more conspicuously in his sermons; that he was urged to meet\r\nthe popular demands not only by increased insistence and detail\r\nconcerning visions and private revelations, but by a tone of defiant\r\nconfidence against objectors; and from having denounced the desire for\r\nthe miraculous, and declared that miracles had no relation to true\r\nfaith, he had come to assert that at the right moment the Divine power\r\nwould attest the truth of his prophetic preaching by a miracle. And\r\ncontinually, in the rapid transitions of excited feeling, as the vision\r\nof triumphant good receded behind the actual predominance of evil, the\r\nthreats of coming vengeance against vicious tyrants and corrupt priests\r\ngathered some impetus from personal exasperation, as well as from\r\nindignant zeal.\r\n\r\nIn the career of a great public orator who yields himself to the\r\ninspiration of the moment, that conflict of selfish and unselfish\r\nemotion which in most men is hidden in the chamber of the soul, is\r\nbrought into terrible evidence: the language of the inner voices is\r\nwritten out in letters of fire.\r\n\r\nBut if the tones of exasperation jarred on Romola, there was often\r\nanother member of Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s audience to whom they were the only\r\nthrilling tones, like the vibration of deep bass notes to the deaf.\r\nBaldassarre had found out that the wonderful Frate was preaching again,\r\nand as often as he could, he went to hear the Lenten sermon, that he\r\nmight drink in the threats of a voice which seemed like a power on the\r\nside of justice. He went the more because he had seen that Romola went\r\ntoo; for he was waiting and watching for a time when not only outward\r\ncircumstances, but his own varying mental state, would mark the right\r\nmoment for seeking an interview with her. Twice Romola had caught sight\r\nof his face in the Duomo\xe2\x80\x94once when its dark glance was fixed on hers.\r\nShe wished not to see it again, and yet she looked for it, as men look\r\nfor the reappearance of a portent. But any revelation that might be yet\r\nto come about this old man was a subordinate fear now: it referred, she\r\nthought, only to the past, and her anxiety was almost absorbed by the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nYet the stirring Lent passed by; April, the second and final month of\r\nher godfather\xe2\x80\x99s supreme authority, was near its close; and nothing had\r\noccurred to fulfil her presentiment. In the public mind, too, there had\r\nbeen fears, and rumours had spread from Rome of a menacing activity on\r\nthe part of Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici; but in a few days the suspected Bernardo\r\nwould go out of power.\r\n\r\nRomola was trying to gather some courage from the review of her futile\r\nfears, when on the twenty-seventh, as she was walking out on her usual\r\nerrands of mercy in the afternoon, she was met by a messenger from\r\nCamilla Rucellai, chief among the feminine seers of Florence, desiring\r\nher presence forthwith on matters of the highest moment. Romola, who\r\nshrank with unconquerable repulsion from the shrill volubility of those\r\nilluminated women, and had just now a special repugnance towards\r\nCamilla because of a report that she had announced revelations hostile\r\nto Bernardo del Nero, was at first inclined to send back a flat\r\nrefusal. Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s message might refer to public affairs, and Romola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimmediate prompting was to close her ears against knowledge that might\r\nonly make her mental burden heavier. But it had become so thoroughly\r\nher habit to reject her impulsive choice, and to obey passively the\r\nguidance of outward claims, that, reproving herself for allowing her\r\npresentiments to make her cowardly and selfish, she ended by\r\ncompliance, and went straight to Camilla.\r\n\r\nShe found the nervous grey-haired woman in a chamber arranged as much\r\nas possible like a convent cell. The thin fingers clutching Romola as\r\nshe sat, and the eager voice addressing her at first in a loud whisper,\r\ncaused her a physical shrinking that made it difficult for her to keep\r\nher seat.\r\n\r\nCamilla had a vision to communicate\xe2\x80\x94a vision in which it had been\r\nrevealed to her by Romola\xe2\x80\x99s Angel, that Romola knew certain secrets\r\nconcerning her godfather, Bernardo del Nero, which, if disclosed, might\r\nsave the Republic from peril. Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s voice rose louder and higher as\r\nshe narrated her vision, and ended by exhorting Romola to obey the\r\ncommand of her Angel, and separate herself from the enemy of God.\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s impetuosity was that of a massive nature, and, except in\r\nmoments when she was deeply stirred, her manner was calm and\r\nself-controlled. She had a constitutional disgust for the shallow\r\nexcitability of women like Camilla, whose faculties seemed all wrought\r\nup into fantasies, leaving nothing for emotion and thought. The\r\nexhortation was not yet ended when she started up and attempted to\r\nwrench her arm from Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s tightening grasp. It was of no use. The\r\nprophetess kept her hold like a crab, and, only incited to more eager\r\nexhortation by Romola\xe2\x80\x99s resistance, was carried beyond her own\r\nintention into a shrill statement of other visions which were to\r\ncorroborate this. Christ himself had appeared to her and ordered her to\r\nsend his commands to certain citizens in office that they should throw\r\nBernardo del Nero from the window of the Palazzo Vecchio. Fra Girolamo\r\nhimself knew of it, and had not dared this time to say that the vision\r\nwas not of Divine authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd since then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla, in her excited treble, straining upward\r\nwith wild eyes towards Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Blessed Infant has come to\r\nme and laid a wafer of sweetness on my tongue in token of his pleasure\r\nthat I had done his will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in a deep voice of anger. \xe2\x80\x9cGod grant you are\r\nmad! else you are detestably wicked!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe violence of her effort to be free was too strong for Camilla now.\r\nShe wrenched away her arm and rushed out of the room, not pausing till\r\nshe had hurriedly gone far along the street, and found herself close to\r\nthe church of the Badia. She had but to pass behind the curtain under\r\nthe old stone arch, and she would find a sanctuary shut in from the\r\nnoise and hurry of the street, where all objects and all uses suggested\r\nthe thought of an eternal peace subsisting in the midst of turmoil.\r\n\r\nShe turned in, and sinking down on the step of the altar in front of\r\nFilippino Lippi\xe2\x80\x99s serene Virgin appearing to Saint Bernard, she waited\r\nin hope that the inward tumult which agitated her would by-and-by\r\nsubside.\r\n\r\nThe thought which pressed on her the most acutely was that Camilla\r\ncould allege Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s countenance of her wicked folly. Romola did\r\nnot for a moment believe that he had sanctioned the throwing of\r\nBernardo del Nero from the window as a Divine suggestion; she felt\r\ncertain that there was falsehood or mistake in that allegation.\r\nSavonarola had become more and more severe in his views of resistance\r\nto malcontents; but the ideas of strict law and order were fundamental\r\nto all his political teaching. Still, since he knew the possibly fatal\r\neffects of visions like Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s, since he had a marked distrust of\r\nsuch spirit-seeing women, and kept aloof from them as much as possible,\r\nwhy, with his readiness to denounce wrong from the pulpit, did he not\r\npublicly denounce these pretended revelations which brought new\r\ndarkness instead of light across the conception of a Supreme Will? Why?\r\nThe answer came with painful clearness: he was fettered inwardly by the\r\nconsciousness that such revelations were not, in their basis,\r\ndistinctly separable from his own visions; he was fettered outwardly by\r\nthe foreseen consequence of raising a cry against himself even among\r\nmembers of his own party, as one who would suppress all Divine\r\ninspiration of which he himself was not the vehicle\xe2\x80\x94he or his\r\nconfidential and supplementary seer of visions, Fra Salvestro.\r\n\r\nRomola, kneeling with buried face on the altar-step, was enduring one\r\nof those sickening moments, when the enthusiasm which had come to her\r\nas the only energy strong enough to make life worthy, seemed to be\r\ninevitably bound up with vain dreams and wilful eye-shutting. Her mind\r\nrushed back with a new attraction towards the strong worldly sense, the\r\ndignified prudence, the untheoretic virtues of her godfather, who was\r\nto be treated as a sort of Agag because he held that a more restricted\r\nform of government was better than the Great Council, and because he\r\nwould not pretend to forget old ties to the banished family.\r\n\r\nBut with this last thought rose the presentiment of some plot to\r\nrestore the Medici; and then again she felt that the popular party was\r\nhalf justified in its fierce suspicion. Again she felt that to keep the\r\nGovernment of Florence pure, and to keep out a vicious rule, was a\r\nsacred cause; the Frate was right there, and had carried her\r\nunderstanding irrevocably with him. But at this moment the assent of\r\nher understanding went alone; it was given unwillingly. Her heart was\r\nrecoiling from a right allied to so much narrowness; a right apparently\r\nentailing that hard systematic judgment of men which measures them by\r\nassents and denials quite superficial to the manhood within them. Her\r\naffection and respect were clinging with new tenacity to her godfather,\r\nand with him to those memories of her father which were in the same\r\nopposition to the division of men into sheep and goats by the easy mark\r\nof some political or religious symbol.\r\n\r\nAfter all has been said that can be said about the widening influence\r\nof ideas, it remains true that they would hardly be such strong agents\r\nunless they were taken in a solvent of feeling. The great\r\nworld-struggle of developing thought is continually foreshadowed in the\r\nstruggle of the affections, seeking a justification for love and hope.\r\n\r\nIf Romola\xe2\x80\x99s intellect had been less capable of discerning the\r\ncomplexities in human things, all the early loving associations of her\r\nlife would have forbidden her to accept implicitly the denunciatory\r\nexclusiveness of Savonarola. She had simply felt that his mind had\r\nsuggested deeper and more efficacious truth to her than any other, and\r\nthe large breathing-room she found in his grand view of human duties\r\nhad made her patient towards that part of his teaching which she could\r\nnot absorb, so long as its practical effect came into collision with no\r\nstrong force in her. But now a sudden insurrection of feeling had\r\nbrought about that collision. Her indignation, once roused by Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisions, could not pause there, but ran like an illuminating fire over\r\nall the kindred facts in Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s teaching, and for the moment she\r\nfelt what was true in the scornful sarcasms she heard continually flung\r\nagainst him, more keenly than she felt what was false.\r\n\r\nBut it was an illumination that made all life look ghastly to her.\r\nWhere were the beings to whom she could cling, with whom she could work\r\nand endure, with the belief that she was working for the right? On the\r\nside from which moral energy came lay a fanaticism from which she was\r\nshrinking with newly-startled repulsion; on the side to which she was\r\ndrawn by affection and memory, there was the presentiment of some\r\nsecret plotting, which her judgment told her would not be unfairly\r\ncalled crime. And still surmounting every other thought was the dread\r\ninspired by Tito\xe2\x80\x99s hints, lest that presentiment should be converted\r\ninto knowledge, in such a way that she would be torn by irreconcilable\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nCalmness would not come even on the altar-steps; it would not come from\r\nlooking at the serene picture where the saint, writing in the rocky\r\nsolitude, was being visited by faces with celestial peace in them.\r\nRomola was in the hard press of human difficulties, and that rocky\r\nsolitude was too far off. She rose from her knees that she might hasten\r\nto her sick people in the courtyard, and by some immediate beneficent\r\naction, revive that sense of worth in life which at this moment was\r\nunfed by any wider faith. But when she turned round, she found herself\r\nface to face with a man who was standing only two yards off her. The\r\nman was Baldassarre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nOn San Miniato.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would speak with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, as Romola looked at him in\r\nsilent expectation. It was plain that he had followed her, and had been\r\nwaiting for her. She was going at last to know the secret about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the same sort of submission that she might have\r\nshown under an imposed penance. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you wish to go where no one can\r\nhear us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere _he_ will not come upon us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, turning and\r\nglancing behind him timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cOut\xe2\x80\x94in the air\xe2\x80\x94away from the streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes go to San Miniato at this hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nlike, I will go now, and you can follow me. It is far, but we can be\r\nsolitary there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded assent, and Romola set out. To some women it might have\r\nseemed an alarming risk to go to a comparatively solitary spot with a\r\nman who had some of the outward signs of that madness which Tito\r\nattributed to him. But Romola was not given to personal fears, and she\r\nwas glad of the distance that interposed some delay before another blow\r\nfell on her. The afternoon was far advanced, and the sun was already\r\nlow in the west, when she paused on some rough ground in the shadow of\r\nthe cypress-trunks, and looked round for Baldassarre. He was not far\r\noff, but when he reached her, he was glad to sink down on an edge of\r\nstony earth. His thickset frame had no longer the sturdy vigour which\r\nbelonged to it when he first appeared with the rope round him in the\r\nDuomo; and under the transient tremor caused by the exertion of walking\r\nup the hill, his eyes seemed to have a more helpless vagueness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hill is steep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, with compassionate gentleness,\r\nseating herself by him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I fear you have been weakened by want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his head and fixed his eyes on her in silence, unable, now\r\nthe moment of speech was come, to seize the words that would convey the\r\nthought he wanted to utter: and she remained as motionless as she\r\ncould, lest he should suppose her impatient. He looked like nothing\r\nhigher than a common-bred, neglected old man; but she was used now to\r\nbe very near to such people, and to think a great deal about their\r\ntroubles. Gradually his glance gathered a more definite expression, and\r\nat last he said with abrupt emphasis\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you would have been my daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe swift flush came in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face and went back again as swiftly,\r\nleaving her with white lips a little apart, like a marble image of\r\nhorror. For her mind, the revelation was made. She divined the facts\r\nthat lay behind that single word, and in the first moment there could\r\nbe no check to the impulsive belief which sprang from her keen\r\nexperience of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s nature. The sensitive response of her face was a\r\nstimulus to Baldassarre; for the first time his words had wrought their\r\nright effect. He went on with gathering eagerness and firmness, laying\r\nhis hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a woman of proud blood\xe2\x80\x94is it not true? You go to hear the\r\npreacher; you hate baseness\xe2\x80\x94baseness that smiles and triumphs. You hate\r\nyour husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God! were you really his father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in a low voice, too\r\nentirely possessed by the images of the past to take any note of\r\nBaldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xe2\x80\x9cOr was it as he said? Did you take him when he\r\nwas little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you believe me\xe2\x80\x94you know what he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, exultingly,\r\ntightening the pressure on her arm, as if the contact gave him power.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, not interpreting the words as he meant them. She\r\nlaid her palm gently on the rough hand that grasped her arm, and the\r\ntears came to her eyes as she looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is piteous! Tell\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94you were a great scholar; you taught him. How is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke off. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s allegation of this man\xe2\x80\x99s madness had come across\r\nher; and where were the signs even of past refinement? But she had the\r\nself-command not to move her hand. She sat perfectly still, waiting to\r\nlisten with new caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is gone!\xe2\x80\x94it is all gone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre; \xe2\x80\x9cand they would not\r\nbelieve me, because he lied, and said I was mad; and they had me\r\ndragged to prison. And I am old\xe2\x80\x94my mind will not come back. And the\r\nworld is against me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and his eyes sank as if he were under a wave of\r\ndespondency. Then he looked up at her again, and said with renewed\r\neagerness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut _you_ are not against me. He made you love him, and he\r\nhas been false to you; and you hate him. Yes, he made _me_ love him: he\r\nwas beautiful and gentle, and I was a lonely man. I took him when they\r\nwere beating him. He slept in my bosom when he was little, and I\r\nwatched him as he grew, and gave him all my knowledge, and everything\r\nthat was mine I meant to be his. I had many things; money, and books,\r\nand gems. He had my gems\xe2\x80\x94he sold them; and he left me in slavery. He\r\nnever came to seek me, and when I came back poor and in misery, he\r\ndenied me. He said I was a madman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told us his father was dead\xe2\x80\x94was drowned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, faintly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely he must have believed it then. Oh! he could not have been so\r\nbase _then_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA vision had risen of what Tito was to her in those first days when she\r\nthought no more of wrong in him than a child thinks of poison in\r\nflowers. The yearning regret that lay in that memory brought some\r\nrelief from the tension of horror. With one great sob the tears rushed\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are young, and the tears come easily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, with\r\nsome impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tears are no good; they only put out the fire\r\nwithin, and it is the fire that works. Tears will hinder us. Listen to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola turned towards him with a slight start. Again the possibility of\r\nhis madness had darted through her mind, and checked the rush of\r\nbelief. If, after all, this man were only a mad assassin? But her deep\r\nbelief in this story still lay behind, and it was more in sympathy than\r\nin fear that she avoided the risk of paining him by any show of doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as gently as she could, \xe2\x80\x9chow did you lose your\r\nmemory\xe2\x80\x94your scholarship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was ill. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell how long\xe2\x80\x94it was a blank. I remember nothing,\r\nonly at last I was sitting in the sun among the stones, and everything\r\nelse was darkness. And slowly, and by degrees, I felt something besides\r\nthat: a longing for something\xe2\x80\x94I did not know what\xe2\x80\x94that never came. And\r\nwhen I was in the ship on the waters I began to know what I longed for;\r\nit was for the Boy to come back\xe2\x80\x94it was to find all my thoughts again,\r\nfor I was locked away outside them all. And I am outside now. I feel\r\nnothing but a wall and darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldassarre had become dreamy again, and sank into silence, resting his\r\nhead between his hands; and again Romola\xe2\x80\x99s belief in him had submerged\r\nall cautioning doubts. The pity with which she dwelt on his words\r\nseemed like the revival of an old pang. Had she not daily seen how her\r\nfather missed Dino and the future he had dreamed of in that son?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all came back once,\xe2\x80\x9d Baldassarre went on presently. \xe2\x80\x9cI was master\r\nof everything. I saw all the world again, and my gems, and my books;\r\nand I thought I had him in my power, and I went to expose him\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x94where the lights were and the trees; and he lied again, and said\r\nI was mad, and they dragged me away to prison... Wickedness is strong;\r\nand he wears armour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fierceness had flamed up again. He spoke with his former intensity,\r\nand again he grasped Romola\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will help me? He has been false to you too. He has another\r\nwife, and she has children. He makes her believe he is her husband, and\r\nshe is a foolish, helpless thing. I will show you where she lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first shock that passed through Romola was visibly one of anger.\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s sense of indignity was inevitably foremost. Baldassarre\r\ninstinctively felt her in sympathy with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hate him,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true? There is no love between\r\nyou; I know that. I know women can hate; and you have proud blood. You\r\nhate falseness, and you can love revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola sat paralysed by the shock of conflicting feelings. She was not\r\nconscious of the grasp that was bruising her tender arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall contrive it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, presently, in an eager\r\nwhisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI have learned by heart that you are his rightful wife. You\r\nare a noble woman. You go to hear the preacher of vengeance; you will\r\nhelp justice. But you will think for me. My mind goes\xe2\x80\x94everything goes\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94all but the fire. The fire is God: it is justice: it will not\r\ndie. You believe that\xe2\x80\x94is it not true? If they will not hang him for\r\nrobbing me, you will take away his armour\xe2\x80\x94you will make him go without\r\nit, and I will stab him. I have a knife, and my arm is still strong\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his hand under his tunic, and reached out the hidden knife,\r\nfeeling the edge abstractedly, as if he needed the sensation to keep\r\nalive his ideas.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Romola as if every fresh hour of her life were to become\r\nmore difficult than the last. Her judgment was too vigorous and rapid\r\nfor her to fall into the mistake of using futile deprecatory words to a\r\nman in Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind. She chose not to answer his last\r\nspeech. She would win time for his excitement to allay itself by asking\r\nsomething else that she cared to know. She spoke rather tremulously\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say she is foolish and helpless\xe2\x80\x94that other wife\xe2\x80\x94and believes him\r\nto be her real husband. Perhaps he is: perhaps he married her before he\r\nmarried me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, pausing in that action of feeling\r\nthe knife, and looking bewildered. \xe2\x80\x9cI can remember no more. I only know\r\nwhere she lives. You shall see her. I will take you; but not now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9c_he_ may be there. The night is coming on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, starting up with a sudden consciousness that\r\nthe sun had set and the hills were darkening; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you will come and\r\ntake me\xe2\x80\x94when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, dreaming that she, too, wanted to\r\nhurry to her vengeance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to me, then, where you came to me to-day, in the church. I will\r\nbe there at ten; and if you are not there, I will go again towards\r\nmid-day. Can you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMid-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly mid-day. The same place, and mid-day.\r\nAnd, after that,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, rising and grasping her arm again with his\r\nleft hand, while he held the knife in his right; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will have our\r\nrevenge. He shall feel the sharp edge of justice. The world is against\r\nme, but you will help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would help you in other ways,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, making a first, timid\r\neffort to dispel his illusion about her. \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you are in want; you\r\nhave to labour, and get little. I should like to bring you comforts,\r\nand make you feel again that there is some one who cares for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk no more about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baldassarre, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cI will have\r\nnothing else. Help me to wring one drop of vengeance on this side of\r\nthe grave. I have nothing but my knife. It is sharp; but there is a\r\nmoment after the thrust when men see the face of death,\xe2\x80\x94and it shall be\r\nmy face that he will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe loosed his hold, and sank down again in a sitting posture. Romola\r\nfelt helpless: she must defer all intentions till the morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMid-day, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a distinct voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with an air of exhaustion. \xe2\x80\x9cGo; I will rest here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hastened away. Turning at the last spot whence he was likely to be\r\nin sight, she saw him seated still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\nThe Evening and the Morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomola had a purpose in her mind as she was hastening away; a purpose\r\nwhich had been growing through the afternoon hours like a side-stream,\r\nrising higher and higher along with the main current. It was less a\r\nresolve than a necessity of her feeling. Heedless of the darkening\r\nstreets, and not caring to call for Maso\xe2\x80\x99s slow escort, she hurried\r\nacross the bridge where the river showed itself black before the\r\ndistant dying red, and took the most direct way to the Old Palace. She\r\nmight encounter her husband there. No matter. She could not weigh\r\nprobabilities; she must discharge her heart. She did not know what she\r\npassed in the pillared court or up the wide stairs; she only knew that\r\nshe asked an usher for the Gonfaloniere, giving her name, and begging\r\nto be shown into a private room.\r\n\r\nShe was not left long alone with the frescoed figures and the newly-lit\r\ntapers. Soon the door opened, and Bernardo del Nero entered, still\r\ncarrying his white head erect above his silk lucco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomola, my child, what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of anxious\r\nsurprise as he closed the door.\r\n\r\nShe had uncovered her head and went towards him without speaking. He\r\nlaid his hand on her shoulder, and held her a little way from him that\r\nhe might see her better. Her face was haggard from fatigue and long\r\nagitation, her hair had rolled down in disorder; but there was an\r\nexcitement in her eyes that seemed to have triumphed over the bodily\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he done?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me everything,\r\nchild; throw away pride. I am your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not about myself\xe2\x80\x94nothing about myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, hastily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest godfather, it is about you. I have heard things\xe2\x80\x94some I cannot\r\ntell you. But you are in danger in the palace; you are in danger\r\neverywhere. There are fanatical men who would harm you, and\xe2\x80\x94and there\r\nare traitors. Trust nobody. If you trust, you will be betrayed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBernardo smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you worked yourself up into this agitation, my poor child,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, raising his hand to her head and patting it gently, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell such\r\nold truth as that to an old man like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no! they are not old truths that I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, pressing\r\nher clasped hands painfully together, as if that action would help her\r\nto suppress what must not be told. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are fresh things that I know,\r\nbut cannot tell. Dearest godfather, you know I am not foolish. I would\r\nnot come to you without reason. Is it too late to warn you against any\r\none, _every_ one who seems to be working on your side? Is it too late\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x98Go to your villa and keep away in the country when these three\r\nmore days of office are over?\xe2\x80\x99 Oh God! perhaps it is too late! and if\r\nany harm comes to you, it will be as if I had done it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last words had burst from Romola involuntarily: a long-stifled\r\nfeeling had found spasmodic utterance. But she herself was startled and\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing positive. I only\r\nknow what fills me with fears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, looking at her with quiet penetration for\r\na moment or two. Then he said: \xe2\x80\x9cGo, Romola\xe2\x80\x94go home and rest. These\r\nfears may be only big ugly shadows of something very little and\r\nharmless. Even traitors must see their interest in betraying; the rats\r\nwill run where they smell the cheese, and there is no knowing yet which\r\nway the scent will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and turned away his eyes from her with an air of\r\nabstraction, till, with a slow shrug, he added\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for warnings, they are of no use to me, child. I enter into no\r\nplots, but I never forsake my colours. If I march abreast with\r\nobstinate men, who will rush on guns and pikes, I must share the\r\nconsequences. Let us say no more about that. I have not many years left\r\nat the bottom of my sack for them to rob me of. Go, child; go home and\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his hand on her head again caressingly, and she could not help\r\nclinging to his arm, and pressing her brow against his shoulder. Her\r\ngodfather\xe2\x80\x99s caress seemed the last thing that was left to her out of\r\nthat young filial life, which now looked so happy to her even in its\r\ntroubles, for they were troubles untainted by anything hateful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs silence best, my Romola?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, now; but I cannot tell whether it always will be,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered,\r\nhesitatingly, raising her head with an appealing look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have a father\xe2\x80\x99s ear while I am above ground,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he lifted the\r\nblack drapery and folded it round her head, adding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand a father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhome; remember that.\xe2\x80\x9d Then opening the door, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, hasten\r\naway. You are like a black ghost; you will be safe enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Romola fell asleep that night, she slept deep. Agitation had\r\nreached its limits; she must gather strength before she could suffer\r\nmore; and, in spite of rigid habit, she slept on far beyond sunrise.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke, it was to the sound of guns. Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, with\r\nthirteen hundred men at his back, was before the gate that looks\r\ntowards Rome.\r\n\r\nSo much Romola learned from Maso, with many circumstantial additions of\r\ndubious quality. A countryman had come in and alarmed the Signoria\r\nbefore it was light, else the city would have been taken by surprise.\r\nHis master was not in the house, having been summoned to the Palazzo\r\nlong ago. She sent out the old man again, that he might gather news,\r\nwhile she went up to the loggia from time to time to try and discern\r\nany signs of the dreaded entrance having been made, or of its having\r\nbeen effectively repelled. Maso brought her word that the great Piazza\r\nwas full of armed men, and that many of the chief citizens suspected as\r\nfriends of the Medici had been summoned to the palace and detained\r\nthere. Some of the people seemed not to mind whether Piero got in or\r\nnot, and some said the Signoria itself had invited him; but however\r\nthat might be, they were giving him an ugly welcome; and the soldiers\r\nfrom Pisa were coming against him.\r\n\r\nIn her memory of those morning hours, there were not many things that\r\nRomola could distinguish as actual external experiences standing\r\nmarkedly out above the tumultuous waves of retrospect and anticipation.\r\nShe knew that she had really walked to the Badia by the appointed time\r\nin spite of street alarms; she knew that she had waited there in vain.\r\nAnd the scene she had witnessed when she came out of the church, and\r\nstood watching on the steps while the doors were being closed behind\r\nher for the afternoon interval, always came back to her like a\r\nremembered waking.\r\n\r\nThere was a change in the faces and tones of the people, armed and\r\nunarmed, who were pausing or hurrying along the streets. The guns were\r\nfiring again, but the sound only provoked laughter. She soon knew the\r\ncause of the change. Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici and his horsemen had turned their\r\nbacks on Florence, and were galloping as fast as they could along the\r\nSiena road. She learned this from a substantial shop-keeping Piagnone,\r\nwho had not yet laid down his pike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended, with a certain bitterness in his emphasis.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPiero is gone, but there are those left behind who were in the secret\r\nof his coming\xe2\x80\x94we all know that; and if the new Signoria does its duty\r\nwe shall soon know who they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words darted through Romola like a sharp spasm; but the evil they\r\nforeshadowed was not yet close upon her, and as she entered her home\r\nagain, her most pressing anxiety was the possibility that she had lost\r\nsight for a long while of Baldassarre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\nWaiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola\r\nmost desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from\r\nBaldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the\r\nGovernment, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought\r\nother things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded\r\nspace of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought\r\nthe spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola.\r\n\r\nBoth these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the\r\nFrate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to\r\nher the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight\r\nfor principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day\r\nto day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement\r\nof a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make\r\nsome of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this\r\ntranscendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the\r\nsilencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great\r\nmass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his\r\nsuperstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the\r\nChristian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nFar on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks\r\narrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to\r\nwitness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate\r\nthat sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It\r\nwas in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to\r\nwitness there.\r\n\r\nInstead of upturned citizen-faces filling the vast area under the\r\nmorning light, the youngest rising amphitheatre-wise towards the walls,\r\nand making a garland of hope around the memories of age\xe2\x80\x94instead of the\r\nmighty voice thrilling all hearts with the sense of great things,\r\nvisible and invisible, to be struggled for\xe2\x80\x94there were the bare walls at\r\nevening made more sombre by the glimmer of tapers; there was the black\r\nand grey flock of monks and secular clergy with bent, unexpectant\r\nfaces; there was the occasional tinkling of little bells in the pauses\r\nof a monotonous voice reading a sentence which had already been long\r\nhanging up in the churches; and at last there was the extinction of the\r\ntapers, and the slow, shuffling tread of monkish feet departing in the\r\ndim silence.\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s ardour on the side of the Frate was doubly strengthened by the\r\ngleeful triumph she saw in hard and coarse faces, and by the\r\nfear-stricken confusion in the faces and speech of many among his\r\nstrongly-attached friends. The question where the duty of obedience\r\nends, and the duty of resistance begins, could in no case be an easy\r\none; but it was made overwhelmingly difficult by the belief that the\r\nChurch was\xe2\x80\x94not a compromise of parties to secure a more or less\r\napproximate justice in the appropriation of funds, but\xe2\x80\x94a living\r\norganism, instinct with Divine power to bless and to curse. To most of\r\nthe pious Florentines, who had hitherto felt no doubt in their\r\nadherence to the Frate, that belief in the Divine potency of the Church\r\nwas not an embraced opinion, it was an inalienable impression, like the\r\nconcavity of the blue firmament; and the boldness of Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwritten arguments that the Excommunication was unjust, and that, being\r\nunjust, it was not valid, only made them tremble the more, as a\r\ndefiance cast at a mystic image, against whose subtle immeasurable\r\npower there was neither weapon nor defence.\r\n\r\nBut Romola, whose mind had not been allowed to draw its early\r\nnourishment from the traditional associations of the Christian\r\ncommunity in which her father had lived a life apart, felt her relation\r\nto the Church only through Savonarola; his moral force had been the\r\nonly authority to which she had bowed; and in his excommunication she\r\nonly saw the menace of hostile vice: on one side she saw a man whose\r\nlife was devoted to the ends of public virtue and spiritual purity, and\r\non the other the assault of alarmed selfishness, headed by a lustful,\r\ngreedy, lying, and murderous old man, once called Rodrigo Borgia, and\r\nnow lifted to the pinnacle of infamy as Pope Alexander the Sixth. The\r\nfiner shades of fact which soften the edge of such antitheses are not\r\napt to be seen except by neutrals, who are not distressed to discern\r\nsome folly in martyrs and some judiciousness in the men who burnt them.\r\nBut Romola required a strength that neutrality could not give; and this\r\nExcommunication, which simplified and ennobled the resistant position\r\nof Savonarola by bringing into prominence its wider relations, seemed\r\nto come to her like a rescue from the threatening isolation of\r\ncriticism and doubt. The Frate was now withdrawn from that smaller\r\nantagonism against Florentine enemies into which he continually fell in\r\nthe unchecked excitement of the pulpit, and presented himself simply as\r\nappealing to the Christian world against a vicious exercise of\r\necclesiastical power. He was a standard-bearer leaping into the breach.\r\nLife never seems so clear and easy as when the heart is beating faster\r\nat the sight of some generous self-risking deed. We feel no doubt then\r\nwhat is the highest prize the soul can win; we almost believe in our\r\nown power to attain it. By a new current of such enthusiasm Romola was\r\nhelped through these difficult summer days. She had ventured on no\r\nwords to Tito that would apprise him of her late interview with\r\nBaldassarre, and the revelation he had made to her. What would such\r\nagitating, difficult words win from him? No admission of the truth;\r\nnothing, probably, but a cool sarcasm about her sympathy with his\r\nassassin. Baldassarre was evidently helpless: the thing to be feared\r\nwas, not that he should injure Tito, but that Tito, coming upon his\r\ntraces, should carry out some new scheme for ridding himself of the\r\ninjured man who was a haunting dread to him. Romola felt that she could\r\ndo nothing decisive until she had seen Baldassarre again, and learned\r\nthe full truth about that \xe2\x80\x9cother wife\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94learned whether she were the\r\nwife to whom Tito was first bound.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities about that other wife, which involved the worst wound\r\nto her hereditary pride, mingled themselves as a newly-embittering\r\nsuspicion with the earliest memories of her illusory love, eating away\r\nthe lingering associations of tenderness with the past image of her\r\nhusband; and her irresistible belief in the rest of Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrevelation made her shrink from Tito with a horror which would perhaps\r\nhave urged some passionate speech in spite of herself if he had not\r\nbeen more than usually absent from home. Like many of the wealthier\r\ncitizens in that time of pestilence, he spent the intervals of business\r\nchiefly in the country: the agreeable Melema was welcome at many\r\nvillas, and since Romola had refused to leave the city, he had no need\r\nto provide a country residence of his own.\r\n\r\nBut at last, in the later days of July, the alleviation of those public\r\ntroubles which had absorbed her activity and much of her thought, left\r\nRomola to a less counteracted sense of her personal lot. The Plague had\r\nalmost disappeared, and the position of Savonarola was made more\r\nhopeful by a favourable magistracy, who were writing urgent vindicatory\r\nletters to Rome on his behalf, entreating the withdrawal of the\r\nExcommunication.\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s healthy and vigorous frame was undergoing the reaction of\r\nlanguor inevitable after continuous excitement and over-exertion; but\r\nher mental restlessness would not allow her to remain at home without\r\nperemptory occupation, except during the sultry hours. In the cool of\r\nthe morning and evening she walked out constantly, varying her\r\ndirection as much as possible, with the vague hope that if Baldassarre\r\nwere still alive she might encounter him. Perhaps some illness had\r\nbrought a new paralysis of memory, and he had forgotten where she\r\nlived\xe2\x80\x94forgotten even her existence. That was her most sanguine\r\nexplanation of his non-appearance. The explanation she felt to be most\r\nprobable was, that he had died of the Plague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\nThe Other Wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning warmth was already beginning to be rather oppressive to\r\nRomola, when, after a walk along by the walls on her way from San\r\nMarco, she turned towards the intersecting streets again at the gate of\r\nSanta Croce.\r\n\r\nThe Borgo La Croce was so still, that she listened to her own footsteps\r\non the pavement in the sunny silence, until, on approaching a bend in\r\nthe street, she saw, a few yards before her, a little child not more\r\nthan three years old, with no other clothing than his white shirt,\r\npause from a waddling run and look around him. In the first moment of\r\ncoming nearer she could only see his back\xe2\x80\x94a boy\xe2\x80\x99s back, square and\r\nsturdy, with a cloud of reddish-brown curls above it; but in the next\r\nhe turned towards her, and she could see his dark eyes wide with tears,\r\nand his lower lip pushed up and trembling, while his fat brown fists\r\nclutched his shirt helplessly. The glimpse of a tall black figure\r\nsending a shadow over him brought his bewildered fear to a climax, and\r\na loud crying sob sent the big tears rolling.\r\n\r\nRomola, with the ready maternal instinct which was one hidden source of\r\nher passionate tenderness, instantly uncovered her head, and, stooping\r\ndown on the pavement, put her arms round him, and her cheeks against\r\nhis, while she spoke to him in caressing tones. At first his sobs were\r\nonly the louder, but he made no effort to get away, and presently the\r\noutburst ceased with that strange abruptness which belongs to childish\r\njoys and griefs: his face lost its distortion, and was fixed in an\r\nopen-mouthed gaze at Romola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have lost yourself, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, kissing him. \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nmind! we will find the house again. Perhaps mamma will meet us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe divined that he had made his escape at a moment when the mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes were turned away from him, and thought it likely that he would\r\nsoon be followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a heavy, heavy boy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trying to lift him. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\ncarry you. Come, then, you must toddle back by my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe parted lips remained motionless in awed silence, and one brown fist\r\nstill clutched the shirt with as much tenacity as ever; but the other\r\nyielded itself quite willingly to the wonderful white hand, strong but\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_ a mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, as they set out, looking down at the\r\nboy with a certain yearning. But he was mute. A girl under those\r\ncircumstances might perhaps have chirped abundantly; not so this\r\nsquare-shouldered little man with the big cloud of curls.\r\n\r\nHe was awake to the first sign of his whereabout, however. At the\r\nturning by the front of San Ambrogio he dragged Romola towards it,\r\nlooking up at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is the way home, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling at him. He only\r\nthrust his head forward and pulled, as an admonition that they should\r\ngo faster.\r\n\r\nThere was still another turning that he had a decided opinion about,\r\nand then Romola found herself in a short street leading to open garden\r\nground. It was in front of a house at the end of this street that the\r\nlittle fellow paused, pulling her towards some stone stairs. He had\r\nevidently no wish for her to loose his hand, and she would not have\r\nbeen willing to leave him without being sure that she was delivering\r\nhim to his friends. They mounted the stairs, seeing but dimly in that\r\nsudden withdrawal from the sunlight, till, at the final landing-place,\r\nan extra stream of light came from an open doorway. Passing through a\r\nsmall lobby, they came to another open door, and there Romola paused.\r\nHer approach had not been heard.\r\n\r\nOn a low chair at the farther end of the room, opposite the light, sat\r\nTessa, with one hand on the edge of the cradle, and her head hanging a\r\nlittle on one side, fast asleep. Near one of the windows, with her back\r\nturned towards the door, sat Monna Lisa at her work of preparing salad,\r\nin deaf unconsciousness. There was only an instant for Romola\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to\r\ntake in that still scene; for Lillo snatched his hand away from her and\r\nran up to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, not making any direct effort to wake her,\r\nbut only leaning his head back against her arm, and surveying Romola\r\nseriously from that distance.\r\n\r\nAs Lillo pushed against her, Tessa opened her eyes, and looked up in\r\nbewilderment; but her glance had no sooner rested on the figure at the\r\nopposite doorway than she started up, blushed deeply, and began to\r\ntremble a little, neither speaking nor moving forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! we have seen each other before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, smiling, and coming\r\nforward. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad it was _your_ little boy. He was crying in the\r\nstreet; I suppose he had run away. So we walked together a little way,\r\nand then he knew where he was, and brought me here. But you had not\r\nmissed him? That is well, else you would have been frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shock of finding that Lillo had run away overcame every other\r\nfeeling in Tessa for the moment. Her colour went again, and, seizing\r\nLillo\xe2\x80\x99s arm, she ran with him to Monna Lisa, saying, with a half sob,\r\nloud in the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s ear\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lisa, you are wicked! Why will you stand with your back to the\r\ndoor? Lillo ran away ever so far into the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Monna Lisa, in her meek, thick tone, letting the\r\nspoon fall from her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere were _you_, then? I thought you were\r\nthere, and had your eye on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you _know_ I go to sleep when I am rocking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, in\r\npettish remonstrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, we must keep the outer door shut, or else tie him up,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Monna Lisa, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he\xe2\x80\x99ll be as cunning as Satan before long, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the holy truth. But how came he back, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question recalled Tessa to the consciousness of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\nWithout answering, she turned towards her, blushing and timid again,\r\nand Monna Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed her movement. The old woman made a low\r\nreverence, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless the most noble lady brought him back.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, advancing a\r\nlittle nearer to Romola, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my shame for him to have been\r\nfound with only his shirt on; but he kicked, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have his\r\nother clothes on this morning, and the mother, poor thing, will never\r\nhear of his being beaten. But what\xe2\x80\x99s an old woman to do without a stick\r\nwhen the lad\xe2\x80\x99s legs get so strong? Let your nobleness look at his\r\nlegs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLillo, conscious that his legs were in question, pulled his shirt up a\r\nlittle higher, and looked down at their olive roundness with a\r\ndispassionate and curious air. Romola laughed, and stooped to give him\r\na caressing shake and a kiss, and this action helped the reassurance\r\nthat Tessa had already gathered from Monna Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s address to Romola.\r\nFor when Naldo had been told about the adventure at the Carnival, and\r\nTessa had asked him who the heavenly lady that had come just when she\r\nwas wanted, and had vanished so soon, was likely to be\xe2\x80\x94whether she\r\ncould be the Holy Madonna herself?\xe2\x80\x94he had answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly, my\r\nTessa; only one of the saints,\xe2\x80\x9d and had not chosen to say more. So that\r\nin the dreamlike combination of small experience which made up Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthought, Romola had remained confusedly associated with the pictures in\r\nthe churches, and when she reappeared, the grateful remembrance of her\r\nprotection was slightly tinctured with religious awe\xe2\x80\x94not deeply, for\r\nTessa\xe2\x80\x99s dread was chiefly of ugly and evil beings. It seemed unlikely\r\nthat good beings would be angry and punish her, as it was the nature of\r\nNofri and the devil to do. And now that Monna Lisa had spoken freely\r\nabout Lillo\xe2\x80\x99s legs and Romola had laughed, Tessa was more at her ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNinna\xe2\x80\x99s in the cradle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9c_She\xe2\x80\x99s_ pretty too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola went to look at the sleeping Ninna, and Monna Lisa, one of the\r\nexceptionally meek deaf, who never expect to be spoken to, returned to\r\nher salad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! she is waking: she has opened her blue eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust take her up, and I will sit down in this chair\xe2\x80\x94may I?\xe2\x80\x94and nurse\r\nLillo. Come, Lillo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down in Tito\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and put out her arms towards the lad,\r\nwhose eyes had followed her. He hesitated: and, pointing his small\r\nfingers at her with a half-puzzled, half-angry feeling, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBabbo\xe2\x80\x99s chair,\xe2\x80\x9d not seeing his way out of the difficulty if Babbo came\r\nand found Romola in his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Babbo is not here, and I shall go soon. Come, let me nurse you as\r\nhe does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, wondering to herself for the first time what\r\nsort of Babbo he was whose wife was dressed in contadina fashion, but\r\nhad a certain daintiness about her person that indicated idleness and\r\nplenty. Lillo consented to be lifted up, and, finding the lap\r\nexceedingly comfortable, began to explore her dress and hands, to see\r\nif there were any ornaments beside the rosary.\r\n\r\nTessa, who had hitherto been occupied in coaxing Ninna out of her\r\nwaking peevishness, now sat down in her low chair, near Romola\xe2\x80\x99s knee,\r\narranging Ninna\xe2\x80\x99s tiny person to advantage, jealous that the strange\r\nlady too seemed to notice the boy most, as Naldo did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLillo was going to be angry with me, because I sat in Babbo\xe2\x80\x99s chair,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Romola, as she bent forward to kiss Ninna\xe2\x80\x99s little foot. \xe2\x80\x9cWill he\r\ncome soon and want it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can sit in it a long while. I shall be sorry\r\nwhen you go. When you first came to take care of me at the Carnival, I\r\nthought it was wonderful; you came and went away again so fast. And\r\nNaldo said, perhaps you were a saint, and that made me tremble a\r\nlittle, though the saints are very good, I know; and you were good to\r\nme, and now you have taken care of Lillo. Perhaps you will always come\r\nand take care of me. That was how Naldo did a long while ago; he came\r\nand took care of me when I was frightened, one San Giovanni. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink where he came from\xe2\x80\x94he was so beautiful and good. And so are you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nended Tessa, looking up at Romola with devout admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaldo is your husband. His eyes are like Lillo\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nlooking at the boy\xe2\x80\x99s darkly-pencilled eyebrows, unusual at his age. She\r\ndid not speak interrogatively, but with a quiet certainty of inference\r\nwhich was necessarily mysterious to Tessa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you know him!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pausing a little in wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\r\nknow Nofri and Peretola, and our house on the hill, and everything.\r\nYes, like Lillo\xe2\x80\x99s; but not his hair. His hair is dark and long\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on, getting rather excited. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! if you know it, ecco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had put her hand to a thin red silk cord that hung round her neck,\r\nand drew from her bosom the tiny old parchment _Breve_, the horn of red\r\ncoral, and a long dark curl carefully tied at one end and suspended\r\nwith those mystic treasures. She held them towards Romola, away from\r\nNinna\xe2\x80\x99s snatching hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fresh one. I cut it lately. See how bright it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nlaying it against the white background of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cThey get\r\ndim, and then he lets me cut another when his hair is grown; and I put\r\nit with the _Breve_, because sometimes he is away a long while, and\r\nthen I think it helps to take care of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight shiver passed through Romola as the curl was laid across her\r\nfingers. At Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s first mention of her husband as having come\r\nmysteriously she knew not whence, a possibility had risen before Romola\r\nthat made her heart beat faster; for to one who is anxiously in search\r\nof a certain object the faintest suggestions have a peculiar\r\nsignificance. And when the curl was held towards her, it seemed for an\r\ninstant like a mocking phantasm of the lock she herself had cut to wind\r\nwith one of her own five years ago. But she preserved her outward\r\ncalmness, bent not only on knowing the truth, but also on coming to\r\nthat knowledge in a way that would not pain this poor, trusting,\r\nignorant thing, with the child\xe2\x80\x99s mind in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s body. \xe2\x80\x9cFoolish and\r\nhelpless:\xe2\x80\x9d yes; so far she corresponded to Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a beautiful curl,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, resisting the impulse to withdraw\r\nher hand. \xe2\x80\x9cLillo\xe2\x80\x99s curls will be like it, perhaps, for _his_ cheek,\r\ntoo, is dark. And you never know where your husband goes to when he\r\nleaves you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, putting back her treasures out of the children\xe2\x80\x99s way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know Messer San Michele takes care of him, for he gave him a\r\nbeautiful coat, all made of little chains; and if he puts that on,\r\nnobody can kill him. And perhaps, if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa hesitated a little, under a recurrence of that original dreamy\r\nwonder about Romola which had been expelled by chatting contact\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\n_were_ a saint, you would take care of him, too, because you have taken\r\ncare of me and Lillo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn agitated flush came over Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face in the first moment of\r\ncertainty, but she had bent her cheek against Lillo\xe2\x80\x99s head. The feeling\r\nthat leaped out in that flush was something like exultation at the\r\nthought that the wife\xe2\x80\x99s burden might be about to slip from her\r\noverladen shoulders; that this little ignorant creature might prove to\r\nbe Tito\xe2\x80\x99s lawful wife. A strange exultation for a proud and high-born\r\nwoman to have been brought to! But it seemed to Romola as if that were\r\nthe only issue that would make duty anything else for her than an\r\ninsoluble problem. Yet she was not deaf to Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s last appealing\r\nwords; she raised her head, and said, in her clearest tones\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will always take care of you if I see you need me. But that\r\nbeautiful coat? your husband did not wear it when you were first\r\nmarried? Perhaps he used not to be so long away from you then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes! he was. Much\xe2\x80\x94much longer. So long, I thought he would never\r\ncome back. I used to cry. Oh me! I was beaten then; a long, long while\r\nago at Peretola, where we had the goats and mules.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long had you been married before your husband had that\r\nchain-coat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, her heart beating faster and faster.\r\n\r\nTessa looked meditative, and began to count on her fingers, and Romola\r\nwatched the fingers as if they would tell the secret of her destiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chestnuts were ripe when we were married,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, marking off\r\nher thumb and fingers again as she spoke; \xe2\x80\x9cand then again they were\r\nripe at Peretola before he came back, and then again, after that, on\r\nthe hill. And soon the soldiers came, and we heard the trumpets, and\r\nthen Naldo had the coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had been married more than two years. In which church were you\r\nmarried?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, too entirely absorbed by one thought to put any\r\nquestion that was less direct. Perhaps before the next morning she\r\nmight go to her godfather and say that she was not Tito Melema\xe2\x80\x99s lawful\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94that the vows which had bound her to strive after an impossible\r\nunion had been made void beforehand.\r\n\r\nTessa gave a slight start at Romola\xe2\x80\x99s new tone of inquiry, and looked\r\nup at her with a hesitating expression. Hitherto she had prattled on\r\nwithout consciousness that she was making revelations, any more than\r\nwhen she said old things over and over again to Monna Lisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaldo said I was never to tell about that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou think he would not be angry if I told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is right that you should tell me. Tell me everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nlooking at her with mild authority.\r\n\r\nIf the impression from Naldo\xe2\x80\x99s command had been much more recent than\r\nit was, the constraining effect of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious authority would\r\nhave overcome it. But the sense that she was telling what she had never\r\ntold before made her begin with a lowered voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not in a church\xe2\x80\x94it was at the Nativita, when there was a fair,\r\nand all the people went overnight to see the Madonna in the Nunziata,\r\nand my mother was ill and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go, and I took the bunch of cocoons\r\nfor her; and then he came to me in the church and I heard him say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tessa!\xe2\x80\x99 I knew him because he had taken care of me at the San\r\nGiovanni, and then we went into the piazza where the fair was, and I\r\nhad some _berlingozzi_, for I was hungry and he was very good to me;\r\nand at the end of the piazza there was a holy father, and an altar like\r\nwhat they have at the processions outside the churches. So he married\r\nus, and then Naldo took me back into the church and left me; and I went\r\nhome, and my mother died, and Nofri began to beat me more, and Naldo\r\nnever came back. And I used to cry, and once at the Carnival I saw him\r\nand followed him, and he was angry, and said he would come some time, I\r\nmust wait. So I went and waited; but, oh! it was a long while before he\r\ncame; but he would have come if he could, for he was good; and then he\r\ntook me away, because I cried and said I could not bear to stay with\r\nNofri. And, oh! I was so glad, and since then I have been always happy,\r\nfor I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind about the goats and mules, because I have Lillo and\r\nNinna now; and Naldo is never angry, only I think he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love Ninna\r\nso well as Lillo, and she _is_ pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite forgetting that she had thought her speech rather momentous at\r\nthe beginning, Tessa fell to devouring Ninna with kisses, while Romola\r\nsat in silence with absent eyes. It was inevitable that in this moment\r\nshe should think of the three beings before her chiefly in their\r\nrelation to her own lot, and she was feeling the chill of\r\ndisappointment that her difficulties were not to be solved by external\r\nlaw. She had relaxed her hold of Lillo, and was leaning her cheek\r\nagainst her hand, seeing nothing of the scene around her. Lillo was\r\nquick in perceiving a change that was not agreeable to him; he had not\r\nyet made any return to her caresses, but he objected to their\r\nwithdrawal, and putting up both his brown arms to pull her head towards\r\nhim, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cPlay with me again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola, roused from her self-absorption, clasped the lad anew, and\r\nlooked from him to Tessa, who had now paused from her shower of kisses,\r\nand seemed to have returned to the more placid delight of contemplating\r\nthe heavenly lady\xe2\x80\x99s face. That face was undergoing a subtle change,\r\nlike the gradual oncoming of a warmer, softer light. Presently Romola\r\ntook her scissors from her scarsella, and cut off one of her long wavy\r\nlocks, while the three pair of wide eyes followed her movements with\r\nkitten-like observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go away from you now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will leave this lock of\r\nhair that it may remind you of me, because if you are ever in trouble\r\nyou can think that perhaps God will send me to take care of you again.\r\nI cannot tell you where to find me, but if I ever know that you want\r\nme, I will come to you. Addio!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had set down Lillo hurriedly, and held out her hand to Tessa, who\r\nkissed it with a mixture of awe and sorrow at this parting. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind was oppressed with thoughts; she needed to be alone as soon as\r\npossible, but with her habitual care for the least fortunate, she\r\nturned aside to put her hand in a friendly way on Monna Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder\r\nand make her a farewell sign. Before the old woman had finished her\r\ndeep reverence, Romola had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMonna Lisa and Tessa moved towards each other by simultaneous impulses,\r\nwhile the two children stood clinging to their mother\xe2\x80\x99s skirts as if\r\nthey, too, felt the atmosphere of awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she _was_ a saint?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tessa, in Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s ear, showing\r\nher the lock.\r\n\r\nLisa rejected that notion very decidedly by a backward movement of her\r\nfingers, and then stroking the rippled gold, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a great and noble lady. I saw such in my youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola went home and sat alone through the sultry hours of that day\r\nwith the heavy certainty that her lot was unchanged. She was thrown\r\nback again on the conflict between the demands of an outward law, which\r\nshe recognised as a widely-ramifying obligation, and the demands of\r\ninner moral facts which were becoming more and more peremptory. She had\r\ndrunk in deeply the spirit of that teaching by which Savonarola had\r\nurged her to return to her place. She felt that the sanctity attached\r\nto all close relations, and, therefore, pre-eminently to the closest,\r\nwas but the expression in outward law of that result towards which all\r\nhuman goodness and nobleness must spontaneously tend; that the light\r\nabandonment of ties, whether inherited or voluntary, because they had\r\nceased to be pleasant, was the uprooting of social and personal virtue.\r\nWhat else had Tito\xe2\x80\x99s crime towards Baldassarre been but that\r\nabandonment working itself out to the most hideous extreme of falsity\r\nand ingratitude?\r\n\r\nAnd the inspiring consciousness breathed into her by Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence that her lot was vitally united with the general lot had\r\nexalted even the minor details of obligation into religion. She was\r\nmarching with a great army; she was feeling the stress of a common\r\nlife. If victims were needed, and it was uncertain on whom the lot\r\nmight fall, she would stand ready to answer to her name. She had stood\r\nlong; she had striven hard to fulfil the bond, but she had seen all the\r\nconditions which made the fulfilment possible gradually forsaking her.\r\nThe one effect of her marriage-tie seemed to be the stifling\r\npredominance over her of a nature that she despised. All her efforts at\r\nunion had only made its impossibility more palpable, and the relation\r\nhad become for her simply a degrading servitude. The law was sacred.\r\nYes, but rebellion might be sacred too. It flashed upon her mind that\r\nthe problem before her was essentially the same as that which had lain\r\nbefore Savonarola\xe2\x80\x94the problem where the sacredness of obedience ended,\r\nand where the sacredness of rebellion began. To her, as to him, there\r\nhad come one of those moments in life when the soul must dare to act on\r\nits own warrant, not only without external law to appeal to, but in the\r\nface of a law which is not unarmed with Divine lightnings\xe2\x80\x94lightnings\r\nthat may yet fall if the warrant has been false.\r\n\r\nBefore the sun had gone down she had adopted a resolve. She would ask\r\nno counsel of her godfather or of Savonarola until she had made one\r\ndetermined effort to speak freely with Tito and obtain his consent that\r\nshe should live apart from him. She desired not to leave him\r\nclandestinely again, or to forsake Florence. She would tell him that if\r\nhe ever felt a real need of her, she would come back to him. Was not\r\nthat the utmost faithfulness to her bond that could be required of her?\r\nA shuddering anticipation came over her that he would clothe a refusal\r\nin a sneering suggestion that she should enter a convent as the only\r\nmode of quitting him that would not be scandalous. He knew well that\r\nher mind revolted from that means of escape, not only because of her\r\nown repugnance to a narrow rule, but because all the cherished memories\r\nof her father forbade that she should adopt a mode of life which was\r\nassociated with his deepest griefs and his bitterest dislike.\r\n\r\nTito had announced his intention of coming home this evening. She would\r\nwait for him, and say what she had to say at once, for it was difficult\r\nto get his ear during the day. If he had the slightest suspicion that\r\npersonal words were coming, he slipped away with an appearance of\r\nunpremeditated ease. When she sent for Maso to tell him that she would\r\nwait for his master, she observed that the old man looked at her and\r\nlingered with a mixture of hesitation and wondering anxiety; but\r\nfinding that she asked him no question, he slowly turned away. Why\r\nshould she ask questions? Perhaps Maso only knew or guessed something\r\nof what she knew already.\r\n\r\nIt was late before Tito came. Romola had been pacing up and down the\r\nlong room which had once been the library, with the windows open, and a\r\nloose white linen robe on instead of her usual black garment. She was\r\nglad of that change after the long hours of heat and motionless\r\nmeditation; but the coolness and exercise made her more intensely\r\nwakeful, and as she went with the lamp in her hand to open the door for\r\nTito, he might well have been startled by the vividness of her eyes and\r\nthe expression of painful resolution, which was in contrast with her\r\nusual self-restrained quiescence before him. But it seemed that this\r\nexcitement was just what he expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is you, Romola. Maso is gone to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a grave,\r\nquiet tone, interposing to close the door for her. Then, turning round,\r\nhe said, looking at her more fully than he was wont, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard it\r\nall, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola quivered. _He_ then was inclined to take the initiative. He had\r\nbeen to Tessa. She led the way through the nearest door, set down her\r\nlamp, and turned towards him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not think despairingly of the consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, in a\r\ntone of soothing encouragement, at which Romola stood wondering, until\r\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe accused have too many family ties with all parties not\r\nto escape; and Messer Bernardo del Nero has other things in his favour\r\nbesides his age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola started, and gave a cry as if she had been suddenly stricken by\r\na sharp weapon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you did not know it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, putting his hand under her arm\r\nthat he might lead her to a seat; but she seemed to be unaware of his\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, hastily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctell me what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man, whose name you may forget\xe2\x80\x94Lamberto dell\xe2\x80\x99 Antella\xe2\x80\x94who was\r\nbanished, has been seized within the territory: a letter has been found\r\non him of very dangerous import to the chief Mediceans, and the\r\nscoundrel, who was once a favourite hound of Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, is ready\r\nnow to swear what any one pleases against him or his friends. Some have\r\nmade their escape, but five are now in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy godfather?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, scarcely above a whisper, as Tito made a\r\nslight pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: I grieve to say it. But along with him there are three, at least,\r\nwhose names have a commanding interest even among the popular\r\nparty\xe2\x80\x94Niccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and Giannozzo Pucci.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tide of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s feelings had been violently turned into a new\r\nchannel. In the tumult of that moment there could be no check to the\r\nwords which came as the impulsive utterance of her long-accumulating\r\nhorror. When Tito had named the men of whom she felt certain he was the\r\nconfederate, she said, with a recoiling gesture and low-toned\r\nbitterness\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _you_\xe2\x80\x94you are safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are certainly an amiable wife, my Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with the\r\ncoldest irony. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned away from each other in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\nWhy Tito was Safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTito had good reasons for saying that he was safe. In the last three\r\nmonths, during which he had foreseen the discovery of the Medicean\r\nconspirators as a probable event, he had had plenty of time to provide\r\nhimself with resources. He had been strengthening his influence at Rome\r\nand at Milan, by being the medium of secret information and indirect\r\nmeasures against the Frate and the popular party; he had cultivated\r\nmore assiduously than ever the regard of this party, by showing subtle\r\nevidence that his political convictions were entirely on their side;\r\nand all the while, instead of withdrawing his agency from the\r\nMediceans, he had sought to be more actively employed and exclusively\r\ntrusted by them. It was easy to him to keep up this triple game. The\r\nprinciple of duplicity admitted by the Mediceans on their own behalf\r\ndeprived them of any standard by which they could measure the\r\ntrustworthiness of a colleague who had not, like themselves, hereditary\r\ninterests, alliances, and prejudices, which were intensely Medicean. In\r\ntheir minds, to deceive the opposite party was fair stratagem; to\r\ndeceive their own party was a baseness to which they felt no\r\ntemptation; and, in using Tito\xe2\x80\x99s facile ability, they were not keenly\r\nawake to the fact that the absence of traditional attachments which\r\nmade him a convenient agent was also the absence of what among\r\nthemselves was the chief guarantee of mutual honour. Again, the Roman\r\nand Milanese friends of the aristocratic party, or Arrabbiati, who were\r\nthe bitterest enemies of Savonarola, carried on a system of underhand\r\ncorrespondence and espionage, in which the deepest hypocrisy was the\r\nbest service, and demanded the heaviest pay; so that to suspect an\r\nagent because he played a part strongly would have been an absurd want\r\nof logic. On the other hand, the Piagnoni of the popular party, who had\r\nthe directness that belongs to energetic conviction, were the more\r\ninclined to credit Tito with sincerity in his political adhesion to\r\nthem, because he affected no religious sympathies.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of these conditions, the last three months had been a time of\r\nflattering success to Tito. The result he most cared for was the\r\nsecuring of a future position for himself at Rome or at Milan; for he\r\nhad a growing determination, when the favourable moment should come, to\r\nquit Florence for one of those great capitals where life was easier,\r\nand the rewards of talent and learning were more splendid. At present,\r\nthe scale dipped in favour of Milan; and if within the year he could\r\nrender certain services to Duke Ludovico Sforza, he had the prospect of\r\na place at the Milanese court which outweighed the advantages of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe revelation of the Medicean conspiracy, then, had been a subject of\r\nforethought to Tito; but he had not been able to foresee the mode in\r\nwhich it would be brought about. The arrest of Lamberto dell\xe2\x80\x99 Antella\r\nwith a tell-tale letter on his person, and a bitter rancour against the\r\nMedici in his heart, was an incalculable event. It was not possible, in\r\nspite of the careful pretexts with which his agency had been guarded,\r\nthat Tito should escape implication: he had never expected this in case\r\nof any wide discovery concerning the Medicean plots. But his quick mind\r\nhad soon traced out the course that would secure his own safety with\r\nthe fewest unpleasant concomitants. It is agreeable to keep a whole\r\nskin; but the skin still remains an organ sensitive to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHis reckoning had not deceived him. That night, before he returned\r\nhome, he had secured the three results for which he most cared: he was\r\nto be freed from all proceedings against him on account of complicity\r\nwith the Mediceans; he was to retain his secretaryship for another\r\nyear, unless he previously resigned it; and, lastly, the price by which\r\nhe had obtained these guarantees was to be kept as a State secret. The\r\nprice would have been thought heavy by most men; and Tito himself would\r\nrather not have paid it.\r\n\r\nHe had applied himself first to win the mind of Francesco Valori, who\r\nwas not only one of the Ten under whom he immediately held his\r\nsecretaryship, but one of the special council appointed to investigate\r\nthe evidence of the plot. Francesco Valori, as we have seen, was the\r\nhead of the Piagnoni, a man with certain fine qualities that were not\r\nincompatible with violent partisanship, with an arrogant temper that\r\nalienated his friends, nor with bitter personal animosities\xe2\x80\x94one of the\r\nbitterest being directed against Bernardo del Nero. To him, in a brief\r\nprivate interview, after obtaining a pledge of secrecy, Tito avowed his\r\nown agency for the Mediceans\xe2\x80\x94an agency induced by motives about which\r\nhe was very frank, declaring at the same time that he had always\r\nbelieved their efforts futile, and that he sincerely preferred the\r\nmaintenance of the popular government; affected to confide to Valori,\r\nas a secret, his own personal dislike for Bernardo del Nero; and, after\r\nthis preparation, came to the important statement that there was\r\nanother Medicean plot, of which, if he obtained certain conditions from\r\nthe government, he could, by a journey to Siena and into Romagna, where\r\nPiero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici was again trying to gather forces, obtain documentary\r\nevidence to lay before the council. To this end it was essential that\r\nhis character as a Medicean agent should be unshaken for all Mediceans,\r\nand hence the fact that he had been a source of information to the\r\nauthorities must be wrapped in profound secrecy. Still, some odour of\r\nthe facts might escape in spite of precaution, and before Tito could\r\nincur the unpleasant consequences of acting against his friends, he\r\nmust be assured of immunity from any prosecution as a Medicean, and\r\nfrom deprivation of office for a year to come.\r\n\r\nThese propositions did not sound in the ear of Francesco Valori\r\nprecisely as they sound to us. Valori\xe2\x80\x99s mind was not intensely bent on\r\nthe estimation of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; and it _was_ intensely bent on\r\nprocuring an extreme sentence against the five prisoners. There were\r\nsure to be immense efforts to save them; and it was to be wished (on\r\npublic grounds) that the evidence against them should be of the\r\nstrongest, so as to alarm all well-affected men at the dangers of\r\nclemency. The character of legal proceedings at that time implied that\r\nevidence was one of those desirable things which could only be come at\r\nby foul means. To catch a few people and torture them into confessing\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s guilt was one step towards justice; and it was not always\r\neasy to see the next, unless a traitor turned up. Lamberto dell\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAntella had been tortured in aid of his previous willingness to tell\r\nmore than he knew; nevertheless, additional and stronger facts were\r\ndesirable, especially against Bernardo del Nero, who, so far as\r\nappeared hitherto, had simply refrained from betraying the late plot\r\nafter having tried in vain to discourage it; for the welfare of\r\nFlorence demanded that the guilt of Bernardo del Nero should be put in\r\nthe strongest light. So Francesco Valori zealously believed; and\r\nperhaps he was not himself aware that the strength of his zeal was\r\ndetermined by his hatred. He decided that Tito\xe2\x80\x99s proposition ought to\r\nbe accepted, laid it before his colleagues without disclosing Tito\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, and won them over to his opinion. Late in the day, Tito was\r\nadmitted to an audience of the Special Council, and produced a deep\r\nsensation among them by revealing another plot for insuring the mastery\r\nof Florence to Piero de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, which was to have been carried into\r\nexecution in the middle of this very month of August. Documentary\r\nevidence on this subject would do more than anything else to make the\r\nright course clear. He received a commission to start for Siena by\r\nbreak of day; and, besides this, he carried away with him from the\r\ncouncil-chamber a written guarantee of his immunity and of his\r\nretention of office.\r\n\r\nAmong the twenty Florentines who bent their grave eyes on Tito, as he\r\nstood gracefully before them, speaking of startling things with easy\r\nperiphrasis, and with that apparently unaffected admission of being\r\nactuated by motives short of the highest, which is often the intensest\r\naffectation, there were several whose minds were not too entirely\r\npreoccupied to pass a new judgment on him in these new circumstances;\r\nthey silently concluded that this ingenious and serviceable Greek was\r\nin future rather to be used for public needs than for private intimacy.\r\nUnprincipled men were useful, enabling those who had more scruples to\r\nkeep their hands tolerably clean in a world where there was much dirty\r\nwork to be done. Indeed, it was not clear to respectable Florentine\r\nbrains, unless they held the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s extravagant belief in a possible\r\npurity and loftiness to be striven for on this earth, how life was to\r\nbe carried on in any department without human instruments whom it would\r\nnot be unbecoming to kick or to spit upon in the act of handing them\r\ntheir wages. Some of these very men who passed a tacit judgment on Tito\r\nwere shortly to be engaged in a memorable transaction that could by no\r\nmeans have been carried through without the use of an unscrupulousness\r\nas decided as his; but, as their own bright poet Pulci had said for\r\nthem, it is one thing to love the fruits of treachery, and another\r\nthing to love traitors\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIl tradimento a molti piace assai,\r\nMa il traditore a gnun non piacque mal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same society has had a gibbet for the murderer and a gibbet for the\r\nmartyr, an execrating hiss for a dastardly act, and as loud a hiss for\r\nmany a word of generous truthfulness or just insight: a mixed condition\r\nof things which is the sign, not of hopeless confusion, but of\r\nstruggling order.\r\n\r\nFor Tito himself, he was not unaware that he had sunk a little in the\r\nestimate of the men who had accepted his services. He had that degree\r\nof self-contemplation which necessarily accompanies the habit of acting\r\non well-considered reasons, of whatever quality; and if he could have\r\nchosen, he would have declined to see himself disapproved by men of the\r\nworld. He had never meant to be disapproved; he had meant always to\r\nconduct himself so ably that if he acted in opposition to the standard\r\nof other men they should not be aware of it; and the barrier between\r\nhimself and Romola had been raised by the impossibility of such\r\nconcealment with her. He shrank from condemnatory judgments as from a\r\nclimate to which he could not adapt himself. But things were not so\r\nplastic in the hands of cleverness as could be wished, and events had\r\nturned out inconveniently. He had really no rancour against Messer\r\nBernardo del Nero: he had a personal liking for Lorenzo Tornabuoni and\r\nGiannozzo Pucci. He had served them very ably, and in such a way that\r\nif their party had been winners he would have merited high reward; but\r\nwas he to relinquish all the agreeable fruits of life because their\r\nparty had failed? His proffer of a little additional proof against them\r\nwould probably have no influence on their fate; in fact, he felt\r\nconvinced they would escape any extreme consequences; but if he had not\r\ngiven it, his own fortunes, which made a promising fabric, would have\r\nbeen utterly ruined. And what motive could any man really have, except\r\nhis own interest? Florentines whose passions were engaged in their\r\npetty and precarious political schemes might have no self-interest\r\nseparable from family pride and tenacity in old hatreds and\r\nattachments; a modern simpleton who swallowed whole one of the old\r\nsystems of philosophy, and took the indigestion it occasioned for the\r\nsigns of a divine afflux or the voice of an inward monitor, might see\r\nhis interest in a form of self-conceit which he called self-rewarding\r\nvirtue; fanatics who believed in the coming Scourge and Renovation\r\nmight see their own interest in a future palm-branch and white robe:\r\nbut no man of clear intellect allowed his course to be determined by\r\nsuch puerile impulses or questionable inward fumes. Did not Pontanus,\r\npoet and philosopher of unrivalled Latinity, make the finest possible\r\noration at Naples to welcome the French king, who had come to dethrone\r\nthe learned orator\xe2\x80\x99s royal friend and patron? and still Pontanus held\r\nup his head and prospered. Men did not really care about these things,\r\nexcept when their personal spleen was touched. It was weakness only\r\nthat was despised; power of any sort carried its immunity; and no man,\r\nunless by very rare good fortune, could mount high in the world without\r\nincurring a few unpleasant necessities which laid him open to enmity,\r\nand perhaps to a little hissing, when enmity wanted a pretext.\r\n\r\nIt was a faint prognostic of that hissing, gathered by Tito from\r\ncertain indications when he was before the council, which gave his\r\npresent conduct the character of an epoch to him, and made him dwell on\r\nit with argumentative vindication. It was not that he was taking a\r\ndeeper step in wrong-doing, for it was not possible that he should feel\r\nany tie to the Mediceans to be stronger than the tie to his father; but\r\nhis conduct to his father had been hidden by successful lying: his\r\npresent act did not admit of total concealment\xe2\x80\x94in its very nature it\r\nwas a revelation. And Tito winced under his new liability to disesteem.\r\n\r\nWell! a little patience, and in another year, or perhaps in half a\r\nyear, he might turn his back on these hard, eager Florentines, with\r\ntheir futile quarrels and sinking fortunes. His brilliant success at\r\nFlorence had had some ugly flaws in it: he had fallen in love with the\r\nwrong woman, and Baldassarre had come back under incalculable\r\ncircumstances. But as Tito galloped with a loose rein towards Siena, he\r\nsaw a future before him in which he would no longer be haunted by those\r\nmistakes. He had much money safe out of Florence already; he was in the\r\nfresh ripeness of eight-and-twenty; he was conscious of well-tried\r\nskill. Could he not strip himself of the past, as of rehearsal\r\nclothing, and throw away the old bundle, to robe himself for the real\r\nscene?\r\n\r\nIt did not enter into Tito\xe2\x80\x99s meditations on the future, that, on\r\nissuing from the council-chamber and descending the stairs, he had\r\nbrushed against a man whose face he had not stayed to recognise in the\r\nlamplight. The man was Ser Ceccone\xe2\x80\x94also willing to serve the State by\r\ngiving information against unsuccessful employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\nA Final Understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nTito soon returned from Siena, but almost immediately set out on\r\nanother journey, from which he did not return till the seventeenth of\r\nAugust. Nearly a fortnight had passed since the arrest of the accused,\r\nand still they were in prison, still their fate was uncertain. Romola\r\nhad felt during this interval as if all cares were suspended for her,\r\nother than watching the fluctuating probabilities concerning that fate.\r\nSometimes they seemed strongly in favour of the prisoners; for the\r\nchances of effective interest on their behalf were heightened by delay,\r\nand an indefinite prospect of delay was opened by the reluctance of all\r\npersons in authority to incur the odium attendant on any decision. On\r\nthe one side there was a loud cry that the Republic was in danger, and\r\nthat lenity to the prisoners would be the signal of attack for all its\r\nenemies; on the other, there was a certainty that a sentence of death\r\nand confiscation of property passed on five citizens of distinguished\r\nname, would entail the rancorous hatred of their relatives on all who\r\nwere conspicuously instrumental to such a sentence.\r\n\r\nThe final judgment properly lay with the Eight, who presided over the\r\nadministration of criminal justice; and the sentence depended on a\r\nmajority of six votes. But the Eight shrank from their onerous\r\nresponsibility, and asked in this exceptional case to have it shared by\r\nthe Signoria (or the Gonfaloniere and the eight Priors). The Signoria\r\nin its turn shrugged its shoulders, and proposed the appeal to the\r\nGreat Council. For, according to a law passed by the earnest persuasion\r\nof Savonarola nearly three years before, whenever a citizen was\r\ncondemned to death by the fatal six votes (called the _set fave_ or\r\n_six beans_, beans being in more senses than one the political pulse of\r\nFlorence), he had the right of appealing from that sentence to the\r\nGreat Council.\r\n\r\nBut in this stage of the business, the friends of the accused resisted\r\nthe appeal, determined chiefly by the wish to gain delay; and, in fact,\r\nstrict legality required that sentence should have been passed prior to\r\nthe appeal. Their resistance prevailed, and a middle course was taken;\r\nthe sentence was referred to a large assembly convened on the\r\nseventeenth, consisting of all the higher magistracies, the smaller\r\ncouncil or Senate of Eighty, and a select number of citizens.\r\n\r\nOn this day Romola, with anxiety heightened by the possibility that\r\nbefore its close her godfather\xe2\x80\x99s fate might be decided, had obtained\r\nleave to see him for the second time, but only in the presence of\r\nwitnesses. She had returned to the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi in company with her\r\ncousin Brigida, still ignorant whether the council had come to any\r\ndecisive issue; and Monna Brigida had gone out again to await the\r\nmomentous news at the house of a friend belonging to one of the\r\nmagistracies, that she might bring back authentic tidings as soon as\r\nthey were to be had.\r\n\r\nRomola had sunk on the first seat in the bright saloon, too much\r\nagitated, too sick at heart, to care about her place, or be conscious\r\nof discordance in the objects that surrounded her. She sat with her\r\nback to the door, resting her head on her hands. It seemed a long while\r\nsince Monna Brigida had gone, and Romola was expecting her return. But\r\nwhen the door opened she knew it was not Monna Brigida who entered.\r\n\r\nSince she had parted from Tito on that memorable night, she had had no\r\nexternal proof to warrant her belief that he had won his safety by\r\ntreachery; on the contrary, she had had evidence that he was still\r\ntrusted by the Mediceans, and was believed by them to be accomplishing\r\ncertain errands of theirs in Romagna, under cover of fulfilling a\r\ncommission of the government. For the obscurity in which the evidence\r\nconcerning the conspirators was shrouded allowed it to be understood\r\nthat Tito had escaped any implication.\r\n\r\nBut Romola\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion was not to be dissipated: her horror of his\r\nconduct towards Baldassarre projected itself over every conception of\r\nhis acts; it was as if she had seen him committing a murder, and had\r\nhad a diseased impression ever after that his hands were covered with\r\nfresh blood.\r\n\r\nAs she heard his step on the stone floor, a chill shudder passed\r\nthrough her; she could not turn round, she could not rise to give any\r\ngreeting. He did not speak, but after an instant\xe2\x80\x99s pause took a seat on\r\nthe other side of the table just opposite to her. Then she raised her\r\neyes and looked at him; but she was mute. He did not show any\r\nirritation, but said, coolly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis meeting corresponds with our parting, Romola. But I understand\r\nthat it is a moment of terrible suspense. I am come, however, if you\r\nwill listen to me, to bring you the relief of hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started, and altered her position, but looked at him dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be unwelcome to you to hear\xe2\x80\x94even though it is I who tell\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that the council is prorogued till the twenty-first. The Eight have\r\nbeen frightened at last into passing a sentence of condemnation, but\r\nthe demand has now been made on behalf of the condemned for the Appeal\r\nto the Great Council.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s face lost its dubious expression; she asked eagerly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when is it to be made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has not yet been granted; but it _may_ be granted. The Special\r\nCouncil is to meet again on the twenty-first to deliberate whether the\r\nAppeal shall be allowed or not. In the meantime there is an interval of\r\nthree days, in which chances may occur in favour of the prisoners\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nwhich interest may be used on their behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola started from her seat. The colour had risen to her face like a\r\nvisible thought, and her hands trembled. In that moment her feeling\r\ntowards Tito was forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, also rising, \xe2\x80\x9cyour own intention may have\r\nanticipated what I was going to say. You are thinking of the Frate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, looking at him with surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he done\r\nanything? Is there anything to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this. It was Messer Francesco Valori\xe2\x80\x99s bitterness and violence\r\nwhich chiefly determined the course of things in the council to-day.\r\nHalf the men who gave in their opinion against the prisoners were\r\nfrightened into it, and there are numerous friends of Fra Girolamo both\r\nin this Special Council and out of it who are strongly opposed to the\r\nsentence of death\xe2\x80\x94Piero Guicciardini, for example, who is one member of\r\nthe Signoria that made the stoutest resistance; and there is Giovan\r\nBattista Ridolfi, who, Piagnone as he is, will not lightly forgive the\r\ndeath of his brother Niccol\xc3\xb2.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can the Appeal be denied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it\r\nis the law\xe2\x80\x94when it was one of the chief glories of the popular\r\ngovernment to have passed the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey call this an exceptional case. Of course there are ingenious\r\narguments, but there is much more of loud bluster about the danger of\r\nthe Republic. But, you see, no opposition could prevent the assembly\r\nfrom being prorogued, and a certain powerful influence rightly applied\r\nduring the next three days might determine the wavering courage of\r\nthose who desire that the Appeal should be granted, and might even give\r\na check to the headlong enmity of Francesco Valori. It happens to have\r\ncome to my knowledge that the Frate has so far interfered as to send a\r\nmessage to him in favour of Lorenzo Tornabuoni. I know you can\r\nsometimes have access to the Frate: it might at all events be worth\r\nwhile to use your privilege now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, with an air of abstraction. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\nbelieve that the Frate would approve denying the Appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard it said by more than one person in the court of the Palazzo,\r\nbefore I came away, that it would be to the everlasting discredit of\r\nFra Girolamo if he allowed a government which is almost entirely made\r\nup of his party, to deny the Appeal, without entering his protest, when\r\nhe has been boasting in his books and sermons that it was he who got\r\nthe law passed.[1] But between ourselves, with all respect for your\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s ability, my Romola, he has got into the practice of preaching\r\nthat form of human sacrifices called killing tyrants and wicked\r\nmalcontents, which some of his followers are likely to think\r\ninconsistent with lenity in the present case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] The most recent, and in some respects the best, biographer of\r\n Savonarola, Signor Villari, endeavours to show that the Law of Appeal\r\n ultimately enacted, being wider than the law originally contemplated\r\n by Savonarola, was a source of bitter annoyance to him, as a\r\n contrivance of the aristocratic party for attaching to the measures of\r\n the popular government the injurious results of licence. But in taking\r\n this view the estimable biographer lost sight of the fact that, not\r\n only in his sermons, but in a deliberately prepared book (the\r\n _Compendium Revelationum_) written long after the Appeal had become\r\n law, Savonarola enumerates among the benefits secured to Florence,\r\n \xe2\x80\x9c_the Appeal from the Six Votes, advocated by me, for the greater\r\n security of the citizens_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, with a look and tone of pain. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he is\r\ndriven into those excesses of speech. It used to be different. I _will_\r\nask for an interview. I cannot rest without it. I trust in the\r\ngreatness of his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not looking at Tito; her eyes were bent with a vague gaze\r\ntowards the ground, and she had no distinct consciousness that the\r\nwords she heard came from her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter lose no time, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with unmixed suavity, moving\r\nhis cap round in his hands as if he were about to put it on and depart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Romola, you will perhaps be able to see, in spite of\r\nprejudice, that my wishes go with yours in this matter. You will not\r\nregard the misfortune of my safety as an offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething like an electric shock passed through Romola: it was the full\r\nconsciousness of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s presence returning to her. She looked at\r\nhim without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a slightly harder tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will endeavour to\r\nbase our intercourse on some other reasonings than that because an evil\r\ndeed is possible, _I_ have done it. Am I alone to be beyond the pale of\r\nyour extensive charity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe feeling which had been driven back from Romola\xe2\x80\x99s lips a fortnight\r\nbefore rose again with the gathered force of a tidal wave. She spoke\r\nwith a decision which told him that she was careless of consequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late, Tito. There is no killing the suspicion that deceit\r\nhas once begotten. And now I know everything. I know who that old man\r\nwas: he was your father, to whom you owe everything\xe2\x80\x94to whom you owe\r\nmore than if you had been his own child. By the side of that, it is a\r\nsmall thing that you broke my trust and my father\xe2\x80\x99s. As long as you\r\ndeny the truth about that old man, there is a horror rising between us:\r\nthe law that should make us one can never be obeyed. I too am a human\r\nbeing. I have a soul of my own that abhors your actions. Our union is a\r\npretence\xe2\x80\x94as if a perpetual lie could be a sacred marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito did not answer immediately. When he did speak it was with a\r\ncalculated caution, that was stimulated by alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean to carry out that independence by quitting me, I\r\npresume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire to quit you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, impetuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd supposing I do not submit to part with what the law gives me some\r\nsecurity for retaining? You will then, of course, proclaim your reasons\r\nin the ear of all Florence. You will bring forward your mad assassin,\r\nwho is doubtless ready to obey your call, and you will tell the world\r\nthat you believe his testimony because he is so rational as to desire\r\nto assassinate me. You will first inform the Signoria that I am a\r\nMedicean conspirator, and then you will inform the Mediceans that I\r\nhave betrayed them, and in both cases you will offer the excellent\r\nproof that you believe me capable in general of everything bad. It will\r\ncertainly be a striking position for a wife to adopt. And if, on such\r\nevidence, you succeed in holding me up to infamy, you will have\r\nsurpassed all the heroines of the Greek drama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, but she stood mute. He went on with the sense of\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you have no other grievance against me\xe2\x80\x94except that I have\r\nfailed in fulfilling some lofty indefinite conditions on which you gave\r\nme your wifely affection, so that, by withdrawing it, you have\r\ngradually reduced me to the careful supply of your wants as a fair\r\nPiagnone of high condition and liberal charities. I think your success\r\nin gibbeting me is not certain. But doubtless you would begin by\r\nwinning the ear of Messer Bernardo del Nero?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I speak of anything?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Romola, in anguish, sinking on her\r\nchair again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hateful in me to be thinking of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not notice when Tito left the room, or know how long it was\r\nbefore the door opened to admit Monna Brigida. But in that instant she\r\nstarted up and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin, we must go to San Marco directly. I must see my confessor, Fra\r\nSalvestro.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\nPleading.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning was in its early brightness when Romola was again on her\r\nway to San Marco, having obtained through Fra Salvestro, the evening\r\nbefore, the promise of an interview with Fra Girolamo in the\r\nchapter-house of the convent. The rigidity with which Savonarola\r\nguarded his life from all the pretexts of calumny made such interviews\r\nvery rare, and whenever they were granted, they were kept free from any\r\nappearance of mystery. For this reason the hour chosen was one at which\r\nthere were likely to be other visitors in the outer cloisters of San\r\nMarco.\r\n\r\nShe chose to pass through the heart of the city that she might notice\r\nthe signs of public feeling. Every loggia, every convenient corner of\r\nthe piazza, every shop that made a rendezvous for gossips, was astir\r\nwith the excitement of gratuitous debate; a languishing trade tending\r\nto make political discussion all the more vigorous. It was clear that\r\nthe parties for and against the death of the conspirators were bent on\r\nmaking the fullest use of the three days\xe2\x80\x99 interval in order to\r\ndetermine the popular mood. Already handbills were in circulation; some\r\npresenting, in large print, the alternative of justice on the\r\nconspirators or ruin to the Republic; others in equally large print\r\nurging the observance of the law and the granting of the Appeal. Round\r\nthese jutting islets of black capitals there were lakes of smaller\r\ncharacters setting forth arguments less necessary to be read: for it\r\nwas an opinion entertained at that time (in the first flush of triumph\r\nat the discovery of printing), that there was no argument more widely\r\nconvincing than question-begging phrases in large type.\r\n\r\nRomola, however, cared especially to become acquainted with the\r\narguments in smaller type, and, though obliged to hasten forward, she\r\nlooked round anxiously as she went that she might miss no opportunity\r\nof securing copies. For a long way she saw none but such as were in the\r\nhands of eager readers, or else fixed on the walls, from which in some\r\nplaces the sbirri were tearing them down. But at last, passing behind\r\nSan Giovanni with a quickened pace that she might avoid the many\r\nacquaintances who frequented the piazza, she saw Bratti with a stock of\r\nhandbills which he appeared to be exchanging for small coin with the\r\npassers-by. She was too familiar with the humble life of Florence for\r\nBratti to be any stranger to her, and turning towards him she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you two sorts of handbills, Bratti? Let me have them quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo sorts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, separating the wet sheets with a slowness\r\nthat tried Romola\xe2\x80\x99s patience. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Law,\xe2\x80\x99 and there\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich sort do you sell most of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Justice\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Justice\xe2\x80\x99 goes the quickest,\xe2\x80\x94so I raised the price, and made\r\nit two danari. But then I bethought me the \xe2\x80\x98Law\xe2\x80\x99 was good ware too, and\r\nhad as good a right to be charged for as \xe2\x80\x98Justice;\xe2\x80\x99 for people set no\r\nstore by cheap things, and if I sold the \xe2\x80\x98Law\xe2\x80\x99 at one danaro, I should\r\nbe doing it a wrong. And I\xe2\x80\x99m a fair trader. \xe2\x80\x98Law,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Justice,\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall one to me; they\xe2\x80\x99re good wares. I got \xe2\x80\x99em both for nothing, and I\r\nsell \xe2\x80\x99em at a fair profit. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll want more than one of a sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no: here\xe2\x80\x99s a white quattrino for the two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, folding up\r\nthe bills and hurrying away.\r\n\r\nShe was soon in the outer cloisters of San Marco, where Fra Salvestro\r\nwas awaiting her under the cloister, but did not notice the approach of\r\nher light step. He was chatting, according to his habit, with lay\r\nvisitors; for under the auspices of a government friendly to the Frate,\r\nthe timidity about frequenting San Marco, which had followed on the\r\nfirst shock of the Excommunication, had been gradually giving way. In\r\none of these lay visitors she recognised a well-known satellite of\r\nFrancesco Valori, named Andrea Cambini, who was narrating or expounding\r\nwith emphatic gesticulation, while Fra Salvestro was listening with\r\nthat air of trivial curiosity which tells that the listener cares very\r\nmuch about news and very little about its quality. This characteristic\r\nof her confessor, which was always repulsive to Romola, was made\r\nexasperating to her at this moment by the certainty she gathered, from\r\nthe disjointed words which reached her ear, that Cambini was narrating\r\nsomething relative to the fate of the conspirators. She chose not to\r\napproach the group, but as soon as she saw that she had arrested Fra\r\nSalvestro\xe2\x80\x99s attention, she turned towards the door of the\r\nchapter-house, while he, making a sign of approval, disappeared within\r\nthe inner cloister. A lay Brother stood ready to open the door of the\r\nchapter-house for her, and closed it behind her as she entered.\r\n\r\nOnce more looked at by those sad frescoed figures which had seemed to\r\nbe mourning with her at the death of her brother Dino, it was\r\ninevitable that something of that scene should come back to her; but\r\nthe intense occupation of her mind with the present made the\r\nremembrance less a retrospect than an indistinct recurrence of\r\nimpressions which blended themselves with her agitating fears, as if\r\nher actual anxiety were a revival of the strong yearning she had once\r\nbefore brought to this spot\xe2\x80\x94to be repelled by marble rigidity. She gave\r\nno space for the remembrance to become more definite, for she at once\r\nopened the handbills, thinking she should perhaps be able to read them\r\nin the interval before Fra Girolamo appeared. But by the time she had\r\nread to the end of the one that recommended the observance of the law,\r\nthe door was opening, and doubling up the papers she stood expectant.\r\n\r\nWhen the Frate had entered she knelt, according to the usual practice\r\nof those who saw him in private; but as soon as he had uttered a\r\nbenedictory greeting she rose and stood opposite to him at a few yards\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndistance. Owing to his seclusion since he had been excommunicated, it\r\nhad been an unusually long while since she had seen him, and the late\r\nmonths had visibly deepened in his face the marks of over-taxed mental\r\nactivity and bodily severities; and yet Romola was not so conscious of\r\nthis change as of another, which was less definable. Was it that the\r\nexpression of serene elevation and pure human fellowship which had once\r\nmoved her was no longer present in the same force, or was it that the\r\nsense of his being divided from her in her feeling about her godfather\r\nroused the slumbering sources of alienation, and marred her own vision?\r\nPerhaps both causes were at work. Our relations with our fellow-men are\r\nmost often determined by coincident currents of that sort; the\r\ninexcusable word or deed seldom comes until after affection or\r\nreverence has been already enfeebled by the strain of repeated excuses.\r\n\r\nIt was true that Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s glance at Romola had some of that\r\nhardness which is caused by an egotistic prepossession. He divined that\r\nthe interview she had sought was to turn on the fate of the\r\nconspirators, a subject on which he had already had to quell inner\r\nvoices that might become loud again when encouraged from without.\r\nSeated in his cell, correcting the sheets of his \xe2\x80\x98Triumph of the\r\nCross,\xe2\x80\x99 it was easier to repose on a resolution of neutrality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a question of moment, doubtless, on which you wished to see me,\r\nmy daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in a tone which was gentle rather from\r\nself-control than from immediate inclination. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are not wont\r\nto lay stress on small matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, you know what it is before I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola,\r\nforgetting everything else as soon as she began to pour forth her plea.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I am caring for\xe2\x80\x94it is for the life of the old man I love\r\nbest in the world. The thought of him has gone together with the\r\nthought of my father as long as I remember the daylight. That is my\r\nwarrant for coming to you, even if my coming should have been needless.\r\nPerhaps it is: perhaps you have already determined that your power over\r\nthe hearts of men shall be used to prevent them from denying to\r\nFlorentines a right which you yourself helped to earn for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meddle not with the functions of the State, my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fra\r\nGirolamo, strongly disinclined to reopen externally a debate which he\r\nhad already gone through inwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have preached and laboured that\r\nFlorence should have a good government, for a good government is\r\nneedful to the perfecting of the Christian life; but I keep away my\r\nhands from particular affairs which it is the office of experienced\r\ncitizens to administer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Romola broke off. She had uttered this first word\r\nalmost impetuously, but she was checked by the counter-agitation of\r\nfeeling herself in an attitude of remonstrance towards the man who had\r\nbeen the source of guidance and strength to her. In the act of\r\nrebelling she was bruising her own reverence.\r\n\r\nSavonarola was too keen not to divine something of the conflict that\r\nwas arresting her\xe2\x80\x94too noble, deliberately to assume in calm speech that\r\nself-justifying evasiveness into which he was often hurried in public\r\nby the crowding impulses of the orator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what is in your heart; speak on, my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, standing\r\nwith his arms laid one upon the other, and looking at her with quiet\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to say, father, that this matter is surely of higher\r\nmoment than many about which I have heard you preach and exhort\r\nfervidly. If it belonged to you to urge that men condemned for offences\r\nagainst the State should have the right to appeal to the Great\r\nCouncil\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Romola was getting eager again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif you count it a glory to\r\nhave won that right for them, can it less belong to you to declare\r\nyourself against the right being denied to almost the first men who\r\nneed it? Surely that touches the Christian life more closely than\r\nwhether you knew beforehand that the Dauphin would die, or whether Pisa\r\nwill be conquered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a subtle movement, like a subdued sign of pain, in\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s strong lips, before he began to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, I speak as it is given me to speak\xe2\x80\x94I am not master of the\r\ntimes when I may become the vehicle of knowledge beyond the common\r\nlights of men. In this case I have no illumination beyond what wisdom\r\nmay give to those who are charged with the safety of the State. As to\r\nthe law of Appeal against the Six Votes, I laboured to have it passed\r\nin order that no Florentine should be subject to loss of life and goods\r\nthrough the private hatred of a few who might happen to be in power;\r\nbut these five men, who have desired to overthrow a free government and\r\nrestore a corrupt tyrant, have been condemned with the assent of a\r\nlarge assembly of their fellow-citizens. They refused at first to have\r\ntheir cause brought before the Great Council. They have lost the right\r\nto the appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can they have lost it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the right to appeal\r\nagainst condemnation, and they have never been condemned till now; and,\r\nforgive me, father, it _is_ private hatred that would deny them the\r\nappeal; it _is_ the violence of the few that frightens others; else why\r\nwas the assembly divided again directly after it had seemed to agree?\r\nAnd if anything weighs against the observance of the law, let this\r\nweigh for it\xe2\x80\x94this, that you used to preach more earnestly than all\r\nelse, that there should be no place given to hatred and bloodshed\r\nbecause of these party strifes, so that private ill-will should not\r\nfind its opportunities in public acts. Father, you know that there is\r\nprivate hatred concerned here: will it not dishonour you not to have\r\ninterposed on the side of mercy, when there are many who hold that it\r\nis also the side of law and justice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fra Girolamo, with more visible emotion than\r\nbefore, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a mercy which is weakness, and even treason against\r\nthe common good. The safety of Florence, which means even more than the\r\nwelfare of Florentines, now demands severity, as it once demanded\r\nmercy. It is not only for a past plot that these men are condemned, but\r\nalso for a plot which has not yet been executed; and the devices that\r\nwere leading to its execution are not put an end to: the tyrant is\r\nstill gathering his forces in Romagna, and the enemies of Florence, who\r\nsit in the highest places of Italy, are ready to hurl any stone that\r\nwill crush her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat plot?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, reddening, and trembling with alarmed\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou carry papers in your hand, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fra Girolamo, pointing to\r\nthe handbills. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of them will, perhaps, tell you that the government\r\nhas had new information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola hastily opened the handbill she had not yet read, and saw that\r\nthe government had now positive evidence of a second plot, which was to\r\nhave been carried out in this August time. To her mind it was like\r\nreading a confirmation that Tito had won his safety by foul means; his\r\npretence of wishing that the Frate should exert himself on behalf of\r\nthe condemned only helped the wretched conviction. She crushed up the\r\npaper in her hand, and, turning to Savonarola, she said, with new\r\npassion, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, what safety can there be for Florence when the worst\r\nman can always escape? And,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, a sudden flash of remembrance\r\ncoming from the thought about her husband, \xe2\x80\x9chave not you yourself\r\nencouraged this deception which corrupts the life of Florence, by\r\nwanting more favour to be shown to Lorenzo Tornabuoni, who has worn two\r\nfaces, and flattered you with a show of affection, when my godfather\r\nhas always been honest? Ask all Florence who of those five men has the\r\ntruest heart, and there will not be many who will name any other name\r\nthan Bernardo del Nero. You did interpose with Francesco Valori for the\r\nsake of one prisoner: you have _not_ then been neutral; and you know\r\nthat your word will be powerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not desire the death of Bernardo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Savonarola, colouring\r\ndeeply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be enough if he were sent out of the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you not speak to save an old man of seventy-five from\r\ndying a death of ignominy\xe2\x80\x94to give him at least the fair chances of the\r\nlaw?\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Romola, the impetuosity of her nature so roused that\r\nshe forgot everything but her indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that you feel\r\nbound to be neutral; else why did you speak for Lorenzo Tornabuoni? You\r\nspoke for him because he is more friendly to San Marco; my godfather\r\nfeigns no friendship. It is not, then, as a Medicean that my godfather\r\nis to die; it is as a man you have no love for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Romola paused, with cheeks glowing, and with quivering lips, there\r\nwas dead silence. As she saw Fra Girolamo standing motionless before\r\nher, she seemed to herself to be hearing her own words over again;\r\nwords that in this echo of consciousness were in strange, painful\r\ndissonance with the memories that made part of his presence to her. The\r\nmoments of silence were expanded by gathering compunction and\r\nself-doubt. She had committed sacrilege in her passion. And even the\r\nsense that she could retract nothing of her plea, that her mind could\r\nnot submit itself to Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s negative, made it the more needful to\r\nher to satisfy those reverential memories. With a sudden movement\r\ntowards him she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, father; it is pain to me to have spoken those words\xe2\x80\x94yet I\r\ncannot help speaking. I am little and feeble compared with you; you\r\nbrought me light and strength. But I submitted because I felt the\r\nproffered strength\xe2\x80\x94because I saw the light. _Now_ I cannot see it.\r\nFather, you yourself declare that there comes a moment when the soul\r\nmust have no guide but the voice within it, to tell whether the\r\nconsecrated thing has sacred virtue. And therefore I must speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSavonarola had that readily-roused resentment towards opposition,\r\nhardly separable from a power-loving and powerful nature, accustomed to\r\nseek great ends that cast a reflected grandeur on the means by which\r\nthey are sought. His sermons have much of that red flame in them. And\r\nif he had been a meaner man his susceptibility might have shown itself\r\nin irritation at Romola\xe2\x80\x99s accusatory freedom, which was in strong\r\ncontrast with the deference he habitually received from his disciples.\r\nBut at this moment such feelings were nullified by that hard struggle\r\nwhich made half the tragedy of his life\xe2\x80\x94the struggle of a mind\r\npossessed by a never-silent hunger after purity and simplicity, yet\r\ncaught in a tangle of egoistic demands, false ideas, and difficult\r\noutward conditions, that made simplicity impossible. Keenly alive to\r\nall the suggestions of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrating words, he was rapidly\r\nsurveying, as he had done before, the courses of action that were open\r\nto him, and their probable results. But it was a question on which\r\narguments could seem decisive only in proportion as they were charged\r\nwith feeling, and he had received no impulse that could alter his bias.\r\nHe looked at Romola, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have full pardon for your frankness, my daughter. You speak, I\r\nknow, out of the fulness of your family affections. But these\r\naffections must give way to the needs of the Republic. If those men who\r\nhave a close acquaintance with the affairs of the State believe, as I\r\nunderstand they do, that the public safety requires the extreme\r\npunishment of the law to fall on the five conspirators, I cannot\r\ncontrol their opinion, seeing that I stand aloof from such affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you desire that they should die? You desire that the Appeal\r\nshould be denied them?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, feeling anew repelled by a\r\nvindication which seemed to her to have the nature of a subterfuge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said that I do not desire their death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, her indignation rising again, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can be\r\nindifferent that Florentines should inflict death which you do not\r\ndesire, when you might have protested against it\xe2\x80\x94when you might have\r\nhelped to hinder it, by urging the observance of a law which you held\r\nit good to get passed. Father, you used not to stand aloof: you used\r\nnot to shrink from protesting. Do not say you cannot protest where the\r\nlives of men are concerned; say rather, you desire their death. Say\r\nrather, you hold it good for Florence that there shall be more blood\r\nand more hatred. Will the death of five Mediceans put an end to parties\r\nin Florence? Will the death of a noble old man like Bernardo del Nero\r\nsave a city that holds such men as Dolfo Spini?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, it is enough. The cause of freedom, which is the cause of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom upon earth, is often most injured by the enemies who\r\ncarry within them the power of certain human virtues. The wickedest man\r\nis often not the most insurmountable obstacle to the triumph of good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you say again, that you do not desire my godfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in mingled anger and despair. \xe2\x80\x9cRather, you hold it\r\nthe more needful he should die because he is the better man. I cannot\r\nunravel your thoughts, father; I cannot hear the real voice of your\r\njudgment and conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. Then Savonarola said, with keener emotion\r\nthan he had yet shown\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe thankful, my daughter, if your own soul has been spared perplexity;\r\nand judge not those to whom a harder lot has been given. _You_ see one\r\nground of action in this matter. I see many. I have to choose that\r\nwhich will further the work intrusted to me. The end I seek is one to\r\nwhich minor respects must be sacrificed. The death of five men\xe2\x80\x94were\r\nthey less guilty than these\xe2\x80\x94is a light matter weighed against the\r\nwithstanding of the vicious tyrannies which stifle the life of Italy,\r\nand foster the corruption of the Church; a light matter weighed against\r\nthe furthering of God\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom upon earth, the end for which I live\r\nand am willing myself to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances, Romola would have been sensitive to the\r\nappeal at the beginning of Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s speech; but at this moment she\r\nwas so utterly in antagonism with him, that what he called perplexity\r\nseemed to her sophistry and doubleness; and as he went on, his words\r\nonly fed that flame of indignation, which now again, more fully than\r\never before, lit up the memory of all his mistakes, and made her trust\r\nin him seem to have been a purblind delusion. She spoke almost with\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, then, know so well what will further the coming of God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkingdom, father, that you will dare to despise the plea of mercy\xe2\x80\x94of\r\njustice\xe2\x80\x94of faithfulness to your own teaching? Has the French king,\r\nthen, brought renovation to Italy? Take care, father, lest your enemies\r\nhave some reason when they say, that in your visions of what will\r\nfurther God\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom you see only what will strengthen your own\r\nparty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is true!\xe2\x80\x9d said Savonarola, with flashing eyes. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nhad seemed to him in that moment the voice of his enemies. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cause\r\nof my party _is_ the cause of God\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, her whole frame shaken with\r\npassionate repugnance. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom is something wider\xe2\x80\x94else, let me\r\nstand outside it with the beings that I love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two faces were lit up, each with an opposite emotion, each with an\r\nopposite certitude. Further words were impossible. Romola hastily\r\ncovered her head and went out in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\nThe Scaffold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later the moon that was just surmounting the buildings of\r\nthe piazza in front of the Old Palace within the hour of midnight, did\r\nnot make the usual broad lights and shadows on the pavement. Not a\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth of pavement was to be seen, but only the heads of an\r\neager struggling multitude. And instead of that background of silence\r\nin which the pattering footsteps and buzzing voices, the lute-thrumming\r\nor rapid scampering of the many night wanderers of Florence stood out\r\nin obtrusive distinctness, there was the background of a roar from\r\nmingled shouts and imprecations, tramplings and pushings, and\r\naccidental clashing of weapons, across which nothing was\r\ndistinguishable but a darting shriek, or the heavy dropping toll of a\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nAlmost all who could call themselves the public of Florence were awake\r\nat that hour, and either enclosed within the limits of that piazza, or\r\nstruggling to enter it. Within the palace were still assembled in the\r\ncouncil-chamber all the chief magistracies, the eighty members of the\r\nsenate, and the other select citizens who had been in hot debate\r\nthrough long hours of daylight and torchlight whether the Appeal should\r\nbe granted or whether the sentence of death should be executed on the\r\nprisoners forthwith, to forestall the dangerous chances of delay. And\r\nthe debate had been so much like fierce quarrel that the noise from the\r\ncouncil-chamber had reached the crowd outside. Only within the last\r\nhour had the question been decided: the Signoria had remained divided,\r\nfour of them standing out resolutely for the Appeal in spite of the\r\nstrong argument that if they did not give way their houses should be\r\nsacked, until Francesco Valori, in brief and furious speech, made the\r\ndetermination of his party more ominously distinct by declaring that if\r\nthe Signoria would not defend the liberties of the Florentine people by\r\nexecuting those five perfidious citizens, there would not be wanting\r\nothers who would take that cause in hand to the peril of all who\r\nopposed it. The Florentine Cato triumphed. When the votes were counted\r\nagain, the four obstinate white beans no longer appeared; the whole\r\nnine were of the fatal affirmative black, deciding the death of the\r\nfive prisoners without delay\xe2\x80\x94deciding also, only tacitly and with much\r\nmore delay, the death of Francesco Valori.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while the judicial Eight were gone to the Bargello to prepare\r\nfor the execution, the five condemned men were being led barefoot and\r\nin irons through the midst of the council. It was their friends who had\r\ncontrived this: would not Florentines be moved by the visible\r\nassociation of such cruel ignominy with two venerable men like Bernardo\r\ndel Nero and Niccol\xc3\xb2 Ridolfi, who had taken their bias long before the\r\nnew order of things had come to make Mediceanism retrograde\xe2\x80\x94with two\r\nbrilliant popular young men like Tornabuoni and Pucci, whose absence\r\nwould be felt as a haunting vacancy wherever there was a meeting of\r\nchief Florentines? It was useless: such pity as could be awakened now\r\nwas of that hopeless sort which leads not to rescue, but to the tardier\r\naction of revenge.\r\n\r\nWhile this scene was passing upstairs Romola stood below against one of\r\nthe massive pillars in the court of the palace, expecting the moment\r\nwhen her godfather would appear, on his way to execution. By the use of\r\nstrong interest she had gained permission to visit him in the evening\r\nof this day, and remain with him until the result of the council should\r\nbe determined. And now she was waiting with his confessor to follow the\r\nguard that would lead him to the Bargello. Her heart was bent on\r\nclinging to the presence of the childless old man to the last moment,\r\nas her father would have done; and she had overpowered all\r\nremonstrances. Giovan Battista Ridolfi, a disciple of Savonarola, who\r\nwas going in bitterness to behold the death of his elder brother\r\nNiccol\xc3\xb2, had promised that she should be guarded, and now stood by her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nTito, too, was in the palace; but Romola had not seen him. Since the\r\nevening of the seventeenth they had avoided each other, and Tito only\r\nknew by inference from the report of the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s neutrality that her\r\npleading had failed. He was now surrounded with official and other\r\npersonages, both Florentine and foreign, who had been awaiting the\r\nissue of the long-protracted council, maintaining, except when he was\r\ndirectly addressed, the subdued air and grave silence of a man whom\r\nactual events are placing in a painful state of strife between public\r\nand private feeling. When an allusion was made to his wife in relation\r\nto those events, he implied that, owing to the violent excitement of\r\nher mind, the mere fact of his continuing to hold office under a\r\ngovernment concerned in her godfather\xe2\x80\x99s condemnation, roused in her a\r\ndiseased hostility towards him; so that for her sake he felt it best\r\nnot to approach her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the old Bardi blood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be\r\nsurprised if this business shakes _her_ loose from the Frate, as well\r\nas some others I could name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is excusable in a woman, who is doubtless beautiful, since she is\r\nthe wife of Messer Tito,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young French envoy, smiling and bowing\r\nto Tito, \xe2\x80\x9cto think that her affections must overrule the good of the\r\nState, and that nobody is to be beheaded who is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s cousin; but\r\nsuch a view is not to be encouraged in the male population. It seems to\r\nme your Florentine polity is much weakened by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Niccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli; \xe2\x80\x9cbut where personal ties are\r\nstrong, the hostilities they raise must be taken due account of. Many\r\nof these half-way severities are mere hot-headed blundering. The only\r\nsafe blows to be inflicted on men and parties are the blows that are\r\ntoo heavy to be avenged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiccol\xc3\xb2,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a clever wickedness in thy talk\r\nsometimes that makes me mistrust thy pleasant young face as if it were\r\na mask of Satan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my good Domenico,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, smiling, and laying\r\nhis hand on the elder\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cSatan was a blunderer, an introducer\r\nof _novita_, who made a stupendous failure. If he had succeeded, we\r\nshould all have been worshipping him, and his portrait would have been\r\nmore flattered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cennini, \xe2\x80\x9cI say not thy doctrine is not too clever\r\nfor Satan: I only say it is wicked enough for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macchiavelli, \xe2\x80\x9cmy doctrine is the doctrine of all\r\nmen who seek an end a little farther off than their own noses. Ask our\r\nFrate, our prophet, how his universal renovation is to be brought\r\nabout: he will tell you, first, by getting a free and pure government;\r\nand since it appears that this cannot be done by making all Florentines\r\nlove each other, it must be done by cutting off every head that happens\r\nto be obstinately in the way. Only if a man incurs odium by sanctioning\r\na severity that is not thorough enough to be final, he commits a\r\nblunder. And something like that blunder, I suspect, the Frate has\r\ncommitted. It was an occasion on which he might have won some lustre by\r\nexerting himself to maintain the Appeal; instead of that, he has lost\r\nlustre, and has gained no strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore any one else could speak, there came the expected announcement\r\nthat the prisoners were about to leave the council-chamber; and the\r\nmajority of those who were present hurried towards the door, intent on\r\nsecuring the freest passage to the Bargello in the rear of the\r\nprisoners\xe2\x80\x99 guard; for the scene of the execution was one that drew\r\nalike those who were moved by the deepest passions and those who were\r\nmoved by the coldest curiosity.\r\n\r\nTito was one of those who remained behind. He had a native repugnance\r\nto sights of death and pain, and five days ago whenever he had thought\r\nof this execution as a possibility he had hoped that it would not take\r\nplace, and that the utmost sentence would be exile: his own safety\r\ndemanded no more. But now he felt that it would be a welcome guarantee\r\nof his security when he had learned that Bernardo del Nero\xe2\x80\x99s head was\r\noff the shoulders. The new knowledge and new attitude towards him\r\ndisclosed by Romola on the day of his return, had given him a new dread\r\nof the power she possessed to make his position insecure. If any act of\r\nhers only succeeded in making him an object of suspicion and odium, he\r\nforesaw not only frustration, but frustration under unpleasant\r\ncircumstances. Her belief in Baldassarre had clearly determined her\r\nwavering feelings against further submission, and if her godfather\r\nlived she would win him to share her belief without much trouble.\r\nRomola seemed more than ever an unmanageable fact in his destiny. But\r\nif Bernardo del Nero were dead, the difficulties that would beset her\r\nin placing herself in opposition to her husband would probably be\r\ninsurmountable to her shrinking pride. Therefore Tito had felt easier\r\nwhen he knew that the Eight had gone to the Bargello to order the\r\ninstant erection of the scaffold. Four other men\xe2\x80\x94his intimates and\r\nconfederates\xe2\x80\x94were to die, besides Bernardo del Nero. But a man\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nsafety is a god that sometimes makes very grim demands. Tito felt them\r\nto be grim: even in the pursuit of what was agreeable, this paradoxical\r\nlife forced upon him the desire for what was disagreeable. But he had\r\nhad other experience of this sort, and as he heard through the open\r\ndoorway the shuffle of many feet and the clanking of metal on the\r\nstairs, he was able to answer the questions of the young French envoy\r\nwithout showing signs of any other feeling than that of sad resignation\r\nto State necessities.\r\n\r\nThose sounds fell on Romola as if her power of hearing had been exalted\r\nalong with every other sensibility of her nature. She needed no arm to\r\nsupport her; she shed no tears. She felt that intensity of life which\r\nseems to transcend both grief and joy\xe2\x80\x94in which the mind seems to itself\r\nakin to elder forces that wrought out existence before the birth of\r\npleasure and pain. Since her godfather\xe2\x80\x99s fate had been decided, the\r\nprevious struggle of feeling in her had given way to an identification\r\nof herself with him in these supreme moments: she was inwardly\r\nasserting for him that, if he suffered the punishment of treason, he\r\ndid not deserve the name of traitor; he was the victim to a collision\r\nbetween two kinds of faithfulness. It was not given him to die for the\r\nnoblest cause, and yet he died because of his nobleness. He might have\r\nbeen a meaner man and found it easier not to incur this guilt. Romola\r\nwas feeling the full force of that sympathy with the individual lot\r\nthat is continually opposing itself to the formulae by which actions\r\nand parties are judged. She was treading the way with her second father\r\nto the scaffold, and nerving herself to defy ignominy by the\r\nconsciousness that it was not deserved.\r\n\r\nThe way was fenced in by three hundred armed men, who had been placed\r\nas a guard by the orders of Francesco Valori, for among the apparent\r\ncontradictions that belonged to this event, not the least striking was\r\nthe alleged alarm on the one hand at the popular rage against the\r\nconspirators, and the alleged alarm on the other lest there should be\r\nan attempt to rescue them in the midst of a hostile crowd. When they\r\nhad arrived within the court of the Bargello, Romola was allowed to\r\napproach Bernardo with his confessor for a moment of farewell. Many\r\neyes were bent on them even in that struggle of an agitated throng, as\r\nthe aged man, forgetting that his hands were bound with irons, lifted\r\nthem towards the golden head that was bent towards him, and then,\r\nchecking that movement, leaned to kiss her. She seized the fettered\r\nhands that were hung down again, and kissed them as if they had been\r\nsacred things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Romola,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernardo, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI have only to die,\r\nbut thou hast to live\xe2\x80\x94and I shall not be there to help thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _will_ help me\xe2\x80\x94always\xe2\x80\x94because I\r\nshall remember you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was taken away and conducted up the flight of steps that led to the\r\nloggia surrounding the grand old court. She took her place there,\r\ndetermined to look till the moment when her godfather laid his head on\r\nthe block. Now while the prisoners were allowed a brief interval with\r\ntheir confessor, the spectators were pressing into court until the\r\ncrowd became dense around the black scaffold, and the torches fixed in\r\niron rings against the pillars threw a varying startling light at one\r\nmoment on passionless stone carvings, at another on some pale face\r\nagitated with suppressed rage or suppressed grief\xe2\x80\x94the face of one among\r\nthe many near relatives of the condemned, who were presently to receive\r\ntheir dead and carry them home.\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s face looked like a marble image against the dark arch as she\r\nstood watching for the moment when her godfather would appear at the\r\nfoot of the scaffold. He was to suffer first, and Battista Ridolfi, who\r\nwas by her side, had promised to take her away through a door behind\r\nthem when she would have seen the last look of the man who alone in all\r\nthe world had shared her pitying love for her father. And still, in the\r\nbackground of her thought, there was the possibility striving to be a\r\nhope, that some rescue might yet come, something that would keep that\r\nscaffold unstained by blood.\r\n\r\nFor a long while there was constant movement, lights flickering, heads\r\nswaying to and fro, confused voices within the court, rushing waves of\r\nsound through the entrance from without. It seemed to Romola as if she\r\nwere in the midst of a storm-troubled sea, caring nothing about the\r\nstorm, caring only to hold out a signal till the eyes that looked for\r\nit could seek it no more.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was stillness, and the very tapers seemed to tremble\r\ninto quiet. The executioner was ready on the scaffold, and Bernardo del\r\nNero was seen ascending it with a slow firm step. Romola made no\r\nvisible movement, uttered not even a suppressed sound: she stood more\r\nfirmly, caring for _his_ firmness. She saw him pause, saw the white\r\nhead kept erect, while he said, in a voice distinctly audible\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is but a short space of life that my fellow-citizens have taken\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe perceived that he was gazing slowly round him as he spoke. She felt\r\nthat his eyes were resting on her, and that she was stretching out her\r\narms towards him. Then she saw no more till\xe2\x80\x94a long while after, as it\r\nseemed\xe2\x80\x94a voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, all is peace now. I can conduct you\r\nto your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uncovered her head and saw her godfather\xe2\x80\x99s confessor standing by\r\nher, in a room where there were other grave men talking in subdued\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us lose no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought all clinging was at an end for her: all her strength now\r\nshould be given to escape from a grasp under which she shuddered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\nDrifting Away.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day from that memorable night Romola was standing on the\r\nbrink of the Mediterranean, watching the gentle summer pulse of the sea\r\njust above what was then the little fishing village of Viareggio.\r\n\r\nAgain she had fled from Florence, and this time no arresting voice had\r\ncalled her back. Again she wore the grey religious dress; and this\r\ntime, in her heart-sickness, she did not care that it was a disguise. A\r\nnew rebellion had risen within her, a new despair. Why should she care\r\nabout wearing one badge more than another, or about being called by her\r\nown name? She despaired of finding any consistent duty belonging to\r\nthat name. What force was there to create for her that supremely\r\nhallowed motive which men call duty, but which can have no inward\r\nconstraining existence save through some form of believing love?\r\n\r\nThe bonds of all strong affection were snapped. In her marriage, the\r\nhighest bond of all, she had ceased to see the mystic union which is\r\nits own guarantee of indissolubleness, had ceased even to see the\r\nobligation of a voluntary pledge: had she not proved that the things to\r\nwhich she had pledged herself were impossible? The impulse to set\r\nherself free had risen again with overmastering force; yet the freedom\r\ncould only be an exchange of calamity. There is no compensation for the\r\nwoman who feels that the chief relation of her life has been no more\r\nthan a mistake. She has lost her crown. The deepest secret of human\r\nblessedness has half whispered itself to her, and then for ever passed\r\nher by.\r\n\r\nAnd now Romola\xe2\x80\x99s best support under that supreme woman\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow had\r\nslipped away from her. The vision of any great purpose, any end of\r\nexistence which could ennoble endurance and exalt the common deeds of a\r\ndusty life with divine ardours, was utterly eclipsed for her now by the\r\nsense of a confusion in human things which made all effort a mere\r\ndragging at tangled threads; all fellowship, either for resistance or\r\nadvocacy, mere unfairness and exclusiveness. What, after all, was the\r\nman who had represented for her the highest heroism: the heroism not of\r\nhard, self-contained endurance, but of willing, self-offering love?\r\nWhat was the cause he was struggling for? Romola had lost her trust in\r\nSavonarola, had lost that fervour of admiration which had made her\r\nunmindful of his aberrations, and attentive only to the grand curve of\r\nhis orbit. And now that her keen feeling for her godfather had thrown\r\nher into antagonism with the Frate, she saw all the repulsive and\r\ninconsistent details in his teaching with a painful lucidity which\r\nexaggerated their proportions. In the bitterness of her disappointment\r\nshe said that his striving after the renovation of the Church and the\r\nworld was a striving after a mere name which told no more than the\r\ntitle of a book: a name that had come to mean practically the measures\r\nthat would strengthen his own position in Florence; nay, often\r\nquestionable deeds and words, for the sake of saving his influence from\r\nsuffering by his own errors. And that political reform which had once\r\nmade a new interest in her life seemed now to reduce itself to narrow\r\ndevices for the safety of Florence, in contemptible contradiction with\r\nthe alternating professions of blind trust in the Divine care.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that she should judge the Frate unfairly on a\r\nquestion of individual suffering, at which she looked with the eyes of\r\npersonal tenderness, and _he_ with the eyes of theoretic conviction. In\r\nthat declaration of his, that the cause of his party was the cause of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, she heard only the ring of egoism. Perhaps such words\r\nhave rarely been uttered without that meaner ring in them; yet they are\r\nthe implicit formula of all energetic belief. And if such energetic\r\nbelief, pursuing a grand and remote end, is often in danger of becoming\r\na demon-worship, in which the votary lets his son and daughter pass\r\nthrough the fire with a readiness that hardly looks like sacrifice;\r\ntender fellow-feeling for the nearest has its danger too, and is apt to\r\nbe timid and sceptical towards the larger aims without which life\r\ncannot rise into religion. In this way poor Romola was being blinded by\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\nNo one who has ever known what it is thus to lose faith in a fellow-man\r\nwhom he has profoundly loved and reverenced, will lightly say that the\r\nshock can leave the faith in the Invisible Goodness unshaken. With the\r\nsinking of high human trust, the dignity of life sinks too; we cease to\r\nbelieve in our own better self, since that also is part of the common\r\nnature which is degraded in our thought; and all the finer impulses of\r\nthe soul are dulled. Romola felt even the springs of her once active\r\npity drying up, and leaving her to barren egoistic complaining. Had not\r\n_she_ had her sorrows too? And few had cared for her, while she had\r\ncared for many. She had done enough; she had striven after the\r\nimpossible, and was weary of this stifling crowded life. She longed for\r\nthat repose in mere sensation which she had sometimes dreamed of in the\r\nsultry afternoons of her early girlhood, when she had fancied herself\r\nfloating na\xc3\xafad-like in the waters.\r\n\r\nThe clear waves seemed to invite her: she wished she could lie down to\r\nsleep on them and pass from sleep into death. But Romola could not\r\ndirectly seek death; the fulness of young life in her forbade that. She\r\ncould only wish that death would come.\r\n\r\nAt the spot where she had paused there was a deep bend in the shore,\r\nand a small boat with a sail was moored there. In her longing to glide\r\nover the waters that were getting golden with the level sun-rays, she\r\nthought of a story which had been one of the things she had loved to\r\ndwell on in Boccaccio, when her father fell asleep and she glided from\r\nher stool to sit on the floor and read the \xe2\x80\x98Decamerone.\xe2\x80\x99 It was the\r\nstory of that fair Gostanza who in her lovelorn-ness desired to live no\r\nlonger, but not having the courage to attack her young life, had put\r\nherself into a boat and pushed off to sea; then, lying down in the\r\nboat, had wrapt her mantle round her head, hoping to be wrecked, so\r\nthat her fear would be helpless to flee from death. The memory had\r\nremained a mere thought in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s mind, without budding into any\r\ndistinct wish; but now, as she paused again in her walking to and fro,\r\nshe saw gliding black against the red gold another boat with one man in\r\nit, making towards the bend where the first and smaller boat was\r\nmoored. Walking on again, she at length saw the man land, pull his boat\r\nashore and begin to unload something from it. He was perhaps the owner\r\nof the smaller boat also: he would be going away soon, and her\r\nopportunity would be gone with him\xe2\x80\x94her opportunity of buying that\r\nsmaller boat. She had not yet admitted to herself that she meant to use\r\nit, but she felt a sudden eagerness to secure the possibility of using\r\nit, which disclosed the half-unconscious growth of a thought into a\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that little boat yours also?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the fisherman, who had\r\nlooked up, a little startled by the tall grey figure, and had made a\r\nreverence to this holy Sister wandering thus mysteriously in the\r\nevening solitude.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ his boat; an old one, hardly seaworthy, yet worth repairing to\r\nany man who would buy it. By the blessing of San Antonio, whose chapel\r\nwas in the village yonder, his fishing had prospered, and he had now a\r\nbetter boat, which had once been Gianni\xe2\x80\x99s who died. But he had not yet\r\nsold the old one. Romola asked him how much it was worth, and then,\r\nwhile he was busy, thrust the price into a little satchel lying on the\r\nground and containing the remnant of his dinner. After that, she\r\nwatched him furling his sail and asked him how he should set it if he\r\nwanted to go out to sea, and then pacing up and down again, waited to\r\nsee him depart.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of herself gliding away in that boat on the darkening\r\nwaters was growing more and more into a longing, as the thought of a\r\ncool brook in sultriness becomes a painful thirst. To be freed from the\r\nburden of choice when all motive was bruised, to commit herself,\r\nsleeping, to destiny which would either bring death or else new\r\nnecessities that might rouse a new life in her!\xe2\x80\x94it was a thought that\r\nbeckoned her the more because the soft evening air made her long to\r\nrest in the still solitude, instead of going back to the noise and heat\r\nof the village.\r\n\r\nAt last the slow fisherman had gathered up all his movables and was\r\nwalking away. Soon the gold was shrinking and getting duskier in sea\r\nand sky, and there was no living thing in sight, no sound but the\r\nlulling monotony of the lapping waves. In this sea there was no tide\r\nthat would help to carry her away if she waited for its ebb; but Romola\r\nthought the breeze from the land was rising a little. She got into the\r\nboat, unfurled the sail, and fastened it as she had learned in that\r\nfirst brief lesson. She saw that it caught the light breeze, and this\r\nwas all she cared for. Then she loosed the boat from its moorings, and\r\ntried to urge it with an oar, till she was far out from the land, till\r\nthe sea was dark even to the west, and the stars were disclosing\r\nthemselves like a palpitating life over the wide heavens. Resting at\r\nlast, she threw back her cowl, and, taking off the kerchief underneath,\r\nwhich confined her hair, she doubled them both under her head for a\r\npillow on one of the boat\xe2\x80\x99s ribs. The fair head was still very young\r\nand could bear a hard pillow.\r\n\r\nAnd so she lay, with the soft night air breathing on her while she\r\nglided on the water and watched the deepening quiet of the sky. She was\r\nalone now: she had freed herself from all claims, she had freed herself\r\neven from that burden of choice which presses with heavier and heavier\r\nweight when claims have loosed their guiding hold.\r\n\r\nHad she found anything like the dream of her girlhood? No. Memories\r\nhung upon her like the weight of broken wings that could never be\r\nlifted\xe2\x80\x94memories of human sympathy which even in its pains leaves a\r\nthirst that the Great Mother has no milk to still. Romola felt orphaned\r\nin those wide spaces of sea and sky. She read no message of love for\r\nher in that far-off symbolic writing of the heavens, and with a great\r\nsob she wished that she might be gliding into death.\r\n\r\nShe drew the cowl over her head again and covered her face, choosing\r\ndarkness rather than the light of the stars, which seemed to her like\r\nthe hard light of eyes that looked at her without seeing her. Presently\r\nshe felt that she was in the grave, but not resting there: she was\r\ntouching the hands of the beloved dead beside her, and trying to wake\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\nThe Benediction.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the morning of the twenty-seventh of February the\r\ncurrents of passengers along the Florentine streets set decidedly\r\ntowards San Marco. It was the last morning of the Carnival, and every\r\none knew there was a second Bonfire of Vanities being prepared in front\r\nof the Old Palace; but at this hour it was evident that the centre of\r\npopular interest lay elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Piazza di San Marco was filled by a multitude who showed no other\r\nmovement than that which proceeded from the pressure of new-comers\r\ntrying to force their way forward from all the openings: but the front\r\nranks were already close-serried and resisted the pressure. Those ranks\r\nwere ranged around a semicircular barrier in front of the church, and\r\nwithin this barrier were already assembling the Dominican Brethren of\r\nSan Marco.\r\n\r\nBut the temporary wooden pulpit erected over the church-door was still\r\nempty. It was presently to be entered by the man whom the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommand had banished from the pulpit of the Duomo, whom the other\r\necclesiastics of Florence had been forbidden to consort with, whom the\r\ncitizens had been forbidden to hear on pain of excommunication. This\r\nman had said, \xe2\x80\x9cA wicked, unbelieving Pope who has gained the pontifical\r\nchair by bribery is not Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Vicar. His curses are broken swords:\r\nhe grasps a hilt without a blade. His commands are contrary to the\r\nChristian life: it is lawful to disobey them\xe2\x80\x94nay, _it is not lawful to\r\nobey them_.\xe2\x80\x9d And the people still flocked to hear him as he preached in\r\nhis own church of San Marco, though the Pope was hanging terrible\r\nthreats over Florence if it did not renounce the pestilential\r\nschismatic and send him to Rome to be \xe2\x80\x9cconverted\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94still, as on this\r\nvery morning, accepted the Communion from his excommunicated hands. For\r\nhow if this Frate had really more command over the Divine lightnings\r\nthan that official successor of Saint Peter? It was a momentous\r\nquestion, which for the mass of citizens could never be decided by the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate test, namely, what was and what was not accordant with\r\nthe highest spiritual law. No: in such a case as this, if God had\r\nchosen the Frate as his prophet to rebuke the High Priest who carried\r\nthe mystic raiment unworthily, he would attest his choice by some\r\nunmistakable sign. As long as the belief in the Prophet carried no\r\nthreat of outward calamity, but rather the confident hope of\r\nexceptional safety, no sign was needed: his preaching was a music to\r\nwhich the people felt themselves marching along the way they wished to\r\ngo; but now that belief meant an immediate blow to their commerce, the\r\nshaking of their position among the Italian States, and an interdict on\r\ntheir city, there inevitably came the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat miracle showest\r\nthou?\xe2\x80\x9d Slowly at first, then faster and faster, that fatal demand had\r\nbeen swelling in Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s ear, provoking a response, outwardly in\r\nthe declaration that at the fitting time the miracle would come;\r\ninwardly in the faith\xe2\x80\x94not unwavering, for what faith is so?\xe2\x80\x94that if the\r\nneed for miracle became urgent, the work he had before him was too\r\ngreat for the Divine power to leave it halting. His faith wavered, but\r\nnot his speech: it is the lot of every man who has to speak for the\r\nsatisfaction of the crowd, that he must often speak in virtue of\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s faith, hoping it will come back to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIt was in preparation for a scene which was really a response to the\r\npopular impatience for some supernatural guarantee of the Prophet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmission, that the wooden pulpit had been erected above the church-door.\r\nBut while the ordinary Frati in black mantles were entering and\r\narranging themselves, the faces of the multitude were not yet eagerly\r\ndirected towards the pulpit: it was felt that Savonarola would not\r\nappear just yet, and there was some interest in singling out the\r\nvarious monks, some of them belonging to high Florentine families, many\r\nof them having fathers, brothers, or cousins among the artisans and\r\nshopkeepers who made the majority of the crowd. It was not till the\r\ntale of monks was complete, not till they had fluttered their books and\r\nhad begun to chant, that people said to each other, \xe2\x80\x9cFra Girolamo must\r\nbe coming now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat expectation rather than any spell from the accustomed wail of\r\npsalmody was what made silence and expectation seem to spread like a\r\npaling solemn light over the multitude of upturned faces, all now\r\ndirected towards the empty pulpit.\r\n\r\nThe next instant the pulpit was no longer empty. A figure covered from\r\nhead to foot in black cowl and mantle had entered it, and was kneeling\r\nwith bent head and with face turned away. It seemed a weary time to the\r\neager people while the black figure knelt and the monks chanted. But\r\nthe stillness was not broken, for the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s audiences with Heaven\r\nwere yet charged with electric awe for that mixed multitude, so that\r\nthose who had already the will to stone him felt their arms unnerved.\r\n\r\nAt last there was a vibration among the multitude, each seeming to give\r\nhis neighbour a momentary aspen-like touch, as when men who have been\r\nwatching for something in the heavens see the expected presence\r\nsilently disclosing itself. The Frate had risen, turned towards the\r\npeople, and partly pushed back his cowl. The monotonous wail of\r\npsalmody had ceased, and to those who stood near the pulpit, it was as\r\nif the sounds which had just been filling their ears had suddenly\r\nmerged themselves in the force of Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s flashing glance, as he\r\nlooked round him in the silence. Then he stretched out his hands,\r\nwhich, in their exquisite delicacy, seemed transfigured from an animal\r\norgan for grasping into vehicles of sensibility too acute to need any\r\ngross contact: hands that came like an appealing speech from that part\r\nof his soul which was masked by his strong passionate face, written on\r\nnow with deeper lines about the mouth and brow than are made by\r\nforty-four years of ordinary life.\r\n\r\nAt the first stretching out of the hands some of the crowd in the front\r\nranks fell on their knees, and here and there a devout disciple farther\r\noff; but the great majority stood firm, some resisting the impulse to\r\nkneel before this excommunicated man (might not a great judgment fall\r\nupon him even in this act of blessing?)\xe2\x80\x94others jarred with scorn and\r\nhatred of the ambitious deceiver who was getting up this new comedy,\r\nbefore which, nevertheless, they felt themselves impotent, as before\r\nthe triumph of a fashion.\r\n\r\nBut then came the voice, clear and low at first, uttering the words of\r\nabsolution\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Misereatur vestri_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and more fell on their knees: and as\r\nit rose higher and yet clearer, the erect heads became fewer and fewer,\r\ntill, at the words \xe2\x80\x9c_Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus_\xe2\x80\x9d it rose to a\r\nmasculine cry, as if protesting its power to bless under the clutch of\r\na demon that wanted to stifle it: it rang like a trumpet to the\r\nextremities of the Piazza, and under it every head was bowed.\r\n\r\nAfter the utterance of that blessing, Savonarola himself fell on his\r\nknees and hid his face in temporary exhaustion. Those great jets of\r\nemotion were a necessary part of his life; he himself had said to the\r\npeople long ago, \xe2\x80\x9cWithout preaching I cannot live.\xe2\x80\x9d But it was a life\r\nthat shattered him.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more, some had risen to their feet, but a larger\r\nnumber remained kneeling, and all faces were intently watching him. He\r\nhad taken into his hands a crystal vessel, containing the consecrated\r\nHost, and was about to address the people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember, my children, three days ago I besought you, when I\r\nshould hold this Sacrament in my hand in the face of you all, to pray\r\nfervently to the Most High that if this work of mine does not come from\r\nHim, He will send a fire and consume me, that I may vanish into the\r\neternal darkness away from His light which I have hidden with my\r\nfalsity. Again I beseech you to make that prayer, and to make it\r\n_now_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a breathless moment: perhaps no man really prayed, if some in a\r\nspirit of devout obedience made the effort to pray. Every consciousness\r\nwas chiefly possessed by the sense that Savonarola was praying, in a\r\nvoice not loud, but distinctly audible in the wide stillness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, if I have not wrought in sincerity of soul, if my word cometh\r\nnot from Thee, strike me in this moment with Thy thunder, and let the\r\nfires of Thy wrath enclose me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased to speak, and stood motionless, with the consecrated Mystery\r\nin his hand, with eyes uplifted, and a quivering excitement in his\r\nwhole aspect. Every one else was motionless and silent too, while the\r\nsunlight, which for the last quarter of an hour had here and there been\r\npiercing the greyness, made fitful streaks across the convent wall,\r\ncausing some awe-stricken spectators to start timidly. But soon there\r\nwas a wider parting, and with a gentle quickness, like a smile, a\r\nstream of brightness poured itself on the crystal vase, and then spread\r\nitself over Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s face with mild glorification.\r\n\r\nAn instantaneous shout rang through the Piazza, \xe2\x80\x9cBehold the answer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe warm radiance thrilled through Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s frame, and so did the\r\nshout. It was his last moment of untroubled triumph, and in its\r\nrapturous confidence he felt carried to a grander scene yet to come,\r\nbefore an audience that would represent all Christendom, in whose\r\npresence he should again be sealed as the messenger of the supreme\r\nrighteousness, and feel himself full charged with Divine strength. It\r\nwas but a moment that expanded itself in that prevision. While the\r\nshout was still ringing in his ears he turned away within the church,\r\nfeeling the strain too great for him to bear it longer.\r\n\r\nBut when the Frate had disappeared, and the sunlight seemed no longer\r\nto have anything special in its illumination, but was spreading itself\r\nimpartially over all things clean and unclean, there began, along with\r\nthe general movement of the crowd, a confusion of voices in which\r\ncertain strong discords and varying scales of laughter made it evident\r\nthat, in the previous silence and universal kneeling, hostility and\r\nscorn had only submitted unwillingly to a momentary spell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me the plaudits are giving way to criticism,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito,\r\nwho had been watching the scene attentively from an upper loggia in one\r\nof the houses opposite the church. \xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless it was a striking\r\nmoment, eh, Messer Pietro? Fra Girolamo is a man to make one understand\r\nthat there was a time when the monk\xe2\x80\x99s frock was a symbol of power over\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s minds rather than over the keys of women\xe2\x80\x99s cupboards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pietro Cennini. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd until I have seen proof that Fra\r\nGirolamo has much less faith in God\xe2\x80\x99s judgments than the common run of\r\nmen, instead of having considerably more, I shall not believe that he\r\nwould brave Heaven in this way if his soul were laden with a conscious\r\nlie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\nRipening Schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA month after that Carnival, one morning near the end of March, Tito\r\ndescended the marble steps of the Old Palace, bound on a pregnant\r\nerrand to San Marco. For some reason, he did not choose to take the\r\ndirect road, which was but a slightly-bent line from the Old Palace; he\r\nchose rather to make a circuit by the Piazza di Santa Croce, where the\r\npeople would be pouring out of the church after the early sermon.\r\n\r\nIt was in the grand church of Santa Croce that the daily Lenten sermon\r\nhad of late had the largest audience. For Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s voice had ceased\r\nto be heard even in his own church of San Marco, a hostile Signoria\r\nhaving imposed silence on him in obedience to a new letter from the\r\nPope, threatening the city with an immediate interdict if this\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwretched worm\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmonstrous idol\xe2\x80\x9d were not forbidden to preach, and\r\nsent to demand pardon at Rome. And next to hearing Fra Girolamo\r\nhimself, the most exciting Lenten occupation was to hear him argued\r\nagainst and vilified. This excitement was to be had in Santa Croce,\r\nwhere the Franciscan appointed to preach the Quaresimal sermons had\r\noffered to clench his arguments by walking through the fire with Fra\r\nGirolamo. Had not that schismatical Dominican said, that his prophetic\r\ndoctrine would be proved by a miracle at the fitting time? Here, then,\r\nwas the fitting time. Let Savonarola walk through the fire, and if he\r\ncame out unhurt, the Divine origin of his doctrine would be\r\ndemonstrated; but if the fire consumed him, his falsity would be\r\nmanifest; and that he might have no excuse for evading the test, the\r\nFranciscan declared himself willing to be a victim to this high logic,\r\nand to be burned for the sake of securing the necessary minor premiss.\r\n\r\nSavonarola, according to his habit, had taken no notice of these pulpit\r\nattacks. But it happened that the zealous preacher of Santa Croce was\r\nno other than the Fra Francesco di Puglia, who at Prato the year before\r\nhad been engaged in a like challenge with Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s fervent follower\r\nFra Domenico, but had been called home by his superiors while the heat\r\nwas simply oratorical. Honest Fra Domenico, then, who was preaching\r\nLenten sermons to the women in the Via del Cocomero, no sooner heard of\r\nthis new challenge, than he took up the gauntlet for his master, and\r\ndeclared himself ready to walk through the fire with Fra Francesco.\r\nAlready the people were beginning to take a strong interest in what\r\nseemed to them a short and easy method of argument (for those who were\r\nto be convinced), when Savonarola, keenly alive to the dangers that lay\r\nin the mere discussion of the case, commanded Fra Domenico to withdraw\r\nhis acceptance of the challenge and secede from the affair. The\r\nFranciscan declared himself content: he had not directed his challenge\r\nto any subaltern, but to Fra Girolamo himself.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the popular interest in the Lenten sermons had flagged a\r\nlittle. But this morning, when Tito entered the Piazza di Santa Croce,\r\nhe found, as he expected, that the people were pouring from the church\r\nin large numbers. Instead of dispersing, many of them concentrated\r\nthemselves towards a particular spot near the entrance of the\r\nFranciscan monastery, and Tito took the same direction, threading the\r\ncrowd with a careless and leisurely air, but keeping careful watch on\r\nthat monastic entrance, as if he expected some object of interest to\r\nissue from it.\r\n\r\nIt was no such expectation that occupied the crowd. The object they\r\nwere caring about was already visible to them in the shape of a large\r\nplacard, affixed by order of the Signoria, and covered with very\r\nlegible official handwriting. But curiosity was somewhat balked by the\r\nfact that the manuscript was chiefly in Latin, and though nearly every\r\nman knew beforehand approximately what the placard contained, he had an\r\nappetite for more exact knowledge, which gave him an irritating sense\r\nof his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance in not being able to interpret the learned\r\ntongue. For that aural acquaintance with Latin phrases which the\r\nunlearned might pick up from pulpit quotations constantly interpreted\r\nby the preacher could help them little when they saw written Latin; the\r\nspelling even of the modern language being in an unorganised and\r\nscrambling condition for the mass of people who could read and\r\nwrite,[1] while the majority of those assembled nearest to the placard\r\nwere not in the dangerous predicament of possessing that little\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n [1] The old diarists throw in their consonants with a regard rather to\r\n quantity than position, well typified by the _Ragnolo Braghiello_\r\n (Agnolo Gabriello) of Boccaccio\xe2\x80\x99s Ferondo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s doctrines that he\xe2\x80\x99s to prove by being burned,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthat large public character Goro, who happened to be among the foremost\r\ngazers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Signoria has taken it in hand, and the writing is to let\r\nus know. It\xe2\x80\x99s what the Padre has been telling us about in his sermon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Goro,\xe2\x80\x9d said a sleek shopkeeper, compassionately, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast got\r\nthy legs into twisted hose there. The Frate has to prove his doctrines\r\nby _not_ being burned: he is to walk through the fire, and come out on\r\nthe other side sound and whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young sculptor, who wore his white-streaked cap and\r\ntunic with a jaunty air. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Fra Girolamo objects to walking through\r\nthe fire. Being sound and whole already, he sees no reason why he\r\nshould walk through the fire to come out in just the same condition. He\r\nleaves such odds and ends of work to Fra Domenico.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I say he flinches like a coward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Goro, in a wheezy treble.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuffocation! that was what he did at the Carnival. He had us all in\r\nthe Piazza to see the lightning strike him, and nothing came of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop that bleating,\xe2\x80\x9d said a tall shoemaker, who had stepped in to hear\r\npart of the sermon, with bunches of slippers hanging over his\r\nshoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, friend, that you are about as wise as a\r\ncalf with water on its brain. The Frate will flinch from nothing: he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsay nothing beforehand, perhaps, but when the moment comes he\xe2\x80\x99ll walk\r\nthrough the fire without asking any grey-frock to keep him company. But\r\nI would give a shoestring to know what this Latin all is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s so much of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper, \xe2\x80\x9celse I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty good at\r\nguessing. Is there no scholar to be seen?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a slight\r\nexpression of disgust.\r\n\r\nThere was a general turning of heads, which caused the talkers to\r\ndescry Tito approaching in their rear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young sculptor, smiling and raising his cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the secretary of the Ten: he is going to the convent, doubtless;\r\nmake way for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper, also doffing, though that mark\r\nof respect was rarely shown by Florentines except to the highest\r\nofficials. The exceptional reverence was really exacted by the\r\nsplendour and grace of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, which made his black mantle,\r\nwith its gold fibula, look like a regal robe, and his ordinary black\r\nvelvet cap like an entirely exceptional head-dress. The hardening of\r\nhis cheeks and mouth, which was the chief change in his face since he\r\ncame to Florence, seemed to a superficial glance only to give his\r\nbeauty a more masculine character. He raised his own cap immediately\r\nand said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my friend, I merely wished, as you did, to see what is at the\r\nfoot of this placard\xe2\x80\x94ah, it is as I expected. I had been informed that\r\nthe government permits any one who will, to subscribe his name as a\r\ncandidate to enter the fire\xe2\x80\x94which is an act of liberality worthy of the\r\nmagnificent Signoria\xe2\x80\x94reserving of course the right to make a selection.\r\nAnd doubtless many believers will be eager to subscribe their names.\r\nFor what is it to enter the fire, to one whose faith is firm? A man is\r\nafraid of the fire, because he believes it will burn him; but if he\r\nbelieves the contrary?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Tito lifted his shoulders and made an\r\noratorical pause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor which reason I have never been one to disbelieve\r\nthe Frate, when he has said that he would enter the fire to prove his\r\ndoctrine. For in his place, if you believed the fire would not burn\r\nyou, which of you, my friends, would not enter it as readily as you\r\nwould walk along the dry bed of the Mugnone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Tito looked round him during this appeal, there was a change in some\r\nof his audience very much like the change in an eager dog when he is\r\ninvited to smell something pungent. Since the question of burning was\r\nbecoming practical, it was not every one who would rashly commit\r\nhimself to any general view of the relation between faith and fire. The\r\nscene might have been too much for a gravity less under command than\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Messer Segretario,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young sculptor, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to me Fra\r\nFrancesco is the greater hero, for he offers to enter the fire for the\r\ntruth, though he is sure the fire will burn him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if it turns out that Fra\r\nFrancesco is mistaken, he will have been burned for the wrong side, and\r\nthe Church has never reckoned such victims to be martyrs. We must\r\nsuspend our judgment until the trial has really taken place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, Messer Segretario,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper, with subdued\r\nimpatience. \xe2\x80\x9cBut will you favour us by interpreting the Latin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does but express the conclusions or\r\ndoctrines which the Frate specially teaches, and which the trial by\r\nfire is to prove true or false. They are doubtless familiar to you.\r\nFirst, that Florence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us have the Latin bit by bit, and then tell us what it means,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the shoemaker, who had been a frequent hearer of Fra Girolamo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will then judge if I give you the\r\nright meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; that\xe2\x80\x99s fair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Goro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ecclesia Dei indiget renovatione_; that is, the Church of God needs\r\npurifying or regenerating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means, the priests ought to lead better lives; there needs no\r\nmiracle to prove that. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Frate has always been saying,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the shoemaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Flagellabitur_,\xe2\x80\x9d Tito went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, it will be scourged.\r\n_Renovabitur_: it will be purified. _Florentia quoque post flagellam\r\nrenovabitur et prosperabitur_: Florence also, after the scourging,\r\nshall be purified and shall prosper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means we are to get Pisa again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd get the wool from England as we used to do, I should hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nan elderly man, in an old-fashioned berretta, who had been silent till\r\nnow. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been scourging enough with the sinking of the trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a tall personage, surmounted by a red feather, issued\r\nfrom the door of the convent, and exchanged an indifferent glance with\r\nTito; who, tossing his becchetto carelessly over his left shoulder,\r\nturned to his reading again, while the bystanders, with more timidity\r\nthan respect, shrank to make a passage for Messer Dolfo Spini.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Infideles convertentur ad Christum_,\xe2\x80\x9d Tito went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, the\r\ninfidels shall be converted to Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are the Turks and the Moors. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to say against\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper, dispassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Haec autem omnia erunt temporibus nostris_: and all these things\r\nshall happen in our times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what use would they be else?\xe2\x80\x9d said Goro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Excommunicato nuper lata contra Reverendum Patrem nostrum Fratrem\r\nHieronymum nulla est_: the excommunication lately pronounced against\r\nour reverend father, Fra Girolamo, is null. _Non observantes eam non\r\npeccant_: those who disregard it are not committing a sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall know better what to say to that when we have had the Trial by\r\nFire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich doubtless will clear up everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all the\r\nLatin\xe2\x80\x94all the conclusions that are to be proved true or false by the\r\ntrial. The rest you can perceive is simply a proclamation of the\r\nSignoria in good Tuscan, calling on such as are eager to walk through\r\nthe fire, to come to the Palazzo and subscribe their names. Can I serve\r\nyou further? If not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito, as he turned away, raised his cap and bent slightly, with so easy\r\nan air that the movement seemed a natural prompting of deference.\r\n\r\nHe quickened his pace as he left the Piazza, and after two or three\r\nturnings he paused in a quiet street before a door at which he gave a\r\nlight and peculiar knock. It was opened by a young woman whom he\r\nchucked under the chin as he asked her if the Padrone was within, and\r\nhe then passed, without further ceremony, through another door which\r\nstood ajar on his right-hand. It admitted him into a handsome but\r\nuntidy room, where Dolfo Spini sat playing with a fine stag-hound which\r\nalternately snuffed at a basket of pups and licked his hands with that\r\naffectionate disregard of her master\xe2\x80\x99s morals sometimes held to be one\r\nof the most agreeable attributes of her sex. He just looked up as Tito\r\nentered, but continued his play, simply from that disposition to\r\npersistence in some irrelevant action, by which slow-witted sensual\r\npeople seem to be continually counteracting their own purposes. Tito\r\nwas patient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA handsome _bracca_ that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly, standing with his thumbs\r\nin his belt. Presently he added, in that cool liquid tone which seemed\r\nmild, but compelled attention, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have finished such caresses as\r\ncannot possibly be deferred, my Dolfo, we will talk of business, if you\r\nplease. My time, which I could wish to be eternity at your service, is\r\nnot entirely my own this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown, Mischief, down!\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini, with sudden roughness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMalediction!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, still more gruffly, pushing the dog aside;\r\nthen, starting from his seat, he stood close to Tito, and put a hand on\r\nhis shoulder as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope your sharp wits see all the ins and outs of this business, my\r\nfine necromancer, for it seems to me no clearer than the bottom of a\r\nsack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your difficulty, my cavalier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese accursed Frati Minori at Santa Croce. They are drawing back now.\r\nFra Francesco himself seems afraid of sticking to his challenge; talks\r\nof the Prophet being likely to use magic to get up a false\r\nmiracle\xe2\x80\x94thinks he himself might be dragged into the fire and burned,\r\nand the Prophet might come out whole by magic, and the Church be none\r\nthe better. And then, after all our talking, there\xe2\x80\x99s not so much as a\r\nblessed lay brother who will offer himself to pair with that pious\r\nsheep Fra Domenico.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the peculiar stupidity of the tonsured skull that prevents them\r\nfrom seeing of how little consequence it is whether they are burned or\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you sworn well to them that they shall be in no\r\ndanger of entering the fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini, looking puzzled; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause one of them will be obliged\r\nto go in with Fra Domenico, who thinks it a thousand years till the\r\nfagots are ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Fra Domenico himself is not likely to go in. I have told\r\nyou before, my Dolfo, only your powerful mind is not to be impressed\r\nwithout more repetition than suffices for the vulgar\xe2\x80\x94I have told you\r\nthat now you have got the Signoria to take up this affair and prevent\r\nit from being hushed up by Fra Girolamo, nothing is necessary but that\r\non a given day the fuel should be prepared in the Piazza, and the\r\npeople got together with the expectation of seeing something\r\nprodigious. If, after that, the Prophet quits the Piazza without any\r\nappearance of a miracle on his side, he is ruined with the people: they\r\nwill be ready to pelt him out of the city, the Signoria will find it\r\neasy to banish him from the territory, and his Holiness may do as he\r\nlikes with him. Therefore, my Alcibiades, swear to the Franciscans that\r\ntheir grey-frocks shall not come within singeing distance of the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpini rubbed the back of his head with one hand, and tapped his sword\r\nagainst his leg with the other, to stimulate his power of seeing these\r\nintangible combinations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently, looking up again, \xe2\x80\x9cunless we fall on him in\r\nthe Piazza, when the people are in a rage, and make an end of him and\r\nhis lies then and there, Valori and the Salviati and the Albizzi will\r\ntake up arms and raise a fight for him. I know that was talked of when\r\nthere was the hubbub on Ascension Sunday. And the people may turn round\r\nagain: there may be a story raised of the French king coming again, or\r\nsome other cursed chance in the hypocrite\xe2\x80\x99s favour. The city will never\r\nbe safe till he\xe2\x80\x99s out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _will_ be out of it before long, without your giving yourself any\r\nfurther trouble than this little comedy of the Trial by Fire. The wine\r\nand the sun will make vinegar without any shouting to help them, as\r\nyour Florentine sages would say. You will have the satisfaction of\r\ndelivering your city from an incubus by an able stratagem, instead of\r\nrisking blunders with sword-thrusts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose he _did_ get magic and the devil to help him, and walk\r\nthrough the fire after all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini, with a grimace intended to\r\nhide a certain shyness in trenching on this speculative ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do\r\nyou know there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in those things? Plenty of scholars believe in\r\nthem, and this Frate is bad enough for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course there are such things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with a shrug: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nhave particular reasons for knowing that the Frate is not on such terms\r\nwith the devil as can give him any confidence in this affair. The only\r\nmagic he relies on is his own ability.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbility!\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call it ability to be setting Florence\r\nat loggerheads with the Pope and all the powers of Italy\xe2\x80\x94all to keep\r\nbeckoning at the French king who never comes? You may call him able,\r\nbut I call him a hypocrite, who wants to be master of everybody, and\r\nget himself made Pope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou judge with your usual penetration, my captain, but our opinions do\r\nnot clash. The Frate, wanting to be master, and to carry out his\r\nprojects against the Pope, requires the lever of a foreign power, and\r\nrequires Florence as a fulcrum. I used to think him a narrow-minded\r\nbigot, but now, I think him a shrewd ambitious man who knows what he is\r\naiming at, and directs his aim as skilfully as you direct a ball when\r\nyou are playing at _maglio_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini, cordially, \xe2\x80\x9cI can aim a ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, with bland gravity; \xe2\x80\x9cand I should not have\r\ntroubled you with my trivial remark on the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s ability, but that\r\nyou may see how this will heighten the credit of your success against\r\nhim at Rome and at Milan, which is sure to serve you in good stead when\r\nthe city comes to change its policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thou art a good little demon, and shalt have good pay,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSpini, patronisingly; whereupon he thought it only natural that the\r\nuseful Greek adventurer should smile with gratification as he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, any advantage to me depends entirely on your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have our supper at my palace to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Spini,\r\nwith a significant nod and an affectionate pat on Tito\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI shall expound the new scheme to them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, my magnificent patron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito; \xe2\x80\x9cthe scheme has been the\r\nsame from the first\xe2\x80\x94it has never varied except in your memory. Are you\r\nsure you have fast hold of it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpini rehearsed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as Tito was hastening away. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is that\r\nsharp-nosed notary, Ser Ceccone; he has been handy of late. Tell me,\r\nyou who can see a man wink when you\xe2\x80\x99re behind him, do you think I may\r\ngo on making use of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito dared not say \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d He knew his companion too well to trust him\r\nwith advice when all Spini\xe2\x80\x99s vanity and self-interest were not engaged\r\nin concealing the adviser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say against\r\nCeccone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat suggestion of the notary\xe2\x80\x99s intimate access to Spini caused Tito a\r\npassing twinge, interrupting his amused satisfaction in the success\r\nwith which he made a tool of the man who fancied himself a patron. For\r\nhe had been rather afraid of Ser Ceccone. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s nature made him\r\npeculiarly alive to circumstances that might be turned to his\r\ndisadvantage; his memory was much haunted by such possibilities,\r\nstimulating him to contrivances by which he might ward them off. And it\r\nwas not likely that he should forget that October morning more than a\r\nyear ago, when Romola had appeared suddenly before him at the door of\r\nNello\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and had compelled him to declare his certainty that Fra\r\nGirolamo was not going outside the gates. The fact that Ser Ceccone had\r\nbeen a witness of that scene, together with Tito\xe2\x80\x99s perception that for\r\nsome reason or other he was an object of dislike to the notary, had\r\nreceived a new importance from the recent turn of events. For after\r\nhaving been implicated in the Medicean plots, and having found it\r\nadvisable in consequence to retire into the country for some time, Ser\r\nCeccone had of late, since his reappearance in the city, attached\r\nhimself to the Arrabbiati, and cultivated the patronage of Dolfo Spini.\r\nNow that captain of the Compagnacci was much given, when in the company\r\nof intimates, to confidential narrative about his own doings, and if\r\nSer Ceccone\xe2\x80\x99s powers of combination were sharpened by enmity, he might\r\ngather some knowledge which he could use against Tito with very\r\nunpleasant results.\r\n\r\nIt would be pitiable to be balked in well-conducted schemes by an\r\ninsignificant notary; to be lamed by the sting of an insect whom he had\r\noffended unawares. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d Tito said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe man\xe2\x80\x99s dislike to\r\nme can be nothing deeper than the ill-humour of a dinnerless dog; I\r\nshall conquer it if I can make him prosperous.\xe2\x80\x9d And he had been very\r\nglad of an opportunity which had presented itself of providing the\r\nnotary with a temporary post as an extra _cancelliere_ or registering\r\nsecretary under the Ten, believing that with this sop and the\r\nexpectation of more, the waspish cur must be quite cured of the\r\ndisposition to bite him.\r\n\r\nBut perfect scheming demands omniscience, and the notary\xe2\x80\x99s envy had\r\nbeen stimulated into hatred by causes of which Tito knew nothing. That\r\nevening when Tito, returning from his critical audience with the\r\nSpecial Council, had brushed by Ser Ceccone on the stairs, the notary,\r\nwho had only just returned from Pistoja, and learned the arrest of the\r\nconspirators, was bound on an errand which bore a humble resemblance to\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s. He also, without giving up a show of popular zeal, had been\r\nputting in the Medicean lottery. He also had been privy to the\r\nunexecuted plot, and was willing to tell what he knew, but knew much\r\nless to tell. He also would have been willing to go on treacherous\r\nerrands, but a more eligible agent had forestalled him. His\r\npropositions were received coldly; the council, he was told, was\r\nalready in possession of the needed information, and since he had been\r\nthus busy in sedition, it would be well for him to retire out of the\r\nway of mischief, otherwise the government might be obliged to take note\r\nof him. Ser Ceccone wanted no evidence to make him attribute his\r\nfailure to Tito, and his spite was the more bitter because the nature\r\nof the case compelled him to hold his peace about it. Nor was this the\r\nwhole of his grudge against the flourishing Melema. On issuing from his\r\nhiding-place, and attaching himself to the Arrabbiati, he had earned\r\nsome pay as one of the spies who reported information on Florentine\r\naffairs to the Milanese court; but his pay had been small,\r\nnotwithstanding his pains to write full letters, and he had lately been\r\napprised that his news was seldom more than a late and imperfect\r\nedition of what was known already. Now Ser Ceccone had no positive\r\nknowledge that Tito had an underhand connection with the Arrabbiati and\r\nthe Court of Milan, but he had a suspicion of which he chewed the cud\r\nwith as strong a sense of flavour as if it had been a certainty.\r\n\r\nThis fine-grown vigorous hatred could swallow the feeble opiate of\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s favours, and be as lively as ever after it. Why should Ser\r\nCeccone like Melema any the better for doing him favours? Doubtless the\r\nsuave secretary had his own ends to serve; and what right had he to the\r\nsuperior position which made it possible for him to show favour? But\r\nsince he had tuned his voice to flattery, Ser Ceccone would pitch his\r\nin the same key, and it remained to be seen who would win at the game\r\nof outwitting.\r\n\r\nTo have a mind well oiled with that sort of argument which prevents any\r\nclaim from grasping it, seems eminently convenient sometimes: only the\r\noil becomes objectionable when we find it anointing other minds on\r\nwhich we want to establish a hold.\r\n\r\nTito, however, not being quite omniscient, felt now no more than a\r\npassing twinge of uneasiness at the suggestion of Ser Ceccone\xe2\x80\x99s power\r\nto hurt him. It was only for a little while that he cared greatly about\r\nkeeping clear of suspicions and hostility. He was now playing his final\r\ngame in Florence, and the skill he was conscious of applying gave him a\r\npleasure in it even apart from the expected winnings. The errand on\r\nwhich he was sent to San Marco was a stroke in which he felt so much\r\nconfidence that he had already given notice to the Ten of his desire to\r\nresign his office at an indefinite period within the next month or two,\r\nand had obtained permission to make that resignation suddenly, if his\r\naffairs needed it, with the understanding that Niccol\xc3\xb2 Macchiavelli was\r\nto be his provisional substitute, if not his successor. He was acting\r\non hypothetic grounds, but this was the sort of action that had the\r\nkeenest interest for his diplomatic mind. From a combination of general\r\nknowledge concerning Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s purposes with diligently observed\r\ndetails he had framed a conjecture which he was about to verify by this\r\nvisit to San Marco. If he proved to be right, his game would be won,\r\nand he might soon turn his back on Florence. He looked eagerly towards\r\nthat consummation, for many circumstances besides his own weariness of\r\nthe place told him that it was time for him to be gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\nThe Prophet in his Cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTito\xe2\x80\x99s visit to San Marco had been announced beforehand, and he was at\r\nonce conducted by Fra Niccol\xc3\xb2, Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, up the spiral\r\nstaircase into the long corridors lined with cells\xe2\x80\x94corridors where Fra\r\nAngelico\xe2\x80\x99s frescoes, delicate as the rainbow on the melting cloud,\r\nstartled the unaccustomed eye here and there, as if they had been\r\nsudden reflections cast from an ethereal world, where the Madonna sat\r\ncrowned in her radiant glory, and the Divine infant looked forth with\r\nperpetual promise.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour of relaxation in the monastery, and most of the cells\r\nwere empty. The light through the narrow windows looked in on nothing\r\nbut bare walls, and the hard pallet and the crucifix. And even behind\r\nthat door at the end of a long corridor, in the inner cell opening from\r\nan antechamber where the Prior usually sat at his desk or received\r\nprivate visitors, the high jet of light fell on only one more object\r\nthat looked quite as common a monastic sight as the bare walls and hard\r\npallet. It was but the back of a figure in the long white Dominican\r\ntunic and scapulary, kneeling with bowed head before a crucifix. It\r\nmight have been any ordinary Fra Girolamo, who had nothing worse to\r\nconfess than thinking of wrong things when he was singing _in coro_, or\r\nfeeling a spiteful joy when Fra Benedetto dropped the ink over his own\r\nminiatures in the breviary he was illuminating\xe2\x80\x94who had no higher\r\nthought than that of climbing safely into Paradise up the narrow ladder\r\nof prayer, fasting, and obedience. But under this particular white\r\ntunic there was a heart beating with a consciousness inconceivable to\r\nthe average monk, and perhaps hard to be conceived by any man who has\r\nnot arrived at self-knowledge through a tumultuous inner life: a\r\nconsciousness in which irrevocable errors and lapses from veracity were\r\nso entwined with noble purposes and sincere beliefs, in which\r\nself-justifying expediency was so inwoven with the tissue of a great\r\nwork which the whole being seemed as unable to abandon as the body was\r\nunable to abandon glowing and trembling before the objects of hope and\r\nfear, that it was perhaps impossible, whatever course might be adopted,\r\nfor the conscience to find perfect repose.\r\n\r\nSavonarola was not only in the attitude of prayer, there were Latin\r\nwords of prayer on his lips; and yet he was not praying. He had entered\r\nhis cell, had fallen on his knees, and burst into words of\r\nsupplication, seeking in this way for an influx of calmness which would\r\nbe a warrant to him that the resolutions urged on him by crowding\r\nthoughts and passions were not wresting him away from the Divine\r\nsupport; but the previsions and impulses which had been at work within\r\nhim for the last hour were too imperious; and while he pressed his\r\nhands against his face, and while his lips were uttering audibly, \xe2\x80\x9c_Cor\r\nmundum crea in me_\xe2\x80\x9d his mind was still filled with the images of the\r\nsnare his enemies had prepared for him, was still busy with the\r\narguments by which he could justify himself against their taunts and\r\naccusations.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not only against his opponents that Savonarola had to defend\r\nhimself. This morning he had had new proof that his friends and\r\nfollowers were as much inclined to urge on the Trial by Fire as his\r\nenemies: desiring and tacitly expecting that he himself would at last\r\naccept the challenge and evoke the long-expected miracle which was to\r\ndissipate doubt and triumph over malignity. Had he not said that God\r\nwould declare himself at the fitting time? And to the understanding of\r\nplain Florentines, eager to get party questions settled, it seemed that\r\nno time could be more fitting than this. Certainly, if Fra Domenico\r\nwalked through the fire unhurt, _that_ would be a miracle, and the\r\nfaith and ardour of that good brother were felt to be a cheering\r\naugury; but Savonarola was acutely conscious that the secret longing of\r\nhis followers to see him accept the challenge had not been dissipated\r\nby any reasons he had given for his refusal.\r\n\r\nYet it was impossible to him to satisfy them; and with bitter distress\r\nhe saw now that it was impossible for him any longer to resist the\r\nprosecution of the trial in Fra Domenico\xe2\x80\x99s case. Not that Savonarola\r\nhad uttered and written a falsity when he declared his belief in a\r\nfuture supernatural attestation of his work; but his mind was so\r\nconstituted that while it was easy for him to believe in a miracle\r\nwhich, being distant and undefined, was screened behind the strong\r\nreasons he saw for its occurrence, and yet easier for him to have a\r\nbelief in inward miracles such as his own prophetic inspiration and\r\ndivinely-wrought intuitions; it was at the same time insurmountably\r\ndifficult to him to believe in the probability of a miracle which, like\r\nthis of being carried unhurt through the fire, pressed in all its\r\ndetails on his imagination and involved a demand not only for belief\r\nbut for exceptional action.\r\n\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s nature was one of those in which opposing tendencies\r\nco-exist in almost equal strength: the passionate sensibility which,\r\nimpatient of definite thought, floods every idea with emotion and tends\r\ntowards contemplative ecstasy, alternated in him with a keen perception\r\nof outward facts and a vigorous practical judgment of men and things.\r\nAnd in this case of the Trial by Fire, the latter characteristics were\r\nstimulated into unusual activity by an acute physical sensitiveness\r\nwhich gives overpowering force to the conception of pain and\r\ndestruction as a necessary sequence of facts which have already been\r\ncauses of pain in our experience. The promptitude with which men will\r\nconsent to touch red-hot iron with a wet finger is not to be measured\r\nby their theoretic acceptance of the impossibility that the iron will\r\nburn them: practical belief depends on what is most strongly\r\nrepresented in the mind at a given moment. And with the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstitution, when the Trial by Fire was urged on his imagination as an\r\nimmediate demand, it was impossible for him to believe that he or any\r\nother man could walk through the flames unhurt\xe2\x80\x94impossible for him to\r\nbelieve that even if he resolved to offer himself, he would not shrink\r\nat the last moment.\r\n\r\nBut the Florentines were not likely to make these fine distinctions. To\r\nthe common run of mankind it has always seemed a proof of mental vigour\r\nto find moral questions easy, and judge conduct according to concise\r\nalternatives. And nothing was likely to seem plainer than that a man\r\nwho at one time declared that God would not leave him without the\r\nguarantee of a miracle, and yet drew back when it was proposed to test\r\nhis declaration, had said what he did not believe. Were not Fra\r\nDomenico and Fra Mariano, and scores of Piagnoni besides, ready to\r\nenter the fire? What was the cause of their superior courage, if it was\r\nnot their superior faith? Savonarola could not have explained his\r\nconduct satisfactorily to his friends, even if he had been able to\r\nexplain it thoroughly to himself. And he was not. Our naked feelings\r\nmake haste to clothe themselves in propositions which lie at hand among\r\nour store of opinions, and to give a true account of what passes within\r\nus something else is necessary besides sincerity, even when sincerity\r\nis unmixed. In these very moments, when Savonarola was kneeling in\r\naudible prayer, he had ceased to hear the words on his lips. They were\r\ndrowned by argumentative voices within him that shaped their reasons\r\nmore and more for an outward audience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo appeal to heaven for a miracle by a rash acceptance of a challenge,\r\nwhich is a mere snare prepared for me by ignoble foes, would be a\r\ntempting of God, and the appeal would not be responded to. Let the\r\nPope\xe2\x80\x99s legate come, let the ambassadors of all the great Powers come\r\nand promise that the calling of a General Council and the reform of the\r\nChurch shall hang on the miracle, and I will enter the flames, trusting\r\nthat God will not withhold His seal from that great work. Until then I\r\nreserve myself for higher duties which are directly laid upon me: it is\r\nnot permitted to me to leap from the chariot for the sake of wrestling\r\nwith every loud vaunter. But Fra Domenico\xe2\x80\x99s invincible zeal to enter\r\ninto the trial may be the sign of a Divine vocation, may be a pledge\r\nthat the miracle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no! when Savonarola brought his mind close to the threatened scene\r\nin the Piazza, and imagined a human body entering the fire, his belief\r\nrecoiled again. It was not an event that his imagination could simply\r\nsee: he felt it with shuddering vibrations to the extremities of his\r\nsensitive fingers. The miracle could not be. Nay, the trial itself was\r\nnot to happen: he was warranted in doing all in his power to hinder it.\r\nThe fuel might be got ready in the Piazza, the people might be\r\nassembled, the preparatory formalities might be gone through: all this\r\nwas perhaps inevitable now, and he could no longer resist it without\r\nbringing dishonour on\xe2\x80\x94himself? Yes, and therefore on the cause of God.\r\nBut it was not really intended that the Franciscan should enter the\r\nfire, and while _he_ hung back there would be the means of preventing\r\nFra Domenico\xe2\x80\x99s entrance. At the very worst, if Fra Domenico were\r\ncompelled to enter, he should carry the consecrated Host with him, and\r\nwith that Mystery in his hand, there might be a warrant for expecting\r\nthat the ordinary effects of fire would be stayed; or, more probably,\r\nthis demand would be resisted, and might thus be a final obstacle to\r\nthe trial.\r\n\r\nBut these intentions could not be avowed: he must appear frankly to\r\nawait the trial, and to trust in its issue. That dissidence between\r\ninward reality and outward seeming was not the Christian simplicity\r\nafter which he had striven through years of his youth and prime, and\r\nwhich he had preached as a chief fruit of the Divine life. In the\r\nstress and heat of the day, with cheeks burning, with shouts ringing in\r\nthe ears, who is so blest as to remember the yearnings he had in the\r\ncool and silent morning and know that he has not belied them?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God, it is for the sake of the people\xe2\x80\x94because they are blind\xe2\x80\x94because\r\ntheir faith depends on me. If I put on sackcloth and cast myself among\r\nthe ashes, who will take up the standard and head the battle? Have I\r\nnot been led by a way which I knew not to the work that lies before\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conflict was one that could not end, and in the effort at prayerful\r\npleading the uneasy mind laved its smart continually in thoughts of the\r\ngreatness of that task which there was no man else to fulfil if he\r\nforsook it. It was not a thing of everyday that a man should be\r\ninspired with the vision and the daring that made a sacred rebel.\r\n\r\nEven the words of prayer had died away. He continued to kneel, but his\r\nmind was filled with the images of results to be felt through all\r\nEurope; and the sense of immediate difficulties was being lost in the\r\nglow of that vision, when the knocking at the door announced the\r\nexpected visit.\r\n\r\nSavonarola drew on his mantle before he left his cell, as was his\r\ncustom when he received visitors; and with that immediate response to\r\nany appeal from without which belongs to a power-loving nature\r\naccustomed to make its power felt by speech, he met Tito with a glance\r\nas self-possessed and strong as if he had risen from resolution instead\r\nof conflict.\r\n\r\nTito did not kneel, but simply made a greeting of profound deference,\r\nwhich Savonarola received quietly without any sacerdotal words, and\r\nthen desiring him to be seated, said at once\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour business is something of weight, my son, that could not be\r\nconveyed through others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly, father, else I should not have presumed to ask it. I will\r\nnot trespass on your time by any proem. I gathered from a remark of\r\nMesser Domenico Mazzinghi that you might be glad to make use of the\r\nnext special courier who is sent to France with despatches from the\r\nTen. I must entreat you to pardon me if I have been too officious; but\r\ninasmuch as Messer Domenico is at this moment away at his villa, I\r\nwished to apprise you that a courier carrying important letters is\r\nabout to depart for Lyons at daybreak to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe muscles of Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s face were eminently under command, as\r\nmust be the case with all men whose personality is powerful, and in\r\ndeliberate speech he was habitually cautious, confiding his intentions\r\nto none without necessity. But under any strong mental stimulus, his\r\neyes were liable to a dilatation and added brilliancy that no strength\r\nof will could control. He looked steadily at Tito, and did not answer\r\nimmediately, as if he had to consider whether the information he had\r\njust heard met any purpose of his.\r\n\r\nTito, whose glance never seemed observant, but rarely let anything\r\nescape it, had expected precisely that dilatation and flash of\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s eyes which he had noted on other occasions. He saw it, and\r\nthen immediately busied himself in adjusting his gold fibula, which had\r\ngot wrong; seeming to imply that he awaited an answer patiently.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Savonarola had expected to receive this intimation\r\nfrom Domenico Mazzinghi, one of the Ten, an ardent disciple of his whom\r\nhe had already employed to write a private letter to the Florentine\r\nambassador in France, to prepare the way for a letter to the French\r\nking himself in Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, which now lay ready in the\r\ndesk at his side. It was a letter calling on the king to assist in\r\nsummoning a General Council, that might reform the abuses of the\r\nChurch, and begin by deposing Pope Alexander, who was not rightfully\r\nPope, being a vicious unbeliever, elected by corruption and governing\r\nby simony.\r\n\r\nThis fact was not what Tito knew, but what his constructive talent,\r\nguided by subtle indications, had led him to guess and hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Savonarola, quietly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is true I have\r\nletters which I would gladly send by safe conveyance under cover to our\r\nambassador. Our community of San Marco, as you know, has affairs in\r\nFrance, being, amongst other things, responsible for a debt to that\r\nsingularly wise and experienced Frenchman, Signor Philippe de Comines,\r\non the library of the Medici, which we purchased; but I apprehend that\r\nDomenico Mazzinghi himself may return to the city before evening, and I\r\nshould gain more time for preparation of the letters if I waited to\r\ndeposit them in his hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly, reverend father, that might be better on all grounds,\r\nexcept one, namely, that if anything occurred to hinder Messer\r\nDomenico\xe2\x80\x99s return, the despatch of the letters would require either\r\nthat I should come to San Marco again at a late hour, or that you\r\nshould send them to me by your secretary; and I am aware that you wish\r\nto guard against the false inferences which might be drawn from a too\r\nfrequent communication between yourself and any officer of the\r\ngovernment.\xe2\x80\x9d In throwing out this difficulty Tito felt that the more\r\nunwillingness the Frate showed to trust him, the more certain he would\r\nbe of his conjecture.\r\n\r\nSavonarola was silent; but while he kept his mouth firm, a slight glow\r\nrose in his face with the suppressed excitement that was growing within\r\nhim. It would be a critical moment\xe2\x80\x94that in which he delivered the\r\nletter out of his own hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most probable that Messer Domenico will return in time,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTito, affecting to consider the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s determination settled, and\r\nrising from his chair as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWith your permission, I will take\r\nmy leave, father, not to trespass on your time when my errand is done;\r\nbut as I may not be favoured with another interview, I venture to\r\nconfide to you\xe2\x80\x94what is not yet known to others, except to the\r\nmagnificent Ten\xe2\x80\x94that I contemplate resigning my secretaryship, and\r\nleaving Florence shortly. Am I presuming too much on your interest in\r\nstating what relates chiefly to myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak on, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frate; \xe2\x80\x9cI desire to know your prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find, then, that I have mistaken my real vocation in forsaking the\r\ncareer of pure letters, for which I was brought up. The politics of\r\nFlorence, father, are worthy to occupy the greatest mind\xe2\x80\x94to occupy\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94when a man is in a position to execute his own ideas; but when,\r\nlike me, he can only hope to be the mere instrument of changing\r\nschemes, he requires to be animated by the minor attachments of a born\r\nFlorentine: also, my wife\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy alienation from a Florentine\r\nresidence since the painful events of August naturally influences me. I\r\nwish to join her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSavonarola inclined his head approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend, then, soon to leave Florence, to visit the chief courts of\r\nEurope, and to widen my acquaintance with the men of letters in the\r\nvarious universities. I shall go first to the court of Hungary, where\r\nscholars are eminently welcome; and I shall probably start in a week or\r\nten days. I have not concealed from you, father, that I am no religious\r\nenthusiast; I have not my wife\xe2\x80\x99s ardour; but religious enthusiasm, as I\r\nconceive, is not necessary in order to appreciate the grandeur and\r\njustice of your views concerning the government of nations and the\r\nChurch. And if you condescend to intrust me with any commission that\r\nwill further the relations you wish to establish, I shall feel\r\nhonoured. May I now take my leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, my son. When you depart from Florence I will send a letter to\r\nyour wife, of whose spiritual welfare I would fain be assured, for she\r\nleft me in anger. As for the letters to France, such as I have ready\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSavonarola rose and turned to his desk as he spoke. He took from it a\r\nletter on which Tito could see, but not read, an address in the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown minute and exquisite handwriting, still to be seen covering the\r\nmargins of his Bibles. He took a large sheet of paper, enclosed the\r\nletter, and sealed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, before Savonarola had time to speak,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunless it were your decided wish, I would rather not incur the\r\nresponsibility of carrying away the letter. Messer Domenico Mazzinghi\r\nwill doubtless return, or, if not, Fra Niccol\xc3\xb2 can convey it to me at\r\nthe second hour of the evening, when I shall place the other despatches\r\nin the courier\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt present, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frate, waiving that point, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\r\nto address this packet to our ambassador in your own handwriting, which\r\nis preferable to my secretary\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito sat down to write the address while the Frate stood by him with\r\nfolded arms, the glow mounting in his cheek, and his lip at last\r\nquivering. Tito rose and was about to move away, when Savonarola said\r\nabruptly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, my son. There is no use in waiting. It does not\r\nplease me that Fra Niccol\xc3\xb2 should have needless errands to the\r\nPalazzo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Tito took the letter, Savonarola stood in suppressed excitement that\r\nforbade further speech. There seems to be a subtle emanation from\r\npassionate natures like his, making their mental states tell\r\nimmediately on others; when they are absent-minded and inwardly excited\r\nthere is silence in the air.\r\n\r\nTito made a deep reverence and went out with the letter under his\r\nmantle.\r\n\r\nThe letter was duly delivered to the courier and carried out of\r\nFlorence. But before that happened another messenger, privately\r\nemployed by Tito, had conveyed information in cipher, which was carried\r\nby a series of relays to armed agents of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of\r\nMilan, on the watch for the very purpose of intercepting despatches on\r\nthe borders of the Milanese territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\nThe Trial by Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle more than a week after, on the seventh of April, the great\r\nPiazza della Signoria presented a stranger spectacle even than the\r\nfamous Bonfire of Vanities. And a greater multitude had assembled to\r\nsee it than had ever before tried to find place for themselves in the\r\nwide Piazza, even on the day of San Giovanni.\r\n\r\nIt was near mid-day, and since the early morning there had been a\r\ngradual swarming of the people at every coign of vantage or\r\ndisadvantage offered by the fa\xc3\xa7ades and roofs of the houses, and such\r\nspaces of the pavement as were free to the public. Men were seated on\r\niron rods that made a sharp angle with the rising wall, were clutching\r\nslim pillars with arms and legs, were astride on the necks of the rough\r\nstatuary that here and there surmounted the entrances of the grander\r\nhouses, were finding a palm\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth of seat on a bit of architrave,\r\nand a footing on the rough projections of the rustic stonework, while\r\nthey clutched the strong iron rings or staples driven into the walls\r\nbeside them.\r\n\r\nFor they were come to see a Miracle: cramped limbs and abraded flesh\r\nseemed slight inconveniences with that prospect close at hand. It is\r\nthe ordinary lot of mankind to hear of miracles, and more or less to\r\nbelieve in them; but now the Florentines were going to see one. At the\r\nvery least they would see half a miracle; for if the monk did not come\r\nwhole out of the fire, they would see him enter it, and infer that he\r\nwas burned in the middle.\r\n\r\nThere could be no reasonable doubt, it seemed, that the fire would be\r\nkindled, and that the monks would enter it. For there, before their\r\neyes, was the long platform, eight feet broad, and twenty yards long,\r\nwith a grove of fuel heaped up terribly, great branches of dry oak as a\r\nfoundation, crackling thorns above, and well-anointed tow and rags,\r\nknown to make fine flames in Florentine illuminations. The platform\r\nbegan at the corner of the marble terrace in front of the Old Palace,\r\nclose to Marzocco, the stone lion, whose aged visage looked frowningly\r\nalong the grove of fuel that stretched obliquely across the Piazza.\r\n\r\nBesides that, there were three large bodies of armed men: five hundred\r\nhired soldiers of the Signoria stationed before the palace; five\r\nhundred Compagnacci under Dolfo Spini, far-off on the opposite side of\r\nthe Piazza; and three hundred armed citizens of another sort, under\r\nMarco Salviati, Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s friend, in front of Orgagna\xe2\x80\x99s Loggia,\r\nwhere the Franciscans and Dominicans were to be placed with their\r\nchampions.\r\n\r\nHere had been much expense of money and labour, and high dignities were\r\nconcerned. There could be no reasonable doubt that something great was\r\nabout to happen; and it would certainly be a great thing if the two\r\nmonks were simply burned, for in that case too God would have spoken,\r\nand said very plainly that Fra Girolamo was not His prophet.\r\n\r\nAnd there was not much longer to wait, for it was now near mid-day.\r\nHalf the monks were already at their post, and that half of the Loggia\r\nthat lies towards the Palace was already filled with grey mantles; but\r\nthe other half, divided off by boards, was still empty of everything\r\nexcept a small altar. The Franciscans had entered and taken their\r\nplaces in silence. But now, at the other side of the Piazza was heard\r\nloud chanting from two hundred voices, and there was general\r\nsatisfaction, if not in the chanting, at least in the evidence that the\r\nDominicans were come. That loud chanting repetition of the prayer, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nGod arise, and let His enemies be scattered,\xe2\x80\x9d was unpleasantly\r\nsuggestive to some impartial ears of a desire to vaunt confidence and\r\nexcite dismay; and so was the flame-coloured velvet cope in which Fra\r\nDomenico was arrayed as he headed the procession, cross in hand, his\r\nsimple mind really exalted with faith, and with the genuine intention\r\nto enter the flames for the glory of God and Fra Girolamo. Behind him\r\ncame Savonarola in the white vestment of a priest, carrying in his\r\nhands a vessel containing the consecrated Host. He, too, was chanting\r\nloudly; he, too, looked firm and confident, and as all eyes were turned\r\neagerly on him, either in anxiety, curiosity, or malignity, from the\r\nmoment when he entered the Piazza till he mounted the steps of the\r\nLoggia and deposited the Sacrament on the altar, there was an\r\nintensifying flash and energy in his countenance responding to that\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\nWe are so made, almost all of us, that the false seeming which we have\r\nthought of with painful shrinking when beforehand in our solitude it\r\nhas urged itself on us as a necessity, will possess our muscles and\r\nmove our lips as if nothing but that were easy when once we have come\r\nunder the stimulus of expectant eyes and ears. And the strength of that\r\nstimulus to Savonarola can hardly be measured by the experience of\r\nordinary lives. Perhaps no man has ever had a mighty influence over his\r\nfellows without having the innate need to dominate, and this need\r\nusually becomes the more imperious in proportion as the complications\r\nof life make Self inseparable from a purpose which is not selfish. In\r\nthis way it came to pass that on the day of the Trial by Fire, the\r\ndoubleness which is the pressing temptation in every public career,\r\nwhether of priest, orator, or statesman, was more strongly defined in\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness as the acting of a part, than at any other\r\nperiod in his life. He was struggling not against impending martyrdom,\r\nbut against impending ruin.\r\n\r\nTherefore he looked and acted as if he were thoroughly confident, when\r\nall the while foreboding was pressing with leaden weight on his heart,\r\nnot only because of the probable issues of this trial, but because of\r\nanother event already past\xe2\x80\x94an event which was spreading a sunny\r\nsatisfaction through the mind of a man who was looking down at the\r\npassion-worn prophet from a window of the Old Palace. It was a common\r\nturning-point towards which those widely-sundered lives had been\r\nconverging, that two evenings ago the news had come that the Florentine\r\ncourier of the Ten had been arrested and robbed of all his despatches,\r\nso that Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s letter was already in the hands of the Duke of\r\nMilan, and would soon be in the hands of the Pope, not only heightening\r\nrage, but giving a new justification to extreme measures. There was no\r\nmalignity in Tito Melema\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction: it was the mild\r\nself-gratulation of a man who has won a game that has employed\r\nhypothetic skill, not a game that has stirred the muscles and heated\r\nthe blood. Of course that bundle of desires and contrivances called\r\nhuman nature, when moulded into the form of a plain-featured Frate\r\nPredicatore, more or less of an impostor, could not be a pathetic\r\nobject to a brilliant-minded scholar who understood everything. Yet\r\nthis tonsured Girolamo with the high nose and large under lip was an\r\nimmensely clever Frate, mixing with his absurd superstitions or\r\nfabrications very remarkable notions about government: no babbler, but\r\na man who could keep his secrets. Tito had no more spite against him\r\nthan against Saint Dominic. On the contrary, Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s existence\r\nhad been highly convenient to Tito Melema, furnishing him with that\r\nround of the ladder from which he was about to leap on to a new and\r\nsmooth footing very much to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. And everything now was\r\nin forward preparation for that leap: let one more sun rise and set,\r\nand Tito hoped to quit Florence. He had been so industrious that he\r\nfelt at full leisure to amuse himself with to-day\xe2\x80\x99s comedy, which the\r\nthick-headed Dolfo Spini could never have brought about but for him.\r\n\r\nNot yet did the loud chanting cease, but rather swelled to a deafening\r\nroar, being taken up in all parts of the Piazza by the Piagnoni, who\r\ncarried their little red crosses as a badge, and, most of them, chanted\r\nthe prayer for the confusion of God\xe2\x80\x99s enemies with the expectation of\r\nan answer to be given through the medium of a more signal personage\r\nthan Fra Domenico. This good Frate in his flame-coloured cope was now\r\nkneeling before the little altar on which the Sacrament was deposited,\r\nawaiting his summons.\r\n\r\nOn the Franciscan side of the Loggia there was no chanting and no\r\nflame-colour: only silence and greyness. But there was this\r\ncounterbalancing difference, that the Franciscans had two champions: a\r\ncertain Fra Giuliano was to pair with Fra Domenico, while the original\r\nchampion, Fra Francesco, confined his challenge to Savonarola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the men perched uneasily on the rods and pillars,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call must be ready now. This chanting might stop, and we should see\r\nbetter when the Frati are moving towards the platform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Frati were not to be seen moving yet. Pale Franciscan faces\r\nwere looking uneasily over the boarding at that flame-coloured cope. It\r\nhad an evil look and might be enchanted, so that a false miracle would\r\nbe wrought by magic. Your monk may come whole out of the fire, and yet\r\nit may be the work of the devil.\r\n\r\nAnd now there was passing to and fro between the Loggia and the marble\r\nterrace of the Palazzo, and the roar of chanting became a little\r\nquieter, for every one at a distance was beginning to watch more\r\neagerly. But it soon appeared that the new movement was not a\r\nbeginning, but an obstacle to beginning. The dignified Florentines\r\nappointed to preside over this affair as moderators on each side, went\r\nin and out of the Palace, and there was much debate with the\r\nFranciscans. But at last it was clear that Fra Domenico, conspicuous in\r\nhis flame-colour, was being fetched towards the Palace. Probably the\r\nfire had already been kindled\xe2\x80\x94it was difficult to see at a distance\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe miracle was going to begin.\r\n\r\nNot at all. The flame-coloured cope disappeared within the Palace; then\r\nanother Dominican was fetched away; and for a long while everything\r\nwent on as before\xe2\x80\x94the tiresome chanting, which was not miraculous, and\r\nFra Girolamo in his white vestment standing just in the same place. But\r\nat last something happened: Fra Domenico was seen coming out of the\r\nPalace again, and returning to his brethren. He had changed all his\r\nclothes with a brother monk, but he was guarded on each flank by a\r\nFranciscan, lest coming into the vicinity of Savonarola he should be\r\nenchanted again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the distant spectators, a little less conscious of\r\ncramped limbs and hunger, \xe2\x80\x9cFra Domenico is not going to enter the fire.\r\nIt is Fra Girolamo who offers himself after all. We shall see him move\r\npresently, and if he comes out of the flames we shall have a fine view\r\nof him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Fra Girolamo did not move, except with the ordinary action\r\naccompanying speech. The speech was bold and firm, perhaps somewhat\r\nironically remonstrant, like that of Elijah to the priests of Baal,\r\ndemanding the cessation of these trivial delays. But speech is the most\r\nirritating kind of argument for those who are out of hearing, cramped\r\nin the limbs, and empty in the stomach. And what need was there for\r\nspeech? If the miracle did not begin, it could be no one\xe2\x80\x99s fault but\r\nFra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s, who might put an end to all difficulties by offering\r\nhimself now the fire was ready, as he had been forward enough to do\r\nwhen there was no fuel in sight.\r\n\r\nMore movement to and fro, more discussion; and the afternoon seemed to\r\nbe slipping away all the faster because the clouds had gathered, and\r\nchanged the light on everything, and sent a chill through the\r\nspectators, hungry in mind and body.\r\n\r\n_Now_ it was the crucifix which Fra Domenico wanted to carry into the\r\nfire and must not be allowed to profane in that manner. After some\r\nlittle resistance Savonarola gave way to this objection, and thus had\r\nthe advantage of making one more concession; but he immediately placed\r\nin Fra Domenico\xe2\x80\x99s hands the vessel containing the consecrated Host. The\r\nidea that the presence of the sacred Mystery might in the worst\r\nextremity avert the ordinary effects of fire hovered in his mind as a\r\npossibility; but the issue on which he counted was of a more positive\r\nkind. In taking up the Host he said quietly, as if he were only doing\r\nwhat had been presupposed from the first\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince they are not willing that you should enter with the crucifix, my\r\nbrother, enter simply with the Sacrament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNew horror in the Franciscans; new firmness in Savonarola. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nimpious presumption to carry the Sacrament into the fire: if it were\r\nburned the scandal would be great in the minds of the weak and\r\nignorant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all: even if it were burned, the Accidents only would be\r\nconsumed, the Substance would remain.\xe2\x80\x9d Here was a question that might\r\nbe argued till set of sun and remain as elastic as ever; and no one\r\ncould propose settling it by proceeding to the trial, since it was\r\nessentially a preliminary question. It was only necessary that both\r\nsides should remain firm\xe2\x80\x94that the Franciscans should persist in not\r\npermitting the Host to be carried into the fire, and that Fra Domenico\r\nshould persist in refusing to enter without it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the clouds were getting darker, the air chiller. Even the\r\nchanting was missed now it had given way to inaudible argument; and the\r\nconfused sounds of talk from all points of the Piazza, showing that\r\nexpectation was everywhere relaxing, contributed to the irritating\r\npresentiment that nothing decisive would be done. Here and there a\r\ndropping shout was heard; then, more frequent shouts in a rising scale\r\nof scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight the fire and drive them in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us have a smell of roast\xe2\x80\x94we want our dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome Prophet, let us know whether anything is to happen before the\r\ntwenty-four hours are over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, what\xe2\x80\x99s your last vision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a dozen in his inside; they\xe2\x80\x99re the small change for a\r\nmiracle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOla, Frate, where are you? Never mind wasting the fuel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the same movement to and fro between the Loggia and the Palace;\r\nstill the same debate, slow and unintelligible to the multitude as the\r\ncolloquies of insects that touch antennas to no other apparent effect\r\nthan that of going and coming. But an interpretation was not long\r\nwanting to unheard debates in which Fra Girolamo was constantly a\r\nspeaker: it was he who was hindering the trial; everybody was appealing\r\nto him now, and he was hanging back.\r\n\r\nSoon the shouts ceased to be distinguishable, and were lost in an\r\nuproar not simply of voices, but of clashing metal and trampling feet.\r\nThe suggestions of the irritated people had stimulated old impulses in\r\nDolfo Spini and his band of Compagnacci; it seemed an opportunity not\r\nto be lost for putting an end to Florentine difficulties by getting\r\npossession of the arch-hypocrite\xe2\x80\x99s person; and there was a vigorous\r\nrush of the armed men towards the Loggia, thrusting the people aside,\r\nor driving them on to the file of soldiery stationed in front of the\r\nPalace. At this movement, everything was suspended both with monks and\r\nembarrassed magistrates except the palpitating watch to see what would\r\ncome of the struggle.\r\n\r\nBut the Loggia was well guarded by the band under the brave Salviati;\r\nthe soldiers of the Signoria assisted in the repulse; and the trampling\r\nand rushing were all backward again towards the Tetto de\xe2\x80\x99 Pisani, when\r\nthe blackness of the heavens seemed to intensify in this moment of\r\nutter confusion; and the rain, which had already been felt in scattered\r\ndrops, began to fall with rapidly growing violence, wetting the fuel,\r\nand running in streams off the platform, wetting the weary hungry\r\npeople to the skin, and driving every man\xe2\x80\x99s disgust and rage inwards to\r\nferment there in the damp darkness.\r\n\r\nEverybody knew now that the Trial by Fire was not to happen. The\r\nSignoria was doubtless glad of the rain, as an obvious reason, better\r\nthan any pretext, for declaring that both parties might go home. It was\r\nthe issue which Savonarola had expected and desired; yet it would be an\r\nill description of what he felt to say that he was glad. As that rain\r\nfell, and plashed on the edge of the Loggia, and sent spray over the\r\naltar and all garments and faces, the Frate knew that the demand for\r\nhim to enter the fire was at an end. But he knew too, with a certainty\r\nas irresistible as the damp chill that had taken possession of his\r\nframe, that the design of his enemies was fulfilled, and that his\r\nhonour was not saved. He knew that he should have to make his way to\r\nSan Marco again through the enraged crowd, and that the hearts of many\r\nfriends who would once have defended him with their lives would now be\r\nturned against him.\r\n\r\nWhen the rain had ceased he asked for a guard from the Signoria, and it\r\nwas given him. Had he said that he was willing to die for the work of\r\nhis life? Yes, and he had not spoken falsely. But to die in\r\ndishonour\xe2\x80\x94held up to scorn as a hypocrite and a false prophet? \xe2\x80\x9cO God!\r\n_that_ is not martyrdom! It is the blotting out of a life that has been\r\na protest against wrong. Let me die because of the worth that is in me,\r\nnot because of my weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased, and the light from the breaking clouds fell on\r\nSavonarola as he left the Loggia in the midst of his guard, walking as\r\nhe had come, with the Sacrament in his hand. But there seemed no glory\r\nin the light that fell on him now, no smile of heaven: it was only that\r\nlight which shines on, patiently and impartially, justifying or\r\ncondemning by simply showing all things in the slow history of their\r\nripening. He heard no blessing, no tones of pity, but only taunts and\r\nthreats. He knew this was a foretaste of coming bitterness; yet his\r\ncourage mounted under all moral attack, and he showed no sign of\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell parried, Frate!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tito, as Savonarola descended the steps of\r\nthe Loggia. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I fear your career at Florence is ended. What say you,\r\nmy Niccol\xc3\xb2?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity his falsehoods were not all of a wise sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMacchiavelli, with a melancholy shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the times so much on his\r\nside as they are about Church affairs, he might have done something\r\ngreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\nA Masque of the Furies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was Palm Sunday, or Olive Sunday, as it was chiefly called\r\nin the olive-growing Valdarno; and the morning sun shone with a more\r\ndelicious clearness for the yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s rain. Once more Savonarola\r\nmounted the pulpit in San Marco, and saw a flock around him whose faith\r\nin him was still unshaken; and this morning in calm and sad sincerity\r\nhe declared himself ready to die: in front of all visions he saw his\r\nown doom. Once more he uttered the benediction, and saw the faces of\r\nmen and women lifted towards him in venerating love. Then he descended\r\nthe steps of the pulpit and turned away from that sight for ever.\r\n\r\nFor before the sun had set Florence was in an uproar. The passions\r\nwhich had been roused the day before had been smouldering through that\r\nquiet morning, and had now burst out again with a fury not unassisted\r\nby design, and not without official connivance. The uproar had begun at\r\nthe Duomo in an attempt of some Compagnacci to hinder the evening\r\nsermon, which the Piagnoni had assembled to hear. But no sooner had\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s blood mounted and the disturbances had become an affray than the\r\ncry arose, \xe2\x80\x9cTo San Marco! the fire to San Marco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd long before the daylight had died, both the church and convent were\r\nbeing besieged by an enraged and continually increasing multitude. Not\r\nwithout resistance. For the monks, long conscious of growing hostility\r\nwithout, had arms within their walls, and some of them fought as\r\nvigorously in their long white tunics as if they had been Knights\r\nTemplars. Even the command of Savonarola could not prevail against the\r\nimpulse to self-defence in arms that were still muscular under the\r\nDominican serge. There were laymen too who had not chosen to depart,\r\nand some of them fought fiercely: there was firing from the high altar\r\nclose by the great crucifix, there was pouring of stones and hot embers\r\nfrom the convent roof, there was close fighting with swords in the\r\ncloisters. Notwithstanding the force of the assailants, the attack\r\nlasted till deep night.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations of the Government had all been against the convent;\r\nearly in the attack guards had been sent for, not to disperse the\r\nassailants, but to command all within the convent to lay down their\r\narms, all laymen to depart from it, and Savonarola himself to quit the\r\nFlorentine territory within twelve hours. Had Savonarola quitted the\r\nconvent then, he could hardly have escaped being torn to pieces; he was\r\nwilling to go, but his friends hindered him. It was felt to be a great\r\nrisk even for some laymen of high name to depart by the garden wall,\r\nbut among those who had chosen to do so was Francesco Valori, who hoped\r\nto raise rescue from without.\r\n\r\nAnd now when it was deep night\xe2\x80\x94when the struggle could hardly have\r\nlasted much longer, and the Compagnacci might soon have carried their\r\nswords into the library, where Savonarola was praying with the Brethren\r\nwho had either not taken up arms or had laid them down at his\r\ncommand\xe2\x80\x94there came a second body of guards, commissioned by the\r\nSignoria to demand the persons of Fra Girolamo and his two coadjutors,\r\nFra Domenico and Fra Salvestro.\r\n\r\nLoud was the roar of triumphant hate when the light of lanterns showed\r\nthe Frate issuing from the door of the convent with a guard who\r\npromised him no other safety than that of the prison. The struggle now\r\nwas, who should get first in the stream that rushed up the narrow\r\nstreet to see the Prophet carried back in ignominy to the Piazza where\r\nhe had braved it yesterday\xe2\x80\x94who should be in the best place for reaching\r\nhis ear with insult, nay, if possible, for smiting him and kicking him.\r\nThis was not difficult for some of the armed Compagnacci who were not\r\nprevented from mixing themselves with the guards.\r\n\r\nWhen Savonarola felt himself dragged and pushed along in the midst of\r\nthat hooting multitude; when lanterns were lifted to show him deriding\r\nfaces; when he felt himself spit upon, smitten and kicked with grossest\r\nwords of insult, it seemed to him that the worst bitterness of life was\r\npast. If men judged him guilty, and were bent on having his blood, it\r\nwas only death that awaited him. But the worst drop of bitterness can\r\nnever be wrung on to our lips from without: the lowest depth of\r\nresignation is not to be found in martyrdom; it is only to be found\r\nwhen we have covered our heads in silence and felt, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not worthy to\r\nbe a martyr; the Truth shall prosper, but not by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that brief imperfect triumph of insulting the Frate, who had soon\r\ndisappeared under the doorway of the Old Palace, was only like the\r\ntaste of blood to the tiger. Were there not the houses of the\r\nhypocrite\xe2\x80\x99s friends to be sacked? Already one-half of the armed\r\nmultitude, too much in the rear to share greatly in the siege of the\r\nconvent, had been employed in the more profitable work of attacking\r\nrich houses, not with planless desire for plunder, but with that\r\ndiscriminating selection of such as belonged to chief Piagnoni, which\r\nshowed that the riot was under guidance, and that the rabble with clubs\r\nand staves was well officered by sword-girt Compagnacci. Was there\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94next criminal after the Frate\xe2\x80\x94the ambitious Francesco Valori,\r\nsuspected of wanting with the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s help to make himself a Doge or\r\nGonfaloniere for life? And the grey-haired man who, eight months ago,\r\nhad lifted his arm and his voice in such ferocious demand for justice\r\non five of his fellow-citizens, only escaped from San Marco to\r\nexperience what _others_ called justice\xe2\x80\x94to see his house surrounded by\r\nan angry, greedy multitude, to see his wife shot dead with an arrow,\r\nand to be himself murdered, as he was on his way to answer a summons to\r\nthe Palazzo, by the swords of men named Ridolfi and Tornabuoni.\r\n\r\nIn this way that Masque of the Furies, called Riot, was played on in\r\nFlorence through the hours of night and early morning.\r\n\r\nBut the chief director was not visible: he had his reasons for issuing\r\nhis orders from a private retreat, being of rather too high a name to\r\nlet his red feather be seen waving amongst all the work that was to be\r\ndone before the dawn. The retreat was the same house and the same room\r\nin a quiet street between Santa Croce and San Marco, where we have seen\r\nTito paying a secret visit to Dolfo Spini. Here the Captain of the\r\nCompagnacci sat through this memorable night, receiving visitors who\r\ncame and went, and went and came, some of them in the guise of armed\r\nCompagnacci, others dressed obscurely and without visible arms. There\r\nwas abundant wine on the table, with drinking-cups for chance comers\r\nand though Spini was on his guard against excessive drinking, he took\r\nenough from time to time to heighten the excitement produced by the\r\nnews that was being brought to him continually.\r\n\r\nAmong the obscurely-dressed visitors Ser Ceccone was one of the most\r\nfrequent, and as the hours advanced towards the morning twilight he had\r\nremained as Spini\xe2\x80\x99s constant companion, together with Francesco Cei,\r\nwho was then in rather careless hiding in Florence, expecting to have\r\nhis banishment revoked when the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s fall had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe tapers had burnt themselves into low shapeless masses, and holes in\r\nthe shutters were just marked by a sombre outward light, when Spini,\r\nwho had started from his seat and walked up and down with an angry\r\nflush on his face at some talk that had been going forward with those\r\ntwo unmilitary companions, burst out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil spit him! he shall pay for it, though. Ha, ha! the claws\r\nshall be down on him when he little thinks of them. So _he_ was to be\r\nthe great man after all! He\xe2\x80\x99s been pretending to chuck everything\r\ntowards my cap, as if I were a blind beggarman, and all the while he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen winking and filling his own scarsella. I should like to hang skins\r\nabout him and set my hounds on him! And he\xe2\x80\x99s got that fine ruby of\r\nmine, I was fool enough to give him yesterday. Malediction! And he was\r\nlaughing at me in his sleeve two years ago, and spoiling the best plan\r\nthat ever was laid. I was a fool for trusting myself with a rascal who\r\nhad long-twisted contrivances that nobody could see to the end of but\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Greek, too, who dropped into Florence with gems packed about him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Francesco Cei, who had a slight smile of amusement on his face at\r\nSpini\xe2\x80\x99s fuming. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did _not_ choose your confidant very wisely, my\r\nDolfo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a cursed deal cleverer than you, Francesco, and handsomer too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Spini, turning on his associate with a general desire to worry\r\nanything that presented itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI humbly conceive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ser Ceccone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Messer Francesco\xe2\x80\x99s poetic\r\ngenius will outweigh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, rub your hands! I hate that notary\xe2\x80\x99s trick of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterrupted Spini, whose patronage consisted largely in this sort of\r\nfrankness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there comes Taddeo, or somebody: now\xe2\x80\x99s the time! What\r\nnews, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, as two Compagnacci entered with heated looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad!\xe2\x80\x9d said one. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people have made up their minds they were going\r\nto have the sacking of Soderini\xe2\x80\x99s house, and now they have been balked\r\nwe shall have them turning on us, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t take care. I suspect\r\nthere are some Mediceans buzzing about among them, and we may see them\r\nattacking your palace over the bridge before long, unless we can find a\r\nbait for them another way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Spini, and seizing Taddeo by the belt he drew him\r\naside to give him directions, while the other went on telling Cei how\r\nthe Signoria had interfered about Soderini\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEcco!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Spini, presently, giving Taddeo a slight push towards\r\nthe door. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, and make quick work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\nWaiting by the River.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the time when the two Compagnacci went on their errand, there was\r\nanother man who, on the opposite side of the Arno, was also going out\r\ninto the chill grey twilight. His errand, apparently, could have no\r\nrelation to theirs; he was making his way to the brink of the river at\r\na spot which, though within the city walls, was overlooked by no\r\ndwellings, and which only seemed the more shrouded and lonely for the\r\nwarehouses and granaries which at some little distance backward turned\r\ntheir shoulders to the river. There was a sloping width of long grass\r\nand rushes made all the more dank by broad gutters which here and there\r\nemptied themselves into the Arno.\r\n\r\nThe gutters and the loneliness were the attraction that drew this man\r\nto come and sit down among the grass, and bend over the waters that ran\r\nswiftly in the channelled slope at his side. For he had once had a\r\nlarge piece of bread brought to him by one of those friendly runlets,\r\nand more than once a raw carrot and apple-parings. It was worth while\r\nto wait for such chances in a place where there was no one to see, and\r\noften in his restless wakefulness he came to watch here before\r\ndaybreak; it might save him for one day the need of that silent begging\r\nwhich consisted in sitting on a church-step by the wayside out beyond\r\nthe Porta San Frediano.\r\n\r\nFor Baldassarre hated begging so much that he would perhaps have chosen\r\nto die rather than make even that silent appeal, but for one reason\r\nthat made him desire to live. It was no longer a hope; it was only that\r\npossibility which clings to every idea that has taken complete\r\npossession of the mind: the sort of possibility that makes a woman\r\nwatch on a headland for the ship which held something dear, though all\r\nher neighbours are certain that the ship was a wreck long years ago.\r\nAfter he had come out of the convent hospital, where the monks of San\r\nMiniato had taken care of him as long as he was helpless; after he had\r\nwatched in vain for the Wife who was to help him, and had begun to\r\nthink that she was dead of the pestilence that seemed to fill all the\r\nspace since the night he parted from her, he had been unable to\r\nconceive any way in which sacred vengeance could satisfy itself through\r\nhis arm. His knife was gone, and he was too feeble in body to win\r\nanother by work, too feeble in mind, even if he had had the knife, to\r\ncontrive that it should serve its one purpose. He was a shattered,\r\nbewildered, lonely old man; yet he desired to live: _he_ waited for\r\nsomething of which he had no distinct vision\xe2\x80\x94something dim,\r\nformless\xe2\x80\x94that startled him, and made strong pulsations within him, like\r\nthat unknown thing which we look for when we start from sleep, though\r\nno voice or touch has waked us. Baldassarre desired to live; and\r\ntherefore he crept out in the grey light, and seated himself in the\r\nlong grass, and watched the waters that had a faint promise in them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Compagnacci were busy at their work. The formidable bands\r\nof armed men, left to do their will with very little interference from\r\nan embarrassed if not conniving Signoria, had parted into two masses,\r\nbut both were soon making their way by different roads towards the\r\nArno. The smaller mass was making for the Ponte Rubaconte, the larger\r\nfor the Ponte Vecchio; but in both the same words had passed from mouth\r\nto mouth as a signal, and almost every man of the multitude knew that\r\nhe was going to the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi to sack a house there. If he knew no\r\nother reason, could he demand a better?\r\n\r\nThe armed Compagnacci knew something more, for a brief word of command\r\nflies quickly, and the leaders of the two streams of rabble had a\r\nperfect understanding that they would meet before a certain house a\r\nlittle towards the eastern end of the Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, where the master\r\nwould probably be in bed, and be surprised in his morning sleep.\r\n\r\nBut the master of that house was neither sleeping nor in bed; he had\r\nnot been in bed that night. For Tito\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to quit Florence had\r\nbeen stimulated by the events of the previous day: investigations would\r\nfollow in which appeals might be made to him delaying his departure:\r\nand in all delay he had an uneasy sense that there was danger.\r\nFalsehood had prospered and waxed strong; but it had nourished the twin\r\nlife, Fear. He no longer wore his armour, he was no longer afraid of\r\nBaldassarre; but from the corpse of that dead fear a spirit had\r\nrisen\xe2\x80\x94the undying _habit_ of fear. He felt he should not be safe till\r\nhe was out of this fierce, turbid Florence; and now he was ready to go.\r\nMaso was to deliver up his house to the new tenant; his horses and\r\nmules were awaiting him in San Gallo; Tessa and the children had been\r\nlodged for the night in the Borgo outside the gate, and would be\r\ndressed in readiness to mount the mules and join him. He descended the\r\nstone steps into the courtyard, he passed through the great doorway,\r\nnot the same Tito, but nearly as brilliant as on the day when he had\r\nfirst entered that house and made the mistake of falling in love with\r\nRomola. The mistake was remedied now: the old life was cast off, and\r\nwas soon to be far behind him.\r\n\r\nHe turned with rapid steps towards the Piazza dei Mozzi, intending to\r\npass over the Ponte Rubaconte; but as he went along certain sounds came\r\nupon his ears that made him turn round and walk yet more quickly in the\r\nopposite direction. Was the mob coming into Oltrarno? It was a\r\nvexation, for he would have preferred the more private road. He must\r\nnow go by the Ponte Vecchio; and unpleasant sensations made him draw\r\nhis mantle close round him, and walk at his utmost speed. There was no\r\none to see him in that grey twilight. But before he reached the end of\r\nthe Via de\xe2\x80\x99 Bardi, like sounds fell on his ear again, and this time\r\nthey were much louder and nearer. Could he have been deceived before?\r\nThe mob must be coming over the Ponte Vecchio. Again he turned, from an\r\nimpulse of fear that was stronger than reflection; but it was only to\r\nbe assured that the mob was actually entering the street from the\r\nopposite end. He chose not to go back to his house: after all they\r\nwould not attack _him_. Still, he had some valuables about him; and all\r\nthings except reason and order are possible with a mob. But necessity\r\ndoes the work of courage. He went on towards the Ponte Vecchio, the\r\nrush and the trampling and the confused voices getting so loud before\r\nhim that he had ceased to hear them behind.\r\n\r\nFor he had reached the end of the street, and the crowd pouring from\r\nthe bridge met him at the turning and hemmed in his way. He had not\r\ntime to wonder at a sudden shout before he felt himself surrounded,\r\nnot, in the first instance, by an unarmed rabble, but by armed\r\nCompagnacci; the next sensation was that his cap fell off, and that he\r\nwas thrust violently forward amongst the rabble, along the narrow\r\npassage of the bridge. Then he distinguished the shouts, \xe2\x80\x9cPiagnone!\r\nMedicean! Piagnone! Throw him over the bridge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mantle was being torn off him with strong pulls that would have\r\nthrottled him if the fibula had not given way. Then his scarsella was\r\nsnatched at; but all the while he was being hustled and dragged; and\r\nthe snatch failed\xe2\x80\x94his scarsella still hung at his side. Shouting,\r\nyelling, half motiveless execration rang stunningly in his ears,\r\nspreading even amongst those who had not yet seen him, and only knew\r\nthere was a man to be reviled. Tito\xe2\x80\x99s horrible dread was that he should\r\nbe struck down or trampled on before he reached the open arches that\r\nsurmount the centre of the bridge. There was one hope for him, that\r\nthey might throw him over before they had wounded him or beaten the\r\nstrength out of him; and his whole soul was absorbed in that one hope\r\nand its obverse terror.\r\n\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94they _were_ at the arches. In that moment Tito, with bloodless face\r\nand eyes dilated, had one of the self-preserving inspirations that come\r\nin extremity. With a sudden desperate effort he mastered the clasp of\r\nhis belt, and flung belt and scarsella forward towards a yard of clear\r\nspace against the parapet, crying in a ringing voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are diamonds! there is gold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the instant the hold on him was relaxed, and there was a rush\r\ntowards the scarsella. He threw himself on the parapet with a desperate\r\nleap, and the next moment plunged\xe2\x80\x94plunged with a great plash into the\r\ndark river far below.\r\n\r\nIt was his chance of salvation; and it was a good chance. His life had\r\nbeen saved once before by his fine swimming, and as he rose to the\r\nsurface again after his long dive he had a sense of deliverance. He\r\nstruck out with all the energy of his strong prime, and the current\r\nhelped him. If he could only swim beyond the Ponte alla Carrara he\r\nmight land in a remote part of the city, and even yet reach San Gallo.\r\nLife was still before him. And the idiot mob, shouting and bellowing on\r\nthe bridge there, would think he was drowned.\r\n\r\nThey did think so. Peering over the parapet along the dark stream, they\r\ncould not see afar off the moving blackness of the floating hair, and\r\nthe velvet tunic-sleeves.\r\n\r\nIt was only from the other way that a pale olive face could be seen\r\nlooking white above the dark water: a face not easy even for the\r\nindifferent to forget, with its square forehead, the long low arch of\r\nthe eyebrows, and the long lustrous agate-like eyes. Onward the face\r\nwent on the dark current, with inflated quivering nostrils, with the\r\nblue veins distended on the temples. One bridge was passed\xe2\x80\x94the bridge\r\nof Santa Trinita. Should he risk landing now rather than trust to his\r\nstrength? No. He heard, or fancied he heard, yells and cries pursuing\r\nhim. Terror pressed him most from the side of his fellow-men: he was\r\nless afraid of indefinite chances, and he swam on, panting and\r\nstraining. He was not so fresh as he would have been if he had passed\r\nthe night in sleep.\r\n\r\nYet the next bridge\xe2\x80\x94the last bridge\xe2\x80\x94was passed. He was conscious of it;\r\nbut in the tumult of his blood, he could only feel vaguely that he was\r\nsafe and might land. But where? The current was having its way with\r\nhim: he hardly knew where he was: exhaustion was bringing on the dreamy\r\nstate that precedes unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nBut now there were eyes that discerned him\xe2\x80\x94aged eyes, strong for the\r\ndistance. Baldassarre, looking up blankly from the search in the runlet\r\nthat brought him nothing, had seen a white object coming along the\r\nbroader stream. Could that be any fortunate chance for _him_? He looked\r\nand looked till the object gathered form: then he leaned forward with a\r\nstart as he sat among the rank green stems, and his eyes seemed to be\r\nfilled with a new light. Yet he only watched\xe2\x80\x94motionless. Something was\r\nbeing brought to him.\r\n\r\nThe next instant a man\xe2\x80\x99s body was cast violently on the grass two yards\r\nfrom him, and he started forward like a panther, clutching the velvet\r\ntunic as he fell forward on the body and flashed a look in the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.\r\n\r\nDead\xe2\x80\x94was he dead? The eyes were rigid. But no, it could not be\xe2\x80\x94Justice\r\nhad brought him. Men looked dead sometimes, and yet the life came back\r\ninto them. Baldassarre did not feel feeble in that moment. He knew just\r\nwhat he could do. He got his large fingers within the neck of the tunic\r\nand held them there, kneeling on one knee beside the body and watching\r\nthe face. There was a fierce hope in his heart, but it was mixed with\r\ntrembling. In his eyes there was only fierceness: all the slow-burning\r\nremnant of life within him seemed to have leaped into flame.\r\n\r\nRigid\xe2\x80\x94rigid still. Those eyes with the half-fallen lids were locked\r\nagainst vengeance. _Could_ it be that he was dead? There was nothing to\r\nmeasure the time: it seemed long enough for hope to freeze into\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nSurely at last the eyelids were quivering: the eyes were no longer\r\nrigid. There was a vibrating light in them; they opened wide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes! You see me\xe2\x80\x94you know me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTito knew him; but he did not know whether it was life or death that\r\nhad brought him into the presence of his injured father. It might be\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94and death might mean this chill gloom with the face of the\r\nhideous past hanging over him for ever.\r\n\r\nBut now Baldassarre\xe2\x80\x99s only dread was, lest the young limbs should\r\nescape him. He pressed his knuckles against the round throat, and knelt\r\nupon the chest with all the force of his aged frame. Let death come\r\nnow!\r\n\r\nAgain he kept his watch on the face. And when the eyes were rigid\r\nagain, he dared not trust them. He would never lose his hold till some\r\none came and found them. Justice would send some witness, and then he,\r\nBaldassarre, would declare that he had killed this traitor, to whom he\r\nhad once been a father. They would perhaps believe him now, and then he\r\nwould be content with the struggle of justice on earth\xe2\x80\x94then he would\r\ndesire to die with his hold on this body, and follow the traitor to\r\nhell that he might clutch him there.\r\n\r\nAnd so he knelt, and so he pressed his knuckles against the round\r\nthroat, without trusting to the seeming death, till the light got\r\nstrong and he could kneel no longer. Then he sat on the body, still\r\nclutching the neck of the tunic. But the hours went on, and no witness\r\ncame. No eyes descried afar off the two human bodies among the tall\r\ngrass by the riverside. Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the\r\npreparation of a deeper tragedy.\r\n\r\nNot long after those two bodies were lying in the grass, Savonarola was\r\nbeing tortured, and crying out in his agony, \xe2\x80\x9cI will confess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not until the sun was westward that a waggon drawn by a mild\r\ngrey ox came to the edge of the grassy margin, and as the man who led\r\nit was leaning to gather up the round stones that lay heaped in\r\nreadiness to be carried away, he detected some startling object in the\r\ngrass. The aged man had fallen forward, and his dead clutch was on the\r\ngarment of the other. It was not possible to separate them: nay, it was\r\nbetter to put them into the waggon and carry them as they were into the\r\ngreat Piazza, that notice might be given to the Eight.\r\n\r\nAs the waggon entered the frequented streets there was a growing crowd\r\nescorting it with its strange burden. No one knew the bodies for a long\r\nwhile, for the aged face had fallen forward, half hiding the younger.\r\nBut before they had been moved out of sight, they had been recognised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that old man,\xe2\x80\x9d Piero di Cosimo had testified. \xe2\x80\x9cI painted his\r\nlikeness once. He is the prisoner who clutched Melema on the steps of\r\nthe Duomo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is perhaps the same old man who appeared at supper in my gardens,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bernardo Rucellai, one of the Eight. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten him. I\r\nthought he had died in prison. But there is no knowing the truth now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho shall put his finger on the work of justice, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x9d? Justice is like the Kingdom of God\xe2\x80\x94it is not without us as a\r\nfact, it is within us as a great yearning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s waking.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomola in her boat passed from dreaming into long deep sleep, and then\r\nagain from deep sleep into busy dreaming, till at last she felt herself\r\nstretching out her arms in the court of the Bargello, where the\r\nflickering flames of the tapers seemed to get stronger and stronger\r\ntill the dark scene was blotted out with light. Her eyes opened and she\r\nsaw it was the light of morning. Her boat was lying still in a little\r\ncreek; on her right-hand lay the speckless sapphire-blue of the\r\nMediterranean; on her left one of those scenes which were and still are\r\nrepeated again and again like a sweet rhythm, on the shores of that\r\nloveliest sea.\r\n\r\nIn a deep curve of the mountains lay a breadth of green land, curtained\r\nby gentle tree-shadowed slopes leaning towards the rocky heights. Up\r\nthese slopes might be seen here and there, gleaming between the\r\ntree-tops, a pathway leading to a little irregular mass of building\r\nthat seemed to have clambered in a hasty way up the mountain-side, and\r\ntaken a difficult stand there for the sake of showing the tall belfry\r\nas a sight of beauty to the scattered and clustered houses of the\r\nvillage below. The rays of the newly-risen sun fell obliquely on the\r\nwestward horn of this crescent-shaped nook: all else lay in dewy\r\nshadow. No sound came across the stillness; the very waters seemed to\r\nhave curved themselves there for rest.\r\n\r\nThe delicious sun-rays fell on Romola and thrilled her gently like a\r\ncaress. She lay motionless, hardly watching the scene; rather, feeling\r\nsimply the presence of peace and beauty. While we are still in our\r\nyouth there can always come, in our early waking, moments when mere\r\npassive existence is itself a Lethe, when the exquisiteness of subtle\r\nindefinite sensation creates a bliss which is without memory and\r\nwithout desire. As the soft warmth penetrated Romola\xe2\x80\x99s young limbs, as\r\nher eyes rested on this sequestered luxuriance, it seemed that the\r\nagitating past had glided away like that dark scene in the Bargello,\r\nand that the afternoon dreams of her girlhood had really come back to\r\nher. For a minute or two the oblivion was untroubled; she did not even\r\nthink that she could rest here for ever, she only felt that she rested.\r\nThen she became distinctly conscious that she was lying in the boat\r\nwhich had been bearing her over the waters all through the night.\r\nInstead of bringing her to death, it had been the gently lulling cradle\r\nof a new life. And in spite of her evening despair she was glad that\r\nthe morning had come to her again: glad to think that she was resting\r\nin the familiar sunlight rather than in the unknown regions of death.\r\n_Could_ she not rest here? No sound from Florence would reach her.\r\nAlready oblivion was troubled; from behind the golden haze were\r\npiercing domes and towers and walls, parted by a river and enclosed by\r\nthe green hills.\r\n\r\nShe rose from her reclining posture and sat up in the boat, willing, if\r\nshe could, to resist the rush of thoughts that urged themselves along\r\nwith the conjecture how far the boat had carried her. Why need she\r\nmind? This was a sheltered nook where there were simple villagers who\r\nwould not harm her. For a little while, at least, she might rest and\r\nresolve on nothing. Presently she would go and get some bread and milk,\r\nand then she would nestle in the green quiet, and feel that there was a\r\npause in her life. She turned to watch the crescent-shaped valley, that\r\nshe might get back the soothing sense of peace and beauty which she had\r\nfelt in her first waking.\r\n\r\nShe had not been in this attitude of contemplation more than a few\r\nminutes when across the stillness there came a piercing cry; not a\r\nbrief cry, but continuous and more and more intense. Romola felt sure\r\nit was the cry of a little child in distress that no one came to help.\r\nShe started up and put one foot on the side of the boat ready to leap\r\non to the beach; but she paused there and listened: the mother of the\r\nchild must be near, the cry must soon cease. But it went on, and drew\r\nRomola so irresistibly, seeming the more piteous to her for the sense\r\nof peace which had preceded it, that she jumped on to the beach and\r\nwalked many paces before she knew what direction she would take. The\r\ncry, she thought, came from some rough garden growth many yards on her\r\nright-hand, where she saw a half-ruined hovel. She climbed over a low\r\nbroken stone fence, and made her way across patches of weedy green\r\ncrops and ripe but neglected corn. The cry grew plainer, and convinced\r\nthat she was right she hastened towards the hovel; but even in that\r\nhurried walk she felt an oppressive change in the air as she left the\r\nsea behind. Was there some taint lurking amongst the green luxuriance\r\nthat had seemed such an inviting shelter from the heat of the coming\r\nday? She could see the opening into the hovel now, and the cry was\r\ndarting through her like a pain. The next moment her foot was within\r\nthe doorway, but the sight she beheld in the sombre light arrested her\r\nwith a shock of awe and horror. On the straw, with which the floor was\r\nscattered, lay three dead bodies, one of a tall man, one of a girl\r\nabout eight years old, and one of a young woman whose long black hair\r\nwas being clutched and pulled by a living child\xe2\x80\x94the child that was\r\nsending forth the piercing cry. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s experience in the haunts of\r\ndeath and disease made thought and action prompt: she lifted the little\r\nliving child, and in trying to soothe it on her bosom, still sent to\r\nlook at the bodies and see if they were really dead. The strongly\r\nmarked type of race in their features, and their peculiar garb, made\r\nher conjecture that they were Spanish or Portuguese Jews, who had\r\nperhaps been put ashore and abandoned there by rapacious sailors, to\r\nwhom their property remained as a prey. Such things were happening\r\ncontinually to Jews compelled to abandon their homes by the\r\nInquisition: the cruelty of greed thrust them from the sea, and the\r\ncruelty of superstition thrust them back to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, surely,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall find some woman in the village\r\nwhose mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart will not let her refuse to tend this helpless\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94if the real mother is indeed dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis doubt remained, because while the man and girl looked emaciated\r\nand also showed signs of having been long dead, the woman seemed to\r\nhave been hardier, and had not quite lost the robustness of her form.\r\nRomola, kneeling, was about to lay her hand on the heart; but as she\r\nlifted the piece of yellow woollen drapery that lay across the bosom,\r\nshe saw the purple spots which marked the familiar pestilence. Then it\r\nstruck her that if the villagers knew of this, she might have more\r\ndifficulty than she had expected in getting help from them; they would\r\nperhaps shrink from her with that child in her arms. But she had money\r\nto offer them, and they would not refuse to give her some goat\xe2\x80\x99s milk\r\nin exchange for it.\r\n\r\nShe set out at once towards the village, her mind filled now with the\r\neffort to soothe the little dark creature, and with wondering how she\r\nshould win some woman to be good to it. She could not help hoping a\r\nlittle in a certain awe she had observed herself to inspire, when she\r\nappeared, unknown and unexpected, in her religious dress. As she passed\r\nacross a breadth of cultivated ground, she noticed, with wonder, that\r\nlittle patches of corn mingled with the other crops had been left to\r\nover-ripeness untouched by the sickle, and that golden apples and dark\r\nfigs lay rotting on the weedy earth. There were grassy spaces within\r\nsight, but no cow, or sheep, or goat. The stillness began to have\r\nsomething fearful in it to Romola; she hurried along towards the\r\nthickest cluster of houses, where there would be the most life to\r\nappeal to on behalf of the helpless life she carried in her arms. But\r\nshe had picked up two figs, and bit little pieces from the sweet pulp\r\nto still the child with.\r\n\r\nShe entered between two lines of dwellings. It was time that villagers\r\nshould have been stirring long ago, but not a soul was in sight. The\r\nair was becoming more and more oppressive, laden, it seemed, with some\r\nhorrible impurity. There was a door open; she looked in, and saw grim\r\nemptiness. Another open door; and through that she saw a man lying dead\r\nwith all his garments on, his head lying athwart a spade handle, and an\r\nearthenware cruse in his hand, as if he had fallen suddenly.\r\n\r\nRomola felt horror taking possession of her. Was she in a village of\r\nthe unburied dead? She wanted to listen if there were any faint sound,\r\nbut the child cried out afresh when she ceased to feed it, and the cry\r\nfilled her ears. At last she saw a figure crawling slowly out of a\r\nhouse, and soon sinking back in a sitting posture against the wall. She\r\nhastened towards the figure; it was a young woman in fevered anguish,\r\nand she, too, held a pitcher in her hand. As Romola approached her she\r\ndid not start; the one need was too absorbing for any other idea to\r\nimpress itself on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWater! get me water!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a moaning utterance.\r\n\r\nRomola stooped to take the pitcher, and said gently in her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshall have water; can you point towards the well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hand was lifted towards the more distant end of the little street,\r\nand Romola set off at once with as much speed as she could use under\r\nthe difficulty of carrying the pitcher as well as feeding the child.\r\nBut the little one was getting more content as the morsels of sweet\r\npulp were repeated, and ceased to distress her with its cry, so that\r\nshe could give a less distracted attention to the objects around her.\r\n\r\nThe well lay twenty yards or more beyond the end of the street, and as\r\nRomola was approaching it her eyes were directed to the opposite green\r\nslope immediately below the church. High up, on a patch of grass\r\nbetween the trees, she had descried a cow and a couple of goats, and\r\nshe tried to trace a line of path that would lead her close to that\r\ncheering sight, when once she had done her errand to the well. Occupied\r\nin this way, she was not aware that she was very near the well, and\r\nthat some one approaching it on the other side had fixed a pair of\r\nastonished eyes upon her.\r\n\r\nRomola certainly presented a sight which, at, that moment and in that\r\nplace, could hardly have been seen without some pausing and\r\npalpitation. With her gaze fixed intently on the distant slope, the\r\nlong lines of her thick grey garment giving a gliding character to her\r\nrapid walk, her hair rolling backward and illuminated on the left side\r\nby the sun-rays, the little olive baby on her right arm now looking out\r\nwith jet-black eyes, she might well startle that youth of fifteen,\r\naccustomed to swing the censer in the presence of a Madonna less fair\r\nand marvellous than this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe carries a pitcher in her hand\xe2\x80\x94to fetch water for the sick. It is\r\nthe Holy Mother, come to take care of the people who have the\r\npestilence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a sight of awe: she would, perhaps, be angry with those who\r\nfetched water for themselves only. The youth flung down his vessel in\r\nterror, and Romola, aware now of some one near her, saw the black and\r\nwhite figure fly as if for dear life towards the slope she had just\r\nbeen contemplating. But remembering the parched sufferer, she\r\nhalf-filled her pitcher quickly and hastened back.\r\n\r\nEntering the house to look for a small cup, she saw salt meat and meal:\r\nthere were no signs of want in the dwelling. With nimble movement she\r\nseated baby on the ground, and lifted a cup of water to the sufferer,\r\nwho drank eagerly and then closed her eyes and leaned her head\r\nbackward, seeming to give herself up to the sense of relief. Presently\r\nshe opened her eyes, and, looking at Romola, said languidly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came over the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cI only came this morning. Are all\r\nthe people dead in these houses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they are all ill now\xe2\x80\x94all that are not dead. My father and my\r\nsister lie dead upstairs, and there is no one to bury them: and soon I\r\nshall die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cI am come to take care of you. I am\r\nused to the pestilence; I am not afraid. But there must be some left\r\nwho are not ill. I saw a youth running towards the mountain when I went\r\nto the well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell. When the pestilence came, a great many people went\r\naway, and drove off the cows and goats. Give me more water!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola, suspecting that if she followed the direction of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflight, she should find some men and women who were still healthy and\r\nable, determined to seek them out at once, that she might at least win\r\nthem to take care of the child, and leave her free to come back and see\r\nhow many living needed help, and how many dead needed burial. She\r\ntrusted to her powers of persuasion to conquer the aid of the timorous,\r\nwhen once she knew what was to be done.\r\n\r\nPromising the sick woman to come back to her, she lifted the dark\r\nbantling again, and set off towards the slope. She felt no burden of\r\nchoice on her now, no longing for death. She was thinking how she would\r\ngo to the other sufferers, as she had gone to that fevered woman.\r\n\r\nBut, with the child on her arm, it was not so easy to her as usual to\r\nwalk up a slope, and it seemed a long while before the winding path\r\ntook her near the cow and the goats. She was beginning herself to feel\r\nfaint from heat, hunger, and thirst, and as she reached a double\r\nturning, she paused to consider whether she would not wait near the\r\ncow, which some one was likely to come and milk soon, rather than toil\r\nup to the church before she had taken any rest. Raising her eyes to\r\nmeasure the steep distance, she saw peeping between the boughs, not\r\nmore than five yards off, a broad round face, watching her attentively,\r\nand lower down the black skirt of a priest\xe2\x80\x99s garment, and a hand\r\ngrasping a bucket. She stood mutely observing, and the face, too,\r\nremained motionless. Romola had often witnessed the overpowering force\r\nof dread in cases of pestilence, and she was cautious.\r\n\r\nRaising her voice in a tone of gentle pleading, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI came over\r\nthe sea. I am hungry, and so is the child. Will you not give us some\r\nmilk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola had divined part of the truth, but she had not divined that\r\npreoccupation of the priest\xe2\x80\x99s mind which charged her words with a\r\nstrange significance. Only a little while ago, the young acolyte had\r\nbrought word to the Padre that he had seen the Holy Mother with the\r\nBabe, fetching water for the sick: she was as tall as the cypresses,\r\nand had a light about her head, and she looked up at the church. The\r\npievano (parish priest) had not listened with entire belief: he had\r\nbeen more than fifty years in the world without having any vision of\r\nthe Madonna, and he thought the boy might have misinterpreted the\r\nunexpected appearance of a villager. But he had been made uneasy, and\r\nbefore venturing to come down and milk his cow, he had repeated many\r\nAves. The pievano\xe2\x80\x99s conscience tormented him a little: he trembled at\r\nthe pestilence, but he also trembled at the thought of the mild-faced\r\nMother, conscious that that Invisible Mercy might demand something more\r\nof him than prayers and \xe2\x80\x9cHails.\xe2\x80\x9d In this state of mind\xe2\x80\x94unable to banish\r\nthe image the boy had raised of the Mother with the glory about her\r\ntending the sick\xe2\x80\x94the pievano had come down to milk his cow, and had\r\nsuddenly caught sight of Romola pausing at the parted way. Her pleading\r\nwords, with their strange refinement of tone and accent, instead of\r\nbeing explanatory, had a preternatural sound for him. Yet he did not\r\nquite believe he saw the Holy Mother: he was in a state of alarmed\r\nhesitation. If anything miraculous were happening, he felt there was no\r\nstrong presumption that the miracle would be in his favour. He dared\r\nnot run away; he dared not advance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not fear. Fear rather to\r\ndeny food to the hungry when they ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment after, the boughs were parted, and the complete figure of a\r\nthickset priest with a broad, harmless face, his black frock much worn\r\nand soiled, stood, bucket in hand, looking at her timidly, and still\r\nkeeping aloof as he took the path towards the cow in silence.\r\n\r\nRomola followed him and watched him without speaking again, as he\r\nseated himself against the tethered cow, and, when he had nervously\r\ndrawn some milk, gave it to her in a brass cup he carried with him in\r\nthe bucket. As Romola put the cup to the lips of the eager child, and\r\nafterwards drank some milk herself, the Padre observed her from his\r\nwooden stool with a timidity that changed its character a little. He\r\nrecognised the Hebrew baby, he was certain that he had a substantial\r\nwoman before him; but there was still something strange and\r\nunaccountable in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s presence in this spot, and the Padre had a\r\npresentiment that things were going to change with him. Moreover, that\r\nHebrew baby was terribly associated with the dread of pestilence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when Romola smiled at the little one sucking its own\r\nmilky lips, and stretched out the brass cup again, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGive us\r\nmore, good father,\xe2\x80\x9d he obeyed less nervously than before.\r\n\r\nRomola on her side was not unobservant; and when the second supply of\r\nmilk had been drunk, she looked down at the round-headed man, and said\r\nwith mild decision\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now tell me, father, how this pestilence came, and why you let\r\nyour people die without the sacraments; and lie unburied. For I am come\r\nover the sea to help those who are left alive\xe2\x80\x94and you, too, will help\r\nthem now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told her the story of the pestilence: and while he was telling it,\r\nthe youth, who had fled before, had come peeping and advancing\r\ngradually, till at last he stood and watched the scene from behind a\r\nneighbouring bush.\r\n\r\nThree families of Jews, twenty souls in all, had been put ashore many\r\nweeks ago, some of them already ill of the pestilence. The villagers,\r\nsaid the priest, had of course refused to give shelter to the\r\nmiscreants, otherwise than in a distant hovel, and under heaps of\r\nstraw. But when the strangers had died of the plague, and some of the\r\npeople had thrown the bodies into the sea, the sea had brought them\r\nback again in a great storm, and everybody was smitten with terror. A\r\ngrave was dug, and the bodies were buried; but then the pestilence\r\nattacked the Christians, and the greater number of the villagers went\r\naway over the mountain, driving away their few cattle, and carrying\r\nprovisions. The priest had not fled; he had stayed and prayed for the\r\npeople, and he had prevailed on the youth Jacopo to stay with him; but\r\nhe confessed that a mortal terror of the plague had taken hold of him,\r\nand he had not dared to go down into the valley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will fear no longer, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, in a tone of\r\nencouraging authority; \xe2\x80\x9cyou will come down with me, and we will see who\r\nis living, and we will look for the dead to bury them. I have walked\r\nabout for months where the pestilence was, and see, I am strong. Jacopo\r\nwill come with us,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, motioning to the peeping lad, who came\r\nslowly from behind his defensive bush, as if invisible threads were\r\ndragging him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Jacopo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola again, smiling at him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will carry the\r\nchild for me. See! your arms are strong, and I am tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a dreadful proposal to Jacopo, and to the priest also; but\r\nthey were both under a peculiar influence forcing them to obey. The\r\nsuspicion that Romola was a supernatural form was dissipated, but their\r\nminds were filled instead with the more effective sense that she was a\r\nhuman being whom God had sent over the sea to command them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we will carry down the milk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cand see if any one\r\nwants it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they went all together down the slope, and that morning the\r\nsufferers saw help come to them in their despair. There were hardly\r\nmore than a score alive in the whole valley; but all of these were\r\ncomforted, most were saved, and the dead were buried.\r\n\r\nIn this way days, weeks, and months passed with Romola till the men\r\nwere digging and sowing again, till the women smiled at her as they\r\ncarried their great vases on their heads to the well, and the Hebrew\r\nbaby was a tottering tumbling Christian, Benedetto by name, having been\r\nbaptised in the church on the mountain-side. But by that time she\r\nherself was suffering from the fatigue and languor that must come after\r\na continuous strain on mind and body. She had taken for her dwelling\r\none of the houses abandoned by their owners, standing a little aloof\r\nfrom the village street; and here on a thick heap of clean straw\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndelicious bed for those who do not dream of down\xe2\x80\x94she felt glad to lie\r\nstill through most of the daylight hours, taken care of along with the\r\nlittle Benedetto by a woman whom the pestilence had widowed.\r\n\r\nEvery day the Padre and Jacopo and the small flock of surviving\r\nvillagers paid their visit to this cottage to see the blessed Lady, and\r\nto bring her of their best as an offering\xe2\x80\x94honey, fresh cakes, eggs, and\r\npolenta. It was a sight they could none of them forget, a sight they\r\nall told of in their old age\xe2\x80\x94how the sweet and sainted lady with her\r\nfair face, her golden hair, and her brown eyes that had a blessing in\r\nthem, lay weary with her labours after she had been sent over the sea\r\nto help them in their extremity, and how the queer little black\r\nBenedetto used to crawl about the straw by her side and want everything\r\nthat was brought to her, and she always gave him a bit of what she\r\ntook, and told them if they loved her they must be good to Benedetto.\r\n\r\nMany legends were afterwards told in that valley about the blessed Lady\r\nwho came over the sea, but they were legends by which all who heard\r\nmight know that in times gone by a woman had done beautiful loving\r\ndeeds there, rescuing those who were ready to perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\nHomeward.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those silent wintry hours when Romola lay resting from her\r\nweariness, her mind, travelling back over the past, and gazing across\r\nthe undefined distance of the future, saw all objects from a new\r\nposition. Her experience since the moment of her waking in the boat had\r\ncome to her with as strong an effect as that of the fresh seal on the\r\ndissolving wax. She had felt herself without bonds, without motive;\r\nsinking in mere egoistic complaining that life could bring her no\r\ncontent; feeling a right to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am tired of life, I want to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat thought had sobbed within her as she fell asleep, but from the\r\nmoment after her waking when the cry had drawn her, she had not even\r\nreflected, as she used to do in Florence, that she was glad to live\r\nbecause she could lighten sorrow\xe2\x80\x94she had simply lived, with so\r\nenergetic an impulse to share the life around her, to answer the call\r\nof need and do the work which cried aloud to be done, that the reasons\r\nfor living, enduring, labouring, never took the form of argument.\r\n\r\nThe experience was like a new baptism to Romola. In Florence the\r\nsimpler relations of the human being to his fellow-men had been\r\ncomplicated for her with all the special ties of marriage, the State,\r\nand religious discipleship, and when these had disappointed her trust,\r\nthe shock seemed to have shaken her aloof from life and stunned her\r\nsympathy. But now she said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was mere baseness in me to desire\r\ndeath. If everything else is doubtful, this suffering that I can help\r\nis certain; if the glory of the cross is an illusion, the sorrow is\r\nonly the truer. While the strength is in my arm I will stretch it out\r\nto the fainting; while the light visits my eyes they shall seek the\r\nforsaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the past arose with a fresh appeal to her. Her work in this\r\ngreen valley was done, and the emotions that were disengaged from the\r\npeople immediately around her rushed back into the old deep channels of\r\nuse and affection. That rare possibility of self-contemplation which\r\ncomes in any complete severance from our wonted life made her judge\r\nherself as she had never done before: the compunction which is\r\ninseparable from a sympathetic nature keenly alive to the possible\r\nexperience of others, began to stir in her with growing force. She\r\nquestioned the justness of her own conclusions, of her own deeds: she\r\nhad been rash, arrogant, always dissatisfied that others were not good\r\nenough, while she herself had not been true to what her soul had once\r\nrecognised as the best. She began to condemn her flight: after all, it\r\nhad been cowardly self-care; the grounds on which Savonarola had once\r\ntaken her back were truer, deeper than the grounds she had had for her\r\nsecond flight. How could she feel the needs of others and not feel,\r\nabove all, the needs of the nearest?\r\n\r\nBut then came reaction against such self-reproach. The memory of her\r\nlife with Tito, of the conditions which made their real union\r\nimpossible, while their external union imposed a set of false duties on\r\nher which were essentially the concealment and sanctioning of what her\r\nmind revolted from, told her that flight had been her only resource.\r\nAll minds, except such as are delivered from doubt by dulness of\r\nsensibility, must be subject to this recurring conflict where the\r\nmany-twisted conditions of life have forbidden the fulfilment of a\r\nbond. For in strictness there is no replacing of relations: the\r\npresence of the new does not nullify the failure and breach of the old.\r\nLife has lost its perfection: it has been maimed; and until the wounds\r\nare quite scarred, conscience continually casts backward, doubting\r\nglances.\r\n\r\nRomola shrank with dread from the renewal of her proximity to Tito, and\r\nyet she was uneasy that she had put herself out of reach of knowing\r\nwhat was his fate\xe2\x80\x94uneasy that the moment might yet come when he would\r\nbe in misery and need her. There was still a thread of pain within her,\r\ntestifying to those words of Fra Girolamo, that she could not cease to\r\nbe a wife. Could anything utterly cease for her that had once mingled\r\nitself with the current of her heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood?\r\n\r\nFlorence, and all her life there, had come back to her like hunger; her\r\nfeelings could not go wandering after the possible and the vague: their\r\nliving fibre was fed with the memory of familiar things. And the\r\nthought that she had divided herself from them for ever became more and\r\nmore importunate in these hours that were unfilled with action. What if\r\nFra Girolamo had been wrong? What if the life of Florence was a web of\r\ninconsistencies? Was she, then, something higher, that she should shake\r\nthe dust from off her feet, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis world is not good enough for\r\nme\xe2\x80\x9d? If she had been really higher, she would not so easily have lost\r\nall her trust.\r\n\r\nHer indignant grief for her godfather had no longer complete possession\r\nof her, and her sense of debt to Savonarola was recovering\r\npredominance. Nothing that had come, or was to come, could do away with\r\nthe fact that there had been a great inspiration in him which had waked\r\na new life in her. Who, in all her experience, could demand the same\r\ngratitude from her as he? His errors\xe2\x80\x94might they not bring calamities?\r\n\r\nShe could not rest. She hardly knew whether it was her strength\r\nreturning with the budding leaves that made her active again, or\r\nwhether it was her eager longing to get nearer Florence. She did not\r\nimagine herself daring to enter Florence, but the desire to be near\r\nenough to learn what was happening there urged itself with a strength\r\nthat excluded all other purposes.\r\n\r\nAnd one March morning the people in the valley were gathered together\r\nto see the blessed Lady depart. Jacopo had fetched a mule for her, and\r\nwas going with her over the mountains. The Padre, too, was going with\r\nher to the nearest town, that he might help her in learning the safest\r\nway by which she might get to Pistoja. Her store of trinkets and money,\r\nuntouched in this valley, was abundant for her needs.\r\n\r\nIf Romola had been less drawn by the longing that was taking her away,\r\nit would have been a hard moment for her when she walked along the\r\nvillage street for the last time, while the Padre and Jacopo, with the\r\nmule, were awaiting her near the well. Her steps were hindered by the\r\nwailing people, who knelt and kissed her hands, then clung to her\r\nskirts and kissed the grey folds, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, why will you go, when\r\nthe good season is beginning and the crops will be plentiful? Why will\r\nyou go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are well now, and I shall remember\r\nyou. I must go and see if my own people want me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, if they have the pestilence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at us again, Madonna!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, we will be good to the little Benedetto!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last Romola mounted her mule, but a vigorous screaming from\r\nBenedetto as he saw her turn from him in this new position, was an\r\nexcuse for all the people to follow her and insist that he must ride on\r\nthe mule\xe2\x80\x99s neck to the foot of the slope.\r\n\r\nThe parting must come at last, but as Romola turned continually before\r\nshe passed out of sight, she saw the little flock lingering to catch\r\nthe last waving of her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\nMeeting Again.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of April Romola was once more within the walls of\r\nFlorence. Unable to rest at Pistoja, where contradictory reports\r\nreached her about the Trial by Fire, she had gone on to Prato; and was\r\nbeginning to think that she should be drawn on to Florence in spite of\r\ndread, when she encountered that monk of San Spirito who had been her\r\ngodfather\xe2\x80\x99s confessor. From him she learned the full story of\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, and of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death. This Augustinian monk\r\nhad been in the stream of people who had followed the waggon with its\r\nawful burthen into the Piazza, and he could tell her what was generally\r\nknown in Florence\xe2\x80\x94that Tito had escaped from an assaulting mob by\r\nleaping into the Arno, but had been murdered on the bank by an old man\r\nwho had long had an enmity against him. But Romola understood the\r\ncatastrophe as no one else did. Of Savonarola the monk told her, in\r\nthat tone of unfavourable prejudice which was usual in the Black\r\nBrethren (Frati Neri) towards the brother who showed white under his\r\nblack, that he had confessed himself a deceiver of the people.\r\n\r\nRomola paused no longer. That evening she was in Florence, sitting in\r\nagitated silence under the exclamations of joy and wailing, mingled\r\nwith exuberant narrative, which were poured into her ears by Monna\r\nBrigida, who had backslided into false hair in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s absence, but\r\nnow drew it off again and declared she would not mind being grey, if\r\nher dear child would stay with her.\r\n\r\nRomola was too deeply moved by the main events which she had known\r\nbefore coming to Florence, to be wrought upon by the doubtful gossiping\r\ndetails added in Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s narrative. The tragedy of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, of Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s confession of duplicity under the coercion of\r\ntorture, left her hardly any power of apprehending minor circumstances.\r\nAll the mental activity she could exert under that load of awe-stricken\r\ngrief, was absorbed by two purposes which must supersede every other;\r\nto try and see Savonarola, and to learn what had become of Tessa and\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said abruptly, when Monna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s tongue had\r\nrun quite away from troubles into projects of Romola\xe2\x80\x99s living with her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chas anything been seen or said since Tito\xe2\x80\x99s death of a young woman\r\nwith two little children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrigida started, rounded her eyes, and lifted up her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCristo! no. What! was he so bad as that, my poor child? Ah, then, that\r\nwas why you went away, and left me word only that you went of your own\r\nfree will. Well, well; if I\xe2\x80\x99d known that, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought you\r\nso strange and flighty. For I did say to myself, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nanybody else, \xe2\x80\x98What was she to go away from her husband for, leaving\r\nhim to mischief, only because they cut poor Bernardo\xe2\x80\x99s head off? She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot her father\xe2\x80\x99s temper,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, well;\r\nnever scold me, child: Bardo _was_ fierce, you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. But if\r\nyou had only told me the truth, that there was a young hussey and\r\nchildren, I should have understood it all. Anything seen or said of\r\nher? No; and the less the better. They say enough of ill about him\r\nwithout that. But since that was the reason you went\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, interrupting her earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cpray do\r\nnot talk so. I wish above all things to find that young woman and her\r\nchildren, and to take care of them. They are quite helpless. Say\r\nnothing against it; that is the thing I shall do first of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monna Brigida, shrugging her shoulders and lowering her\r\nvoice with an air of puzzled discomfiture, \xe2\x80\x9cif that\xe2\x80\x99s being a Piagnone,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking peas for paternosters. Why, Fra Girolamo said as good\r\nas that widows ought not to marry again. Step in at the door and it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsin and a shame, it seems; but come down the chimney and you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwelcome. _Two_ children\xe2\x80\x94Santiddio!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin, the poor thing has done no conscious wrong: she is ignorant of\r\neverything. I will tell you\xe2\x80\x94but not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Romola\xe2\x80\x99s steps were directed to the house beyond\r\nSan Ambrogio where she had once found Tessa; but it was as she had\r\nfeared: Tessa was gone. Romola conjectured that Tito had sent her away\r\nbeforehand to some spot where he had intended to join her, for she did\r\nnot believe that he would willingly part with those children. It was a\r\npainful conjecture, because, if Tessa were out of Florence, there was\r\nhardly a chance of finding her, and Romola pictured the childish\r\ncreature waiting and waiting at some wayside spot in wondering,\r\nhelpless misery. Those who lived near could tell her nothing except\r\nthat old deaf Lisa had gone away a week ago with her goods, but no one\r\nknew where Tessa had gone. Romola saw no further active search open to\r\nher; for she had no knowledge that could serve as a starting-point for\r\ninquiry, and not only her innate reserve but a more noble sensitiveness\r\nmade her shrink from assuming an attitude of generosity in the eyes of\r\nothers by publishing Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s relation to Tito, along with her own\r\ndesire to find her. Many days passed in anxious inaction. Even under\r\nstrong solicitation from other thoughts Romola found her heart\r\npalpitating if she caught sight of a pair of round brown legs, or of a\r\nshort woman in the contadina dress.\r\n\r\nShe never for a moment told herself that it was heroism or exalted\r\ncharity in her to seek these beings; she needed something that she was\r\nbound specially to care for; she yearned to clasp the children and to\r\nmake them love her. This at least would be some sweet result, for\r\nothers as well as herself, from all her past sorrow. It appeared there\r\nwas much property of Tito\xe2\x80\x99s to which she had a claim; but she\r\ndistrusted the cleanness of that money, and she had determined to make\r\nit all over to the State, except so much as was equal to the price of\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s library. This would be enough for the modest support of\r\nTessa and the children. But Monna Brigida threw such planning into the\r\nbackground by clamorously insisting that Romola must live with her and\r\nnever forsake her till she had seen her safe in Paradise\xe2\x80\x94else why had\r\nshe persuaded her to turn Piagnone?\xe2\x80\x94and if Romola wanted to rear other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s children, she, Monna Brigida, must rear them too. Only they\r\nmust be found first.\r\n\r\nRomola felt the full force of that innuendo. But strong feeling\r\nunsatisfied is never without its superstition, either of hope or\r\ndespair. Romola\xe2\x80\x99s was the superstition of hope: _somehow_ she was to\r\nfind that mother and the children. And at last another direction for\r\nactive inquiry suggested itself. She learned that Tito had provided\r\nhorses and mules to await him in San Gallo; he was therefore going to\r\nleave Florence by the gate of San Gallo, and she determined, though\r\nwithout much confidence in the issue, to try and ascertain from the\r\ngatekeepers if they had observed any one corresponding to the\r\ndescription of Tessa with her children, to have passed the gates before\r\nthe morning of the ninth of April. Walking along the Via San Gallo, and\r\nlooking watchfully about her through her long widow\xe2\x80\x99s veil, lest she\r\nshould miss any object that might aid her, she descried Bratti\r\nchaffering with a customer. That roaming man, she thought, might aid\r\nher: she would not mind talking of Tessa to _him_. But as she put aside\r\nher veil and crossed the street towards him, she saw something hanging\r\nfrom the corner of his basket which made her heart leap with a much\r\nstronger hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBratti, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere did you get that\r\nnecklace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour servant, madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, looking round at her very\r\ndeliberately, his mind not being subject to surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a necklace\r\nworth money, but I shall get little by it, for my heart\xe2\x80\x99s too tender\r\nfor a trader\xe2\x80\x99s; I have promised to keep it in pledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray tell me where you got it;\xe2\x80\x94from a little woman named Tessa, is it\r\nnot true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! if you know her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bratti, \xe2\x80\x9cand would redeem it of me at a\r\nsmall profit, and give it her again, you\xe2\x80\x99d be doing a charity, for she\r\ncried at parting with it\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d have thought she was running into a\r\nbrook. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small profit I\xe2\x80\x99ll charge you. You shall have it for a\r\nflorin, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be hard-hearted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, giving him the money, and unclasping the\r\nnecklace from the basket in joyful agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOutside the gate there, at the other end of the Borgo, at old Sibilla\r\nManetti\xe2\x80\x99s: anybody will tell you which is the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola went along with winged feet, blessing that incident of the\r\nCarnival which had made her learn by heart the appearance of this\r\nnecklace. Soon she was at the house she sought. The young woman and the\r\nchildren were in the inner room\xe2\x80\x94were to have been fetched away a\r\nfortnight ago and more\xe2\x80\x94had no money, only their clothes, to pay a poor\r\nwidow with for their food and lodging. But since madonna knew them\xe2\x80\x94\r\nRomola waited to hear no more, but opened the door.\r\n\r\nTessa was seated on the low bed: her crying had passed into tearless\r\nsobs, and she was looking with sad blank eyes at the two children, who\r\nwere playing in an opposite corner\xe2\x80\x94Lillo covering his head with his\r\nskirt and roaring at Ninna to frighten her, then peeping out again to\r\nsee how she bore it. The door was a little behind Tessa, and she did\r\nnot turn round when it opened, thinking it was only the old woman:\r\nexpectation was no longer alive. Romola had thrown aside her veil and\r\npaused a moment, holding the necklace in sight. Then she said, in that\r\npure voice that used to cheer her father\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTessa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTessa started to her feet and looked round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, clasping the beads on Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s neck, \xe2\x80\x9cGod has sent\r\nme to you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor thing screamed and sobbed, and clung to the arms that fastened\r\nthe necklace. She could not speak. The two children came from their\r\ncorner, laid hold of their mother\xe2\x80\x99s skirts, and looked up with wide\r\neyes at Romola.\r\n\r\nThat day they all went home to Monna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s, in the Borgo degli\r\nAlbizzi. Romola had made known to Tessa, by gentle degrees, that Naldo\r\ncould never come to her again: not because he was cruel, but because he\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut be comforted, my Tessa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cI am come to take care of\r\nyou always. And we have got Lillo and Ninna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonna Brigida\xe2\x80\x99s mouth twitched in the struggle between her awe of\r\nRomola and the desire to speak unseasonably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet be, for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems to me a thousand\r\nyears till I tell this little contadina, who seems not to know how many\r\nfingers she\xe2\x80\x99s got on her hand, who Romola is. And I _will_ tell her\r\nsome day, else she\xe2\x80\x99ll never know her place. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for\r\nRomola;\xe2\x80\x94nobody will call their souls their own when she\xe2\x80\x99s by; but if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m to have this puss-faced minx living in my house she must be humble\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, Monna Brigida wanted to give the children too many sweets for\r\ntheir supper, and confessed to Romola, the last thing before going to\r\nbed, that it would be a shame not to take care of such cherubs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must give up to me a little, Romola, about their eating, and\r\nthose things. For you have never had a baby, and I had twins, only they\r\ndied as soon as they were born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\nThe Confession.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Romola brought home Tessa and the children, April was already near\r\nits close, and the other great anxiety on her mind had been wrought to\r\nits highest pitch by the publication in print of Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s Trial,\r\nor rather of the confessions drawn from him by the sixteen Florentine\r\ncitizens commissioned to interrogate him. The appearance of this\r\ndocument, issued by order of the Signoria, had called forth such strong\r\nexpressions of public suspicion and discontent, that severe measures\r\nwere immediately taken for recalling it. Of course there were copies\r\naccidentally mislaid, and a second edition, _not_ by order of the\r\nSignoria, was soon in the hands of eager readers.\r\n\r\nRomola, who began to despair of ever speaking with Fra Girolamo, read\r\nthis evidence again and again, desiring to judge it by some clearer\r\nlight than the contradictory impressions that were taking the form of\r\nassertions in the mouths of both partisans and enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the more devout followers of Savonarola his want of constancy under\r\ntorture, and his retraction of prophetic claims, had produced a\r\nconsternation too profound to be at once displaced as it ultimately was\r\nby the suspicion, which soon grew into a positive datum, that any\r\nreported words of his which were in inexplicable contradiction to their\r\nfaith in him, had not come from the lips of the prophet, but from the\r\nfalsifying pen of Ser Ceccone, that notary of evil repute, who had made\r\nthe digest of the examination. But there were obvious facts that at\r\nonce threw discredit on the printed document. Was not the list of\r\nsixteen examiners half made up of the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s bitterest enemies? Was\r\nnot the notorious Dolfo Spini one of the new Eight prematurely elected,\r\nin order to load the dice against a man whose ruin had been determined\r\non by the party in power? It was but a murder with slow formalities\r\nthat was being transacted in the Old Palace. The Signoria had resolved\r\nto drive a good bargain with the Pope and the Duke of Milan, by\r\nextinguishing the man who was as great a molestation to vicious\r\ncitizens and greedy foreign tyrants as to a corrupt clergy. The Frate\r\nhad been doomed beforehand, and the only question that was pretended to\r\nexist now was, whether the Republic, in return for a permission to lay\r\na tax on ecclesiastical property, should deliver him alive into the\r\nhands of the Pope, or whether the Pope should further concede to the\r\nRepublic what its dignity demanded\xe2\x80\x94the privilege of hanging and burning\r\nits own prophet on its own piazza.\r\n\r\nWho, under such circumstances, would give full credit to this so-called\r\nconfession? If the Frate had denied his prophetic gift, the denial had\r\nonly been wrenched from him by the agony of torture\xe2\x80\x94agony that, in his\r\nsensitive frame, must quickly produce raving. What if these wicked\r\nexaminers declared that he had only had the torture of the rope and\r\npulley thrice, and only on one day, and that his confessions had been\r\nmade when he was under no bodily coercion\xe2\x80\x94was that to be believed? He\r\nhad been tortured much more; he had been tortured in proportion to the\r\ndistress his confessions had created in the hearts of those who loved\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOther friends of Savonarola, who were less ardent partisans, did not\r\ndoubt the substantial genuineness of the confession, however it might\r\nhave been coloured by the transpositions and additions of the notary;\r\nbut they argued indignantly that there was nothing which could warrant\r\na condemnation to death, or even to grave punishment. It must be clear\r\nto all impartial men that if this examination represented the only\r\nevidence against the Frate, he would die, not for any crime, but\r\nbecause he had made himself inconvenient to the Pope, to the rapacious\r\nItalian States that wanted to dismember their Tuscan neighbour, and to\r\nthose unworthy citizens who sought to gratify their private ambition in\r\nopposition to the common weal.\r\n\r\nNot a shadow of political crime had been proved against him. Not one\r\nstain had been detected on his private conduct: his fellow-monks,\r\nincluding one who had formerly been his secretary for several years,\r\nand who, with more than the average culture of his companions, had a\r\ndisposition to criticise Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s rule as Prior, bore testimony,\r\neven after the shock of his retraction, to an unimpeachable purity and\r\nconsistency in his life, which had commanded their unsuspecting\r\nveneration. The Pope himself had not been able to raise a charge of\r\nheresy against the Frate, except on the ground of disobedience to a\r\nmandate, and disregard of the sentence of excommunication. It was\r\ndifficult to justify that breach of discipline by argument, but there\r\nwas a moral insurgence in the minds of grave men against the Court of\r\nRome, which tended to confound the theoretic distinction between the\r\nChurch and churchmen, and to lighten the scandal of disobedience.\r\n\r\nMen of ordinary morality and public spirit felt that the triumph of the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s enemies was really the triumph of gross licence. And keen\r\nFlorentines like Soderini and Piero Guicciardini may well have had an\r\nangry smile on their lips at a severity which dispensed with all law in\r\norder to hang and burn a man in whom the seductions of a public career\r\nhad warped the strictness of his veracity; may well have remarked that\r\nif the Frate had mixed a much deeper fraud with a zeal and ability less\r\ninconvenient to high personages, the fraud would have been regarded as\r\nan excellent oil for ecclesiastical and political wheels.\r\n\r\nNevertheless such shrewd men were forced to admit that, however poor a\r\nfigure the Florentine government made in its clumsy pretence of a\r\njudicial warrant for what had in fact been predetermined as an act of\r\npolicy, the measures of the Pope against Savonarola were necessary\r\nmeasures of self-defence. Not to try and rid himself of a man who\r\nwanted to stir up the Powers of Europe to summon a General Council and\r\ndepose him, would have been adding ineptitude to iniquity. There was no\r\ndenying that towards Alexander the Sixth Savonarola was a rebel, and,\r\nwhat was much more, a dangerous rebel. Florence had heard him say, and\r\nhad well understood what he meant, that he would not _obey the devil_.\r\nIt was inevitably a life and death struggle between the Frate and the\r\nPope; but it was less inevitable that Florence should make itself the\r\nPope\xe2\x80\x99s executioner.\r\n\r\nRomola\xe2\x80\x99s ears were filled in this way with the suggestions of a faith\r\nstill ardent under its wounds, and the suggestions of worldly\r\ndiscernment, judging things according to a very moderate standard of\r\nwhat is possible to human nature. She could be satisfied with neither.\r\nShe brought to her long meditations over that printed document many\r\npainful observations, registered more or less consciously through the\r\nyears of her discipleship, which whispered a presentiment that\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s retraction of his prophetic claims was not merely a\r\nspasmodic effort to escape from torture. But, on the other hand, her\r\nsoul cried out for some explanation of his lapses which would make it\r\nstill possible for her to believe that the main striving of his life\r\nhad been pure and grand. The recent memory of the selfish discontent\r\nwhich had come over her like a blighting wind along with the loss of\r\nher trust in the man who had been for her an incarnation of the highest\r\nmotives, had produced a reaction which is known to many as a sort of\r\nfaith that has sprung up to them out of the very depths of their\r\ndespair. It was impossible, she said now, that the negative\r\ndisbelieving thoughts which had made her soul arid of all good, could\r\nbe founded in the truth of things: impossible that it had not been a\r\nliving spirit, and no hollow pretence, which had once breathed in the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s words, and kindled a new life in her. Whatever falsehood there\r\nhad been in him, had been a fall and not a purpose; a gradual\r\nentanglement in which he struggled, not a contrivance encouraged by\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nLooking at the printed confessions, she saw many sentences which bore\r\nthe stamp of bungling fabrication: they had that emphasis and\r\nrepetition in self-accusation which none but very low hypocrites use to\r\ntheir fellow-men. But the fact that these sentences were in striking\r\nopposition, not only to the character of Savonarola, but also to the\r\ngeneral tone of the confessions, strengthened the impression that the\r\nrest of the text represented in the main what had really fallen from\r\nhis lips. Hardly a word was dishonourable to him except what turned on\r\nhis prophetic annunciations. He was unvarying in his statement of the\r\nends he had pursued for Florence, the Church, and the world; and, apart\r\nfrom the mixture of falsity in that claim to special inspiration by\r\nwhich he sought to gain hold of men\xe2\x80\x99s minds, there was no admission of\r\nhaving used unworthy means. Even in this confession, and without\r\nexpurgation of the notary\xe2\x80\x99s malign phrases, Fra Girolamo shone forth as\r\na man who had sought his own glory indeed, but sought it by labouring\r\nfor the very highest end\xe2\x80\x94the moral welfare of men\xe2\x80\x94not by vague\r\nexhortations, but by striving to turn beliefs into energies that would\r\nwork in all the details of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything that I have done,\xe2\x80\x9d said one memorable passage, which may\r\nperhaps have had its erasures and interpolations, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done with the\r\ndesign of being for ever famous in the present and in future ages; and\r\nthat I might win credit in Florence; and that nothing of great import\r\nshould be done without my sanction. And when I had thus established my\r\nposition in Florence, I had it in my mind to do great things in Italy\r\nand beyond Italy, by means of those chief personages with whom I had\r\ncontracted friendship and consulted on high matters, such as this of\r\nthe General Council. And in proportion as my first efforts succeeded, I\r\nshould have adopted further measures. Above all, when the General\r\nCouncil had once been brought about, I intended to rouse the princes of\r\nChristendom, and especially those beyond the borders of Italy, to\r\nsubdue the infidels. It was not much in my thoughts to get myself made\r\na Cardinal or Pope, for when I should have achieved the work I had in\r\nview, I should, without being Pope, have been the first man in the\r\nworld in the authority I should have possessed, and the reverence that\r\nwould have been paid me. If I had been made Pope, I would not have\r\nrefused the office: but it seemed to me that to be the head of that\r\nwork was a greater thing than to be Pope, because a man without virtue\r\nmay be Pope; but _such a work as I contemplated demanded a man of\r\nexcellent virtues_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat blending of ambition with belief in the supremacy of goodness made\r\nno new tone to Romola, who had been used to hear it in the voice that\r\nrang through the Duomo. It was the habit of Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s mind to\r\nconceive great things, and to feel that he was the man to do them.\r\nIniquity should be brought low; the cause of justice, purity, and love\r\nshould triumph; and it should triumph by his voice, by his work, by his\r\nblood. In moments of ecstatic contemplation, doubtless, the sense of\r\nself melted in the sense of the Unspeakable, and in that part of his\r\nexperience lay the elements of genuine self-abasement; but in the\r\npresence of his fellow-men for whom he was to act, pre-eminence seemed\r\na necessary condition of his life.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps this confession, even when it described a doubleness that\r\nwas conscious and deliberate, really implied no more than that wavering\r\nof belief concerning his own impressions and motives which most human\r\nbeings who have not a stupid inflexibility of self-confidence must be\r\nliable to under a marked change of external conditions. In a life where\r\nthe experience was so tumultuously mixed as it must have been in the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s, what a possibility was opened for a change of self-judgment,\r\nwhen, instead of eyes that venerated and knees that knelt, instead of a\r\ngreat work on its way to accomplishment, and in its prosperity stamping\r\nthe agent as a chosen instrument, there came the hooting and the\r\nspitting and the curses of the crowd; and then the hard faces of\r\nenemies made judges; and then the horrible torture, and with the\r\ntorture the irrepressible cry, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, what you would have me say:\r\nlet me go: do not torture me again: yes, yes, I am guilty. O God! Thy\r\nstroke has reached me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Romola thought of the anguish that must have followed the\r\nconfession\xe2\x80\x94whether, in the subsequent solitude of the prison,\r\nconscience retracted or confirmed the self-taxing words\xe2\x80\x94that anguish\r\nseemed to be pressing on her own heart and urging the slow bitter\r\ntears. Every vulgar self-ignorant person in Florence was glibly\r\npronouncing on this man\xe2\x80\x99s demerits, while _he_ was knowing a depth of\r\nsorrow which can only be known to the soul that has loved and sought\r\nthe most perfect thing, and beholds itself fallen.\r\n\r\nShe had not then seen\xe2\x80\x94what she saw afterwards\xe2\x80\x94the evidence of the\r\nFrate\xe2\x80\x99s mental state after he had had thus to lay his mouth in the\r\ndust. As the days went by, the reports of new unpublished examinations,\r\neliciting no change of confessions, ceased; Savonarola was left alone\r\nin his prison and allowed pen and ink for a while, that, if he liked,\r\nhe might use his poor bruised and strained right arm to write with. He\r\nwrote; but what he wrote was no vindication of his innocence, no\r\nprotest against the proceedings used towards him: it was a continued\r\ncolloquy with that divine purity with which he sought complete reunion;\r\nit was the outpouring of self-abasement; it was one long cry for inward\r\nrenovation. No lingering echoes of the old vehement self-assertion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at my work, for it is good, and those who set their faces against\r\nit are the children of the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice of Sadness tells him, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\nplaced thee in the midst of the people even as if thou hadst been one\r\nof the excellent. In this way thou hast taught others, and hast failed\r\nto learn thyself. Thou hast cured others: and thou thyself hast been\r\nstill diseased. Thy heart was lifted up at the beauty of thy own deeds,\r\nand through this thou hast lost thy wisdom and art become, and shalt be\r\nto all eternity, nothing... After so many benefits with which God has\r\nhonoured thee, thou art fallen into the depths of the sea; and after so\r\nmany gifts bestowed on thee, thou, by thy pride and vainglory, hast\r\nscandalised all the world.\xe2\x80\x9d And when Hope speaks and argues that the\r\ndivine love has not forsaken him, it says nothing now of a great work\r\nto be done, but only says, \xe2\x80\x9cThou art not forsaken, else why is thy\r\nheart bowed in penitence? That too is a gift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is no jot of worthy evidence that from the time of his\r\nimprisonment to the supreme moment, Savonarola thought or spoke of\r\nhimself as a martyr. The idea of martyrdom had been to him a passion\r\ndividing the dream of the future with the triumph of beholding his work\r\nachieved. And now, in place of both, had come a resignation which he\r\ncalled by no glorifying name.\r\n\r\n_But therefore he may the more fitly be called a martyr by his\r\nfellow-men to all time_. For power rose against him not because of his\r\nsins, but because of his greatness\xe2\x80\x94not because he sought to deceive the\r\nworld, but because he sought to make it noble. And through that\r\ngreatness of his he endured a double agony: not only the reviling, and\r\nthe torture, and the death-throe, but the agony of sinking from the\r\nvision of glorious achievement into that deep shadow where he could\r\nonly say, \xe2\x80\x9cI count as nothing: darkness encompasses me: yet the light I\r\nsaw was the true light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\nThe Last Silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomola had seemed to hear, as if they had been a cry, the words\r\nrepeated to her by many lips\xe2\x80\x94the words uttered by Savonarola when he\r\ntook leave of those brethren of San Marco who had come to witness his\r\nsignature of the confession: \xe2\x80\x9cPray for me, for God has withdrawn from\r\nme the spirit of prophecy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words had shaken her with new doubts as to the mode in which he\r\nlooked back at the past in moments of complete self-possession. And the\r\ndoubts were strengthened by more piteous things still, which soon\r\nreached her ears.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth of May had come, and by that day\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine there had\r\nentered into Florence the two Papal Commissaries, charged with the\r\ncompletion of Savonarola\xe2\x80\x99s trial. They entered amid the acclamations of\r\nthe people, calling for the death of the Frate. For now the popular cry\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Frate\xe2\x80\x99s deception that has brought on all our\r\nmisfortunes; let him be burned, and all things right will be done, and\r\nour evils will cease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day it is well certified that there was fresh and fresh\r\ntorture of the shattered sensitive frame; and now, at the first sight\r\nof the horrible implements, Savonarola, in convulsed agitation, fell on\r\nhis knees, and in brief passionate words _retracted his confession_,\r\ndeclared that he had spoken falsely in denying his prophetic gift, and\r\nthat if he suffered, he would suffer for the truth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe things that I\r\nhave spoken, I had them from God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut not the less the torture was laid upon him, and when he was under\r\nit he was asked why he had uttered those retracting words. Men were not\r\ndemons in those days, and yet nothing but concessions of guilt were\r\nheld a reason for release from torture. The answer came: \xe2\x80\x9cI said it\r\nthat I might seem good; tear me no more, I will tell you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were Florentine assessors at this new trial, and those words of\r\ntwofold retraction had soon spread. They filled Romola with dismayed\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it flashed across her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere will come a moment when he may\r\nspeak. When there is no dread hanging over him but the dread of\r\nfalsehood, when they have brought him into the presence of death, when\r\nhe is lifted above the people, and looks on them for the last time,\r\nthey cannot hinder him from speaking a last decisive word. I will be\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree days after, on the 23rd of May 1498, there was again a long\r\nnarrow platform stretching across the great piazza, from the Palazzo\r\nVecchio towards the Tetta de\xe2\x80\x99 Pisani. But there was no grove of fuel as\r\nbefore: instead of that, there was one great heap of fuel placed on the\r\ncircular area which made the termination of the long narrow platform.\r\nAnd above this heap of fuel rose a gibbet with three halters on it; a\r\ngibbet which, having two arms, still looked so much like a cross as to\r\nmake some beholders uncomfortable, though one arm had been truncated to\r\navoid the resemblance.\r\n\r\nOn the marble terrace of the Palazzo were three tribunals; one near the\r\ndoor for the Bishop, who was to perform the ceremony of degradation on\r\nFra Girolamo and the two brethren who were to suffer as his followers\r\nand accomplices; another for the Papal Commissaries, who were to\r\npronounce them heretics and schismatics, and deliver them over to the\r\nsecular arm; and a third, close to Marzocco, at the corner of the\r\nterrace where the platform began, for the Gonfaloniere, and the Eight\r\nwho were to pronounce the sentence of death.\r\n\r\nAgain the Piazza was thronged with expectant faces: again there was to\r\nbe a great fire kindled. In the majority of the crowd that pressed\r\naround the gibbet the expectation was that of ferocious hatred, or of\r\nmere hard curiosity to behold a barbarous sight. But there were still\r\nmany spectators on the wide pavement, on the roofs, and at the windows,\r\nwho, in the midst of their bitter grief and their own endurance of\r\ninsult as hypocritical Piagnoni, were not without a lingering hope,\r\neven at this eleventh hour, that God would interpose, by some sign, to\r\nmanifest their beloved prophet as His servant. And there were yet more\r\nwho looked forward with trembling eagerness, as Romola did, to that\r\nfinal moment when Savonarola might say, \xe2\x80\x9cO people, I was innocent of\r\ndeceit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola was at a window on the north side of the Piazza, far away from\r\nthe marble terrace where the tribunals stood; and near her, also\r\nlooking on in painful doubt concerning the man who had won his early\r\nreverence, was a young Florentine of two-and-twenty, named Jacopo\r\nNardi, afterwards to deserve honour as one of the very few who, feeling\r\nFra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x99s eminence, have written about him with the simple desire\r\nto be veracious. He had said to Romola, with respectful gentleness,\r\nwhen he saw the struggle in her between her shuddering horror of the\r\nscene and her yearning to witness what might happen in the last moment\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadonna, there is no need for you to look at these cruel things. I\r\nwill tell you when he comes out of the Palazzo. Trust to me; I know\r\nwhat you would see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola covered her face, but the hootings that seemed to make the\r\nhideous scene still visible could not be shut out. At last her arm was\r\ntouched, and she heard the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHe comes.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked towards the\r\nPalace, and could see Savonarola led out in his Dominican garb; could\r\nsee him standing before the Bishop, and being stripped of the black\r\nmantle, the white scapulary and long white tunic, till he stood in a\r\nclose woollen under-tunic, that told of no sacred office, no rank. He\r\nhad been degraded, and cut off from the Church Militant.\r\n\r\nThe baser part of the multitude delight in degradations, apart from any\r\nhatred; it is the satire they best understand. There was a fresh hoot\r\nof triumph as the three degraded brethren passed on to the tribunal of\r\nthe Papal Commissaries, who were to pronounce them schismatics and\r\nheretics. Did not the prophet look like a schismatic and heretic now?\r\nIt is easy to believe in the damnable state of a man who stands\r\nstripped and degraded.\r\n\r\nThen the third tribunal was passed\xe2\x80\x94that of the Florentine officials who\r\nwere to pronounce sentence, and amongst whom, even at her distance,\r\nRomola could discern the odious figure of Dolfo Spini, indued in the\r\ngrave black lucco, as one of the Eight.\r\n\r\nThen the three figures, in their close white raiment, trod their way\r\nalong the platform, amidst yells and grating tones of insult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCover your eyes, Madonna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacopo Nardi; \xe2\x80\x9cFra Girolamo will be\r\nthe last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not long before she had to uncover them again. Savonarola was\r\nthere. He was not far off her now. He had mounted the steps; she could\r\nsee him look round on the multitude.\r\n\r\nBut in the same moment expectation died, and she only saw what he was\r\nseeing\xe2\x80\x94torches waving to kindle the fuel beneath his dead body, faces\r\nglaring with a yet worse light; she only heard what _he_ was\r\nhearing\xe2\x80\x94gross jests, taunts, and curses.\r\n\r\nThe moment was past. Her face was covered again, and she only knew that\r\nSavonarola\xe2\x80\x99s voice had passed into eternal silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 22nd of May 1509, five persons, of whose history\r\nwe have known something, were seated in a handsome upper room opening\r\non to a loggia which, at its right-hand corner, looked all along the\r\nBorgo Pinti, and over the city gate towards Fiesole and the solemn\r\nheights beyond it.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the room was an archway opening into a narrow inner room,\r\nhardly more than a recess, where the light fell from above on a small\r\naltar covered with fair white linen. Over the altar was a picture,\r\ndiscernible at the distance where the little party sat only as the\r\nsmall full-length portrait of a Dominican Brother. For it was shaded\r\nfrom the light above by overhanging branches and wreaths of flowers,\r\nand the fresh tapers below it were unlit. But it seemed that the\r\ndecoration of the altar and its recess was not complete. For part of\r\nthe floor was strewn with a confusion of flowers and green boughs, and\r\namong them sat a delicate blue-eyed girl of thirteen, tossing her long\r\nlight-brown hair out of her eyes, as she made selections for the\r\nwreaths she was weaving, or looked up at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s work in the same\r\nkind, and told her how to do it with a little air of instruction.\r\n\r\nFor that mother was not very clever at weaving flowers or at any other\r\nwork. Tessa\xe2\x80\x99s fingers had not become more adroit with the years\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nvery much fatter. She got on slowly and turned her head about a good\r\ndeal, and asked Ninna\xe2\x80\x99s opinion with much deference; for Tessa never\r\nceased to be astonished at the wisdom of her children. She still wore\r\nher contadina gown: it was only broader than the old one; and there was\r\nthe silver pin in her rough curly brown hair, and round her neck the\r\nmemorable necklace, with a red cord under it, that ended mysteriously\r\nin her bosom. Her rounded face wore even a more perfect look of\r\nchildish content than in her younger days: everybody was so good in the\r\nworld, Tessa thought; even Monna Brigida never found fault with her\r\nnow, and did little else than sleep, which was an amiable practice in\r\neverybody, and one that Tessa liked for herself.\r\n\r\nMonna Brigida was asleep at this moment, in a straight-backed\r\narm-chair, a couple of yards off. Her hair, parting backward under her\r\nblack hood, had that soft whiteness which is not like snow or anything\r\nelse, but is simply the lovely whiteness of aged hair. Her chin had\r\nsunk on her bosom, and her hands rested on the elbow of her chair. She\r\nhad not been weaving flowers or doing anything else: she had only been\r\nlooking on as usual, and as usual had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nThe other two figures were seated farther off, at the wide doorway that\r\nopened on to the loggia. Lillo sat on the ground with his back against\r\nthe angle of the door-post, and his long legs stretched out, while he\r\nheld a large book open on his knee, and occasionally made a dash with\r\nhis hand at an inquisitive fly, with an air of interest stronger than\r\nthat excited by the finely-printed copy of Petrarch which he kept open\r\nat one place, as if he were learning something by heart.\r\n\r\nRomola sat nearly opposite Lillo, but she was not observing him. Her\r\nhands were crossed on her lap and her eyes were fixed absently on the\r\ndistant mountains: she was evidently unconscious of anything around\r\nher. An eager life had left its marks upon her: the finely-moulded\r\ncheek had sunk a little, the golden crown was less massive; but there\r\nwas a placidity in Romola\xe2\x80\x99s face which had never belonged to it in\r\nyouth. It is but once that we can know our worst sorrows, and Romola\r\nhad known them while life was new.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in this way, she was not at first aware that Lillo had ceased\r\nto look at his book, and was watching her with a slightly impatient\r\nair, which meant that he wanted to talk to her, but was not quite sure\r\nwhether she would like that entertainment just now. But persevering\r\nlooks make themselves felt at last. Romola did presently turn away her\r\neyes from the distance and met Lillo\xe2\x80\x99s impatient dark gaze with a\r\nbrighter and brighter smile. He shuffled along the floor, still keeping\r\nthe book on his lap, till he got close to her and lodged his chin on\r\nher knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Lillo?\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola, pulling his hair back from his brow.\r\nLillo was a handsome lad, but his features were turning out to be more\r\nmassive and less regular than his father\xe2\x80\x99s. The blood of the Tuscan\r\npeasant was in his veins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma. Romola, what am I to be?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, well contented that there\r\nwas a prospect of talking till it would be too late to con \xe2\x80\x9cSpirto\r\ngentil\xe2\x80\x9d any longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should you like to be, Lillo? You might be a scholar. My father\r\nwas a scholar, you know, and taught me a great deal. That is the reason\r\nwhy I can teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lillo, rather hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he is old and blind in the\r\npicture. Did he get a great deal of glory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much, Lillo. The world was not always very kind to him, and he saw\r\nmeaner men than himself put into higher places, because they could\r\nflatter and say what was false. And then his dear son thought it right\r\nto leave him and become a monk; and after that, my father, being blind\r\nand lonely, felt unable to do the things that would have made his\r\nlearning of greater use to men, so that he might still have lived in\r\nhis works after he was in his grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not like that sort of life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lillo. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to be\r\nsomething that would make me a great man, and very happy\r\nbesides\xe2\x80\x94something that would not hinder me from having a good deal of\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not easy, my Lillo. It is only a poor sort of happiness that\r\ncould ever come by caring very much about our own narrow pleasures. We\r\ncan only have the highest happiness, such as goes along with being a\r\ngreat man, by having wide thoughts, and much feeling for the rest of\r\nthe world as well as ourselves; and this sort of happiness often brings\r\nso much pain with it, that we can only tell it from pain by its being\r\nwhat we would choose before everything else, because our souls see it\r\nis good. There are so many things wrong and difficult in the world,\r\nthat no man can be great\xe2\x80\x94he can hardly keep himself from\r\nwickedness\xe2\x80\x94unless he gives up thinking much about pleasure or rewards,\r\nand gets strength to endure what is hard and painful. My father had the\r\ngreatness that belongs to integrity; he chose poverty and obscurity\r\nrather than falsehood. And there was Fra Girolamo\xe2\x80\x94you know why I keep\r\nto-morrow sacred: _he_ had the greatness which belongs to a life spent\r\nin struggling against powerful wrong, and in trying to raise men to the\r\nhighest deeds they are capable of. And so, my Lillo, if you mean to act\r\nnobly and seek to know the best things God has put within reach of men,\r\nyou must learn to fix your mind on that end, and not on what will\r\nhappen to you because of it. And remember, if you were to choose\r\nsomething lower, and make it the rule of your life to seek your own\r\npleasure and escape from what is disagreeable, calamity might come just\r\nthe same; and it would be calamity falling on a base mind, which, is\r\nthe one form of sorrow that has no balm in it, and that may well make a\r\nman say, \xe2\x80\x98It would have been better for me if I had never been born.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nwill tell you something, Lillo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomola paused for a moment. She had taken Lillo\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks between her\r\nhands, and his young eyes were meeting hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a man to whom I was very near, so that I could see a great\r\ndeal of his life, who made almost every one fond of him, for he was\r\nyoung, and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all were gentle\r\nand kind. I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of\r\nanything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from\r\neverything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as\r\nhis own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nas make men infamous. He denied his father, and left him to misery; he\r\nbetrayed every trust that was reposed in him, that he might keep\r\nhimself safe and get rich and prosperous. Yet calamity overtook him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Romola paused. Her voice was unsteady, and Lillo was looking up\r\nat her with awed wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother time, my Lillo\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you another time. See, there are\r\nour old Piero di Cosimo and Nello coming up the Borgo Pinti, bringing\r\nus their flowers. Let us go and wave our hands to them, that they may\r\nknow we see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow queer old Piero is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lillo as they stood at the corner of the\r\nloggia, watching the advancing figures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe abuses you for dressing the\r\naltar, and thinking so much of Fra Girolamo, and yet he brings you the\r\nflowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romola. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are many good people who did not love\r\nFra Girolamo. Perhaps I should never have learned to love him if he had\r\nnot helped me when I was in great need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMOLA ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
