He returned to Norway in July 1891, for a stay of\r\nindefinite length; but the restless wanderer over Europe was destined\r\nto leave his home no more.... He had not returned, however, to throw\r\nhimself, as of old, into the battle of the passing day. Polemics are\r\nentirely absent from the poetry of his old age. He leaves the State and\r\nSociety at peace. He who had departed as the creator of Falk [in _Love\'s\r\nComedy_] now, on his return, gazes into the secret places of human\r\nnature and the wonder of his own soul."\r\n\r\nDr. Brahm, however, seems to be mistaken in thinking that Ibsen returned\r\nto Norway with no definite intention of settling down. Dr. Julius Elias\r\n(an excellent authority) reports that shortly before Ibsen left Munich\r\nin 1891, he remarked one day, "I must get back to the North!" "Is that\r\na sudden impulse?" asked Elias. "Oh no," was the reply; "I want to be\r\na good head of a household and have my affairs in order. To that end I\r\nmust consolidate may property, lay it down in good securities, and\r\nget it under control--and that one can best do where one has rights of\r\ncitizenship." Some critics will no doubt be shocked to find the poet\r\nwhom they have written down an "anarchist" confessing such bourgeois\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to Norway, Ibsen\'s correspondence became very scant,\r\nand we have no letters dating from the period when he was at work on\r\n_The Master Builder_. On the other hand, we possess a curious lyrical\r\nprelude to the play, which he put on paper on March 16, 1892. It is\r\nsaid to have been his habit, before setting to work on a play, to\r\n"crystallise in a poem the mood which then possessed him;" but the\r\nfollowing is the only one of these keynote poems which has been\r\npublished. I give it in the original language, with a literal\r\ntranslation:\r\n\r\n\r\nDE SAD DER, DE TO--\r\n\r\n     De sad der, de to, i saa lunt et hus\r\n     ved host og i venterdage,\r\n     Saa braendte huset.  Alt ligger i grus.\r\n     De to faar i asken rage.\r\n\r\n     For nede id en er et smykke gemt,--\r\n     et smykke, som aldrig kan braende.\r\n     Og leder de trofast, haender det nemt\r\n     at det findes af ham eller hende.\r\n\r\n     Men finder de end, brandlidte to,\r\n     det dyre, ildfaste smykke,--\r\n     aldrig han finder sin braendte tro,\r\n     han aldrig sin braendte lykke.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY SAT THERE, THE TWO--\r\n\r\n  They sat there, the two, in so cosy a house, through autumn\r\n  and winter days.  Then the house burned down.  Everything\r\n  lies in ruins.  The two must grope among the ashes.\r\n\r\n  For among them is hidden a jewel--a jewel that never can burn.\r\n  And if they search faithfully, it may easily happen that he\r\n  or she may find it.\r\n\r\n  But even should they find it, the burnt-out two--find this\r\n  precious unburnable jewel--never will she find her burnt faith,\r\n  he never his burnt happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the latest piece of Ibsen\'s verse that has been given to the\r\nworld; but one of his earliest poems--first printed in 1858--was also,\r\nin some sort, a prelude to _The Master Builder_. Of this a literal\r\ntranslation may suffice. It is called,\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING-PLANS\r\n\r\n  I remember as clearly as if it had been to-day the evening\r\n  when, in the paper, I saw my first poem in print.  There I\r\n  sat in my den, and, with long-drawn puffs, I smoked and I\r\n  dreamed in blissful self-complacency.\r\n\r\n  "I will build a cloud-castle.  It shall shine all over the\r\n  North.  It shall have two wings: one little and one great.\r\n  The great wing shall shelter a deathless poet; the little\r\n  wing shall serve as a young girl\'s bower."\r\n\r\n  The plan seemed to me nobly harmonious; but as time went on\r\n  it fell into confusion.  When the master grew reasonable, the\r\n  castle turned utterly crazy; the great wing became too little,\r\n  the little wing fell to ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we see that, thirty-five years before the date of _The Master\r\nBuilder_, Ibsen\'s imagination was preoccupied with a symbol of a master\r\nbuilding a castle in the air, and a young girl in one of its towers.\r\n\r\nThere has been some competition among the poet\'s young lady friends for\r\nthe honour of having served as his model for Hilda. Several, no doubt,\r\nare entitled to some share in it. One is not surprised to learn that\r\namong the papers he left behind were sheaves upon sheaves of letters\r\nfrom women. "All these ladies," says Dr. Julius Elias, "demanded\r\nsomething of him--some cure for their agonies of soul, or for the\r\nincomprehension from which they suffered; some solution of the riddle of\r\ntheir nature. Almost every one of them regarded herself as a problem\r\nto which Ibsen could not but have the time and the interest to apply\r\nhimself. They all thought they had a claim on the creator of Nora....\r\nOf this chapter of his experience, Fru Ibsen spoke with ironic\r\nhumour. \'Ibsen (I have often said to him), Ibsen, keep these swarms of\r\nover-strained womenfolk at arm\'s length.\' \'Oh no (he would reply), let\r\nthem alone. I want to observe them more closely.\' His observations would\r\ntake a longer or shorter time as the case might be, and would always\r\ncontribute to some work of art."\r\n\r\nThe principal model for Hilda was doubtless Fraulein Emilie Bardach,\r\nof Vienna, whom he met at Gossensass in the autumn of 1889. He was then\r\nsixty-one years of age; she is said to have been seventeen. As the lady\r\nherself handed his letters to Dr. Brandes for publication, there can be\r\nno indiscretion in speaking of them freely. Some passages from them I\r\nhave quoted in the introduction to _Hedda Gabler_--passages which show\r\nthat at first the poet deliberately put aside his Gossensass impressions\r\nfor use when he should stand at a greater distance from them, and\r\nmeanwhile devoted himself to work in a totally different key. On October\r\n15, 1889, he writes, in his second letter to Fraulein Bardach: "I\r\ncannot repress my summer memories, nor do I want to. I live through my\r\nexperiences again and again. To transmute it all into a poem I find, in\r\nthe meantime, impossible. In the meantime? Shall I succeed in doing\r\nso some time in the future? And do I really wish to succeed? In the\r\nmeantime, at any rate, I do not.... And yet it must come in time." The\r\nletters number twelve in all, and are couched in a tone of sentimental\r\nregret for the brief, bright summer days of their acquaintanceship. The\r\nkeynote is struck in the inscription on the back of a photograph\r\nwhich he gave her before they parted: _An die Maisonne eines\r\nSeptemberlebens--in Tirol_,(1) 27/9/89. In her album he had written the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Hohes, schmerzliches Gluck--\r\n     um das Unerreichbare zu ringen!(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nin which we may, if we like, see a foreshadowing of the Solness frame\r\nof mind. In the fifth letter of the series he refers to her as "an\r\nenigmatic Princess"; in the sixth he twice calls her "my dear Princess";\r\nbut this is the only point at which the letters quite definitely and\r\nunmistakably point forward to _The Master Builder_. In the ninth letter\r\n(February 6, 1890) he says: "I feel it a matter of conscience to end,\r\nor at any rate, to restrict, our correspondence." The tenth letter,\r\nsix months later, is one of kindly condolence on the death of the young\r\nlady\'s father. In the eleventh (very short) note, dated December 30,\r\n1890, he acknowledges some small gift, but says: "Please, for the\r\npresent, do not write me again.... I will soon send you my new play\r\n[_Hedda Gabler_]. Receive it in friendship, but in silence!" This\r\ninjunction she apparently obeyed. When _The Master Builder_ appeared, it\r\nwould seem that Ibsen did not even send her a copy of the play; and we\r\ngather that he was rather annoyed when she sent him a photograph\r\nsigned "Princess of Orangia." On his seventieth birthday, however, she\r\ntelegraphed her congratulations, to which he returned a very cordial\r\nreply. And here their relations ended.\r\n\r\nThat she was right, however, in regarding herself as his principal model\r\nfor Hilda appears from an anecdote related by Dr. Elias.(3) It is not\r\nan altogether pleasing anecdote, but Dr. Elias is an unexceptionable\r\nwitness, and it can by no means be omitted from an examination into the\r\norigins of _The Master Builder_. Ibsen had come to Berlin in February\r\n1891 for the first performance of _Hedda Gabler_. Such experiences were\r\nalways a trial to him, and he felt greatly relieved when they were over.\r\nPacking, too, he detested; and Elias having helped him through this\r\nterrible ordeal, the two sat down to lunch together, while awaiting the\r\ntrain. An expansive mood descended upon Ibsen, and chuckling over his\r\nchampagne glass, he said: "Do you know, my next play is already hovering\r\nbefore me--of course in vague outline. But of one thing I have got\r\nfirm hold. An experience: a woman\'s figure. Very interesting, very\r\ninteresting indeed. Again a spice of the devilry in it." Then he\r\nrelated how he had met in the Tyrol a Viennese girl of very remarkable\r\ncharacter. She had at once made him her confidant. The gist of her\r\nconfessions was that she did not care a bit about one day marrying\r\na well brought-up young man--most likely she would never marry. What\r\ntempted and charmed and delighted her was to lure other women\'s husbands\r\naway from them. She was a little daemonic wrecker; she often appeared to\r\nhim like a little bird of prey, that would fain have made him, too, her\r\nbooty. He had studied her very, very closely. For the rest, she had had\r\nno great success with him. "She did not get hold of me, but I got\r\nhold of her--for my play. Then I fancy" (here he chuckled again) "she\r\nconsoled herself with some one else." Love seemed to mean for her only\r\na sort of morbid imagination. This, however, was only one side of her\r\nnature. His little model had had a great deal of heart and of womanly\r\nunderstanding; and thanks to the spontaneous power she could gain over\r\nhim, every woman might, if she wished it, guide some man towards the\r\ngood. "Thus Ibsen spoke," says Elias, "calmly and coolly, gazing as it\r\nwere into the far distance, like an artist taking an objective view of\r\nsome experience--like Lubek speaking of his soul-thefts. He had stolen\r\na soul, and put it to a double employment. Thea Elvsted and Hilda Wangel\r\nare intimately related--are, indeed only different expressions of the\r\nsame nature." If Ibsen actually declared Thea and Hilda to be drawn from\r\none model, we must of course take his word for it; but the relationship\r\nis hard to discern.\r\n\r\nThere can be no reasonable doubt, then, that the Gossensass episode gave\r\nthe primary impulse to _The Master Builder_. But it seems pretty well\r\nestablished, too, that another lady, whom he met in Christiania after\r\nhis return in 1891, also contributed largely to the character of\r\nHilda. This may have been the reason why he resented Fraulein Bardach\'s\r\nappropriating to herself the title of "Princess of Orangia."\r\n\r\nThe play was published in the middle of December 1892. It was acted both\r\nin Germany and England before it was seen in the Scandinavian capitals.\r\nIts first performance took place at the Lessing Theatre, Berlin, January\r\n19, 1893, with Emanuel Reicher as Solness and Frl. Reisenhofer as Hilda.\r\nIn London it was first performed at the Trafalgar Square Theatre (now\r\nthe Duke of York\'s) on February 20, 1893, under the direction of Mr.\r\nHerbert Waring and Miss Elizabeth Robins, who played Solness and Hilda.\r\nThis was one of the most brilliant and successful of English Ibsen\r\nproductions. Miss Robins was almost an ideal Hilda, and Mr. Waring\'s\r\nSolness was exceedingly able. Some thirty performances were give in all,\r\nand the play was reproduced at the Opera Comique later in the season,\r\nwith Mr. Lewis Waller as Solness. In the following year Miss Robins\r\nacted Hilda in Manchester. In Christiania and Copenhagen the play was\r\nproduced on the same evening, March 8, 1893; the Copenhagen Solness\r\nand Hilda were Emil Poulsen and Fru Hennings. A Swedish production,\r\nby Lindberg, soon followed, both in Stockholm and Gothenburg. In Paris\r\n_Solness le constructeur_ was not seen until April 3, 1894, when it\r\nwas produced by "L\'OEuvre" with M. Lugne-Poe as Solness. The company,\r\nsometimes with Mme. Suzanne Despres and sometimes with Mme. Berthe\r\nBady as Hilda, in 1894 and 1895 presented the play in London, Brussels,\r\nAmsterdam, Milan, and other cities. In October 1894 they visited\r\nChristiania, where Ibsen was present at one of their performances, and\r\nis reported by Herman Bang to have been so enraptured with it that he\r\nexclaimed, "This is the resurrection of my play!" On this occasion Mme.\r\nBady was the Hilda. The first performance of the play in America took\r\nplace at the Carnegie Lyceum, New York, on January 16, 1900, with\r\nMr. William H. Pascoe as Solness and Miss Florence Kahn as Hilda.\r\nThe performance was repeated in the course of the same month, both at\r\nWashington and Boston.\r\n\r\nIn England, and probably elsewhere as well, _The Master Builder_\r\nproduced a curious double effect. It alienated many of the poet\'s\r\nstaunchest admirers, and it powerfully attracted many people who had\r\nhitherto been hostile to him. Looking back, it is easy to see why this\r\nshould have been so; for here was certainly a new thing in drama, which\r\ncould not but set up many novel reactions. A greater contrast could\r\nscarcely be imagined than that between the hard, cold, precise outlines\r\nof _Hedda Gabler_ and the vague mysterious atmosphere of _The Master\r\nBuilder_, in which, though the dialogue is sternly restrained within\r\nthe limits of prose, the art of drama seems for ever on the point of\r\nfloating away to blend with the art of music. Substantially, the play\r\nis one long dialogue between Solness and Hilda; and it would be quite\r\npossible to analyse this dialogue in terms of music, noting (for\r\nexample) the announcement first of this theme and then of that, the\r\nresumption and reinforcement of a theme which seemed to have been\r\ndropped, the contrapuntal interweaving of two or more motives, a scherzo\r\nhere, a fugal passage there. Leaving this exercise to some one more\r\nskilled in music (or less unskilled) than myself, I may note that in\r\n_The Master Builder_ Ibsen resumes his favourite retrospective method,\r\nfrom which in _Hedda Gabler_ he had in great measure departed. But the\r\nretrospect with which we are here concerned is purely psychological. The\r\nexternal events involved in it are few and simple in comparison with\r\nthe external events which are successively unveiled in retrospective\r\npassages of _The Wild Duck_ or _Rosmersholm_. The matter of the play\r\nis the soul-history of Halvard Solness, recounted to an impassioned\r\nlistener--so impassioned, indeed, that the soul-changes it begets in her\r\nform an absorbing and thrilling drama. The graduations, retardations,\r\naccelerations of Solness\'s self-revealment are managed with the subtlest\r\nart, so as to keep the interest of the spectator ever on the stretch.\r\nThe technical method was not new; it was simply that which Ibsen had\r\nbeen perfecting from _Pillars of Society_ onward; but it was applied to\r\na subject of a nature not only new to him, but new to literature.\r\n\r\nThat the play is full of symbolism it would be futile to deny; and the\r\nsymbolism is mainly autobiographic. The churches which Solness sets out\r\nbuilding doubtless represent Ibsen\'s early romantic plays, the "homes\r\nfor human beings" his social drama; while the houses with high towers,\r\nmerging into "castles in the air," stand for those spiritual dramas,\r\nwith a wide outlook over the metaphysical environment of humanity, on\r\nwhich he was henceforth to be engaged. Perhaps it is not altogether\r\nfanciful to read a personal reference into Solness\'s refusal to call\r\nhimself an architect, on the ground that his training has not been\r\nsystematic--that he is a self-taught man. Ibsen too was in all\r\nessentials self-taught; his philosophy was entirely unsystematic; and,\r\nlike Solness, he was no student of books. There may be an introspective\r\nnote also in that dread of the younger generation to which Solness\r\nconfesses. It is certain that the old Master-Builder was not lavish\r\nof his certificates of competence to young aspirants, though there is\r\nnothing to show that his reticence ever depressed or quenched any rising\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it cannot be doubted that several symbolic motives\r\nare inwoven into the iridescent fabric of the play. But it is a\r\ngreat mistake to regard it as essentially and inseparably a piece of\r\nsymbolism. Essentially it is a history of a sickly conscience, worked\r\nout in terms of pure psychology. Or rather, it is a study of a\r\nsickly and a robust conscience side by side. "The conscience is very\r\nconservative," Ibsen has somewhere said; and here Solness\'s conservatism\r\nis contrasted with Hilda\'s radicalism--or rather would-be radicalism,\r\nfor we are led to suspect, towards the close, that the radical too is a\r\nconservative in spite or herself. The fact that Solness cannot climb as\r\nhigh as he builds implies, I take it, that he cannot act as freely as\r\nhe thinks, or as Hilda would goad him into thinking. At such an altitude\r\nhis conscience would turn dizzy, and life would become impossible to\r\nhim. But here I am straying back to the interpretation of symbols. My\r\npresent purpose is to insist that there is nothing in the play which has\r\nno meaning on the natural-psychological plane, and absolutely requires\r\na symbolic interpretation to make it comprehensible. The symbols are\r\nharmonic undertones; the psychological melody is clear and consistent\r\nwithout any reference to them.(4) It is true that, in order to accept\r\nthe action on what we may call the realistic level, we must suppose\r\nSolness to possess and to exercise, sometimes unconsciously, a\r\nconsiderable measure of hypnotic power. But time is surely past when\r\nwe could reckon hypnotism among "supernatural" phenomena. Whether the\r\nparticular forms of hypnotic influence attributed to Solness do actually\r\nexist is a question we need not determine. The poet does not demand our\r\nabsolute credence, as though he were giving evidence in the witness-box.\r\nWhat he requires is our imaginative acceptance of certain incidents\r\nwhich he purposely leaves hovering on the border between the natural and\r\nthe preternatural, the explained and the unexplained. In this play, as\r\nin _The Lady from the Sea_ and _Little Eyolf_, he shows a delicacy of\r\nart in his dalliance with the occult which irresistibly recalls the\r\nexquisite genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne.(5)\r\n\r\nThe critics who insist on finding nothing but symbolism in the play have\r\nfastened on Mrs. Solness\'s "nine lovely dolls," and provided the most\r\namazing interpretations for them. A letter which I contributed in 1893\r\nto the _Westminster Gazette_ records an incident which throws a curious\r\nlight on the subject and may be worth preserving. "At a recent first\r\nnight," I wrote, "I happened to be seated just behind a well-known\r\ncritic. He turned round to me and said, \'I want you to tell me what is\r\nYOUR theory of those "nine lovely dolls." Of course one can see that\r\nthey are entirely symbolical.\' \'I am not so sure of that,\' I replied,\r\nremembering a Norwegian cousin of my own who treasured a favourite doll\r\nuntil she was nearer thirty than twenty. \'They of course symbolise the\r\nunsatisfied passion of motherhood in Mrs. Solness\'s heart, but I have\r\nvery little doubt that Ibsen makes use of this "symbol" because he has\r\nobserved a similar case, or cases, in real life.\' \'What!\' cried the\r\ncritic. \'He has seen a grown-up, a middle-aged woman continuing to "live\r\nwith" her dolls!\' I was about to say that it did not seem to me so very\r\nimprobable, when a lady who was seated next me, a total stranger to both\r\nof us, leant forward and said, \'Excuse my interrupting you, but it\r\nmay perhaps interest you to know that I HAVE THREE DOLLS TO WHICH I AM\r\nDEEPLY ATTACHED!\' I will not be so rude as to conjecture this lady\'s\r\nage, but we may be sure that a very young woman would not have had the\r\ncourage to make such an avowal. Does it not seem that Ibsen knows a\r\nthing or two about human nature--English as well as Norwegian--which\r\nwe dramatic critics, though bound by our calling to be subtle\r\npsychologists, have not yet fathomed?" In the course of the\r\ncorrespondence which followed, one very apposite anecdote was quoted\r\nfrom an American paper, the _Argonaut_: "An old Virginia lady said to\r\na friend, on finding a treasured old cup cracked by a careless maid,\r\n\'I know of nothing to compare with the affliction of losing a handsome\r\npiece of old china.\' \'Surely,\' said the friend, \'it is not so bad as\r\nlosing one\'s children.\' \'Yes, it is,\' replied the old lady, \'for when\r\nyour children die, you do have the consolations of religion, you know.\'"\r\n\r\nIt would be a paradox to call _The Master Builder_ Ibsen\'s greatest\r\nwork, but one of his three or four greatest it assuredly is. Of all his\r\nwritings, it is probably the most original, the most individual, the\r\nmost unlike any other drama by any other writer. The form of _Brand_ and\r\n_Peer Gynt_ was doubtless suggested by other dramatic poems--notably by\r\n_Faust_. In _The Wild Duck_, in _Rosmersholm_, in _Hedda Gabler_, even\r\nin _Little Eyolf_ and _John Gabriel Borkman_, there remain faint traces\r\nof the French leaven which is so strong in the earlier plays. But _The\r\nMaster Builder_ had no model and has no parallel. It shows no slightest\r\nvestige of outside influence. It is Ibsen, and nothing but Ibsen.\r\n\r\nW.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*FOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n (1)"To the May-sun of a September life--in Tyrol."\r\n\r\n (2)"High, painful happiness--to struggle for the unattainable!"\r\n\r\n (3)_Neus deutsche Rundschau_, December, 1906, p.1462.\r\n\r\n (4)This conception I have worked out at much greater length in an\r\n   essay entitled _The Melody of the Master Builder_, appended to\r\n   the shilling edition of the play, published in 1893.  I there\r\n   retell the story, transplanting it to England and making the hero\r\n   a journalist instead of an architect, in order to show that (if\r\n   we grant the reality of certain commonly-accepted phenomena of\r\n   hypnotism) there is nothing incredible or even extravagantly\r\n   improbable about it.

Try to get a\r\nlittle sleep--\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nThen take a little walk.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nYes, do. I will come with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have\r\nit out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with\r\nhim--with the chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nYes, better wait, father!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha--ha--! _I_ haven\'t much time for\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.\r\n\r\n     [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no\r\n  longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly\r\n  hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a\r\n  greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and\r\n  broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,\r\n  and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen\'s office, and asks in a\r\nwhisper:] Are they gone?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Softly, shaking her] No.\r\n\r\n     [She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,\r\n       throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table\r\n       by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on\r\n       writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Starts.] Oh, it is only something that--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nLet me look at it, Miss Fosli. [Bends over her, pretends to be looking\r\ninto the ledger, and whispers:] Kaia!\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Softly, still writing.] Well?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy do you always take that shade off when I come?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[As before.] I look so ugly with it on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Smiling.] Then you don\'t like to look ugly, Kaia?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia--\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Bending her head.] Hush--they can hear you!\r\n\r\n     [SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses\r\n       at the door of the draughtsmen\'s office.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHas any one been here for me?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Rising.] Yes, the young couple who want a villa built, out at\r\nLovstrand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Growling.] Oh, those two! They must wait. I am not quite clear about\r\nthe plans yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Advancing, with some hesitation.] They were very anxious to have the\r\ndrawings at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[As before.] Yes, of course--so they all are.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Looks up.] They say they are longing so to get into a house of their\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, yes--we know all that! And so they are content to take whatever\r\nis offered them. They get a--a roof over their heads--an address--but\r\nnothing to call a home. No thank you! In that case, let them apply to\r\nsomebody else. Tell them that, the next time they call.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Pushes his glasses up on to his forehead and looks in astonishment at\r\nhim.] To somebody else? Are you prepared to give up the commission?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Impatiently.] Yes, yes, yes, devil take it! If that is to be the way of\r\nit--. Rather that, than build away at random. [Vehemently.] Besides, I\r\nknow very little about these people as yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nThe people are safe enough. Ragnar knows them. He is a friend of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, safe--safe enough! That is not at all what I mean. Good lord--don\'t\r\nyou understand me either? [Angrily.] I won\'t have anything to do with\r\nthese strangers. They may apply to whom they please, so far as I am\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Rising.] Do you really mean that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Sulkily.] Yes I do.--For once in a way. [He comes forward.\r\n\r\n     [BROVIK exchanges a glance with RAGNAR, who makes a warning\r\n       gesture.  Then BROVIK comes into the front room.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nMay I have a few words with you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nCertainly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[To KAIA.] Just go in there for moment, Kaia.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Uneasily.] Oh, but uncle--\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nDo as I say, child. And shut the door after you.\r\n\r\n     [KAIA goes reluctantly into the draughtsmen\'s office, glances\r\n       anxiously and imploringly at SOLNESS, and shuts the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Lowering his voice a little.] I don\'t want the poor children to know\r\nhow I am.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, you have been looking very poorly of late.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nIt will soon be all over with me. My strength is ebbing--from day to\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWon\'t you sit down?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nThanks--may I?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Placing the arm-chair more conveniently.] Here--take this chair.--And\r\nnow?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Has seated himself with difficulty.] Well, you see, it\'s about Ragnar.\r\nThat is what weighs most upon me. What is to become of him?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOf course your son will stay with me as long as ever he likes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nBut that is just what he does not like. He feels that he cannot stay\r\nhere any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy, I should say he was very well off here. But if he wants more money,\r\nI should not mind--\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nNo, no! It is not that. [Impatiently.] But sooner or later he, too, must\r\nhave a chance of doing something on his own account.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Without looking at him.] Do you think that Ragnar has quite talent\r\nenough to stand alone?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nNo, that is just the heartbreaking part of it--I have begun to have\r\nmy doubts about the boy. For you have never said so much as--as one\r\nencouraging word about him. And yet I cannot but think there must be\r\nsomething in him--he can\'t be without talent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, but he has learnt nothing--nothing thoroughly, I mean. Except, of\r\ncourse, to draw.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him with covert hatred, and says hoarsely.] You had learned\r\nlittle enough of the business when you were in my employment. But\r\nthat did not prevent you from setting to work--[breathing with\r\ndifficulty]--and pushing your way up, and taking the wind out of my\r\nsails--mine, and so may other people\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, you see--circumstances favoured me.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nYou are right there. Everything favoured you. But then how can you have\r\nthe heart to let me go to my grave--without having seen what Ragnar is\r\nfit for? And of course I am anxious to see them married, too--before I\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Sharply.] Is it she who wishes it?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nNot Kaia so much as Ragnar--he talks about it every day. [Appealingly.]\r\nYou must help him to get some independent work now! I must see something\r\nthat the lad has done. Do you hear?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Peevishly.] Hang it, man, you can\'t expect me to drag commissions down\r\nfrom the moon for him!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nHe has the chance of a capital commission at this very moment. A big bit\r\nof work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Uneasily, startled.] Has he?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nI you would give your consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of work do you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[With some hesitation.] He can have the building of that villa out at\r\nLovstrand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat! Why I am going to build that myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nOh you don\'t much care about doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Flaring up.] Don\'t care! Who dares to say that?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nYou said so yourself just now.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, never mind what I say.--Would they give Ragnar the building of that\r\nvilla?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nYes. You see, he knows the family. And then--just for the fun of the\r\nthing--he has made drawings and estimates and so forth--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAre they pleased with the drawings? The people who will have to live in\r\nthe house?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nYes. If you would only look through them and approve of them--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen they would let Ragnar build their home for them?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nThey were immensely pleased with his idea. They thought it exceedingly\r\noriginal, they said.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOho! Original! Not the old-fashioned stuff that _I_ am in the habit of\r\nturning out!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to them different.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With suppressed irritation.] So it was to see Ragnar that they came\r\nhere--whilst I was out!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nThey came to call upon you--and at the same time to ask whether you\r\nwould mind retiring--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Angrily.] Retire? I?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nIn case you thought that Ragnar\'s drawings--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI! Retire in favour of your son!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nRetire from the agreement, they meant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, it comes to the same thing. [Laughs angrily.] So that is it, is it?\r\nHalvard Solness is to see about retiring now! To make room for younger\r\nmen! For the very youngest, perhaps! He must make room! Room! Room!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nWhy, good heavens! there is surely room for more than one single man--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, there\'s not so very much room to spare either. But, be that as it\r\nmay--I will never retire! I will never give way to anybody! Never of my\r\nown free will. Never in this world will I do that!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Rise with difficulty.] Then I am to pass out of life without any\r\ncertainty? Without a gleam of happiness? Without any faith or trust in\r\nRagnar? Without having seen a single piece of work of his doing? Is that\r\nto be the way of it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Turns half aside, and mutters.] H\'m--don\'t ask more just now.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nI must have an answer to this one question. Am I to pass out of life in\r\nsuch utter poverty?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Seems to struggle with himself; finally he says, in a low but firm\r\nvoice:] You must pass out of life as best you can.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nThen be it so. [He goes up the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Following him, half is desperation.] Don\'t you understand that I cannot\r\nhelp it? I am what I am, and I cannot change my nature!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nNo; I suppose that you can\'t. [Reels and supports himself against the\r\nsofa-table.] May I have a glass of water?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBy all means. [Fills a glass and hands it to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nThanks. [Drinks and puts the glass down again.\r\n\r\n     [SOLNESS goes up and opens the door of the draughtsmen\'s office.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nRagnar--you must come and take your father home.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ragnar rises quickly.  He and KAIA come into the work-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nWhat is the matter, father?\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\nGive me your arm. Now let us go.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nVery well. You had better put your things on, too, Kaia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosli must stay--just for a moment. There is a letter I want\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROVIK.\r\n\r\n[Looks at SOLNESS.] Good night. Sleep well--if you can.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nGood night.\r\n\r\n     [BROVIK and RAGNAR go out by the hall-door.  KAIA goes to the\r\n       desk.  SOLNESS stands with bent head, to the right, by the\r\n       arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Dubiously.] Is there any letter?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Curtly.] No, of course not. [Looks sternly at her.] Kaia!\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Anxiously, in a low voice.] Yes!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Points imperatively to a spot on the floor.] Come here! At once!\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Hesitatingly.] Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[As before.] Nearer!\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Obeying.] What do you want with me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at her for a while.] Is it you I have to thank for all this?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nNo, no, don\'t think that!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut confess now--you want to get married!\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Softly.] Ragnar and I have been engaged for four or five years, and\r\nso--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd so you think it time there were an end of it. Is not that so?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nRagnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[More gently.] Kaia, don\'t you really care a little bit for Ragnar, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nI cared very much for Ragnar once--before I came here to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut you don\'t now? Not in the least?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Passionately, clasping hands and holding them out towards him.] Oh, you\r\nknow very well there is only one person I care for now! I shall never\r\ncare for any one else.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, you say that. And yet you go away from me--leave me alone here with\r\neverything on my hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nBut could I not stay with you, even if Ragnar--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Repudiating the idea.] No, no, that is quite impossible. If Ragnar\r\nleaves me and starts work on his own account, then of course he will\r\nneed you himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Wringing her hands.] Oh, I feel as if I could not be separated from\r\nyou! It\'s quite, quite impossible!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen be sure you get those foolish notions out of Ragnar\'s head. Marry\r\nhim as much as you please--[Alters his tone.] I mean--don\'t let him\r\nthrow up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you too, my\r\ndear Kaia.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nOh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Clasps her head with his two hands and whispers.] For I cannot get on\r\nwithout you, you see. I must have you with me every single day.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[In nervous exaltation.] My God! My God!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Kisses her hair.] Kaia--Kaia!\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Sinks down before him.] Oh, how good you are to me! How unspeakably\r\ngood you are!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Vehemently.] Get up! For goodness\' sake get up! I think I hear some\r\none.\r\n\r\n     [He helps her to rise.  She staggers over to the desk.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MRS. SOLNESS enters by the door on the right.  She looks thin\r\n  and wasted with grief, but shows traces of bygone beauty.\r\n  Blonde ringlets.  Dressed with good taste, wholly in black.\r\n  Speaks some-what slowly and in a plaintive voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In the doorway.] Halvard!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Turns.] Oh, are you there, my dear--?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a glance at KAIA.] I am afraid I am disturbing you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNot in the least. Miss Fosli has only a short letter to write.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, so I see.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat do you want with me, Aline?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI merely wanted to tell you that Dr. Herdal is in the drawing-room.\r\nWon\'t you come and see him, Halvard?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks suspiciously at her.]. H\'m--is the doctor so very anxious to see\r\nme?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, not exactly anxious. He really came to see me; but he would like\r\nto say how-do-you-do to you at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Laughs to himself.] Yes, I daresay. Well, you must ask him to wait a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen you will come in presently?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I will. Presently, presently, dear. In a little while.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Glancing again at KAIA.] Well now, don\'t forget, Halvard.\r\n\r\n     [Withdraws and closes the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Softly.] Oh dear, oh dear--I am sure Mrs. Solness thinks ill of me in\r\nsome way!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, not in the least. Not more than usual at any rate. But all the same,\r\nyou had better go now, Kaia.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, now I must go.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Severely.] And mind you get that matter settled for me. Do you hear?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nOh, if it only depended on me--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI will have it settled, I say! And to-morrow too--not a day later!\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Terrified.] If there\'s nothing else for it, I am quite willing to break\r\noff the engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Angrily.] Break it off. Are you mad? Would you think of breaking it\r\noff?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Distracted.] Yes, if necessary. For I must--I must stay here with you!\r\nI can\'t leave you! That is utterly--utterly impossible!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a sudden outburst.] But deuce take it--how about Ragnar then! It\'s\r\nRagnar that I--\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him with terrified eyes.] It is chiefly on Ragnar\'s account,\r\nthat--that you--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Collecting himself.] No, no, of course not! You don\'t understand me\r\neither. [Gently and softly.] Of course it is you I want to keep.--you\r\nabove everything, Kaia. But for that very reason, you must prevent\r\nRagnar, too, from throwing up his situation. There, there,--now go home.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nYes, yes--good-night, then.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nGood night. [As she is going.] Oh, stop a moment! Are Ragnar\'s drawings\r\nin there?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nI did not see him take them with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen just go and find them for me. I might perhaps glance over them,\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Happy.] Oh yes, please do!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFor your sake, Kaia dear. Now, let me have them at once, please.\r\n\r\n     [KAIA hurries into the draughtsmen\'s office, searches anxiously\r\n       in the table-drawer, finds a portfolio and brings it with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nHere are all the drawings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nGood. Put them down there on the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Putting down the portfolio.] Good night, then. [Beseechingly.] And\r\nplease, please think kindly of me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, that I always do. Good-night, my dear little Kaia. [Glances to the\r\nright.] Go, go now!\r\n\r\n\r\n  MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL enter by the door on the right.\r\n  He is a stoutish, elderly man, with a round, good-humoured\r\n  face, clean shaven, with thin, light hair, and gold spectacles.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Still in the doorway.] Halvard, I cannot keep the doctor any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell then, come in here.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[To KAIA, who is turning down the desk-lamp.] Have you finished the\r\nletter already, Miss Fosli?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[In confusion.] The letter--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, it was quite a short one.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt must have been very short.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou may go now, Miss Fosli. And please come in good time to-morrow\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nI will be sure to. Good-night, Mrs. Solness.\r\n\r\n     [She goes out by the hall door.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAre you in a hurry, doctor?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNo, not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nMay I have a little chat with you?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen let us sit down. [He motions the doctor to take the rocking-chair,\r\nand sits down himself in the arm-chair. Looks searchingly at him.] Tell\r\nme--did you notice anything odd about Aline?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nDo you mean just now, when she was here?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, in her manner to me. Did you notice anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Smiling.] Well, I admit--one couldn\'t well avoid noticing that your\r\nwife--h\'m--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL. --that your wife is not particularly fond of this Miss\r\nFosli.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIs that all? I have noticed that myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAnd I must say I am scarcely surprised at it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAt what?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThat she should not exactly approve of your seeing so much of another\r\nwoman, all day and every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, no, I suppose you are right there--and Aline too. But it\'s\r\nimpossible to make any change.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nCould you not engage a clerk?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe first man that came to hand? No, thank you--that would never do for\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nBut now, if your wife--? Suppose, with her delicate health, all this\r\ntries her too much?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nEven then--I might almost say--it can make no difference. I must keep\r\nKaia Fosli. No one else could fill her place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNo one else?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Curtly.] No, no one.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Drawing his chair closer.] Now listen to me, my dear Mr. Solness. May I\r\nask you a question, quite between ourselves?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBy all means.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWomen, you see--in certain matters, they have a deucedly keen\r\nintuition--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThey have, indeed. There is not the least doubt of that. But--?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWell, tell me now--if your wife can\'t endure this Kaia Fosli--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, what then?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL. --may she not have just--just the least little bit of reason\r\nfor this instinctive dislike?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him and rises.] Oho!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNow don\'t be offended--but hasn\'t she?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With curt decision.] No.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNo reason of any sort?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo other than her own suspicious nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nI know you have known a good many women in your time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I have.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAnd have been a good deal taken with some of them, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, I don\'t deny it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nBut as regards Miss Fosli, then? There is nothing of that sort in this\r\ncase?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo; nothing at all--on my side.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nBut on her side?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI don\'t think you have any right to ask that question, doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWell, you know, we were discussing your wife\'s intuition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSo we were. And for that matter--[lowers his voice]--Aline\'s intuition,\r\nas you call it--in a certain sense, it has not been so far astray.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAha! there we have it!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Sits down.] Doctor Herdal--I am going to tell you a strange story--if\r\nyou care to listen to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nI like listening to strange stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nVery well then. I daresay you recollect that I took Knut Brovik and his\r\nson into my employment--after the old man\'s business had gone to the\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nYes, so I have understood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou see, they really are clever fellows, these two. Each of them has\r\ntalent in his own way. But then the son took it into his head to get\r\nengaged; and the next thing, of course, was that he wanted to get\r\nmarried--and begin to build on his own account. That is the way with all\r\nthese young people.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Laughing.] Yes, they have a bad habit of wanting to marry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nJust so. But of course that did not suit my plans; for I needed Ragnar\r\nmyself--and the old man too. He is exceedingly good at calculating\r\nbearing strains and cubic contents--and all that sort of devilry, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nOh yes, no doubt that\'s indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, it is. But Ragnar was absolutely bent on setting to work for\r\nhimself. He would hear of nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nBut he has stayed with you all the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I\'ll tell you how that came about. One day this girl, Kaia Fosli,\r\ncame to see them on some errand or other. She had never been here\r\nbefore. And when I saw how utterly infatuated they were with each other,\r\nthe thought occurred to me: if I cold only get her into the office here,\r\nthen perhaps Ragnar too would stay where he is.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThat was not at all a bad idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, but at the time I did not breathe a word of what was in my mind.\r\nI merely stood and looked at her--and kept on wishing intently that\r\nI could have her here. Then I talked to her a little, in a friendly\r\nway--about one thing and another. And then she went away.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWell?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell then, next day, pretty late in the evening, when old Brovik and\r\nRagnar had gone home, she came here again, and behaved as if I had made\r\nan arrangement with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement? What about?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAbout the very thing my mind had been fixed on. But I hadn\'t said one\r\nsingle word about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThat was most extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, was it not? And now she wanted to know what she was to do\r\nhere--whether she could begin the very next morning, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nDon\'t you think she did it in order to be with her sweetheart?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat was what occurred to me at first. But no, that was not it. She\r\nseemed to drift quite away from him--when once she had come here to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nShe drifted over to you, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, entirely. If I happen to look at her when her back is turned, I can\r\ntell that she feels it. She quivers and trembles the moment I come near\r\nher. What do you think of that?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nH\'m--that\'s not very hard to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, but what about the other thing? That she believed I had said to\r\nher what I had only wished and willed--silently--inwardly--to myself?\r\nWhat do you say to that? Can you explain that, Dr. Herdal?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNo, I won\'t undertake to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI felt sure you would not; and so I have never cared to talk about\r\nit till now.--But it\'s a cursed nuisance to me in the long run, you\r\nunderstand. Here have I got to go on day after day, pretending--. And\r\nit\'s a shame to treat her so, too, poor girl. [Vehemently.] But I cannot\r\ndo anything else. For if she runs away from me--then Ragnar will be off\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAnd you have not told your wife the rights of the story?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThe why on earth don\'t you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks fixedly at him, and says in a low voice:] Because I seem to\r\nfind a sort of--of salutary self-torture in allowing Aline to do me an\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Shakes his head.] I don\'t in the least understand what you mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, you see--it is like paying off a little bit of a huge,\r\nimmeasurable debt--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nTo your wife?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes; and that always helps to relieve one\'s mind a little. One can\r\nbreathe more freely for a while, you understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNo, goodness knows, I don\'t understand at all--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Breaking off, rises again.] Well, well, well--then we won\'t talk any\r\nmore about it. [He saunters across the room, returns, and stops beside\r\nthe table. Looks at the doctor with a sly smile.] I suppose you think\r\nyou have drawn me out nicely now, doctor?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[With some irritation.] Drawn you out? Again I have not the faintest\r\nnotion of what you mean, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh come, out with it; I have seen it quite clearly, you know.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWhat have you seen?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In a low voice, slowly.] That you have been quietly keeping an eye upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThat _I_ have! And why in all the world should I do that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBecause you think that I----  [Passionately.]  Well devil take it--you\r\nthink the same of me as Aline does.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAnd what does she think about you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Having recovered his self-control.] She has begun to think that I\r\nam--that I am--ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nIll! You! She has never hinted such a thing to me. Why, what can she\r\nthink is the matter with you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Leans over the back of the chair and whispers.] Aline has made up her\r\nmind that I am mad. That is what she thinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Rising.] Why, my dear fellow--!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, on my soul she does! I tell you it is so. And she has got you to\r\nthink the same! Oh, I can assure you, doctor, I see it in your face as\r\nclearly as possible. You don\'t take me in so easily, I can tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him in amazement.] Never, Mr. Solness--never has such a\r\nthought entered my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With and incredulous smile.] Really? Has it not?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNo, never! Nor your wife\'s mind either, I am convinced. I could almost\r\nswear to that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, I wouldn\'t advise you to. For, in a certain sense, you see,\r\nperhaps--perhaps she is not so far wrong in thinking something of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nCome now, I really must say--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Interrupting, with a sweep of his hand.] Well, well, my dear\r\ndoctor--don\'t let us discuss this any further. We had better agree\r\nto differ. [Changes to a tone of quiet amusement.] But look here now,\r\ndoctor--h\'m--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWell?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSince you don\'t believe that I am--ill--and crazy--and mad, and so\r\nforth--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen I daresay you fancy that I am an extremely happy man.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nIs that mere fancy?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Laughs.] No, no--of course not! Heaven forbid! Only think--to be\r\nSolness the master builder! Halvard Solness! What could be more\r\ndelightful?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nYes, I must say it seems to me you have had the luck on your side to an\r\nastounding degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Suppresses a gloomy smile.] So I have. I can\'t complain on that score.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nFirst of all that grim old robbers\' castle was burnt down for you. And\r\nthat was certainly a great piece of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Seriously.] It was the home of Aline\'s family. Remember that.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nYes, it must have been a great grief to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nShe has not got over it to this day--not in all these twelve or thirteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nBut you--yourself--you rose upon the ruins. You began as a poor boy from\r\na country village--and now you are at the head of your profession. Ah,\r\nyes, Mr. Solness, you have undoubtedly had the luck on your side.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looking at him with embarrassment.] Yes, but that is just what makes me\r\nso horribly afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAfraid? Because you have the luck on your side!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt terrifies me--terrifies me every hour of the day. For sooner or later\r\nthe luck must turn, you see.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nOh nonsense! What should make the luck turn?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With firm assurance.] The younger generation!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nPooh! The younger generation! You are not laid on the shelf yet, I\r\nshould hope. Oh no--your position here is probably firmer now than it\r\nhas ever been.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe luck will turn. I know it--I feel the day approaching. Some one or\r\nother will take it into his head to say: Give me a chance! And then all\r\nthe rest will come clamouring after him, and shake their fists at me and\r\nshout: Make room--make room--! Yes, just you see, doctor--presently the\r\nyounger generation will come knocking at my door--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Laughing.] Well, and what if they do?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat if they do? Then there\'s an end of Halvard Solness.\r\n\r\n     [There is a knock at the door on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Starts.] What\'s that? Did you not hear something?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nSome one is knocking at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Loudly.] Come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HILDA WANGEL enters by the hall door.  She is of middle height,\r\n  supple, and delicately built.  Somewhat sunburnt.  Dressed in\r\n  a tourist costume, with skirt caught up for walking, a sailor\'s\r\n  collar open at the throat, and a small sailor hat on her head.\r\n  Knapsack on back, plaid in strap, and alpenstock.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Goes straight up to SOLNESS, her eyes sparkling with happiness.] Good\r\nevening!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks doubtfully at her.] Good evening--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Laughs.] I almost believe you don\'t recognise me!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo--I must admit that--just for the moment--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Approaching.] But _I_ recognise you, my dear young lady--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Pleased.] Oh, is it you that--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nOf course it is. [To SOLNESS.] We met at one of the mountain stations\r\nthis summer. [To HILDA.] What became of the other ladies?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, they went westward.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t much like all the fun we used to have in the evenings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, I believe they didn\'t.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Holds up his finger at her.] And I am afraid it can\'t be denied that\r\nyou flirted a little with us.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, that was better fun than to sit there knitting stockings with all\r\nthose old women.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Laughs.] There I entirely agree with you!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHave you come to town this evening?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I have just arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nQuite alone, Miss Wangel?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh yes!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWangel? Is your name Wangel?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks in amused surprise at him.] Yes, of course it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen you must be a daughter of the district doctor up at Lysanger?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[As before.] Yes, who else\'s daughter should I be?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, then I suppose we met up there, that summer when I was building a\r\ntower on the old church.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[More seriously.] Yes, of course it was then we met.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, that is a long time ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks hard at him.] It is exactly ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou must have been a mere child then, I should think.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Carelessly.] Well, I was twelve or thirteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nIs this the first time you have ever been up to town, Miss Wangel?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, it is indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd don\'t you know any one here?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNobody but you. And of course, your wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSo you know her, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOnly a little. We spent a few days together at the sanatorium.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAh, up there?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nShe said I might come and pay her a visit if ever I came up to town.\r\n[Smiles.] Not that that was necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOdd that she should never have mentioned it.\r\n\r\n     [HILDA puts her stick down by the stove, takes off the knapsack\r\n       and lays it and the plaid on the sofa.  DR. HERDAL offers to\r\n       help her.  SOLNESS stands and gazes at her.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Going towards him.] Well, now I must ask you to let me stay the night\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI am sure there will be no difficulty about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFor I have no other clothes than those I stand in, except a change of\r\nlinen in my knapsack. And that has to go to the wash, for it\'s very\r\ndirty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, that can be managed. Now I\'ll just let my wife know--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I will go and see my patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, do; and come again later on.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Playfully, with a glance at HILDA.] Oh that I will, you may be very\r\ncertain! [Laughs.] So your prediction has come true, Mr. Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHow so?\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThe younger generation did come knocking at your door.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Cheerfully.] Yes, but in a very different way from what I meant.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nVery different, yes. That\'s undeniable.\r\n\r\n     [He goes out by the hall-door.  SOLNESS opens the door on the\r\n       right and speaks into the side room.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAline! Will you come in here, please. Here is a friend of yours--Miss\r\nWangel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Appears in the doorway.] Who do you say it is? [Sees HILDA.]. Oh, is it\r\nyou, Miss Wangel?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nMiss Wangel has this moment arrived; and she would like to stay the\r\nnight here.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHere with us? Oh yes, certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nTill she can get her things a little in order, you know.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI will do the best I can for you. It\'s no more than my duty. I suppose\r\nyour trunk is coming on later?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI have no trunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, it will be all right, I daresay. In the meantime, you must excuse\r\nmy leaving you here with my husband, until I can get a room made a\r\nlittle more comfortable for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nCan we not give her one of the nurseries? They are all ready as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes. There we have room and to spare. [To HILDA.] Sit down now, and\r\nrest a little. [She goes out to the right.\r\n\r\n     [HILDA, with her hands behind her back, strolls about the room\r\n       and looks at various objects.  SOLNESS stands in front, beside\r\n       the table, also with his hands behind his back, and follows\r\n       her with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Stops and looks at him.] Have you several nurseries?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThere are three nurseries in the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat\'s a lot. Then I suppose you have a great many children?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo. We have no child. But now you can be the child here, for the time\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFor to-night, yes. I shall not cry. I mean to sleep as sound as a stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, you must be very tired, I should think.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh no! But all the same--. It\'s so delicious to lie and dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDo you dream much of nights?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh yes! Almost always.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat do you dream about most?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI sha\'n\'t tell you to-night. Another time perhaps.\r\n\r\n     [She again strolls about the room, stops at the desk and turns\r\n       over the books and papers a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Approaching.] Are you searching for anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, I am merely looking at all these things. [Turns.] Perhaps I mustn\'t?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, by all means.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIs it you that writes in this great ledger?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, it\'s my book-keeper.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIs it a woman?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Smiles.] Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOne you employ here, in your office?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIs she married?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, she is single.\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, indeed!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut I believe she is soon going to be married.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat\'s a good thing for her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut not such a good thing for me. For then I shall have nobody to help\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nCan\'t you get hold of some one else who will do just as well?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you would stay here and--and write in the ledger?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Measures him with a glance.] Yes, I daresay! No, thank you--nothing of\r\nthat sort for me.\r\n\r\n     [She again strolls across the room, and sits down on the\r\n       rocking-chair.  SOLNESS too goes to the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Continuing.] For there must surely be plenty of other thing to be done\r\nhere. [Looks smilingly at him.] Don\'t you think so, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOf course. First of all, I suppose, you want to make a round of the\r\nshops, and get yourself up in the height of fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Amused.] No, I think I shall let that alone!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIndeed?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFor you must know I have run through all my money.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Laughs.] Neither trunk nor money, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNeither one nor the other. But never mind--it doesn\'t matter now.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nCome now, I like you for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOnly for that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFor that among other things. [Sits in the arm-chair.] Is your father\r\nalive still?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, father\'s alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are thinking of studying here?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, that hadn\'t occurred to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose you will be staying for some time?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat must depend upon circumstances.\r\n\r\n     [She sits awhile rocking herself and looking at him, half\r\n       seriously, half with a suppressed smile.  Then she takes\r\n       off her hat and puts it on the table in front of her.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nMr. Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHave you a very bad memory?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nA bad memory? No, not that I am aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen have you nothing to say to me about what happened up there?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In momentary surprise.] Up at Lysanger? [Indifferently.] Why, it was\r\nnothing much to talk about it seems to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks reproachfully at him.] How can you sit there and say such things?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, then, you talk to me about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhen the tower was finished, we had grand doings in the town.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I shall not easily forget that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Smiles.] Will you not? That comes well from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nComes well?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThere was music in the churchyard--and many, many hundreds of people. We\r\nschool-girls were dressed in white; and we all carried flags.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAh yes, those flags--I can tell you I remember them!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen you climbed right up the scaffolding, straight to the very top; and\r\nyou had a great wreath with you; and you hung that wreath right away up\r\non the weather-vane.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Curtly interrupting.] I always did that in those days. It is an old\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt was so wonderfully thrilling to stand below and look up at you.\r\nFancy, if he should fall over! He--the master builder himself!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[As if to divert her from the subject.] Yes, yes, yes, that might\r\nvery will have happened, too. For one of those white-frocked little\r\ndevils,--she went on in such a way, and screamed up at me so--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Sparkling with pleasure.] "Hurrah for Master Builder Solness!" Yes!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS. --and waved and flourished with her flag, so that I--so that it\r\nalmost made me giddy to look at it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[In a lower voice, seriously.] That little devil--that was _I_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Fixes his eyes steadily upon her.] I am sure of that now. It must have\r\nbeen you.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Lively again.] Oh, it was so gloriously thrilling! I could not have\r\nbelieved there was a builder in the whole world that could build such a\r\ntremendously high tower. And then, that you yourself should stand at the\r\nvery top of it, as large as life! And that you should not be the least\r\nbit dizzy! It was that above everything that made one--made one dizzy to\r\nthink of.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHow could you be so certain that I was not?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Scouting the idea.] No indeed! Oh no! I knew that instinctively. For if\r\nyou had been, you could never have stood up there and sung.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at her in astonishment.] Sung? Did _I_ sing?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I should think you did.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Shakes his head.] I have never sung a note in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, you sang then. It sounded like harps in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Thoughtfully.] This is very strange--all this.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Is silent awhile, looks at him and says in a low voice:] But then,--it\r\nwas after that--that the real thing happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe real thing?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Sparking with vivacity.] Yes, I surely don\'t need to remind you of\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes do remind me a little of that, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDon\'t you remember that a great dinner was given in your honour at the\r\nClub?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, to be sure. It must have been the same afternoon, for I left the\r\nplace next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd from the Club you were invited to come round to our house to supper.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nQuite right, Miss Wangel. It is wonderful how all these trifles have\r\nimpressed themselves on your mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nTrifles! I like that! Perhaps it was a trifle, too, that I was alone in\r\nthe room when you came in?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWere you alone?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Without answering him.] You didn\'t call me a little devil then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, I suppose I did not.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou said I was lovely in my white dress, and that I looked like a little\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt you did, Miss Wangel.--And besides--I was feeling so\r\nbuoyant and free that day--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd then you said that when I grew up I should be your princess.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Laughing a little.] Dear, dear--did I say that too?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, you did. And when I asked how long I should have to wait, you\r\nsaid that you would come again in ten years--like a troll--and carry me\r\noff--to Spain or some such place. And you promised you would buy me a\r\nkingdom there.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[As before.] Yes, after a good dinner one doesn\'t haggle about the\r\nhalfpence. But did I really say all that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Laughs to herself.] Yes. And you told me, too, what the kingdom was to\r\nbe called.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, what was it?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt was to be called the kingdom of Orangia,* you said.\r\n\r\n  *In the original "Appelsinia," "appelsin" meaning "orange."\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, that was an appetising name.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, I didn\'t like it a bit; for it seemed as though you wanted to make\r\ngame of me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI am sure that cannot have been my intention.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, I should hope not--considering what you did next--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat in the world did I do next?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, that\'s the finishing touch, if you have forgotten that too. I\r\nshould have thought no one could help remembering such a thing as that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, just give me a hint, and then perhaps---- Well?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks fixedly at him.] You came and kissed me, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Open-mouthed.] _I_ did!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed you did. You took me in both your arms, and bent my head\r\nback, and kissed me--many times.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNow really, my dear Miss Wangel--!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Rises.] You surely cannot mean to deny it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I do. I deny it altogether!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks scornfully at him.] Oh, indeed!\r\n\r\n       [She turns and goes slowly up to the stove, where she remains\r\n       standing motionless, her face averted from him, her hands\r\n       behind her back.  Short pause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Goes cautiously up behind her.] Miss Wangel--!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Is silent and does not move.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDon\'t stand there like a statue. You must have dreamt all this. [Lays\r\nhis hand on her arm.] Now just listen--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Makes an impatient movement with her arm.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[As a thought flashes upon him.] Or--! Wait a moment! There is something\r\nunder all this, you may depend!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Does not move.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In a low voice, but with emphasis.] I must have thought all that. I\r\nmust have wished it--have willed it--have longed to do it. And then--.\r\nMay not that be the explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Is still silent.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Impatiently.] Oh very well, deuce take it all--then I did do it, I\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Turns her head a little, but without looking at him.] Then you admit it\r\nnow?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes--whatever you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou came and put your arms round me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd bent my head back?\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nVery far back.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd kissed me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I did.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nMany times?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAs many as ever you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Turns quickly toward him and has once more the sparkling expression of\r\ngladness in her eyes.] Well, you see, I got it out of you at last!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a slight smile.] Yes--just think of my forgetting such a thing as\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Again a little sulky, retreats from him.] Oh, you have kissed so many\r\npeople in your time, I suppose.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, you mustn\'t think that of me. [HILDA seats herself in the arm-chair.\r\nSOLNESS stands and leans against the rocking-chair. Looks observantly at\r\nher.] Miss Wangel!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHow was it now? What came of all this--between us two.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhy, nothing more came of it. You know that quite well. For then the\r\nother guests came in, and then--bah!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nQuite so! The others came in. To think of my forgetting that too!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, you haven\'t really forgotten anything: you are only a little ashamed\r\nof it all. I am sure one doesn\'t forget things of that kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, one would suppose not.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Lively again, looks at him.] Perhaps you have even forgotten what day\r\nit was?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat day--?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, on what day did you hang the wreath on the tower? Well? Tell me at\r\nonce!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nH\'m--I confess I have forgotten the particular day. I only know it was\r\nten years ago. Some time in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Nods her head slowly several times.] It was ten years ago--on the 19th\r\nof September.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, it must have been about that time. Fancy your remembering that too!\r\n[Stops.] But wait a moment--! Yes--it\'s the 19th of September today.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, it is; and the ten years are gone. And you didn\'t come--as you had\r\npromised me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nPromised you? Threatened, I suppose you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI don\'t think there was any sort of threat in that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell then, a little bit of fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWas that all you wanted? To make fun of me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, or to have a little joke with you. Upon my soul, I don\'t\r\nrecollect. But it must have been something of that kind; for you were a\r\nmere child then.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, perhaps I wasn\'t quite such a child either. Not such a mere chit as\r\nyou imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks searchingly at her.] Did you really and seriously expect me to\r\ncome again?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Conceals a half-teasing smile.] Yes, indeed! I did expect that of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat I should come back to your home, and take you away with me?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nJust like a troll--yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd make a princess of you?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat\'s what you promised.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd give you a kingdom as well?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks up at the ceiling.] Why not? Of course it need not have been an\r\nactual, every-day sort of a kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut something else just as good?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, at least as good. [Looks at him a moment.] I thought, if you could\r\nbuild the highest church-towers in the world, you could surely manage to\r\nraise a kingdom of one sort or another as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Shakes his head.] I can\'t quite make you out, Miss Wangel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nCan you not? To me it seems all so simple.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, I can\'t make up my mind whether you mean all you say, or are simply\r\nhaving a joke with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Smiles.] Making fun of you, perhaps? I, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, exactly. Making fun--of both of us. [Looks at her.] Is it long\r\nsince you found out that I was married?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI have know it all along. Why do you ask me that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Lightly.] Oh, well, it just occurred to me. [Looks earnestly at her,\r\nand says in a low voice.] What have you come for?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI want my kingdom. The time is up.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Laughs involuntarily.] What a girl you are!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Gaily.] Out with my kingdom, Mr. Solness! [Raps with her fingers.] The\r\nkingdom on the table!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Pushing the rocking-chair nearer and sitting down.] Now, seriously\r\nspeaking--what have you come for? What do you really want to do here?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, first of all, I want to go round and look at all the things that you\r\nhave built.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat will give you plenty of exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I know you have built a tremendous lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI have indeed--especially of late years.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nMany church-towers among the rest? Immensely high ones?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo. I build no more church-towers now. Nor churches either.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat do you build then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHomes for human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Reflectively.] Couldn\'t you build a little--a little bit of a\r\nchurch-tower over these homes as well?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Starting.] What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI mean--something that points--points up into the free air. With the\r\nvane at a dizzy height.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Pondering a little.] Strange that you should say that--for that is just\r\nwhat I am most anxious to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Impatiently.] Why don\'t you do it, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Shakes his head.] No, the people will not have it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFancy their not wanting it!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[More lightly.] But now I am building a new home for myself--just\r\nopposite here.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFor yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes. It is almost finished. And on that there is a tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nA high tower?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nVery high?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo doubt people will say it is too high--too high for a dwelling-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI\'ll go out to look at that tower first thing to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Sits resting his cheek on his hand, and gazes at her.] Tell me, Miss\r\nWangel--what is your name? Your Christian name, I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhy, Hilda, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[As before.] Hilda? Indeed?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDon\'t you remember that? You called me Hilda yourself--that day when you\r\nmisbehaved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDid I really.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut then you said "little Hilda"; and I didn\'t like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, you didn\'t like that, Miss Hilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, not at such a time as that. But--"Princess Hilda"--that will sound\r\nvery well, I think.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nVery well indeed. Princess Hilda of--of--what was to be the name of the\r\nkingdom?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nPooh! I won\'t have anything to do with that stupid kingdom. I have set\r\nmy heart upon quite a different one!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Has leaned back in the chair, still gazing at her.] Isn\'t it strange--?\r\nThe more I think of it now, the more it seems to me as though I had gone\r\nabout all these years torturing myself with--h\'m--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWith what?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWith the effort to recover something--some experience, which I seemed to\r\nhave forgotten. But I never had the least inkling of what it could be.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou should have tied a knot in your pocket-handkerchief, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIn that case, I should simply have had to go racking my brains to\r\ndiscover what the knot could mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh yes, I suppose there are trolls of that kind in the world, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Rises slowly.] What a good thing it is that you have come to me now.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks deeply into his eyes.] Is it a good thing!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFor I have been so lonely here. I have been gazing so helplessly at it\r\nall. [In a lower voice.] I must tell you--I have begun to be afraid of\r\nthe younger generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With a little snort of contempt.] Pooh--is the younger generation\r\nsomething to be afraid of?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed. And that is why I have locked and barred myself in.\r\n[Mysteriously.] I tell you the younger generation will one day come and\r\nthunder at my door! They will break in upon me!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen I should say you ought to go out and open the door to the younger\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOpen the door?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes. Let them come in to you on friendly terms, as it were.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, no, no! The younger generation--it means retribution, you see. It\r\ncomes, as if under a new banner, heralding the turn of fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Rises, looks at him, and says with a quivering twitch of her lips.] Can\r\n_I_ be of any use to you, Mr. Solness?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, you can indeed! For you, too, come--under a new banner it seems to\r\nme. You marshalled against youth--!\r\n\r\n\r\n  DR. HERDAL comes in by the hall-door.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWhat--you and Miss Wangel here still?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes. We have had no end of things to talk about.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBoth old and new.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nHave you really?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, it has been the greatest fun. For Mr. Solness--he has such a\r\nmiraculous memory. All the least little details he remembers instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MRS. SOLNESS enters by the door on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, Miss Wangel, your room is quite ready for you now.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, how kind you are to me!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[To MRS. SOLNESS.] The nursery?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, the middle one. But first let us go in to supper.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Nods to HILDA.] Hilda shall sleep in the nursery, she shall.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him.] Hilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, Miss Wangel\'s name is Hilda. I knew her when she was a child.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDid you really, Halvard? Well, shall we go?\r\n\r\n     [She takes DR. HERDAL\'s arm and goes out with him to the\r\n       right.  HILDA has meanwhile been collecting her travelling\r\n       things.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Softly and rapidly to SOLNESS.] Is it true, what you said? Can I be of\r\nuse to you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Takes the things from her.] You are the very being I have needed most.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him with happy, wondering eyes and clasps her hands.] But\r\nthen, great heavens--!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Eagerly.] What--?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen I have my kingdom!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Involuntarily.] Hilda--!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Again with the quivering twitch of her lips.] Almost--I was going to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n     [She goes out to the right, SOLNESS follows her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT SECOND.\r\n\r\n  A prettily furnished small drawing-room in SOLNESS\'S house.\r\n  In the back, a glass-door leading out to the verandah and\r\n  garden.  The right-hand corner is cut off transversely by\r\n  a large bay-window, in which are flower-stands.  The left-\r\n  hand corner is similarly cut off by a transverse wall, in\r\n  which is a small door papered like the wall.  On each side,\r\n  an ordinary door.  In front, on the right, a console table\r\n  with a large mirror over it.  Well-filled stands of plants\r\n  and flowers.  In front, on the left, a sofa with a table\r\n  and chairs.  Further back, a bookcase.  Well forward in the\r\n  room, before the bay window, a small table and some chairs.\r\n  It is early in the day.\r\n\r\n  SOLNESS sits by the little table with RAGNAR BROVIK\'S\r\n  portfolio open in front of him.  He is turning the drawings\r\n  over and closely examining some of them.  MRS. SOLNESS moves\r\n  about noiselessly with a small watering-pot, attending to her\r\n  flowers.  She is dressed in black as before.  Her hat, cloak\r\n  and parasol lie on a chair near the mirror.  Unobserved by her,\r\n  SOLNESS now and again follows her with his eyes.  Neither of\r\n  them speaks.\r\n\r\n  KAIA FOSLI enters quietly by the door on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is\r\nthat you?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nI merely wished to let you know that I have come.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, that\'s all right. Hasn\'t Ragnar come too?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nNo, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is\r\ncoming presently to hear--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHow is the old man to-day?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nNot well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nYes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo--I don\'t know that I have anything particular to say to him.\r\n\r\n     [KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,\r\n       turning over the drawings.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Over beside the plants.] I wonder if he isn\'t going to die now, as\r\nwell?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks up at her.] As well as who?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Without answering.] Yes, yes--depend upon it, Halvard, old Brovik is\r\ngoing to die too. You\'ll see that he will.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nMy dear Aline, ought you not to go out for a little walk?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I suppose I ought to.\r\n\r\n     [She continues to attend the flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Bending over the drawings.] Is she still asleep?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looking at him.] Is it Miss Wangel you are sitting there thinking\r\nabout?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Indifferently.] I just happened to recollect her.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nMiss Wangle was up long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, was she?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhen I went in to see her, she was busy putting her things in order.\r\n\r\n     [She goes in front of the mirror and slowly begins to put on\r\n       her hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[After a short pause.] So we have found a use for one our nurseries\r\nafter all, Aline.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, we have.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat seems to me better than to have them all standing empty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat emptiness is dreadful; you are right there.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Closes the portfolio, rises and approaches her.] You will find that\r\nwe shall get on far better after this, Aline. Things will be more\r\ncomfortable. Life will be easier--especially for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him.] After this?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, believe me, Aline--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDo you mean--because she has come here?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Checking himself.] I mean, of course--when once we have moved into the\r\nnew home.\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Takes her cloak.] Ah, do you think so, Halvard? Will it be better then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI can\'t think otherwise. And surely you think so too?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI think nothing at all about the new house.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Cast down.] It\'s hard for me to hear you say that; for you know it is\r\nmainly for your sake that I have built it.\r\n\r\n     [He offers to help her on with her cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Evades him.] The fact is, you do far too much for my sake.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a certain vehemence.] No, no, you really mustn\'t say that, Aline!\r\nI cannot bear to hear you say such things!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nVery well, then I won\'t say it, Halvard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut I stick to what _I_ said. You\'ll see that things will be easier for\r\nyou in the new place.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, heavens--easier for me--!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Eagerly.] Yes, indeed they will! You may be quite sure of that! For you\r\nsee--there will be so very, very much there that will remind you of your\r\nown home--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe home that used to be father\'s and mother\'s--and that was burnt to\r\nthe ground--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In a low voice.] Yes, yes, my poor Aline. That was a terrible blow for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Breaking out in lamentation.] You may build as much as ever you like,\r\nHalvard--you can never build up again a real home for me!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Crosses the room.] Well, in Heaven\'s name, let us talk no more about it\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWe are not in the habit of talking about it. For you always put the\r\nthought away from you--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Stops suddenly and looks at her.] Do I? And why should I do that? Put\r\nthe thought away from me?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, Halvard, I understand you very well. You are so anxious to spare\r\nme--and to find excuses for me too--as much as ever you can.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With astonishment in his eyes.] You! Is it you--yourself, that your are\r\ntalking about, Aline?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, who else should it be but myself?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Involuntarily to himself.] That too!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAs for the old house, I wouldn\'t mind so much about that. When once\r\nmisfortune was in the air--why--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAh, you are right there. Misfortune will have its way--as the saying\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut it\'s what came of the fire--the dreadful thing that followed--! That\r\nis the thing! That, that, that!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Vehemently.] Don\'t think about that, Aline!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAh, that is exactly what I cannot help thinking about. And now, at last,\r\nI must speak about it, too; for I don\'t seem to be able to bear it any\r\nlonger. And then never to be able to forgive myself--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Exclaiming.] Yourself--!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, for I had duties on both sides--both towards you and towards the\r\nlittle ones. I ought to have hardened myself--not to have let the\r\nhorror take such hold upon me--nor the grief for the burning of my home.\r\n[Wrings her hands.] Oh, Halvard, if I had only had the strength!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Softly, much moved, comes closer.] Aline--you must promise me never to\r\nthink these thoughts any more.--Promise me that, dear!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, promise, promise! One can promise anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Clenches his hands and crosses the room.] Oh, but this is hopeless,\r\nhopeless! Never a ray of sunlight! Not so much as a gleam of brightness\r\nto light up our home!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThis is no home, Halvard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh no, you may well say that. [Gloomily.] And God knows whether you are\r\nnot right in saying that it will be no better for us in the new house,\r\neither.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt will never be any better. Just as empty--just as desolate--there as\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Vehemently.] Why in all the world have we built it then? Can you tell\r\nme that?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo; you must answer that question for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Glances suspiciously at her.] What do you mean by that, Aline?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, in the devil\'s name! You said it so strangely--as if you had some\r\nhidden meaning in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed, I assure you--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Comes closer.] Oh, come now--I know what I know. I have both my eyes\r\nand my ears about me, Aline--you may depend upon that!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy, what are you talking about? What is it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Places himself in front of her.] Do you mean to say you don\'t find a\r\nkind of lurking, hidden meaning in the most innocent word I happen to\r\nsay?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n_I_ do you say? _I_ do that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Laughs.] Ho-ho-ho! It\'s natural enough, Aline! When you have a sick man\r\non your hands--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Anxiously.] Sick? Are you ill, Halvard?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Violently.] A half-mad man then! A crazy man! Call me what you will.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Feels blindly for a chair and sits down.] Halvard--for God\'s sake--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut you are wrong, both you and the doctor. I am not in the state that\r\nyou imagine.\r\n\r\n     [He walks up and down the room.  MRS. SOLNESS follows him\r\n       anxiously with her eyes.  Finally he goes up to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Calmly.] In reality there is nothing whatever the matter with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, there isn\'t, is there? But then what is it that troubles you so?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy this, that I often feel ready to sink under this terrible burden of\r\ndebt--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDebt, do you say? But you owe no one anything, Halvard!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Softly, with emotion.] I owe a boundless debt to you--to you--to you,\r\nAline.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Rises slowly.] What is behind all this? You may just as well tell me at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut there is nothing behind it! I have never done you any wrong--not\r\nwittingly and willfully, at any rate. And yet--and yet it seems as\r\nthough a crushing debt rested upon me and weighed me down.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nA debt to me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nChiefly to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen you are--ill after all, Halvard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Gloomily.] I suppose I must be--or not far from it. [Looks towards the\r\ndoor to the right, which is opened at this moment.] Ah! now it grows\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HILDA WANGEL comes in.  She has made some alteration in her\r\n  dress, and let down her skirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nGood morning, Mr. Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Nods.] Slept well?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nQuite deliciously! Like a child in a cradle. Oh--I lay and stretched\r\nmyself like--like a princess!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Smiles a little.] You were thoroughly comfortable then?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI should think so.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd no doubt you dreamed, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I did. But that was horrid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWas it?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, for I dreamed I was falling over a frightfully high, sheer\r\nprecipice. Do you never have that kind of dream?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes--now and then--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt\'s tremendously thrilling--when you fall and fall--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt seems to make one\'s blood run cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDo you draw your legs up under you while you are falling?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, as high as ever I can.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nSo do I.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Takes her parasol.] I must go into town now, Halvard. [To HILDA.] And\r\nI\'ll try to get one or two things that you may require.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Making a motion to throw her arms round her neck.] Oh, you dear, Mrs.\r\nSolness! You are really much too kind to me! Frightfully kind--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Deprecatingly, freeing herself.] Oh, not at all. It\'s only my duty, so\r\nI am very glad to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Offended, pouts.] But really, I think I am quite fit to be seen in the\r\nstreets--now that I\'ve put my dress to rights. Or do you think I am not?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, I think people would stare at you a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Contemptuously.] Pooh! Is that all? That only amuses me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With suppressed ill-humour.] Yes, but people might take it into their\r\nheads that you were mad too, you see.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nMad? Are there so many mad people here in town, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Points to his own forehead.] Here you see one at all events.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou--Mr. Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHave you not noticed that yet?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, I certainly have not. [Reflects and laughs a little.] And\r\nyet--perhaps in one single thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAh, do you hear that, Aline?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat is that one single thing, Miss Wangel?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, I won\'t say.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, do!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo thank you--I am not so mad as that.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhen you and Miss Wangel are alone, I daresay she will tell you,\r\nHalvard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAh--you think she will?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, certainly. For you have known her so well in the past. Ever\r\nsince she was a child--you tell me.\r\n\r\n     [She goes out by the door on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[After a little while.] Does your wife dislike me very much?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDid you think you noticed anything of the kind?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDid you notice it yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Evasively.] Aline has become exceedingly shy with strangers of late\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHas she really?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut if only you could get to know her thoroughly--! Ah, she is so\r\ngood--so kind--so excellent a creature--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Impatiently.] But if she is all that--what made her say that about her\r\nduty?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHer duty?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nShe said that she would go out and buy something for me, because it was\r\nher duty. Oh, I can\'t bear that ugly, horrid word!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt sounds so could and sharp, and stinging. Duty--duty--duty. Don\'t you\r\nthink so, too? Doesn\'t it seem to sting you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nH\'m--haven\'t thought much about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, it does. And if she is so good--as you say she is--why should she\r\ntalk in that way?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut, good Lord, what would you have had her say, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nShe might have said she would do it because she had taken a tremendous\r\nfancy to me. She might have said something like that--something really\r\nwarm and cordial, you understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at her.] Is that how you would like to have it?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, precisely. [She wanders about the room, stops at the bookcase and\r\nlooks at the books.] What a lot of books you have.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I have got together a good many.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDo you read them all, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI used to try to. Do you read much?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, never! I have given it up. For it all seems so irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat is just my feeling.\r\n\r\n     [HILDA wanders about a little, stops at the small table, opens\r\n       the portfolio and turns over the contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAre all these your drawings yours?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, they are drawn by a young man whom I employ to help me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nSome one you have taught?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, no doubt he has learnt something from me, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Sits down.] Then I suppose he is very clever. [Looks at a drawing.]\r\nIsn\'t he?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, he might be worse. For my purpose--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh yes--I\'m sure he is frightfully clever.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDo you think you can see that in the drawings?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nPooh--these scrawlings! But if he has been learning from you--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, so far as that goes--there are plenty of people here that have\r\nlearnt from me, and have come to little enough for all that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him and shakes her head.] No, I can\'t for the life of me\r\nunderstand how you can be so stupid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nStupid? Do you think I am so very stupid?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I do indeed. If you are content to go about here teaching all these\r\npeople--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a slight start.] Well, and why not?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Rises, half serious, half laughing.] No indeed, Mr. Solness! What can\r\nbe the good of that? No one but you should be allowed to build. You\r\nshould stand quite alone--do it all yourself. Now you know it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Involuntarily.] Hilda--!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHow in the world did that come into your head?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDo you think I am so very far wrong then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, that\'s not what I mean. But now I\'ll tell you something.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI keep on--incessantly--in silence and alone--brooding on that very\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, that seems to me perfectly natural.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks somewhat searchingly at her.] Perhaps you have noticed it\r\nalready?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed I haven\'t.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut just now--when you said you thought I was--off my balance? In one\r\nthing, you said--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, I was thinking of something quite different.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI am not going to tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Crosses the room.] Well, well--as you please. [Stops at the\r\nbow-window.] Come here, and I will show you something.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Approaching.] What is it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDo you see over here in the garden--?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Points.] Right above the great quarry--?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat new house, you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe one that is being built, yes. Almost finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have a very high tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe scaffolding is still up.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIs that your new house?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThe house you are soon going to move into?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him.] Are there nurseries in that house, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThree, as there are here.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd no child.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd there never will be one.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With a half-smile.] Well, isn\'t it just as I said--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat--?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat you are a little--a little mad after all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWas that what you were thinking of?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, of all the empty nurseries I slept in.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Lowers his voice.] We have had children--Aline and I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks eagerly at him.] Have you--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nTwo little boys. They were of the same age.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nTwins, then.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, twins. It\'s eleven or twelve years ago now.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Cautiously.] And so both of them--? You have lost both the twins, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With quiet emotion.] We kept them only about three weeks. Or scarcely\r\nso much. [Bursts forth.] Oh, Hilda, I can\'t tell you what a good thing\r\nit is for me that you have come! For now at last I have some one to talk\r\nto!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nCan you not talk to--her, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNot about this. Not as I want to talk and must talk. [Gloomily.] And not\r\nabout so many other things, either.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[In a subdued voice.] Was that all you meant when you said you need me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat was mainly what I meant--at all events, yesterday. For to-day I am\r\nnot so sure--[Breaking off.] Come here and let us sit down, Hilda. Sit\r\nthere on the sofa--so that you can look into the garden. [HILDA seats\r\nherself in the corner of the sofa. SOLNESS brings a chair closer.]\r\nShould you like to hear about it?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I shall love to sit and listen to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Sits down.] Then I will tell you all about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNow I can see both the garden and you, Mr. Solness. So now, tell away!\r\nBegin!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Points towards the bow-window.] Out there on the rising ground--where\r\nyou see the new house--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAline and I lived there in the first years of our married life. There\r\nwas an old house up there that had belonged to her mother; and we\r\ninherited it, and the whole of the great garden with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWas there a tower on that house, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, nothing of the kind. From the outside it looked like a great, dark,\r\nugly wooden box; but all the same, it was snug and comfortable enough\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen did you pull down the ramshackle old place?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, it was burnt down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThe whole of it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWas that a great misfortune for you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat depends on how you look at it. As a builder, the fire was the\r\nmaking of me--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, but--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt was just after the birth of the two little boys--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThe poor little twins, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThey came healthy and bonny into the world. And they were growing\r\ntoo--you could see the difference day to day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nLittle children do grow quickly at first.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt was the prettiest sight in the world to see Aline lying with the two\r\nof them in her arms.--But then came the night of the fire--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Excitedly.] What happened? Do tell me! Was any one burnt?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, not that. Every one got safe and sound out of the house--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, and what then--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe fright had shaken Aline terribly. The alarm--the escape--the\r\nbreak-neck hurry--and then the ice-cold night air--for they had to be\r\ncarried out just as they lay--both she and the little ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWas it too much for them?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh no, they stood it well enough. But Aline fell into a fever, and it\r\naffected her milk. She would insist on nursing them herself; because it\r\nwas her duty, she said. And both our little boys, they--[Clenching his\r\nhands.]--they--oh!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThey did not get over that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, that they did not get over. That was how we lost them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt must have been terribly hard for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHard enough for me; but ten time harder for Aline. [Clenching his hands\r\nin suppressed fury.] Oh, that such things should be allowed to happen\r\nhere the world! [Shortly and firmly.] From the day I lost them, I had no\r\nheart for building churches.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDid you not like building the church-tower in our town?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t like it. I know how free and happy I felt when that tower was\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n_I_ know that, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd now I shall never--never build anything of that sort again! Neither\r\nchurches nor church-towers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Nods slowly.] Nothing but houses for people to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHomes for human beings, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut homes with high towers and pinnacles upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIf possible. [Adopts a lighter tone.] But, as I said before, that fire\r\nwas the making of me--as a builder, I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhy don\'t you call yourself an architect, like the others?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI have not been systematically enough taught for that. Most of what I\r\nknow I have found out for myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut you succeeded all the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, thanks to the fire. I laid out almost the whole of the garden in\r\nvilla lots; and there I was able to build after my own heart. So I came\r\nto the front with a rush.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks keenly at him.] You must surely be a very happy man, as matters\r\nstand with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Gloomily.] Happy? Do you say that, too--like all the rest of them?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I should say you must be. If you could only cease thing about the\r\ntwo little children--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Slowly.] The two little children--they are not so easy to forget,\r\nHilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Somewhat uncertainly.] Do you still feel their loss so much--after all\r\nthese years?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks fixedly at her, without replying.] A happy man you said--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, now, are you not happy--in other respects?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Continues to look at her.] When I told you all this about the\r\nfire--h\'m--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWas there not one special thought that you--that you seized upon?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Reflects in vain.] No. What thought should that be?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With subdued emphasis.] It was simply and solely by that fire that I\r\nwas enabled to build homes for human beings. Cosy, comfortable, bright\r\nhomes, where father and mother and the whole troop of children can live\r\nin safety and gladness, feeling what a happy thing it is to be alive in\r\nthe world--and most of all to belong to each other--in great things and\r\nin small.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Ardently.] Well, and is it not a great happiness for you to be able to\r\nbuild such beautiful homes?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe price, Hilda! The terrible price I had to pay for the opportunity!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut can you never get over that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo. That I might build homes for others, I had to forego--to forego\r\nfor all time--the home that might have been my own. I mean a home for a\r\ntroop of children--and for father and mother, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Cautiously.] But need you have done that? For all time, you say?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Nods slowly.] That was the price of this happiness that people talk\r\nabout. [Breathes heavily.] This happiness--h\'m--this happiness was not\r\nto be bought any cheaper, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[As before.] But may it not come right even yet?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNever in this world--never. That is another consequence of the fire--and\r\nof Aline\'s illness afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him with an indefinable expression.] And yet you build all\r\nthese nurseries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Seriously.] Have you never noticed, Hilda, how the impossible--how it\r\nseems to beckon and cry aloud to one?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Reflecting.] The impossible? [With animation.] Yes, indeed! Is that how\r\nyou feel too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I do.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen there must be--a little of the troll in you too.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy of the troll?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat would you call it, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Rises.] Well, well, perhaps you are right. [Vehemently.] But how can\r\nI help turning into a troll, when this is how it always goes with me in\r\neverything--in everything!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHow do you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Speaking low, with inward emotion.] Mark what I say to you, Hilda.\r\nAll that I have succeeded in doing, building, creating--all the beauty,\r\nsecurity, cheerful comfort--ay, and magnificence too--[Clenches his\r\nhands.] Oh, is it not terrible even to think of--?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat is so terrible?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat all this I have to make up for, to pay for--not in money, but in\r\nhuman happiness. And not with my own happiness only, but with other\r\npeople\'s too. Yes, yes, do you see that, Hilda? That is the price which\r\nmy position as an artist has cost me--and others. And every single day\r\nI have to look on while the price is paid for me anew. Over again, and\r\nover again--and over again for ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Rises and looks steadily at him.] Now I can see that you are thinking\r\nof--of her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, mainly of Aline. For Aline--she, too, had her vocation in life,\r\njust as much as I had mine. [His voice quivers.] But her vocation has\r\nhad to be stunted, and crushed, and shattered--in order that mine might\r\nforce its way to--to a sort of great victory. For you must know that\r\nAline--she, too, had a talent for building.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nShe! For building?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Shakes his head.] Not houses and towers, and spires--not such things as\r\nI work away at--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, but what then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Softly, with emotion.] For building up the souls of little children,\r\nHilda. For building up children\'s souls in perfect balance, and in\r\nnoble and beautiful forms. For enabling them to soar up into erect and\r\nfull-grown human souls. That was Aline\'s talent. And there it all\r\nlies now--unused and unusable for ever--of no earthly service to any\r\none--just like the ruins left by a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, but even if this were so--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt is so! It is so! I know it!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, but in any case it is not your fault.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Fixes his eyes on her, and nods slowly.] Ah, that is the great, the\r\nterrible question. That is the doubt that is gnawing me--night and day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes. Suppose the fault was mine--in a certain sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYour fault! The fire!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAll of it; the whole thing. And yet, perhaps--I may not have had\r\nanything to do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him with a troubled expression.] Oh, Mr. Solness--if you can\r\ntalk like that, I am afraid you must be--ill after all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nH\'m--I don\'t think I shall ever be of quite sound mind on that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RAGNAR BROVIK cautiously opens the little door in the left-\r\n  hand corner.  HILDA comes forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[When he sees Hilda.] Oh. I beg pardon, Mr. Solness---- [He makes a\r\nmovement to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, no, don\'t go. Let us get it over.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nOh, yes--if only we could.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI hear your father is no better?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nFather is fast growing weaker--and therefore I beg and implore you to\r\nwrite a few kind words for me on one of the plans! Something for father\r\nto read before he--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Vehemently.] I won\'t hear anything more about those drawings of yours!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nHave you looked at them?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes--I have.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nAnd they are good for nothing? And _I_ am good for nothing, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Evasively.] Stay here with me, Ragnar. You shall have everything your\r\nown way. And then you can marry Kaia, and live at your ease--and happily\r\ntoo, who knows? Only don\'t think of building on your own account.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nWell, well, then I must go home and tell father what you say--I promised\r\nI would.--Is this what I am to tell father--before he dies?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a groan.] Oh tell him--tell him what you will, for me. Best to say\r\nnothing at all to him! [With a sudden outburst.] I cannot do anything\r\nelse, Ragnar!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nMay I have the drawings to take with me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, take them--take them by all means! They are lying there on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Goes to the table.] Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Puts her hand on the portfolio.] No, no; leave them here.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBecause I want to look at them, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut you have been---- [To RAGNAR.] Well, leave them here, then.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nVery well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd go home at once to your father.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nYes, I suppose I must.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[As if in desperation.] Ragnar--you must not ask me to do what is beyond\r\nmy power! Do you hear, Ragnar? You must not!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nNo, no. I beg you pardon--\r\n\r\n     [He bows, and goes out by the corner door.  HILDA goes over and\r\n       sits down on a chair near the mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks angrily at SOLNESS.] That was a very ugly thing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDo you think so, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, it was horribly ugly--and hard and bad and cruel as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, you don\'t understand my position.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo matter--. I say you ought not to be like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou said yourself, only just now, that no one but _I_ ought to be\r\nallowed to build.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n_I_ may say such things--but you must not.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI most of all, surely, who have paid so dear for my position.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh yes--with what you call domestic comfort--and that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd with my peace of soul into the bargain.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Rising.] Peace of soul! [With feeling.] Yes, yes, you are right in\r\nthat! Poor Mr. Solness--you fancy that--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a quiet, chuckling laugh.] Just sit down again, Hilda, and I\'ll\r\ntell you something funny.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Sits down; with intent interest.] Well?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt sounds such a ludicrous little thing; for, you see, the whole story\r\nturns upon nothing but a crack in the chimney.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo more than that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, not to begin with.\r\n\r\n     [He moves a chair nearer to HILDA and sits down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Impatiently, taps on her knee.] Well, now for the crack in the chimney!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI had noticed the split in the flue long, long before the fire. Every\r\ntime I went up into the attic, I looked to see if it was still there.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd it was?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes; for no one else knew about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd you said nothing?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd did not think of repairing the flue either?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, I thought about it--but never got any further. Every time I\r\nintended to set to work, it seemed just as if a hand held me back. Not\r\nto-day, I thought--to-morrow; and nothing ever came of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut why did you keep putting it off like that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBecause I was revolving something in my mind. [Slowly, and in a low\r\nvoice.] Through that little black crack in the chimney, I might,\r\nperhaps, force my way upwards--as a builder.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looking straight in front of her.] That must have been thrilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAlmost irresistible--quite irresistible. For at that time it appeared\r\nto me a perfectly simple and straightforward matter. I would have had\r\nit happen in the winter-time--a little before midday. I was to be out\r\ndriving Aline in the sleigh. The servants at home would have made huge\r\nfires in the stoves.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFor, of course, it was to be bitterly cold that day?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nRather biting, yes--and they would want Aline to find it thoroughly snug\r\nand warm when she came home.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI suppose she is very chilly by nature?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nShe is. And as we drove home, we were to see the smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOnly the smoke?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe smoke first. But when we came up to the garden gate, the whole of\r\nthe old timber-box was to be a rolling mass of flames.--That is how I\r\nwanted it to be, you see.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, why, why could it not have happened so!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou may well say that, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, but now listen, Mr. Solness. Are you perfectly certain that the\r\nfire was caused by that little crack in the chimney!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, on the contrary--I am perfectly certain that the crack in the\r\nchimney had nothing whatever to do with the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt has been clearly ascertained that the fire broke out in a\r\nclothes-cupboard--in a totally different part of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen what is all this nonsense you are talking about the crack in the\r\nchimney!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nMay I go on talking to you a little, Hilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, if you\'ll only talk sensibly--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI will try to. [He moves his chair nearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOut with it, then, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Confidentially.] Don\'t you agree with me, Hilda, that there exist\r\nspecial, chosen people who have been endowed with the power and\r\nfaculty if desiring a thing, craving for a thing, willing a thing--so\r\npersistently and so--so inexorably--that at last it has to happen? Don\'t\r\nyou believe that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With an indefinable expression in her eyes.] If that is so, we shall\r\nsee, one of these days, whether _I_ am one of the chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt is not one\'s self alone that can do such great things. Oh, no--the\r\nhelpers and the servers--they must do their part too, if it is to be of\r\nany good. But they never come of themselves. One has to call upon them\r\nvery persistently--inwardly, you understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat are these helpers and servers?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, we can talk about that some other time. For the present, let us keep\r\nto this business of the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDon\'t you think that fire would have happened all the same--even without\r\nyour wishing for it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIf the house had been old Knut Brovik\'s, it would never have burnt down\r\nso conveniently for him. I am sure of that; for he does not know how\r\nto call for the helpers--no, nor for the servers, either. [Rises in\r\nunrest.] So you see, Hilda--it is my fault, after all, that the lives of\r\nthe two little boys had to be sacrificed. And do you think it is not\r\nmy fault, too, that Aline has never been the woman she should and might\r\nhave been--and that she most longed to be?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, but if it is all the work of these helpers and servers--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWho called for the helpers and servers? It was I! And they came and\r\nobeyed my will. [In increasing excitement.] That is what people call\r\nhaving the luck on your side; but I must tell you what this sort of luck\r\nfeels like! It feels like a great raw place here on my breast. And the\r\nhelpers and servers keep on flaying pieces of skin off other people in\r\norder to close my sore!--But still the sore is not healed--never, never!\r\nOh, if you knew how it can sometimes gnaw and burn!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks attentively at him.] You are ill, Mr. Solness. Very ill, I almost\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSay mad; for that is what you mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, I don\'t think there is much amiss with your intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWith what then? Out with it!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether you were not sent into the world with a sickly\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nA sickly conscience? What devilry is that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI mean that your conscience is feeble--too delicately built, as it\r\nwere--hasn\'t strength to take a grip of things--to lift and bear what is\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Growls.] H\'m! May I ask, then, what sort of a conscience one ought to\r\nhave?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI should like your conscience to be--to be thoroughly robust.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIndeed? Robust, eh? Is your own conscience robust, may I ask?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I think it is. I have never noticed that it wasn\'t.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt has not been put very severely to the test, I should think.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With a quivering of the lips.] Oh, it was no such simple matter to\r\nleave father--I am so awfully fond of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDear me! for a month or two--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI think I shall never go home again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNever? Then why did you leave him?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Half-seriously, half-banteringly.] Have you forgotten again that the\r\nten year are up?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh nonsense. Was anything wrong at home? Eh?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Quite seriously.] It was this impulse within me that urged and goaded\r\nme to come--and lured and drew me on, as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Eagerly.] There we have it! There we have it, Hilda! There is the troll\r\nin you too, as in me. For it\'s the troll in one, you see--it is that\r\nthat calls to the powers outside us. And then you must give in--whether\r\nyou will or no.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI almost think you are right, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Walks about the room.] Oh, there are devils innumerable abroad in the\r\nworld, Hilda, that one never sees.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDevils, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Stops.] Good devils and bad devils; light-haired devils and\r\nblack-haired devils. If only you could always tell whether it is the\r\nlight or dark ones that have got hold of you! [Paces about.] Ho-ho! Then\r\nit would be simple enough!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Follows him with her eyes.] Or if one had a really vigorous, radiantly\r\nhealthy conscience--so that one dared to do what one would.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Stops beside the console table.] I believe, now, that most people are\r\njust as puny creatures as I am in that respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI shouldn\'t wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Leaning against the table.] In the sagas--. Have you read any of the\r\nold sagas?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh yes! When I used to read books, I--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIn the sagas you read about vikings, who sailed to foreign lands, and\r\nplundered and burned and killed men--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd carried off women--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS. --and kept them in captivity--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA. --took them home in their ships--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS. --and behaved to them like--like the very worst of trolls.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks straight before her, with a half-veiled look.] I think that must\r\nhave been thrilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a short, deep laugh.] To carry off women, eh?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nTo be carried off.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at her a moment.] Oh, indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[As if breaking the thread of the conversation.] But what made you speak\r\nof these vikings, Mr. Solness?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy, those fellows must have had robust consciences, if you like!\r\nWhen they got home again, they could eat and drink, and be as happy as\r\nchildren. And the women, too! They often would not leave them on any\r\naccount. Can you understand that, Hilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThose women I can understand exceedingly well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOho! Perhaps you could do the same yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nLive--of your own free will--with a ruffian like that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIf it was a ruffian I had come to love--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nCould you come to love a man like that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nGood heavens, you know very well one can\'t choose whom one is going to\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks meditatively at her.] Oh no, I suppose it is the troll within one\r\nthat\'s responsible for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Half-laughing.] And all those blessed devils, that you know so\r\nwell--both the light-haired and the dark-haired ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Quietly and warmly.] Then I hope with all my heart that the devils will\r\nchoose carefully for you, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFor me they have chosen already--once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks earnestly at her.] Hilda--you are like a wild bird of the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFar from it. I don\'t hide myself away under the bushes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, no. There is rather something of the bird of prey in you.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat is nearer it--perhaps. [Very vehemently.] And why not a bird of\r\nprey? Why should not _I_ go a-hunting--I, as well as the rest? Carry off\r\nthe prey I want--if only I can get my claws into it, and do with it as I\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHilda--do you know what you are?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I suppose I am a strange sort of bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo. You are like a dawning day. When I look at you--I seem to be looking\r\ntowards the sunrise.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nTell me, Mr. Solness--are you certain that you have never called me to\r\nyou? Inwardly, you know?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Softly and slowly.] I almost think I must have.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat did you want with me?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou are the younger generation, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Smiles.] That younger generation that you are so afraid of?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Nods slowly.] And which, in my heart, I yearn towards so deeply.\r\n\r\n     [HILDA rises, goes to the little table, and fetches RAGNAR\r\n       BROVIK\'S portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Holds out the portfolio to him.] We were talking of these drawings--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Shortly, waving them away.] Put those things away! I have seen enough\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, but you have to write your approval on them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWrite my approval on them? Never!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut the poor old man is lying at death\'s door! Can\'t you give him and\r\nhis son this pleasure before they are parted? And perhaps he might get\r\nthe commission to carry them out, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, that is just what he would get. He has made sure of that--has my\r\nfine gentleman!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen, good heavens--if that is so--can\'t you tell the least little bit\r\nof a lie for once in a way?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nA lie? [Raging.] Hilda--take those devil\'s drawings out of my sight!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Draws the portfolio a little nearer to herself.] Well, well,\r\nwell--don\'t bite me.--You talk of trolls--but I think you go on like a\r\ntroll yourself. [Looks round.] Where do you keep your pen and ink?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of the sort in here.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Goes towards the door.] But in the office where that young lady is--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nStay where you are, Hilda!--I ought to tell a lie, you say. Oh yes, for\r\nthe sake of his old father I might well do that--for in my time I have\r\ncrushed him, trodden him under foot--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHim, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI needed room for myself. But this Ragnar--he must on no account be\r\nallowed to come to the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow, there is surely no fear of that. If he has nothing in him--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Comes closer, looks at her, and whispers.] If Ragnar Brovik gets his\r\nchance, he will strike me to the earth. Crush me--as I crushed his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nCrush you? Has he the ability for that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, you may depend upon it he has the ability! He is the younger\r\ngeneration that stands ready to knock at my door--to make an end of\r\nHalvard Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him with quiet reproach.] And yet you would bar him out. Fie,\r\nMr. Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe fight I have been fighting has cost heart\'s blood enough.--And I am\r\nafraid, too, that the helpers and servers will not obey me any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen you must go ahead without them. There is nothing else for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt is hopeless, Hilda. The luck is bound to turn. A little sooner or a\r\nlittle later. Retribution is inexorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[In distress, putting her hands over her ears.] Don\'t talk like that! Do\r\nyou want to kill me? To take from me what is more than my life?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThe longing to see you great. To see you, with a wreath in your hand,\r\nhigh, high up upon a church-tower. [Calm again.] Come, out with your\r\npencil now. You must have a pencil about you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Takes out his pocket-book.] I have one here.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Lays the portfolio on the sofa-table.] Very well. Now let us two sit\r\ndown here, Mr. Solness. [SOLNESS seats himself at the table. HILDA\r\nstands behind him, leaning over the back of the chair.] And now we\r\nwell write on the drawings. We must write very, very nicely and\r\ncordially--for this horrid Ruar--or whatever his name is.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Writes a few words, turns his head and looks at her.] Tell me one\r\nthing, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIf you have been waiting for me all these ten years--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy have you never written to me? Then I could have answered you.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Hastily.] No, no, no! That was just what I did not want.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI was afraid the whole thing might fall to pieces.--But we were going to\r\nwrite on the drawings, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSo we were.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Bends forward and looks over his shoulder while he writes.] Mind now,\r\nkindly and cordially! Oh how I hate--how I hate this Ruald--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Writing.] Have you never really cared for any one, Hilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFor any one else, I suppose you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks up at her.] For any one else, yes. Have you never? In all these\r\nten years? Never?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh yes, now and then. When I was perfectly furious with you for not\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen you did take an interest in other people, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nA little bit--for a week or so. Good heavens, Mr. Solness, you surely\r\nknow how such things come about.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHilda--what is it you have come for?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDon\'t waste time talking. The poor old man might go and die in the\r\nmeantime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnswer me, Hilda. What do you want of me?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI want my kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nH\'m--\r\n\r\n\r\n  He gives a rapid glance toward the door on the left, and\r\n  then goes on writing on the drawings.  At the same moment\r\n  MRS. SOLNESS enters.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHere are a few things I have got for you, Miss Wangel. The large parcels\r\nwill be sent later on.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, how very, very kind of you!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOnly my simple duty. Nothing more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Reading over what he has written.] Aline!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDid you notice whether the--the book-keeper was out there?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, of course, she was there.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Puts the drawings in the portfolio.] H\'m--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the desk, as she always is--when _I_ go through the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Rises.] Then I\'ll give this to her and tell her that--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Takes the portfolio from him.] Oh, no, let me have the pleasure of\r\ndoing that! [Goes to the door, but turns.] What is her name?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHer name is Miss Fosli.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nPooh, that sounds so cold! Her Christian name, I mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nKaia--I believe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Opens the door and calls out.] Kaia, come in here! Make haste! Mr.\r\nSolness wants to speak to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  KAIA FOSLI appears at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Looking at him in alarm.] Here I am--?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Handing her the portfolio.] See her, Kaia! You can take this home; Mr.\r\nSolness was written on them now.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nOh, at last!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nGive them to the old man as soon as you can.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nI will go straight home with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, do. Now Ragnar will have a chance of building for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nOh, may he come and thank you for all--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Harshly.] I won\'t have any thanks! Tell him that from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\nYes, I will--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd tell him at the same time that henceforward I do not require his\r\nservices--nor yours either.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[Softly and quiveringly.] Not mine either?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou will have other things to think of now, and to attend to; and that\r\nis a very good thing for you. Well, go home with the drawings now, Miss\r\nFosli. At once! Do you hear?\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIA.\r\n\r\n[As before.] Yes, Mr. Solness. [She goes out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHeavens! what deceitful eyes she has.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nShe? That poor little creature?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh--I can see what I can see, Halvard.----Are you really dismissing\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHer as well?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWas not that what you wished?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut how can you get on without her--? Oh well, no doubt you have some\r\none else in reserve, Halvard.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Playfully.] Well, _I_ for one am not the person to stand at a desk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNever mind, never mind--it will be all right, Aline. Now all you have to\r\ndo is think about moving into our new home--as quickly as you can. This\r\nevening we will hang up the wreath--[Turns to HILDA.] What do you say to\r\nthat, Miss Hilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks at him with sparkling eyes.] It will be splendid to see you so\r\nhigh up once more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nMe!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFor Heaven\'s sake, Miss Wangel, don\'t imagine such a thing! My\r\nhusband!--when he always gets so dizzy!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHe get dizzy! No, I know quite well he does not!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, indeed he does.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut I have seen him with my own eyes right up at the top of a high\r\nchurch-tower!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I hear people talk of that; but it is utterly impossible--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Vehemently.] Impossible--impossible, yes! But there I stood all the\r\nsame!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nO, how can you say so, Halvard? Why, you can\'t even bear to go out on\r\nthe second-storey balcony here. You have always been like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps see something different this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In alarm.] No, no, no! Please God I shall never see that. I will write\r\nat once to the doctor--and I am sure he won\'t let you do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy, Aline--!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, you know you\'re ill, Halvard. This proves it! Oh God--Oh God!\r\n\r\n     [She goes hastily out to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks intently at him.] Is it so, or is it not?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat I turn dizzy?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat my master builder dares not--cannot--climb as high as he builds?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIs that the way you look at it?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI believe there is scarcely a corner in me that is safe from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks towards the bow-window.] Up there, then. Right up there--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Approaches her.] You might have the topmost room in the tower,\r\nHilda--there you might live like a princess.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Indefinably, between earnest and jest.] Yes, that is what you promised\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDid I really?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nFie, Mr. Solness! You said I should be a princess, and that you would\r\ngive me a kingdom. And then you went and--Well!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Cautiously.] Are you quite certain that this is not a dream--a fancy,\r\nthat has fixed itself in your mind?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Sharply.] Do you mean that you did not do it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI scarcely know myself. [More softly.] But now I know so much for\r\ncertain, that I--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat you--? Say it at once!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS. --that I ought to have done it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Exclaims with animation.] Don\'t tell me you can ever be dizzy!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThis evening, then, we will hang up the wreath--Princess Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With a bitter curve of the lips.] Over your new home, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOver the new house, which will never be a home for me.\r\n\r\n     [He goes out through the garden door.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks straight in front of her with a far-away expression, and whispers\r\nto herself. The only words audible are:]--frightfully thrilling--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THIRD.\r\n\r\n  The large broad verandah of SOLNESS\'S dwelling-house.  Part\r\n  of the house, with outer door leading to the verandah, is\r\n  seen to the left.  A railing along the verandah to the right.\r\n  At the back, from the end of the verandah, a flight of steps\r\n  leads down to the garden below.  Tall old trees in the\r\n  garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards\r\n  the house.  Far to the right, in among the trees, a glimpse\r\n  is caught of the lower part of the new villa, with scaffolding\r\n  round so much as is seen of the tower.  In the background\r\n  the garden is bounded by an old wooden fence.  Outside the\r\n  fence, a street with low, tumble-down cottages.\r\n\r\n  Evening sky with sun-lit clouds.\r\n\r\n  On the verandah, a garden bench stands along the wall of the\r\n  house, and in front of the bench a long table.  On the other\r\n  side of the table, an arm-chair and some stools.  All the\r\n  furniture is of wicker-work.\r\n\r\n  MRS. SOLNESS, wrapped in a large white crepe shawl, sits\r\n  resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right.\r\n  Shortly after, HILDA WANGEL comes up the flight of steps\r\n  from the garden.  She is dressed as in the last act, and\r\n  wears her hat.  She has in her bodice a little nosegay of\r\n  small common flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Turning her head a little.] Have you been round the garden, Miss\r\nWangel?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I have been taking a look at it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd found some flowers too, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAre there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Closer.] What! Don\'t you take a run down into the garden every day,\r\nthen?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a faint smile.] I don\'t "run" anywhere, nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely\r\nthings there?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYour own garden!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI don\'t feel that it is mine any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean--?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, no, it is not--not as it was in my mother\'s and father\'s time. They\r\nhave taken away so much--so much of the garden, Miss Wangel. Fancy--they\r\nhave parcelled it out--and built houses for strangers--people that I\r\ndon\'t know. And they can sit and look in upon me from their windows.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With a bright expression.] Mrs. Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nMay I stay here with you a little?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, by all means, if you care to.\r\n\r\n     [HILDA moves a stool close to the arm-chair and sits down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAh--here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Lays her hand softly on HILDA\'S neck.] It is nice of you to be willing\r\nto sit with me. I thought you wanted to go in to my husband.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat should I want with him?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nTo help him, I thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, thank you. And besides, he is not in. He is over there with his\r\nworkmen. But he looked so fierce that I did not dare to talk to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHe is so kind and gentle in reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHe!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou do not really know him yet, Miss Wangel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks affectionately at her.] Are you pleased at the thought of moving\r\nover to the new house?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI ought to be pleased; for it is what Halvard wants--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, not just on that account, surely?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, Miss Wangel; for it is only my duty to submit myself to\r\nhim. But very often it is dreadfully difficult to force one\'s mind to\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, that must be difficult indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI can tell you it is--when one has so many faults as I have--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhen one has gone through so much trouble as you have--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHow do you know about that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYour husband told me.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nTo me he very seldom mentions these things.--Yes, I can tell you I have\r\ngone through more than enough trouble in my life, Miss Wangel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks sympathetically at her and nods slowly.] Poor Mrs. Solness. First\r\nof all there was the fire--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With a sigh.] Yes, everything that was mine was burnt.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd then came what was worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looking inquiringly at her.] Worse?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThe worst of all.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Softly.] You lost the two little boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, yes, the boys. But, you see, that was a thing apart. That was a\r\ndispensation of Providence; and in such things one can only bow in\r\nsubmission--yes, and be thankful, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen you are so?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNot always, I am sorry to say. I know well enough that it is my\r\nduty--but all the same I cannot.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, no, I think that is only natural.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd often and often I have to remind myself that it was a righteous\r\npunishment for me--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBecause I had not fortitude enough in misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut I don\'t see that--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, no, no, Miss Wangel--do not talk to me any more about the two little\r\nboys. We ought to feel nothing but joy in thinking of them; for they are\r\nso happy--so happy now. No, it is the small losses in life that cut\r\none to the heart--the loss of all that other people look upon as almost\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Lays her arms on MRS. SOLNESS\'S knees, and looks up at her\r\naffectionately.] Dear Mrs. Solness--tell me what things you mean!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAs I say, only little things. All the old portraits were burnt on the\r\nwalls. And all the old silk dresses were burnt, what had belonged to\r\nthe family for generations and generations. And all mother\'s and\r\ngrandmother\'s lace--that was burnt, too. And only think--the jewels,\r\ntoo! [Sadly.] And then all the dolls.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThe dolls?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Choking with tears.] I had nine lovely dolls.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd they were burnt too?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAll of them. Oh, it was hard--so hard for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHad you put by all these dolls, then? Ever since you were little?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI had not put them by. The dolls and I had gone on living together.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAfter you were grown up?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, long after that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAfter you were married, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, indeed. So long as he did not see it--. But they were all burnt\r\nup, poor things. No one thought of saving them. Oh, it is so miserable\r\nto think of. You mustn\'t laugh at me, Miss Wangel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI am not laughing in the least.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFor you see, in a certain sense, there was life in them, too. I carried\r\nthem under my heart--like little unborn children.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DR. HERDAL, with his hat in his hand, comes out through the\r\n  door, and observes MRS. SOLNESS. and HILDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWell, Mrs. Solness, so you are sitting out here catching cold?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI find it so pleasant and warm here to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nYes, yes. But is there anything going on here? I got a note from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Rises.] Yes, there is something I must talk to you about.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nVery well; then perhaps we better go in. [To HILDA.] Still in your\r\nmountaineering dress, Miss Wangel?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Gaily, rising.] Yes--in full uniform! But to-day I am not going\r\nclimbing and breaking my neck. We two will stop quietly below and look\r\non, doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to look on at?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Softly, in alarm, to HILDA.] Hush, hush--for God\'s sake! He is coming!\r\nTry to get that idea out of his head. And let us be friends, Miss\r\nWangel. Don\'t you think we can?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Throws her arms impetuously round MRS. SOLNESS\'S neck.] Oh, if we only\r\ncould!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Gently disengages herself.] There, there, there! There he comes,\r\ndoctor. Let me have a word with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nIs it about him?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, to be sure it\'s about him. Do come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n  She and the doctor enter the house.  Next moment SOLNESS\r\n  comes up from the garden by the flight of steps.  A serious\r\n  look comes over HILDA\'S face.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Glances at the house-door, which is closed cautiously from within.]\r\nHave you noticed, Hilda, that as soon as I come, she goes?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that as soon as you come, you make her go.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps so. But I cannot help it. [Looks observantly at her.] Are you\r\ncold, Hilda? I think you look cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI have just come up out of a tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat I have got chilled through and through, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Slowly.] I believe I understand--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat brings you up here just now?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI caught sight of you from over there.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nBut then you must have seen her too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI knew she would go at once if I came.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIs it very painful for you that she should avoid you in this way?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIn one sense, it\'s a relief as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNot to have her before your eyes?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNot to be always seeing how heavily the loss of the little boys weighs\r\nupon her?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes. Chiefly that.\r\n\r\n     [HILDA drifts across the verandah with her hands behind her\r\n       back, stops at the railing and looks out over the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[After a short pause.] Did you have a long talk with her?\r\n\r\n     [HILDA stands motionless and does not answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHad you a long talk, I asked? [HILDA is silent as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat was she talking about, Hilda? [HILDA continues silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nPoor Aline! I suppose it was about the little boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     [A nervous shudder runs through her; then she nods hurriedly\r\n       once or twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nShe will never get over it--never in this world. [Approaches her.]\r\nNow you are standing there again like a statue; just as you stood last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Turns and looks at him, with great serious eyes.] I am going away.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Sharply.] Going away!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut I won\'t allow you to!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat am I to do here now?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSimply to be here, Hilda!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Measures him with a look.] Oh, thank you. You know it wouldn\'t end\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Heedlessly.] So much the better!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Vehemently.] I cannot do any harm to one whom I know! I can\'t take away\r\nanything that belongs to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWho wants you to do that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Continuing.] A stranger, yes! for that is quite a different thing! A\r\nperson I have never set eyes on. But one that I have come into close\r\ncontact with--! Oh no! Oh no! Ugh!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, but I never proposed you should.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, Mr. Solness, you know quite well what the end of it would be. And\r\nthat is why I am going away.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd what is to become of me when you are gone? What shall I have to live\r\nfor then?--After that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With the indefinable look in her eyes.] It is surely not so hard for\r\nyou. You have your duties to her. Live for those duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nToo late. These powers--these--these--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA. --devils--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, these devils! And the troll within me as well--they have drawn all\r\nthe life-blood out of her. [Laughs in desperation.] They did it for my\r\nhappiness! Yes, yes! [Sadly.] And now she is dead--for my sake. And I\r\nam chained alive to a dead woman. [In wild anguish.] _I_--_I_ who cannot\r\nlive without joy in life!\r\n\r\n     [HILDA moves round the table and seats herself on the bench,\r\n       with her elbows on the table, and her head supported by her\r\n       hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Sits and looks at him awhile.] What will you build next?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Shakes his head.] I don\'t believe I shall build much more.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNot those cosy, happy homes for mother and father, and for the troop of\r\nchildren?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether there will be any use for such homes in the coming\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Solness! And you have gone all these ten years--and staked your\r\nwhole life--on that alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, you may well say so, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With an outburst.] Oh, it all seems to me so foolish--so foolish!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAll what?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNot to be able to grasp at your own happiness--at your own life! Merely\r\nbecause some one you know happens to stand in the way!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOne whom you have no right to set aside.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether one really has not the right! And yet, and yet--. Oh!\r\nif one could only sleep the whole thing away!\r\n\r\n     [She lays her arms flat don on the table, rests the left side of\r\n       her head on her hands, and shuts her eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Turns the arm-chair and sits down at the table.] Had you a cosy, happy\r\nhome--up there with your father, Hilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Without stirring, answers as if half asleep.] I had only a cage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd you are determined not to go back to it?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[As before.] The wild bird never wants to go back to the cage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nRather range through the free air--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Still as before.] The bird of prey loves to range--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Lets his eyes rest on her.] If only one had the viking-spirit in life--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[In her usual voice; opens her eyes but does not move.] And the other\r\nthing? Say what that was!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nA robust conscience.\r\n\r\n     [HILDA sits erect on the bench, with animation.  Her eyes have\r\n       once more the sparkling expression of gladness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Nods to him.] _I_ know what you are going to build next!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen you know more than I do, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, builders are such stupid people.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat is it to be then?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Nods again.] The castle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhat castle?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nMy castle, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDo you want a castle now?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDon\'t you owe me a kingdom, I should like to know?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou say I do.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWell--you admit you owe me this kingdom. And you can\'t have a kingdom\r\nwithout a royal castle, I should think.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[More and more animated.] Yes, they usually go together.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nGood! Then build it for me! This moment!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Laughing.] Must you have that on the instant, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, to be sure! For the ten years are up now, and I am not going to\r\nwait any longer. So--out with the castle, Mr. Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no light matter to owe you anything, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou should have thought of that before. It is too late now. So--[tapping\r\nthe table]--the castle on the table! It is my castle! I will have it at\r\nonce!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[More seriously, leans over towards her, with his arms on the table.]\r\nWhat sort of castle have you imagined, Hilda?\r\n\r\n     [Her expression becomes more and more veiled.  She seems gazing\r\n       inwards at herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Slowly.] My castle shall stand on a height--on a very great\r\nheight--with a clear outlook on all sides, so that I can see far--far\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd no doubt it is to have a high tower!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nA tremendously high tower. And at the very top of the tower there shall\r\nbe a balcony. And I will stand out upon it--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Involuntarily clutches at his forehead.] How can you like to stand at\r\nsuch a dizzy height--?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, I will! Right up there will I stand and look down on the other\r\npeople--on those that are building churches, and homes for mother and\r\nfather and the troop of children. And you may come up and look on at it,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In a low tone.] Is the builder to be allowed to come up beside the\r\nprincess?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIf the builder will.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[More softly.] Then I think the builder will come.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Nods.] The builder--he will come.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut he will never be able to build any more. Poor builder!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Animated.] Oh, yes, he will! We two will set to work together. And then\r\nwe will build the loveliest--the very loveliest--thing in all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Intently.] Hilda--tell me what that is!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks smilingly at him, shakes her head a little, pouts, and speaks as\r\nif to a child.] Builders--they are such very--very stupid people.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, no doubt they are stupid. But now tell me what it is--the loveliest\r\nthing in the world--that we two are to build together?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Is silent a little while, then says with an indefinable expression in\r\nher eyes.] Castles in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nCastles in the air?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Nods.] Castles in the air, yes! Do you know what sort of thing a castle\r\nin the air is?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt is the loveliest thing in the world, you say.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Rises with vehemence, and makes a gesture of repulsion with her hand.]\r\nYes, to be sure it is! Castles in the air--they are so easy to build,\r\ntoo--[looks scornfully at him]--especially for the builders who have\r\na--a dizzy conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Rises.] After this day we two will build together, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With a half-dubious smile.] A real castle in the air?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes. One with a firm foundation under it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RAGNAR BROVIK comes out from the house.  He is carrying a\r\n  large green wreath with flowers and silk ribbons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With an outburst of pleasure.] The wreath! Oh, that will be glorious!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In surprise.] Have you brought the wreath Ragnar?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nI promised the foreman I would.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Relieved.] Ah, then I suppose you father is better?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWas he not cheered by what I wrote?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nIt came too late.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nToo late!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nWhen she came with it he was unconscious. He had had a stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, you must go home to him! You must attend to your father!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nHe does not need me any more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut surely you ought to be with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nShe is sitting by his bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Rather uncertainly.] Kaia?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Looking darkly at him.] Yes--Kaia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nGo home, Ragnar--both to him and to her. Give me the wreath.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Suppresses a mocking smile.] You don\'t mean that you yourself--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI will take it down to them myself [Takes the wreath from him.] And now\r\nyou go home; we don\'t require you to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nI know you do not require me any more; but to-day I shall remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, remain then, since you are bent upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[At the railing.] Mr. Solness, I will stand here and look on at you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAt me!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt will be fearfully thrilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[In a low tone.] We will talk about that presently, Hilda.\r\n\r\n     [He goes down the flight of steps with the wreath, and away\r\n       through the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks after him, then turns to RAGNAR.] I think you might at least have\r\nthanked him\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nThanked him? Ought I to have thanked him?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, of course you ought!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nI think it is rather you I ought to thank.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHow can you say such a thing?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Without answering her.] But I advise you to take care, Miss Wangel! For\r\nyou don\'t know him rightly yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Ardently.] Oh, no one knows him as I do!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Laughs in exasperation.] Thank him, when he has held me down year\r\nafter year! When he made father disbelieve in me--made me disbelieve in\r\nmyself! And all merely that he might--!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[As if divining something.] That he might--? Tell me at once!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nThat he might keep her with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With a start towards him.] The girl at the desk.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Threateningly, clenching her hands.] That is not true! You are telling\r\nfalsehoods about him!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nI would not believe it either until to-day--when she said so herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[As if beside herself.] What did she say? I will know! At once! at once!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nShe said that he had taken possession of her mind--her whole\r\nmind--centred all her thoughts upon himself alone. She says that she can\r\nnever leave him--that she will remain here, where he is--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With flashing eyes.] She will not be allowed to!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[As if feeling his way.] Who will not allow her?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Rapidly.] He will not either!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nOh no--I understand the whole thing now. After this, she would merely\r\nbe--in the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou understand nothing--since you can talk like that! No, _I_ will tell\r\nyou why he kept hold of her.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nWell then, why?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep hold of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nHas he told you so?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nNo, but it is so. It must be so! [Wildly.] I will--I will have it so!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nAnd at the very moment when you came--he let her go.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIt was you--you that he let go! What do you suppose he cares about\r\nstrange women like her?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Reflects.] Is it possible that all this time he has been afraid of me?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHe afraid! I would not be so conceited if I were you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nOh, he must have seen long ago that I had something in me, too.\r\nBesides--cowardly--that is just what he is, you see.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHe! Oh yes, I am likely to believe that!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense he is cowardly--he, the great master builder. He is\r\nnot afraid of robbing others of their happiness--as he has done both\r\nfor my father and me. But when it comes to climbing up a paltry bit of\r\nscaffolding--he will do anything rather than that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, you should just have seen him high, high up--at the dizzy height\r\nwhere I once saw him.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nDid you see that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed I did. How free and great he looked as he stood and fastened\r\nthe wreath to the church vane!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nI know that he ventured that, once in his life--one solitary time. It is\r\na legend among us younger men. But no power on earth would induce him to\r\ndo it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nTo-day he will do it again!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Scornfully.] Yes, I daresay!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWe shall see it!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nThat neither you nor I will see.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With uncontrollable vehemence.] I will se it! I will and I must see it!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nBut he will not do it. He simply dare not do it. For you see he cannot\r\nget over this infirmity--master builder though he be.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MRS. SOLNESS comes from the house on to the verandah.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks around.] Is he not here? Where has he gone to?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nMr. Solness is down with the men.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHe took the wreath with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Terrified.] Took the wreath with him! Oh God! oh God! Brovik--you must\r\ngo down to him! Get him to come back here!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nShall I say you want to speak to him, Mrs. Solness?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes, do!--No, no--don\'t say that _I_ want anything! You can say that\r\nsomebody is here, and that he must come at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nGood. I will do so, Mrs. Solness.\r\n\r\n     [He goes down the flight of steps and away through the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, Miss Wangel, you can\'t think how anxious I feel about him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIs there anything in this to be terribly frightened about?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh yes; surely you can understand. Just think, if he were really to do\r\nit! If he should take it into his head to climb up the scaffolding!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Eagerly.] Do you think he will?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, one can never tell what he might take into his head. I am afraid\r\nthere is nothing he mightn\'t think of doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAha! Perhaps you too think he is--well--?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, I don\'t know what to think about him now. The doctor has been\r\ntelling me all sorts of things; and putting it all together with several\r\nthings I have heard him say--\r\n\r\n\r\n  DR. HERDAL looks out, at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nIs he not coming soon?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I think so. I have sent for him at any rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Advancing.] I am afraid you will have to go in, my dear lady--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh no! Oh no! I shall stay out here and wait for Halvard.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nBut some ladies have just come to call on you--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nGood heavens, that too! And just at this moment!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThey say they positively must see the ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, well, I suppose I must go to them after all. It is my duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nCan\'t you ask the ladies to go away?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, that would never do. Now that they are here, it is my duty to see\r\nthem. But do you stay out here in the meantime--and receive him when he\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nAnd try to occupy his attention as long as possible--\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, do, dear Miss Wangel. Keep as firm hold of him as ever you can.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWould it not be best for you to do that?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes; God knows that is my duty. But when one has duties in so many\r\ndirections--\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Looks towards the garden.] There he is coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd I have to go in!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[To HILDA.] Don\'t say anything about my being here.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh no! I daresay I shall find something else to talk to Mr. Solness\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd be sure you keep firm hold of him. I believe you can do it best.\r\n\r\n     [MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL go into the house.  HILDA remains\r\n       standing on the verandah.  SOLNESS comes from the garden, up\r\n       the flight of steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSomebody wants me, I hear.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes; it is I, Mr. Solness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, is it you, Hilda? I was afraid it might be Aline or the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou are very easily frightened, it seems!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nDo you think so?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes; people say that you are afraid to climb about--on the scaffoldings,\r\nyou know.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, that is quite a special thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen it is true that you are afraid to do it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, I am.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAfraid of falling down and killing yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNo, not of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOf what, then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI am afraid of retribution, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOf retribution? [Shakes her head.] I don\'t understand that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nSit down, and I will tell you something.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, do! At once!\r\n\r\n     [She sits on a stool by the railing, and looks expectantly\r\n       at him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Throws his hat on the table.] You know that I began by building\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Nods.] I know that well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFor, you see, I came as a boy from a pious home in the country; and so\r\nit seemed to me that this church-building was the noblest task I could\r\nset myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd I venture to say that I built those poor little churches with such\r\nhonest and warm and heartfelt devotion that--that--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThat--? Well?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWell, that I think that he ought to have been pleased with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHe? What he?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nHe who was to have the churches, of course! He to whose honour and glory\r\nthey were dedicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, indeed! But are you certain, then, that--that he was not--pleased\r\nwith you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Scornfully.] He pleased with me! How can you talk so, Hilda? He who\r\ngave the troll in me leave to lord it just as it pleased. He who bade\r\nthem be at hand to serve me, both day and might--all these--all these--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDevils--\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, of both kinds. Oh no, he made me feel clearly enough that he was not\r\npleased with me. [Mysteriously.] You see, that was really the reason why\r\nhe made the old house burn down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWas that why?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, don\'t you understand? He wanted to give me the chance of becoming\r\nan accomplished master in my own sphere--so that I might build all the\r\nmore glorious churches for him. At first I did not understand what he\r\nwas driving at; but all of a sudden it flashed upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhen was that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nIt was when I was building the church-tower up at Lysanger.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI thought so.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFor you see, Hilda--up there, amidst those new surroundings, I used to\r\ngo about musing and pondering within myself. Then I saw plainly why he\r\nhad taken my little children from me. It was that I should have nothing\r\nelse to attach myself to. No such thing as love and happiness, you\r\nunderstand. I was to be only a master builder--nothing else, and all my\r\nlife long I was to go on building for him. [Laughs.] But I can tell you\r\nnothing came of that!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat did you do then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I searched and tried my own heart--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd then?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe I did the impossible--I, no less than he.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThe impossible?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI had never before been able to climb up to a great, free height. But\r\nthat day I did it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Leaping up.] Yes, yes, you did!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd when I stood there, high over everything, and was hanging the wreath\r\nover the vane, I said to him: Hear me now, thou Mighty One! From this\r\nday forward I will be a free builder--I too, in my sphere--just as thou\r\nin thine. I will never more build churches for thee--only homes for\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With great sparkling eyes.] That was the song that I heard through the\r\nair!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nBut afterwards his turn came.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks despondently at her.] Building homes for human beings--is not\r\nworth a rap, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nDo you say that now?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, for now I see it. Men have no use for these homes of theirs--to be\r\nhappy in. And I should not have had any use for such a home, if I had\r\nhad one. [With a quiet, bitter laugh.] See, that is the upshot of\r\nthe whole affair, however far back I look. Nothing really built; nor\r\nanything sacrificed for the chance of building. Nothing, nothing! the\r\nwhole is nothing!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen you will never build anything more?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[With animation.] On the contrary, I am just going to begin!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat, then? What will you build? Tell me at once!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI believe there is only one possible dwelling-place for human\r\nhappiness--and that is what I am going to build now.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Looks fixedly at him.] Mr. Solness--you mean our castles in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThe castles in the air--yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nI am afraid you would turn dizzy before we got half-way up.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nNot if I can mount hand in hand with you, Hilda.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With an expression of suppressed resentment.] Only with me? Will there\r\nbe no others of the party?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nWho else should there be?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh--that girl--that Kaia at the desk. Poor thing--don\'t you want to take\r\nher with you too?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOho! Was it about her that Aline was talking to you?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nIs it so--or is it not?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Vehemently.] I will not answer such a question. You must believe in me,\r\nwholly and entirely!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAll these ten years I have believed in you so utterly--so utterly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYou must go on believing in me!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen let me see you stand free and high up!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Sadly.] Oh Hilda--it is not every day that I can do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Passionately.] I will have you do it! I will have it! [Imploringly.]\r\nJust once more, Mr. Solness! Do the impossible once again!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Stands and looks deep into her eyes.] If I try it, Hilda, I will stand\r\nup there and talk to him as I did that time before.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[In rising excitement.] What will you say to him?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nI will say to him: Hear me, Mighty Lord--thou may\'st judge me as seems\r\nbest to thee. But hereafter I will build nothing but the loveliest thing\r\nin the world--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Carried away.] Yes--yes--yes!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS. --build it together with a princess, whom I love--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, tell him that! Tell him that!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes. And then I will say to him: Now I shall go down and throw my arms\r\nround her and kiss her--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA. --many times! Say that!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS. --many, many times, I will say it!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nAnd then--?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThen I will wave my hat--and come down to the earth--and do as I said to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[With outstretched arms.] Now I see you again as I did when there was\r\nsong in the air!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Looks at here with his head bowed.] How have you become what you are,\r\nHilda?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHow have you made me what I am?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Shortly and firmly.] The princess shall have her castle.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Jubilant, clapping her hands.] Oh, Mr. Solness--! My lovely, lovely\r\ncastle. Our castle in the air!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOn a firm foundation.\r\n\r\n     [In the street a crowd of people has assembled, vaguely seen\r\n       through the trees.  Music of wind-instruments is heard far\r\n       away behind the new house.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MRS. SOLNESS, with a fur collar round her neck, DOCTOR HERDAL\r\n  with her white shawl on his arm, and some ladies, come out\r\n  on the verandah.  RAGNAR BROVIK comes at the same time up\r\n  from the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[To RAGNAR.] Are we to have music, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nYes. It\'s the band of the Mason\'s Union. [To SOLNESS.] The foreman asked\r\nme to tell you that he is ready now to go up with the wreath.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Takes his hat.] Good. I will go down to him myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Anxiously.] What have you to do down there, Halvard?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Curtly.] I must be down below with the men.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nYes, down below--only down below.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLNESS.\r\n\r\nThat is where I always stand--on everyday occasions.\r\n\r\n     [He goes down the flight of steps and away through the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Calls after him over the railing.] But do beg the man to be careful\r\nwhen he goes up! Promise me that, Halvard!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[To MRS. SOLNESS.] Don\'t you see that I was right? He has given up all\r\nthought of that folly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, what a relief! Twice workmen have fallen, and each time they were\r\nkilled on the spot. [Turns to HILDA.] Thank you, Miss Wangel, for having\r\nkept such a firm hold upon him. I should never have been able to manage\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Playfully.] Yes, yes, Miss Wangel, you know how to keep firm hold on a\r\nman, when you give your mind to it.\r\n\r\n     [MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL go up to the ladies, who are\r\n       standing nearer to the steps and looking over the garden.\r\n       HILDA remains standing beside the railing in the foreground.\r\n       RAGNAR goes up to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[With suppressed laughter, half whispering.] Miss Wangel--do you see all\r\nthose young fellows down in the street?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nThey are my fellow students, come to look at the master.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nWhat do they want to look at him for?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nThey want to see how he daren\'t climb to the top of his own house.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nOh, that is what those boys want, is it?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Spitefully and scornfully.] He has kept us down so long--now we are\r\ngoing to see him keep quietly down below himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYou will not see that--not this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Smiles.] Indeed! Then where shall we see him?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHigh--high up by the vane! That is where you will see him!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Laughs.] Him! Oh yes, I daresay!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHis will is to reach the top--so at the top you shall see him.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nHis will, yes; that I can easily believe. But he simply cannot do it.\r\nHis head would swim round, long, long before he got half-way. He would\r\nhave to crawl down again on his hands and knees.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Points across.] Look! There goes the foreman up the ladders.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nAnd of course he has the wreath to carry too. Oh, I do hope he will be\r\ncareful!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Stares incredulously and shouts.] Why, but it\'s--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Breaking out in jubilation.] It is the master builder himself?\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Screams with terror.] Yes, it is Halvard! Oh my great God--! Halvard!\r\nHalvard!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nHush! Don\'t shout to him!\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\n[Half beside herself.] I must go to him! I must get him to come down\r\nagain!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\n[Holds her.] Don\'t move, any of you! Not a sound!\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Immovable, follows SOLNESS with her eyes.] He climbs and climbs. Higher\r\nand higher! Higher and higher! Look! Just look!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Breathless.] He must turn now. He can\'t possibly help it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nHe climbs and climbs. He will soon be at the top now.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS.\r\n\r\nOh, I shall die of terror. I cannot bear to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nThen don\'t look up at him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThere he is standing on the topmost planks! Right at the top!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nNobody must move! Do you dear?\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Exulting, with quiet intensity.] At last! At last! Now I see him great\r\nand free again!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Almost voiceless.] But this is im--\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nSo I have seen him all through these ten years. How secure he stands!\r\nFrightfully thrilling all the same. Look at him! Now he is hanging the\r\nwreath round the vane!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nI feel as if I were looking at something utterly impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, it is the impossible that he is doing now! [With the indefinable\r\nexpression in her eyes.] Can you see any one else up there with him?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nThere is no one else.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nYes, there is one he is striving with.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nYou are mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\nThen do you hear no song in the air, either?\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nIt must be the wind in the tree-tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n_I_ hear a song--a mighty song! [Shouts in wild jubilation and glee.]\r\nLook, look! Now he is waving his hat! He is waving it to us down here!\r\nOh, wave, wave back to him! For now it is finished! [Snatches the white\r\nshawl from the Doctor, waves it, and shouts up to SOLNESS.] Hurrah for\r\nMaster Builder Solness!\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HERDAL.\r\n\r\nStop! Stop! For God\'s sake--!\r\n\r\n     [The ladies on the verandah wave their pocket-handkerchiefs, and\r\n       the shouts of "Hurrah" are taken up in the street.  Then they\r\n       are suddenly silenced, and the crowd bursts out into a shriek\r\n       of horror.  A human body, with planks and fragments of wood,\r\n       is vaguely perceived crashing down behind the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SOLNESS AND THE LADIES.\r\n\r\n[At the same time.] He is falling! He is falling!\r\n\r\n     [MRS. SOLNESS totters, falls backwards, swooning, and is caught,\r\n       amid cries and confusion, by the ladies.  The crowd in the\r\n       street breaks down the fence and storms into the garden.  At\r\n       the same time DR. HERDAL, too, rushes down thither.  A short\r\n       pause.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Stares fixedly upwards and says, as if petrified.] My Master Builder.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Supports himself, trembling, against the railing.] He must be dashed to\r\npieces--killed on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THE LADIES.\r\n\r\n[Whilst MRS. SOLNESS is carried into the house.] Run down for the\r\ndoctor--\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nI can\'t stir a root--\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER LADY.\r\n\r\nThen call to some one!\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\n[Tries to call out.] How is it? Is he alive?\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOICE.\r\n\r\n[Below, in the garden.] Mr. Solness is dead!\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER VOICES.\r\n\r\n[Nearer.] The head is all crushed.--he fell right into the quarry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[Turns to RAGNAR, and says quietly.] I can\'t see him up there now.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGNAR.\r\n\r\nThis is terrible. So, after all, he could not do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDA.\r\n\r\n[As if in quiet spell-bound triumph.] But he mounted right to the top.\r\nAnd I heard harps in the air. [Waves her shawl in the air, and shrieks\r\nwith wild intensity.] My--my Master Builder!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Master Builder, by Henrik Ibsen\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MASTER BUILDER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 4070.txt or 4070.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/0/7/4070/\r\n\r\nProduced by Douglas E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
