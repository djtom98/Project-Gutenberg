Gripped by these stories and sketches of\r\nSherwood Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s small-town \xe2\x80\x9cgrotesques,\xe2\x80\x9d I felt that he was opening\r\nfor me new depths of experience, touching upon half-buried truths which\r\nnothing in my young life had prepared me for. A New York City boy who\r\nnever saw the crops grow or spent time in the small towns that lay\r\nsprinkled across America, I found myself overwhelmed by the scenes of\r\nwasted life, wasted love\xe2\x80\x94was this the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d America?\xe2\x80\x94that Anderson\r\nsketched in Winesburg. In those days only one other book seemed to\r\noffer so powerful a revelation, and that was Thomas Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s Jude the\r\nObscure.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later, as I was about to go overseas as a soldier, I\r\nspent my last week-end pass on a somewhat quixotic journey to Clyde,\r\nOhio, the town upon which Winesburg was partly modeled. Clyde looked, I\r\nsuppose, not very different from most other American towns, and the few\r\nof its residents I tried to engage in talk about Anderson seemed quite\r\nuninterested. This indifference would not have surprised him; it\r\ncertainly should not surprise anyone who reads his book.\r\n\r\nOnce freed from the army, I started to write literary criticism, and in\r\n1951 I published a critical biography of Anderson. It came shortly\r\nafter Lionel Trilling\xe2\x80\x99s influential essay attacking Anderson, an attack\r\nfrom which Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s reputation would never quite recover. Trilling\r\ncharged Anderson with indulging a vaporous sentimentalism, a kind of\r\nvague emotional meandering in stories that lacked social or spiritual\r\nsolidity. There was a certain cogency in Trilling\xe2\x80\x99s attack, at least\r\nwith regard to Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s inferior work, most of which he wrote after\r\nWinesburg, Ohio. In my book I tried, somewhat awkwardly, to bring\r\ntogether the kinds of judgment Trilling had made with my still keen\r\naffection for the best of Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s writings. By then, I had read\r\nwriters more complex, perhaps more distinguished than Anderson, but his\r\nmuted stories kept a firm place in my memories, and the book I wrote\r\nmight be seen as a gesture of thanks for the light\xe2\x80\x94a glow of darkness,\r\nyou might say\xe2\x80\x94that he had brought to me.\r\n\r\nDecades passed. I no longer read Anderson, perhaps fearing I might have\r\nto surrender an admiration of youth. (There are some writers one should\r\nnever return to.) But now, in the fullness of age, when asked to say a\r\nfew introductory words about Anderson and his work, I have again fallen\r\nunder the spell of Winesburg, Ohio, again responded to the half-spoken\r\ndesires, the flickers of longing that spot its pages. Naturally, I now\r\nhave some changes of response: a few of the stories no longer haunt me\r\nas once they did, but the long story \xe2\x80\x9cGodliness,\xe2\x80\x9d which years ago I\r\nconsidered a failure, I now see as a quaintly effective account of the\r\nway religious fanaticism and material acquisitiveness can become\r\nintertwined in American experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSherwood Anderson was born in Ohio in 1876. His childhood and youth in\r\nClyde, a town with perhaps three thousand souls, were scarred by bouts\r\nof poverty, but he also knew some of the pleasures of pre-industrial\r\nAmerican society. The country was then experiencing what he would later\r\ncall \xe2\x80\x9ca sudden and almost universal turning of men from the old\r\nhandicrafts towards our modern life of machines.\xe2\x80\x9d There were still\r\npeople in Clyde who remembered the frontier, and like America itself,\r\nthe town lived by a mixture of diluted Calvinism and a strong belief in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprogress,\xe2\x80\x9d Young Sherwood, known as \xe2\x80\x9cJobby\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the boy always ready to\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94showed the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that Clyde respected:\r\nfolks expected him to become a \xe2\x80\x9cgo-getter,\xe2\x80\x9d And for a time he did.\r\nMoving to Chicago in his early twenties, he worked in an advertising\r\nagency where he proved adept at turning out copy. \xe2\x80\x9cI create nothing, I\r\nboost, I boost,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about himself, even as, on the side, he was\r\ntrying to write short stories.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 Anderson married and three years later moved to Elyria, a town\r\nforty miles west of Cleveland, where he established a firm that sold\r\npaint. \xe2\x80\x9cI was going to be a rich man\xe2\x80\xa6. Next year a bigger house; and\r\nafter that, presumably, a country estate.\xe2\x80\x9d Later he would say about his\r\nyears in Elyria, \xe2\x80\x9cI was a good deal of a Babbitt, but never completely\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d Something drove him to write, perhaps one of those shapeless\r\nhungers\xe2\x80\x94a need for self-expression? a wish to find a more authentic\r\nkind of experience?\xe2\x80\x94that would become a recurrent motif in his fiction.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in 1912, occurred the great turning point in Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\nPlainly put, he suffered a nervous breakdown, though in his memoirs he\r\nwould elevate this into a moment of liberation in which he abandoned\r\nthe sterility of commerce and turned to the rewards of literature. Nor\r\nwas this, I believe, merely a deception on Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s part, since the\r\nbreakdown painful as it surely was, did help precipitate a basic change\r\nin his life. At the age of 36, he left behind his business and moved to\r\nChicago, becoming one of the rebellious writers and cultural bohemians\r\nin the group that has since come to be called the \xe2\x80\x9cChicago\r\nRenaissance.\xe2\x80\x9d Anderson soon adopted the posture of a free, liberated\r\nspirit, and like many writers of the time, he presented himself as a\r\nsardonic critic of American provincialism and materialism. It was in\r\nthe freedom of the city, in its readiness to put up with deviant styles\r\nof life, that Anderson found the strength to settle accounts with\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nalso to release his affection for\xe2\x80\x94the world of small-town America. The\r\ndream of an unconditional personal freedom, that hazy American version\r\nof utopia, would remain central throughout Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s life and work. It\r\nwas an inspiration; it was a delusion.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 and 1917 Anderson published two novels mostly written in\r\nElyria, Windy McPherson\xe2\x80\x99s Son and Marching Men, both by now largely\r\nforgotten. They show patches of talent but also a crudity of thought\r\nand unsteadiness of language. No one reading these novels was likely to\r\nsuppose that its author could soon produce anything as remarkable as\r\nWinesburg, Ohio. Occasionally there occurs in a writer\xe2\x80\x99s career a\r\nsudden, almost mysterious leap of talent, beyond explanation, perhaps\r\nbeyond any need for explanation.\r\n\r\nIn 1915-16 Anderson had begun to write and in 1919 he published the\r\nstories that comprise Winesburg, Ohio, stories that form, in sum, a\r\nsort of loosely-strung episodic novel. The book was an immediate\r\ncritical success, and soon Anderson was being ranked as a significant\r\nliterary figure. In 1921 the distinguished literary magazine The Dial\r\nawarded him its first annual literary prize of $2,000, the significance\r\nof which is perhaps best understood if one also knows that the second\r\nrecipient was T. S. Eliot. But Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s moment of glory was brief, no\r\nmore than a decade, and sadly, the remaining years until his death in\r\n1940 were marked by a sharp decline in his literary standing. Somehow,\r\nexcept for an occasional story like the haunting \xe2\x80\x9cDeath in the Woods,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe was unable to repeat or surpass his early success. Still, about\r\nWinesburg, Ohio and a small number of stories like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Egg\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nMan Who Became a Woman\xe2\x80\x9d there has rarely been any critical doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Winesburg, Ohio make its appearance than a number of\r\ncritical labels were fixed on it: the revolt against the village, the\r\nespousal of sexual freedom, the deepening of American realism. Such\r\ntags may once have had their point, but by now they seem dated and\r\nstale. The revolt against the village (about which Anderson was always\r\nambivalent) has faded into history. The espousal of sexual freedom\r\nwould soon be exceeded in boldness by other writers. And as for the\r\neffort to place Winesburg, Ohio in a tradition of American realism,\r\nthat now seems dubious. Only rarely is the object of Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s stories\r\nsocial verisimilitude, or the \xe2\x80\x9cphotographing\xe2\x80\x9d of familiar appearances,\r\nin the sense, say, that one might use to describe a novel by Theodore\r\nDreiser or Sinclair Lewis. Only occasionally, and then with a very\r\nlight touch, does Anderson try to fill out the social arrangements of\r\nhis imaginary town\xe2\x80\x94although the fact that his stories are set in a\r\nmid-American place like Winesburg does constitute an important\r\nformative condition. You might even say, with only slight\r\noverstatement, that what Anderson is doing in Winesburg, Ohio could be\r\ndescribed as \xe2\x80\x9cantirealistic,\xe2\x80\x9d fictions notable less for precise locale\r\nand social detail than for a highly personal, even strange vision of\r\nAmerican life. Narrow, intense, almost claustrophobic, the result is a\r\nbook about extreme states of being, the collapse of men and women who\r\nhave lost their psychic bearings and now hover, at best tolerated, at\r\nthe edge of the little community in which they live. It would be a\r\ngross mistake, though not one likely to occur by now, if we were to\r\ntake Winesburg, Ohio as a social photograph of \xe2\x80\x9cthe typical small town\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(whatever that might be.) Anderson evokes a depressed landscape in\r\nwhich lost souls wander about; they make their flitting appearances\r\nmostly in the darkness of night, these stumps and shades of humanity.\r\nThis vision has its truth, and at its best it is a terrible if narrow\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94but it is itself also grotesque, with the tone of the authorial\r\nvoice and the mode of composition forming muted signals of the book\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontent. Figures like Dr. Parcival, Kate Swift, and Wash Williams are\r\nnot, nor are they meant to be, \xe2\x80\x9cfully-rounded\xe2\x80\x9d characters such as we\r\ncan expect in realistic fiction; they are the shards of life, glimpsed\r\nfor a moment, the debris of suffering and defeat. In each story one of\r\nthem emerges, shyly or with a false assertiveness, trying to reach out\r\nto companionship and love, driven almost mad by the search for human\r\nconnection. In the economy of Winesburg these grotesques matter less in\r\ntheir own right than as agents or symptoms of that \xe2\x80\x9cindefinable hunger\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor meaning which is Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s preoccupation.\r\n\r\nBrushing against one another, passing one another in the streets or the\r\nfields, they see bodies and hear voices, but it does not really\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94they are disconnected, psychically lost. Is this due to the\r\nparticular circumstances of small-town America as Anderson saw it at\r\nthe turn of the century? Or does he feel that he is sketching an\r\ninescapable human condition which makes all of us bear the burden of\r\nloneliness? Alice Hindman in the story \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure\xe2\x80\x9d turns her face to\r\nthe wall and tries \xe2\x80\x9cto force herself to face the fact that many people\r\nmust live and die alone, even in Winesburg.\xe2\x80\x9d Or especially in\r\nWinesburg? Such impressions have been put in more general terms in\r\nAnderson\xe2\x80\x99s only successful novel, Poor White:\r\n\r\nAll men lead their lives behind a wall of misunderstanding they have\r\nthemselves built, and most men die in silence and unnoticed behind the\r\nwalls. Now and then a man, cut off from his fellows by the\r\npeculiarities of his nature, becomes absorbed in doing something that\r\nis personal, useful and beautiful. Word of his activities is carried\r\nover the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese \xe2\x80\x9cwalls\xe2\x80\x9d of misunderstanding are only seldom due to physical\r\ndeformities (Wing Biddlebaum in \xe2\x80\x9cHands\xe2\x80\x9d) or oppressive social\r\narrangements (Kate Swift in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Teacher.\xe2\x80\x9d) Misunderstanding,\r\nloneliness, the inability to articulate, are all seen by Anderson as\r\nvirtually a root condition, something deeply set in our natures. Nor\r\nare these people, the grotesques, simply to be pitied and dismissed; at\r\nsome point in their lives they have known desire, have dreamt of\r\nambition, have hoped for friendship. In all of them there was once\r\nsomething sweet, \xe2\x80\x9clike the twisted little apples that grow in the\r\norchards in Winesburg.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, broken and adrift, they clutch at some\r\nrigid notion or idea, a \xe2\x80\x9ctruth\xe2\x80\x9d which turns out to bear the stamp of\r\nmonomania, leaving them helplessly sputtering, desperate to speak out\r\nbut unable to. Winesburg, Ohio registers the losses inescapable to\r\nlife, and it does so with a deep fraternal sadness, a sympathy casting\r\na mild glow over the entire book. \xe2\x80\x9cWords,\xe2\x80\x9d as the American writer Paula\r\nFox has said, \xe2\x80\x9care nets through which all truth escapes.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet what do\r\nwe have but words?\r\n\r\nThey want, these Winesburg grotesques, to unpack their hearts, to\r\nrelease emotions buried and festering. Wash Williams tries to explain\r\nhis eccentricity but hardly can; Louise Bentley \xe2\x80\x9ctried to talk but\r\ncould say nothing\xe2\x80\x9d; Enoch Robinson retreats to a fantasy world,\r\ninventing \xe2\x80\x9chis own people to whom he could really talk and to whom he\r\nexplained the things he had been unable to explain to living people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his own somber way, Anderson has here touched upon one of the great\r\nthemes of American literature, especially Midwestern literature, in the\r\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: the struggle for speech\r\nas it entails a search for the self. Perhaps the central Winesburg\r\nstory, tracing the basic movements of the book, is \xe2\x80\x9cPaper Pills,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nwhich the old Doctor Reefy sits \xe2\x80\x9cin his empty office close by a window\r\nthat was covered with cobwebs,\xe2\x80\x9d writes down some thoughts on slips of\r\npaper (\xe2\x80\x9cpyramids of truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he calls them) and then stuffs them into\r\nhis pockets where they \xe2\x80\x9cbecome round hard balls\xe2\x80\x9d soon to be discarded.\r\nWhat Dr. Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctruths\xe2\x80\x9d may be we never know; Anderson simply\r\npersuades us that to this lonely old man they are utterly precious and\r\nthereby incommunicable, forming a kind of blurred moral signature.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the attentive reader will notice in these stories a\r\nrecurrent pattern of theme and incident: the grotesques, gathering up a\r\nlittle courage, venture out into the streets of Winesburg, often in the\r\ndark, there to establish some initiatory relationship with George\r\nWillard, the young reporter who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet lived long enough to become\r\na grotesque. Hesitantly, fearfully, or with a sputtering incoherent\r\nrage, they approach him, pleading that he listen to their stories in\r\nthe hope that perhaps they can find some sort of renewal in his\r\nyouthful voice. Upon this sensitive and fragile boy they pour out their\r\ndesires and frustrations. Dr. Parcival hopes that George Willard \xe2\x80\x9cwill\r\nwrite the book I may never get written,\xe2\x80\x9d and for Enoch Robinson, the\r\nboy represents \xe2\x80\x9cthe youthful sadness, young man\xe2\x80\x99s sadness, the sadness\r\nof a growing boy in a village at the year\xe2\x80\x99s end [which may open] the\r\nlips of the old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat the grotesques really need is each other, but their estrangement\r\nis so extreme they cannot establish direct ties\xe2\x80\x94they can only hope for\r\nconnection through George Willard. The burden this places on the boy is\r\nmore than he can bear. He listens to them attentively, he is\r\nsympathetic to their complaints, but finally he is too absorbed in his\r\nown dreams. The grotesques turn to him because he seems\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94younger, more open, not yet hardened\xe2\x80\x94but it is precisely\r\nthis \xe2\x80\x9cdifference\xe2\x80\x9d that keeps him from responding as warmly as they\r\nwant. It is hardly the boy\xe2\x80\x99s fault; it is simply in the nature of\r\nthings. For George Willard, the grotesques form a moment in his\r\neducation; for the grotesques, their encounters with George Willard\r\ncome to seem like a stamp of hopelessness.\r\n\r\nThe prose Anderson employs in telling these stories may seem at first\r\nglance to be simple: short sentences, a sparse vocabulary,\r\nuncomplicated syntax. In actuality, Anderson developed an artful style\r\nin which, following Mark Twain and preceding Ernest Hemingway, he tried\r\nto use American speech as the base of a tensed rhythmic prose that has\r\nan economy and a shapeliness seldom found in ordinary speech or even\r\noral narration. What Anderson employs here is a stylized version of the\r\nAmerican language, sometimes rising to quite formal rhetorical patterns\r\nand sometimes sinking to a self-conscious mannerism. But at its best,\r\nAnderson\xe2\x80\x99s prose style in Winesburg, Ohio is a supple instrument,\r\nyielding that \xe2\x80\x9clow fine music\xe2\x80\x9d which he admired so much in the stories\r\nof Turgenev.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst fates that can befall a writer is that of\r\nself-imitation: the effort later in life, often desperate, to recapture\r\nthe tones and themes of youthful beginnings. Something of the sort\r\nhappened with Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s later writings. Most critics and readers grew\r\nimpatient with the work he did after, say, 1927 or 1928; they felt he\r\nwas constantly repeating his gestures of emotional \xe2\x80\x9cgroping\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what he\r\nhad called in Winesburg, Ohio the \xe2\x80\x9cindefinable hunger\xe2\x80\x9d that prods and\r\ntorments people. It became the critical fashion to see Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgropings\xe2\x80\x9d as a sign of delayed adolescence, a failure to develop as a\r\nwriter. Once he wrote a chilling reply to those who dismissed him in\r\nthis way: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters much, all this calling a man a\r\nmuddler, a groper, etc\xe2\x80\xa6. The very man who throws such words as these\r\nknows in his heart that he is also facing a wall.\xe2\x80\x9d This remark seems to\r\nme both dignified and strong, yet it must be admitted that there was\r\nsome justice in the negative responses to his later work. For what\r\ncharacterized it was not so much \xe2\x80\x9cgroping\xe2\x80\x9d as the imitation of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgroping,\xe2\x80\x9d the self-caricature of a writer who feels driven back upon\r\nan earlier self that is, alas, no longer available.\r\n\r\nBut Winesburg, Ohio remains a vital work, fresh and authentic. Most of\r\nits stories are composed in a minor key, a tone of subdued\r\npathos\xe2\x80\x94pathos marking both the nature and limit of Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s talent.\r\n(He spoke of himself as a \xe2\x80\x9cminor writer.\xe2\x80\x9d) In a few stories, however,\r\nhe was able to reach beyond pathos and to strike a tragic note. The\r\nsingle best story in Winesburg, Ohio is, I think, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Untold Lie,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nwhich the urgency of choice becomes an outer sign of a tragic element\r\nin the human condition. And in Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s single greatest story, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nEgg,\xe2\x80\x9d which appeared a few years after Winesburg, Ohio, he succeeded in\r\nbringing together a surface of farce with an undertone of tragedy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nEgg\xe2\x80\x9d is an American masterpiece.\r\n\r\nAnderson\xe2\x80\x99s influence upon later American writers, especially those who\r\nwrote short stories, has been enormous. Ernest Hemingway and William\r\nFaulkner both praised him as a writer who brought a new tremor of\r\nfeeling, a new sense of introspectiveness to the American short story.\r\nAs Faulkner put it, Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwas the fumbling for exactitude, the\r\nexact word and phrase within the limited scope of a vocabulary\r\ncontrolled and even repressed by what was in him almost a fetish of\r\nsimplicity \xe2\x80\xa6 to seek always to penetrate to thought\xe2\x80\x99s uttermost end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd in many younger writers who may not even be aware of the Anderson\r\ninfluence, you can see touches of his approach, echoes of his voice.\r\n\r\nWriting about the Elizabethan playwright John Ford, the poet Algernon\r\nSwinburne once said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf he touches you once he takes you, and what he\r\ntakes he keeps hold of; his work becomes part of your thought and\r\nparcel of your spiritual furniture forever.\xe2\x80\x9d So it is, for me and many\r\nothers, with Sherwood Anderson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the memory of my mother,\r\nEMMA SMITH ANDERSON,\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose keen observations on the life about her first awoke in me the\r\nhunger to see beneath the surface of lives, this book is dedicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALES AND THE PERSONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE GROTESQUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer, an old man with a white mustache, had some difficulty in\r\ngetting into bed. The windows of the house in which he lived were high\r\nand he wanted to look at the trees when he awoke in the morning. A\r\ncarpenter came to fix the bed so that it would be on a level with the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nQuite a fuss was made about the matter. The carpenter, who had been a\r\nsoldier in the Civil War, came into the writer\xe2\x80\x99s room and sat down to\r\ntalk of building a platform for the purpose of raising the bed. The\r\nwriter had cigars lying about and the carpenter smoked.\r\n\r\nFor a time the two men talked of the raising of the bed and then they\r\ntalked of other things. The soldier got on the subject of the war. The\r\nwriter, in fact, led him to that subject. The carpenter had once been a\r\nprisoner in Andersonville prison and had lost a brother. The brother\r\nhad died of starvation, and whenever the carpenter got upon that\r\nsubject he cried. He, like the old writer, had a white mustache, and\r\nwhen he cried he puckered up his lips and the mustache bobbed up and\r\ndown. The weeping old man with the cigar in his mouth was ludicrous.\r\nThe plan the writer had for the raising of his bed was forgotten and\r\nlater the carpenter did it in his own way and the writer, who was past\r\nsixty, had to help himself with a chair when he went to bed at night.\r\n\r\nIn his bed the writer rolled over on his side and lay quite still. For\r\nyears he had been beset with notions concerning his heart. He was a\r\nhard smoker and his heart fluttered. The idea had got into his mind\r\nthat he would some time die unexpectedly and always when he got into\r\nbed he thought of that. It did not alarm him. The effect in fact was\r\nquite a special thing and not easily explained. It made him more alive,\r\nthere in bed, than at any other time. Perfectly still he lay and his\r\nbody was old and not of much use any more, but something inside him was\r\naltogether young. He was like a pregnant woman, only that the thing\r\ninside him was not a baby but a youth. No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a youth, it was a\r\nwoman, young, and wearing a coat of mail like a knight. It is absurd,\r\nyou see, to try to tell what was inside the old writer as he lay on his\r\nhigh bed and listened to the fluttering of his heart. The thing to get\r\nat is what the writer, or the young thing within the writer, was\r\nthinking about.\r\n\r\nThe old writer, like all of the people in the world, had got, during\r\nhis long life, a great many notions in his head. He had once been quite\r\nhandsome and a number of women had been in love with him. And then, of\r\ncourse, he had known people, many people, known them in a peculiarly\r\nintimate way that was different from the way in which you and I know\r\npeople. At least that is what the writer thought and the thought\r\npleased him. Why quarrel with an old man concerning his thoughts?\r\n\r\nIn the bed the writer had a dream that was not a dream. As he grew\r\nsomewhat sleepy but was still conscious, figures began to appear before\r\nhis eyes. He imagined the young indescribable thing within himself was\r\ndriving a long procession of figures before his eyes.\r\n\r\nYou see the interest in all this lies in the figures that went before\r\nthe eyes of the writer. They were all grotesques. All of the men and\r\nwomen the writer had ever known had become grotesques.\r\n\r\nThe grotesques were not all horrible. Some were amusing, some almost\r\nbeautiful, and one, a woman all drawn out of shape, hurt the old man by\r\nher grotesqueness. When she passed he made a noise like a small dog\r\nwhimpering. Had you come into the room you might have supposed the old\r\nman had unpleasant dreams or perhaps indigestion.\r\n\r\nFor an hour the procession of grotesques passed before the eyes of the\r\nold man, and then, although it was a painful thing to do, he crept out\r\nof bed and began to write. Some one of the grotesques had made a deep\r\nimpression on his mind and he wanted to describe it.\r\n\r\nAt his desk the writer worked for an hour. In the end he wrote a book\r\nwhich he called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Book of the Grotesque.\xe2\x80\x9d It was never published,\r\nbut I saw it once and it made an indelible impression on my mind. The\r\nbook had one central thought that is very strange and has always\r\nremained with me. By remembering it I have been able to understand many\r\npeople and things that I was never able to understand before. The\r\nthought was involved but a simple statement of it would be something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\nThat in the beginning when the world was young there were a great many\r\nthoughts but no such thing as a truth. Man made the truths himself and\r\neach truth was a composite of a great many vague thoughts. All about in\r\nthe world were the truths and they were all beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe old man had listed hundreds of the truths in his book. I will not\r\ntry to tell you of all of them. There was the truth of virginity and\r\nthe truth of passion, the truth of wealth and of poverty, of thrift and\r\nof profligacy, of carelessness and abandon. Hundreds and hundreds were\r\nthe truths and they were all beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnd then the people came along. Each as he appeared snatched up one of\r\nthe truths and some who were quite strong snatched up a dozen of them.\r\n\r\nIt was the truths that made the people grotesques. The old man had\r\nquite an elaborate theory concerning the matter. It was his notion that\r\nthe moment one of the people took one of the truths to himself, called\r\nit his truth, and tried to live his life by it, he became a grotesque\r\nand the truth he embraced became a falsehood.\r\n\r\nYou can see for yourself how the old man, who had spent all of his life\r\nwriting and was filled with words, would write hundreds of pages\r\nconcerning this matter. The subject would become so big in his mind\r\nthat he himself would be in danger of becoming a grotesque. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nI suppose, for the same reason that he never published the book. It was\r\nthe young thing inside him that saved the old man.\r\n\r\nConcerning the old carpenter who fixed the bed for the writer, I only\r\nmentioned him because he, like many of what are called very common\r\npeople, became the nearest thing to what is understandable and lovable\r\nof all the grotesques in the writer\xe2\x80\x99s book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the half decayed veranda of a small frame house that stood near\r\nthe edge of a ravine near the town of Winesburg, Ohio, a fat little old\r\nman walked nervously up and down. Across a long field that had been\r\nseeded for clover but that had produced only a dense crop of yellow\r\nmustard weeds, he could see the public highway along which went a wagon\r\nfilled with berry pickers returning from the fields. The berry pickers,\r\nyouths and maidens, laughed and shouted boisterously. A boy clad in a\r\nblue shirt leaped from the wagon and attempted to drag after him one of\r\nthe maidens, who screamed and protested shrilly. The feet of the boy in\r\nthe road kicked up a cloud of dust that floated across the face of the\r\ndeparting sun. Over the long field came a thin girlish voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\r\nWing Biddlebaum, comb your hair, it\xe2\x80\x99s falling into your eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncommanded the voice to the man, who was bald and whose nervous little\r\nhands fiddled about the bare white forehead as though arranging a mass\r\nof tangled locks.\r\n\r\nWing Biddlebaum, forever frightened and beset by a ghostly band of\r\ndoubts, did not think of himself as in any way a part of the life of\r\nthe town where he had lived for twenty years. Among all the people of\r\nWinesburg but one had come close to him. With George Willard, son of\r\nTom Willard, the proprietor of the New Willard House, he had formed\r\nsomething like a friendship. George Willard was the reporter on the\r\n_Winesburg Eagle_ and sometimes in the evenings he walked out along the\r\nhighway to Wing Biddlebaum\xe2\x80\x99s house. Now as the old man walked up and\r\ndown on the veranda, his hands moving nervously about, he was hoping\r\nthat George Willard would come and spend the evening with him. After\r\nthe wagon containing the berry pickers had passed, he went across the\r\nfield through the tall mustard weeds and climbing a rail fence peered\r\nanxiously along the road to the town. For a moment he stood thus,\r\nrubbing his hands together and looking up and down the road, and then,\r\nfear overcoming him, ran back to walk again upon the porch on his own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of George Willard, Wing Biddlebaum, who for twenty\r\nyears had been the town mystery, lost something of his timidity, and\r\nhis shadowy personality, submerged in a sea of doubts, came forth to\r\nlook at the world. With the young reporter at his side, he ventured in\r\nthe light of day into Main Street or strode up and down on the rickety\r\nfront porch of his own house, talking excitedly. The voice that had\r\nbeen low and trembling became shrill and loud. The bent figure\r\nstraightened. With a kind of wriggle, like a fish returned to the brook\r\nby the fisherman, Biddlebaum the silent began to talk, striving to put\r\ninto words the ideas that had been accumulated by his mind during long\r\nyears of silence.\r\n\r\nWing Biddlebaum talked much with his hands. The slender expressive\r\nfingers, forever active, forever striving to conceal themselves in his\r\npockets or behind his back, came forth and became the piston rods of\r\nhis machinery of expression.\r\n\r\nThe story of Wing Biddlebaum is a story of hands. Their restless\r\nactivity, like unto the beating of the wings of an imprisoned bird, had\r\ngiven him his name. Some obscure poet of the town had thought of it.\r\nThe hands alarmed their owner. He wanted to keep them hidden away and\r\nlooked with amazement at the quiet inexpressive hands of other men who\r\nworked beside him in the fields, or passed, driving sleepy teams on\r\ncountry roads.\r\n\r\nWhen he talked to George Willard, Wing Biddlebaum closed his fists and\r\nbeat with them upon a table or on the walls of his house. The action\r\nmade him more comfortable. If the desire to talk came to him when the\r\ntwo were walking in the fields, he sought out a stump or the top board\r\nof a fence and with his hands pounding busily talked with renewed ease.\r\n\r\nThe story of Wing Biddlebaum\xe2\x80\x99s hands is worth a book in itself.\r\nSympathetically set forth it would tap many strange, beautiful\r\nqualities in obscure men. It is a job for a poet. In Winesburg the\r\nhands had attracted attention merely because of their activity. With\r\nthem Wing Biddlebaum had picked as high as a hundred and forty quarts\r\nof strawberries in a day. They became his distinguishing feature, the\r\nsource of his fame. Also they made more grotesque an already grotesque\r\nand elusive individuality. Winesburg was proud of the hands of Wing\r\nBiddlebaum in the same spirit in which it was proud of Banker White\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnew stone house and Wesley Moyer\xe2\x80\x99s bay stallion, Tony Tip, that had won\r\nthe two-fifteen trot at the fall races in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nAs for George Willard, he had many times wanted to ask about the hands.\r\nAt times an almost overwhelming curiosity had taken hold of him. He\r\nfelt that there must be a reason for their strange activity and their\r\ninclination to keep hidden away and only a growing respect for Wing\r\nBiddlebaum kept him from blurting out the questions that were often in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nOnce he had been on the point of asking. The two were walking in the\r\nfields on a summer afternoon and had stopped to sit upon a grassy bank.\r\nAll afternoon Wing Biddlebaum had talked as one inspired. By a fence he\r\nhad stopped and beating like a giant woodpecker upon the top board had\r\nshouted at George Willard, condemning his tendency to be too much\r\ninfluenced by the people about him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are destroying yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have the inclination to be alone and to dream and you are\r\nafraid of dreams. You want to be like others in town here. You hear\r\nthem talk and you try to imitate them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the grassy bank Wing Biddlebaum had tried again to drive his point\r\nhome. His voice became soft and reminiscent, and with a sigh of\r\ncontentment he launched into a long rambling talk, speaking as one lost\r\nin a dream.\r\n\r\nOut of the dream Wing Biddlebaum made a picture for George Willard. In\r\nthe picture men lived again in a kind of pastoral golden age. Across a\r\ngreen open country came clean-limbed young men, some afoot, some\r\nmounted upon horses. In crowds the young men came to gather about the\r\nfeet of an old man who sat beneath a tree in a tiny garden and who\r\ntalked to them.\r\n\r\nWing Biddlebaum became wholly inspired. For once he forgot the hands.\r\nSlowly they stole forth and lay upon George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.\r\nSomething new and bold came into the voice that talked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must try\r\nto forget all you have learned,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must begin to\r\ndream. From this time on you must shut your ears to the roaring of the\r\nvoices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPausing in his speech, Wing Biddlebaum looked long and earnestly at\r\nGeorge Willard. His eyes glowed. Again he raised the hands to caress\r\nthe boy and then a look of horror swept over his face.\r\n\r\nWith a convulsive movement of his body, Wing Biddlebaum sprang to his\r\nfeet and thrust his hands deep into his trousers pockets. Tears came to\r\nhis eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be getting along home. I can talk no more with you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said nervously.\r\n\r\nWithout looking back, the old man had hurried down the hillside and\r\nacross a meadow, leaving George Willard perplexed and frightened upon\r\nthe grassy slope. With a shiver of dread the boy arose and went along\r\nthe road toward town. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not ask him about his hands,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\r\ntouched by the memory of the terror he had seen in the man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what it is. His\r\nhands have something to do with his fear of me and of everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd George Willard was right. Let us look briefly into the story of the\r\nhands. Perhaps our talking of them will arouse the poet who will tell\r\nthe hidden wonder story of the influence for which the hands were but\r\nfluttering pennants of promise.\r\n\r\nIn his youth Wing Biddlebaum had been a school teacher in a town in\r\nPennsylvania. He was not then known as Wing Biddlebaum, but went by the\r\nless euphonic name of Adolph Myers. As Adolph Myers he was much loved\r\nby the boys of his school.\r\n\r\nAdolph Myers was meant by nature to be a teacher of youth. He was one\r\nof those rare, little-understood men who rule by a power so gentle that\r\nit passes as a lovable weakness. In their feeling for the boys under\r\ntheir charge such men are not unlike the finer sort of women in their\r\nlove of men.\r\n\r\nAnd yet that is but crudely stated. It needs the poet there. With the\r\nboys of his school, Adolph Myers had walked in the evening or had sat\r\ntalking until dusk upon the schoolhouse steps lost in a kind of dream.\r\nHere and there went his hands, caressing the shoulders of the boys,\r\nplaying about the tousled heads. As he talked his voice became soft and\r\nmusical. There was a caress in that also. In a way the voice and the\r\nhands, the stroking of the shoulders and the touching of the hair were\r\na part of the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s effort to carry a dream into the young\r\nminds. By the caress that was in his fingers he expressed himself. He\r\nwas one of those men in whom the force that creates life is diffused,\r\nnot centralized. Under the caress of his hands doubt and disbelief went\r\nout of the minds of the boys and they began also to dream.\r\n\r\nAnd then the tragedy. A half-witted boy of the school became enamored\r\nof the young master. In his bed at night he imagined unspeakable things\r\nand in the morning went forth to tell his dreams as facts. Strange,\r\nhideous accusations fell from his loosehung lips. Through the\r\nPennsylvania town went a shiver. Hidden, shadowy doubts that had been\r\nin men\xe2\x80\x99s minds concerning Adolph Myers were galvanized into beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy did not linger. Trembling lads were jerked out of bed and\r\nquestioned. \xe2\x80\x9cHe put his arms about me,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. \xe2\x80\x9cHis fingers were\r\nalways playing in my hair,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon a man of the town, Henry Bradford, who kept a saloon,\r\ncame to the schoolhouse door. Calling Adolph Myers into the school yard\r\nhe began to beat him with his fists. As his hard knuckles beat down\r\ninto the frightened face of the school-master, his wrath became more\r\nand more terrible. Screaming with dismay, the children ran here and\r\nthere like disturbed insects. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to put your hands on my\r\nboy, you beast,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the saloon keeper, who, tired of beating the\r\nmaster, had begun to kick him about the yard.\r\n\r\nAdolph Myers was driven from the Pennsylvania town in the night. With\r\nlanterns in their hands a dozen men came to the door of the house where\r\nhe lived alone and commanded that he dress and come forth. It was\r\nraining and one of the men had a rope in his hands. They had intended\r\nto hang the school-master, but something in his figure, so small,\r\nwhite, and pitiful, touched their hearts and they let him escape. As he\r\nran away into the darkness they repented of their weakness and ran\r\nafter him, swearing and throwing sticks and great balls of soft mud at\r\nthe figure that screamed and ran faster and faster into the darkness.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Adolph Myers had lived alone in Winesburg. He was but\r\nforty but looked sixty-five. The name of Biddlebaum he got from a box\r\nof goods seen at a freight station as he hurried through an eastern\r\nOhio town. He had an aunt in Winesburg, a black-toothed old woman who\r\nraised chickens, and with her he lived until she died. He had been ill\r\nfor a year after the experience in Pennsylvania, and after his recovery\r\nworked as a day laborer in the fields, going timidly about and striving\r\nto conceal his hands. Although he did not understand what had happened\r\nhe felt that the hands must be to blame. Again and again the fathers of\r\nthe boys had talked of the hands. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hands to yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nsaloon keeper had roared, dancing, with fury in the schoolhouse yard.\r\n\r\nUpon the veranda of his house by the ravine, Wing Biddlebaum continued\r\nto walk up and down until the sun had disappeared and the road beyond\r\nthe field was lost in the grey shadows. Going into his house he cut\r\nslices of bread and spread honey upon them. When the rumble of the\r\nevening train that took away the express cars loaded with the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nharvest of berries had passed and restored the silence of the summer\r\nnight, he went again to walk upon the veranda. In the darkness he could\r\nnot see the hands and they became quiet. Although he still hungered for\r\nthe presence of the boy, who was the medium through which he expressed\r\nhis love of man, the hunger became again a part of his loneliness and\r\nhis waiting. Lighting a lamp, Wing Biddlebaum washed the few dishes\r\nsoiled by his simple meal and, setting up a folding cot by the screen\r\ndoor that led to the porch, prepared to undress for the night. A few\r\nstray white bread crumbs lay on the cleanly washed floor by the table;\r\nputting the lamp upon a low stool he began to pick up the crumbs,\r\ncarrying them to his mouth one by one with unbelievable rapidity. In\r\nthe dense blotch of light beneath the table, the kneeling figure looked\r\nlike a priest engaged in some service of his church. The nervous\r\nexpressive fingers, flashing in and out of the light, might well have\r\nbeen mistaken for the fingers of the devotee going swiftly through\r\ndecade after decade of his rosary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER PILLS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was an old man with a white beard and huge nose and hands. Long\r\nbefore the time during which we will know him, he was a doctor and\r\ndrove a jaded white horse from house to house through the streets of\r\nWinesburg. Later he married a girl who had money. She had been left a\r\nlarge fertile farm when her father died. The girl was quiet, tall, and\r\ndark, and to many people she seemed very beautiful. Everyone in\r\nWinesburg wondered why she married the doctor. Within a year after the\r\nmarriage she died.\r\n\r\nThe knuckles of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hands were extraordinarily large. When the\r\nhands were closed they looked like clusters of unpainted wooden balls\r\nas large as walnuts fastened together by steel rods. He smoked a cob\r\npipe and after his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death sat all day in his empty office close\r\nby a window that was covered with cobwebs. He never opened the window.\r\nOnce on a hot day in August he tried but found it stuck fast and after\r\nthat he forgot all about it.\r\n\r\nWinesburg had forgotten the old man, but in Doctor Reefy there were the\r\nseeds of something very fine. Alone in his musty office in the Heffner\r\nBlock above the Paris Dry Goods Company\xe2\x80\x99s store, he worked ceaselessly,\r\nbuilding up something that he himself destroyed. Little pyramids of\r\ntruth he erected and after erecting knocked them down again that he\r\nmight have the truths to erect other pyramids.\r\n\r\nDoctor Reefy was a tall man who had worn one suit of clothes for ten\r\nyears. It was frayed at the sleeves and little holes had appeared at\r\nthe knees and elbows. In the office he wore also a linen duster with\r\nhuge pockets into which he continually stuffed scraps of paper. After\r\nsome weeks the scraps of paper became little hard round balls, and when\r\nthe pockets were filled he dumped them out upon the floor. For ten\r\nyears he had but one friend, another old man named John Spaniard who\r\nowned a tree nursery. Sometimes, in a playful mood, old Doctor Reefy\r\ntook from his pockets a handful of the paper balls and threw them at\r\nthe nursery man. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is to confound you, you blathering old\r\nsentimentalist,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, shaking with laughter.\r\n\r\nThe story of Doctor Reefy and his courtship of the tall dark girl who\r\nbecame his wife and left her money to him is a very curious story. It\r\nis delicious, like the twisted little apples that grow in the orchards\r\nof Winesburg. In the fall one walks in the orchards and the ground is\r\nhard with frost underfoot. The apples have been taken from the trees by\r\nthe pickers. They have been put in barrels and shipped to the cities\r\nwhere they will be eaten in apartments that are filled with books,\r\nmagazines, furniture, and people. On the trees are only a few gnarled\r\napples that the pickers have rejected. They look like the knuckles of\r\nDoctor Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s hands. One nibbles at them and they are delicious. Into\r\na little round place at the side of the apple has been gathered all of\r\nits sweetness. One runs from tree to tree over the frosted ground\r\npicking the gnarled, twisted apples and filling his pockets with them.\r\nOnly the few know the sweetness of the twisted apples.\r\n\r\nThe girl and Doctor Reefy began their courtship on a summer afternoon.\r\nHe was forty-five then and already he had begun the practice of filling\r\nhis pockets with the scraps of paper that became hard balls and were\r\nthrown away. The habit had been formed as he sat in his buggy behind\r\nthe jaded white horse and went slowly along country roads. On the\r\npapers were written thoughts, ends of thoughts, beginnings of thoughts.\r\n\r\nOne by one the mind of Doctor Reefy had made the thoughts. Out of many\r\nof them he formed a truth that arose gigantic in his mind. The truth\r\nclouded the world. It became terrible and then faded away and the\r\nlittle thoughts began again.\r\n\r\nThe tall dark girl came to see Doctor Reefy because she was in the\r\nfamily way and had become frightened. She was in that condition because\r\nof a series of circumstances also curious.\r\n\r\nThe death of her father and mother and the rich acres of land that had\r\ncome down to her had set a train of suitors on her heels. For two years\r\nshe saw suitors almost every evening. Except two they were all alike.\r\nThey talked to her of passion and there was a strained eager quality in\r\ntheir voices and in their eyes when they looked at her. The two who\r\nwere different were much unlike each other. One of them, a slender\r\nyoung man with white hands, the son of a jeweler in Winesburg, talked\r\ncontinually of virginity. When he was with her he was never off the\r\nsubject. The other, a black-haired boy with large ears, said nothing at\r\nall but always managed to get her into the darkness, where he began to\r\nkiss her.\r\n\r\nFor a time the tall dark girl thought she would marry the jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson. For hours she sat in silence listening as he talked to her and\r\nthen she began to be afraid of something. Beneath his talk of virginity\r\nshe began to think there was a lust greater than in all the others. At\r\ntimes it seemed to her that as he talked he was holding her body in his\r\nhands. She imagined him turning it slowly about in the white hands and\r\nstaring at it. At night she dreamed that he had bitten into her body\r\nand that his jaws were dripping. She had the dream three times, then\r\nshe became in the family way to the one who said nothing at all but who\r\nin the moment of his passion actually did bite her shoulder so that for\r\ndays the marks of his teeth showed.\r\n\r\nAfter the tall dark girl came to know Doctor Reefy it seemed to her\r\nthat she never wanted to leave him again. She went into his office one\r\nmorning and without her saying anything he seemed to know what had\r\nhappened to her.\r\n\r\nIn the office of the doctor there was a woman, the wife of the man who\r\nkept the bookstore in Winesburg. Like all old-fashioned country\r\npractitioners, Doctor Reefy pulled teeth, and the woman who waited held\r\na handkerchief to her teeth and groaned. Her husband was with her and\r\nwhen the tooth was taken out they both screamed and blood ran down on\r\nthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s white dress. The tall dark girl did not pay any attention.\r\nWhen the woman and the man had gone the doctor smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take you\r\ndriving into the country with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks the tall dark girl and the doctor were together\r\nalmost every day. The condition that had brought her to him passed in\r\nan illness, but she was like one who has discovered the sweetness of\r\nthe twisted apples, she could not get her mind fixed again upon the\r\nround perfect fruit that is eaten in the city apartments. In the fall\r\nafter the beginning of her acquaintanceship with him she married Doctor\r\nReefy and in the following spring she died. During the winter he read\r\nto her all of the odds and ends of thoughts he had scribbled on the\r\nbits of paper. After he had read them he laughed and stuffed them away\r\nin his pockets to become round hard balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Willard, the mother of George Willard, was tall and gaunt and\r\nher face was marked with smallpox scars. Although she was but\r\nforty-five, some obscure disease had taken the fire out of her figure.\r\nListlessly she went about the disorderly old hotel looking at the faded\r\nwall-paper and the ragged carpets and, when she was able to be about,\r\ndoing the work of a chambermaid among beds soiled by the slumbers of\r\nfat traveling men. Her husband, Tom Willard, a slender, graceful man\r\nwith square shoulders, a quick military step, and a black mustache\r\ntrained to turn sharply up at the ends, tried to put the wife out of\r\nhis mind. The presence of the tall ghostly figure, moving slowly\r\nthrough the halls, he took as a reproach to himself. When he thought of\r\nher he grew angry and swore. The hotel was unprofitable and forever on\r\nthe edge of failure and he wished himself out of it. He thought of the\r\nold house and the woman who lived there with him as things defeated and\r\ndone for. The hotel in which he had begun life so hopefully was now a\r\nmere ghost of what a hotel should be. As he went spruce and\r\nbusiness-like through the streets of Winesburg, he sometimes stopped\r\nand turned quickly about as though fearing that the spirit of the hotel\r\nand of the woman would follow him even into the streets. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn such a\r\nlife, damn it!\xe2\x80\x9d he sputtered aimlessly.\r\n\r\nTom Willard had a passion for village politics and for years had been\r\nthe leading Democrat in a strongly Republican community. Some day, he\r\ntold himself, the tide of things political will turn in my favor and\r\nthe years of ineffectual service count big in the bestowal of rewards.\r\nHe dreamed of going to Congress and even of becoming governor. Once\r\nwhen a younger member of the party arose at a political conference and\r\nbegan to boast of his faithful service, Tom Willard grew white with\r\nfury. \xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, glaring about. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know of\r\nservice? What are you but a boy? Look at what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done here! I was a\r\nDemocrat here in Winesburg when it was a crime to be a Democrat. In the\r\nold days they fairly hunted us with guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween Elizabeth and her one son George there was a deep unexpressed\r\nbond of sympathy, based on a girlhood dream that had long ago died. In\r\nthe son\xe2\x80\x99s presence she was timid and reserved, but sometimes while he\r\nhurried about town intent upon his duties as a reporter, she went into\r\nhis room and closing the door knelt by a little desk, made of a kitchen\r\ntable, that sat near a window. In the room by the desk she went through\r\na ceremony that was half a prayer, half a demand, addressed to the\r\nskies. In the boyish figure she yearned to see something half forgotten\r\nthat had once been a part of herself recreated. The prayer concerned\r\nthat. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though I die, I will in some way keep defeat from you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried, and so deep was her determination that her whole body shook. Her\r\neyes glowed and she clenched her fists. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am dead and see him\r\nbecoming a meaningless drab figure like myself, I will come back,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndeclared. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask God now to give me that privilege. I demand it. I will\r\npay for it. God may beat me with his fists. I will take any blow that\r\nmay befall if but this my boy be allowed to express something for us\r\nboth.\xe2\x80\x9d Pausing uncertainly, the woman stared about the boy\xe2\x80\x99s room. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\ndo not let him become smart and successful either,\xe2\x80\x9d she added vaguely.\r\n\r\nThe communion between George Willard and his mother was outwardly a\r\nformal thing without meaning. When she was ill and sat by the window in\r\nher room he sometimes went in the evening to make her a visit. They sat\r\nby a window that looked over the roof of a small frame building into\r\nMain Street. By turning their heads they could see through another\r\nwindow, along an alleyway that ran behind the Main Street stores and\r\ninto the back door of Abner Groff\xe2\x80\x99s bakery. Sometimes as they sat thus\r\na picture of village life presented itself to them. At the back door of\r\nhis shop appeared Abner Groff with a stick or an empty milk bottle in\r\nhis hand. For a long time there was a feud between the baker and a grey\r\ncat that belonged to Sylvester West, the druggist. The boy and his\r\nmother saw the cat creep into the door of the bakery and presently\r\nemerge followed by the baker, who swore and waved his arms about. The\r\nbaker\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were small and red and his black hair and beard were\r\nfilled with flour dust. Sometimes he was so angry that, although the\r\ncat had disappeared, he hurled sticks, bits of broken glass, and even\r\nsome of the tools of his trade about. Once he broke a window at the\r\nback of Sinning\xe2\x80\x99s Hardware Store. In the alley the grey cat crouched\r\nbehind barrels filled with torn paper and broken bottles above which\r\nflew a black swarm of flies. Once when she was alone, and after\r\nwatching a prolonged and ineffectual outburst on the part of the baker,\r\nElizabeth Willard put her head down on her long white hands and wept.\r\nAfter that she did not look along the alleyway any more, but tried to\r\nforget the contest between the bearded man and the cat. It seemed like\r\na rehearsal of her own life, terrible in its vividness.\r\n\r\nIn the evening when the son sat in the room with his mother, the\r\nsilence made them both feel awkward. Darkness came on and the evening\r\ntrain came in at the station. In the street below feet tramped up and\r\ndown upon a board sidewalk. In the station yard, after the evening\r\ntrain had gone, there was a heavy silence. Perhaps Skinner Leason, the\r\nexpress agent, moved a truck the length of the station platform. Over\r\non Main Street sounded a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, laughing. The door of the express\r\noffice banged. George Willard arose and crossing the room fumbled for\r\nthe doorknob. Sometimes he knocked against a chair, making it scrape\r\nalong the floor. By the window sat the sick woman, perfectly still,\r\nlistless. Her long hands, white and bloodless, could be seen drooping\r\nover the ends of the arms of the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better be out\r\namong the boys. You are too much indoors,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, striving to\r\nrelieve the embarrassment of the departure. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I would take a\r\nwalk,\xe2\x80\x9d replied George Willard, who felt awkward and confused.\r\n\r\nOne evening in July, when the transient guests who made the New Willard\r\nHouse their temporary home had become scarce, and the hallways, lighted\r\nonly by kerosene lamps turned low, were plunged in gloom, Elizabeth\r\nWillard had an adventure. She had been ill in bed for several days and\r\nher son had not come to visit her. She was alarmed. The feeble blaze of\r\nlife that remained in her body was blown into a flame by her anxiety\r\nand she crept out of bed, dressed and hurried along the hallway toward\r\nher son\xe2\x80\x99s room, shaking with exaggerated fears. As she went along she\r\nsteadied herself with her hand, slipped along the papered walls of the\r\nhall and breathed with difficulty. The air whistled through her teeth.\r\nAs she hurried forward she thought how foolish she was. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\nconcerned with boyish affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he has now\r\nbegun to walk about in the evening with girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth Willard had a dread of being seen by guests in the hotel that\r\nhad once belonged to her father and the ownership of which still stood\r\nrecorded in her name in the county courthouse. The hotel was\r\ncontinually losing patronage because of its shabbiness and she thought\r\nof herself as also shabby. Her own room was in an obscure corner and\r\nwhen she felt able to work she voluntarily worked among the beds,\r\npreferring the labor that could be done when the guests were abroad\r\nseeking trade among the merchants of Winesburg.\r\n\r\nBy the door of her son\xe2\x80\x99s room the mother knelt upon the floor and\r\nlistened for some sound from within. When she heard the boy moving\r\nabout and talking in low tones a smile came to her lips. George Willard\r\nhad a habit of talking aloud to himself and to hear him doing so had\r\nalways given his mother a peculiar pleasure. The habit in him, she\r\nfelt, strengthened the secret bond that existed between them. A\r\nthousand times she had whispered to herself of the matter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\ngroping about, trying to find himself,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not a dull\r\nclod, all words and smartness. Within him there is a secret something\r\nthat is striving to grow. It is the thing I let be killed in myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the darkness in the hallway by the door the sick woman arose and\r\nstarted again toward her own room. She was afraid that the door would\r\nopen and the boy come upon her. When she had reached a safe distance\r\nand was about to turn a corner into a second hallway she stopped and\r\nbracing herself with her hands waited, thinking to shake off a\r\ntrembling fit of weakness that had come upon her. The presence of the\r\nboy in the room had made her happy. In her bed, during the long hours\r\nalone, the little fears that had visited her had become giants. Now\r\nthey were all gone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get back to my room I shall sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured gratefully.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth Willard was not to return to her bed and to sleep. As she\r\nstood trembling in the darkness the door of her son\xe2\x80\x99s room opened and\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s father, Tom Willard, stepped out. In the light that steamed\r\nout at the door he stood with the knob in his hand and talked. What he\r\nsaid infuriated the woman.\r\n\r\nTom Willard was ambitious for his son. He had always thought of himself\r\nas a successful man, although nothing he had ever done had turned out\r\nsuccessfully. However, when he was out of sight of the New Willard\r\nHouse and had no fear of coming upon his wife, he swaggered and began\r\nto dramatize himself as one of the chief men of the town. He wanted his\r\nson to succeed. He it was who had secured for the boy the position on\r\nthe _Winesburg Eagle_. Now, with a ring of earnestness in his voice, he\r\nwas advising concerning some course of conduct. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what,\r\nGeorge, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wake up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWill Henderson has\r\nspoken to me three times concerning the matter. He says you go along\r\nfor hours not hearing when you are spoken to and acting like a gawky\r\ngirl. What ails you?\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Willard laughed good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\r\nguess you\xe2\x80\x99ll get over it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI told Will that. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a\r\nfool and you\xe2\x80\x99re not a woman. You\xe2\x80\x99re Tom Willard\xe2\x80\x99s son and you\xe2\x80\x99ll wake\r\nup. I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid. What you say clears things up. If being a newspaper\r\nman had put the notion of becoming a writer into your mind that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright. Only I guess you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wake up to do that too, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom Willard went briskly along the hallway and down a flight of stairs\r\nto the office. The woman in the darkness could hear him laughing and\r\ntalking with a guest who was striving to wear away a dull evening by\r\ndozing in a chair by the office door. She returned to the door of her\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s room. The weakness had passed from her body as by a miracle and\r\nshe stepped boldly along. A thousand ideas raced through her head. When\r\nshe heard the scraping of a chair and the sound of a pen scratching\r\nupon paper, she again turned and went back along the hallway to her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nA definite determination had come into the mind of the defeated wife of\r\nthe Winesburg hotel keeper. The determination was the result of long\r\nyears of quiet and rather ineffectual thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d she told\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x9cI will act. There is something threatening my boy and I will\r\nward it off.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact that the conversation between Tom Willard and\r\nhis son had been rather quiet and natural, as though an understanding\r\nexisted between them, maddened her. Although for years she had hated\r\nher husband, her hatred had always before been a quite impersonal\r\nthing. He had been merely a part of something else that she hated. Now,\r\nand by the few words at the door, he had become the thing personified.\r\nIn the darkness of her own room she clenched her fists and glared\r\nabout. Going to a cloth bag that hung on a nail by the wall she took\r\nout a long pair of sewing scissors and held them in her hand like a\r\ndagger. \xe2\x80\x9cI will stab him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has chosen to be the\r\nvoice of evil and I will kill him. When I have killed him something\r\nwill snap within myself and I will die also. It will be a release for\r\nall of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her girlhood and before her marriage with Tom Willard, Elizabeth had\r\nborne a somewhat shaky reputation in Winesburg. For years she had been\r\nwhat is called \xe2\x80\x9cstage-struck\xe2\x80\x9d and had paraded through the streets with\r\ntraveling men guests at her father\xe2\x80\x99s hotel, wearing loud clothes and\r\nurging them to tell her of life in the cities out of which they had\r\ncome. Once she startled the town by putting on men\xe2\x80\x99s clothes and riding\r\na bicycle down Main Street.\r\n\r\nIn her own mind the tall dark girl had been in those days much\r\nconfused. A great restlessness was in her and it expressed itself in\r\ntwo ways. First there was an uneasy desire for change, for some big\r\ndefinite movement to her life. It was this feeling that had turned her\r\nmind to the stage. She dreamed of joining some company and wandering\r\nover the world, seeing always new faces and giving something out of\r\nherself to all people. Sometimes at night she was quite beside herself\r\nwith the thought, but when she tried to talk of the matter to the\r\nmembers of the theatrical companies that came to Winesburg and stopped\r\nat her father\xe2\x80\x99s hotel, she got nowhere. They did not seem to know what\r\nshe meant, or if she did get something of her passion expressed, they\r\nonly laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like that,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as dull and\r\nuninteresting as this here. Nothing comes of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the traveling men when she walked about with them, and later with\r\nTom Willard, it was quite different. Always they seemed to understand\r\nand sympathize with her. On the side streets of the village, in the\r\ndarkness under the trees, they took hold of her hand and she thought\r\nthat something unexpressed in herself came forth and became a part of\r\nan unexpressed something in them.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the second expression of her restlessness. When that\r\ncame she felt for a time released and happy. She did not blame the men\r\nwho walked with her and later she did not blame Tom Willard. It was\r\nalways the same, beginning with kisses and ending, after strange wild\r\nemotions, with peace and then sobbing repentance. When she sobbed she\r\nput her hand upon the face of the man and had always the same thought.\r\nEven though he were large and bearded she thought he had become\r\nsuddenly a little boy. She wondered why he did not sob also.\r\n\r\nIn her room, tucked away in a corner of the old Willard House,\r\nElizabeth Willard lighted a lamp and put it on a dressing table that\r\nstood by the door. A thought had come into her mind and she went to a\r\ncloset and brought out a small square box and set it on the table. The\r\nbox contained material for make-up and had been left with other things\r\nby a theatrical company that had once been stranded in Winesburg.\r\nElizabeth Willard had decided that she would be beautiful. Her hair was\r\nstill black and there was a great mass of it braided and coiled about\r\nher head. The scene that was to take place in the office below began to\r\ngrow in her mind. No ghostly worn-out figure should confront Tom\r\nWillard, but something quite unexpected and startling. Tall and with\r\ndusky cheeks and hair that fell in a mass from her shoulders, a figure\r\nshould come striding down the stairway before the startled loungers in\r\nthe hotel office. The figure would be silent\xe2\x80\x94it would be swift and\r\nterrible. As a tigress whose cub had been threatened would she appear,\r\ncoming out of the shadows, stealing noiselessly along and holding the\r\nlong wicked scissors in her hand.\r\n\r\nWith a little broken sob in her throat, Elizabeth Willard blew out the\r\nlight that stood upon the table and stood weak and trembling in the\r\ndarkness. The strength that had been as a miracle in her body left and\r\nshe half reeled across the floor, clutching at the back of the chair in\r\nwhich she had spent so many long days staring out over the tin roofs\r\ninto the main street of Winesburg. In the hallway there was the sound\r\nof footsteps and George Willard came in at the door. Sitting in a chair\r\nbeside his mother he began to talk. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out of here,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where I shall go or what I shall do but I am going\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman in the chair waited and trembled. An impulse came to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you had better wake up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think that? You will go\r\nto the city and make money, eh? It will be better for you, you think,\r\nto be a business man, to be brisk and smart and alive?\xe2\x80\x9d She waited and\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\nThe son shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I can\xe2\x80\x99t make you understand, but oh,\r\nI wish I could,\xe2\x80\x9d he said earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to father about\r\nit. I don\xe2\x80\x99t try. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t any use. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall do. I\r\njust want to go away and look at people and think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilence fell upon the room where the boy and woman sat together. Again,\r\nas on the other evenings, they were embarrassed. After a time the boy\r\ntried again to talk. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for a year or two but I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen thinking about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising and going toward the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething father said makes it sure that I shall have to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nfumbled with the doorknob. In the room the silence became unbearable to\r\nthe woman. She wanted to cry out with joy because of the words that had\r\ncome from the lips of her son, but the expression of joy had become\r\nimpossible to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better go out among the boys. You\r\nare too much indoors,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I would go for a little\r\nwalk,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the son stepping awkwardly out of the room and closing\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHER\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Parcival was a large man with a drooping mouth covered by a\r\nyellow mustache. He always wore a dirty white waistcoat out of the\r\npockets of which protruded a number of the kind of black cigars known\r\nas stogies. His teeth were black and irregular and there was something\r\nstrange about his eyes. The lid of the left eye twitched; it fell down\r\nand snapped up; it was exactly as though the lid of the eye were a\r\nwindow shade and someone stood inside the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s head playing with\r\nthe cord.\r\n\r\nDoctor Parcival had a liking for the boy, George Willard. It began when\r\nGeorge had been working for a year on the _Winesburg Eagle_ and the\r\nacquaintanceship was entirely a matter of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s own making.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon Will Henderson, owner and editor of the _Eagle_,\r\nwent over to Tom Willy\xe2\x80\x99s saloon. Along an alleyway he went and slipping\r\nin at the back door of the saloon began drinking a drink made of a\r\ncombination of sloe gin and soda water. Will Henderson was a sensualist\r\nand had reached the age of forty-five. He imagined the gin renewed the\r\nyouth in him. Like most sensualists he enjoyed talking of women, and\r\nfor an hour he lingered about gossiping with Tom Willy. The saloon\r\nkeeper was a short, broad-shouldered man with peculiarly marked hands.\r\nThat flaming kind of birthmark that sometimes paints with red the faces\r\nof men and women had touched with red Tom Willy\xe2\x80\x99s fingers and the backs\r\nof his hands. As he stood by the bar talking to Will Henderson he\r\nrubbed the hands together. As he grew more and more excited the red of\r\nhis fingers deepened. It was as though the hands had been dipped in\r\nblood that had dried and faded.\r\n\r\nAs Will Henderson stood at the bar looking at the red hands and talking\r\nof women, his assistant, George Willard, sat in the office of the\r\n_Winesburg Eagle_ and listened to the talk of Doctor Parcival.\r\n\r\nDoctor Parcival appeared immediately after Will Henderson had\r\ndisappeared. One might have supposed that the doctor had been watching\r\nfrom his office window and had seen the editor going along the\r\nalleyway. Coming in at the front door and finding himself a chair, he\r\nlighted one of the stogies and crossing his legs began to talk. He\r\nseemed intent upon convincing the boy of the advisability of adopting a\r\nline of conduct that he was himself unable to define.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have your eyes open you will see that although I call myself a\r\ndoctor I have mighty few patients,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a reason for\r\nthat. It is not an accident and it is not because I do not know as much\r\nof medicine as anyone here. I do not want patients. The reason, you\r\nsee, does not appear on the surface. It lies in fact in my character,\r\nwhich has, if you think about it, many strange turns. Why I want to\r\ntalk to you of the matter I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I might keep still and get more\r\ncredit in your eyes. I have a desire to make you admire me, that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfact. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I talk. It\xe2\x80\x99s very amusing, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes the doctor launched into long tales concerning himself. To\r\nthe boy the tales were very real and full of meaning. He began to\r\nadmire the fat unclean-looking man and, in the afternoon when Will\r\nHenderson had gone, looked forward with keen interest to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nDoctor Parcival had been in Winesburg about five years. He came from\r\nChicago and when he arrived was drunk and got into a fight with Albert\r\nLongworth, the baggageman. The fight concerned a trunk and ended by the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s being escorted to the village lockup. When he was released he\r\nrented a room above a shoe-repairing shop at the lower end of Main\r\nStreet and put out the sign that announced himself as a doctor.\r\nAlthough he had but few patients and these of the poorer sort who were\r\nunable to pay, he seemed to have plenty of money for his needs. He\r\nslept in the office that was unspeakably dirty and dined at Biff\r\nCarter\xe2\x80\x99s lunch room in a small frame building opposite the railroad\r\nstation. In the summer the lunch room was filled with flies and Biff\r\nCarter\xe2\x80\x99s white apron was more dirty than his floor. Doctor Parcival did\r\nnot mind. Into the lunch room he stalked and deposited twenty cents\r\nupon the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cFeed me what you wish for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said laughing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUse up food that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise sell. It makes no difference\r\nto me. I am a man of distinction, you see. Why should I concern myself\r\nwith what I eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tales that Doctor Parcival told George Willard began nowhere and\r\nended nowhere. Sometimes the boy thought they must all be inventions, a\r\npack of lies. And then again he was convinced that they contained the\r\nvery essence of truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a reporter like you here,\xe2\x80\x9d Doctor Parcival began. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in a\r\ntown in Iowa\xe2\x80\x94or was it in Illinois? I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember and anyway it\r\nmakes no difference. Perhaps I am trying to conceal my identity and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to be very definite. Have you ever thought it strange that I\r\nhave money for my needs although I do nothing? I may have stolen a\r\ngreat sum of money or been involved in a murder before I came here.\r\nThere is food for thought in that, eh? If you were a really smart\r\nnewspaper reporter you would look me up. In Chicago there was a Doctor\r\nCronin who was murdered. Have you heard of that? Some men murdered him\r\nand put him in a trunk. In the early morning they hauled the trunk\r\nacross the city. It sat on the back of an express wagon and they were\r\non the seat as unconcerned as anything. Along they went through quiet\r\nstreets where everyone was asleep. The sun was just coming up over the\r\nlake. Funny, eh\xe2\x80\x94just to think of them smoking pipes and chattering as\r\nthey drove along as unconcerned as I am now. Perhaps I was one of those\r\nmen. That would be a strange turn of things, now wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAgain Doctor Parcival began his tale: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyway there I was, a\r\nreporter on a paper just as you are here, running about and getting\r\nlittle items to print. My mother was poor. She took in washing. Her\r\ndream was to make me a Presbyterian minister and I was studying with\r\nthat end in view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father had been insane for a number of years. He was in an asylum\r\nover at Dayton, Ohio. There you see I have let it slip out! All of this\r\ntook place in Ohio, right here in Ohio. There is a clew if you ever get\r\nthe notion of looking me up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to tell you of my brother. That\xe2\x80\x99s the object of all this.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at. My brother was a railroad painter and had a\r\njob on the Big Four. You know that road runs through Ohio here. With\r\nother men he lived in a box car and away they went from town to town\r\npainting the railroad property-switches, crossing gates, bridges, and\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Four paints its stations a nasty orange color. How I hated\r\nthat color! My brother was always covered with it. On pay days he used\r\nto get drunk and come home wearing his paint-covered clothes and\r\nbringing his money with him. He did not give it to mother but laid it\r\nin a pile on our kitchen table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the house he went in the clothes covered with the nasty orange\r\ncolored paint. I can see the picture. My mother, who was small and had\r\nred, sad-looking eyes, would come into the house from a little shed at\r\nthe back. That\xe2\x80\x99s where she spent her time over the washtub scrubbing\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s dirty clothes. In she would come and stand by the table,\r\nrubbing her eyes with her apron that was covered with soap-suds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare touch that money,\xe2\x80\x99 my brother roared,\r\nand then he himself took five or ten dollars and went tramping off to\r\nthe saloons. When he had spent what he had taken he came back for more.\r\nHe never gave my mother any money at all but stayed about until he had\r\nspent it all, a little at a time. Then he went back to his job with the\r\npainting crew on the railroad. After he had gone things began to arrive\r\nat our house, groceries and such things. Sometimes there would be a\r\ndress for mother or a pair of shoes for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange, eh? My mother loved my brother much more than she did me,\r\nalthough he never said a kind word to either of us and always raved up\r\nand down threatening us if we dared so much as touch the money that\r\nsometimes lay on the table three days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe got along pretty well. I studied to be a minister and prayed. I was\r\na regular ass about saying prayers. You should have heard me. When my\r\nfather died I prayed all night, just as I did sometimes when my brother\r\nwas in town drinking and going about buying the things for us. In the\r\nevening after supper I knelt by the table where the money lay and\r\nprayed for hours. When no one was looking I stole a dollar or two and\r\nput it in my pocket. That makes me laugh now but then it was terrible.\r\nIt was on my mind all the time. I got six dollars a week from my job on\r\nthe paper and always took it straight home to mother. The few dollars I\r\nstole from my brother\xe2\x80\x99s pile I spent on myself, you know, for trifles,\r\ncandy and cigarettes and such things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my father died at the asylum over at Dayton, I went over there. I\r\nborrowed some money from the man for whom I worked and went on the\r\ntrain at night. It was raining. In the asylum they treated me as though\r\nI were a king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men who had jobs in the asylum had found out I was a newspaper\r\nreporter. That made them afraid. There had been some negligence, some\r\ncarelessness, you see, when father was ill. They thought perhaps I\r\nwould write it up in the paper and make a fuss. I never intended to do\r\nanything of the kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, in I went to the room where my father lay dead and blessed the\r\ndead body. I wonder what put that notion into my head. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nbrother, the painter, have laughed, though. There I stood over the dead\r\nbody and spread out my hands. The superintendent of the asylum and some\r\nof his helpers came in and stood about looking sheepish. It was very\r\namusing. I spread out my hands and said, \xe2\x80\x98Let peace brood over this\r\ncarcass.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJumping to his feet and breaking off the tale, Doctor Parcival began to\r\nwalk up and down in the office of the _Winesburg Eagle_ where George\r\nWillard sat listening. He was awkward and, as the office was small,\r\ncontinually knocked against things. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I am to be talking,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not my object in coming here and forcing my\r\nacquaintanceship upon you. I have something else in mind. You are a\r\nreporter just as I was once and you have attracted my attention. You\r\nmay end by becoming just such another fool. I want to warn you and keep\r\non warning you. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I seek you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Parcival began talking of George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s attitude toward men.\r\nIt seemed to the boy that the man had but one object in view, to make\r\neveryone seem despicable. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to fill you with hatred and contempt\r\nso that you will be a superior being,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at my\r\nbrother. There was a fellow, eh? He despised everyone, you see. You\r\nhave no idea with what contempt he looked upon mother and me. And was\r\nhe not our superior? You know he was. You have not seen him and yet I\r\nhave made you feel that. I have given you a sense of it. He is dead.\r\nOnce when he was drunk he lay down on the tracks and the car in which\r\nhe lived with the other painters ran over him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in August Doctor Parcival had an adventure in Winesburg. For a\r\nmonth George Willard had been going each morning to spend an hour in\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office. The visits came about through a desire on the part\r\nof the doctor to read to the boy from the pages of a book he was in the\r\nprocess of writing. To write the book Doctor Parcival declared was the\r\nobject of his coming to Winesburg to live.\r\n\r\nOn the morning in August before the coming of the boy, an incident had\r\nhappened in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office. There had been an accident on Main\r\nStreet. A team of horses had been frightened by a train and had run\r\naway. A little girl, the daughter of a farmer, had been thrown from a\r\nbuggy and killed.\r\n\r\nOn Main Street everyone had become excited and a cry for doctors had\r\ngone up. All three of the active practitioners of the town had come\r\nquickly but had found the child dead. From the crowd someone had run to\r\nthe office of Doctor Parcival who had bluntly refused to go down out of\r\nhis office to the dead child. The useless cruelty of his refusal had\r\npassed unnoticed. Indeed, the man who had come up the stairway to\r\nsummon him had hurried away without hearing the refusal.\r\n\r\nAll of this, Doctor Parcival did not know and when George Willard came\r\nto his office he found the man shaking with terror. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have done\r\nwill arouse the people of this town,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I not\r\nknow human nature? Do I not know what will happen? Word of my refusal\r\nwill be whispered about. Presently men will get together in groups and\r\ntalk of it. They will come here. We will quarrel and there will be talk\r\nof hanging. Then they will come again bearing a rope in their hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Parcival shook with fright. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a presentiment,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared\r\nemphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that what I am talking about will not occur\r\nthis morning. It may be put off until tonight but I will be hanged.\r\nEveryone will get excited. I will be hanged to a lamp-post on Main\r\nStreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoing to the door of his dirty office, Doctor Parcival looked timidly\r\ndown the stairway leading to the street. When he returned the fright\r\nthat had been in his eyes was beginning to be replaced by doubt. Coming\r\non tiptoe across the room he tapped George Willard on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nnot now, sometime,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the end I will\r\nbe crucified, uselessly crucified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Parcival began to plead with George Willard. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must pay\r\nattention to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged. \xe2\x80\x9cIf something happens perhaps you will be\r\nable to write the book that I may never get written. The idea is very\r\nsimple, so simple that if you are not careful you will forget it. It is\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94that everyone in the world is Christ and they are all crucified.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to say. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget that. Whatever happens,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you dare let yourself forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBODY KNOWS\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking cautiously about, George Willard arose from his desk in the\r\noffice of the _Winesburg Eagle_ and went hurriedly out at the back\r\ndoor. The night was warm and cloudy and although it was not yet eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, the alleyway back of the _Eagle_ office was pitch dark. A team\r\nof horses tied to a post somewhere in the darkness stamped on the\r\nhard-baked ground. A cat sprang from under George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s feet and\r\nran away into the night. The young man was nervous. All day he had gone\r\nabout his work like one dazed by a blow. In the alleyway he trembled as\r\nthough with fright.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness George Willard walked along the alleyway, going\r\ncarefully and cautiously. The back doors of the Winesburg stores were\r\nopen and he could see men sitting about under the store lamps. In\r\nMyerbaum\xe2\x80\x99s Notion Store Mrs. Willy the saloon keeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife stood by\r\nthe counter with a basket on her arm. Sid Green the clerk was waiting\r\non her. He leaned over the counter and talked earnestly.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard crouched and then jumped through the path of light that\r\ncame out at the door. He began to run forward in the darkness. Behind\r\nEd Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s saloon old Jerry Bird the town drunkard lay asleep on the\r\nground. The runner stumbled over the sprawling legs. He laughed\r\nbrokenly.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard had set forth upon an adventure. All day he had been\r\ntrying to make up his mind to go through with the adventure and now he\r\nwas acting. In the office of the _Winesburg Eagle_ he had been sitting\r\nsince six o\xe2\x80\x99clock trying to think.\r\n\r\nThere had been no decision. He had just jumped to his feet, hurried\r\npast Will Henderson who was reading proof in the printshop and started\r\nto run along the alleyway.\r\n\r\nThrough street after street went George Willard, avoiding the people\r\nwho passed. He crossed and recrossed the road. When he passed a street\r\nlamp he pulled his hat down over his face. He did not dare think. In\r\nhis mind there was a fear but it was a new kind of fear. He was afraid\r\nthe adventure on which he had set out would be spoiled, that he would\r\nlose courage and turn back.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard found Louise Trunnion in the kitchen of her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. She was washing dishes by the light of a kerosene lamp. There\r\nshe stood behind the screen door in the little shedlike kitchen at the\r\nback of the house. George Willard stopped by a picket fence and tried\r\nto control the shaking of his body. Only a narrow potato patch\r\nseparated him from the adventure. Five minutes passed before he felt\r\nsure enough of himself to call to her. \xe2\x80\x9cLouise! Oh, Louise!\xe2\x80\x9d he called.\r\nThe cry stuck in his throat. His voice became a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\nLouise Trunnion came out across the potato patch holding the dish cloth\r\nin her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know I want to go out with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nsulkily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you so sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard did not answer. In silence the two stood in the darkness\r\nwith the fence between them. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go on along,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPa\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come along. You wait by Williams\xe2\x80\x99 barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young newspaper reporter had received a letter from Louise\r\nTrunnion. It had come that morning to the office of the _Winesburg\r\nEagle_. The letter was brief. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m yours if you want me,\xe2\x80\x9d it said. He\r\nthought it annoying that in the darkness by the fence she had pretended\r\nthere was nothing between them. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has a nerve! Well, gracious sakes,\r\nshe has a nerve,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered as he went along the street and passed a\r\nrow of vacant lots where corn grew. The corn was shoulder high and had\r\nbeen planted right down to the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nWhen Louise Trunnion came out of the front door of her house she still\r\nwore the gingham dress in which she had been washing dishes. There was\r\nno hat on her head. The boy could see her standing with the doorknob in\r\nher hand talking to someone within, no doubt to old Jake Trunnion, her\r\nfather. Old Jake was half deaf and she shouted. The door closed and\r\neverything was dark and silent in the little side street. George\r\nWillard trembled more violently than ever.\r\n\r\nIn the shadows by Williams\xe2\x80\x99 barn George and Louise stood, not daring to\r\ntalk. She was not particularly comely and there was a black smudge on\r\nthe side of her nose. George thought she must have rubbed her nose with\r\nher finger after she had been handling some of the kitchen pots.\r\n\r\nThe young man began to laugh nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s warm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He wanted\r\nto touch her with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not very bold,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. Just to\r\ntouch the folds of the soiled gingham dress would, he decided, be an\r\nexquisite pleasure. She began to quibble. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think you\xe2\x80\x99re better than\r\nI am. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, I guess I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said drawing closer to him.\r\n\r\nA flood of words burst from George Willard. He remembered the look that\r\nhad lurked in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when they had met on the streets and\r\nthought of the note she had written. Doubt left him. The whispered\r\ntales concerning her that had gone about town gave him confidence. He\r\nbecame wholly the male, bold and aggressive. In his heart there was no\r\nsympathy for her. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, come on, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. There won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nanyone know anything. How can they know?\xe2\x80\x9d he urged.\r\n\r\nThey began to walk along a narrow brick sidewalk between the cracks of\r\nwhich tall weeds grew. Some of the bricks were missing and the sidewalk\r\nwas rough and irregular. He took hold of her hand that was also rough\r\nand thought it delightfully small. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go far,\xe2\x80\x9d she said and her\r\nvoice was quiet, unperturbed.\r\n\r\nThey crossed a bridge that ran over a tiny stream and passed another\r\nvacant lot in which corn grew. The street ended. In the path at the\r\nside of the road they were compelled to walk one behind the other. Will\r\nOverton\xe2\x80\x99s berry field lay beside the road and there was a pile of\r\nboards. \xe2\x80\x9cWill is going to build a shed to store berry crates here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George and they sat down upon the boards.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George Willard got back into Main Street it was past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nand had begun to rain. Three times he walked up and down the length of\r\nMain Street. Sylvester West\xe2\x80\x99s Drug Store was still open and he went in\r\nand bought a cigar. When Shorty Crandall the clerk came out at the door\r\nwith him he was pleased. For five minutes the two stood in the shelter\r\nof the store awning and talked. George Willard felt satisfied. He had\r\nwanted more than anything else to talk to some man. Around a corner\r\ntoward the New Willard House he went whistling softly.\r\n\r\nOn the sidewalk at the side of Winney\xe2\x80\x99s Dry Goods Store where there was\r\na high board fence covered with circus pictures, he stopped whistling\r\nand stood perfectly still in the darkness, attentive, listening as\r\nthough for a voice calling his name. Then again he laughed nervously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got anything on me. Nobody knows,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered doggedly and\r\nwent on his way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGODLINESS\r\n\r\nA TALE IN FOUR PARTS\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\nThere were always three or four old people sitting on the front porch\r\nof the house or puttering about the garden of the Bentley farm. Three\r\nof the old people were women and sisters to Jesse. They were a\r\ncolorless, soft voiced lot. Then there was a silent old man with thin\r\nwhite hair who was Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s uncle.\r\n\r\nThe farmhouse was built of wood, a board outer-covering over a\r\nframework of logs. It was in reality not one house but a cluster of\r\nhouses joined together in a rather haphazard manner. Inside, the place\r\nwas full of surprises. One went up steps from the living room into the\r\ndining room and there were always steps to be ascended or descended in\r\npassing from one room to another. At meal times the place was like a\r\nbeehive. At one moment all was quiet, then doors began to open, feet\r\nclattered on stairs, a murmur of soft voices arose and people appeared\r\nfrom a dozen obscure corners.\r\n\r\nBesides the old people, already mentioned, many others lived in the\r\nBentley house. There were four hired men, a woman named Aunt Callie\r\nBeebe, who was in charge of the housekeeping, a dull-witted girl named\r\nEliza Stoughton, who made beds and helped with the milking, a boy who\r\nworked in the stables, and Jesse Bentley himself, the owner and\r\noverlord of it all.\r\n\r\nBy the time the American Civil War had been over for twenty years, that\r\npart of Northern Ohio where the Bentley farms lay had begun to emerge\r\nfrom pioneer life. Jesse then owned machinery for harvesting grain. He\r\nhad built modern barns and most of his land was drained with carefully\r\nlaid tile drain, but in order to understand the man we will have to go\r\nback to an earlier day.\r\n\r\nThe Bentley family had been in Northern Ohio for several generations\r\nbefore Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s time. They came from New York State and took up land\r\nwhen the country was new and land could be had at a low price. For a\r\nlong time they, in common with all the other Middle Western people,\r\nwere very poor. The land they had settled upon was heavily wooded and\r\ncovered with fallen logs and underbrush. After the long hard labor of\r\nclearing these away and cutting the timber, there were still the stumps\r\nto be reckoned with. Plows run through the fields caught on hidden\r\nroots, stones lay all about, on the low places water gathered, and the\r\nyoung corn turned yellow, sickened and died.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesse Bentley\xe2\x80\x99s father and brothers had come into their ownership\r\nof the place, much of the harder part of the work of clearing had been\r\ndone, but they clung to old traditions and worked like driven animals.\r\nThey lived as practically all of the farming people of the time lived.\r\nIn the spring and through most of the winter the highways leading into\r\nthe town of Winesburg were a sea of mud. The four young men of the\r\nfamily worked hard all day in the fields, they ate heavily of coarse,\r\ngreasy food, and at night slept like tired beasts on beds of straw.\r\nInto their lives came little that was not coarse and brutal and\r\noutwardly they were themselves coarse and brutal. On Saturday\r\nafternoons they hitched a team of horses to a three-seated wagon and\r\nwent off to town. In town they stood about the stoves in the stores\r\ntalking to other farmers or to the store keepers. They were dressed in\r\noveralls and in the winter wore heavy coats that were flecked with mud.\r\nTheir hands as they stretched them out to the heat of the stoves were\r\ncracked and red. It was difficult for them to talk and so they for the\r\nmost part kept silent. When they had bought meat, flour, sugar, and\r\nsalt, they went into one of the Winesburg saloons and drank beer. Under\r\nthe influence of drink the naturally strong lusts of their natures,\r\nkept suppressed by the heroic labor of breaking up new ground, were\r\nreleased. A kind of crude and animal-like poetic fervor took possession\r\nof them. On the road home they stood up on the wagon seats and shouted\r\nat the stars. Sometimes they fought long and bitterly and at other\r\ntimes they broke forth into songs. Once Enoch Bentley, the older one of\r\nthe boys, struck his father, old Tom Bentley, with the butt of a\r\nteamster\xe2\x80\x99s whip, and the old man seemed likely to die. For days Enoch\r\nlay hid in the straw in the loft of the stable ready to flee if the\r\nresult of his momentary passion turned out to be murder. He was kept\r\nalive with food brought by his mother, who also kept him informed of\r\nthe injured man\xe2\x80\x99s condition. When all turned out well he emerged from\r\nhis hiding place and went back to the work of clearing land as though\r\nnothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Civil War brought a sharp turn to the fortunes of the Bentleys and\r\nwas responsible for the rise of the youngest son, Jesse. Enoch, Edward,\r\nHarry, and Will Bentley all enlisted and before the long war ended they\r\nwere all killed. For a time after they went away to the South, old Tom\r\ntried to run the place, but he was not successful. When the last of the\r\nfour had been killed he sent word to Jesse that he would have to come\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThen the mother, who had not been well for a year, died suddenly, and\r\nthe father became altogether discouraged. He talked of selling the farm\r\nand moving into town. All day he went about shaking his head and\r\nmuttering. The work in the fields was neglected and weeds grew high in\r\nthe corn. Old Tom hired men but he did not use them intelligently. When\r\nthey had gone away to the fields in the morning he wandered into the\r\nwoods and sat down on a log. Sometimes he forgot to come home at night\r\nand one of the daughters had to go in search of him.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesse Bentley came home to the farm and began to take charge of\r\nthings he was a slight, sensitive-looking man of twenty-two. At\r\neighteen he had left home to go to school to become a scholar and\r\neventually to become a minister of the Presbyterian Church. All through\r\nhis boyhood he had been what in our country was called an \xe2\x80\x9codd sheep\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand had not got on with his brothers. Of all the family only his mother\r\nhad understood him and she was now dead. When he came home to take\r\ncharge of the farm, that had at that time grown to more than six\r\nhundred acres, everyone on the farms about and in the nearby town of\r\nWinesburg smiled at the idea of his trying to handle the work that had\r\nbeen done by his four strong brothers.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed good cause to smile. By the standards of his day Jesse\r\ndid not look like a man at all. He was small and very slender and\r\nwomanish of body and, true to the traditions of young ministers, wore a\r\nlong black coat and a narrow black string tie. The neighbors were\r\namused when they saw him, after the years away, and they were even more\r\namused when they saw the woman he had married in the city.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s wife did soon go under. That was perhaps\r\nJesse\xe2\x80\x99s fault. A farm in Northern Ohio in the hard years after the\r\nCivil War was no place for a delicate woman, and Katherine Bentley was\r\ndelicate. Jesse was hard with her as he was with everybody about him in\r\nthose days. She tried to do such work as all the neighbor women about\r\nher did and he let her go on without interference. She helped to do the\r\nmilking and did part of the housework; she made the beds for the men\r\nand prepared their food. For a year she worked every day from sunrise\r\nuntil late at night and then after giving birth to a child she died.\r\n\r\nAs for Jesse Bentley\xe2\x80\x94although he was a delicately built man there was\r\nsomething within him that could not easily be killed. He had brown\r\ncurly hair and grey eyes that were at times hard and direct, at times\r\nwavering and uncertain. Not only was he slender but he was also short\r\nof stature. His mouth was like the mouth of a sensitive and very\r\ndetermined child. Jesse Bentley was a fanatic. He was a man born out of\r\nhis time and place and for this he suffered and made others suffer.\r\nNever did he succeed in getting what he wanted out of life and he did\r\nnot know what he wanted. Within a very short time after he came home to\r\nthe Bentley farm he made everyone there a little afraid of him, and his\r\nwife, who should have been close to him as his mother had been, was\r\nafraid also. At the end of two weeks after his coming, old Tom Bentley\r\nmade over to him the entire ownership of the place and retired into the\r\nbackground. Everyone retired into the background. In spite of his youth\r\nand inexperience, Jesse had the trick of mastering the souls of his\r\npeople. He was so in earnest in everything he did and said that no one\r\nunderstood him. He made everyone on the farm work as they had never\r\nworked before and yet there was no joy in the work. If things went well\r\nthey went well for Jesse and never for the people who were his\r\ndependents. Like a thousand other strong men who have come into the\r\nworld here in America in these later times, Jesse was but half strong.\r\nHe could master others but he could not master himself. The running of\r\nthe farm as it had never been run before was easy for him. When he came\r\nhome from Cleveland where he had been in school, he shut himself off\r\nfrom all of his people and began to make plans. He thought about the\r\nfarm night and day and that made him successful. Other men on the farms\r\nabout him worked too hard and were too fired to think, but to think of\r\nthe farm and to be everlastingly making plans for its success was a\r\nrelief to Jesse. It partially satisfied something in his passionate\r\nnature. Immediately after he came home he had a wing built on to the\r\nold house and in a large room facing the west he had windows that\r\nlooked into the barnyard and other windows that looked off across the\r\nfields. By the window he sat down to think. Hour after hour and day\r\nafter day he sat and looked over the land and thought out his new place\r\nin life. The passionate burning thing in his nature flamed up and his\r\neyes became hard. He wanted to make the farm produce as no farm in his\r\nstate had ever produced before and then he wanted something else. It\r\nwas the indefinable hunger within that made his eyes waver and that\r\nkept him always more and more silent before people. He would have given\r\nmuch to achieve peace and in him was a fear that peace was the thing he\r\ncould not achieve.\r\n\r\nAll over his body Jesse Bentley was alive. In his small frame was\r\ngathered the force of a long line of strong men. He had always been\r\nextraordinarily alive when he was a small boy on the farm and later\r\nwhen he was a young man in school. In the school he had studied and\r\nthought of God and the Bible with his whole mind and heart. As time\r\npassed and he grew to know people better, he began to think of himself\r\nas an extraordinary man, one set apart from his fellows. He wanted\r\nterribly to make his life a thing of great importance, and as he looked\r\nabout at his fellow men and saw how like clods they lived it seemed to\r\nhim that he could not bear to become also such a clod. Although in his\r\nabsorption in himself and in his own destiny he was blind to the fact\r\nthat his young wife was doing a strong woman\xe2\x80\x99s work even after she had\r\nbecome large with child and that she was killing herself in his\r\nservice, he did not intend to be unkind to her. When his father, who\r\nwas old and twisted with toil, made over to him the ownership of the\r\nfarm and seemed content to creep away to a corner and wait for death,\r\nhe shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the old man from his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the room by the window overlooking the land that had come down to\r\nhim sat Jesse thinking of his own affairs. In the stables he could hear\r\nthe tramping of his horses and the restless movement of his cattle.\r\nAway in the fields he could see other cattle wandering over green\r\nhills. The voices of men, his men who worked for him, came in to him\r\nthrough the window. From the milkhouse there was the steady thump,\r\nthump of a churn being manipulated by the half-witted girl, Eliza\r\nStoughton. Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s mind went back to the men of Old Testament days who\r\nhad also owned lands and herds. He remembered how God had come down out\r\nof the skies and talked to these men and he wanted God to notice and to\r\ntalk to him also. A kind of feverish boyish eagerness to in some way\r\nachieve in his own life the flavor of significance that had hung over\r\nthese men took possession of him. Being a prayerful man he spoke of the\r\nmatter aloud to God and the sound of his own words strengthened and fed\r\nhis eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a new kind of man come into possession of these fields,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared. \xe2\x80\x9cLook upon me, O God, and look Thou also upon my neighbors\r\nand all the men who have gone before me here! O God, create in me\r\nanother Jesse, like that one of old, to rule over men and to be the\r\nfather of sons who shall be rulers!\xe2\x80\x9d Jesse grew excited as he talked\r\naloud and jumping to his feet walked up and down in the room. In fancy\r\nhe saw himself living in old times and among old peoples. The land that\r\nlay stretched out before him became of vast significance, a place\r\npeopled by his fancy with a new race of men sprung from himself. It\r\nseemed to him that in his day as in those other and older days,\r\nkingdoms might be created and new impulses given to the lives of men by\r\nthe power of God speaking through a chosen servant. He longed to be\r\nsuch a servant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is God\xe2\x80\x99s work I have come to the land to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared in a loud voice and his short figure straightened and he\r\nthought that something like a halo of Godly approval hung over him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be somewhat difficult for the men and women of a later\r\nday to understand Jesse Bentley. In the last fifty years a vast change\r\nhas taken place in the lives of our people. A revolution has in fact\r\ntaken place. The coming of industrialism, attended by all the roar and\r\nrattle of affairs, the shrill cries of millions of new voices that have\r\ncome among us from overseas, the going and coming of trains, the growth\r\nof cities, the building of the inter-urban car lines that weave in and\r\nout of towns and past farmhouses, and now in these later days the\r\ncoming of the automobiles has worked a tremendous change in the lives\r\nand in the habits of thought of our people of Mid-America. Books, badly\r\nimagined and written though they may be in the hurry of our times, are\r\nin every household, magazines circulate by the millions of copies,\r\nnewspapers are everywhere. In our day a farmer standing by the stove in\r\nthe store in his village has his mind filled to overflowing with the\r\nwords of other men. The newspapers and the magazines have pumped him\r\nfull. Much of the old brutal ignorance that had in it also a kind of\r\nbeautiful childlike innocence is gone forever. The farmer by the stove\r\nis brother to the men of the cities, and if you listen you will find\r\nhim talking as glibly and as senselessly as the best city man of us\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn Jesse Bentley\xe2\x80\x99s time and in the country districts of the whole\r\nMiddle West in the years after the Civil War it was not so. Men labored\r\ntoo hard and were too tired to read. In them was no desire for words\r\nprinted upon paper. As they worked in the fields, vague, half-formed\r\nthoughts took possession of them. They believed in God and in God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npower to control their lives. In the little Protestant churches they\r\ngathered on Sunday to hear of God and his works. The churches were the\r\ncenter of the social and intellectual life of the times. The figure of\r\nGod was big in the hearts of men.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having been born an imaginative child and having within him a\r\ngreat intellectual eagerness, Jesse Bentley had turned wholeheartedly\r\ntoward God. When the war took his brothers away, he saw the hand of God\r\nin that. When his father became ill and could no longer attend to the\r\nrunning of the farm, he took that also as a sign from God. In the city,\r\nwhen the word came to him, he walked about at night through the streets\r\nthinking of the matter and when he had come home and had got the work\r\non the farm well under way, he went again at night to walk through the\r\nforests and over the low hills and to think of God.\r\n\r\nAs he walked the importance of his own figure in some divine plan grew\r\nin his mind. He grew avaricious and was impatient that the farm\r\ncontained only six hundred acres. Kneeling in a fence corner at the\r\nedge of some meadow, he sent his voice abroad into the silence and\r\nlooking up he saw the stars shining down at him.\r\n\r\nOne evening, some months after his father\xe2\x80\x99s death, and when his wife\r\nKatherine was expecting at any moment to be laid abed of childbirth,\r\nJesse left his house and went for a long walk. The Bentley farm was\r\nsituated in a tiny valley watered by Wine Creek, and Jesse walked along\r\nthe banks of the stream to the end of his own land and on through the\r\nfields of his neighbors. As he walked the valley broadened and then\r\nnarrowed again. Great open stretches of field and wood lay before him.\r\nThe moon came out from behind clouds, and, climbing a low hill, he sat\r\ndown to think.\r\n\r\nJesse thought that as the true servant of God the entire stretch of\r\ncountry through which he had walked should have come into his\r\npossession. He thought of his dead brothers and blamed them that they\r\nhad not worked harder and achieved more. Before him in the moonlight\r\nthe tiny stream ran down over stones, and he began to think of the men\r\nof old times who like himself had owned flocks and lands.\r\n\r\nA fantastic impulse, half fear, half greediness, took possession of\r\nJesse Bentley. He remembered how in the old Bible story the Lord had\r\nappeared to that other Jesse and told him to send his son David to\r\nwhere Saul and the men of Israel were fighting the Philistines in the\r\nValley of Elah. Into Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s mind came the conviction that all of the\r\nOhio farmers who owned land in the valley of Wine Creek were\r\nPhilistines and enemies of God. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere should come from among them one who, like Goliath the Philistine\r\nof Gath, could defeat me and take from me my possessions.\xe2\x80\x9d In fancy he\r\nfelt the sickening dread that he thought must have lain heavy on the\r\nheart of Saul before the coming of David. Jumping to his feet, he began\r\nto run through the night. As he ran he called to God. His voice carried\r\nfar over the low hills. \xe2\x80\x9cJehovah of Hosts,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9csend to me this\r\nnight out of the womb of Katherine, a son. Let Thy grace alight upon\r\nme. Send me a son to be called David who shall help me to pluck at last\r\nall of these lands out of the hands of the Philistines and turn them to\r\nThy service and to the building of Thy kingdom on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGODLINESS\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nDavid Hardy of Winesburg, Ohio, was the grandson of Jesse Bentley, the\r\nowner of Bentley farms. When he was twelve years old he went to the old\r\nBentley place to live. His mother, Louise Bentley, the girl who came\r\ninto the world on that night when Jesse ran through the fields crying\r\nto God that he be given a son, had grown to womanhood on the farm and\r\nhad married young John Hardy of Winesburg, who became a banker. Louise\r\nand her husband did not live happily together and everyone agreed that\r\nshe was to blame. She was a small woman with sharp grey eyes and black\r\nhair. From childhood she had been inclined to fits of temper and when\r\nnot angry she was often morose and silent. In Winesburg it was said\r\nthat she drank. Her husband, the banker, who was a careful, shrewd man,\r\ntried hard to make her happy. When he began to make money he bought for\r\nher a large brick house on Elm Street in Winesburg and he was the first\r\nman in that town to keep a manservant to drive his wife\xe2\x80\x99s carriage.\r\n\r\nBut Louise could not be made happy. She flew into half insane fits of\r\ntemper during which she was sometimes silent, sometimes noisy and\r\nquarrelsome. She swore and cried out in her anger. She got a knife from\r\nthe kitchen and threatened her husband\xe2\x80\x99s life. Once she deliberately\r\nset fire to the house, and often she hid herself away for days in her\r\nown room and would see no one. Her life, lived as a half recluse, gave\r\nrise to all sorts of stories concerning her. It was said that she took\r\ndrugs and that she hid herself away from people because she was often\r\nso under the influence of drink that her condition could not be\r\nconcealed. Sometimes on summer afternoons she came out of the house and\r\ngot into her carriage. Dismissing the driver she took the reins in her\r\nown hands and drove off at top speed through the streets. If a\r\npedestrian got in her way she drove straight ahead and the frightened\r\ncitizen had to escape as best he could. To the people of the town it\r\nseemed as though she wanted to run them down. When she had driven\r\nthrough several streets, tearing around corners and beating the horses\r\nwith the whip, she drove off into the country. On the country roads\r\nafter she had gotten out of sight of the houses she let the horses slow\r\ndown to a walk and her wild, reckless mood passed. She became\r\nthoughtful and muttered words. Sometimes tears came into her eyes. And\r\nthen when she came back into town she again drove furiously through the\r\nquiet streets. But for the influence of her husband and the respect he\r\ninspired in people\xe2\x80\x99s minds she would have been arrested more than once\r\nby the town marshal.\r\n\r\nYoung David Hardy grew up in the house with this woman and as can well\r\nbe imagined there was not much joy in his childhood. He was too young\r\nthen to have opinions of his own about people, but at times it was\r\ndifficult for him not to have very definite opinions about the woman\r\nwho was his mother. David was always a quiet, orderly boy and for a\r\nlong time was thought by the people of Winesburg to be something of a\r\ndullard. His eyes were brown and as a child he had a habit of looking\r\nat things and people a long time without appearing to see what he was\r\nlooking at. When he heard his mother spoken of harshly or when he\r\noverheard her berating his father, he was frightened and ran away to\r\nhide. Sometimes he could not find a hiding place and that confused him.\r\nTurning his face toward a tree or if he was indoors toward the wall, he\r\nclosed his eyes and tried not to think of anything. He had a habit of\r\ntalking aloud to himself, and early in life a spirit of quiet sadness\r\noften took possession of him.\r\n\r\nOn the occasions when David went to visit his grandfather on the\r\nBentley farm, he was altogether contented and happy. Often he wished\r\nthat he would never have to go back to town and once when he had come\r\nhome from the farm after a long visit, something happened that had a\r\nlasting effect on his mind.\r\n\r\nDavid had come back into town with one of the hired men. The man was in\r\na hurry to go about his own affairs and left the boy at the head of the\r\nstreet in which the Hardy house stood. It was early dusk of a fall\r\nevening and the sky was overcast with clouds. Something happened to\r\nDavid. He could not bear to go into the house where his mother and\r\nfather lived, and on an impulse he decided to run away from home. He\r\nintended to go back to the farm and to his grandfather, but lost his\r\nway and for hours he wandered weeping and frightened on country roads.\r\nIt started to rain and lightning flashed in the sky. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination was excited and he fancied that he could see and hear\r\nstrange things in the darkness. Into his mind came the conviction that\r\nhe was walking and running in some terrible void where no one had ever\r\nbeen before. The darkness about him seemed limitless. The sound of the\r\nwind blowing in trees was terrifying. When a team of horses approached\r\nalong the road in which he walked he was frightened and climbed a\r\nfence. Through a field he ran until he came into another road and\r\ngetting upon his knees felt of the soft ground with his fingers. But\r\nfor the figure of his grandfather, whom he was afraid he would never\r\nfind in the darkness, he thought the world must be altogether empty.\r\nWhen his cries were heard by a farmer who was walking home from town\r\nand he was brought back to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, he was so tired and\r\nexcited that he did not know what was happening to him.\r\n\r\nBy chance David\xe2\x80\x99s father knew that he had disappeared. On the street he\r\nhad met the farm hand from the Bentley place and knew of his son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn to town. When the boy did not come home an alarm was set up and\r\nJohn Hardy with several men of the town went to search the country. The\r\nreport that David had been kidnapped ran about through the streets of\r\nWinesburg. When he came home there were no lights in the house, but his\r\nmother appeared and clutched him eagerly in her arms. David thought she\r\nhad suddenly become another woman. He could not believe that so\r\ndelightful a thing had happened. With her own hands Louise Hardy bathed\r\nhis tired young body and cooked him food. She would not let him go to\r\nbed but, when he had put on his nightgown, blew out the lights and sat\r\ndown in a chair to hold him in her arms. For an hour the woman sat in\r\nthe darkness and held her boy. All the time she kept talking in a low\r\nvoice. David could not understand what had so changed her. Her\r\nhabitually dissatisfied face had become, he thought, the most peaceful\r\nand lovely thing he had ever seen. When he began to weep she held him\r\nmore and more tightly. On and on went her voice. It was not harsh or\r\nshrill as when she talked to her husband, but was like rain falling on\r\ntrees. Presently men began coming to the door to report that he had not\r\nbeen found, but she made him hide and be silent until she had sent them\r\naway. He thought it must be a game his mother and the men of the town\r\nwere playing with him and laughed joyously. Into his mind came the\r\nthought that his having been lost and frightened in the darkness was an\r\naltogether unimportant matter. He thought that he would have been\r\nwilling to go through the frightful experience a thousand times to be\r\nsure of finding at the end of the long black road a thing so lovely as\r\nhis mother had suddenly become.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of young David\xe2\x80\x99s boyhood he saw his mother but\r\nseldom and she became for him just a woman with whom he had once lived.\r\nStill he could not get her figure out of his mind and as he grew older\r\nit became more definite. When he was twelve years old he went to the\r\nBentley farm to live. Old Jesse came into town and fairly demanded that\r\nhe be given charge of the boy. The old man was excited and determined\r\non having his own way. He talked to John Hardy in the office of the\r\nWinesburg Savings Bank and then the two men went to the house on Elm\r\nStreet to talk with Louise. They both expected her to make trouble but\r\nwere mistaken. She was very quiet and when Jesse had explained his\r\nmission and had gone on at some length about the advantages to come\r\nthrough having the boy out of doors and in the quiet atmosphere of the\r\nold farmhouse, she nodded her head in approval. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an atmosphere\r\nnot corrupted by my presence,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply. Her shoulders shook\r\nand she seemed about to fly into a fit of temper. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a place for a\r\nman child, although it was never a place for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nnever wanted me there and of course the air of your house did me no\r\ngood. It was like poison in my blood but it will be different with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouise turned and went out of the room, leaving the two men to sit in\r\nembarrassed silence. As very often happened she later stayed in her\r\nroom for days. Even when the boy\xe2\x80\x99s clothes were packed and he was taken\r\naway she did not appear. The loss of her son made a sharp break in her\r\nlife and she seemed less inclined to quarrel with her husband. John\r\nHardy thought it had all turned out very well indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd so young David went to live in the Bentley farmhouse with Jesse.\r\nTwo of the old farmer\xe2\x80\x99s sisters were alive and still lived in the\r\nhouse. They were afraid of Jesse and rarely spoke when he was about.\r\nOne of the women who had been noted for her flaming red hair when she\r\nwas younger was a born mother and became the boy\xe2\x80\x99s caretaker. Every\r\nnight when he had gone to bed she went into his room and sat on the\r\nfloor until he fell asleep. When he became drowsy she became bold and\r\nwhispered things that he later thought he must have dreamed.\r\n\r\nHer soft low voice called him endearing names and he dreamed that his\r\nmother had come to him and that she had changed so that she was always\r\nas she had been that time after he ran away. He also grew bold and\r\nreaching out his hand stroked the face of the woman on the floor so\r\nthat she was ecstatically happy. Everyone in the old house became happy\r\nafter the boy went there. The hard insistent thing in Jesse Bentley\r\nthat had kept the people in the house silent and timid and that had\r\nnever been dispelled by the presence of the girl Louise was apparently\r\nswept away by the coming of the boy. It was as though God had relented\r\nand sent a son to the man.\r\n\r\nThe man who had proclaimed himself the only true servant of God in all\r\nthe valley of Wine Creek, and who had wanted God to send him a sign of\r\napproval by way of a son out of the womb of Katherine, began to think\r\nthat at last his prayers had been answered. Although he was at that\r\ntime only fifty-five years old he looked seventy and was worn out with\r\nmuch thinking and scheming. The effort he had made to extend his land\r\nholdings had been successful and there were few farms in the valley\r\nthat did not belong to him, but until David came he was a bitterly\r\ndisappointed man.\r\n\r\nThere were two influences at work in Jesse Bentley and all his life his\r\nmind had been a battleground for these influences. First there was the\r\nold thing in him. He wanted to be a man of God and a leader among men\r\nof God. His walking in the fields and through the forests at night had\r\nbrought him close to nature and there were forces in the passionately\r\nreligious man that ran out to the forces in nature. The disappointment\r\nthat had come to him when a daughter and not a son had been born to\r\nKatherine had fallen upon him like a blow struck by some unseen hand\r\nand the blow had somewhat softened his egotism. He still believed that\r\nGod might at any moment make himself manifest out of the winds or the\r\nclouds, but he no longer demanded such recognition. Instead he prayed\r\nfor it. Sometimes he was altogether doubtful and thought God had\r\ndeserted the world. He regretted the fate that had not let him live in\r\na simpler and sweeter time when at the beckoning of some strange cloud\r\nin the sky men left their lands and houses and went forth into the\r\nwilderness to create new races. While he worked night and day to make\r\nhis farms more productive and to extend his holdings of land, he\r\nregretted that he could not use his own restless energy in the building\r\nof temples, the slaying of unbelievers and in general in the work of\r\nglorifying God\xe2\x80\x99s name on earth.\r\n\r\nThat is what Jesse hungered for and then also he hungered for something\r\nelse. He had grown into maturity in America in the years after the\r\nCivil War and he, like all men of his time, had been touched by the\r\ndeep influences that were at work in the country during those years\r\nwhen modern industrialism was being born. He began to buy machines that\r\nwould permit him to do the work of the farms while employing fewer men\r\nand he sometimes thought that if he were a younger man he would give up\r\nfarming altogether and start a factory in Winesburg for the making of\r\nmachinery. Jesse formed the habit of reading newspapers and magazines.\r\nHe invented a machine for the making of fence out of wire. Faintly he\r\nrealized that the atmosphere of old times and places that he had always\r\ncultivated in his own mind was strange and foreign to the thing that\r\nwas growing up in the minds of others. The beginning of the most\r\nmaterialistic age in the history of the world, when wars would be\r\nfought without patriotism, when men would forget God and only pay\r\nattention to moral standards, when the will to power would replace the\r\nwill to serve and beauty would be well-nigh forgotten in the terrible\r\nheadlong rush of mankind toward the acquiring of possessions, was\r\ntelling its story to Jesse the man of God as it was to the men about\r\nhim. The greedy thing in him wanted to make money faster than it could\r\nbe made by tilling the land. More than once he went into Winesburg to\r\ntalk with his son-in-law John Hardy about it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a banker and you\r\nwill have chances I never had,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and his eyes shone. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nthinking about it all the time. Big things are going to be done in the\r\ncountry and there will be more money to be made than I ever dreamed of.\r\nYou get into it. I wish I were younger and had your chance.\xe2\x80\x9d Jesse\r\nBentley walked up and down in the bank office and grew more and more\r\nexcited as he talked. At one time in his life he had been threatened\r\nwith paralysis and his left side remained somewhat weakened. As he\r\ntalked his left eyelid twitched. Later when he drove back home and when\r\nnight came on and the stars came out it was harder to get back the old\r\nfeeling of a close and personal God who lived in the sky overhead and\r\nwho might at any moment reach out his hand, touch him on the shoulder,\r\nand appoint for him some heroic task to be done. Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s mind was fixed\r\nupon the things read in newspapers and magazines, on fortunes to be\r\nmade almost without effort by shrewd men who bought and sold. For him\r\nthe coming of the boy David did much to bring back with renewed force\r\nthe old faith and it seemed to him that God had at last looked with\r\nfavor upon him.\r\n\r\nAs for the boy on the farm, life began to reveal itself to him in a\r\nthousand new and delightful ways. The kindly attitude of all about him\r\nexpanded his quiet nature and he lost the half timid, hesitating manner\r\nhe had always had with his people. At night when he went to bed after a\r\nlong day of adventures in the stables, in the fields, or driving about\r\nfrom farm to farm with his grandfather, he wanted to embrace everyone\r\nin the house. If Sherley Bentley, the woman who came each night to sit\r\non the floor by his bedside, did not appear at once, he went to the\r\nhead of the stairs and shouted, his young voice ringing through the\r\nnarrow halls where for so long there had been a tradition of silence.\r\nIn the morning when he awoke and lay still in bed, the sounds that came\r\nin to him through the windows filled him with delight. He thought with\r\na shudder of the life in the house in Winesburg and of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nangry voice that had always made him tremble. There in the country all\r\nsounds were pleasant sounds. When he awoke at dawn the barnyard back of\r\nthe house also awoke. In the house people stirred about. Eliza\r\nStoughton the half-witted girl was poked in the ribs by a farm hand and\r\ngiggled noisily, in some distant field a cow bawled and was answered by\r\nthe cattle in the stables, and one of the farm hands spoke sharply to\r\nthe horse he was grooming by the stable door. David leaped out of bed\r\nand ran to a window. All of the people stirring about excited his mind,\r\nand he wondered what his mother was doing in the house in town.\r\n\r\nFrom the windows of his own room he could not see directly into the\r\nbarnyard where the farm hands had now all assembled to do the morning\r\nshores, but he could hear the voices of the men and the neighing of the\r\nhorses. When one of the men laughed, he laughed also. Leaning out at\r\nthe open window, he looked into an orchard where a fat sow wandered\r\nabout with a litter of tiny pigs at her heels. Every morning he counted\r\nthe pigs. \xe2\x80\x9cFour, five, six, seven,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, wetting his finger\r\nand making straight up and down marks on the window ledge. David ran to\r\nput on his trousers and shirt. A feverish desire to get out of doors\r\ntook possession of him. Every morning he made such a noise coming down\r\nstairs that Aunt Callie, the housekeeper, declared he was trying to\r\ntear the house down. When he had run through the long old house,\r\nshutting the doors behind him with a bang, he came into the barnyard\r\nand looked about with an amazed air of expectancy. It seemed to him\r\nthat in such a place tremendous things might have happened during the\r\nnight. The farm hands looked at him and laughed. Henry Strader, an old\r\nman who had been on the farm since Jesse came into possession and who\r\nbefore David\xe2\x80\x99s time had never been known to make a joke, made the same\r\njoke every morning. It amused David so that he laughed and clapped his\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, come here and look,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cGrandfather\r\nJesse\xe2\x80\x99s white mare has torn the black stocking she wears on her foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDay after day through the long summer, Jesse Bentley drove from farm to\r\nfarm up and down the valley of Wine Creek, and his grandson went with\r\nhim. They rode in a comfortable old phaeton drawn by the white horse.\r\nThe old man scratched his thin white beard and talked to himself of his\r\nplans for increasing the productiveness of the fields they visited and\r\nof God\xe2\x80\x99s part in the plans all men made. Sometimes he looked at David\r\nand smiled happily and then for a long time he appeared to forget the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s existence. More and more every day now his mind turned back again\r\nto the dreams that had filled his mind when he had first come out of\r\nthe city to live on the land. One afternoon he startled David by\r\nletting his dreams take entire possession of him. With the boy as a\r\nwitness, he went through a ceremony and brought about an accident that\r\nnearly destroyed the companionship that was growing up between them.\r\n\r\nJesse and his grandson were driving in a distant part of the valley\r\nsome miles from home. A forest came down to the road and through the\r\nforest Wine Creek wriggled its way over stones toward a distant river.\r\nAll the afternoon Jesse had been in a meditative mood and now he began\r\nto talk. His mind went back to the night when he had been frightened by\r\nthoughts of a giant that might come to rob and plunder him of his\r\npossessions, and again as on that night when he had run through the\r\nfields crying for a son, he became excited to the edge of insanity.\r\nStopping the horse he got out of the buggy and asked David to get out\r\nalso. The two climbed over a fence and walked along the bank of the\r\nstream. The boy paid no attention to the muttering of his grandfather,\r\nbut ran along beside him and wondered what was going to happen. When a\r\nrabbit jumped up and ran away through the woods, he clapped his hands\r\nand danced with delight. He looked at the tall trees and was sorry that\r\nhe was not a little animal to climb high in the air without being\r\nfrightened. Stooping, he picked up a small stone and threw it over the\r\nhead of his grandfather into a clump of bushes. \xe2\x80\x9cWake up, little\r\nanimal. Go and climb to the top of the trees,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in a shrill\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nJesse Bentley went along under the trees with his head bowed and with\r\nhis mind in a ferment. His earnestness affected the boy, who presently\r\nbecame silent and a little alarmed. Into the old man\xe2\x80\x99s mind had come\r\nthe notion that now he could bring from God a word or a sign out of the\r\nsky, that the presence of the boy and man on their knees in some lonely\r\nspot in the forest would make the miracle he had been waiting for\r\nalmost inevitable. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in just such a place as this that other\r\nDavid tended the sheep when his father came and told him to go down\r\nunto Saul,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nTaking the boy rather roughly by the shoulder, he climbed over a fallen\r\nlog and when he had come to an open place among the trees he dropped\r\nupon his knees and began to pray in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nA kind of terror he had never known before took possession of David.\r\nCrouching beneath a tree he watched the man on the ground before him\r\nand his own knees began to tremble. It seemed to him that he was in the\r\npresence not only of his grandfather but of someone else, someone who\r\nmight hurt him, someone who was not kindly but dangerous and brutal. He\r\nbegan to cry and reaching down picked up a small stick, which he held\r\ntightly gripped in his fingers. When Jesse Bentley, absorbed in his own\r\nidea, suddenly arose and advanced toward him, his terror grew until his\r\nwhole body shook. In the woods an intense silence seemed to lie over\r\neverything and suddenly out of the silence came the old man\xe2\x80\x99s harsh and\r\ninsistent voice. Gripping the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, Jesse turned his face to\r\nthe sky and shouted. The whole left side of his face twitched and his\r\nhand on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder twitched also. \xe2\x80\x9cMake a sign to me, God,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I stand with the boy David. Come down to me out of the sky\r\nand make Thy presence known to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a cry of fear, David turned and, shaking himself loose from the\r\nhands that held him, ran away through the forest. He did not believe\r\nthat the man who turned up his face and in a harsh voice shouted at the\r\nsky was his grandfather at all. The man did not look like his\r\ngrandfather. The conviction that something strange and terrible had\r\nhappened, that by some miracle a new and dangerous person had come into\r\nthe body of the kindly old man, took possession of him. On and on he\r\nran down the hillside, sobbing as he ran. When he fell over the roots\r\nof a tree and in falling struck his head, he arose and tried to run on\r\nagain. His head hurt so that presently he fell down and lay still, but\r\nit was only after Jesse had carried him to the buggy and he awoke to\r\nfind the old man\xe2\x80\x99s hand stroking his head tenderly that the terror left\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cTake me away. There is a terrible man back there in the woods,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe declared firmly, while Jesse looked away over the tops of the trees\r\nand again his lips cried out to God. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done that Thou dost\r\nnot approve of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered softly, saying the words over and over\r\nas he drove rapidly along the road with the boy\xe2\x80\x99s cut and bleeding head\r\nheld tenderly against his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURRENDER\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\nThe story of Louise Bentley, who became Mrs. John Hardy and lived with\r\nher husband in a brick house on Elm Street in Winesburg, is a story of\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nBefore such women as Louise can be understood and their lives made\r\nlivable, much will have to be done. Thoughtful books will have to be\r\nwritten and thoughtful lives lived by people about them.\r\n\r\nBorn of a delicate and overworked mother, and an impulsive, hard,\r\nimaginative father, who did not look with favor upon her coming into\r\nthe world, Louise was from childhood a neurotic, one of the race of\r\nover-sensitive women that in later days industrialism was to bring in\r\nsuch great numbers into the world.\r\n\r\nDuring her early years she lived on the Bentley farm, a silent, moody\r\nchild, wanting love more than anything else in the world and not\r\ngetting it. When she was fifteen she went to live in Winesburg with the\r\nfamily of Albert Hardy, who had a store for the sale of buggies and\r\nwagons, and who was a member of the town board of education.\r\n\r\nLouise went into town to be a student in the Winesburg High School and\r\nshe went to live at the Hardys\xe2\x80\x99 because Albert Hardy and her father\r\nwere friends.\r\n\r\nHardy, the vehicle merchant of Winesburg, like thousands of other men\r\nof his times, was an enthusiast on the subject of education. He had\r\nmade his own way in the world without learning got from books, but he\r\nwas convinced that had he but known books things would have gone better\r\nwith him. To everyone who came into his shop he talked of the matter,\r\nand in his own household he drove his family distracted by his constant\r\nharping on the subject.\r\n\r\nHe had two daughters and one son, John Hardy, and more than once the\r\ndaughters threatened to leave school altogether. As a matter of\r\nprinciple they did just enough work in their classes to avoid\r\npunishment. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate books and I hate anyone who likes books,\xe2\x80\x9d Harriet,\r\nthe younger of the two girls, declared passionately.\r\n\r\nIn Winesburg as on the farm Louise was not happy. For years she had\r\ndreamed of the time when she could go forth into the world, and she\r\nlooked upon the move into the Hardy household as a great step in the\r\ndirection of freedom. Always when she had thought of the matter, it had\r\nseemed to her that in town all must be gaiety and life, that there men\r\nand women must live happily and freely, giving and taking friendship\r\nand affection as one takes the feel of a wind on the cheek. After the\r\nsilence and the cheerlessness of life in the Bentley house, she dreamed\r\nof stepping forth into an atmosphere that was warm and pulsating with\r\nlife and reality. And in the Hardy household Louise might have got\r\nsomething of the thing for which she so hungered but for a mistake she\r\nmade when she had just come to town.\r\n\r\nLouise won the disfavor of the two Hardy girls, Mary and Harriet, by\r\nher application to her studies in school. She did not come to the house\r\nuntil the day when school was to begin and knew nothing of the feeling\r\nthey had in the matter. She was timid and during the first month made\r\nno acquaintances. Every Friday afternoon one of the hired men from the\r\nfarm drove into Winesburg and took her home for the week-end, so that\r\nshe did not spend the Saturday holiday with the town people. Because\r\nshe was embarrassed and lonely she worked constantly at her studies. To\r\nMary and Harriet, it seemed as though she tried to make trouble for\r\nthem by her proficiency. In her eagerness to appear well Louise wanted\r\nto answer every question put to the class by the teacher. She jumped up\r\nand down and her eyes flashed. Then when she had answered some question\r\nthe others in the class had been unable to answer, she smiled happily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, I have done it for you,\xe2\x80\x9d her eyes seemed to say. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need not\r\nbother about the matter. I will answer all questions. For the whole\r\nclass it will be easy while I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening after supper in the Hardy house, Albert Hardy began to\r\npraise Louise. One of the teachers had spoken highly of her and he was\r\ndelighted. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, again I have heard of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, looking hard at\r\nhis daughters and then turning to smile at Louise. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother of the\r\nteachers has told me of the good work Louise is doing. Everyone in\r\nWinesburg is telling me how smart she is. I am ashamed that they do not\r\nspeak so of my own girls.\xe2\x80\x9d Arising, the merchant marched about the room\r\nand lighted his evening cigar.\r\n\r\nThe two girls looked at each other and shook their heads wearily.\r\nSeeing their indifference the father became angry. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it is\r\nsomething for you two to be thinking about,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, glaring at them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a big change coming here in America and in learning is the\r\nonly hope of the coming generations. Louise is the daughter of a rich\r\nman but she is not ashamed to study. It should make you ashamed to see\r\nwhat she does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe merchant took his hat from a rack by the door and prepared to\r\ndepart for the evening. At the door he stopped and glared back. So\r\nfierce was his manner that Louise was frightened and ran upstairs to\r\nher own room. The daughters began to speak of their own affairs. \xe2\x80\x9cPay\r\nattention to me,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the merchant. \xe2\x80\x9cYour minds are lazy. Your\r\nindifference to education is affecting your characters. You will amount\r\nto nothing. Now mark what I say\xe2\x80\x94Louise will be so far ahead of you that\r\nyou will never catch up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distracted man went out of the house and into the street shaking\r\nwith wrath. He went along muttering words and swearing, but when he got\r\ninto Main Street his anger passed. He stopped to talk of the weather or\r\nthe crops with some other merchant or with a farmer who had come into\r\ntown and forgot his daughters altogether or, if he thought of them,\r\nonly shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, girls will be girls,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmuttered philosophically.\r\n\r\nIn the house when Louise came down into the room where the two girls\r\nsat, they would have nothing to do with her. One evening after she had\r\nbeen there for more than six weeks and was heartbroken because of the\r\ncontinued air of coldness with which she was always greeted, she burst\r\ninto tears. \xe2\x80\x9cShut up your crying and go back to your own room and to\r\nyour books,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary Hardy said sharply.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room occupied by Louise was on the second floor of the Hardy house,\r\nand her window looked out upon an orchard. There was a stove in the\r\nroom and every evening young John Hardy carried up an armful of wood\r\nand put it in a box that stood by the wall. During the second month\r\nafter she came to the house, Louise gave up all hope of getting on a\r\nfriendly footing with the Hardy girls and went to her own room as soon\r\nas the evening meal was at an end.\r\n\r\nHer mind began to play with thoughts of making friends with John Hardy.\r\nWhen he came into the room with the wood in his arms, she pretended to\r\nbe busy with her studies but watched him eagerly. When he had put the\r\nwood in the box and turned to go out, she put down her head and\r\nblushed. She tried to make talk but could say nothing, and after he had\r\ngone she was angry at herself for her stupidity.\r\n\r\nThe mind of the country girl became filled with the idea of drawing\r\nclose to the young man. She thought that in him might be found the\r\nquality she had all her life been seeking in people. It seemed to her\r\nthat between herself and all the other people in the world, a wall had\r\nbeen built up and that she was living just on the edge of some warm\r\ninner circle of life that must be quite open and understandable to\r\nothers. She became obsessed with the thought that it wanted but a\r\ncourageous act on her part to make all of her association with people\r\nsomething quite different, and that it was possible by such an act to\r\npass into a new life as one opens a door and goes into a room. Day and\r\nnight she thought of the matter, but although the thing she wanted so\r\nearnestly was something very warm and close it had as yet no conscious\r\nconnection with sex. It had not become that definite, and her mind had\r\nonly alighted upon the person of John Hardy because he was at hand and\r\nunlike his sisters had not been unfriendly to her.\r\n\r\nThe Hardy sisters, Mary and Harriet, were both older than Louise. In a\r\ncertain kind of knowledge of the world they were years older. They\r\nlived as all of the young women of Middle Western towns lived. In those\r\ndays young women did not go out of our towns to Eastern colleges and\r\nideas in regard to social classes had hardly begun to exist. A daughter\r\nof a laborer was in much the same social position as a daughter of a\r\nfarmer or a merchant, and there were no leisure classes. A girl was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d or she was \xe2\x80\x9cnot nice.\xe2\x80\x9d If a nice girl, she had a young man who\r\ncame to her house to see her on Sunday and on Wednesday evenings.\r\nSometimes she went with her young man to a dance or a church social. At\r\nother times she received him at the house and was given the use of the\r\nparlor for that purpose. No one intruded upon her. For hours the two\r\nsat behind closed doors. Sometimes the lights were turned low and the\r\nyoung man and woman embraced. Cheeks became hot and hair disarranged.\r\nAfter a year or two, if the impulse within them became strong and\r\ninsistent enough, they married.\r\n\r\nOne evening during her first winter in Winesburg, Louise had an\r\nadventure that gave a new impulse to her desire to break down the wall\r\nthat she thought stood between her and John Hardy. It was Wednesday and\r\nimmediately after the evening meal Albert Hardy put on his hat and went\r\naway. Young John brought the wood and put it in the box in Louise\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do work hard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said awkwardly, and then before\r\nshe could answer he also went away.\r\n\r\nLouise heard him go out of the house and had a mad desire to run after\r\nhim. Opening her window she leaned out and called softly, \xe2\x80\x9cJohn, dear\r\nJohn, come back, don\xe2\x80\x99t go away.\xe2\x80\x9d The night was cloudy and she could not\r\nsee far into the darkness, but as she waited she fancied she could hear\r\na soft little noise as of someone going on tiptoes through the trees in\r\nthe orchard. She was frightened and closed the window quickly. For an\r\nhour she moved about the room trembling with excitement and when she\r\ncould not longer bear the waiting, she crept into the hall and down the\r\nstairs into a closet-like room that opened off the parlor.\r\n\r\nLouise had decided that she would perform the courageous act that had\r\nfor weeks been in her mind. She was convinced that John Hardy had\r\nconcealed himself in the orchard beneath her window and she was\r\ndetermined to find him and tell him that she wanted him to come close\r\nto her, to hold her in his arms, to tell her of his thoughts and dreams\r\nand to listen while she told him her thoughts and dreams. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\ndarkness it will be easier to say things,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to herself, as\r\nshe stood in the little room groping for the door.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly Louise realized that she was not alone in the house.\r\nIn the parlor on the other side of the door a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice spoke softly\r\nand the door opened. Louise just had time to conceal herself in a\r\nlittle opening beneath the stairway when Mary Hardy, accompanied by her\r\nyoung man, came into the little dark room.\r\n\r\nFor an hour Louise sat on the floor in the darkness and listened.\r\nWithout words Mary Hardy, with the aid of the man who had come to spend\r\nthe evening with her, brought to the country girl a knowledge of men\r\nand women. Putting her head down until she was curled into a little\r\nball she lay perfectly still. It seemed to her that by some strange\r\nimpulse of the gods, a great gift had been brought to Mary Hardy and\r\nshe could not understand the older woman\xe2\x80\x99s determined protest.\r\n\r\nThe young man took Mary Hardy into his arms and kissed her. When she\r\nstruggled and laughed, he but held her the more tightly. For an hour\r\nthe contest between them went on and then they went back into the\r\nparlor and Louise escaped up the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you were quiet out\r\nthere. You must not disturb the little mouse at her studies,\xe2\x80\x9d she heard\r\nHarriet saying to her sister as she stood by her own door in the\r\nhallway above.\r\n\r\nLouise wrote a note to John Hardy and late that night, when all in the\r\nhouse were asleep, she crept downstairs and slipped it under his door.\r\nShe was afraid that if she did not do the thing at once her courage\r\nwould fail. In the note she tried to be quite definite about what she\r\nwanted. \xe2\x80\x9cI want someone to love me and I want to love someone,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are the one for me I want you to come into the orchard\r\nat night and make a noise under my window. It will be easy for me to\r\ncrawl down over the shed and come to you. I am thinking about it all\r\nthe time, so if you are to come at all you must come soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a long time Louise did not know what would be the outcome of her\r\nbold attempt to secure for herself a lover. In a way she still did not\r\nknow whether or not she wanted him to come. Sometimes it seemed to her\r\nthat to be held tightly and kissed was the whole secret of life, and\r\nthen a new impulse came and she was terribly afraid. The age-old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s desire to be possessed had taken possession of her, but so\r\nvague was her notion of life that it seemed to her just the touch of\r\nJohn Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s hand upon her own hand would satisfy. She wondered if he\r\nwould understand that. At the table next day while Albert Hardy talked\r\nand the two girls whispered and laughed, she did not look at John but\r\nat the table and as soon as possible escaped. In the evening she went\r\nout of the house until she was sure he had taken the wood to her room\r\nand gone away. When after several evenings of intense listening she\r\nheard no call from the darkness in the orchard, she was half beside\r\nherself with grief and decided that for her there was no way to break\r\nthrough the wall that had shut her off from the joy of life.\r\n\r\nAnd then on a Monday evening two or three weeks after the writing of\r\nthe note, John Hardy came for her. Louise had so entirely given up the\r\nthought of his coming that for a long time she did not hear the call\r\nthat came up from the orchard. On the Friday evening before, as she was\r\nbeing driven back to the farm for the week-end by one of the hired men,\r\nshe had on an impulse done a thing that had startled her, and as John\r\nHardy stood in the darkness below and called her name softly and\r\ninsistently, she walked about in her room and wondered what new impulse\r\nhad led her to commit so ridiculous an act.\r\n\r\nThe farm hand, a young fellow with black curly hair, had come for her\r\nsomewhat late on that Friday evening and they drove home in the\r\ndarkness. Louise, whose mind was filled with thoughts of John Hardy,\r\ntried to make talk but the country boy was embarrassed and would say\r\nnothing. Her mind began to review the loneliness of her childhood and\r\nshe remembered with a pang the sharp new loneliness that had just come\r\nto her. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried suddenly, and then broke forth\r\ninto a tirade that frightened her escort. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate father and the old\r\nman Hardy, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cI get my lessons there in\r\nthe school in town but I hate that also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouise frightened the farm hand still more by turning and putting her\r\ncheek down upon his shoulder. Vaguely she hoped that he like that young\r\nman who had stood in the darkness with Mary would put his arms about\r\nher and kiss her, but the country boy was only alarmed. He struck the\r\nhorse with the whip and began to whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cThe road is rough, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid loudly. Louise was so angry that reaching up she snatched his hat\r\nfrom his head and threw it into the road. When he jumped out of the\r\nbuggy and went to get it, she drove off and left him to walk the rest\r\nof the way back to the farm.\r\n\r\nLouise Bentley took John Hardy to be her lover. That was not what she\r\nwanted but it was so the young man had interpreted her approach to him,\r\nand so anxious was she to achieve something else that she made no\r\nresistance. When after a few months they were both afraid that she was\r\nabout to become a mother, they went one evening to the county seat and\r\nwere married. For a few months they lived in the Hardy house and then\r\ntook a house of their own. All during the first year Louise tried to\r\nmake her husband understand the vague and intangible hunger that had\r\nled to the writing of the note and that was still unsatisfied. Again\r\nand again she crept into his arms and tried to talk of it, but always\r\nwithout success. Filled with his own notions of love between men and\r\nwomen, he did not listen but began to kiss her upon the lips. That\r\nconfused her so that in the end she did not want to be kissed. She did\r\nnot know what she wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen the alarm that had tricked them into marriage proved to be\r\ngroundless, she was angry and said bitter, hurtful things. Later when\r\nher son David was born, she could not nurse him and did not know\r\nwhether she wanted him or not. Sometimes she stayed in the room with\r\nhim all day, walking about and occasionally creeping close to touch him\r\ntenderly with her hands, and then other days came when she did not want\r\nto see or be near the tiny bit of humanity that had come into the\r\nhouse. When John Hardy reproached her for her cruelty, she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis a man child and will get what it wants anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad it been a woman child there is nothing in the world I would not\r\nhave done for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERROR\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\nWhen David Hardy was a tall boy of fifteen, he, like his mother, had an\r\nadventure that changed the whole current of his life and sent him out\r\nof his quiet corner into the world. The shell of the circumstances of\r\nhis life was broken and he was compelled to start forth. He left\r\nWinesburg and no one there ever saw him again. After his disappearance,\r\nhis mother and grandfather both died and his father became very rich.\r\nHe spent much money in trying to locate his son, but that is no part of\r\nthis story.\r\n\r\nIt was in the late fall of an unusual year on the Bentley farms.\r\nEverywhere the crops had been heavy. That spring, Jesse had bought part\r\nof a long strip of black swamp land that lay in the valley of Wine\r\nCreek. He got the land at a low price but had spent a large sum of\r\nmoney to improve it. Great ditches had to be dug and thousands of tile\r\nlaid. Neighboring farmers shook their heads over the expense. Some of\r\nthem laughed and hoped that Jesse would lose heavily by the venture,\r\nbut the old man went silently on with the work and said nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the land was drained he planted it to cabbages and onions, and\r\nagain the neighbors laughed. The crop was, however, enormous and\r\nbrought high prices. In the one year Jesse made enough money to pay for\r\nall the cost of preparing the land and had a surplus that enabled him\r\nto buy two more farms. He was exultant and could not conceal his\r\ndelight. For the first time in all the history of his ownership of the\r\nfarms, he went among his men with a smiling face.\r\n\r\nJesse bought a great many new machines for cutting down the cost of\r\nlabor and all of the remaining acres in the strip of black fertile\r\nswamp land. One day he went into Winesburg and bought a bicycle and a\r\nnew suit of clothes for David and he gave his two sisters money with\r\nwhich to go to a religious convention at Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of that year when the frost came and the trees in the\r\nforests along Wine Creek were golden brown, David spent every moment\r\nwhen he did not have to attend school, out in the open. Alone or with\r\nother boys he went every afternoon into the woods to gather nuts. The\r\nother boys of the countryside, most of them sons of laborers on the\r\nBentley farms, had guns with which they went hunting rabbits and\r\nsquirrels, but David did not go with them. He made himself a sling with\r\nrubber bands and a forked stick and went off by himself to gather nuts.\r\nAs he went about thoughts came to him. He realized that he was almost a\r\nman and wondered what he would do in life, but before they came to\r\nanything, the thoughts passed and he was a boy again. One day he killed\r\na squirrel that sat on one of the lower branches of a tree and\r\nchattered at him. Home he ran with the squirrel in his hand. One of the\r\nBentley sisters cooked the little animal and he ate it with great\r\ngusto. The skin he tacked on a board and suspended the board by a\r\nstring from his bedroom window.\r\n\r\nThat gave his mind a new turn. After that he never went into the woods\r\nwithout carrying the sling in his pocket and he spent hours shooting at\r\nimaginary animals concealed among the brown leaves in the trees.\r\nThoughts of his coming manhood passed and he was content to be a boy\r\nwith a boy\xe2\x80\x99s impulses.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday morning when he was about to set off for the woods with\r\nthe sling in his pocket and a bag for nuts on his shoulder, his\r\ngrandfather stopped him. In the eyes of the old man was the strained\r\nserious look that always a little frightened David. At such times Jesse\r\nBentley\xe2\x80\x99s eyes did not look straight ahead but wavered and seemed to be\r\nlooking at nothing. Something like an invisible curtain appeared to\r\nhave come between the man and all the rest of the world. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to\r\ncome with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said briefly, and his eyes looked over the boy\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\ninto the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have something important to do today. You may bring\r\nthe bag for nuts if you wish. It does not matter and anyway we will be\r\ngoing into the woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJesse and David set out from the Bentley farmhouse in the old phaeton\r\nthat was drawn by the white horse. When they had gone along in silence\r\nfor a long way they stopped at the edge of a field where a flock of\r\nsheep were grazing. Among the sheep was a lamb that had been born out\r\nof season, and this David and his grandfather caught and tied so\r\ntightly that it looked like a little white ball. When they drove on\r\nagain Jesse let David hold the lamb in his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw it yesterday\r\nand it put me in mind of what I have long wanted to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and\r\nagain he looked away over the head of the boy with the wavering,\r\nuncertain stare in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter the feeling of exaltation that had come to the farmer as a result\r\nof his successful year, another mood had taken possession of him. For a\r\nlong time he had been going about feeling very humble and prayerful.\r\nAgain he walked alone at night thinking of God and as he walked he\r\nagain connected his own figure with the figures of old days. Under the\r\nstars he knelt on the wet grass and raised up his voice in prayer. Now\r\nhe had decided that like the men whose stories filled the pages of the\r\nBible, he would make a sacrifice to God. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been given these\r\nabundant crops and God has also sent me a boy who is called David,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I should have done this thing long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe was sorry the idea had not come into his mind in the days before his\r\ndaughter Louise had been born and thought that surely now when he had\r\nerected a pile of burning sticks in some lonely place in the woods and\r\nhad offered the body of a lamb as a burnt offering, God would appear to\r\nhim and give him a message.\r\n\r\nMore and more as he thought of the matter, he thought also of David and\r\nhis passionate self-love was partially forgotten. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for the\r\nboy to begin thinking of going out into the world and the message will\r\nbe one concerning him,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided. \xe2\x80\x9cGod will make a pathway for him.\r\nHe will tell me what place David is to take in life and when he shall\r\nset out on his journey. It is right that the boy should be there. If I\r\nam fortunate and an angel of God should appear, David will see the\r\nbeauty and glory of God made manifest to man. It will make a true man\r\nof God of him also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn silence Jesse and David drove along the road until they came to that\r\nplace where Jesse had once before appealed to God and had frightened\r\nhis grandson. The morning had been bright and cheerful, but a cold wind\r\nnow began to blow and clouds hid the sun. When David saw the place to\r\nwhich they had come he began to tremble with fright, and when they\r\nstopped by the bridge where the creek came down from among the trees,\r\nhe wanted to spring out of the phaeton and run away.\r\n\r\nA dozen plans for escape ran through David\xe2\x80\x99s head, but when Jesse\r\nstopped the horse and climbed over the fence into the wood, he\r\nfollowed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is foolish to be afraid. Nothing will happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he told\r\nhimself as he went along with the lamb in his arms. There was something\r\nin the helplessness of the little animal held so tightly in his arms\r\nthat gave him courage. He could feel the rapid beating of the beast\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart and that made his own heart beat less rapidly. As he walked\r\nswiftly along behind his grandfather, he untied the string with which\r\nthe four legs of the lamb were fastened together. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything happens\r\nwe will run away together,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nIn the woods, after they had gone a long way from the road, Jesse\r\nstopped in an opening among the trees where a clearing, overgrown with\r\nsmall bushes, ran up from the creek. He was still silent but began at\r\nonce to erect a heap of dry sticks which he presently set afire. The\r\nboy sat on the ground with the lamb in his arms. His imagination began\r\nto invest every movement of the old man with significance and he became\r\nevery moment more afraid. \xe2\x80\x9cI must put the blood of the lamb on the head\r\nof the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Jesse muttered when the sticks had begun to blaze\r\ngreedily, and taking a long knife from his pocket he turned and walked\r\nrapidly across the clearing toward David.\r\n\r\nTerror seized upon the soul of the boy. He was sick with it. For a\r\nmoment he sat perfectly still and then his body stiffened and he sprang\r\nto his feet. His face became as white as the fleece of the lamb that,\r\nnow finding itself suddenly released, ran down the hill. David ran\r\nalso. Fear made his feet fly. Over the low bushes and logs he leaped\r\nfrantically. As he ran he put his hand into his pocket and took out the\r\nbranched stick from which the sling for shooting squirrels was\r\nsuspended. When he came to the creek that was shallow and splashed down\r\nover the stones, he dashed into the water and turned to look back, and\r\nwhen he saw his grandfather still running toward him with the long\r\nknife held tightly in his hand he did not hesitate, but reaching down,\r\nselected a stone and put it in the sling. With all his strength he drew\r\nback the heavy rubber bands and the stone whistled through the air. It\r\nhit Jesse, who had entirely forgotten the boy and was pursuing the\r\nlamb, squarely in the head. With a groan he pitched forward and fell\r\nalmost at the boy\xe2\x80\x99s feet. When David saw that he lay still and that he\r\nwas apparently dead, his fright increased immeasurably. It became an\r\ninsane panic.\r\n\r\nWith a cry he turned and ran off through the woods weeping\r\nconvulsively. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94I killed him, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he sobbed.\r\nAs he ran on and on he decided suddenly that he would never go back\r\nagain to the Bentley farms or to the town of Winesburg. \xe2\x80\x9cI have killed\r\nthe man of God and now I will myself be a man and go into the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said stoutly as he stopped running and walked rapidly down a road\r\nthat followed the windings of Wine Creek as it ran through fields and\r\nforests into the west.\r\n\r\nOn the ground by the creek Jesse Bentley moved uneasily about. He\r\ngroaned and opened his eyes. For a long time he lay perfectly still and\r\nlooked at the sky. When at last he got to his feet, his mind was\r\nconfused and he was not surprised by the boy\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance. By the\r\nroadside he sat down on a log and began to talk about God. That is all\r\nthey ever got out of him. Whenever David\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned he looked\r\nvaguely at the sky and said that a messenger from God had taken the\r\nboy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt happened because I was too greedy for glory,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, and\r\nwould have no more to say in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN OF IDEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe lived with his mother, a grey, silent woman with a peculiar ashy\r\ncomplexion. The house in which they lived stood in a little grove of\r\ntrees beyond where the main street of Winesburg crossed Wine Creek. His\r\nname was Joe Welling, and his father had been a man of some dignity in\r\nthe community, a lawyer, and a member of the state legislature at\r\nColumbus. Joe himself was small of body and in his character unlike\r\nanyone else in town. He was like a tiny little volcano that lies silent\r\nfor days and then suddenly spouts fire. No, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like that\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nlike a man who is subject to fits, one who walks among his fellow men\r\ninspiring fear because a fit may come upon him suddenly and blow him\r\naway into a strange uncanny physical state in which his eyes roll and\r\nhis legs and arms jerk. He was like that, only that the visitation that\r\ndescended upon Joe Welling was a mental and not a physical thing. He\r\nwas beset by ideas and in the throes of one of his ideas was\r\nuncontrollable. Words rolled and tumbled from his mouth. A peculiar\r\nsmile came upon his lips. The edges of his teeth that were tipped with\r\ngold glistened in the light. Pouncing upon a bystander he began to\r\ntalk. For the bystander there was no escape. The excited man breathed\r\ninto his face, peered into his eyes, pounded upon his chest with a\r\nshaking forefinger, demanded, compelled attention.\r\n\r\nIn those days the Standard Oil Company did not deliver oil to the\r\nconsumer in big wagons and motor trucks as it does now, but delivered\r\ninstead to retail grocers, hardware stores, and the like. Joe was the\r\nStandard Oil agent in Winesburg and in several towns up and down the\r\nrailroad that went through Winesburg. He collected bills, booked\r\norders, and did other things. His father, the legislator, had secured\r\nthe job for him.\r\n\r\nIn and out of the stores of Winesburg went Joe Welling\xe2\x80\x94silent,\r\nexcessively polite, intent upon his business. Men watched him with eyes\r\nin which lurked amusement tempered by alarm. They were waiting for him\r\nto break forth, preparing to flee. Although the seizures that came upon\r\nhim were harmless enough, they could not be laughed away. They were\r\noverwhelming. Astride an idea, Joe was overmastering. His personality\r\nbecame gigantic. It overrode the man to whom he talked, swept him away,\r\nswept all away, all who stood within sound of his voice.\r\n\r\nIn Sylvester West\xe2\x80\x99s Drug Store stood four men who were talking of horse\r\nracing. Wesley Moyer\xe2\x80\x99s stallion, Tony Tip, was to race at the June\r\nmeeting at Tiffin, Ohio, and there was a rumor that he would meet the\r\nstiffest competition of his career. It was said that Pop Geers, the\r\ngreat racing driver, would himself be there. A doubt of the success of\r\nTony Tip hung heavy in the air of Winesburg.\r\n\r\nInto the drug store came Joe Welling, brushing the screen door\r\nviolently aside. With a strange absorbed light in his eyes he pounced\r\nupon Ed Thomas, he who knew Pop Geers and whose opinion of Tony Tip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchances was worth considering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe water is up in Wine Creek,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe Welling with the air of\r\nPheidippides bringing news of the victory of the Greeks in the struggle\r\nat Marathon. His finger beat a tattoo upon Ed Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s broad chest. \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nTrunion bridge it is within eleven and a half inches of the flooring,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe went on, the words coming quickly and with a little whistling noise\r\nfrom between his teeth. An expression of helpless annoyance crept over\r\nthe faces of the four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my facts correct. Depend upon that. I went to Sinnings\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHardware Store and got a rule. Then I went back and measured. I could\r\nhardly believe my own eyes. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t rained you see for ten days. At\r\nfirst I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think. Thoughts rushed through my head. I\r\nthought of subterranean passages and springs. Down under the ground\r\nwent my mind, delving about. I sat on the floor of the bridge and\r\nrubbed my head. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a cloud in the sky, not one. Come out into\r\nthe street and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a cloud. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a cloud\r\nnow. Yes, there was a cloud. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to keep back any facts. There\r\nwas a cloud in the west down near the horizon, a cloud no bigger than a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I think that has anything to do with it. There it is, you\r\nsee. You understand how puzzled I was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen an idea came to me. I laughed. You\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh, too. Of course it\r\nrained over in Medina County. That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting, eh? If we had no\r\ntrains, no mails, no telegraph, we would know that it rained over in\r\nMedina County. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Wine Creek comes from. Everyone knows that.\r\nLittle old Wine Creek brought us the news. That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. I\r\nlaughed. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe Welling turned and went out at the door. Taking a book from his\r\npocket, he stopped and ran a finger down one of the pages. Again he was\r\nabsorbed in his duties as agent of the Standard Oil Company. \xe2\x80\x9cHern\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGrocery will be getting low on coal oil. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see them,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered,\r\nhurrying along the street, and bowing politely to the right and left at\r\nthe people walking past.\r\n\r\nWhen George Willard went to work for the _Winesburg Eagle_ he was\r\nbesieged by Joe Welling. Joe envied the boy. It seemed to him that he\r\nwas meant by Nature to be a reporter on a newspaper. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is what I\r\nshould be doing, there is no doubt of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, stopping\r\nGeorge Willard on the sidewalk before Daugherty\xe2\x80\x99s Feed Store. His eyes\r\nbegan to glisten and his forefinger to tremble. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I make more\r\nmoney with the Standard Oil Company and I\xe2\x80\x99m only telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing against you but I should have your place. I\r\ncould do the work at odd moments. Here and there I would run finding\r\nout things you\xe2\x80\x99ll never see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBecoming more excited Joe Welling crowded the young reporter against\r\nthe front of the feed store. He appeared to be lost in thought, rolling\r\nhis eyes about and running a thin nervous hand through his hair. A\r\nsmile spread over his face and his gold teeth glittered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get out\r\nyour note book,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou carry a little pad of paper in your\r\npocket, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I knew you did. Well, you set this down. I thought\r\nof it the other day. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take decay. Now what is decay? It\xe2\x80\x99s fire. It\r\nburns up wood and other things. You never thought of that? Of course\r\nnot. This sidewalk here and this feed store, the trees down the street\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re all on fire. They\xe2\x80\x99re burning up. Decay you see is always\r\ngoing on. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop. Water and paint can\xe2\x80\x99t stop it. If a thing is\r\niron, then what? It rusts, you see. That\xe2\x80\x99s fire, too. The world is on\r\nfire. Start your pieces in the paper that way. Just say in big letters\r\n_\xe2\x80\x98The World Is On Fire.\xe2\x80\x99_ That will make \xe2\x80\x99em look up. They\xe2\x80\x99ll say\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a smart one. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I don\xe2\x80\x99t envy you. I just snatched\r\nthat idea out of the air. I would make a newspaper hum. You got to\r\nadmit that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning quickly, Joe Welling walked rapidly away. When he had taken\r\nseveral steps he stopped and looked back. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to make you a regular hummer. I should start a\r\nnewspaper myself, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I should do. I\xe2\x80\x99d be a marvel. Everybody\r\nknows that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen George Willard had been for a year on the _Winesburg Eagle_, four\r\nthings happened to Joe Welling. His mother died, he came to live at the\r\nNew Willard House, he became involved in a love affair, and he\r\norganized the Winesburg Baseball Club.\r\n\r\nJoe organized the baseball club because he wanted to be a coach and in\r\nthat position he began to win the respect of his townsmen. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a\r\nwonder,\xe2\x80\x9d they declared after Joe\xe2\x80\x99s team had whipped the team from\r\nMedina County. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gets everybody working together. You just watch\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon the baseball field Joe Welling stood by first base, his whole body\r\nquivering with excitement. In spite of themselves all the players\r\nwatched him closely. The opposing pitcher became confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow! Now! Now! Now!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the excited man. \xe2\x80\x9cWatch me! Watch me!\r\nWatch my fingers! Watch my hands! Watch my feet! Watch my eyes! Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork together here! Watch me! In me you see all the movements of the\r\ngame! Work with me! Work with me! Watch me! Watch me! Watch me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith runners of the Winesburg team on bases, Joe Welling became as one\r\ninspired. Before they knew what had come over them, the base runners\r\nwere watching the man, edging off the bases, advancing, retreating,\r\nheld as by an invisible cord. The players of the opposing team also\r\nwatched Joe. They were fascinated. For a moment they watched and then,\r\nas though to break a spell that hung over them, they began hurling the\r\nball wildly about, and amid a series of fierce animal-like cries from\r\nthe coach, the runners of the Winesburg team scampered home.\r\n\r\nJoe Welling\xe2\x80\x99s love affair set the town of Winesburg on edge. When it\r\nbegan everyone whispered and shook his head. When people tried to\r\nlaugh, the laughter was forced and unnatural. Joe fell in love with\r\nSarah King, a lean, sad-looking woman who lived with her father and\r\nbrother in a brick house that stood opposite the gate leading to the\r\nWinesburg Cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe two Kings, Edward the father, and Tom the son, were not popular in\r\nWinesburg. They were called proud and dangerous. They had come to\r\nWinesburg from some place in the South and ran a cider mill on the\r\nTrunion Pike. Tom King was reported to have killed a man before he came\r\nto Winesburg. He was twenty-seven years old and rode about town on a\r\ngrey pony. Also he had a long yellow mustache that dropped down over\r\nhis teeth, and always carried a heavy, wicked-looking walking stick in\r\nhis hand. Once he killed a dog with the stick. The dog belonged to Win\r\nPawsey, the shoe merchant, and stood on the sidewalk wagging its tail.\r\nTom King killed it with one blow. He was arrested and paid a fine of\r\nten dollars.\r\n\r\nOld Edward King was small of stature and when he passed people in the\r\nstreet laughed a queer unmirthful laugh. When he laughed he scratched\r\nhis left elbow with his right hand. The sleeve of his coat was almost\r\nworn through from the habit. As he walked along the street, looking\r\nnervously about and laughing, he seemed more dangerous than his silent,\r\nfierce-looking son.\r\n\r\nWhen Sarah King began walking out in the evening with Joe Welling,\r\npeople shook their heads in alarm. She was tall and pale and had dark\r\nrings under her eyes. The couple looked ridiculous together. Under the\r\ntrees they walked and Joe talked. His passionate eager protestations of\r\nlove, heard coming out of the darkness by the cemetery wall, or from\r\nthe deep shadows of the trees on the hill that ran up to the Fair\r\nGrounds from Waterworks Pond, were repeated in the stores. Men stood by\r\nthe bar in the New Willard House laughing and talking of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourtship. After the laughter came the silence. The Winesburg baseball\r\nteam, under his management, was winning game after game, and the town\r\nhad begun to respect him. Sensing a tragedy, they waited, laughing\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\nLate on a Saturday afternoon the meeting between Joe Welling and the\r\ntwo Kings, the anticipation of which had set the town on edge, took\r\nplace in Joe Welling\xe2\x80\x99s room in the New Willard House. George Willard\r\nwas a witness to the meeting. It came about in this way:\r\n\r\nWhen the young reporter went to his room after the evening meal he saw\r\nTom King and his father sitting in the half darkness in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s room. The\r\nson had the heavy walking stick in his hand and sat near the door. Old\r\nEdward King walked nervously about, scratching his left elbow with his\r\nright hand. The hallways were empty and silent.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard went to his own room and sat down at his desk. He tried\r\nto write but his hand trembled so that he could not hold the pen. He\r\nalso walked nervously up and down. Like the rest of the town of\r\nWinesburg he was perplexed and knew not what to do.\r\n\r\nIt was seven-thirty and fast growing dark when Joe Welling came along\r\nthe station platform toward the New Willard House. In his arms he held\r\na bundle of weeds and grasses. In spite of the terror that made his\r\nbody shake, George Willard was amused at the sight of the small spry\r\nfigure holding the grasses and half running along the platform.\r\n\r\nShaking with fright and anxiety, the young reporter lurked in the\r\nhallway outside the door of the room in which Joe Welling talked to the\r\ntwo Kings. There had been an oath, the nervous giggle of old Edward\r\nKing, and then silence. Now the voice of Joe Welling, sharp and clear,\r\nbroke forth. George Willard began to laugh. He understood. As he had\r\nswept all men before him, so now Joe Welling was carrying the two men\r\nin the room off their feet with a tidal wave of words. The listener in\r\nthe hall walked up and down, lost in amazement.\r\n\r\nInside the room Joe Welling had paid no attention to the grumbled\r\nthreat of Tom King. Absorbed in an idea he closed the door and,\r\nlighting a lamp, spread the handful of weeds and grasses upon the\r\nfloor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got something here,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was going\r\nto tell George Willard about it, let him make a piece out of it for the\r\npaper. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re here. I wish Sarah were here also. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ngoing to come to your house and tell you of some of my ideas. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ninteresting. Sarah wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me. She said we\xe2\x80\x99d quarrel. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRunning up and down before the two perplexed men, Joe Welling began to\r\nexplain. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you make a mistake now,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is something\r\nbig.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was shrill with excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just follow me, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe interested. I know you will. Suppose this\xe2\x80\x94suppose all of the wheat,\r\nthe corn, the oats, the peas, the potatoes, were all by some miracle\r\nswept away. Now here we are, you see, in this county. There is a high\r\nfence built all around us. We\xe2\x80\x99ll suppose that. No one can get over the\r\nfence and all the fruits of the earth are destroyed, nothing left but\r\nthese wild things, these grasses. Would we be done for? I ask you that.\r\nWould we be done for?\xe2\x80\x9d Again Tom King growled and for a moment there\r\nwas silence in the room. Then again Joe plunged into the exposition of\r\nhis idea. \xe2\x80\x9cThings would go hard for a time. I admit that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nadmit that. No getting around it. We\xe2\x80\x99d be hard put to it. More than one\r\nfat stomach would cave in. But they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t down us. I should say\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom King laughed good naturedly and the shivery, nervous laugh of\r\nEdward King rang through the house. Joe Welling hurried on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbegin, you see, to breed up new vegetables and fruits. Soon we\xe2\x80\x99d regain\r\nall we had lost. Mind, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say the new things would be the same as\r\nthe old. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99d be better, maybe not so good.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s interesting, eh? You can think about that. It starts your mind\r\nworking, now don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the room there was silence and then again old Edward King laughed\r\nnervously. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, I wish Sarah was here,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe Welling. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go\r\nup to your house. I want to tell her of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a scraping of chairs in the room. It was then that George\r\nWillard retreated to his own room. Leaning out at the window he saw Joe\r\nWelling going along the street with the two Kings. Tom King was forced\r\nto take extraordinary long strides to keep pace with the little man. As\r\nhe strode along, he leaned over, listening\xe2\x80\x94absorbed, fascinated. Joe\r\nWelling again talked excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cTake milkweed now,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot\r\nmight be done with milkweed, eh? It\xe2\x80\x99s almost unbelievable. I want you\r\nto think about it. I want you two to think about it. There would be a\r\nnew vegetable kingdom you see. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting, eh? It\xe2\x80\x99s an idea. Wait\r\ntill you see Sarah, she\xe2\x80\x99ll get the idea. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be interested. Sarah is\r\nalways interested in ideas. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be too smart for Sarah, now can\r\nyou? Of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t. You know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice Hindman, a woman of twenty-seven when George Willard was a mere\r\nboy, had lived in Winesburg all her life. She clerked in Winney\xe2\x80\x99s Dry\r\nGoods Store and lived with her mother, who had married a second\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nAlice\xe2\x80\x99s step-father was a carriage painter, and given to drink. His\r\nstory is an odd one. It will be worth telling some day.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-seven Alice was tall and somewhat slight. Her head was large\r\nand overshadowed her body. Her shoulders were a little stooped and her\r\nhair and eyes brown. She was very quiet but beneath a placid exterior a\r\ncontinual ferment went on.\r\n\r\nWhen she was a girl of sixteen and before she began to work in the\r\nstore, Alice had an affair with a young man. The young man, named Ned\r\nCurrie, was older than Alice. He, like George Willard, was employed on\r\nthe _Winesburg Eagle_ and for a long time he went to see Alice almost\r\nevery evening. Together the two walked under the trees through the\r\nstreets of the town and talked of what they would do with their lives.\r\nAlice was then a very pretty girl and Ned Currie took her into his arms\r\nand kissed her. He became excited and said things he did not intend to\r\nsay and Alice, betrayed by her desire to have something beautiful come\r\ninto her rather narrow life, also grew excited. She also talked. The\r\nouter crust of her life, all of her natural diffidence and reserve, was\r\ntorn away and she gave herself over to the emotions of love. When, late\r\nin the fall of her sixteenth year, Ned Currie went away to Cleveland\r\nwhere he hoped to get a place on a city newspaper and rise in the\r\nworld, she wanted to go with him. With a trembling voice she told him\r\nwhat was in her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cI will work and you can work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nnot want to harness you to a needless expense that will prevent your\r\nmaking progress. Don\xe2\x80\x99t marry me now. We will get along without that and\r\nwe can be together. Even though we live in the same house no one will\r\nsay anything. In the city we will be unknown and people will pay no\r\nattention to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNed Currie was puzzled by the determination and abandon of his\r\nsweetheart and was also deeply touched. He had wanted the girl to\r\nbecome his mistress but changed his mind. He wanted to protect and care\r\nfor her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou may be sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you do no such thing. As soon as I get a good\r\njob I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back. For the present you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stay here. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nonly thing we can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the evening before he left Winesburg to take up his new life in the\r\ncity, Ned Currie went to call on Alice. They walked about through the\r\nstreets for an hour and then got a rig from Wesley Moyer\xe2\x80\x99s livery and\r\nwent for a drive in the country. The moon came up and they found\r\nthemselves unable to talk. In his sadness the young man forgot the\r\nresolutions he had made regarding his conduct with the girl.\r\n\r\nThey got out of the buggy at a place where a long meadow ran down to\r\nthe bank of Wine Creek and there in the dim light became lovers. When\r\nat midnight they returned to town they were both glad. It did not seem\r\nto them that anything that could happen in the future could blot out\r\nthe wonder and beauty of the thing that had happened. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we will have\r\nto stick to each other, whatever happens we will have to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d Ned\r\nCurrie said as he left the girl at her father\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nThe young newspaper man did not succeed in getting a place on a\r\nCleveland paper and went west to Chicago. For a time he was lonely and\r\nwrote to Alice almost every day. Then he was caught up by the life of\r\nthe city; he began to make friends and found new interests in life. In\r\nChicago he boarded at a house where there were several women. One of\r\nthem attracted his attention and he forgot Alice in Winesburg. At the\r\nend of a year he had stopped writing letters, and only once in a long\r\ntime, when he was lonely or when he went into one of the city parks and\r\nsaw the moon shining on the grass as it had shone that night on the\r\nmeadow by Wine Creek, did he think of her at all.\r\n\r\nIn Winesburg the girl who had been loved grew to be a woman. When she\r\nwas twenty-two years old her father, who owned a harness repair shop,\r\ndied suddenly. The harness maker was an old soldier, and after a few\r\nmonths his wife received a widow\xe2\x80\x99s pension. She used the first money\r\nshe got to buy a loom and became a weaver of carpets, and Alice got a\r\nplace in Winney\xe2\x80\x99s store. For a number of years nothing could have\r\ninduced her to believe that Ned Currie would not in the end return to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe was glad to be employed because the daily round of toil in the\r\nstore made the time of waiting seem less long and uninteresting. She\r\nbegan to save money, thinking that when she had saved two or three\r\nhundred dollars she would follow her lover to the city and try if her\r\npresence would not win back his affections.\r\n\r\nAlice did not blame Ned Currie for what had happened in the moonlight\r\nin the field, but felt that she could never marry another man. To her\r\nthe thought of giving to another what she still felt could belong only\r\nto Ned seemed monstrous. When other young men tried to attract her\r\nattention she would have nothing to do with them. \xe2\x80\x9cI am his wife and\r\nshall remain his wife whether he comes back or not,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to\r\nherself, and for all of her willingness to support herself could not\r\nhave understood the growing modern idea of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s owning herself and\r\ngiving and taking for her own ends in life.\r\n\r\nAlice worked in the dry goods store from eight in the morning until six\r\nat night and on three evenings a week went back to the store to stay\r\nfrom seven until nine. As time passed and she became more and more\r\nlonely she began to practice the devices common to lonely people. When\r\nat night she went upstairs into her own room she knelt on the floor to\r\npray and in her prayers whispered things she wanted to say to her\r\nlover. She became attached to inanimate objects, and because it was her\r\nown, could not bare to have anyone touch the furniture of her room. The\r\ntrick of saving money, begun for a purpose, was carried on after the\r\nscheme of going to the city to find Ned Currie had been given up. It\r\nbecame a fixed habit, and when she needed new clothes she did not get\r\nthem. Sometimes on rainy afternoons in the store she got out her bank\r\nbook and, letting it lie open before her, spent hours dreaming\r\nimpossible dreams of saving money enough so that the interest would\r\nsupport both herself and her future husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNed always liked to travel about,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give him the\r\nchance. Some day when we are married and I can save both his money and\r\nmy own, we will be rich. Then we can travel together all over the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the dry goods store weeks ran into months and months into years as\r\nAlice waited and dreamed of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s return. Her employer, a grey\r\nold man with false teeth and a thin grey mustache that drooped down\r\nover his mouth, was not given to conversation, and sometimes, on rainy\r\ndays and in the winter when a storm raged in Main Street, long hours\r\npassed when no customers came in. Alice arranged and rearranged the\r\nstock. She stood near the front window where she could look down the\r\ndeserted street and thought of the evenings when she had walked with\r\nNed Currie and of what he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will have to stick to each\r\nother now.\xe2\x80\x9d The words echoed and re-echoed through the mind of the\r\nmaturing woman. Tears came into her eyes. Sometimes when her employer\r\nhad gone out and she was alone in the store she put her head on the\r\ncounter and wept. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ned, I am waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered over and over,\r\nand all the time the creeping fear that he would never come back grew\r\nstronger within her.\r\n\r\nIn the spring when the rains have passed and before the long hot days\r\nof summer have come, the country about Winesburg is delightful. The\r\ntown lies in the midst of open fields, but beyond the fields are\r\npleasant patches of woodlands. In the wooded places are many little\r\ncloistered nooks, quiet places where lovers go to sit on Sunday\r\nafternoons. Through the trees they look out across the fields and see\r\nfarmers at work about the barns or people driving up and down on the\r\nroads. In the town bells ring and occasionally a train passes, looking\r\nlike a toy thing in the distance.\r\n\r\nFor several years after Ned Currie went away Alice did not go into the\r\nwood with the other young people on Sunday, but one day after he had\r\nbeen gone for two or three years and when her loneliness seemed\r\nunbearable, she put on her best dress and set out. Finding a little\r\nsheltered place from which she could see the town and a long stretch of\r\nthe fields, she sat down. Fear of age and ineffectuality took\r\npossession of her. She could not sit still, and arose. As she stood\r\nlooking out over the land something, perhaps the thought of never\r\nceasing life as it expresses itself in the flow of the seasons, fixed\r\nher mind on the passing years. With a shiver of dread, she realized\r\nthat for her the beauty and freshness of youth had passed. For the\r\nfirst time she felt that she had been cheated. She did not blame Ned\r\nCurrie and did not know what to blame. Sadness swept over her. Dropping\r\nto her knees, she tried to pray, but instead of prayers words of\r\nprotest came to her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not going to come to me. I will never\r\nfind happiness. Why do I tell myself lies?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and an odd sense\r\nof relief came with this, her first bold attempt to face the fear that\r\nhad become a part of her everyday life.\r\n\r\nIn the year when Alice Hindman became twenty-five two things happened\r\nto disturb the dull uneventfulness of her days. Her mother married Bush\r\nMilton, the carriage painter of Winesburg, and she herself became a\r\nmember of the Winesburg Methodist Church. Alice joined the church\r\nbecause she had become frightened by the loneliness of her position in\r\nlife. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s second marriage had emphasized her isolation. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nbecoming old and queer. If Ned comes he will not want me. In the city\r\nwhere he is living men are perpetually young. There is so much going on\r\nthat they do not have time to grow old,\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself with a grim\r\nlittle smile, and went resolutely about the business of becoming\r\nacquainted with people. Every Thursday evening when the store had\r\nclosed she went to a prayer meeting in the basement of the church and\r\non Sunday evening attended a meeting of an organization called The\r\nEpworth League.\r\n\r\nWhen Will Hurley, a middle-aged man who clerked in a drug store and who\r\nalso belonged to the church, offered to walk home with her she did not\r\nprotest. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I will not let him make a practice of being with\r\nme, but if he comes to see me once in a long time there can be no harm\r\nin that,\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself, still determined in her loyalty to Ned\r\nCurrie.\r\n\r\nWithout realizing what was happening, Alice was trying feebly at first,\r\nbut with growing determination, to get a new hold upon life. Beside the\r\ndrug clerk she walked in silence, but sometimes in the darkness as they\r\nwent stolidly along she put out her hand and touched softly the folds\r\nof his coat. When he left her at the gate before her mother\xe2\x80\x99s house she\r\ndid not go indoors, but stood for a moment by the door. She wanted to\r\ncall to the drug clerk, to ask him to sit with her in the darkness on\r\nthe porch before the house, but was afraid he would not understand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis not him that I want,\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to avoid being so\r\nmuch alone. If I am not careful I will grow unaccustomed to being with\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early fall of her twenty-seventh year a passionate\r\nrestlessness took possession of Alice. She could not bear to be in the\r\ncompany of the drug clerk, and when, in the evening, he came to walk\r\nwith her she sent him away. Her mind became intensely active and when,\r\nweary from the long hours of standing behind the counter in the store,\r\nshe went home and crawled into bed, she could not sleep. With staring\r\neyes she looked into the darkness. Her imagination, like a child\r\nawakened from long sleep, played about the room. Deep within her there\r\nwas something that would not be cheated by phantasies and that demanded\r\nsome definite answer from life.\r\n\r\nAlice took a pillow into her arms and held it tightly against her\r\nbreasts. Getting out of bed, she arranged a blanket so that in the\r\ndarkness it looked like a form lying between the sheets and, kneeling\r\nbeside the bed, she caressed it, whispering words over and over, like a\r\nrefrain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t something happen? Why am I left here alone?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmuttered. Although she sometimes thought of Ned Currie, she no longer\r\ndepended on him. Her desire had grown vague. She did not want Ned\r\nCurrie or any other man. She wanted to be loved, to have something\r\nanswer the call that was growing louder and louder within her.\r\n\r\nAnd then one night when it rained Alice had an adventure. It frightened\r\nand confused her. She had come home from the store at nine and found\r\nthe house empty. Bush Milton had gone off to town and her mother to the\r\nhouse of a neighbor. Alice went upstairs to her room and undressed in\r\nthe darkness. For a moment she stood by the window hearing the rain\r\nbeat against the glass and then a strange desire took possession of\r\nher. Without stopping to think of what she intended to do, she ran\r\ndownstairs through the dark house and out into the rain. As she stood\r\non the little grass plot before the house and felt the cold rain on her\r\nbody a mad desire to run naked through the streets took possession of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe thought that the rain would have some creative and wonderful effect\r\non her body. Not for years had she felt so full of youth and courage.\r\nShe wanted to leap and run, to cry out, to find some other lonely human\r\nand embrace him. On the brick sidewalk before the house a man stumbled\r\nhomeward. Alice started to run. A wild, desperate mood took possession\r\nof her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care who it is. He is alone, and I will go to him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe thought; and then without stopping to consider the possible result\r\nof her madness, called softly. \xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go away.\r\nWhoever you are, you must wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man on the sidewalk stopped and stood listening. He was an old man\r\nand somewhat deaf. Putting his hand to his mouth, he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\r\nWhat say?\xe2\x80\x9d he called.\r\n\r\nAlice dropped to the ground and lay trembling. She was so frightened at\r\nthe thought of what she had done that when the man had gone on his way\r\nshe did not dare get to her feet, but crawled on hands and knees\r\nthrough the grass to the house. When she got to her own room she bolted\r\nthe door and drew her dressing table across the doorway. Her body shook\r\nas with a chill and her hands trembled so that she had difficulty\r\ngetting into her nightdress. When she got into bed she buried her face\r\nin the pillow and wept brokenheartedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with me? I\r\nwill do something dreadful if I am not careful,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, and\r\nturning her face to the wall, began trying to force herself to face\r\nbravely the fact that many people must live and die alone, even in\r\nWinesburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPECTABILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have lived in cities and have walked in the park on a summer\r\nafternoon, you have perhaps seen, blinking in a corner of his iron\r\ncage, a huge, grotesque kind of monkey, a creature with ugly, sagging,\r\nhairless skin below his eyes and a bright purple underbody. This monkey\r\nis a true monster. In the completeness of his ugliness he achieved a\r\nkind of perverted beauty. Children stopping before the cage are\r\nfascinated, men turn away with an air of disgust, and women linger for\r\na moment, trying perhaps to remember which one of their male\r\nacquaintances the thing in some faint way resembles.\r\n\r\nHad you been in the earlier years of your life a citizen of the village\r\nof Winesburg, Ohio, there would have been for you no mystery in regard\r\nto the beast in his cage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is like Wash Williams,\xe2\x80\x9d you would have\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAs he sits in the corner there, the beast is exactly like old\r\nWash sitting on the grass in the station yard on a summer evening after\r\nhe has closed his office for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWash Williams, the telegraph operator of Winesburg, was the ugliest\r\nthing in town. His girth was immense, his neck thin, his legs feeble.\r\nHe was dirty. Everything about him was unclean. Even the whites of his\r\neyes looked soiled.\r\n\r\nI go too fast. Not everything about Wash was unclean. He took care of\r\nhis hands. His fingers were fat, but there was something sensitive and\r\nshapely in the hand that lay on the table by the instrument in the\r\ntelegraph office. In his youth Wash Williams had been called the best\r\ntelegraph operator in the state, and in spite of his degradement to the\r\nobscure office at Winesburg, he was still proud of his ability.\r\n\r\nWash Williams did not associate with the men of the town in which he\r\nlived. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing to do with them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking with\r\nbleary eyes at the men who walked along the station platform past the\r\ntelegraph office. Up along Main Street he went in the evening to Ed\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x99s saloon, and after drinking unbelievable quantities of beer\r\nstaggered off to his room in the New Willard House and to his bed for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nWash Williams was a man of courage. A thing had happened to him that\r\nmade him hate life, and he hated it wholeheartedly, with the abandon of\r\na poet. First of all, he hated women. \xe2\x80\x9cBitches,\xe2\x80\x9d he called them. His\r\nfeeling toward men was somewhat different. He pitied them. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes not\r\nevery man let his life be managed for him by some bitch or another?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nIn Winesburg no attention was paid to Wash Williams and his hatred of\r\nhis fellows. Once Mrs. White, the banker\xe2\x80\x99s wife, complained to the\r\ntelegraph company, saying that the office in Winesburg was dirty and\r\nsmelled abominably, but nothing came of her complaint. Here and there a\r\nman respected the operator. Instinctively the man felt in him a glowing\r\nresentment of something he had not the courage to resent. When Wash\r\nwalked through the streets such a one had an instinct to pay him\r\nhomage, to raise his hat or to bow before him. The superintendent who\r\nhad supervision over the telegraph operators on the railroad that went\r\nthrough Winesburg felt that way. He had put Wash into the obscure\r\noffice at Winesburg to avoid discharging him, and he meant to keep him\r\nthere. When he received the letter of complaint from the banker\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\nhe tore it up and laughed unpleasantly. For some reason he thought of\r\nhis own wife as he tore up the letter.\r\n\r\nWash Williams once had a wife. When he was still a young man he married\r\na woman at Dayton, Ohio. The woman was tall and slender and had blue\r\neyes and yellow hair. Wash was himself a comely youth. He loved the\r\nwoman with a love as absorbing as the hatred he later felt for all\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn all of Winesburg there was but one person who knew the story of the\r\nthing that had made ugly the person and the character of Wash Williams.\r\nHe once told the story to George Willard and the telling of the tale\r\ncame about in this way:\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard went one evening to walk with Belle Carpenter, a trimmer\r\nof women\xe2\x80\x99s hats who worked in a millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate\r\nMcHugh. The young man was not in love with the woman, who, in fact, had\r\na suitor who worked as bartender in Ed Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s saloon, but as they\r\nwalked about under the trees they occasionally embraced. The night and\r\ntheir own thoughts had aroused something in them. As they were\r\nreturning to Main Street they passed the little lawn beside the\r\nrailroad station and saw Wash Williams apparently asleep on the grass\r\nbeneath a tree. On the next evening the operator and George Willard\r\nwalked out together. Down the railroad they went and sat on a pile of\r\ndecaying railroad ties beside the tracks. It was then that the operator\r\ntold the young reporter his story of hate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a dozen times George Willard and the strange, shapeless man who\r\nlived at his father\xe2\x80\x99s hotel had been on the point of talking. The young\r\nman looked at the hideous, leering face staring about the hotel dining\r\nroom and was consumed with curiosity. Something he saw lurking in the\r\nstaring eyes told him that the man who had nothing to say to others had\r\nnevertheless something to say to him. On the pile of railroad ties on\r\nthe summer evening, he waited expectantly. When the operator remained\r\nsilent and seemed to have changed his mind about talking, he tried to\r\nmake conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you ever married, Mr. Williams?\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you were and your wife is dead, is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWash Williams spat forth a succession of vile oaths. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is dead as all women are dead. She is a\r\nliving-dead thing, walking in the sight of men and making the earth\r\nfoul by her presence.\xe2\x80\x9d Staring into the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, the man became\r\npurple with rage. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t have fool notions in your head,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife, she is dead; yes, surely. I tell you, all women are dead, my\r\nmother, your mother, that tall dark woman who works in the millinery\r\nstore and with whom I saw you walking about yesterday\xe2\x80\x94all of them, they\r\nare all dead. I tell you there is something rotten about them. I was\r\nmarried, sure. My wife was dead before she married me, she was a foul\r\nthing come out a woman more foul. She was a thing sent to make life\r\nunbearable to me. I was a fool, do you see, as you are now, and so I\r\nmarried this woman. I would like to see men a little begin to\r\nunderstand women. They are sent to prevent men making the world worth\r\nwhile. It is a trick in Nature. Ugh! They are creeping, crawling,\r\nsquirming things, they with their soft hands and their blue eyes. The\r\nsight of a woman sickens me. Why I don\xe2\x80\x99t kill every woman I see I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf frightened and yet fascinated by the light burning in the eyes of\r\nthe hideous old man, George Willard listened, afire with curiosity.\r\nDarkness came on and he leaned forward trying to see the face of the\r\nman who talked. When, in the gathering darkness, he could no longer see\r\nthe purple, bloated face and the burning eyes, a curious fancy came to\r\nhim. Wash Williams talked in low even tones that made his words seem\r\nthe more terrible. In the darkness the young reporter found himself\r\nimagining that he sat on the railroad ties beside a comely young man\r\nwith black hair and black shining eyes. There was something almost\r\nbeautiful in the voice of Wash Williams, the hideous, telling his story\r\nof hate.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph operator of Winesburg, sitting in the darkness on the\r\nrailroad ties, had become a poet. Hatred had raised him to that\r\nelevation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because I saw you kissing the lips of that Belle\r\nCarpenter that I tell you my story,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened to me may\r\nnext happen to you. I want to put you on your guard. Already you may be\r\nhaving dreams in your head. I want to destroy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWash Williams began telling the story of his married life with the tall\r\nblonde girl with the blue eyes whom he had met when he was a young\r\noperator at Dayton, Ohio. Here and there his story was touched with\r\nmoments of beauty intermingled with strings of vile curses. The\r\noperator had married the daughter of a dentist who was the youngest of\r\nthree sisters. On his marriage day, because of his ability, he was\r\npromoted to a position as dispatcher at an increased salary and sent to\r\nan office at Columbus, Ohio. There he settled down with his young wife\r\nand began buying a house on the installment plan.\r\n\r\nThe young telegraph operator was madly in love. With a kind of\r\nreligious fervor he had managed to go through the pitfalls of his youth\r\nand to remain virginal until after his marriage. He made for George\r\nWillard a picture of his life in the house at Columbus, Ohio, with the\r\nyoung wife. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden back of our house we planted vegetables,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know, peas and corn and such things. We went to Columbus in\r\nearly March and as soon as the days became warm I went to work in the\r\ngarden. With a spade I turned up the black ground while she ran about\r\nlaughing and pretending to be afraid of the worms I uncovered. Late in\r\nApril came the planting. In the little paths among the seed beds she\r\nstood holding a paper bag in her hand. The bag was filled with seeds. A\r\nfew at a time she handed me the seeds that I might thrust them into the\r\nwarm, soft ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was a catch in the voice of the man talking in the\r\ndarkness. \xe2\x80\x9cI loved her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t claim not to be a fool. I\r\nlove her yet. There in the dusk in the spring evening I crawled along\r\nthe black ground to her feet and groveled before her. I kissed her\r\nshoes and the ankles above her shoes. When the hem of her garment\r\ntouched my face I trembled. When after two years of that life I found\r\nshe had managed to acquire three other lovers who came regularly to our\r\nhouse when I was away at work, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to touch them or her. I\r\njust sent her home to her mother and said nothing. There was nothing to\r\nsay. I had four hundred dollars in the bank and I gave her that. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her reasons. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. When she had gone I\r\ncried like a silly boy. Pretty soon I had a chance to sell the house\r\nand I sent that money to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWash Williams and George Willard arose from the pile of railroad ties\r\nand walked along the tracks toward town. The operator finished his tale\r\nquickly, breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer mother sent for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wrote me a letter and asked me\r\nto come to their house at Dayton. When I got there it was evening about\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWash Williams\xe2\x80\x99 voice rose to a half scream. \xe2\x80\x9cI sat in the parlor of\r\nthat house two hours. Her mother took me in there and left me. Their\r\nhouse was stylish. They were what is called respectable people. There\r\nwere plush chairs and a couch in the room. I was trembling all over. I\r\nhated the men I thought had wronged her. I was sick of living alone and\r\nwanted her back. The longer I waited the more raw and tender I became.\r\nI thought that if she came in and just touched me with her hand I would\r\nperhaps faint away. I ached to forgive and forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWash Williams stopped and stood staring at George Willard. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbody shook as from a chill. Again the man\xe2\x80\x99s voice became soft and low.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came into the room naked,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cHer mother did that. While\r\nI sat there she was taking the girl\xe2\x80\x99s clothes off, perhaps coaxing her\r\nto do it. First I heard voices at the door that led into a little\r\nhallway and then it opened softly. The girl was ashamed and stood\r\nperfectly still staring at the floor. The mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t come into the\r\nroom. When she had pushed the girl in through the door she stood in the\r\nhallway waiting, hoping we would\xe2\x80\x94well, you see\xe2\x80\x94waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard and the telegraph operator came into the main street of\r\nWinesburg. The lights from the store windows lay bright and shining on\r\nthe sidewalks. People moved about laughing and talking. The young\r\nreporter felt ill and weak. In imagination, he also became old and\r\nshapeless. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the mother killed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wash Williams,\r\nstaring up and down the street. \xe2\x80\x9cI struck her once with a chair and\r\nthen the neighbors came in and took it away. She screamed so loud you\r\nsee. I won\xe2\x80\x99t ever have a chance to kill her now. She died of a fever a\r\nmonth after that happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THINKER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house in which Seth Richmond of Winesburg lived with his mother had\r\nbeen at one time the show place of the town, but when young Seth lived\r\nthere its glory had become somewhat dimmed. The huge brick house which\r\nBanker White had built on Buckeye Street had overshadowed it. The\r\nRichmond place was in a little valley far out at the end of Main\r\nStreet. Farmers coming into town by a dusty road from the south passed\r\nby a grove of walnut trees, skirted the Fair Ground with its high board\r\nfence covered with advertisements, and trotted their horses down\r\nthrough the valley past the Richmond place into town. As much of the\r\ncountry north and south of Winesburg was devoted to fruit and berry\r\nraising, Seth saw wagon-loads of berry pickers\xe2\x80\x94boys, girls, and\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94going to the fields in the morning and returning covered with\r\ndust in the evening. The chattering crowd, with their rude jokes cried\r\nout from wagon to wagon, sometimes irritated him sharply. He regretted\r\nthat he also could not laugh boisterously, shout meaningless jokes and\r\nmake of himself a figure in the endless stream of moving, giggling\r\nactivity that went up and down the road.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond house was built of limestone, and, although it was said in\r\nthe village to have become run down, had in reality grown more\r\nbeautiful with every passing year. Already time had begun a little to\r\ncolor the stone, lending a golden richness to its surface and in the\r\nevening or on dark days touching the shaded places beneath the eaves\r\nwith wavering patches of browns and blacks.\r\n\r\nThe house had been built by Seth\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, a stone quarryman, and\r\nit, together with the stone quarries on Lake Erie eighteen miles to the\r\nnorth, had been left to his son, Clarence Richmond, Seth\xe2\x80\x99s father.\r\nClarence Richmond, a quiet passionate man extraordinarily admired by\r\nhis neighbors, had been killed in a street fight with the editor of a\r\nnewspaper in Toledo, Ohio. The fight concerned the publication of\r\nClarence Richmond\xe2\x80\x99s name coupled with that of a woman school teacher,\r\nand as the dead man had begun the row by firing upon the editor, the\r\neffort to punish the slayer was unsuccessful. After the quarryman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath it was found that much of the money left to him had been\r\nsquandered in speculation and in insecure investments made through the\r\ninfluence of friends.\r\n\r\nLeft with but a small income, Virginia Richmond had settled down to a\r\nretired life in the village and to the raising of her son. Although she\r\nhad been deeply moved by the death of the husband and father, she did\r\nnot at all believe the stories concerning him that ran about after his\r\ndeath. To her mind, the sensitive, boyish man whom all had\r\ninstinctively loved, was but an unfortunate, a being too fine for\r\neveryday life. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing all sorts of stories, but you are not\r\nto believe what you hear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her son. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a good man,\r\nfull of tenderness for everyone, and should not have tried to be a man\r\nof affairs. No matter how much I were to plan and dream of your future,\r\nI could not imagine anything better for you than that you turn out as\r\ngood a man as your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral years after the death of her husband, Virginia Richmond had\r\nbecome alarmed at the growing demands upon her income and had set\r\nherself to the task of increasing it. She had learned stenography and\r\nthrough the influence of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s friends got the position of\r\ncourt stenographer at the county seat. There she went by train each\r\nmorning during the sessions of the court, and when no court sat, spent\r\nher days working among the rosebushes in her garden. She was a tall,\r\nstraight figure of a woman with a plain face and a great mass of brown\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nIn the relationship between Seth Richmond and his mother, there was a\r\nquality that even at eighteen had begun to color all of his traffic\r\nwith men. An almost unhealthy respect for the youth kept the mother for\r\nthe most part silent in his presence. When she did speak sharply to him\r\nhe had only to look steadily into her eyes to see dawning there the\r\npuzzled look he had already noticed in the eyes of others when he\r\nlooked at them.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that the son thought with remarkable clearness and the\r\nmother did not. She expected from all people certain conventional\r\nreactions to life. A boy was your son, you scolded him and he trembled\r\nand looked at the floor. When you had scolded enough he wept and all\r\nwas forgiven. After the weeping and when he had gone to bed, you crept\r\ninto his room and kissed him.\r\n\r\nVirginia Richmond could not understand why her son did not do these\r\nthings. After the severest reprimand, he did not tremble and look at\r\nthe floor but instead looked steadily at her, causing uneasy doubts to\r\ninvade her mind. As for creeping into his room\xe2\x80\x94after Seth had passed\r\nhis fifteenth year, she would have been half afraid to do anything of\r\nthe kind.\r\n\r\nOnce when he was a boy of sixteen, Seth in company with two other boys\r\nran away from home. The three boys climbed into the open door of an\r\nempty freight car and rode some forty miles to a town where a fair was\r\nbeing held. One of the boys had a bottle filled with a combination of\r\nwhiskey and blackberry wine, and the three sat with legs dangling out\r\nof the car door drinking from the bottle. Seth\xe2\x80\x99s two companions sang\r\nand waved their hands to idlers about the stations of the towns through\r\nwhich the train passed. They planned raids upon the baskets of farmers\r\nwho had come with their families to the fair. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will live like kings\r\nand won\xe2\x80\x99t have to spend a penny to see the fair and horse races,\xe2\x80\x9d they\r\ndeclared boastfully.\r\n\r\nAfter the disappearance of Seth, Virginia Richmond walked up and down\r\nthe floor of her home filled with vague alarms. Although on the next\r\nday she discovered, through an inquiry made by the town marshal, on\r\nwhat adventure the boys had gone, she could not quiet herself. All\r\nthrough the night she lay awake hearing the clock tick and telling\r\nherself that Seth, like his father, would come to a sudden and violent\r\nend. So determined was she that the boy should this time feel the\r\nweight of her wrath that, although she would not allow the marshal to\r\ninterfere with his adventure, she got out a pencil and paper and wrote\r\ndown a series of sharp, stinging reproofs she intended to pour out upon\r\nhim. The reproofs she committed to memory, going about the garden and\r\nsaying them aloud like an actor memorizing his part.\r\n\r\nAnd when, at the end of the week, Seth returned, a little weary and\r\nwith coal soot in his ears and about his eyes, she again found herself\r\nunable to reprove him. Walking into the house he hung his cap on a nail\r\nby the kitchen door and stood looking steadily at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to\r\nturn back within an hour after we had started,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what to do. I knew you would be bothered, but I knew also that if\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t go on I would be ashamed of myself. I went through with the\r\nthing for my own good. It was uncomfortable, sleeping on wet straw, and\r\ntwo drunken Negroes came and slept with us. When I stole a lunch basket\r\nout of a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wagon I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking of his children going\r\nall day without food. I was sick of the whole affair, but I was\r\ndetermined to stick it out until the other boys were ready to come\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you did stick it out,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the mother, half resentfully,\r\nand kissing him upon the forehead pretended to busy herself with the\r\nwork about the house.\r\n\r\nOn a summer evening Seth Richmond went to the New Willard House to\r\nvisit his friend, George Willard. It had rained during the afternoon,\r\nbut as he walked through Main Street, the sky had partially cleared and\r\na golden glow lit up the west. Going around a corner, he turned in at\r\nthe door of the hotel and began to climb the stairway leading up to his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s room. In the hotel office the proprietor and two traveling men\r\nwere engaged in a discussion of politics.\r\n\r\nOn the stairway Seth stopped and listened to the voices of the men\r\nbelow. They were excited and talked rapidly. Tom Willard was berating\r\nthe traveling men. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Democrat but your talk makes me sick,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand McKinley. McKinley and Mark Hanna are\r\nfriends. It is impossible perhaps for your mind to grasp that. If\r\nanyone tells you that a friendship can be deeper and bigger and more\r\nworth while than dollars and cents, or even more worth while than state\r\npolitics, you snicker and laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord was interrupted by one of the guests, a tall,\r\ngrey-mustached man who worked for a wholesale grocery house. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nthink that I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Cleveland all these years without knowing Mark\r\nHanna?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cYour talk is piffle. Hanna is after money and\r\nnothing else. This McKinley is his tool. He has McKinley bluffed and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man on the stairs did not linger to hear the rest of the\r\ndiscussion, but went on up the stairway and into the little dark hall.\r\nSomething in the voices of the men talking in the hotel office started\r\na chain of thoughts in his mind. He was lonely and had begun to think\r\nthat loneliness was a part of his character, something that would\r\nalways stay with him. Stepping into a side hall he stood by a window\r\nthat looked into an alleyway. At the back of his shop stood Abner\r\nGroff, the town baker. His tiny bloodshot eyes looked up and down the\r\nalleyway. In his shop someone called the baker, who pretended not to\r\nhear. The baker had an empty milk bottle in his hand and an angry\r\nsullen look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn Winesburg, Seth Richmond was called the \xe2\x80\x9cdeep one.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s like his\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d men said as he went through the streets. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll break out some\r\nof these days. You wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe talk of the town and the respect with which men and boys\r\ninstinctively greeted him, as all men greet silent people, had affected\r\nSeth Richmond\xe2\x80\x99s outlook on life and on himself. He, like most boys, was\r\ndeeper than boys are given credit for being, but he was not what the\r\nmen of the town, and even his mother, thought him to be. No great\r\nunderlying purpose lay back of his habitual silence, and he had no\r\ndefinite plan for his life. When the boys with whom he associated were\r\nnoisy and quarrelsome, he stood quietly at one side. With calm eyes he\r\nwatched the gesticulating lively figures of his companions. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nparticularly interested in what was going on, and sometimes wondered if\r\nhe would ever be particularly interested in anything. Now, as he stood\r\nin the half-darkness by the window watching the baker, he wished that\r\nhe himself might become thoroughly stirred by something, even by the\r\nfits of sullen anger for which Baker Groff was noted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be\r\nbetter for me if I could become excited and wrangle about politics like\r\nwindy old Tom Willard,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he left the window and went\r\nagain along the hallway to the room occupied by his friend, George\r\nWillard.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard was older than Seth Richmond, but in the rather odd\r\nfriendship between the two, it was he who was forever courting and the\r\nyounger boy who was being courted. The paper on which George worked had\r\none policy. It strove to mention by name in each issue, as many as\r\npossible of the inhabitants of the village. Like an excited dog, George\r\nWillard ran here and there, noting on his pad of paper who had gone on\r\nbusiness to the county seat or had returned from a visit to a\r\nneighboring village. All day he wrote little facts upon the pad. \xe2\x80\x9cA. P.\r\nWringlet had received a shipment of straw hats. Ed Byerbaum and Tom\r\nMarshall were in Cleveland Friday. Uncle Tom Sinnings is building a new\r\nbarn on his place on the Valley Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea that George Willard would some day become a writer had given\r\nhim a place of distinction in Winesburg, and to Seth Richmond he talked\r\ncontinually of the matter, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest of all lives to live,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared, becoming excited and boastful. \xe2\x80\x9cHere and there you go and\r\nthere is no one to boss you. Though you are in India or in the South\r\nSeas in a boat, you have but to write and there you are. Wait till I\r\nget my name up and then see what fun I shall have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s room, which had a window looking down into an\r\nalleyway and one that looked across railroad tracks to Biff Carter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLunch Room facing the railroad station, Seth Richmond sat in a chair\r\nand looked at the floor. George Willard, who had been sitting for an\r\nhour idly playing with a lead pencil, greeted him effusively. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen trying to write a love story,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, laughing nervously.\r\nLighting a pipe he began walking up and down the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to fall in love. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting here and\r\nthinking it over and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs though embarrassed by his declaration, George went to a window and\r\nturning his back to his friend leaned out. \xe2\x80\x9cI know who I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nfall in love with,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Helen White. She is the only\r\ngirl in town with any \xe2\x80\x98get-up\xe2\x80\x99 to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStruck with a new idea, young Willard turned and walked toward his\r\nvisitor. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know Helen White better than I do.\r\nI want you to tell her what I said. You just get to talking to her and\r\nsay that I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with her. See what she says to that. See how she\r\ntakes it, and then you come and tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth Richmond arose and went toward the door. The words of his comrade\r\nirritated him unbearably. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said briefly.\r\n\r\nGeorge was amazed. Running forward he stood in the darkness trying to\r\nlook into Seth\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? What are you going to do?\r\nYou stay here and let\xe2\x80\x99s talk,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged.\r\n\r\nA wave of resentment directed against his friend, the men of the town\r\nwho were, he thought, perpetually talking of nothing, and most of all,\r\nagainst his own habit of silence, made Seth half desperate. \xe2\x80\x9cAw, speak\r\nto her yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst forth and then, going quickly through the\r\ndoor, slammed it sharply in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to find Helen\r\nWhite and talk to her, but not about him,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nSeth went down the stairway and out at the front door of the hotel\r\nmuttering with wrath. Crossing a little dusty street and climbing a low\r\niron railing, he went to sit upon the grass in the station yard. George\r\nWillard he thought a profound fool, and he wished that he had said so\r\nmore vigorously. Although his acquaintanceship with Helen White, the\r\nbanker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, was outwardly but casual, she was often the subject\r\nof his thoughts and he felt that she was something private and personal\r\nto himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe busy fool with his love stories,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, staring\r\nback over his shoulder at George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s room, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy does he never\r\ntire of his eternal talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was berry harvest time in Winesburg and upon the station platform\r\nmen and boys loaded the boxes of red, fragrant berries into two express\r\ncars that stood upon the siding. A June moon was in the sky, although\r\nin the west a storm threatened, and no street lamps were lighted. In\r\nthe dim light the figures of the men standing upon the express truck\r\nand pitching the boxes in at the doors of the cars were but dimly\r\ndiscernible. Upon the iron railing that protected the station lawn sat\r\nother men. Pipes were lighted. Village jokes went back and forth. Away\r\nin the distance a train whistled and the men loading the boxes into the\r\ncars worked with renewed activity.\r\n\r\nSeth arose from his place on the grass and went silently past the men\r\nperched upon the railing and into Main Street. He had come to a\r\nresolution. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of here,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good am I\r\nhere? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to some city and go to work. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell mother about it\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth Richmond went slowly along Main Street, past Wacker\xe2\x80\x99s Cigar Store\r\nand the Town Hall, and into Buckeye Street. He was depressed by the\r\nthought that he was not a part of the life in his own town, but the\r\ndepression did not cut deeply as he did not think of himself as at\r\nfault. In the heavy shadows of a big tree before Doctor Welling\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, he stopped and stood watching half-witted Turk Smollet, who was\r\npushing a wheelbarrow in the road. The old man with his absurdly boyish\r\nmind had a dozen long boards on the wheelbarrow, and, as he hurried\r\nalong the road, balanced the load with extreme nicety. \xe2\x80\x9cEasy there,\r\nTurk! Steady now, old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man shouted to himself, and laughed\r\nso that the load of boards rocked dangerously.\r\n\r\nSeth knew Turk Smollet, the half dangerous old wood chopper whose\r\npeculiarities added so much of color to the life of the village. He\r\nknew that when Turk got into Main Street he would become the center of\r\na whirlwind of cries and comments, that in truth the old man was going\r\nfar out of his way in order to pass through Main Street and exhibit his\r\nskill in wheeling the boards. \xe2\x80\x9cIf George Willard were here, he\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nsomething to say,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge belongs to this town. He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nshout at Turk and Turk would shout at him. They\xe2\x80\x99d both be secretly\r\npleased by what they had said. It\xe2\x80\x99s different with me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t belong.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not make a fuss about it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out of here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth stumbled forward through the half-darkness, feeling himself an\r\noutcast in his own town. He began to pity himself, but a sense of the\r\nabsurdity of his thoughts made him smile. In the end he decided that he\r\nwas simply old beyond his years and not at all a subject for self-pity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m made to go to work. I may be able to make a place for myself by\r\nsteady working, and I might as well be at it,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided.\r\n\r\nSeth went to the house of Banker White and stood in the darkness by the\r\nfront door. On the door hung a heavy brass knocker, an innovation\r\nintroduced into the village by Helen White\xe2\x80\x99s mother, who had also\r\norganized a women\xe2\x80\x99s club for the study of poetry. Seth raised the\r\nknocker and let it fall. Its heavy clatter sounded like a report from\r\ndistant guns. \xe2\x80\x9cHow awkward and foolish I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mrs.\r\nWhite comes to the door, I won\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Helen White who came to the door and found Seth standing at the\r\nedge of the porch. Blushing with pleasure, she stepped forward, closing\r\nthe door softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out of town. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out of here and go to work. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to\r\nColumbus,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll get into the State University down\r\nthere. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m going. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell mother tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated and\r\nlooked doubtfully about. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind coming to walk with\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth and Helen walked through the streets beneath the trees. Heavy\r\nclouds had drifted across the face of the moon, and before them in the\r\ndeep twilight went a man with a short ladder upon his shoulder.\r\nHurrying forward, the man stopped at the street crossing and, putting\r\nthe ladder against the wooden lamp-post, lighted the village lights so\r\nthat their way was half lighted, half darkened, by the lamps and by the\r\ndeepening shadows cast by the low-branched trees. In the tops of the\r\ntrees the wind began to play, disturbing the sleeping birds so that\r\nthey flew about calling plaintively. In the lighted space before one of\r\nthe lamps, two bats wheeled and circled, pursuing the gathering swarm\r\nof night flies.\r\n\r\nSince Seth had been a boy in knee trousers there had been a half\r\nexpressed intimacy between him and the maiden who now for the first\r\ntime walked beside him. For a time she had been beset with a madness\r\nfor writing notes which she addressed to Seth. He had found them\r\nconcealed in his books at school and one had been given him by a child\r\nmet in the street, while several had been delivered through the village\r\npost office.\r\n\r\nThe notes had been written in a round, boyish hand and had reflected a\r\nmind inflamed by novel reading. Seth had not answered them, although he\r\nhad been moved and flattered by some of the sentences scrawled in\r\npencil upon the stationery of the banker\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Putting them into the\r\npocket of his coat, he went through the street or stood by the fence in\r\nthe school yard with something burning at his side. He thought it fine\r\nthat he should be thus selected as the favorite of the richest and most\r\nattractive girl in town.\r\n\r\nHelen and Seth stopped by a fence near where a low dark building faced\r\nthe street. The building had once been a factory for the making of\r\nbarrel staves but was now vacant. Across the street upon the porch of a\r\nhouse a man and woman talked of their childhood, their voices coming\r\ndearly across to the half-embarrassed youth and maiden. There was the\r\nsound of scraping chairs and the man and woman came down the gravel\r\npath to a wooden gate. Standing outside the gate, the man leaned over\r\nand kissed the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cFor old times\xe2\x80\x99 sake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and, turning,\r\nwalked rapidly away along the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Belle Turner,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Helen, and put her hand boldly into\r\nSeth\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she had a fellow. I thought she was too old\r\nfor that.\xe2\x80\x9d Seth laughed uneasily. The hand of the girl was warm and a\r\nstrange, dizzy feeling crept over him. Into his mind came a desire to\r\ntell her something he had been determined not to tell. \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge\r\nWillard\xe2\x80\x99s in love with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and in spite of his agitation his\r\nvoice was low and quiet. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s writing a story, and he wants to be in\r\nlove. He wants to know how it feels. He wanted me to tell you and see\r\nwhat you said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Helen and Seth walked in silence. They came to the garden\r\nsurrounding the old Richmond place and going through a gap in the hedge\r\nsat on a wooden bench beneath a bush.\r\n\r\nOn the street as he walked beside the girl new and daring thoughts had\r\ncome into Seth Richmond\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He began to regret his decision to get\r\nout of town. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be something new and altogether delightful to\r\nremain and walk often through the streets with Helen White,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought. In imagination he saw himself putting his arm about her waist\r\nand feeling her arms clasped tightly about his neck. One of those odd\r\ncombinations of events and places made him connect the idea of\r\nlove-making with this girl and a spot he had visited some days before.\r\nHe had gone on an errand to the house of a farmer who lived on a\r\nhillside beyond the Fair Ground and had returned by a path through a\r\nfield. At the foot of the hill below the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s house Seth had\r\nstopped beneath a sycamore tree and looked about him. A soft humming\r\nnoise had greeted his ears. For a moment he had thought the tree must\r\nbe the home of a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\nAnd then, looking down, Seth had seen the bees everywhere all about him\r\nin the long grass. He stood in a mass of weeds that grew waist-high in\r\nthe field that ran away from the hillside. The weeds were abloom with\r\ntiny purple blossoms and gave forth an overpowering fragrance. Upon the\r\nweeds the bees were gathered in armies, singing as they worked.\r\n\r\nSeth imagined himself lying on a summer evening, buried deep among the\r\nweeds beneath the tree. Beside him, in the scene built in his fancy,\r\nlay Helen White, her hand lying in his hand. A peculiar reluctance kept\r\nhim from kissing her lips, but he felt he might have done that if he\r\nwished. Instead, he lay perfectly still, looking at her and listening\r\nto the army of bees that sang the sustained masterful song of labor\r\nabove his head.\r\n\r\nOn the bench in the garden Seth stirred uneasily. Releasing the hand of\r\nthe girl, he thrust his hands into his trouser pockets. A desire to\r\nimpress the mind of his companion with the importance of the resolution\r\nhe had made came over him and he nodded his head toward the house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99ll make a fuss, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought\r\nat all about what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do in life. She thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stay\r\non here forever just being a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth\xe2\x80\x99s voice became charged with boyish earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto strike out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get to work. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m good for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen White was impressed. She nodded her head and a feeling of\r\nadmiration swept over her. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is as it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis boy is not a boy at all, but a strong, purposeful man.\xe2\x80\x9d Certain\r\nvague desires that had been invading her body were swept away and she\r\nsat up very straight on the bench. The thunder continued to rumble and\r\nflashes of heat lightning lit up the eastern sky. The garden that had\r\nbeen so mysterious and vast, a place that with Seth beside her might\r\nhave become the background for strange and wonderful adventures, now\r\nseemed no more than an ordinary Winesburg back yard, quite definite and\r\nlimited in its outlines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do up there?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nSeth turned half around on the bench, striving to see her face in the\r\ndarkness. He thought her infinitely more sensible and straightforward\r\nthan George Willard, and was glad he had come away from his friend. A\r\nfeeling of impatience with the town that had been in his mind returned,\r\nand he tried to tell her of it. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone talks and talks,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do something, get into some kind of work where\r\ntalk don\xe2\x80\x99t count. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll just be a mechanic in a shop. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t care much. I just want to work and keep quiet.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth arose from the bench and put out his hand. He did not want to\r\nbring the meeting to an end but could not think of anything more to\r\nsay. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the last time we\xe2\x80\x99ll see each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\nA wave of sentiment swept over Helen. Putting her hand upon Seth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, she started to draw his face down toward her own upturned\r\nface. The act was one of pure affection and cutting regret that some\r\nvague adventure that had been present in the spirit of the night would\r\nnow never be realized. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d better be going along,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nletting her hand fall heavily to her side. A thought came to her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you go with me; I want to be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go and talk\r\nwith your mother. You\xe2\x80\x99d better do that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth hesitated and, as he stood waiting, the girl turned and ran away\r\nthrough the hedge. A desire to run after her came to him, but he only\r\nstood staring, perplexed and puzzled by her action as he had been\r\nperplexed and puzzled by all of the life of the town out of which she\r\nhad come. Walking slowly toward the house, he stopped in the shadow of\r\na large tree and looked at his mother sitting by a lighted window\r\nbusily sewing. The feeling of loneliness that had visited him earlier\r\nin the evening returned and colored his thoughts of the adventure\r\nthrough which he had just passed. \xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, turning and\r\nstaring in the direction taken by Helen White. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how things\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nturn out. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be like the rest. I suppose she\xe2\x80\x99ll begin now to look\r\nat me in a funny way.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the ground and pondered this\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be embarrassed and feel strange when I\xe2\x80\x99m around,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99ll be. That\xe2\x80\x99s how everything\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nturn out. When it comes to loving someone, it won\xe2\x80\x99t never be me. It\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe someone else\xe2\x80\x94some fool\xe2\x80\x94someone who talks a lot\xe2\x80\x94someone like that\r\nGeorge Willard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTANDY\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil she was seven years old she lived in an old unpainted house on an\r\nunused road that led off Trunion Pike. Her father gave her but little\r\nattention and her mother was dead. The father spent his time talking\r\nand thinking of religion. He proclaimed himself an agnostic and was so\r\nabsorbed in destroying the ideas of God that had crept into the minds\r\nof his neighbors that he never saw God manifesting himself in the\r\nlittle child that, half forgotten, lived here and there on the bounty\r\nof her dead mother\xe2\x80\x99s relatives.\r\n\r\nA stranger came to Winesburg and saw in the child what the father did\r\nnot see. He was a tall, redhaired young man who was almost always\r\ndrunk. Sometimes he sat in a chair before the New Willard House with\r\nTom Hard, the father. As Tom talked, declaring there could be no God,\r\nthe stranger smiled and winked at the bystanders. He and Tom became\r\nfriends and were much together.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was the son of a rich merchant of Cleveland and had come\r\nto Winesburg on a mission. He wanted to cure himself of the habit of\r\ndrink, and thought that by escaping from his city associates and living\r\nin a rural community he would have a better chance in the struggle with\r\nthe appetite that was destroying him.\r\n\r\nHis sojourn in Winesburg was not a success. The dullness of the passing\r\nhours led to his drinking harder than ever. But he did succeed in doing\r\nsomething. He gave a name rich with meaning to Tom Hard\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\nOne evening when he was recovering from a long debauch the stranger\r\ncame reeling along the main street of the town. Tom Hard sat in a chair\r\nbefore the New Willard House with his daughter, then a child of five,\r\non his knees. Beside him on the board sidewalk sat young George\r\nWillard. The stranger dropped into a chair beside them. His body shook\r\nand when he tried to talk his voice trembled.\r\n\r\nIt was late evening and darkness lay over the town and over the\r\nrailroad that ran along the foot of a little incline before the hotel.\r\nSomewhere in the distance, off to the west, there was a prolonged blast\r\nfrom the whistle of a passenger engine. A dog that had been sleeping in\r\nthe roadway arose and barked. The stranger began to babble and made a\r\nprophecy concerning the child that lay in the arms of the agnostic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came here to quit drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and tears began to run down\r\nhis cheeks. He did not look at Tom Hard, but leaned forward and stared\r\ninto the darkness as though seeing a vision. \xe2\x80\x9cI ran away to the country\r\nto be cured, but I am not cured. There is a reason.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to look\r\nat the child who sat up very straight on her father\xe2\x80\x99s knee and returned\r\nthe look.\r\n\r\nThe stranger touched Tom Hard on the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cDrink is not the only thing\r\nto which I am addicted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something else. I am a\r\nlover and have not found my thing to love. That is a big point if you\r\nknow enough to realize what I mean. It makes my destruction inevitable,\r\nyou see. There are few who understand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger became silent and seemed overcome with sadness, but\r\nanother blast from the whistle of the passenger engine aroused him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave not lost faith. I proclaim that. I have only been brought to the\r\nplace where I know my faith will not be realized,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared\r\nhoarsely. He looked hard at the child and began to address her, paying\r\nno more attention to the father. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a woman coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nand his voice was now sharp and earnest. \xe2\x80\x9cI have missed her, you see.\r\nShe did not come in my time. You may be the woman. It would be like\r\nfate to let me stand in her presence once, on such an evening as this,\r\nwhen I have destroyed myself with drink and she is as yet only a\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shoulders of the stranger shook violently, and when he tried to\r\nroll a cigarette the paper fell from his trembling fingers. He grew\r\nangry and scolded. \xe2\x80\x9cThey think it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to be a woman, to be loved,\r\nbut I know better,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. Again he turned to the child. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps of all men I alone understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis glance again wandered away to the darkened street. \xe2\x80\x9cI know about\r\nher, although she has never crossed my path,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nabout her struggles and her defeats. It is because of her defeats that\r\nshe is to me the lovely one. Out of her defeats has been born a new\r\nquality in woman. I have a name for it. I call it Tandy. I made up the\r\nname when I was a true dreamer and before my body became vile. It is\r\nthe quality of being strong to be loved. It is something men need from\r\nwomen and that they do not get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger arose and stood before Tom Hard. His body rocked back and\r\nforth and he seemed about to fall, but instead he dropped to his knees\r\non the sidewalk and raised the hands of the little girl to his drunken\r\nlips. He kissed them ecstatically. \xe2\x80\x9cBe Tandy, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare to be strong and courageous. That is the road. Venture anything.\r\nBe brave enough to dare to be loved. Be something more than man or\r\nwoman. Be Tandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger arose and staggered off down the street. A day or two\r\nlater he got aboard a train and returned to his home in Cleveland. On\r\nthe summer evening, after the talk before the hotel, Tom Hard took the\r\ngirl child to the house of a relative where she had been invited to\r\nspend the night. As he went along in the darkness under the trees he\r\nforgot the babbling voice of the stranger and his mind returned to the\r\nmaking of arguments by which he might destroy men\xe2\x80\x99s faith in God. He\r\nspoke his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s name and she began to weep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be called that,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be called\r\nTandy\xe2\x80\x94Tandy Hard.\xe2\x80\x9d The child wept so bitterly that Tom Hard was touched\r\nand tried to comfort her. He stopped beneath a tree and, taking her\r\ninto his arms, began to caress her. \xe2\x80\x9cBe good, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply;\r\nbut she would not be quieted. With childish abandon she gave herself\r\nover to grief, her voice breaking the evening stillness of the street.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be Tandy. I want to be Tandy. I want to be Tandy Hard,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried, shaking her head and sobbing as though her young strength were\r\nnot enough to bear the vision the words of the drunkard had brought to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRENGTH OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Curtis Hartman was pastor of the Presbyterian Church of\r\nWinesburg, and had been in that position ten years. He was forty years\r\nold, and by his nature very silent and reticent. To preach, standing in\r\nthe pulpit before the people, was always a hardship for him and from\r\nWednesday morning until Saturday evening he thought of nothing but the\r\ntwo sermons that must be preached on Sunday. Early on Sunday morning he\r\nwent into a little room called a study in the bell tower of the church\r\nand prayed. In his prayers there was one note that always predominated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me strength and courage for Thy work, O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded,\r\nkneeling on the bare floor and bowing his head in the presence of the\r\ntask that lay before him.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Hartman was a tall man with a brown beard. His wife, a\r\nstout, nervous woman, was the daughter of a manufacturer of underwear\r\nat Cleveland, Ohio. The minister himself was rather a favorite in the\r\ntown. The elders of the church liked him because he was quiet and\r\nunpretentious and Mrs. White, the banker\xe2\x80\x99s wife, thought him scholarly\r\nand refined.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian Church held itself somewhat aloof from the other\r\nchurches of Winesburg. It was larger and more imposing and its minister\r\nwas better paid. He even had a carriage of his own and on summer\r\nevenings sometimes drove about town with his wife. Through Main Street\r\nand up and down Buckeye Street he went, bowing gravely to the people,\r\nwhile his wife, afire with secret pride, looked at him out of the\r\ncorners of her eyes and worried lest the horse become frightened and\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\nFor a good many years after he came to Winesburg things went well with\r\nCurtis Hartman. He was not one to arouse keen enthusiasm among the\r\nworshippers in his church but on the other hand he made no enemies. In\r\nreality he was much in earnest and sometimes suffered prolonged periods\r\nof remorse because he could not go crying the word of God in the\r\nhighways and byways of the town. He wondered if the flame of the spirit\r\nreally burned in him and dreamed of a day when a strong sweet new\r\ncurrent of power would come like a great wind into his voice and his\r\nsoul and the people would tremble before the spirit of God made\r\nmanifest in him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a poor stick and that will never really happen\r\nto me,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused dejectedly, and then a patient smile lit up his\r\nfeatures. \xe2\x80\x9cOh well, I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m doing well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nphilosophically.\r\n\r\nThe room in the bell tower of the church, where on Sunday mornings the\r\nminister prayed for an increase in him of the power of God, had but one\r\nwindow. It was long and narrow and swung outward on a hinge like a\r\ndoor. On the window, made of little leaded panes, was a design showing\r\nthe Christ laying his hand upon the head of a child. One Sunday morning\r\nin the summer as he sat by his desk in the room with a large Bible\r\nopened before him, and the sheets of his sermon scattered about, the\r\nminister was shocked to see, in the upper room of the house next door,\r\na woman lying in her bed and smoking a cigarette while she read a book.\r\nCurtis Hartman went on tiptoe to the window and closed it softly. He\r\nwas horror stricken at the thought of a woman smoking and trembled also\r\nto think that his eyes, just raised from the pages of the book of God,\r\nhad looked upon the bare shoulders and white throat of a woman. With\r\nhis brain in a whirl he went down into the pulpit and preached a long\r\nsermon without once thinking of his gestures or his voice. The sermon\r\nattracted unusual attention because of its power and clearness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder if she is listening, if my voice is carrying a message into her\r\nsoul,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought and began to hope that on future Sunday mornings he\r\nmight be able to say words that would touch and awaken the woman\r\napparently far gone in secret sin.\r\n\r\nThe house next door to the Presbyterian Church, through the windows of\r\nwhich the minister had seen the sight that had so upset him, was\r\noccupied by two women. Aunt Elizabeth Swift, a grey competent-looking\r\nwidow with money in the Winesburg National Bank, lived there with her\r\ndaughter Kate Swift, a school teacher. The school teacher was thirty\r\nyears old and had a neat trim-looking figure. She had few friends and\r\nbore a reputation of having a sharp tongue. When he began to think\r\nabout her, Curtis Hartman remembered that she had been to Europe and\r\nhad lived for two years in New York City. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps after all her\r\nsmoking means nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He began to remember that when he\r\nwas a student in college and occasionally read novels, good, although\r\nsomewhat worldly women, had smoked through the pages of a book that had\r\nonce fallen into his hands. With a rush of new determination he worked\r\non his sermons all through the week and forgot, in his zeal to reach\r\nthe ears and the soul of this new listener, both his embarrassment in\r\nthe pulpit and the necessity of prayer in the study on Sunday mornings.\r\n\r\nReverend Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s experience with women had been somewhat limited. He\r\nwas the son of a wagon maker from Muncie, Indiana, and had worked his\r\nway through college. The daughter of the underwear manufacturer had\r\nboarded in a house where he lived during his school days and he had\r\nmarried her after a formal and prolonged courtship, carried on for the\r\nmost part by the girl herself. On his marriage day the underwear\r\nmanufacturer had given his daughter five thousand dollars and he\r\npromised to leave her at least twice that amount in his will. The\r\nminister had thought himself fortunate in marriage and had never\r\npermitted himself to think of other women. He did not want to think of\r\nother women. What he wanted was to do the work of God quietly and\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\nIn the soul of the minister a struggle awoke. From wanting to reach the\r\nears of Kate Swift, and through his sermons to delve into her soul, he\r\nbegan to want also to look again at the figure lying white and quiet in\r\nthe bed. On a Sunday morning when he could not sleep because of his\r\nthoughts he arose and went to walk in the streets. When he had gone\r\nalong Main Street almost to the old Richmond place he stopped and\r\npicking up a stone rushed off to the room in the bell tower. With the\r\nstone he broke out a corner of the window and then locked the door and\r\nsat down at the desk before the open Bible to wait. When the shade of\r\nthe window to Kate Swift\xe2\x80\x99s room was raised he could see, through the\r\nhole, directly into her bed, but she was not there. She also had arisen\r\nand had gone for a walk and the hand that raised the shade was the hand\r\nof Aunt Elizabeth Swift.\r\n\r\nThe minister almost wept with joy at this deliverance from the carnal\r\ndesire to \xe2\x80\x9cpeep\xe2\x80\x9d and went back to his own house praising God. In an ill\r\nmoment he forgot, however, to stop the hole in the window. The piece of\r\nglass broken out at the corner of the window just nipped off the bare\r\nheel of the boy standing motionless and looking with rapt eyes into the\r\nface of the Christ.\r\n\r\nCurtis Hartman forgot his sermon on that Sunday morning. He talked to\r\nhis congregation and in his talk said that it was a mistake for people\r\nto think of their minister as a man set aside and intended by nature to\r\nlead a blameless life. \xe2\x80\x9cOut of my own experience I know that we, who\r\nare the ministers of God\xe2\x80\x99s word, are beset by the same temptations that\r\nassail you,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been tempted and have surrendered to\r\ntemptation. It is only the hand of God, placed beneath my head, that\r\nhas raised me up. As he has raised me so also will he raise you. Do not\r\ndespair. In your hour of sin raise your eyes to the skies and you will\r\nbe again and again saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nResolutely the minister put the thoughts of the woman in the bed out of\r\nhis mind and began to be something like a lover in the presence of his\r\nwife. One evening when they drove out together he turned the horse out\r\nof Buckeye Street and in the darkness on Gospel Hill, above Waterworks\r\nPond, put his arm about Sarah Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s waist. When he had eaten\r\nbreakfast in the morning and was ready to retire to his study at the\r\nback of his house he went around the table and kissed his wife on the\r\ncheek. When thoughts of Kate Swift came into his head, he smiled and\r\nraised his eyes to the skies. \xe2\x80\x9cIntercede for me, Master,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeep me in the narrow path intent on Thy work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now began the real struggle in the soul of the brown-bearded\r\nminister. By chance he discovered that Kate Swift was in the habit of\r\nlying in her bed in the evenings and reading a book. A lamp stood on a\r\ntable by the side of the bed and the light streamed down upon her white\r\nshoulders and bare throat. On the evening when he made the discovery\r\nthe minister sat at the desk in the dusty room from nine until after\r\neleven and when her light was put out stumbled out of the church to\r\nspend two more hours walking and praying in the streets. He did not\r\nwant to kiss the shoulders and the throat of Kate Swift and had not\r\nallowed his mind to dwell on such thoughts. He did not know what he\r\nwanted. \xe2\x80\x9cI am God\xe2\x80\x99s child and he must save me from myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\r\nin the darkness under the trees as he wandered in the streets. By a\r\ntree he stood and looked at the sky that was covered with hurrying\r\nclouds. He began to talk to God intimately and closely. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease,\r\nFather, do not forget me. Give me power to go tomorrow and repair the\r\nhole in the window. Lift my eyes again to the skies. Stay with me, Thy\r\nservant, in his hour of need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp and down through the silent streets walked the minister and for days\r\nand weeks his soul was troubled. He could not understand the temptation\r\nthat had come to him nor could he fathom the reason for its coming. In\r\na way he began to blame God, saying to himself that he had tried to\r\nkeep his feet in the true path and had not run about seeking sin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough my days as a young man and all through my life here I have\r\ngone quietly about my work,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy now should I be tempted?\r\nWhat have I done that this burden should be laid on me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree times during the early fall and winter of that year Curtis\r\nHartman crept out of his house to the room in the bell tower to sit in\r\nthe darkness looking at the figure of Kate Swift lying in her bed and\r\nlater went to walk and pray in the streets. He could not understand\r\nhimself. For weeks he would go along scarcely thinking of the school\r\nteacher and telling himself that he had conquered the carnal desire to\r\nlook at her body. And then something would happen. As he sat in the\r\nstudy of his own house, hard at work on a sermon, he would become\r\nnervous and begin to walk up and down the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go out into the\r\nstreets,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself and even as he let himself in at the church\r\ndoor he persistently denied to himself the cause of his being there. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill not repair the hole in the window and I will train myself to come\r\nhere at night and sit in the presence of this woman without raising my\r\neyes. I will not be defeated in this thing. The Lord has devised this\r\ntemptation as a test of my soul and I will grope my way out of darkness\r\ninto the light of righteousness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne night in January when it was bitter cold and snow lay deep on the\r\nstreets of Winesburg Curtis Hartman paid his last visit to the room in\r\nthe bell tower of the church. It was past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he left his\r\nown house and he set out so hurriedly that he forgot to put on his\r\novershoes. In Main Street no one was abroad but Hop Higgins the night\r\nwatchman and in the whole town no one was awake but the watchman and\r\nyoung George Willard, who sat in the office of the _Winesburg Eagle_\r\ntrying to write a story. Along the street to the church went the\r\nminister, plowing through the drifts and thinking that this time he\r\nwould utterly give way to sin. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to look at the woman and to\r\nthink of kissing her shoulders and I am going to let myself think what\r\nI choose,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared bitterly and tears came into his eyes. He began\r\nto think that he would get out of the ministry and try some other way\r\nof life. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go to some city and get into business,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my nature is such that I cannot resist sin, I shall give myself\r\nover to sin. At least I shall not be a hypocrite, preaching the word of\r\nGod with my mind thinking of the shoulders and neck of a woman who does\r\nnot belong to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was cold in the room of the bell tower of the church on that January\r\nnight and almost as soon as he came into the room Curtis Hartman knew\r\nthat if he stayed he would be ill. His feet were wet from tramping in\r\nthe snow and there was no fire. In the room in the house next door Kate\r\nSwift had not yet appeared. With grim determination the man sat down to\r\nwait. Sitting in the chair and gripping the edge of the desk on which\r\nlay the Bible he stared into the darkness thinking the blackest\r\nthoughts of his life. He thought of his wife and for the moment almost\r\nhated her. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has always been ashamed of passion and has cheated me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe thought. \xe2\x80\x9cMan has a right to expect living passion and beauty in a\r\nwoman. He has no right to forget that he is an animal and in me there\r\nis something that is Greek. I will throw off the woman of my bosom and\r\nseek other women. I will besiege this school teacher. I will fly in the\r\nface of all men and if I am a creature of carnal lusts I will live then\r\nfor my lusts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distracted man trembled from head to foot, partly from cold, partly\r\nfrom the struggle in which he was engaged. Hours passed and a fever\r\nassailed his body. His throat began to hurt and his teeth chattered.\r\nHis feet on the study floor felt like two cakes of ice. Still he would\r\nnot give up. \xe2\x80\x9cI will see this woman and will think the thoughts I have\r\nnever dared to think,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself, gripping the edge of the desk\r\nand waiting.\r\n\r\nCurtis Hartman came near dying from the effects of that night of\r\nwaiting in the church, and also he found in the thing that happened\r\nwhat he took to be the way of life for him. On other evenings when he\r\nhad waited he had not been able to see, through the little hole in the\r\nglass, any part of the school teacher\xe2\x80\x99s room except that occupied by\r\nher bed. In the darkness he had waited until the woman suddenly\r\nappeared sitting in the bed in her white nightrobe. When the light was\r\nturned up she propped herself up among the pillows and read a book.\r\nSometimes she smoked one of the cigarettes. Only her bare shoulders and\r\nthroat were visible.\r\n\r\nOn the January night, after he had come near dying with cold and after\r\nhis mind had two or three times actually slipped away into an odd land\r\nof fantasy so that he had by an exercise of will power to force himself\r\nback into consciousness, Kate Swift appeared. In the room next door a\r\nlamp was lighted and the waiting man stared into an empty bed. Then\r\nupon the bed before his eyes a naked woman threw herself. Lying face\r\ndownward she wept and beat with her fists upon the pillow. With a final\r\noutburst of weeping she half arose, and in the presence of the man who\r\nhad waited to look and not to think thoughts the woman of sin began to\r\npray. In the lamplight her figure, slim and strong, looked like the\r\nfigure of the boy in the presence of the Christ on the leaded window.\r\n\r\nCurtis Hartman never remembered how he got out of the church. With a\r\ncry he arose, dragging the heavy desk along the floor. The Bible fell,\r\nmaking a great clatter in the silence. When the light in the house next\r\ndoor went out he stumbled down the stairway and into the street. Along\r\nthe street he went and ran in at the door of the _Winesburg Eagle_. To\r\nGeorge Willard, who was tramping up and down in the office undergoing a\r\nstruggle of his own, he began to talk half incoherently. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ways of\r\nGod are beyond human understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, running in quickly and\r\nclosing the door. He began to advance upon the young man, his eyes\r\nglowing and his voice ringing with fervor. \xe2\x80\x9cI have found the light,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter ten years in this town, God has manifested himself to me\r\nin the body of a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice dropped and he began to whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndid not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I took to be a trial of my soul was\r\nonly a preparation for a new and more beautiful fervor of the spirit.\r\nGod has appeared to me in the person of Kate Swift, the school teacher,\r\nkneeling naked on a bed. Do you know Kate Swift? Although she may not\r\nbe aware of it, she is an instrument of God, bearing the message of\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReverend Curtis Hartman turned and ran out of the office. At the door\r\nhe stopped, and after looking up and down the deserted street, turned\r\nagain to George Willard. \xe2\x80\x9cI am delivered. Have no fear.\xe2\x80\x9d He held up a\r\nbleeding fist for the young man to see. \xe2\x80\x9cI smashed the glass of the\r\nwindow,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it will have to be wholly replaced. The\r\nstrength of God was in me and I broke it with my fist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEACHER\r\n\r\n\r\nSnow lay deep in the streets of Winesburg. It had begun to snow about\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning and a wind sprang up and blew the snow in\r\nclouds along Main Street. The frozen mud roads that led into town were\r\nfairly smooth and in places ice covered the mud. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be good\r\nsleighing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Will Henderson, standing by the bar in Ed Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaloon. Out of the saloon he went and met Sylvester West the druggist\r\nstumbling along in the kind of heavy overshoes called arctics. \xe2\x80\x9cSnow\r\nwill bring the people into town on Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d said the druggist. The\r\ntwo men stopped and discussed their affairs. Will Henderson, who had on\r\na light overcoat and no overshoes, kicked the heel of his left foot\r\nwith the toe of the right. \xe2\x80\x9cSnow will be good for the wheat,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nthe druggist sagely.\r\n\r\nYoung George Willard, who had nothing to do, was glad because he did\r\nnot feel like working that day. The weekly paper had been printed and\r\ntaken to the post office Wednesday evening and the snow began to fall\r\non Thursday. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after the morning train had passed, he\r\nput a pair of skates in his pocket and went up to Waterworks Pond but\r\ndid not go skating. Past the pond and along a path that followed Wine\r\nCreek he went until he came to a grove of beech trees. There he built a\r\nfire against the side of a log and sat down at the end of the log to\r\nthink. When the snow began to fall and the wind to blow he hurried\r\nabout getting fuel for the fire.\r\n\r\nThe young reporter was thinking of Kate Swift, who had once been his\r\nschool teacher. On the evening before he had gone to her house to get a\r\nbook she wanted him to read and had been alone with her for an hour.\r\nFor the fourth or fifth time the woman had talked to him with great\r\nearnestness and he could not make out what she meant by her talk. He\r\nbegan to believe she must be in love with him and the thought was both\r\npleasing and annoying.\r\n\r\nUp from the log he sprang and began to pile sticks on the fire. Looking\r\nabout to be sure he was alone he talked aloud pretending he was in the\r\npresence of the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re just letting on, you know you are,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to find out about you. You wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man got up and went back along the path toward town leaving\r\nthe fire blazing in the wood. As he went through the streets the skates\r\nclanked in his pocket. In his own room in the New Willard House he\r\nbuilt a fire in the stove and lay down on top of the bed. He began to\r\nhave lustful thoughts and pulling down the shade of the window closed\r\nhis eyes and turned his face to the wall. He took a pillow into his\r\narms and embraced it thinking first of the school teacher, who by her\r\nwords had stirred something within him, and later of Helen White, the\r\nslim daughter of the town banker, with whom he had been for a long time\r\nhalf in love.\r\n\r\nBy nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock of that evening snow lay deep in the streets and the\r\nweather had become bitter cold. It was difficult to walk about. The\r\nstores were dark and the people had crawled away to their houses. The\r\nevening train from Cleveland was very late but nobody was interested in\r\nits arrival. By ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock all but four of the eighteen hundred\r\ncitizens of the town were in bed.\r\n\r\nHop Higgins, the night watchman, was partially awake. He was lame and\r\ncarried a heavy stick. On dark nights he carried a lantern. Between\r\nnine and ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock he went his rounds. Up and down Main Street he\r\nstumbled through the drifts trying the doors of the stores. Then he\r\nwent into alleyways and tried the back doors. Finding all tight he\r\nhurried around the corner to the New Willard House and beat on the\r\ndoor. Through the rest of the night he intended to stay by the stove.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go to bed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the stove going,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the boy who\r\nslept on a cot in the hotel office.\r\n\r\nHop Higgins sat down by the stove and took off his shoes. When the boy\r\nhad gone to sleep he began to think of his own affairs. He intended to\r\npaint his house in the spring and sat by the stove calculating the cost\r\nof paint and labor. That led him into other calculations. The night\r\nwatchman was sixty years old and wanted to retire. He had been a\r\nsoldier in the Civil War and drew a small pension. He hoped to find\r\nsome new method of making a living and aspired to become a professional\r\nbreeder of ferrets. Already he had four of the strangely shaped savage\r\nlittle creatures, that are used by sportsmen in the pursuit of rabbits,\r\nin the cellar of his house. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I have one male and three females,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmused. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am lucky by spring I shall have twelve or fifteen. In\r\nanother year I shall be able to begin advertising ferrets for sale in\r\nthe sporting papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nightwatchman settled into his chair and his mind became a blank.\r\nHe did not sleep. By years of practice he had trained himself to sit\r\nfor hours through the long nights neither asleep nor awake. In the\r\nmorning he was almost as refreshed as though he had slept.\r\n\r\nWith Hop Higgins safely stowed away in the chair behind the stove only\r\nthree people were awake in Winesburg. George Willard was in the office\r\nof the _Eagle_ pretending to be at work on the writing of a story but\r\nin reality continuing the mood of the morning by the fire in the wood.\r\nIn the bell tower of the Presbyterian Church the Reverend Curtis\r\nHartman was sitting in the darkness preparing himself for a revelation\r\nfrom God, and Kate Swift, the school teacher, was leaving her house for\r\na walk in the storm.\r\n\r\nIt was past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Kate Swift set out and the walk was\r\nunpremeditated. It was as though the man and the boy, by thinking of\r\nher, had driven her forth into the wintry streets. Aunt Elizabeth Swift\r\nhad gone to the county seat concerning some business in connection with\r\nmortgages in which she had money invested and would not be back until\r\nthe next day. By a huge stove, called a base burner, in the living room\r\nof the house sat the daughter reading a book. Suddenly she sprang to\r\nher feet and, snatching a cloak from a rack by the front door, ran out\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirty Kate Swift was not known in Winesburg as a pretty\r\nwoman. Her complexion was not good and her face was covered with\r\nblotches that indicated ill health. Alone in the night in the winter\r\nstreets she was lovely. Her back was straight, her shoulders square,\r\nand her features were as the features of a tiny goddess on a pedestal\r\nin a garden in the dim light of a summer evening.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the school teacher had been to see Doctor Welling\r\nconcerning her health. The doctor had scolded her and had declared she\r\nwas in danger of losing her hearing. It was foolish for Kate Swift to\r\nbe abroad in the storm, foolish and perhaps dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe woman in the streets did not remember the words of the doctor and\r\nwould not have turned back had she remembered. She was very cold but\r\nafter walking for five minutes no longer minded the cold. First she\r\nwent to the end of her own street and then across a pair of hay scales\r\nset in the ground before a feed barn and into Trunion Pike. Along\r\nTrunion Pike she went to Ned Winters\xe2\x80\x99 barn and turning east followed a\r\nstreet of low frame houses that led over Gospel Hill and into Sucker\r\nRoad that ran down a shallow valley past Ike Smead\xe2\x80\x99s chicken farm to\r\nWaterworks Pond. As she went along, the bold, excited mood that had\r\ndriven her out of doors passed and then returned again.\r\n\r\nThere was something biting and forbidding in the character of Kate\r\nSwift. Everyone felt it. In the schoolroom she was silent, cold, and\r\nstern, and yet in an odd way very close to her pupils. Once in a long\r\nwhile something seemed to have come over her and she was happy. All of\r\nthe children in the schoolroom felt the effect of her happiness. For a\r\ntime they did not work but sat back in their chairs and looked at her.\r\n\r\nWith hands clasped behind her back the school teacher walked up and\r\ndown in the schoolroom and talked very rapidly. It did not seem to\r\nmatter what subject came into her mind. Once she talked to the children\r\nof Charles Lamb and made up strange, intimate little stories concerning\r\nthe life of the dead writer. The stories were told with the air of one\r\nwho had lived in a house with Charles Lamb and knew all the secrets of\r\nhis private life. The children were somewhat confused, thinking Charles\r\nLamb must be someone who had once lived in Winesburg.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the teacher talked to the children of Benvenuto\r\nCellini. That time they laughed. What a bragging, blustering, brave,\r\nlovable fellow she made of the old artist! Concerning him also she\r\ninvented anecdotes. There was one of a German music teacher who had a\r\nroom above Cellini\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings in the city of Milan that made the boys\r\nguffaw. Sugars McNutts, a fat boy with red cheeks, laughed so hard that\r\nhe became dizzy and fell off his seat and Kate Swift laughed with him.\r\nThen suddenly she became again cold and stern.\r\n\r\nOn the winter night when she walked through the deserted snow-covered\r\nstreets, a crisis had come into the life of the school teacher.\r\nAlthough no one in Winesburg would have suspected it, her life had been\r\nvery adventurous. It was still adventurous. Day by day as she worked in\r\nthe schoolroom or walked in the streets, grief, hope, and desire fought\r\nwithin her. Behind a cold exterior the most extraordinary events\r\ntranspired in her mind. The people of the town thought of her as a\r\nconfirmed old maid and because she spoke sharply and went her own way\r\nthought her lacking in all the human feeling that did so much to make\r\nand mar their own lives. In reality she was the most eagerly passionate\r\nsoul among them, and more than once, in the five years since she had\r\ncome back from her travels to settle in Winesburg and become a school\r\nteacher, had been compelled to go out of the house and walk half\r\nthrough the night fighting out some battle raging within. Once on a\r\nnight when it rained she had stayed out six hours and when she came\r\nhome had a quarrel with Aunt Elizabeth Swift. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you\xe2\x80\x99re not a\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than once I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited for your\r\nfather to come home, not knowing what new mess he had got into. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad my share of uncertainty and you cannot blame me if I do not want to\r\nsee the worst side of him reproduced in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nKate Swift\xe2\x80\x99s mind was ablaze with thoughts of George Willard. In\r\nsomething he had written as a school boy she thought she had recognized\r\nthe spark of genius and wanted to blow on the spark. One day in the\r\nsummer she had gone to the _Eagle_ office and finding the boy\r\nunoccupied had taken him out Main Street to the Fair Ground, where the\r\ntwo sat on a grassy bank and talked. The school teacher tried to bring\r\nhome to the mind of the boy some conception of the difficulties he\r\nwould have to face as a writer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to know life,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndeclared, and her voice trembled with earnestness. She took hold of\r\nGeorge Willard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and turned him about so that she could look\r\ninto his eyes. A passer-by might have thought them about to embrace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are to become a writer you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stop fooling with words,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better to give up the notion of writing\r\nuntil you are better prepared. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to be living. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto frighten you, but I would like to make you understand the import of\r\nwhat you think of attempting. You must not become a mere peddler of\r\nwords. The thing to learn is to know what people are thinking about,\r\nnot what they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the evening before that stormy Thursday night when the Reverend\r\nCurtis Hartman sat in the bell tower of the church waiting to look at\r\nher body, young Willard had gone to visit the teacher and to borrow a\r\nbook. It was then the thing happened that confused and puzzled the boy.\r\nHe had the book under his arm and was preparing to depart. Again Kate\r\nSwift talked with great earnestness. Night was coming on and the light\r\nin the room grew dim. As he turned to go she spoke his name softly and\r\nwith an impulsive movement took hold of his hand. Because the reporter\r\nwas rapidly becoming a man something of his man\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, combined with\r\nthe winsomeness of the boy, stirred the heart of the lonely woman. A\r\npassionate desire to have him understand the import of life, to learn\r\nto interpret it truly and honestly, swept over her. Leaning forward,\r\nher lips brushed his cheek. At the same moment he for the first time\r\nbecame aware of the marked beauty of her features. They were both\r\nembarrassed, and to relieve her feeling she became harsh and\r\ndomineering. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use? It will be ten years before you begin to\r\nunderstand what I mean when I talk to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried passionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of the storm and while the minister sat in the church\r\nwaiting for her, Kate Swift went to the office of the _Winesburg\r\nEagle_, intending to have another talk with the boy. After the long\r\nwalk in the snow she was cold, lonely, and tired. As she came through\r\nMain Street she saw the light from the printshop window shining on the\r\nsnow and on an impulse opened the door and went in. For an hour she sat\r\nby the stove in the office talking of life. She talked with passionate\r\nearnestness. The impulse that had driven her out into the snow poured\r\nitself out into talk. She became inspired as she sometimes did in the\r\npresence of the children in school. A great eagerness to open the door\r\nof life to the boy, who had been her pupil and who she thought might\r\npossess a talent for the understanding of life, had possession of her.\r\nSo strong was her passion that it became something physical. Again her\r\nhands took hold of his shoulders and she turned him about. In the dim\r\nlight her eyes blazed. She arose and laughed, not sharply as was\r\ncustomary with her, but in a queer, hesitating way. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be going,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a moment, if I stay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be wanting to kiss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the newspaper office a confusion arose. Kate Swift turned and walked\r\nto the door. She was a teacher but she was also a woman. As she looked\r\nat George Willard, the passionate desire to be loved by a man, that had\r\na thousand times before swept like a storm over her body, took\r\npossession of her. In the lamplight George Willard looked no longer a\r\nboy, but a man ready to play the part of a man.\r\n\r\nThe school teacher let George Willard take her into his arms. In the\r\nwarm little office the air became suddenly heavy and the strength went\r\nout of her body. Leaning against a low counter by the door she waited.\r\nWhen he came and put a hand on her shoulder she turned and let her body\r\nfall heavily against him. For George Willard the confusion was\r\nimmediately increased. For a moment he held the body of the woman\r\ntightly against his body and then it stiffened. Two sharp little fists\r\nbegan to beat on his face. When the school teacher had run away and\r\nleft him alone, he walked up and down the office swearing furiously.\r\n\r\nIt was into this confusion that the Reverend Curtis Hartman protruded\r\nhimself. When he came in George Willard thought the town had gone mad.\r\nShaking a bleeding fist in the air, the minister proclaimed the woman\r\nGeorge had only a moment before held in his arms an instrument of God\r\nbearing a message of truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge blew out the lamp by the window and locking the door of the\r\nprintshop went home. Through the hotel office, past Hop Higgins lost in\r\nhis dream of the raising of ferrets, he went and up into his own room.\r\nThe fire in the stove had gone out and he undressed in the cold. When\r\nhe got into bed the sheets were like blankets of dry snow.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard rolled about in the bed on which he had lain in the\r\nafternoon hugging the pillow and thinking thoughts of Kate Swift. The\r\nwords of the minister, who he thought had gone suddenly insane, rang in\r\nhis ears. His eyes stared about the room. The resentment, natural to\r\nthe baffled male, passed and he tried to understand what had happened.\r\nHe could not make it out. Over and over he turned the matter in his\r\nmind. Hours passed and he began to think it must be time for another\r\nday to come. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock he pulled the covers up about his neck and\r\ntried to sleep. When he became drowsy and closed his eyes, he raised a\r\nhand and with it groped about in the darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cI have missed\r\nsomething. I have missed something Kate Swift was trying to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe muttered sleepily. Then he slept and in all Winesburg he was the\r\nlast soul on that winter night to go to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONELINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was the son of Mrs. Al Robinson who once owned a farm on a side road\r\nleading off Trunion Pike, east of Winesburg and two miles beyond the\r\ntown limits. The farmhouse was painted brown and the blinds to all of\r\nthe windows facing the road were kept closed. In the road before the\r\nhouse a flock of chickens, accompanied by two guinea hens, lay in the\r\ndeep dust. Enoch lived in the house with his mother in those days and\r\nwhen he was a young boy went to school at the Winesburg High School.\r\nOld citizens remembered him as a quiet, smiling youth inclined to\r\nsilence. He walked in the middle of the road when he came into town and\r\nsometimes read a book. Drivers of teams had to shout and swear to make\r\nhim realize where he was so that he would turn out of the beaten track\r\nand let them pass.\r\n\r\nWhen he was twenty-one years old Enoch went to New York City and was a\r\ncity man for fifteen years. He studied French and went to an art\r\nschool, hoping to develop a faculty he had for drawing. In his own mind\r\nhe planned to go to Paris and to finish his art education among the\r\nmasters there, but that never turned out.\r\n\r\nNothing ever turned out for Enoch Robinson. He could draw well enough\r\nand he had many odd delicate thoughts hidden away in his brain that\r\nmight have expressed themselves through the brush of a painter, but he\r\nwas always a child and that was a handicap to his worldly development.\r\nHe never grew up and of course he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand people and he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make people understand him. The child in him kept bumping\r\nagainst things, against actualities like money and sex and opinions.\r\nOnce he was hit by a street car and thrown against an iron post. That\r\nmade him lame. It was one of the many things that kept things from\r\nturning out for Enoch Robinson.\r\n\r\nIn New York City, when he first went there to live and before he became\r\nconfused and disconcerted by the facts of life, Enoch went about a good\r\ndeal with young men. He got into a group of other young artists, both\r\nmen and women, and in the evenings they sometimes came to visit him in\r\nhis room. Once he got drunk and was taken to a police station where a\r\npolice magistrate frightened him horribly, and once he tried to have an\r\naffair with a woman of the town met on the sidewalk before his lodging\r\nhouse. The woman and Enoch walked together three blocks and then the\r\nyoung man grew afraid and ran away. The woman had been drinking and the\r\nincident amused her. She leaned against the wall of a building and\r\nlaughed so heartily that another man stopped and laughed with her. The\r\ntwo went away together, still laughing, and Enoch crept off to his room\r\ntrembling and vexed.\r\n\r\nThe room in which young Robinson lived in New York faced Washington\r\nSquare and was long and narrow like a hallway. It is important to get\r\nthat fixed in your mind. The story of Enoch is in fact the story of a\r\nroom almost more than it is the story of a man.\r\n\r\nAnd so into the room in the evening came young Enoch\xe2\x80\x99s friends. There\r\nwas nothing particularly striking about them except that they were\r\nartists of the kind that talk. Everyone knows of the talking artists.\r\nThroughout all of the known history of the world they have gathered in\r\nrooms and talked. They talk of art and are passionately, almost\r\nfeverishly, in earnest about it. They think it matters much more than\r\nit does.\r\n\r\nAnd so these people gathered and smoked cigarettes and talked and Enoch\r\nRobinson, the boy from the farm near Winesburg, was there. He stayed in\r\na corner and for the most part said nothing. How his big blue childlike\r\neyes stared about! On the walls were pictures he had made, crude\r\nthings, half finished. His friends talked of these. Leaning back in\r\ntheir chairs, they talked and talked with their heads rocking from side\r\nto side. Words were said about line and values and composition, lots of\r\nwords, such as are always being said.\r\n\r\nEnoch wanted to talk too but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how. He was too excited to\r\ntalk coherently. When he tried he sputtered and stammered and his voice\r\nsounded strange and squeaky to him. That made him stop talking. He knew\r\nwhat he wanted to say, but he knew also that he could never by any\r\npossibility say it. When a picture he had painted was under discussion,\r\nhe wanted to burst out with something like this: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get the\r\npoint,\xe2\x80\x9d he wanted to explain; \xe2\x80\x9cthe picture you see doesn\xe2\x80\x99t consist of\r\nthe things you see and say words about. There is something else,\r\nsomething you don\xe2\x80\x99t see at all, something you aren\xe2\x80\x99t intended to see.\r\nLook at this one over here, by the door here, where the light from the\r\nwindow falls on it. The dark spot by the road that you might not notice\r\nat all is, you see, the beginning of everything. There is a clump of\r\nelders there such as used to grow beside the road before our house back\r\nin Winesburg, Ohio, and in among the elders there is something hidden.\r\nIt is a woman, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. She has been thrown from a horse and\r\nthe horse has run away out of sight. Do you not see how the old man who\r\ndrives a cart looks anxiously about? That is Thad Grayback who has a\r\nfarm up the road. He is taking corn to Winesburg to be ground into meal\r\nat Comstock\xe2\x80\x99s mill. He knows there is something in the elders,\r\nsomething hidden away, and yet he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a woman you see, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is! It\xe2\x80\x99s a woman and, oh, she is\r\nlovely! She is hurt and is suffering but she makes no sound. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee how it is? She lies quite still, white and still, and the beauty\r\ncomes out from her and spreads over everything. It is in the sky back\r\nthere and all around everywhere. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to paint the woman, of\r\ncourse. She is too beautiful to be painted. How dull to talk of\r\ncomposition and such things! Why do you not look at the sky and then\r\nrun away as I used to do when I was a boy back there in Winesburg,\r\nOhio?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is the kind of thing young Enoch Robinson trembled to say to the\r\nguests who came into his room when he was a young fellow in New York\r\nCity, but he always ended by saying nothing. Then he began to doubt his\r\nown mind. He was afraid the things he felt were not getting expressed\r\nin the pictures he painted. In a half indignant mood he stopped\r\ninviting people into his room and presently got into the habit of\r\nlocking the door. He began to think that enough people had visited him,\r\nthat he did not need people any more. With quick imagination he began\r\nto invent his own people to whom he could really talk and to whom he\r\nexplained the things he had been unable to explain to living people.\r\nHis room began to be inhabited by the spirits of men and women among\r\nwhom he went, in his turn saying words. It was as though everyone Enoch\r\nRobinson had ever seen had left with him some essence of himself,\r\nsomething he could mould and change to suit his own fancy, something\r\nthat understood all about such things as the wounded woman behind the\r\nelders in the pictures.\r\n\r\nThe mild, blue-eyed young Ohio boy was a complete egotist, as all\r\nchildren are egotists. He did not want friends for the quite simple\r\nreason that no child wants friends. He wanted most of all the people of\r\nhis own mind, people with whom he could really talk, people he could\r\nharangue and scold by the hour, servants, you see, to his fancy. Among\r\nthese people he was always self-confident and bold. They might talk, to\r\nbe sure, and even have opinions of their own, but always he talked last\r\nand best. He was like a writer busy among the figures of his brain, a\r\nkind of tiny blue-eyed king he was, in a six-dollar room facing\r\nWashington Square in the city of New York.\r\n\r\nThen Enoch Robinson got married. He began to get lonely and to want to\r\ntouch actual flesh-and-bone people with his hands. Days passed when his\r\nroom seemed empty. Lust visited his body and desire grew in his mind.\r\nAt night strange fevers, burning within, kept him awake. He married a\r\ngirl who sat in a chair next to his own in the art school and went to\r\nlive in an apartment house in Brooklyn. Two children were born to the\r\nwoman he married, and Enoch got a job in a place where illustrations\r\nare made for advertisements.\r\n\r\nThat began another phase of Enoch\xe2\x80\x99s life. He began to play at a new\r\ngame. For a while he was very proud of himself in the role of producing\r\ncitizen of the world. He dismissed the essence of things and played\r\nwith realities. In the fall he voted at an election and he had a\r\nnewspaper thrown on his porch each morning. When in the evening he came\r\nhome from work he got off a streetcar and walked sedately along behind\r\nsome business man, striving to look very substantial and important. As\r\na payer of taxes he thought he should post himself on how things are\r\nrun. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting to be of some moment, a real part of things, of the\r\nstate and the city and all that,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself with an amusing\r\nminiature air of dignity. Once, coming home from Philadelphia, he had a\r\ndiscussion with a man met on a train. Enoch talked about the\r\nadvisability of the government\xe2\x80\x99s owning and operating the railroads and\r\nthe man gave him a cigar. It was Enoch\xe2\x80\x99s notion that such a move on the\r\npart of the government would be a good thing, and he grew quite excited\r\nas he talked. Later he remembered his own words with pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave\r\nhim something to think about, that fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself as\r\nhe climbed the stairs to his Brooklyn apartment.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, Enoch\xe2\x80\x99s marriage did not turn out. He himself brought it to\r\nan end. He began to feel choked and walled in by the life in the\r\napartment, and to feel toward his wife and even toward his children as\r\nhe had felt concerning the friends who once came to visit him. He began\r\nto tell little lies about business engagements that would give him\r\nfreedom to walk alone in the street at night and, the chance offering,\r\nhe secretly re-rented the room facing Washington Square. Then Mrs. Al\r\nRobinson died on the farm near Winesburg, and he got eight thousand\r\ndollars from the bank that acted as trustee of her estate. That took\r\nEnoch out of the world of men altogether. He gave the money to his wife\r\nand told her he could not live in the apartment any more. She cried and\r\nwas angry and threatened, but he only stared at her and went his own\r\nway. In reality the wife did not care much. She thought Enoch slightly\r\ninsane and was a little afraid of him. When it was quite sure that he\r\nwould never come back, she took the two children and went to a village\r\nin Connecticut where she had lived as a girl. In the end she married a\r\nman who bought and sold real estate and was contented enough.\r\n\r\nAnd so Enoch Robinson stayed in the New York room among the people of\r\nhis fancy, playing with them, talking to them, happy as a child is\r\nhappy. They were an odd lot, Enoch\xe2\x80\x99s people. They were made, I suppose,\r\nout of real people he had seen and who had for some obscure reason made\r\nan appeal to him. There was a woman with a sword in her hand, an old\r\nman with a long white beard who went about followed by a dog, a young\r\ngirl whose stockings were always coming down and hanging over her shoe\r\ntops. There must have been two dozen of the shadow people, invented by\r\nthe child-mind of Enoch Robinson, who lived in the room with him.\r\n\r\nAnd Enoch was happy. Into the room he went and locked the door. With an\r\nabsurd air of importance he talked aloud, giving instructions, making\r\ncomments on life. He was happy and satisfied to go on making his living\r\nin the advertising place until something happened. Of course something\r\ndid happen. That is why he went back to live in Winesburg and why we\r\nknow about him. The thing that happened was a woman. It would be that\r\nway. He was too happy. Something had to come into his world. Something\r\nhad to drive him out of the New York room to live out his life an\r\nobscure, jerky little figure, bobbing up and down on the streets of an\r\nOhio town at evening when the sun was going down behind the roof of\r\nWesley Moyer\xe2\x80\x99s livery barn.\r\n\r\nAbout the thing that happened. Enoch told George Willard about it one\r\nnight. He wanted to talk to someone, and he chose the young newspaper\r\nreporter because the two happened to be thrown together at a time when\r\nthe younger man was in a mood to understand.\r\n\r\nYouthful sadness, young man\xe2\x80\x99s sadness, the sadness of a growing boy in\r\na village at the year\xe2\x80\x99s end, opened the lips of the old man. The\r\nsadness was in the heart of George Willard and was without meaning, but\r\nit appealed to Enoch Robinson.\r\n\r\nIt rained on the evening when the two met and talked, a drizzly wet\r\nOctober rain. The fruition of the year had come and the night should\r\nhave been fine with a moon in the sky and the crisp sharp promise of\r\nfrost in the air, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that way. It rained and little puddles\r\nof water shone under the street lamps on Main Street. In the woods in\r\nthe darkness beyond the Fair Ground water dripped from the black trees.\r\nBeneath the trees wet leaves were pasted against tree roots that\r\nprotruded from the ground. In gardens back of houses in Winesburg dry\r\nshriveled potato vines lay sprawling on the ground. Men who had\r\nfinished the evening meal and who had planned to go uptown to talk the\r\nevening away with other men at the back of some store changed their\r\nminds. George Willard tramped about in the rain and was glad that it\r\nrained. He felt that way. He was like Enoch Robinson on the evenings\r\nwhen the old man came down out of his room and wandered alone in the\r\nstreets. He was like that only that George Willard had become a tall\r\nyoung man and did not think it manly to weep and carry on. For a month\r\nhis mother had been very ill and that had something to do with his\r\nsadness, but not much. He thought about himself and to the young that\r\nalways brings sadness.\r\n\r\nEnoch Robinson and George Willard met beneath a wooden awning that\r\nextended out over the sidewalk before Voight\xe2\x80\x99s wagon shop on Maumee\r\nStreet just off the main street of Winesburg. They went together from\r\nthere through the rain-washed streets to the older man\xe2\x80\x99s room on the\r\nthird floor of the Heffner Block. The young reporter went willingly\r\nenough. Enoch Robinson asked him to go after the two had talked for ten\r\nminutes. The boy was a little afraid but had never been more curious in\r\nhis life. A hundred times he had heard the old man spoken of as a\r\nlittle off his head and he thought himself rather brave and manly to go\r\nat all. From the very beginning, in the street in the rain, the old man\r\ntalked in a queer way, trying to tell the story of the room in\r\nWashington Square and of his life in the room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll understand if\r\nyou try hard enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said conclusively. \xe2\x80\x9cI have looked at you when\r\nyou went past me on the street and I think you can understand. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhard. All you have to do is to believe what I say, just listen and\r\nbelieve, that\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening when old Enoch, talking to\r\nGeorge Willard in the room in the Heffner Block, came to the vital\r\nthing, the story of the woman and of what drove him out of the city to\r\nlive out his life alone and defeated in Winesburg. He sat on a cot by\r\nthe window with his head in his hand and George Willard was in a chair\r\nby a table. A kerosene lamp sat on the table and the room, although\r\nalmost bare of furniture, was scrupulously clean. As the man talked\r\nGeorge Willard began to feel that he would like to get out of the chair\r\nand sit on the cot also. He wanted to put his arms about the little old\r\nman. In the half darkness the man talked and the boy listened, filled\r\nwith sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe got to coming in there after there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been anyone in the room\r\nfor years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Enoch Robinson. \xe2\x80\x9cShe saw me in the hallway of the\r\nhouse and we got acquainted. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know just what she did in her own\r\nroom. I never went there. I think she was a musician and played a\r\nviolin. Every now and then she came and knocked at the door and I\r\nopened it. In she came and sat down beside me, just sat and looked\r\nabout and said nothing. Anyway, she said nothing that mattered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man arose from the cot and moved about the room. The overcoat\r\nhe wore was wet from the rain and drops of water kept falling with a\r\nsoft thump on the floor. When he again sat upon the cot George Willard\r\ngot out of the chair and sat beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a feeling about her. She sat there in the room with me and she\r\nwas too big for the room. I felt that she was driving everything else\r\naway. We just talked of little things, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit still. I\r\nwanted to touch her with my fingers and to kiss her. Her hands were so\r\nstrong and her face was so good and she looked at me all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trembling voice of the old man became silent and his body shook as\r\nfrom a chill. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI was terribly afraid. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to let her come in when she knocked at the door but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit still. \xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself, but I got up and opened\r\nthe door just the same. She was so grown up, you see. She was a woman.\r\nI thought she would be bigger than I was there in that room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEnoch Robinson stared at George Willard, his childlike blue eyes\r\nshining in the lamplight. Again he shivered. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted her and all the\r\ntime I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I began to tell her about\r\nmy people, about everything that meant anything to me. I tried to keep\r\nquiet, to keep myself to myself, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I felt just as I did\r\nabout opening the door. Sometimes I ached to have her go away and never\r\ncome back any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man sprang to his feet and his voice shook with excitement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night something happened. I became mad to make her understand me\r\nand to know what a big thing I was in that room. I wanted her to see\r\nhow important I was. I told her over and over. When she tried to go\r\naway, I ran and locked the door. I followed her about. I talked and\r\ntalked and then all of a sudden things went to smash. A look came into\r\nher eyes and I knew she did understand. Maybe she had understood all\r\nthe time. I was furious. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. I wanted her to\r\nunderstand but, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let her understand. I felt\r\nthat then she would know everything, that I would be submerged, drowned\r\nout, you see. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man dropped into a chair by the lamp and the boy listened,\r\nfilled with awe. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stay here with me\r\nany more. I thought it might be a good thing to tell you but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk any more. Go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard shook his head and a note of command came into his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop now. Tell me the rest of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded sharply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened? Tell me the rest of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEnoch Robinson sprang to his feet and ran to the window that looked\r\ndown into the deserted main street of Winesburg. George Willard\r\nfollowed. By the window the two stood, the tall awkward boy-man and the\r\nlittle wrinkled man-boy. The childish, eager voice carried forward the\r\ntale. \xe2\x80\x9cI swore at her,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI said vile words. I ordered her\r\nto go away and not to come back. Oh, I said terrible things. At first\r\nshe pretended not to understand but I kept at it. I screamed and\r\nstamped on the floor. I made the house ring with my curses. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant ever to see her again and I knew, after some of the things I said,\r\nthat I never would see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s voice broke and he shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThings went to\r\nsmash,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly and sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cOut she went through the door and\r\nall the life there had been in the room followed her out. She took all\r\nof my people away. They all went out through the door after her. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe way it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard turned and went out of Enoch Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s room. In the\r\ndarkness by the window, as he went through the door, he could hear the\r\nthin old voice whimpering and complaining. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m alone, all alone here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was warm and friendly in my room but now I\xe2\x80\x99m all\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AWAKENING\r\n\r\n\r\nBelle Carpenter had a dark skin, grey eyes, and thick lips. She was\r\ntall and strong. When black thoughts visited her she grew angry and\r\nwished she were a man and could fight someone with her fists. She\r\nworked in the millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate McHugh and during the\r\nday sat trimming hats by a window at the rear of the store. She was the\r\ndaughter of Henry Carpenter, bookkeeper in the First National Bank of\r\nWinesburg, and lived with him in a gloomy old house far out at the end\r\nof Buckeye Street. The house was surrounded by pine trees and there was\r\nno grass beneath the trees. A rusty tin eaves-trough had slipped from\r\nits fastenings at the back of the house and when the wind blew it beat\r\nagainst the roof of a small shed, making a dismal drumming noise that\r\nsometimes persisted all through the night.\r\n\r\nWhen she was a young girl Henry Carpenter made life almost unbearable\r\nfor Belle, but as she emerged from girlhood into womanhood he lost his\r\npower over her. The bookkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s life was made up of innumerable little\r\npettinesses. When he went to the bank in the morning he stepped into a\r\ncloset and put on a black alpaca coat that had become shabby with age.\r\nAt night when he returned to his home he donned another black alpaca\r\ncoat. Every evening he pressed the clothes worn in the streets. He had\r\ninvented an arrangement of boards for the purpose. The trousers to his\r\nstreet suit were placed between the boards and the boards were clamped\r\ntogether with heavy screws. In the morning he wiped the boards with a\r\ndamp cloth and stood them upright behind the dining room door. If they\r\nwere moved during the day he was speechless with anger and did not\r\nrecover his equilibrium for a week.\r\n\r\nThe bank cashier was a little bully and was afraid of his daughter.\r\nShe, he realized, knew the story of his brutal treatment of her mother\r\nand hated him for it. One day she went home at noon and carried a\r\nhandful of soft mud, taken from the road, into the house. With the mud\r\nshe smeared the face of the boards used for the pressing of trousers\r\nand then went back to her work feeling relieved and happy.\r\n\r\nBelle Carpenter occasionally walked out in the evening with George\r\nWillard. Secretly she loved another man, but her love affair, about\r\nwhich no one knew, caused her much anxiety. She was in love with Ed\r\nHandby, bartender in Ed Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s Saloon, and went about with the\r\nyoung reporter as a kind of relief to her feelings. She did not think\r\nthat her station in life would permit her to be seen in the company of\r\nthe bartender and walked about under the trees with George Willard and\r\nlet him kiss her to relieve a longing that was very insistent in her\r\nnature. She felt that she could keep the younger man within bounds.\r\nAbout Ed Handby she was somewhat uncertain.\r\n\r\nHandby, the bartender, was a tall, broad-shouldered man of thirty who\r\nlived in a room upstairs above Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s saloon. His fists were large\r\nand his eyes unusually small, but his voice, as though striving to\r\nconceal the power back of his fists, was soft and quiet.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-five the bartender had inherited a large farm from an uncle\r\nin Indiana. When sold, the farm brought in eight thousand dollars,\r\nwhich Ed spent in six months. Going to Sandusky, on Lake Erie, he began\r\nan orgy of dissipation, the story of which afterward filled his home\r\ntown with awe. Here and there he went throwing the money about, driving\r\ncarriages through the streets, giving wine parties to crowds of men and\r\nwomen, playing cards for high stakes and keeping mistresses whose\r\nwardrobes cost him hundreds of dollars. One night at a resort called\r\nCedar Point, he got into a fight and ran amuck like a wild thing. With\r\nhis fist he broke a large mirror in the wash room of a hotel and later\r\nwent about smashing windows and breaking chairs in dance halls for the\r\njoy of hearing the glass rattle on the floor and seeing the terror in\r\nthe eyes of clerks who had come from Sandusky to spend the evening at\r\nthe resort with their sweethearts.\r\n\r\nThe affair between Ed Handby and Belle Carpenter on the surface\r\namounted to nothing. He had succeeded in spending but one evening in\r\nher company. On that evening he hired a horse and buggy at Wesley\r\nMoyer\xe2\x80\x99s livery barn and took her for a drive. The conviction that she\r\nwas the woman his nature demanded and that he must get her settled upon\r\nhim and he told her of his desires. The bartender was ready to marry\r\nand to begin trying to earn money for the support of his wife, but so\r\nsimple was his nature that he found it difficult to explain his\r\nintentions. His body ached with physical longing and with his body he\r\nexpressed himself. Taking the milliner into his arms and holding her\r\ntightly in spite of her struggles, he kissed her until she became\r\nhelpless. Then he brought her back to town and let her out of the\r\nbuggy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get hold of you again I\xe2\x80\x99ll not let you go. You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nplay with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared as he turned to drive away. Then, jumping\r\nout of the buggy, he gripped her shoulders with his strong hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkeep you for good the next time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well make up\r\nyour mind to that. It\xe2\x80\x99s you and me for it and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have you\r\nbefore I get through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne night in January when there was a new moon George Willard, who was\r\nin Ed Handby\xe2\x80\x99s mind the only obstacle to his getting Belle Carpenter,\r\nwent for a walk. Early that evening George went into Ransom Surbeck\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npool room with Seth Richmond and Art Wilson, son of the town butcher.\r\nSeth Richmond stood with his back against the wall and remained silent,\r\nbut George Willard talked. The pool room was filled with Winesburg boys\r\nand they talked of women. The young reporter got into that vein. He\r\nsaid that women should look out for themselves, that the fellow who\r\nwent out with a girl was not responsible for what happened. As he\r\ntalked he looked about, eager for attention. He held the floor for five\r\nminutes and then Art Wilson began to talk. Art was learning the\r\nbarber\xe2\x80\x99s trade in Cal Prouse\xe2\x80\x99s shop and already began to consider\r\nhimself an authority in such matters as baseball, horse racing,\r\ndrinking, and going about with women. He began to tell of a night when\r\nhe with two men from Winesburg went into a house of prostitution at the\r\ncounty seat. The butcher\xe2\x80\x99s son held a cigar in the side of his mouth\r\nand as he talked spat on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe women in the place couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nembarrass me although they tried hard enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he boasted. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the\r\ngirls in the house tried to get fresh, but I fooled her. As soon as she\r\nbegan to talk I went and sat in her lap. Everyone in the room laughed\r\nwhen I kissed her. I taught her to let me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard went out of the pool room and into Main Street. For days\r\nthe weather had been bitter cold with a high wind blowing down on the\r\ntown from Lake Erie, eighteen miles to the north, but on that night the\r\nwind had died away and a new moon made the night unusually lovely.\r\nWithout thinking where he was going or what he wanted to do, George\r\nwent out of Main Street and began walking in dimly lighted streets\r\nfilled with frame houses.\r\n\r\nOut of doors under the black sky filled with stars he forgot his\r\ncompanions of the pool room. Because it was dark and he was alone he\r\nbegan to talk aloud. In a spirit of play he reeled along the street\r\nimitating a drunken man and then imagined himself a soldier clad in\r\nshining boots that reached to the knees and wearing a sword that\r\njingled as he walked. As a soldier he pictured himself as an inspector,\r\npassing before a long line of men who stood at attention. He began to\r\nexamine the accoutrements of the men. Before a tree he stopped and\r\nbegan to scold. \xe2\x80\x9cYour pack is not in order,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many\r\ntimes will I have to speak of this matter? Everything must be in order\r\nhere. We have a difficult task before us and no difficult task can be\r\ndone without order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHypnotized by his own words, the young man stumbled along the board\r\nsidewalk saying more words. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a law for armies and for men\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, lost in reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cThe law begins with little\r\nthings and spreads out until it covers everything. In every little\r\nthing there must be order, in the place where men work, in their\r\nclothes, in their thoughts. I myself must be orderly. I must learn that\r\nlaw. I must get myself into touch with something orderly and big that\r\nswings through the night like a star. In my little way I must begin to\r\nlearn something, to give and swing and work with life, with the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard stopped by a picket fence near a street lamp and his\r\nbody began to tremble. He had never before thought such thoughts as had\r\njust come into his head and he wondered where they had come from. For\r\nthe moment it seemed to him that some voice outside of himself had been\r\ntalking as he walked. He was amazed and delighted with his own mind and\r\nwhen he walked on again spoke of the matter with fervor. \xe2\x80\x9cTo come out\r\nof Ransom Surbeck\xe2\x80\x99s pool room and think things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is better to be alone. If I talked like Art Wilson the\r\nboys would understand me but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nthinking down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Winesburg, as in all Ohio towns of twenty years ago, there was a\r\nsection in which lived day laborers. As the time of factories had not\r\nyet come, the laborers worked in the fields or were section hands on\r\nthe railroads. They worked twelve hours a day and received one dollar\r\nfor the long day of toil. The houses in which they lived were small\r\ncheaply constructed wooden affairs with a garden at the back. The more\r\ncomfortable among them kept cows and perhaps a pig, housed in a little\r\nshed at the rear of the garden.\r\n\r\nWith his head filled with resounding thoughts, George Willard walked\r\ninto such a street on the clear January night. The street was dimly\r\nlighted and in places there was no sidewalk. In the scene that lay\r\nabout him there was something that excited his already aroused fancy.\r\nFor a year he had been devoting all of his odd moments to the reading\r\nof books and now some tale he had read concerning life in old world\r\ntowns of the middle ages came sharply back to his mind so that he\r\nstumbled forward with the curious feeling of one revisiting a place\r\nthat had been a part of some former existence. On an impulse he turned\r\nout of the street and went into a little dark alleyway behind the sheds\r\nin which lived the cows and pigs.\r\n\r\nFor a half hour he stayed in the alleyway, smelling the strong smell of\r\nanimals too closely housed and letting his mind play with the strange\r\nnew thoughts that came to him. The very rankness of the smell of manure\r\nin the clear sweet air awoke something heady in his brain. The poor\r\nlittle houses lighted by kerosene lamps, the smoke from the chimneys\r\nmounting straight up into the clear air, the grunting of pigs, the\r\nwomen clad in cheap calico dresses and washing dishes in the kitchens,\r\nthe footsteps of men coming out of the houses and going off to the\r\nstores and saloons of Main Street, the dogs barking and the children\r\ncrying\xe2\x80\x94all of these things made him seem, as he lurked in the darkness,\r\noddly detached and apart from all life.\r\n\r\nThe excited young man, unable to bear the weight of his own thoughts,\r\nbegan to move cautiously along the alleyway. A dog attacked him and had\r\nto be driven away with stones, and a man appeared at the door of one of\r\nthe houses and swore at the dog. George went into a vacant lot and\r\nthrowing back his head looked up at the sky. He felt unutterably big\r\nand remade by the simple experience through which he had been passing\r\nand in a kind of fervor of emotion put up his hands, thrusting them\r\ninto the darkness above his head and muttering words. The desire to say\r\nwords overcame him and he said words without meaning, rolling them over\r\non his tongue and saying them because they were brave words, full of\r\nmeaning. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cnight, the sea, fear, loveliness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard came out of the vacant lot and stood again on the\r\nsidewalk facing the houses. He felt that all of the people in the\r\nlittle street must be brothers and sisters to him and he wished he had\r\nthe courage to call them out of their houses and to shake their hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there were only a woman here I would take hold of her hand and we\r\nwould run until we were both tired out,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would make\r\nme feel better.\xe2\x80\x9d With the thought of a woman in his mind he walked out\r\nof the street and went toward the house where Belle Carpenter lived. He\r\nthought she would understand his mood and that he could achieve in her\r\npresence a position he had long been wanting to achieve. In the past\r\nwhen he had been with her and had kissed her lips he had come away\r\nfilled with anger at himself. He had felt like one being used for some\r\nobscure purpose and had not enjoyed the feeling. Now he thought he had\r\nsuddenly become too big to be used.\r\n\r\nWhen George got to Belle Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s house there had already been a\r\nvisitor there before him. Ed Handby had come to the door and calling\r\nBelle out of the house had tried to talk to her. He had wanted to ask\r\nthe woman to come away with him and to be his wife, but when she came\r\nand stood by the door he lost his self-assurance and became sullen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stay away from that kid,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled, thinking of George Willard,\r\nand then, not knowing what else to say, turned to go away. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I catch\r\nyou together I will break your bones and his too,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. The\r\nbartender had come to woo, not to threaten, and was angry with himself\r\nbecause of his failure.\r\n\r\nWhen her lover had departed Belle went indoors and ran hurriedly\r\nupstairs. From a window at the upper part of the house she saw Ed\r\nHandby cross the street and sit down on a horse block before the house\r\nof a neighbor. In the dim light the man sat motionless holding his head\r\nin his hands. She was made happy by the sight, and when George Willard\r\ncame to the door she greeted him effusively and hurriedly put on her\r\nhat. She thought that, as she walked through the streets with young\r\nWillard, Ed Handby would follow and she wanted to make him suffer.\r\n\r\nFor an hour Belle Carpenter and the young reporter walked about under\r\nthe trees in the sweet night air. George Willard was full of big words.\r\nThe sense of power that had come to him during the hour in the darkness\r\nin the alleyway remained with him and he talked boldly, swaggering\r\nalong and swinging his arms about. He wanted to make Belle Carpenter\r\nrealize that he was aware of his former weakness and that he had\r\nchanged. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find me different,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, thrusting his hands\r\ninto his pockets and looking boldly into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why\r\nbut it is so. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take me for a man or let me alone. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhow it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp and down the quiet streets under the new moon went the woman and the\r\nboy. When George had finished talking they turned down a side street\r\nand went across a bridge into a path that ran up the side of a hill.\r\nThe hill began at Waterworks Pond and climbed upward to the Winesburg\r\nFair Grounds. On the hillside grew dense bushes and small trees and\r\namong the bushes were little open spaces carpeted with long grass, now\r\nstiff and frozen.\r\n\r\nAs he walked behind the woman up the hill George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s heart began\r\nto beat rapidly and his shoulders straightened. Suddenly he decided\r\nthat Belle Carpenter was about to surrender herself to him. The new\r\nforce that had manifested itself in him had, he felt, been at work upon\r\nher and had led to her conquest. The thought made him half drunk with\r\nthe sense of masculine power. Although he had been annoyed that as they\r\nwalked about she had not seemed to be listening to his words, the fact\r\nthat she had accompanied him to this place took all his doubts away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is different. Everything has become different,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought and\r\ntaking hold of her shoulder turned her about and stood looking at her,\r\nhis eyes shining with pride.\r\n\r\nBelle Carpenter did not resist. When he kissed her upon the lips she\r\nleaned heavily against him and looked over his shoulder into the\r\ndarkness. In her whole attitude there was a suggestion of waiting.\r\nAgain, as in the alleyway, George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s mind ran off into words\r\nand, holding the woman tightly he whispered the words into the still\r\nnight. \xe2\x80\x9cLust,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9clust and night and women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard did not understand what happened to him that night on\r\nthe hillside. Later, when he got to his own room, he wanted to weep and\r\nthen grew half insane with anger and hate. He hated Belle Carpenter and\r\nwas sure that all his life he would continue to hate her. On the\r\nhillside he had led the woman to one of the little open spaces among\r\nthe bushes and had dropped to his knees beside her. As in the vacant\r\nlot, by the laborers\xe2\x80\x99 houses, he had put up his hands in gratitude for\r\nthe new power in himself and was waiting for the woman to speak when Ed\r\nHandby appeared.\r\n\r\nThe bartender did not want to beat the boy, who he thought had tried to\r\ntake his woman away. He knew that beating was unnecessary, that he had\r\npower within himself to accomplish his purpose without using his fists.\r\nGripping George by the shoulder and pulling him to his feet, he held\r\nhim with one hand while he looked at Belle Carpenter seated on the\r\ngrass. Then with a quick wide movement of his arm he sent the younger\r\nman sprawling away into the bushes and began to bully the woman, who\r\nhad risen to her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re no good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said roughly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve half a\r\nmind not to bother with you. I\xe2\x80\x99d let you alone if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you so\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn his hands and knees in the bushes George Willard stared at the scene\r\nbefore him and tried hard to think. He prepared to spring at the man\r\nwho had humiliated him. To be beaten seemed to be infinitely better\r\nthan to be thus hurled ignominiously aside.\r\n\r\nThree times the young reporter sprang at Ed Handby and each time the\r\nbartender, catching him by the shoulder, hurled him back into the\r\nbushes. The older man seemed prepared to keep the exercise going\r\nindefinitely but George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s head struck the root of a tree and he\r\nlay still. Then Ed Handby took Belle Carpenter by the arm and marched\r\nher away.\r\n\r\nGeorge heard the man and woman making their way through the bushes. As\r\nhe crept down the hillside his heart was sick within him. He hated\r\nhimself and he hated the fate that had brought about his humiliation.\r\nWhen his mind went back to the hour alone in the alleyway he was\r\npuzzled and stopping in the darkness listened, hoping to hear again the\r\nvoice outside himself that had so short a time before put new courage\r\ninto his heart. When his way homeward led him again into the street of\r\nframe houses he could not bear the sight and began to run, wanting to\r\nget quickly out of the neighborhood that now seemed to him utterly\r\nsqualid and commonplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQUEER\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom his seat on a box in the rough board shed that stuck like a burr\r\non the rear of Cowley & Son\xe2\x80\x99s store in Winesburg, Elmer Cowley, the\r\njunior member of the firm, could see through a dirty window into the\r\nprintshop of the _Winesburg Eagle_. Elmer was putting new shoelaces in\r\nhis shoes. They did not go in readily and he had to take the shoes off.\r\nWith the shoes in his hand he sat looking at a large hole in the heel\r\nof one of his stockings. Then looking quickly up he saw George Willard,\r\nthe only newspaper reporter in Winesburg, standing at the back door of\r\nthe _Eagle_ printshop and staring absentmindedly about. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\r\nwhat next!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young man with the shoes in his hand, jumping\r\nto his feet and creeping away from the window.\r\n\r\nA flush crept into Elmer Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s face and his hands began to tremble.\r\nIn Cowley & Son\xe2\x80\x99s store a Jewish traveling salesman stood by the\r\ncounter talking to his father. He imagined the reporter could hear what\r\nwas being said and the thought made him furious. With one of the shoes\r\nstill held in his hand he stood in a corner of the shed and stamped\r\nwith a stockinged foot upon the board floor.\r\n\r\nCowley & Son\xe2\x80\x99s store did not face the main street of Winesburg. The\r\nfront was on Maumee Street and beyond it was Voight\xe2\x80\x99s wagon shop and a\r\nshed for the sheltering of farmers\xe2\x80\x99 horses. Beside the store an\r\nalleyway ran behind the main street stores and all day drays and\r\ndelivery wagons, intent on bringing in and taking out goods, passed up\r\nand down. The store itself was indescribable. Will Henderson once said\r\nof it that it sold everything and nothing. In the window facing Maumee\r\nStreet stood a chunk of coal as large as an apple barrel, to indicate\r\nthat orders for coal were taken, and beside the black mass of the coal\r\nstood three combs of honey grown brown and dirty in their wooden\r\nframes.\r\n\r\nThe honey had stood in the store window for six months. It was for sale\r\nas were also the coat hangers, patent suspender buttons, cans of roof\r\npaint, bottles of rheumatism cure, and a substitute for coffee that\r\ncompanioned the honey in its patient willingness to serve the public.\r\n\r\nEbenezer Cowley, the man who stood in the store listening to the eager\r\npatter of words that fell from the lips of the traveling man, was tall\r\nand lean and looked unwashed. On his scrawny neck was a large wen\r\npartially covered by a grey beard. He wore a long Prince Albert coat.\r\nThe coat had been purchased to serve as a wedding garment. Before he\r\nbecame a merchant Ebenezer was a farmer and after his marriage he wore\r\nthe Prince Albert coat to church on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons\r\nwhen he came into town to trade. When he sold the farm to become a\r\nmerchant he wore the coat constantly. It had become brown with age and\r\nwas covered with grease spots, but in it Ebenezer always felt dressed\r\nup and ready for the day in town.\r\n\r\nAs a merchant Ebenezer was not happily placed in life and he had not\r\nbeen happily placed as a farmer. Still he existed. His family,\r\nconsisting of a daughter named Mabel and the son, lived with him in\r\nrooms above the store and it did not cost them much to live. His\r\ntroubles were not financial. His unhappiness as a merchant lay in the\r\nfact that when a traveling man with wares to be sold came in at the\r\nfront door he was afraid. Behind the counter he stood shaking his head.\r\nHe was afraid, first that he would stubbornly refuse to buy and thus\r\nlose the opportunity to sell again; second that he would not be\r\nstubborn enough and would in a moment of weakness buy what could not be\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nIn the store on the morning when Elmer Cowley saw George Willard\r\nstanding and apparently listening at the back door of the _Eagle_\r\nprintshop, a situation had arisen that always stirred the son\xe2\x80\x99s wrath.\r\nThe traveling man talked and Ebenezer listened, his whole figure\r\nexpressing uncertainty. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see how quickly it is done,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ntraveling man, who had for sale a small flat metal substitute for\r\ncollar buttons. With one hand he quickly unfastened a collar from his\r\nshirt and then fastened it on again. He assumed a flattering wheedling\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, men have come to the end of all this fooling\r\nwith collar buttons and you are the man to make money out of the change\r\nthat is coming. I am offering you the exclusive agency for this town.\r\nTake twenty dozen of these fasteners and I\xe2\x80\x99ll not visit any other\r\nstore. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the field to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe traveling man leaned over the counter and tapped with his finger on\r\nEbenezer\xe2\x80\x99s breast. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity and I want you to take it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nurged. \xe2\x80\x9cA friend of mine told me about you. \xe2\x80\x98See that man Cowley,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a live one.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe traveling man paused and waited. Taking a book from his pocket he\r\nbegan writing out the order. Still holding the shoe in his hand Elmer\r\nCowley went through the store, past the two absorbed men, to a glass\r\nshowcase near the front door. He took a cheap revolver from the case\r\nand began to wave it about. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get out of here!\xe2\x80\x9d he shrieked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want any collar fasteners here.\xe2\x80\x9d An idea came to him. \xe2\x80\x9cMind, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot making any threat,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot. Maybe I just\r\ntook this gun out of the case to look at it. But you better get out.\r\nYes sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that. You better grab up your things and get out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young storekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s voice rose to a scream and going behind the\r\ncounter he began to advance upon the two men. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re through being\r\nfools here!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to buy any more stuff until we\r\nbegin to sell. We ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to keep on being queer and have folks\r\nstaring and listening. You get out of here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe traveling man left. Raking the samples of collar fasteners off the\r\ncounter into a black leather bag, he ran. He was a small man and very\r\nbow-legged and he ran awkwardly. The black bag caught against the door\r\nand he stumbled and fell. \xe2\x80\x9cCrazy, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he is\xe2\x80\x94crazy!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsputtered as he arose from the sidewalk and hurried away.\r\n\r\nIn the store Elmer Cowley and his father stared at each other. Now that\r\nthe immediate object of his wrath had fled, the younger man was\r\nembarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I meant it. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been queer long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe declared, going to the showcase and replacing the revolver. Sitting\r\non a barrel he pulled on and fastened the shoe he had been holding in\r\nhis hand. He was waiting for some word of understanding from his father\r\nbut when Ebenezer spoke his words only served to reawaken the wrath in\r\nthe son and the young man ran out of the store without replying.\r\nScratching his grey beard with his long dirty fingers, the merchant\r\nlooked at his son with the same wavering uncertain stare with which he\r\nhad confronted the traveling man. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be starched,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be washed and ironed and starched!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElmer Cowley went out of Winesburg and along a country road that\r\nparalleled the railroad track. He did not know where he was going or\r\nwhat he was going to do. In the shelter of a deep cut where the road,\r\nafter turning sharply to the right, dipped under the tracks he stopped\r\nand the passion that had been the cause of his outburst in the store\r\nbegan to again find expression. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not be queer\xe2\x80\x94one to be looked\r\nat and listened to,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be like other people.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show that George Willard. He\xe2\x80\x99ll find out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distraught young man stood in the middle of the road and glared\r\nback at the town. He did not know the reporter George Willard and had\r\nno special feeling concerning the tall boy who ran about town gathering\r\nthe town news. The reporter had merely come, by his presence in the\r\noffice and in the printshop of the _Winesburg Eagle_, to stand for\r\nsomething in the young merchant\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He thought the boy who passed\r\nand repassed Cowley & Son\xe2\x80\x99s store and who stopped to talk to people in\r\nthe street must be thinking of him and perhaps laughing at him. George\r\nWillard, he felt, belonged to the town, typified the town, represented\r\nin his person the spirit of the town. Elmer Cowley could not have\r\nbelieved that George Willard had also his days of unhappiness, that\r\nvague hungers and secret unnamable desires visited also his mind. Did\r\nhe not represent public opinion and had not the public opinion of\r\nWinesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness? Did he not walk whistling\r\nand laughing through Main Street? Might not one by striking his person\r\nstrike also the greater enemy\xe2\x80\x94the thing that smiled and went its own\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94the judgment of Winesburg?\r\n\r\nElmer Cowley was extraordinarily tall and his arms were long and\r\npowerful. His hair, his eyebrows, and the downy beard that had begun to\r\ngrow upon his chin, were pale almost to whiteness. His teeth protruded\r\nfrom between his lips and his eyes were blue with the colorless\r\nblueness of the marbles called \xe2\x80\x9caggies\xe2\x80\x9d that the boys of Winesburg\r\ncarried in their pockets. Elmer had lived in Winesburg for a year and\r\nhad made no friends. He was, he felt, one condemned to go through life\r\nwithout friends and he hated the thought.\r\n\r\nSullenly the tall young man tramped along the road with his hands\r\nstuffed into his trouser pockets. The day was cold with a raw wind, but\r\npresently the sun began to shine and the road became soft and muddy.\r\nThe tops of the ridges of frozen mud that formed the road began to melt\r\nand the mud clung to Elmer\xe2\x80\x99s shoes. His feet became cold. When he had\r\ngone several miles he turned off the road, crossed a field and entered\r\na wood. In the wood he gathered sticks to build a fire, by which he sat\r\ntrying to warm himself, miserable in body and in mind.\r\n\r\nFor two hours he sat on the log by the fire and then, arising and\r\ncreeping cautiously through a mass of underbrush, he went to a fence\r\nand looked across fields to a small farmhouse surrounded by low sheds.\r\nA smile came to his lips and he began making motions with his long arms\r\nto a man who was husking corn in one of the fields.\r\n\r\nIn his hour of misery the young merchant had returned to the farm where\r\nhe had lived through boyhood and where there was another human being to\r\nwhom he felt he could explain himself. The man on the farm was a\r\nhalf-witted old fellow named Mook. He had once been employed by\r\nEbenezer Cowley and had stayed on the farm when it was sold. The old\r\nman lived in one of the unpainted sheds back of the farmhouse and\r\nputtered about all day in the fields.\r\n\r\nMook the half-wit lived happily. With childlike faith he believed in\r\nthe intelligence of the animals that lived in the sheds with him, and\r\nwhen he was lonely held long conversations with the cows, the pigs, and\r\neven with the chickens that ran about the barnyard. He it was who had\r\nput the expression regarding being \xe2\x80\x9claundered\xe2\x80\x9d into the mouth of his\r\nformer employer. When excited or surprised by anything he smiled\r\nvaguely and muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be washed and ironed. Well, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nwashed and ironed and starched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the half-witted old man left his husking of corn and came into the\r\nwood to meet Elmer Cowley, he was neither surprised nor especially\r\ninterested in the sudden appearance of the young man. His feet also\r\nwere cold and he sat on the log by the fire, grateful for the warmth\r\nand apparently indifferent to what Elmer had to say.\r\n\r\nElmer talked earnestly and with great freedom, walking up and down and\r\nwaving his arms about. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me\r\nso of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWith me it\xe2\x80\x99s different.\r\nLook how it has always been with me. Father is queer and mother was\r\nqueer, too. Even the clothes mother used to wear were not like other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, and look at that coat in which father goes about\r\nthere in town, thinking he\xe2\x80\x99s dressed up, too. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t he get a new\r\none? It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost much. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why. Father doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know and\r\nwhen mother was alive she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know either. Mabel is different. She\r\nknows but she won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. I will, though. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be\r\nstared at any longer. Why look here, Mook, father doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that his\r\nstore there in town is just a queer jumble, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll never sell the\r\nstuff he buys. He knows nothing about it. Sometimes he\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\nworried that trade doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come and then he goes and buys something\r\nelse. In the evenings he sits by the fire upstairs and says trade will\r\ncome after a while. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t worried. He\xe2\x80\x99s queer. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nenough to be worried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe excited young man became more excited. \xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t know but I know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe shouted, stopping to gaze down into the dumb, unresponsive face of\r\nthe half-wit. \xe2\x80\x9cI know too well. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. When we lived out\r\nhere it was different. I worked and at night I went to bed and slept. I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t always seeing people and thinking as I am now. In the evening,\r\nthere in town, I go to the post office or to the depot to see the train\r\ncome in, and no one says anything to me. Everyone stands around and\r\nlaughs and they talk but they say nothing to me. Then I feel so queer\r\nthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk either. I go away. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fury of the young man became uncontrollable. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t stand it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nyelled, looking up at the bare branches of the trees. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not made to\r\nstand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaddened by the dull face of the man on the log by the fire, Elmer\r\nturned and glared at him as he had glared back along the road at the\r\ntown of Winesburg. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on back to work,\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good does\r\nit do me to talk to you?\xe2\x80\x9d A thought came to him and his voice dropped.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a coward too, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why I came clear out\r\nhere afoot? I had to tell someone and you were the only one I could\r\ntell. I hunted out another queer one, you see. I ran away, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI did. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to someone like that George Willard. I had\r\nto come to you. I ought to tell him and I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain his voice arose to a shout and his arms flew about. \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell\r\nhim. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be queer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what they think. I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElmer Cowley ran out of the woods leaving the half-wit sitting on the\r\nlog before the fire. Presently the old man arose and climbing over the\r\nfence went back to his work in the corn. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be washed and ironed and\r\nstarched,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be washed and ironed.\xe2\x80\x9d Mook\r\nwas interested. He went along a lane to a field where two cows stood\r\nnibbling at a straw stack. \xe2\x80\x9cElmer was here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the cows.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElmer is crazy. You better get behind the stack where he don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nyou. He\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt someone yet, Elmer will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening Elmer Cowley put his head in at the front\r\ndoor of the office of the _Winesburg Eagle_ where George Willard sat\r\nwriting. His cap was pulled down over his eyes and a sullen determined\r\nlook was on his face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come on outside with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stepping\r\nin and closing the door. He kept his hand on the knob as though\r\nprepared to resist anyone else coming in. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just come along outside.\r\nI want to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard and Elmer Cowley walked through the main street of\r\nWinesburg. The night was cold and George Willard had on a new overcoat\r\nand looked very spruce and dressed up. He thrust his hands into the\r\novercoat pockets and looked inquiringly at his companion. He had long\r\nbeen wanting to make friends with the young merchant and find out what\r\nwas in his mind. Now he thought he saw a chance and was delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder what he\xe2\x80\x99s up to? Perhaps he thinks he has a piece of news for\r\nthe paper. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be a fire because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the fire bell and\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone running,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nIn the main street of Winesburg, on the cold November evening, but few\r\ncitizens appeared and these hurried along bent on getting to the stove\r\nat the back of some store. The windows of the stores were frosted and\r\nthe wind rattled the tin sign that hung over the entrance to the\r\nstairway leading to Doctor Welling\xe2\x80\x99s office. Before Hern\xe2\x80\x99s Grocery a\r\nbasket of apples and a rack filled with new brooms stood on the\r\nsidewalk. Elmer Cowley stopped and stood facing George Willard. He\r\ntried to talk and his arms began to pump up and down. His face worked\r\nspasmodically. He seemed about to shout. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you go on back,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stay out here with me. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got anything to tell you.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor three hours the distracted young merchant wandered through the\r\nresident streets of Winesburg blind with anger, brought on by his\r\nfailure to declare his determination not to be queer. Bitterly the\r\nsense of defeat settled upon him and he wanted to weep. After the hours\r\nof futile sputtering at nothingness that had occupied the afternoon and\r\nhis failure in the presence of the young reporter, he thought he could\r\nsee no hope of a future for himself.\r\n\r\nAnd then a new idea dawned for him. In the darkness that surrounded him\r\nhe began to see a light. Going to the now darkened store, where Cowley\r\n& Son had for over a year waited vainly for trade to come, he crept\r\nstealthily in and felt about in a barrel that stood by the stove at the\r\nrear. In the barrel beneath shavings lay a tin box containing Cowley &\r\nSon\xe2\x80\x99s cash. Every evening Ebenezer Cowley put the box in the barrel\r\nwhen he closed the store and went upstairs to bed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t never\r\nthink of a careless place like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself, thinking of\r\nrobbers.\r\n\r\nElmer took twenty dollars, two ten-dollar bills, from the little roll\r\ncontaining perhaps four hundred dollars, the cash left from the sale of\r\nthe farm. Then replacing the box beneath the shavings he went quietly\r\nout at the front door and walked again in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe idea that he thought might put an end to all of his unhappiness was\r\nvery simple. \xe2\x80\x9cI will get out of here, run away from home,\xe2\x80\x9d he told\r\nhimself. He knew that a local freight train passed through Winesburg at\r\nmidnight and went on to Cleveland, where it arrived at dawn. He would\r\nsteal a ride on the local and when he got to Cleveland would lose\r\nhimself in the crowds there. He would get work in some shop and become\r\nfriends with the other workmen and would be indistinguishable. Then he\r\ncould talk and laugh. He would no longer be queer and would make\r\nfriends. Life would begin to have warmth and meaning for him as it had\r\nfor others.\r\n\r\nThe tall awkward young man, striding through the streets, laughed at\r\nhimself because he had been angry and had been half afraid of George\r\nWillard. He decided he would have his talk with the young reporter\r\nbefore he left town, that he would tell him about things, perhaps\r\nchallenge him, challenge all of Winesburg through him.\r\n\r\nAglow with new confidence Elmer went to the office of the New Willard\r\nHouse and pounded on the door. A sleep-eyed boy slept on a cot in the\r\noffice. He received no salary but was fed at the hotel table and bore\r\nwith pride the title of \xe2\x80\x9cnight clerk.\xe2\x80\x9d Before the boy Elmer was bold,\r\ninsistent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou \xe2\x80\x98wake him up,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell him to come down\r\nby the depot. I got to see him and I\xe2\x80\x99m going away on the local. Tell\r\nhim to dress and come on down. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got much time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe midnight local had finished its work in Winesburg and the trainsmen\r\nwere coupling cars, swinging lanterns and preparing to resume their\r\nflight east. George Willard, rubbing his eyes and again wearing the new\r\novercoat, ran down to the station platform afire with curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nhere I am. What do you want? You\xe2\x80\x99ve got something to tell me, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nElmer tried to explain. He wet his lips with his tongue and looked at\r\nthe train that had begun to groan and get under way. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe began, and then lost control of his tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be washed and\r\nironed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be washed and ironed and starched,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered half\r\nincoherently.\r\n\r\nElmer Cowley danced with fury beside the groaning train in the darkness\r\non the station platform. Lights leaped into the air and bobbed up and\r\ndown before his eyes. Taking the two ten-dollar bills from his pocket\r\nhe thrust them into George Willard\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cTake them,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want them. Give them to father. I stole them.\xe2\x80\x9d With a snarl of\r\nrage he turned and his long arms began to flay the air. Like one\r\nstruggling for release from hands that held him he struck out, hitting\r\nGeorge Willard blow after blow on the breast, the neck, the mouth. The\r\nyoung reporter rolled over on the platform half unconscious, stunned by\r\nthe terrific force of the blows. Springing aboard the passing train and\r\nrunning over the tops of cars, Elmer sprang down to a flat car and\r\nlying on his face looked back, trying to see the fallen man in the\r\ndarkness. Pride surged up in him. \xe2\x80\x9cI showed him,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I\r\nshowed him. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t so queer. I guess I showed him I ain\xe2\x80\x99t so queer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNTOLD LIE\r\n\r\n\r\nRay Pearson and Hal Winters were farm hands employed on a farm three\r\nmiles north of Winesburg. On Saturday afternoons they came into town\r\nand wandered about through the streets with other fellows from the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nRay was a quiet, rather nervous man of perhaps fifty with a brown beard\r\nand shoulders rounded by too much and too hard labor. In his nature he\r\nwas as unlike Hal Winters as two men can be unlike.\r\n\r\nRay was an altogether serious man and had a little sharp-featured wife\r\nwho had also a sharp voice. The two, with half a dozen thin-legged\r\nchildren, lived in a tumble-down frame house beside a creek at the back\r\nend of the Wills farm where Ray was employed.\r\n\r\nHal Winters, his fellow employee, was a young fellow. He was not of the\r\nNed Winters family, who were very respectable people in Winesburg, but\r\nwas one of the three sons of the old man called Windpeter Winters who\r\nhad a sawmill near Unionville, six miles away, and who was looked upon\r\nby everyone in Winesburg as a confirmed old reprobate.\r\n\r\nPeople from the part of Northern Ohio in which Winesburg lies will\r\nremember old Windpeter by his unusual and tragic death. He got drunk\r\none evening in town and started to drive home to Unionville along the\r\nrailroad tracks. Henry Brattenburg, the butcher, who lived out that\r\nway, stopped him at the edge of the town and told him he was sure to\r\nmeet the down train but Windpeter slashed at him with his whip and\r\ndrove on. When the train struck and killed him and his two horses a\r\nfarmer and his wife who were driving home along a nearby road saw the\r\naccident. They said that old Windpeter stood up on the seat of his\r\nwagon, raving and swearing at the onrushing locomotive, and that he\r\nfairly screamed with delight when the team, maddened by his incessant\r\nslashing at them, rushed straight ahead to certain death. Boys like\r\nyoung George Willard and Seth Richmond will remember the incident quite\r\nvividly because, although everyone in our town said that the old man\r\nwould go straight to hell and that the community was better off without\r\nhim, they had a secret conviction that he knew what he was doing and\r\nadmired his foolish courage. Most boys have seasons of wishing they\r\ncould die gloriously instead of just being grocery clerks and going on\r\nwith their humdrum lives.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the story of Windpeter Winters nor yet of his son Hal\r\nwho worked on the Wills farm with Ray Pearson. It is Ray\xe2\x80\x99s story. It\r\nwill, however, be necessary to talk a little of young Hal so that you\r\nwill get into the spirit of it.\r\n\r\nHal was a bad one. Everyone said that. There were three of the Winters\r\nboys in that family, John, Hal, and Edward, all broad-shouldered big\r\nfellows like old Windpeter himself and all fighters and woman-chasers\r\nand generally all-around bad ones.\r\n\r\nHal was the worst of the lot and always up to some devilment. He once\r\nstole a load of boards from his father\xe2\x80\x99s mill and sold them in\r\nWinesburg. With the money he bought himself a suit of cheap, flashy\r\nclothes. Then he got drunk and when his father came raving into town to\r\nfind him, they met and fought with their fists on Main Street and were\r\narrested and put into jail together.\r\n\r\nHal went to work on the Wills farm because there was a country school\r\nteacher out that way who had taken his fancy. He was only twenty-two\r\nthen but had already been in two or three of what were spoken of in\r\nWinesburg as \xe2\x80\x9cwomen scrapes.\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone who heard of his infatuation for\r\nthe school teacher was sure it would turn out badly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll only get\r\nher into trouble, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d was the word that went around.\r\n\r\nAnd so these two men, Ray and Hal, were at work in a field on a day in\r\nthe late October. They were husking corn and occasionally something was\r\nsaid and they laughed. Then came silence. Ray, who was the more\r\nsensitive and always minded things more, had chapped hands and they\r\nhurt. He put them into his coat pockets and looked away across the\r\nfields. He was in a sad, distracted mood and was affected by the beauty\r\nof the country. If you knew the Winesburg country in the fall and how\r\nthe low hills are all splashed with yellows and reds you would\r\nunderstand his feeling. He began to think of the time, long ago when he\r\nwas a young fellow living with his father, then a baker in Winesburg,\r\nand how on such days he had wandered away into the woods to gather\r\nnuts, hunt rabbits, or just to loaf about and smoke his pipe. His\r\nmarriage had come about through one of his days of wandering. He had\r\ninduced a girl who waited on trade in his father\xe2\x80\x99s shop to go with him\r\nand something had happened. He was thinking of that afternoon and how\r\nit had affected his whole life when a spirit of protest awoke in him.\r\nHe had forgotten about Hal and muttered words. \xe2\x80\x9cTricked by Gad, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I was, tricked by life and made a fool of,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nAs though understanding his thoughts, Hal Winters spoke up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, has\r\nit been worth while? What about it, eh? What about marriage and all\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked and then laughed. Hal tried to keep on laughing but he\r\ntoo was in an earnest mood. He began to talk earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cHas a fellow\r\ngot to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he got to be harnessed up and driven\r\nthrough life like a horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHal didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for an answer but sprang to his feet and began to walk\r\nback and forth between the corn shocks. He was getting more and more\r\nexcited. Bending down suddenly he picked up an ear of the yellow corn\r\nand threw it at the fence. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got Nell Gunther in trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, but you keep your mouth shut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRay Pearson arose and stood staring. He was almost a foot shorter than\r\nHal, and when the younger man came and put his two hands on the older\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders they made a picture. There they stood in the big empty\r\nfield with the quiet corn shocks standing in rows behind them and the\r\nred and yellow hills in the distance, and from being just two\r\nindifferent workmen they had become all alive to each other. Hal sensed\r\nit and because that was his way he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, old daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nawkwardly, \xe2\x80\x9ccome on, advise me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got Nell in trouble. Perhaps\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the same fix yourself. I know what everyone would say is\r\nthe right thing to do, but what do you say? Shall I marry and settle\r\ndown? Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old\r\nhorse? You know me, Ray. There can\xe2\x80\x99t anyone break me but I can break\r\nmyself. Shall I do it or shall I tell Nell to go to the devil? Come on,\r\nyou tell me. Whatever you say, Ray, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRay couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer. He shook Hal\xe2\x80\x99s hands loose and turning walked\r\nstraight away toward the barn. He was a sensitive man and there were\r\ntears in his eyes. He knew there was only one thing to say to Hal\r\nWinters, son of old Windpeter Winters, only one thing that all his own\r\ntraining and all the beliefs of the people he knew would approve, but\r\nfor his life he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say what he knew he should say.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four that afternoon Ray was puttering about the barnyard\r\nwhen his wife came up the lane along the creek and called him. After\r\nthe talk with Hal he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to the cornfield but worked about\r\nthe barn. He had already done the evening chores and had seen Hal,\r\ndressed and ready for a roistering night in town, come out of the\r\nfarmhouse and go into the road. Along the path to his own house he\r\ntrudged behind his wife, looking at the ground and thinking. He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out what was wrong. Every time he raised his eyes and saw\r\nthe beauty of the country in the failing light he wanted to do\r\nsomething he had never done before, shout or scream or hit his wife\r\nwith his fists or something equally unexpected and terrifying. Along\r\nthe path he went scratching his head and trying to make it out. He\r\nlooked hard at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s back but she seemed all right.\r\n\r\nShe only wanted him to go into town for groceries and as soon as she\r\nhad told him what she wanted began to scold. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always puttering,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I want you to hustle. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything in the house\r\nfor supper and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get to town and back in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRay went into his own house and took an overcoat from a hook back of\r\nthe door. It was torn about the pockets and the collar was shiny. His\r\nwife went into the bedroom and presently came out with a soiled cloth\r\nin one hand and three silver dollars in the other. Somewhere in the\r\nhouse a child wept bitterly and a dog that had been sleeping by the\r\nstove arose and yawned. Again the wife scolded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe children will cry\r\nand cry. Why are you always puttering?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nRay went out of the house and climbed the fence into a field. It was\r\njust growing dark and the scene that lay before him was lovely. All the\r\nlow hills were washed with color and even the little clusters of bushes\r\nin the corners of the fences were alive with beauty. The whole world\r\nseemed to Ray Pearson to have become alive with something just as he\r\nand Hal had suddenly become alive when they stood in the corn field\r\nstaring into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the country about Winesburg was too much for Ray on that\r\nfall evening. That is all there was to it. He could not stand it. Of a\r\nsudden he forgot all about being a quiet old farm hand and throwing off\r\nthe torn overcoat began to run across the field. As he ran he shouted a\r\nprotest against his life, against all life, against everything that\r\nmakes life ugly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no promise made,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried into the empty\r\nspaces that lay about him. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t promise my Minnie anything and Hal\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t made any promise to Nell. I know he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. She went into the\r\nwoods with him because she wanted to go. What he wanted she wanted. Why\r\nshould I pay? Why should Hal pay? Why should anyone pay? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nHal to become old and worn out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him. I won\xe2\x80\x99t let it go on.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll catch Hal before he gets to town and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRay ran clumsily and once he stumbled and fell down. \xe2\x80\x9cI must catch Hal\r\nand tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept thinking, and although his breath came in gasps\r\nhe kept running harder and harder. As he ran he thought of things that\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t come into his mind for years\xe2\x80\x94how at the time he married he had\r\nplanned to go west to his uncle in Portland, Oregon\xe2\x80\x94how he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwanted to be a farm hand, but had thought when he got out West he would\r\ngo to sea and be a sailor or get a job on a ranch and ride a horse into\r\nWestern towns, shouting and laughing and waking the people in the\r\nhouses with his wild cries. Then as he ran he remembered his children\r\nand in fancy felt their hands clutching at him. All of his thoughts of\r\nhimself were involved with the thoughts of Hal and he thought the\r\nchildren were clutching at the younger man also. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are the\r\naccidents of life, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not mine or yours. I had\r\nnothing to do with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDarkness began to spread over the fields as Ray Pearson ran on and on.\r\nHis breath came in little sobs. When he came to the fence at the edge\r\nof the road and confronted Hal Winters, all dressed up and smoking a\r\npipe as he walked jauntily along, he could not have told what he\r\nthought or what he wanted.\r\n\r\nRay Pearson lost his nerve and this is really the end of the story of\r\nwhat happened to him. It was almost dark when he got to the fence and\r\nhe put his hands on the top bar and stood staring. Hal Winters jumped a\r\nditch and coming up close to Ray put his hands into his pockets and\r\nlaughed. He seemed to have lost his own sense of what had happened in\r\nthe corn field and when he put up a strong hand and took hold of the\r\nlapel of Ray\xe2\x80\x99s coat he shook the old man as he might have shaken a dog\r\nthat had misbehaved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came to tell me, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind telling me\r\nanything. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a coward and I\xe2\x80\x99ve already made up my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlaughed again and jumped back across the ditch. \xe2\x80\x9cNell ain\xe2\x80\x99t no fool,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to marry her. I want to marry her. I want\r\nto settle down and have kids.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRay Pearson also laughed. He felt like laughing at himself and all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs the form of Hal Winters disappeared in the dusk that lay over the\r\nroad that led to Winesburg, he turned and walked slowly back across the\r\nfields to where he had left his torn overcoat. As he went some memory\r\nof pleasant evenings spent with the thin-legged children in the\r\ntumble-down house by the creek must have come into his mind, for he\r\nmuttered words. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just as well. Whatever I told him would have been\r\na lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly, and then his form also disappeared into the\r\ndarkness of the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRINK\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Foster came to Winesburg from Cincinnati when he was still young\r\nand could get many new impressions. His grandmother had been raised on\r\na farm near the town and as a young girl had gone to school there when\r\nWinesburg was a village of twelve or fifteen houses clustered about a\r\ngeneral store on the Trunion Pike.\r\n\r\nWhat a life the old woman had led since she went away from the frontier\r\nsettlement and what a strong, capable little old thing she was! She had\r\nbeen in Kansas, in Canada, and in New York City, traveling about with\r\nher husband, a mechanic, before he died. Later she went to stay with\r\nher daughter, who had also married a mechanic and lived in Covington,\r\nKentucky, across the river from Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nThen began the hard years for Tom Foster\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother. First her\r\nson-in-law was killed by a policeman during a strike and then Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother became an invalid and died also. The grandmother had saved a\r\nlittle money, but it was swept away by the illness of the daughter and\r\nby the cost of the two funerals. She became a half worn-out old woman\r\nworker and lived with the grandson above a junk shop on a side street\r\nin Cincinnati. For five years she scrubbed the floors in an office\r\nbuilding and then got a place as dish washer in a restaurant. Her hands\r\nwere all twisted out of shape. When she took hold of a mop or a broom\r\nhandle the hands looked like the dried stems of an old creeping vine\r\nclinging to a tree.\r\n\r\nThe old woman came back to Winesburg as soon as she got the chance. One\r\nevening as she was coming home from work she found a pocket-book\r\ncontaining thirty-seven dollars, and that opened the way. The trip was\r\na great adventure for the boy. It was past seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night when\r\nthe grandmother came home with the pocket-book held tightly in her old\r\nhands and she was so excited she could scarcely speak. She insisted on\r\nleaving Cincinnati that night, saying that if they stayed until morning\r\nthe owner of the money would be sure to find them out and make trouble.\r\nTom, who was then sixteen years old, had to go trudging off to the\r\nstation with the old woman, bearing all of their earthly belongings\r\ndone up in a worn-out blanket and slung across his back. By his side\r\nwalked the grandmother urging him forward. Her toothless old mouth\r\ntwitched nervously, and when Tom grew weary and wanted to put the pack\r\ndown at a street crossing, she snatched it up and if he had not\r\nprevented would have slung it across her own back. When they got into\r\nthe train and it had run out of the city she was as delighted as a girl\r\nand talked as the boy had never heard her talk before.\r\n\r\nAll through the night as the train rattled along, the grandmother told\r\nTom tales of Winesburg and of how he would enjoy his life working in\r\nthe fields and shooting wild things in the woods there. She could not\r\nbelieve that the tiny village of fifty years before had grown into a\r\nthriving town in her absence, and in the morning when the train came to\r\nWinesburg did not want to get off. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t what I thought. It may be\r\nhard for you here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then the train went on its way and\r\nthe two stood confused, not knowing where to turn, in the presence of\r\nAlbert Longworth, the Winesburg baggage master.\r\n\r\nBut Tom Foster did get along all right. He was one to get along\r\nanywhere. Mrs. White, the banker\xe2\x80\x99s wife, employed his grandmother to\r\nwork in the kitchen and he got a place as stable boy in the banker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnew brick barn.\r\n\r\nIn Winesburg servants were hard to get. The woman who wanted help in\r\nher housework employed a \xe2\x80\x9chired girl\xe2\x80\x9d who insisted on sitting at the\r\ntable with the family. Mrs. White was sick of hired girls and snatched\r\nat the chance to get hold of the old city woman. She furnished a room\r\nfor the boy Tom upstairs in the barn. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can mow the lawn and run\r\nerrands when the horses do not need attention,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nTom Foster was rather small for his age and had a large head covered\r\nwith stiff black hair that stood straight up. The hair emphasized the\r\nbigness of his head. His voice was the softest thing imaginable, and he\r\nwas himself so gentle and quiet that he slipped into the life of the\r\ntown without attracting the least bit of attention.\r\n\r\nOne could not help wondering where Tom Foster got his gentleness. In\r\nCincinnati he had lived in a neighborhood where gangs of tough boys\r\nprowled through the streets, and all through his early formative years\r\nhe ran about with tough boys. For a while he was a messenger for a\r\ntelegraph company and delivered messages in a neighborhood sprinkled\r\nwith houses of prostitution. The women in the houses knew and loved Tom\r\nFoster and the tough boys in the gangs loved him also.\r\n\r\nHe never asserted himself. That was one thing that helped him escape.\r\nIn an odd way he stood in the shadow of the wall of life, was meant to\r\nstand in the shadow. He saw the men and women in the houses of lust,\r\nsensed their casual and horrible love affairs, saw boys fighting and\r\nlistened to their tales of thieving and drunkenness, unmoved and\r\nstrangely unaffected.\r\n\r\nOnce Tom did steal. That was while he still lived in the city. The\r\ngrandmother was ill at the time and he himself was out of work. There\r\nwas nothing to eat in the house, and so he went into a harness shop on\r\na side street and stole a dollar and seventy-five cents out of the cash\r\ndrawer.\r\n\r\nThe harness shop was run by an old man with a long mustache. He saw the\r\nboy lurking about and thought nothing of it. When he went out into the\r\nstreet to talk to a teamster Tom opened the cash drawer and taking the\r\nmoney walked away. Later he was caught and his grandmother settled the\r\nmatter by offering to come twice a week for a month and scrub the shop.\r\nThe boy was ashamed, but he was rather glad, too. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all right to\r\nbe ashamed and makes me understand new things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the\r\ngrandmother, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the boy was talking about but loved\r\nhim so much that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether she understood or not.\r\n\r\nFor a year Tom Foster lived in the banker\xe2\x80\x99s stable and then lost his\r\nplace there. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t take very good care of the horses and he was a\r\nconstant source of irritation to the banker\xe2\x80\x99s wife. She told him to mow\r\nthe lawn and he forgot. Then she sent him to the store or to the post\r\noffice and he did not come back but joined a group of men and boys and\r\nspent the whole afternoon with them, standing about, listening and\r\noccasionally, when addressed, saying a few words. As in the city in the\r\nhouses of prostitution and with the rowdy boys running through the\r\nstreets at night, so in Winesburg among its citizens he had always the\r\npower to be a part of and yet distinctly apart from the life about him.\r\n\r\nAfter Tom lost his place at Banker White\xe2\x80\x99s he did not live with his\r\ngrandmother, although often in the evening she came to visit him. He\r\nrented a room at the rear of a little frame building belonging to old\r\nRufus Whiting. The building was on Duane Street, just off Main Street,\r\nand had been used for years as a law office by the old man, who had\r\nbecome too feeble and forgetful for the practice of his profession but\r\ndid not realize his inefficiency. He liked Tom and let him have the\r\nroom for a dollar a month. In the late afternoon when the lawyer had\r\ngone home the boy had the place to himself and spent hours lying on the\r\nfloor by the stove and thinking of things. In the evening the\r\ngrandmother came and sat in the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s chair to smoke a pipe while\r\nTom remained silent, as he always did in the presence of everyone.\r\n\r\nOften the old woman talked with great vigor. Sometimes she was angry\r\nabout some happening at the banker\xe2\x80\x99s house and scolded away for hours.\r\nOut of her own earnings she bought a mop and regularly scrubbed the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office. Then when the place was spotlessly clean and smelled\r\nclean she lighted her clay pipe and she and Tom had a smoke together.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you get ready to die then I will die also,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the boy\r\nlying on the floor beside her chair.\r\n\r\nTom Foster enjoyed life in Winesburg. He did odd jobs, such as cutting\r\nwood for kitchen stoves and mowing the grass before houses. In late May\r\nand early June he picked strawberries in the fields. He had time to\r\nloaf and he enjoyed loafing. Banker White had given him a cast-off coat\r\nwhich was too large for him, but his grandmother cut it down, and he\r\nhad also an overcoat, got at the same place, that was lined with fur.\r\nThe fur was worn away in spots, but the coat was warm and in the winter\r\nTom slept in it. He thought his method of getting along good enough and\r\nwas happy and satisfied with the way life in Winesburg had turned out\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nThe most absurd little things made Tom Foster happy. That, I suppose,\r\nwas why people loved him. In Hern\xe2\x80\x99s Grocery they would be roasting\r\ncoffee on Friday afternoon, preparatory to the Saturday rush of trade,\r\nand the rich odor invaded lower Main Street. Tom Foster appeared and\r\nsat on a box at the rear of the store. For an hour he did not move but\r\nsat perfectly still, filling his being with the spicy odor that made\r\nhim half drunk with happiness. \xe2\x80\x9cI like it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes\r\nme think of things far away, places and things like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne night Tom Foster got drunk. That came about in a curious way. He\r\nnever had been drunk before, and indeed in all his life had never taken\r\na drink of anything intoxicating, but he felt he needed to be drunk\r\nthat one time and so went and did it.\r\n\r\nIn Cincinnati, when he lived there, Tom had found out many things,\r\nthings about ugliness and crime and lust. Indeed, he knew more of these\r\nthings than anyone else in Winesburg. The matter of sex in particular\r\nhad presented itself to him in a quite horrible way and had made a deep\r\nimpression on his mind. He thought, after what he had seen of the women\r\nstanding before the squalid houses on cold nights and the look he had\r\nseen in the eyes of the men who stopped to talk to them, that he would\r\nput sex altogether out of his own life. One of the women of the\r\nneighborhood tempted him once and he went into a room with her. He\r\nnever forgot the smell of the room nor the greedy look that came into\r\nthe eyes of the woman. It sickened him and in a very terrible way left\r\na scar on his soul. He had always before thought of women as quite\r\ninnocent things, much like his grandmother, but after that one\r\nexperience in the room he dismissed women from his mind. So gentle was\r\nhis nature that he could not hate anything and not being able to\r\nunderstand he decided to forget.\r\n\r\nAnd Tom did forget until he came to Winesburg. After he had lived there\r\nfor two years something began to stir in him. On all sides he saw youth\r\nmaking love and he was himself a youth. Before he knew what had\r\nhappened he was in love also. He fell in love with Helen White,\r\ndaughter of the man for whom he had worked, and found himself thinking\r\nof her at night.\r\n\r\nThat was a problem for Tom and he settled it in his own way. He let\r\nhimself think of Helen White whenever her figure came into his mind and\r\nonly concerned himself with the manner of his thoughts. He had a fight,\r\na quiet determined little fight of his own, to keep his desires in the\r\nchannel where he thought they belonged, but on the whole he was\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the spring night when he got drunk. Tom was wild on that\r\nnight. He was like an innocent young buck of the forest that has eaten\r\nof some maddening weed. The thing began, ran its course, and was ended\r\nin one night, and you may be sure that no one in Winesburg was any the\r\nworse for Tom\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the night was one to make a sensitive nature drunk.\r\nThe trees along the residence streets of the town were all newly\r\nclothed in soft green leaves, in the gardens behind the houses men were\r\nputtering about in vegetable gardens, and in the air there was a hush,\r\na waiting kind of silence very stirring to the blood.\r\n\r\nTom left his room on Duane Street just as the young night began to make\r\nitself felt. First he walked through the streets, going softly and\r\nquietly along, thinking thoughts that he tried to put into words. He\r\nsaid that Helen White was a flame dancing in the air and that he was a\r\nlittle tree without leaves standing out sharply against the sky. Then\r\nhe said that she was a wind, a strong terrible wind, coming out of the\r\ndarkness of a stormy sea and that he was a boat left on the shore of\r\nthe sea by a fisherman.\r\n\r\nThat idea pleased the boy and he sauntered along playing with it. He\r\nwent into Main Street and sat on the curbing before Wacker\xe2\x80\x99s tobacco\r\nstore. For an hour he lingered about listening to the talk of men, but\r\nit did not interest him much and he slipped away. Then he decided to\r\nget drunk and went into Willy\xe2\x80\x99s saloon and bought a bottle of whiskey.\r\nPutting the bottle into his pocket, he walked out of town, wanting to\r\nbe alone to think more thoughts and to drink the whiskey.\r\n\r\nTom got drunk sitting on a bank of new grass beside the road about a\r\nmile north of town. Before him was a white road and at his back an\r\napple orchard in full bloom. He took a drink out of the bottle and then\r\nlay down on the grass. He thought of mornings in Winesburg and of how\r\nthe stones in the graveled driveway by Banker White\xe2\x80\x99s house were wet\r\nwith dew and glistened in the morning light. He thought of the nights\r\nin the barn when it rained and he lay awake hearing the drumming of the\r\nraindrops and smelling the warm smell of horses and of hay. Then he\r\nthought of a storm that had gone roaring through Winesburg several days\r\nbefore and, his mind going back, he relived the night he had spent on\r\nthe train with his grandmother when the two were coming from\r\nCincinnati. Sharply he remembered how strange it had seemed to sit\r\nquietly in the coach and to feel the power of the engine hurling the\r\ntrain along through the night.\r\n\r\nTom got drunk in a very short time. He kept taking drinks from the\r\nbottle as the thoughts visited him and when his head began to reel got\r\nup and walked along the road going away from Winesburg. There was a\r\nbridge on the road that ran out of Winesburg north to Lake Erie and the\r\ndrunken boy made his way along the road to the bridge. There he sat\r\ndown. He tried to drink again, but when he had taken the cork out of\r\nthe bottle he became ill and put it quickly back. His head was rocking\r\nback and forth and so he sat on the stone approach to the bridge and\r\nsighed. His head seemed to be flying about like a pinwheel and then\r\nprojecting itself off into space and his arms and legs flopped\r\nhelplessly about.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Tom got back into town. George Willard found him\r\nwandering about and took him into the _Eagle_ printshop. Then he became\r\nafraid that the drunken boy would make a mess on the floor and helped\r\nhim into the alleyway.\r\n\r\nThe reporter was confused by Tom Foster. The drunken boy talked of\r\nHelen White and said he had been with her on the shore of a sea and had\r\nmade love to her. George had seen Helen White walking in the street\r\nwith her father during the evening and decided that Tom was out of his\r\nhead. A sentiment concerning Helen White that lurked in his own heart\r\nflamed up and he became angry. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you quit that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet Helen White\xe2\x80\x99s name be dragged into this. I won\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe began shaking Tom\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, trying to make him understand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nquit it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said again.\r\n\r\nFor three hours the two young men, thus strangely thrown together,\r\nstayed in the printshop. When he had a little recovered George took Tom\r\nfor a walk. They went into the country and sat on a log near the edge\r\nof a wood. Something in the still night drew them together and when the\r\ndrunken boy\xe2\x80\x99s head began to clear they talked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was good to be drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Foster said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt taught me something. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have to do it again. I will think more dearly after this. You see\r\nhow it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard did not see, but his anger concerning Helen White passed\r\nand he felt drawn toward the pale, shaken boy as he had never before\r\nbeen drawn toward anyone. With motherly solicitude, he insisted that\r\nTom get to his feet and walk about. Again they went back to the\r\nprintshop and sat in silence in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe reporter could not get the purpose of Tom Foster\xe2\x80\x99s action\r\nstraightened out in his mind. When Tom spoke again of Helen White he\r\nagain grew angry and began to scold. \xe2\x80\x9cYou quit that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been with her. What makes you say you have? What makes you\r\nkeep saying such things? Now you quit it, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was hurt. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel with George Willard because he was\r\nincapable of quarreling, so he got up to go away. When George Willard\r\nwas insistent he put out his hand, laying it on the older boy\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\r\nand tried to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it was. I was happy. You see\r\nhow that was. Helen White made me happy and the night did too. I wanted\r\nto suffer, to be hurt somehow. I thought that was what I should do. I\r\nwanted to suffer, you see, because everyone suffers and does wrong. I\r\nthought of a lot of things to do, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work. They all hurt\r\nsomeone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom Foster\xe2\x80\x99s voice arose, and for once in his life he became almost\r\nexcited. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like making love, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see how it is? It hurt me to do what I did and made\r\neverything strange. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I did it. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad, too. It taught me\r\nsomething, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand? I\r\nwanted to learn things, you see. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stairway leading up to Doctor Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s office, in the Heffner Block\r\nabove the Paris Dry Goods store, was but dimly lighted. At the head of\r\nthe stairway hung a lamp with a dirty chimney that was fastened by a\r\nbracket to the wall. The lamp had a tin reflector, brown with rust and\r\ncovered with dust. The people who went up the stairway followed with\r\ntheir feet the feet of many who had gone before. The soft boards of the\r\nstairs had yielded under the pressure of feet and deep hollows marked\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairway a turn to the right brought you to the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s door. To the left was a dark hallway filled with rubbish. Old\r\nchairs, carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s horses, step ladders and empty boxes lay in the\r\ndarkness waiting for shins to be barked. The pile of rubbish belonged\r\nto the Paris Dry Goods Company. When a counter or a row of shelves in\r\nthe store became useless, clerks carried it up the stairway and threw\r\nit on the pile.\r\n\r\nDoctor Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s office was as large as a barn. A stove with a round\r\npaunch sat in the middle of the room. Around its base was piled\r\nsawdust, held in place by heavy planks nailed to the floor. By the door\r\nstood a huge table that had once been a part of the furniture of\r\nHerrick\xe2\x80\x99s Clothing Store and that had been used for displaying\r\ncustom-made clothes. It was covered with books, bottles, and surgical\r\ninstruments. Near the edge of the table lay three or four apples left\r\nby John Spaniard, a tree nurseryman who was Doctor Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s friend, and\r\nwho had slipped the apples out of his pocket as he came in at the door.\r\n\r\nAt middle age Doctor Reefy was tall and awkward. The grey beard he\r\nlater wore had not yet appeared, but on the upper lip grew a brown\r\nmustache. He was not a graceful man, as when he grew older, and was\r\nmuch occupied with the problem of disposing of his hands and feet.\r\n\r\nOn summer afternoons, when she had been married many years and when her\r\nson George was a boy of twelve or fourteen, Elizabeth Willard sometimes\r\nwent up the worn steps to Doctor Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s office. Already the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnaturally tall figure had begun to droop and to drag itself listlessly\r\nabout. Ostensibly she went to see the doctor because of her health, but\r\non the half dozen occasions when she had been to see him the outcome of\r\nthe visits did not primarily concern her health. She and the doctor\r\ntalked of that but they talked most of her life, of their two lives and\r\nof the ideas that had come to them as they lived their lives in\r\nWinesburg.\r\n\r\nIn the big empty office the man and the woman sat looking at each other\r\nand they were a good deal alike. Their bodies were different, as were\r\nalso the color of their eyes, the length of their noses, and the\r\ncircumstances of their existence, but something inside them meant the\r\nsame thing, wanted the same release, would have left the same\r\nimpression on the memory of an onlooker. Later, and when he grew older\r\nand married a young wife, the doctor often talked to her of the hours\r\nspent with the sick woman and expressed a good many things he had been\r\nunable to express to Elizabeth. He was almost a poet in his old age and\r\nhis notion of what happened took a poetic turn. \xe2\x80\x9cI had come to the time\r\nin my life when prayer became necessary and so I invented gods and\r\nprayed to them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not say my prayers in words nor did I\r\nkneel down but sat perfectly still in my chair. In the late afternoon\r\nwhen it was hot and quiet on Main Street or in the winter when the days\r\nwere gloomy, the gods came into the office and I thought no one knew\r\nabout them. Then I found that this woman Elizabeth knew, that she\r\nworshipped also the same gods. I have a notion that she came to the\r\noffice because she thought the gods would be there but she was happy to\r\nfind herself not alone just the same. It was an experience that cannot\r\nbe explained, although I suppose it is always happening to men and\r\nwomen in all sorts of places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the summer afternoons when Elizabeth and the doctor sat in the\r\noffice and talked of their two lives they talked of other lives also.\r\nSometimes the doctor made philosophic epigrams. Then he chuckled with\r\namusement. Now and then after a period of silence, a word was said or a\r\nhint given that strangely illuminated the life of the speaker, a wish\r\nbecame a desire, or a dream, half dead, flared suddenly into life. For\r\nthe most part the words came from the woman and she said them without\r\nlooking at the man.\r\n\r\nEach time she came to see the doctor the hotel keeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife talked a\r\nlittle more freely and after an hour or two in his presence went down\r\nthe stairway into Main Street feeling renewed and strengthened against\r\nthe dullness of her days. With something approaching a girlhood swing\r\nto her body she walked along, but when she had got back to her chair by\r\nthe window of her room and when darkness had come on and a girl from\r\nthe hotel dining room brought her dinner on a tray, she let it grow\r\ncold. Her thoughts ran away to her girlhood with its passionate longing\r\nfor adventure and she remembered the arms of men that had held her when\r\nadventure was a possible thing for her. Particularly she remembered one\r\nwho had for a time been her lover and who in the moment of his passion\r\nhad cried out to her more than a hundred times, saying the same words\r\nmadly over and over: \xe2\x80\x9cYou dear! You dear! You lovely dear!\xe2\x80\x9d The words,\r\nshe thought, expressed something she would have liked to have achieved\r\nin life.\r\n\r\nIn her room in the shabby old hotel the sick wife of the hotel keeper\r\nbegan to weep and, putting her hands to her face, rocked back and\r\nforth. The words of her one friend, Doctor Reefy, rang in her ears.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove is like a wind stirring the grass beneath trees on a black\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not try to make love definite. It is the\r\ndivine accident of life. If you try to be definite and sure about it\r\nand to live beneath the trees, where soft night winds blow, the long\r\nhot day of disappointment comes swiftly and the gritty dust from\r\npassing wagons gathers upon lips inflamed and made tender by kisses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth Willard could not remember her mother who had died when she\r\nwas but five years old. Her girlhood had been lived in the most\r\nhaphazard manner imaginable. Her father was a man who had wanted to be\r\nlet alone and the affairs of the hotel would not let him alone. He also\r\nhad lived and died a sick man. Every day he arose with a cheerful face,\r\nbut by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning all the joy had gone out of his\r\nheart. When a guest complained of the fare in the hotel dining room or\r\none of the girls who made up the beds got married and went away, he\r\nstamped on the floor and swore. At night when he went to bed he thought\r\nof his daughter growing up among the stream of people that drifted in\r\nand out of the hotel and was overcome with sadness. As the girl grew\r\nolder and began to walk out in the evening with men he wanted to talk\r\nto her, but when he tried was not successful. He always forgot what he\r\nwanted to say and spent the time complaining of his own affairs.\r\n\r\nIn her girlhood and young womanhood Elizabeth had tried to be a real\r\nadventurer in life. At eighteen life had so gripped her that she was no\r\nlonger a virgin but, although she had a half dozen lovers before she\r\nmarried Tom Willard, she had never entered upon an adventure prompted\r\nby desire alone. Like all the women in the world, she wanted a real\r\nlover. Always there was something she sought blindly, passionately,\r\nsome hidden wonder in life. The tall beautiful girl with the swinging\r\nstride who had walked under the trees with men was forever putting out\r\nher hand into the darkness and trying to get hold of some other hand.\r\nIn all the babble of words that fell from the lips of the men with whom\r\nshe adventured she was trying to find what would be for her the true\r\nword.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had married Tom Willard, a clerk in her father\xe2\x80\x99s hotel,\r\nbecause he was at hand and wanted to marry at the time when the\r\ndetermination to marry came to her. For a while, like most young girls,\r\nshe thought marriage would change the face of life. If there was in her\r\nmind a doubt of the outcome of the marriage with Tom she brushed it\r\naside. Her father was ill and near death at the time and she was\r\nperplexed because of the meaningless outcome of an affair in which she\r\nhad just been involved. Other girls of her age in Winesburg were\r\nmarrying men she had always known, grocery clerks or young farmers. In\r\nthe evening they walked in Main Street with their husbands and when she\r\npassed they smiled happily. She began to think that the fact of\r\nmarriage might be full of some hidden significance. Young wives with\r\nwhom she talked spoke softly and shyly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt changes things to have a\r\nman of your own,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before her marriage the perplexed girl had a talk with\r\nher father. Later she wondered if the hours alone with the sick man had\r\nnot led to her decision to marry. The father talked of his life and\r\nadvised the daughter to avoid being led into another such muddle. He\r\nabused Tom Willard, and that led Elizabeth to come to the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndefense. The sick man became excited and tried to get out of bed. When\r\nshe would not let him walk about he began to complain. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been\r\nlet alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard I\xe2\x80\x99ve not made the hotel\r\npay. Even now I owe money at the bank. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find that out when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice of the sick man became tense with earnestness. Being unable\r\nto arise, he put out his hand and pulled the girl\xe2\x80\x99s head down beside\r\nhis own. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a way out,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t marry Tom Willard or\r\nanyone else here in Winesburg. There is eight hundred dollars in a tin\r\nbox in my trunk. Take it and go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s voice became querulous. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to promise,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe declared. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t promise not to marry, give me your word that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll never tell Tom about the money. It is mine and if I give it to\r\nyou I\xe2\x80\x99ve the right to make that demand. Hide it away. It is to make up\r\nto you for my failure as a father. Some time it may prove to be a door,\r\na great open door to you. Come now, I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m about to die, give\r\nme your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Doctor Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s office, Elizabeth, a tired gaunt old woman at\r\nforty-one, sat in a chair near the stove and looked at the floor. By a\r\nsmall desk near the window sat the doctor. His hands played with a lead\r\npencil that lay on the desk. Elizabeth talked of her life as a married\r\nwoman. She became impersonal and forgot her husband, only using him as\r\na lay figure to give point to her tale. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I was married and it\r\ndid not turn out at all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I had gone\r\ninto it I began to be afraid. Perhaps I knew too much before and then\r\nperhaps I found out too much during my first night with him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I was. When father gave me the money and tried to talk me\r\nout of the thought of marriage, I would not listen. I thought of what\r\nthe girls who were married had said of it and I wanted marriage also.\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Tom I wanted, it was marriage. When father went to sleep I\r\nleaned out of the window and thought of the life I had led. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be a bad woman. The town was full of stories about me. I even\r\nbegan to be afraid Tom would change his mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice began to quiver with excitement. To Doctor Reefy, who\r\nwithout realizing what was happening had begun to love her, there came\r\nan odd illusion. He thought that as she talked the woman\xe2\x80\x99s body was\r\nchanging, that she was becoming younger, straighter, stronger. When he\r\ncould not shake off the illusion his mind gave it a professional twist.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good for both her body and her mind, this talking,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nThe woman began telling of an incident that had happened one afternoon\r\na few months after her marriage. Her voice became steadier. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nlate afternoon I went for a drive alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a buggy and\r\na little grey pony I kept in Moyer\xe2\x80\x99s Livery. Tom was painting and\r\nrepapering rooms in the hotel. He wanted money and I was trying to make\r\nup my mind to tell him about the eight hundred dollars father had given\r\nto me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide to do it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him well enough. There\r\nwas always paint on his hands and face during those days and he smelled\r\nof paint. He was trying to fix up the old hotel, and make it new and\r\nsmart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe excited woman sat up very straight in her chair and made a quick\r\ngirlish movement with her hand as she told of the drive alone on the\r\nspring afternoon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was cloudy and a storm threatened,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack clouds made the green of the trees and the grass stand out so\r\nthat the colors hurt my eyes. I went out Trunion Pike a mile or more\r\nand then turned into a side road. The little horse went quickly along\r\nup hill and down. I was impatient. Thoughts came and I wanted to get\r\naway from my thoughts. I began to beat the horse. The black clouds\r\nsettled down and it began to rain. I wanted to go at a terrible speed,\r\nto drive on and on forever. I wanted to get out of town, out of my\r\nclothes, out of my marriage, out of my body, out of everything. I\r\nalmost killed the horse, making him run, and when he could not run any\r\nmore I got out of the buggy and ran afoot into the darkness until I\r\nfell and hurt my side. I wanted to run away from everything but I\r\nwanted to run towards something too. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, dear, how it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth sprang out of the chair and began to walk about in the\r\noffice. She walked as Doctor Reefy thought he had never seen anyone\r\nwalk before. To her whole body there was a swing, a rhythm that\r\nintoxicated him. When she came and knelt on the floor beside his chair\r\nhe took her into his arms and began to kiss her passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI cried\r\nall the way home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she tried to continue the story of her\r\nwild ride, but he did not listen. \xe2\x80\x9cYou dear! You lovely dear! Oh you\r\nlovely dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered and thought he held in his arms not the\r\ntired-out woman of forty-one but a lovely and innocent girl who had\r\nbeen able by some miracle to project herself out of the husk of the\r\nbody of the tired-out woman.\r\n\r\nDoctor Reefy did not see the woman he had held in his arms again until\r\nafter her death. On the summer afternoon in the office when he was on\r\nthe point of becoming her lover a half grotesque little incident\r\nbrought his love-making quickly to an end. As the man and woman held\r\neach other tightly heavy feet came tramping up the office stairs. The\r\ntwo sprang to their feet and stood listening and trembling. The noise\r\non the stairs was made by a clerk from the Paris Dry Goods Company.\r\nWith a loud bang he threw an empty box on the pile of rubbish in the\r\nhallway and then went heavily down the stairs. Elizabeth followed him\r\nalmost immediately. The thing that had come to life in her as she\r\ntalked to her one friend died suddenly. She was hysterical, as was also\r\nDoctor Reefy, and did not want to continue the talk. Along the street\r\nshe went with the blood still singing in her body, but when she turned\r\nout of Main Street and saw ahead the lights of the New Willard House,\r\nshe began to tremble and her knees shook so that for a moment she\r\nthought she would fall in the street.\r\n\r\nThe sick woman spent the last few months of her life hungering for\r\ndeath. Along the road of death she went, seeking, hungering. She\r\npersonified the figure of death and made him now a strong black-haired\r\nyouth running over hills, now a stern quiet man marked and scarred by\r\nthe business of living. In the darkness of her room she put out her\r\nhand, thrusting it from under the covers of her bed, and she thought\r\nthat death like a living thing put out his hand to her. \xe2\x80\x9cBe patient,\r\nlover,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep yourself young and beautiful and be\r\npatient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the evening when disease laid its heavy hand upon her and defeated\r\nher plans for telling her son George of the eight hundred dollars\r\nhidden away, she got out of bed and crept half across the room pleading\r\nwith death for another hour of life. \xe2\x80\x9cWait, dear! The boy! The boy! The\r\nboy!\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded as she tried with all of her strength to fight off\r\nthe arms of the lover she had wanted so earnestly.\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth died one day in March in the year when her son George became\r\neighteen, and the young man had but little sense of the meaning of her\r\ndeath. Only time could give him that. For a month he had seen her lying\r\nwhite and still and speechless in her bed, and then one afternoon the\r\ndoctor stopped him in the hallway and said a few words.\r\n\r\nThe young man went into his own room and closed the door. He had a\r\nqueer empty feeling in the region of his stomach. For a moment he sat\r\nstaring at the floor and then jumping up went for a walk. Along the\r\nstation platform he went, and around through residence streets past the\r\nhigh-school building, thinking almost entirely of his own affairs. The\r\nnotion of death could not get hold of him and he was in fact a little\r\nannoyed that his mother had died on that day. He had just received a\r\nnote from Helen White, the daughter of the town banker, in answer to\r\none from him. \xe2\x80\x9cTonight I could have gone to see her and now it will\r\nhave to be put off,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought half angrily.\r\n\r\nElizabeth died on a Friday afternoon at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It had been cold\r\nand rainy in the morning but in the afternoon the sun came out. Before\r\nshe died she lay paralyzed for six days unable to speak or move and\r\nwith only her mind and her eyes alive. For three of the six days she\r\nstruggled, thinking of her boy, trying to say some few words in regard\r\nto his future, and in her eyes there was an appeal so touching that all\r\nwho saw it kept the memory of the dying woman in their minds for years.\r\nEven Tom Willard, who had always half resented his wife, forgot his\r\nresentment and the tears ran out of his eyes and lodged in his\r\nmustache. The mustache had begun to turn grey and Tom colored it with\r\ndye. There was oil in the preparation he used for the purpose and the\r\ntears, catching in the mustache and being brushed away by his hand,\r\nformed a fine mist-like vapor. In his grief Tom Willard\xe2\x80\x99s face looked\r\nlike the face of a little dog that has been out a long time in bitter\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nGeorge came home along Main Street at dark on the day of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath and, after going to his own room to brush his hair and clothes,\r\nwent along the hallway and into the room where the body lay. There was\r\na candle on the dressing table by the door and Doctor Reefy sat in a\r\nchair by the bed. The doctor arose and started to go out. He put out\r\nhis hand as though to greet the younger man and then awkwardly drew it\r\nback again. The air of the room was heavy with the presence of the two\r\nself-conscious human beings, and the man hurried away.\r\n\r\nThe dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s son sat down in a chair and looked at the floor. He\r\nagain thought of his own affairs and definitely decided he would make a\r\nchange in his life, that he would leave Winesburg. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go to some\r\ncity. Perhaps I can get a job on some newspaper,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and then\r\nhis mind turned to the girl with whom he was to have spent this evening\r\nand again he was half angry at the turn of events that had prevented\r\nhis going to her.\r\n\r\nIn the dimly lighted room with the dead woman the young man began to\r\nhave thoughts. His mind played with thoughts of life as his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind had played with the thought of death. He closed his eyes and\r\nimagined that the red young lips of Helen White touched his own lips.\r\nHis body trembled and his hands shook. And then something happened. The\r\nboy sprang to his feet and stood stiffly. He looked at the figure of\r\nthe dead woman under the sheets and shame for his thoughts swept over\r\nhim so that he began to weep. A new notion came into his mind and he\r\nturned and looked guiltily about as though afraid he would be observed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard became possessed of a madness to lift the sheet from the\r\nbody of his mother and look at her face. The thought that had come into\r\nhis mind gripped him terribly. He became convinced that not his mother\r\nbut someone else lay in the bed before him. The conviction was so real\r\nthat it was almost unbearable. The body under the sheets was long and\r\nin death looked young and graceful. To the boy, held by some strange\r\nfancy, it was unspeakably lovely. The feeling that the body before him\r\nwas alive, that in another moment a lovely woman would spring out of\r\nthe bed and confront him, became so overpowering that he could not bear\r\nthe suspense. Again and again he put out his hand. Once he touched and\r\nhalf lifted the white sheet that covered her, but his courage failed\r\nand he, like Doctor Reefy, turned and went out of the room. In the\r\nhallway outside the door he stopped and trembled so that he had to put\r\na hand against the wall to support himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not my mother.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not my mother in there,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to himself and again his\r\nbody shook with fright and uncertainty. When Aunt Elizabeth Swift, who\r\nhad come to watch over the body, came out of an adjoining room he put\r\nhis hand into hers and began to sob, shaking his head from side to\r\nside, half blind with grief. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and then\r\nforgetting the woman he turned and stared at the door through which he\r\nhad just come. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dear, the dear, oh the lovely dear,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy, urged\r\nby some impulse outside himself, muttered aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the eight hundred dollars the dead woman had kept hidden so long\r\nand that was to give George Willard his start in the city, it lay in\r\nthe tin box behind the plaster by the foot of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\nElizabeth had put it there a week after her marriage, breaking the\r\nplaster away with a stick. Then she got one of the workmen her husband\r\nwas at that time employing about the hotel to mend the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cI jammed\r\nthe corner of the bed against it,\xe2\x80\x9d she had explained to her husband,\r\nunable at the moment to give up her dream of release, the release that\r\nafter all came to her but twice in her life, in the moments when her\r\nlovers Death and Doctor Reefy held her in their arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOPHISTICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was early evening of a day in the late fall and the Winesburg County\r\nFair had brought crowds of country people into town. The day had been\r\nclear and the night came on warm and pleasant. On the Trunion Pike,\r\nwhere the road after it left town stretched away between berry fields\r\nnow covered with dry brown leaves, the dust from passing wagons arose\r\nin clouds. Children, curled into little balls, slept on the straw\r\nscattered on wagon beds. Their hair was full of dust and their fingers\r\nblack and sticky. The dust rolled away over the fields and the\r\ndeparting sun set it ablaze with colors.\r\n\r\nIn the main street of Winesburg crowds filled the stores and the\r\nsidewalks. Night came on, horses whinnied, the clerks in the stores ran\r\nmadly about, children became lost and cried lustily, an American town\r\nworked terribly at the task of amusing itself.\r\n\r\nPushing his way through the crowds in Main Street, young George Willard\r\nconcealed himself in the stairway leading to Doctor Reefy\xe2\x80\x99s office and\r\nlooked at the people. With feverish eyes he watched the faces drifting\r\npast under the store lights. Thoughts kept coming into his head and he\r\ndid not want to think. He stamped impatiently on the wooden steps and\r\nlooked sharply about. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, is she going to stay with him all day?\r\nHave I done all this waiting for nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willard, the Ohio village boy, was fast growing into manhood and\r\nnew thoughts had been coming into his mind. All that day, amid the jam\r\nof people at the Fair, he had gone about feeling lonely. He was about\r\nto leave Winesburg to go away to some city where he hoped to get work\r\non a city newspaper and he felt grown up. The mood that had taken\r\npossession of him was a thing known to men and unknown to boys. He felt\r\nold and a little tired. Memories awoke in him. To his mind his new\r\nsense of maturity set him apart, made of him a half-tragic figure. He\r\nwanted someone to understand the feeling that had taken possession of\r\nhim after his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nThere is a time in the life of every boy when he for the first time\r\ntakes the backward view of life. Perhaps that is the moment when he\r\ncrosses the line into manhood. The boy is walking through the street of\r\nhis town. He is thinking of the future and of the figure he will cut in\r\nthe world. Ambitions and regrets awake within him. Suddenly something\r\nhappens; he stops under a tree and waits as for a voice calling his\r\nname. Ghosts of old things creep into his consciousness; the voices\r\noutside of himself whisper a message concerning the limitations of\r\nlife. From being quite sure of himself and his future he becomes not at\r\nall sure. If he be an imaginative boy a door is torn open and for the\r\nfirst time he looks out upon the world, seeing, as though they marched\r\nin procession before him, the countless figures of men who before his\r\ntime have come out of nothingness into the world, lived their lives and\r\nagain disappeared into nothingness. The sadness of sophistication has\r\ncome to the boy. With a little gasp he sees himself as merely a leaf\r\nblown by the wind through the streets of his village. He knows that in\r\nspite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live and die in\r\nuncertainty, a thing blown by the winds, a thing destined like corn to\r\nwilt in the sun. He shivers and looks eagerly about. The eighteen years\r\nhe has lived seem but a moment, a breathing space in the long march of\r\nhumanity. Already he hears death calling. With all his heart he wants\r\nto come close to some other human, touch someone with his hands, be\r\ntouched by the hand of another. If he prefers that the other be a\r\nwoman, that is because he believes that a woman will be gentle, that\r\nshe will understand. He wants, most of all, understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen the moment of sophistication came to George Willard his mind\r\nturned to Helen White, the Winesburg banker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. Always he had\r\nbeen conscious of the girl growing into womanhood as he grew into\r\nmanhood. Once on a summer night when he was eighteen, he had walked\r\nwith her on a country road and in her presence had given way to an\r\nimpulse to boast, to make himself appear big and significant in her\r\neyes. Now he wanted to see her for another purpose. He wanted to tell\r\nher of the new impulses that had come to him. He had tried to make her\r\nthink of him as a man when he knew nothing of manhood and now he wanted\r\nto be with her and to try to make her feel the change he believed had\r\ntaken place in his nature.\r\n\r\nAs for Helen White, she also had come to a period of change. What\r\nGeorge felt, she in her young woman\xe2\x80\x99s way felt also. She was no longer\r\na girl and hungered to reach into the grace and beauty of womanhood.\r\nShe had come home from Cleveland, where she was attending college, to\r\nspend a day at the Fair. She also had begun to have memories. During\r\nthe day she sat in the grand-stand with a young man, one of the\r\ninstructors from the college, who was a guest of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s. The\r\nyoung man was of a pedantic turn of mind and she felt at once he would\r\nnot do for her purpose. At the Fair she was glad to be seen in his\r\ncompany as he was well dressed and a stranger. She knew that the fact\r\nof his presence would create an impression. During the day she was\r\nhappy, but when night came on she began to grow restless. She wanted to\r\ndrive the instructor away, to get out of his presence. While they sat\r\ntogether in the grand-stand and while the eyes of former schoolmates\r\nwere upon them, she paid so much attention to her escort that he grew\r\ninterested. \xe2\x80\x9cA scholar needs money. I should marry a woman with money,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe mused.\r\n\r\nHelen White was thinking of George Willard even as he wandered gloomily\r\nthrough the crowds thinking of her. She remembered the summer evening\r\nwhen they had walked together and wanted to walk with him again. She\r\nthought that the months she had spent in the city, the going to\r\ntheaters and the seeing of great crowds wandering in lighted\r\nthoroughfares, had changed her profoundly. She wanted him to feel and\r\nbe conscious of the change in her nature.\r\n\r\nThe summer evening together that had left its mark on the memory of\r\nboth the young man and woman had, when looked at quite sensibly, been\r\nrather stupidly spent. They had walked out of town along a country\r\nroad. Then they had stopped by a fence near a field of young corn and\r\nGeorge had taken off his coat and let it hang on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nstayed here in Winesburg\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve not yet gone away but I\xe2\x80\x99m growing\r\nup,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading books and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to try to amount to something in life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t the point. Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99d better quit\r\ntalking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe confused boy put his hand on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s arm. His voice trembled.\r\nThe two started to walk back along the road toward town. In his\r\ndesperation George boasted, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a big man, the biggest\r\nthat ever lived here in Winesburg,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to do\r\nsomething, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. Perhaps it is none of my business. I want\r\nyou to try to be different from other women. You see the point. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnone of my business I tell you. I want you to be a beautiful woman. You\r\nsee what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s voice failed and in silence the two came back into town and\r\nwent along the street to Helen White\xe2\x80\x99s house. At the gate he tried to\r\nsay something impressive. Speeches he had thought out came into his\r\nhead, but they seemed utterly pointless. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\xe2\x80\x94I used to think\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhad it in my mind you would marry Seth Richmond. Now I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas all he could find to say as she went through the gate and toward\r\nthe door of her house.\r\n\r\nOn the warm fall evening as he stood in the stairway and looked at the\r\ncrowd drifting through Main Street, George thought of the talk beside\r\nthe field of young corn and was ashamed of the figure he had made of\r\nhimself. In the street the people surged up and down like cattle\r\nconfined in a pen. Buggies and wagons almost filled the narrow\r\nthoroughfare. A band played and small boys raced along the sidewalk,\r\ndiving between the legs of men. Young men with shining red faces walked\r\nawkwardly about with girls on their arms. In a room above one of the\r\nstores, where a dance was to be held, the fiddlers tuned their\r\ninstruments. The broken sounds floated down through an open window and\r\nout across the murmur of voices and the loud blare of the horns of the\r\nband. The medley of sounds got on young Willard\xe2\x80\x99s nerves. Everywhere,\r\non all sides, the sense of crowding, moving life closed in about him.\r\nHe wanted to run away by himself and think. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she wants to stay with\r\nthat fellow she may. Why should I care? What difference does it make to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d he growled and went along Main Street and through Hern\xe2\x80\x99s Grocery\r\ninto a side street.\r\n\r\nGeorge felt so utterly lonely and dejected that he wanted to weep but\r\npride made him walk rapidly along, swinging his arms. He came to Wesley\r\nMoyer\xe2\x80\x99s livery barn and stopped in the shadows to listen to a group of\r\nmen who talked of a race Wesley\xe2\x80\x99s stallion, Tony Tip, had won at the\r\nFair during the afternoon. A crowd had gathered in front of the barn\r\nand before the crowd walked Wesley, prancing up and down boasting. He\r\nheld a whip in his hand and kept tapping the ground. Little puffs of\r\ndust arose in the lamplight. \xe2\x80\x9cHell, quit your talking,\xe2\x80\x9d Wesley\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid, I knew I had \xe2\x80\x99em beat all the time. I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOrdinarily George Willard would have been intensely interested in the\r\nboasting of Moyer, the horseman. Now it made him angry. He turned and\r\nhurried away along the street. \xe2\x80\x9cOld windbag,\xe2\x80\x9d he sputtered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does\r\nhe want to be bragging? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t he shut up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge went into a vacant lot and, as he hurried along, fell over a\r\npile of rubbish. A nail protruding from an empty barrel tore his\r\ntrousers. He sat down on the ground and swore. With a pin he mended the\r\ntorn place and then arose and went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Helen White\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk right in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that I want to see\r\nher. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk right in and sit down, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared, climbing over a fence and beginning to run.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the veranda of Banker White\xe2\x80\x99s house Helen was restless and\r\ndistraught. The instructor sat between the mother and daughter. His\r\ntalk wearied the girl. Although he had also been raised in an Ohio\r\ntown, the instructor began to put on the airs of the city. He wanted to\r\nappear cosmopolitan. \xe2\x80\x9cI like the chance you have given me to study the\r\nbackground out of which most of our girls come,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\ngood of you, Mrs. White, to have me down for the day.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to\r\nHelen and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYour life is still bound up with the life of this\r\ntown?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are people here in whom you are interested?\xe2\x80\x9d To\r\nthe girl his voice sounded pompous and heavy.\r\n\r\nHelen arose and went into the house. At the door leading to a garden at\r\nthe back she stopped and stood listening. Her mother began to talk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one here fit to associate with a girl of Helen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreeding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHelen ran down a flight of stairs at the back of the house and into the\r\ngarden. In the darkness she stopped and stood trembling. It seemed to\r\nher that the world was full of meaningless people saying words. Afire\r\nwith eagerness she ran through a garden gate and, turning a corner by\r\nthe banker\xe2\x80\x99s barn, went into a little side street. \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Where are\r\nyou, George?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, filled with nervous excitement. She stopped\r\nrunning, and leaned against a tree to laugh hysterically. Along the\r\ndark little street came George Willard, still saying words. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto walk right into her house. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go right in and sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared as he came up to her. He stopped and stared stupidly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and took hold of her hand. With hanging heads they walked\r\naway along the street under the trees. Dry leaves rustled under foot.\r\nNow that he had found her George wondered what he had better do and\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of the Fair Ground, in Winesburg, there is a half\r\ndecayed old grand-stand. It has never been painted and the boards are\r\nall warped out of shape. The Fair Ground stands on top of a low hill\r\nrising out of the valley of Wine Creek and from the grand-stand one can\r\nsee at night, over a cornfield, the lights of the town reflected\r\nagainst the sky.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Helen climbed the hill to the Fair Ground, coming by the\r\npath past Waterworks Pond. The feeling of loneliness and isolation that\r\nhad come to the young man in the crowded streets of his town was both\r\nbroken and intensified by the presence of Helen. What he felt was\r\nreflected in her.\r\n\r\nIn youth there are always two forces fighting in people. The warm\r\nunthinking little animal struggles against the thing that reflects and\r\nremembers, and the older, the more sophisticated thing had possession\r\nof George Willard. Sensing his mood, Helen walked beside him filled\r\nwith respect. When they got to the grand-stand they climbed up under\r\nthe roof and sat down on one of the long bench-like seats.\r\n\r\nThere is something memorable in the experience to be had by going into\r\na fair ground that stands at the edge of a Middle Western town on a\r\nnight after the annual fair has been held. The sensation is one never\r\nto be forgotten. On all sides are ghosts, not of the dead, but of\r\nliving people. Here, during the day just passed, have come the people\r\npouring in from the town and the country around. Farmers with their\r\nwives and children and all the people from the hundreds of little frame\r\nhouses have gathered within these board walls. Young girls have laughed\r\nand men with beards have talked of the affairs of their lives. The\r\nplace has been filled to overflowing with life. It has itched and\r\nsquirmed with life and now it is night and the life has all gone away.\r\nThe silence is almost terrifying. One conceals oneself standing\r\nsilently beside the trunk of a tree and what there is of a reflective\r\ntendency in his nature is intensified. One shudders at the thought of\r\nthe meaninglessness of life while at the same instant, and if the\r\npeople of the town are his people, one loves life so intensely that\r\ntears come into the eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness under the roof of the grand-stand, George Willard sat\r\nbeside Helen White and felt very keenly his own insignificance in the\r\nscheme of existence. Now that he had come out of town where the\r\npresence of the people stirring about, busy with a multitude of\r\naffairs, had been so irritating, the irritation was all gone. The\r\npresence of Helen renewed and refreshed him. It was as though her\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s hand was assisting him to make some minute readjustment of the\r\nmachinery of his life. He began to think of the people in the town\r\nwhere he had always lived with something like reverence. He had\r\nreverence for Helen. He wanted to love and to be loved by her, but he\r\ndid not want at the moment to be confused by her womanhood. In the\r\ndarkness he took hold of her hand and when she crept close put a hand\r\non her shoulder. A wind began to blow and he shivered. With all his\r\nstrength he tried to hold and to understand the mood that had come upon\r\nhim. In that high place in the darkness the two oddly sensitive human\r\natoms held each other tightly and waited. In the mind of each was the\r\nsame thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to this lonely place and here is this\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x9d was the substance of the thing felt.\r\n\r\nIn Winesburg the crowded day had run itself out into the long night of\r\nthe late fall. Farm horses jogged away along lonely country roads\r\npulling their portion of weary people. Clerks began to bring samples of\r\ngoods in off the sidewalks and lock the doors of stores. In the Opera\r\nHouse a crowd had gathered to see a show and further down Main Street\r\nthe fiddlers, their instruments tuned, sweated and worked to keep the\r\nfeet of youth flying over a dance floor.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness in the grand-stand Helen White and George Willard\r\nremained silent. Now and then the spell that held them was broken and\r\nthey turned and tried in the dim light to see into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\nThey kissed but that impulse did not last. At the upper end of the Fair\r\nGround a half dozen men worked over horses that had raced during the\r\nafternoon. The men had built a fire and were heating kettles of water.\r\nOnly their legs could be seen as they passed back and forth in the\r\nlight. When the wind blew the little flames of the fire danced crazily\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Helen arose and walked away into the darkness. They went\r\nalong a path past a field of corn that had not yet been cut. The wind\r\nwhispered among the dry corn blades. For a moment during the walk back\r\ninto town the spell that held them was broken. When they had come to\r\nthe crest of Waterworks Hill they stopped by a tree and George again\r\nput his hands on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. She embraced him eagerly and\r\nthen again they drew quickly back from that impulse. They stopped\r\nkissing and stood a little apart. Mutual respect grew big in them. They\r\nwere both embarrassed and to relieve their embarrassment dropped into\r\nthe animalism of youth. They laughed and began to pull and haul at each\r\nother. In some way chastened and purified by the mood they had been in,\r\nthey became, not man and woman, not boy and girl, but excited little\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIt was so they went down the hill. In the darkness they played like two\r\nsplendid young things in a young world. Once, running swiftly forward,\r\nHelen tripped George and he fell. He squirmed and shouted. Shaking with\r\nlaughter, he roiled down the hill. Helen ran after him. For just a\r\nmoment she stopped in the darkness. There was no way of knowing what\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts went through her mind but, when the bottom of the hill\r\nwas reached and she came up to the boy, she took his arm and walked\r\nbeside him in dignified silence. For some reason they could not have\r\nexplained they had both got from their silent evening together the\r\nthing needed. Man or boy, woman or girl, they had for a moment taken\r\nhold of the thing that makes the mature life of men and women in the\r\nmodern world possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung George Willard got out of bed at four in the morning. It was\r\nApril and the young tree leaves were just coming out of their buds. The\r\ntrees along the residence streets in Winesburg are maple and the seeds\r\nare winged. When the wind blows they whirl crazily about, filling the\r\nair and making a carpet underfoot.\r\n\r\nGeorge came downstairs into the hotel office carrying a brown leather\r\nbag. His trunk was packed for departure. Since two o\xe2\x80\x99clock he had been\r\nawake thinking of the journey he was about to take and wondering what\r\nhe would find at the end of his journey. The boy who slept in the hotel\r\noffice lay on a cot by the door. His mouth was open and he snored\r\nlustily. George crept past the cot and went out into the silent\r\ndeserted main street. The east was pink with the dawn and long streaks\r\nof light climbed into the sky where a few stars still shone.\r\n\r\nBeyond the last house on Trunion Pike in Winesburg there is a great\r\nstretch of open fields. The fields are owned by farmers who live in\r\ntown and drive homeward at evening along Trunion Pike in light creaking\r\nwagons. In the fields are planted berries and small fruits. In the late\r\nafternoon in the hot summers when the road and the fields are covered\r\nwith dust, a smoky haze lies over the great flat basin of land. To look\r\nacross it is like looking out across the sea. In the spring when the\r\nland is green the effect is somewhat different. The land becomes a wide\r\ngreen billiard table on which tiny human insects toil up and down.\r\n\r\nAll through his boyhood and young manhood George Willard had been in\r\nthe habit of walking on Trunion Pike. He had been in the midst of the\r\ngreat open place on winter nights when it was covered with snow and\r\nonly the moon looked down at him; he had been there in the fall when\r\nbleak winds blew and on summer evenings when the air vibrated with the\r\nsong of insects. On the April morning he wanted to go there again, to\r\nwalk again in the silence. He did walk to where the road dipped down by\r\na little stream two miles from town and then turned and walked silently\r\nback again. When he got to Main Street clerks were sweeping the\r\nsidewalks before the stores. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, you George. How does it feel to be\r\ngoing away?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked.\r\n\r\nThe westbound train leaves Winesburg at seven forty-five in the\r\nmorning. Tom Little is conductor. His train runs from Cleveland to\r\nwhere it connects with a great trunk line railroad with terminals in\r\nChicago and New York. Tom has what in railroad circles is called an\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceasy run.\xe2\x80\x9d Every evening he returns to his family. In the fall and\r\nspring he spends his Sundays fishing in Lake Erie. He has a round red\r\nface and small blue eyes. He knows the people in the towns along his\r\nrailroad better than a city man knows the people who live in his\r\napartment building.\r\n\r\nGeorge came down the little incline from the New Willard House at seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Tom Willard carried his bag. The son had become taller than\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\nOn the station platform everyone shook the young man\xe2\x80\x99s hand. More than\r\na dozen people waited about. Then they talked of their own affairs.\r\nEven Will Henderson, who was lazy and often slept until nine, had got\r\nout of bed. George was embarrassed. Gertrude Wilmot, a tall thin woman\r\nof fifty who worked in the Winesburg post office, came along the\r\nstation platform. She had never before paid any attention to George.\r\nNow she stopped and put out her hand. In two words she voiced what\r\neveryone felt. \xe2\x80\x9cGood luck,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply and then turning went on\r\nher way.\r\n\r\nWhen the train came into the station George felt relieved. He scampered\r\nhurriedly aboard. Helen White came running along Main Street hoping to\r\nhave a parting word with him, but he had found a seat and did not see\r\nher. When the train started Tom Little punched his ticket, grinned and,\r\nalthough he knew George well and knew on what adventure he was just\r\nsetting out, made no comment. Tom had seen a thousand George Willards\r\ngo out of their towns to the city. It was a commonplace enough incident\r\nwith him. In the smoking car there was a man who had just invited Tom\r\nto go on a fishing trip to Sandusky Bay. He wanted to accept the\r\ninvitation and talk over details.\r\n\r\nGeorge glanced up and down the car to be sure no one was looking, then\r\ntook out his pocket-book and counted his money. His mind was occupied\r\nwith a desire not to appear green. Almost the last words his father had\r\nsaid to him concerned the matter of his behavior when he got to the\r\ncity. \xe2\x80\x9cBe a sharp one,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Willard had said. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your eyes on your\r\nmoney. Be awake. That\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone think you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ngreenhorn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter George counted his money he looked out of the window and was\r\nsurprised to see that the train was still in Winesburg.\r\n\r\nThe young man, going out of his town to meet the adventure of life,\r\nbegan to think but he did not think of anything very big or dramatic.\r\nThings like his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, his departure from Winesburg, the\r\nuncertainty of his future life in the city, the serious and larger\r\naspects of his life did not come into his mind.\r\n\r\nHe thought of little things\xe2\x80\x94Turk Smollet wheeling boards through the\r\nmain street of his town in the morning, a tall woman, beautifully\r\ngowned, who had once stayed overnight at his father\xe2\x80\x99s hotel, Butch\r\nWheeler the lamp lighter of Winesburg hurrying through the streets on a\r\nsummer evening and holding a torch in his hand, Helen White standing by\r\na window in the Winesburg post office and putting a stamp on an\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nThe young man\xe2\x80\x99s mind was carried away by his growing passion for\r\ndreams. One looking at him would not have thought him particularly\r\nsharp. With the recollection of little things occupying his mind he\r\nclosed his eyes and leaned back in the car seat. He stayed that way for\r\na long time and when he aroused himself and again looked out of the car\r\nwindow the town of Winesburg had disappeared and his life there had\r\nbecome but a background on which to paint the dreams of his manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WINESBURG, OHIO ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
