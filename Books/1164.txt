To the historian it bristles with errors\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nerrors of fact, but errors of interpretation. Looking back across the\r\nseven centuries that have lapsed since Avis Everhard completed her\r\nmanuscript, events, and the bearings of events, that were confused and\r\nveiled to her, are clear to us. She lacked perspective. She was too\r\nclose to the events she writes about. Nay, she was merged in the events\r\nshe has described.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as a personal document, the Everhard Manuscript is of\r\ninestimable value. But here again enter error of perspective, and\r\nvitiation due to the bias of love. Yet we smile, indeed, and forgive\r\nAvis Everhard for the heroic lines upon which she modelled her husband.\r\nWe know to-day that he was not so colossal, and that he loomed among\r\nthe events of his times less largely than the Manuscript would lead us\r\nto believe.\r\n\r\nWe know that Ernest Everhard was an exceptionally strong man, but not\r\nso exceptional as his wife thought him to be. He was, after all, but\r\none of a large number of heroes who, throughout the world, devoted\r\ntheir lives to the Revolution; though it must be conceded that he did\r\nunusual work, especially in his elaboration and interpretation of\r\nworking-class philosophy. \xe2\x80\x9cProletarian science\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproletarian\r\nphilosophy\xe2\x80\x9d were his phrases for it, and therein he shows the\r\nprovincialism of his mind\xe2\x80\x94a defect, however, that was due to the times\r\nand that none in that day could escape.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Manuscript. Especially valuable is it in\r\ncommunicating to us the _feel_ of those terrible times. Nowhere do we\r\nfind more vividly portrayed the psychology of the persons that lived in\r\nthat turbulent period embraced between the years 1912 and 1932\xe2\x80\x94their\r\nmistakes and ignorance, their doubts and fears and misapprehensions,\r\ntheir ethical delusions, their violent passions, their inconceivable\r\nsordidness and selfishness. These are the things that are so hard for\r\nus of this enlightened age to understand. History tells us that these\r\nthings were, and biology and psychology tell us why they were; but\r\nhistory and biology and psychology do not make these things alive. We\r\naccept them as facts, but we are left without sympathetic comprehension\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThis sympathy comes to us, however, as we peruse the Everhard\r\nManuscript. We enter into the minds of the actors in that long-ago\r\nworld-drama, and for the time being their mental processes are our\r\nmental processes. Not alone do we understand Avis Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s love for\r\nher hero-husband, but we feel, as he felt, in those first days, the\r\nvague and terrible loom of the Oligarchy. The Iron Heel (well named) we\r\nfeel descending upon and crushing mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd in passing we note that that historic phrase, the Iron Heel,\r\noriginated in Ernest Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s mind. This, we may say, is the one moot\r\nquestion that this new-found document clears up. Previous to this, the\r\nearliest-known use of the phrase occurred in the pamphlet, \xe2\x80\x9cYe Slaves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwritten by George Milford and published in December, 1912. This George\r\nMilford was an obscure agitator about whom nothing is known, save the\r\none additional bit of information gained from the Manuscript, which\r\nmentions that he was shot in the Chicago Commune. Evidently he had\r\nheard Ernest Everhard make use of the phrase in some public speech,\r\nmost probably when he was running for Congress in the fall of 1912.\r\nFrom the Manuscript we learn that Everhard used the phrase at a private\r\ndinner in the spring of 1912. This is, without discussion, the\r\nearliest-known occasion on which the Oligarchy was so designated.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Oligarchy will always remain a cause of secret wonder\r\nto the historian and the philosopher. Other great historical events\r\nhave their place in social evolution. They were inevitable. Their\r\ncoming could have been predicted with the same certitude that\r\nastronomers to-day predict the outcome of the movements of stars.\r\nWithout these other great historical events, social evolution could not\r\nhave proceeded. Primitive communism, chattel slavery, serf slavery, and\r\nwage slavery were necessary stepping-stones in the evolution of\r\nsociety. But it were ridiculous to assert that the Iron Heel was a\r\nnecessary stepping-stone. Rather, to-day, is it adjudged a step aside,\r\nor a step backward, to the social tyrannies that made the early world a\r\nhell, but that were as necessary as the Iron Heel was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBlack as Feudalism was, yet the coming of it was inevitable. What else\r\nthan Feudalism could have followed upon the breakdown of that great\r\ncentralized governmental machine known as the Roman Empire? Not so,\r\nhowever, with the Iron Heel. In the orderly procedure of social\r\nevolution there was no place for it. It was not necessary, and it was\r\nnot inevitable. It must always remain the great curiosity of history\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwhim, a fantasy, an apparition, a thing unexpected and undreamed; and\r\nit should serve as a warning to those rash political theorists of\r\nto-day who speak with certitude of social processes.\r\n\r\nCapitalism was adjudged by the sociologists of the time to be the\r\nculmination of bourgeois rule, the ripened fruit of the bourgeois\r\nrevolution. And we of to-day can but applaud that judgment. Following\r\nupon Capitalism, it was held, even by such intellectual and\r\nantagonistic giants as Herbert Spencer, that Socialism would come. Out\r\nof the decay of self-seeking capitalism, it was held, would arise that\r\nflower of the ages, the Brotherhood of Man. Instead of which, appalling\r\nalike to us who look back and to those that lived at the time,\r\ncapitalism, rotten-ripe, sent forth that monstrous offshoot, the\r\nOligarchy.\r\n\r\nToo late did the socialist movement of the early twentieth century\r\ndivine the coming of the Oligarchy. Even as it was divined, the\r\nOligarchy was there\xe2\x80\x94a fact established in blood, a stupendous and awful\r\nreality. Nor even then, as the Everhard Manuscript well shows, was any\r\npermanence attributed to the Iron Heel. Its overthrow was a matter of a\r\nfew short years, was the judgment of the revolutionists. It is true,\r\nthey realized that the Peasant Revolt was unplanned, and that the First\r\nRevolt was premature; but they little realized that the Second Revolt,\r\nplanned and mature, was doomed to equal futility and more terrible\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that Avis Everhard completed the Manuscript during the\r\nlast days of preparation for the Second Revolt; hence the fact that\r\nthere is no mention of the disastrous outcome of the Second Revolt. It\r\nis quite clear that she intended the Manuscript for immediate\r\npublication, as soon as the Iron Heel was overthrown, so that her\r\nhusband, so recently dead, should receive full credit for all that he\r\nhad ventured and accomplished. Then came the frightful crushing of the\r\nSecond Revolt, and it is probable that in the moment of danger, ere she\r\nfled or was captured by the Mercenaries, she hid the Manuscript in the\r\nhollow oak at Wake Robin Lodge.\r\n\r\nOf Avis Everhard there is no further record. Undoubtedly she was\r\nexecuted by the Mercenaries; and, as is well known, no record of such\r\nexecutions was kept by the Iron Heel. But little did she realize, even\r\nthen, as she hid the Manuscript and prepared to flee, how terrible had\r\nbeen the breakdown of the Second Revolt. Little did she realize that\r\nthe tortuous and distorted evolution of the next three centuries would\r\ncompel a Third Revolt and a Fourth Revolt, and many Revolts, all\r\ndrowned in seas of blood, ere the world-movement of labor should come\r\ninto its own. And little did she dream that for seven long centuries\r\nthe tribute of her love to Ernest Everhard would repose undisturbed in\r\nthe heart of the ancient oak of Wake Robin Lodge.\r\n\r\nANTHONY MEREDITH\r\n\r\nARDIS,\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 419 B.O.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n THE IRON HEEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nMY EAGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soft summer wind stirs the redwoods, and Wild-Water ripples sweet\r\ncadences over its mossy stones. There are butterflies in the sunshine,\r\nand from everywhere arises the drowsy hum of bees. It is so quiet and\r\npeaceful, and I sit here, and ponder, and am restless. It is the quiet\r\nthat makes me restless. It seems unreal. All the world is quiet, but it\r\nis the quiet before the storm. I strain my ears, and all my senses, for\r\nsome betrayal of that impending storm. Oh, that it may not be\r\npremature! That it may not be premature![1]\r\n\r\n [1] The Second Revolt was largely the work of Ernest Everhard, though\r\n he co\xc3\xb6perated, of course, with the European leaders. The capture and\r\n secret execution of Everhard was the great event of the spring of 1932\r\n A.D. Yet so thoroughly had he prepared for the revolt, that his\r\n fellow-conspirators were able, with little confusion or delay, to\r\n carry out his plans. It was after Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s execution that his wife\r\n went to Wake Robin Lodge, a small bungalow in the Sonoma Hills of\r\n California.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that I am restless. I think, and think, and I cannot cease\r\nfrom thinking. I have been in the thick of life so long that I am\r\noppressed by the peace and quiet, and I cannot forbear from dwelling\r\nupon that mad maelstrom of death and destruction so soon to burst\r\nforth. In my ears are the cries of the stricken; and I can see, as I\r\nhave seen in the past,[2] all the marring and mangling of the sweet,\r\nbeautiful flesh, and the souls torn with violence from proud bodies and\r\nhurled to God. Thus do we poor humans attain our ends, striving through\r\ncarnage and destruction to bring lasting peace and happiness upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n [2] Without doubt she here refers to the Chicago Commune.\r\n\r\nAnd then I am lonely. When I do not think of what is to come, I think\r\nof what has been and is no more\xe2\x80\x94my Eagle, beating with tireless wings\r\nthe void, soaring toward what was ever his sun, the flaming ideal of\r\nhuman freedom. I cannot sit idly by and wait the great event that is\r\nhis making, though he is not here to see. He devoted all the years of\r\nhis manhood to it, and for it he gave his life. It is his handiwork. He\r\nmade it.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] With all respect to Avis Everhard, it must be pointed out that\r\n Everhard was but one of many able leaders who planned the Second\r\n Revolt. And we to-day, looking back across the centuries, can safely\r\n say that even had he lived, the Second Revolt would not have been less\r\n calamitous in its outcome than it was.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is, in this anxious time of waiting, that I shall write of my\r\nhusband. There is much light that I alone of all persons living can\r\nthrow upon his character, and so noble a character cannot be blazoned\r\nforth too brightly. His was a great soul, and, when my love grows\r\nunselfish, my chiefest regret is that he is not here to witness\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s dawn. We cannot fail. He has built too stoutly and too\r\nsurely for that. Woe to the Iron Heel! Soon shall it be thrust back\r\nfrom off prostrate humanity. When the word goes forth, the labor hosts\r\nof all the world shall rise. There has been nothing like it in the\r\nhistory of the world. The solidarity of labor is assured, and for the\r\nfirst time will there be an international revolution wide as the world\r\nis wide.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] The Second Revolt was truly international. It was a colossal\r\n plan\xe2\x80\x94too colossal to be wrought by the genius of one man alone. Labor,\r\n in all the oligarchies of the world, was prepared to rise at the\r\n signal. Germany, Italy, France, and all Australasia were labor\r\n countries\xe2\x80\x94socialist states. They were ready to lend aid to the\r\n revolution. Gallantly they did; and it was for this reason, when the\r\n Second Revolt was crushed, that they, too, were crushed by the united\r\n oligarchies of the world, their socialist governments being replaced\r\n by oligarchical governments.\r\n\r\nYou see, I am full of what is impending. I have lived it day and night\r\nutterly and for so long that it is ever present in my mind. For that\r\nmatter, I cannot think of my husband without thinking of it. He was the\r\nsoul of it, and how can I possibly separate the two in thought?\r\n\r\nAs I have said, there is much light that I alone can throw upon his\r\ncharacter. It is well known that he toiled hard for liberty and\r\nsuffered sore. How hard he toiled and how greatly he suffered, I well\r\nknow; for I have been with him during these twenty anxious years and I\r\nknow his patience, his untiring effort, his infinite devotion to the\r\nCause for which, only two months gone, he laid down his life.\r\n\r\nI shall try to write simply and to tell here how Ernest Everhard\r\nentered my life\xe2\x80\x94how I first met him, how he grew until I became a part\r\nof him, and the tremendous changes he wrought in my life. In this way\r\nmay you look at him through my eyes and learn him as I learned him\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nall save the things too secret and sweet for me to tell.\r\n\r\nIt was in February, 1912, that I first met him, when, as a guest of my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s[5] at dinner, he came to our house in Berkeley. I cannot say\r\nthat my very first impression of him was favorable. He was one of many\r\nat dinner, and in the drawing-room where we gathered and waited for all\r\nto arrive, he made a rather incongruous appearance. It was \xe2\x80\x9cpreacher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x9d as my father privately called it, and Ernest was certainly out\r\nof place in the midst of the churchmen.\r\n\r\n [5] John Cunningham, Avis Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s father, was a professor at the\r\n State University at Berkeley, California. His chosen field was\r\n physics, and in addition he did much original research and was greatly\r\n distinguished as a scientist. His chief contribution to science was\r\n his studies of the electron and his monumental work on the\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cIdentification of Matter and Energy,\xe2\x80\x9d wherein he established, beyond\r\n cavil and for all time, that the ultimate unit of matter and the\r\n ultimate unit of force were identical. This idea had been earlier\r\n advanced, but not demonstrated, by Sir Oliver Lodge and other students\r\n in the new field of radio-activity.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, his clothes did not fit him. He wore a ready-made\r\nsuit of dark cloth that was ill adjusted to his body. In fact, no\r\nready-made suit of clothes ever could fit his body. And on this night,\r\nas always, the cloth bulged with his muscles, while the coat between\r\nthe shoulders, what of the heavy shoulder-development, was a maze of\r\nwrinkles. His neck was the neck of a prize-fighter,[6] thick and\r\nstrong. So this was the social philosopher and ex-horseshoer my father\r\nhad discovered, was my thought. And he certainly looked it with those\r\nbulging muscles and that bull-throat. Immediately I classified him\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsort of prodigy, I thought, a Blind Tom[7] of the working class.\r\n\r\n [6] In that day it was the custom of men to compete for purses of\r\n money. They fought with their hands. When one was beaten into\r\n insensibility or killed, the survivor took the money.\r\n\r\n [7] This obscure reference applies to a blind negro musician who took\r\n the world by storm in the latter half of the nineteenth century of the\r\n Christian Era.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when he shook hands with me! His handshake was firm and\r\nstrong, but he looked at me boldly with his black eyes\xe2\x80\x94too boldly, I\r\nthought. You see, I was a creature of environment, and at that time had\r\nstrong class instincts. Such boldness on the part of a man of my own\r\nclass would have been almost unforgivable. I know that I could not\r\navoid dropping my eyes, and I was quite relieved when I passed him on\r\nand turned to greet Bishop Morehouse\xe2\x80\x94a favorite of mine, a sweet and\r\nserious man of middle age, Christ-like in appearance and goodness, and\r\na scholar as well.\r\n\r\nBut this boldness that I took to be presumption was a vital clew to the\r\nnature of Ernest Everhard. He was simple, direct, afraid of nothing,\r\nand he refused to waste time on conventional mannerisms. \xe2\x80\x9cYou pleased\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained long afterward; \xe2\x80\x9cand why should I not fill my eyes\r\nwith that which pleases me?\xe2\x80\x9d I have said that he was afraid of nothing.\r\nHe was a natural aristocrat\xe2\x80\x94and this in spite of the fact that he was\r\nin the camp of the non-aristocrats. He was a superman, a blond beast\r\nsuch as Nietzsche[8] has described, and in addition he was aflame with\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n [8] Friederich Nietzsche, the mad philosopher of the nineteenth\r\n century of the Christian Era, who caught wild glimpses of truth, but\r\n who, before he was done, reasoned himself around the great circle of\r\n human thought and off into madness.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of meeting the other guests, and what of my unfavorable\r\nimpression, I forgot all about the working-class philosopher, though\r\nonce or twice at table I noticed him\xe2\x80\x94especially the twinkle in his eye\r\nas he listened to the talk first of one minister and then of another.\r\nHe has humor, I thought, and I almost forgave him his clothes. But the\r\ntime went by, and the dinner went by, and he never opened his mouth to\r\nspeak, while the ministers talked interminably about the working class\r\nand its relation to the church, and what the church had done and was\r\ndoing for it. I noticed that my father was annoyed because Ernest did\r\nnot talk. Once father took advantage of a lull and asked him to say\r\nsomething; but Ernest shrugged his shoulders and with an \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nnothing to say\xe2\x80\x9d went on eating salted almonds.\r\n\r\nBut father was not to be denied. After a while he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have with us a member of the working class. I am sure that he can\r\npresent things from a new point of view that will be interesting and\r\nrefreshing. I refer to Mr. Everhard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others betrayed a well-mannered interest, and urged Ernest for a\r\nstatement of his views. Their attitude toward him was so broadly\r\ntolerant and kindly that it was really patronizing. And I saw that\r\nErnest noted it and was amused. He looked slowly about him, and I saw\r\nthe glint of laughter in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not versed in the courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nbegan, and then hesitated with modesty and indecision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d they urged, and Dr. Hammerfield said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not mind the\r\ntruth that is in any man. If it is sincere,\xe2\x80\x9d he amended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you separate sincerity from truth?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest laughed quickly.\r\n\r\nDr. Hammerfield gasped, and managed to answer, \xe2\x80\x9cThe best of us may be\r\nmistaken, young man, the best of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s manner changed on the instant. He became another man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cand let me begin by saying that you\r\nare all mistaken. You know nothing, and worse than nothing, about the\r\nworking class. Your sociology is as vicious and worthless as is your\r\nmethod of thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not so much what he said as how he said it. I roused at the\r\nfirst sound of his voice. It was as bold as his eyes. It was a\r\nclarion-call that thrilled me. And the whole table was aroused, shaken\r\nalive from monotony and drowsiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is so dreadfully vicious and worthless in our method of thinking,\r\nyoung man?\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield demanded, and already there was something\r\nunpleasant in his voice and manner of utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are metaphysicians. You can prove anything by metaphysics; and\r\nhaving done so, every metaphysician can prove every other metaphysician\r\nwrong\xe2\x80\x94to his own satisfaction. You are anarchists in the realm of\r\nthought. And you are mad cosmos-makers. Each of you dwells in a cosmos\r\nof his own making, created out of his own fancies and desires. You do\r\nnot know the real world in which you live, and your thinking has no\r\nplace in the real world except in so far as it is phenomena of mental\r\naberration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I was reminded of as I sat at table and listened to\r\nyou talk and talk? You reminded me for all the world of the scholastics\r\nof the Middle Ages who gravely and learnedly debated the absorbing\r\nquestion of how many angels could dance on the point of a needle. Why,\r\nmy dear sirs, you are as remote from the intellectual life of the\r\ntwentieth century as an Indian medicine-man making incantation in the\r\nprimeval forest ten thousand years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Ernest talked he seemed in a fine passion; his face glowed, his eyes\r\nsnapped and flashed, and his chin and jaw were eloquent with\r\naggressiveness. But it was only a way he had. It always aroused people.\r\nHis smashing, sledge-hammer manner of attack invariably made them\r\nforget themselves. And they were forgetting themselves now. Bishop\r\nMorehouse was leaning forward and listening intently. Exasperation and\r\nanger were flushing the face of Dr. Hammerfield. And others were\r\nexasperated, too, and some were smiling in an amused and superior way.\r\nAs for myself, I found it most enjoyable. I glanced at father, and I\r\nwas afraid he was going to giggle at the effect of this human bombshell\r\nhe had been guilty of launching amongst us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour terms are rather vague,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nprecisely what do you mean when you call us metaphysicians?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call you metaphysicians because you reason metaphysically,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cYour method of reasoning is the opposite to that of science.\r\nThere is no validity to your conclusions. You can prove everything and\r\nnothing, and no two of you can agree upon anything. Each of you goes\r\ninto his own consciousness to explain himself and the universe. As well\r\nmay you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps as to explain\r\nconsciousness by consciousness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d Bishop Morehouse said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that all\r\nthings of the mind are metaphysical. That most exact and convincing of\r\nall sciences, mathematics, is sheerly metaphysical. Each and every\r\nthought-process of the scientific reasoner is metaphysical. Surely you\r\nwill agree with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you say, you do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThe metaphysician\r\nreasons deductively out of his own subjectivity. The scientist reasons\r\ninductively from the facts of experience. The metaphysician reasons\r\nfrom theory to facts, the scientist reasons from facts to theory. The\r\nmetaphysician explains the universe by himself, the scientist explains\r\nhimself by the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God we are not scientists,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield murmured\r\ncomplacently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you then?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilosophers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have left the real and solid earth\r\nand are up in the air with a word for a flying machine. Pray come down\r\nto earth and tell me precisely what you do mean by philosophy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilosophy is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (Dr. Hammerfield paused and cleared his\r\nthroat)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csomething that cannot be defined comprehensively except to\r\nsuch minds and temperaments as are philosophical. The narrow scientist\r\nwith his nose in a test-tube cannot understand philosophy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest ignored the thrust. It was always his way to turn the point back\r\nupon an opponent, and he did it now, with a beaming brotherliness of\r\nface and utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will undoubtedly understand the definition I shall now make\r\nof philosophy. But before I make it, I shall challenge you to point out\r\nerror in it or to remain a silent metaphysician. Philosophy is merely\r\nthe widest science of all. Its reasoning method is the same as that of\r\nany particular science and of all particular sciences. And by that same\r\nmethod of reasoning, the inductive method, philosophy fuses all\r\nparticular sciences into one great science. As Spencer says, the data\r\nof any particular science are partially unified knowledge. Philosophy\r\nunifies the knowledge that is contributed by all the sciences.\r\nPhilosophy is the science of science, the master science, if you\r\nplease. How do you like my definition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery creditable, very creditable,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield muttered lamely.\r\n\r\nBut Ernest was merciless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d he warned, \xe2\x80\x9cmy definition is fatal to metaphysics. If you\r\ndo not now point out a flaw in my definition, you are disqualified\r\nlater on from advancing metaphysical arguments. You must go through\r\nlife seeking that flaw and remaining metaphysically silent until you\r\nhave found it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest waited. The silence was painful. Dr. Hammerfield was pained. He\r\nwas also puzzled. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s sledge-hammer attack disconcerted him. He\r\nwas not used to the simple and direct method of controversy. He looked\r\nappealingly around the table, but no one answered for him. I caught\r\nfather grinning into his napkin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another way of disqualifying the metaphysicians,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest\r\nsaid, when he had rendered Dr. Hammerfield\xe2\x80\x99s discomfiture complete.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudge them by their works. What have they done for mankind beyond the\r\nspinning of airy fancies and the mistaking of their own shadows for\r\ngods? They have added to the gayety of mankind, I grant; but what\r\ntangible good have they wrought for mankind? They philosophized, if you\r\nwill pardon my misuse of the word, about the heart as the seat of the\r\nemotions, while the scientists were formulating the circulation of the\r\nblood. They declaimed about famine and pestilence as being scourges of\r\nGod, while the scientists were building granaries and draining cities.\r\nThey builded gods in their own shapes and out of their own desires,\r\nwhile the scientists were building roads and bridges. They were\r\ndescribing the earth as the centre of the universe, while the\r\nscientists were discovering America and probing space for the stars and\r\nthe laws of the stars. In short, the metaphysicians have done nothing,\r\nabsolutely nothing, for mankind. Step by step, before the advance of\r\nscience, they have been driven back. As fast as the ascertained facts\r\nof science have overthrown their subjective explanations of things,\r\nthey have made new subjective explanations of things, including\r\nexplanations of the latest ascertained facts. And this, I doubt not,\r\nthey will go on doing to the end of time. Gentlemen, a metaphysician is\r\na medicine man. The difference between you and the Eskimo who makes a\r\nfur-clad blubber-eating god is merely a difference of several thousand\r\nyears of ascertained facts. That is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet the thought of Aristotle ruled Europe for twelve centuries,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr.\r\nBallingford announced pompously. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Aristotle was a metaphysician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Ballingford glanced around the table and was rewarded by nods and\r\nsmiles of approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour illustration is most unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou refer to\r\na very dark period in human history. In fact, we call that period the\r\nDark Ages. A period wherein science was raped by the metaphysicians,\r\nwherein physics became a search for the Philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s Stone, wherein\r\nchemistry became alchemy, and astronomy became astrology. Sorry the\r\ndomination of Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s thought!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Ballingford looked pained, then he brightened up and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted this horrible picture you have drawn, yet you must confess\r\nthat metaphysics was inherently potent in so far as it drew humanity\r\nout of this dark period and on into the illumination of the succeeding\r\ncenturies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMetaphysics had nothing to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not the thinking and the\r\nspeculation that led to the voyages of discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were disqualified. You\r\nhave not yet picked out the flaw in my definition of philosophy. You\r\nare now on an unsubstantial basis. But it is the way of the\r\nmetaphysicians, and I forgive you. No, I repeat, metaphysics had\r\nnothing to do with it. Bread and butter, silks and jewels, dollars and\r\ncents, and, incidentally, the closing up of the overland trade-routes\r\nto India, were the things that caused the voyages of discovery. With\r\nthe fall of Constantinople, in 1453, the Turks blocked the way of the\r\ncaravans to India. The traders of Europe had to find another route.\r\nHere was the original cause for the voyages of discovery. Columbus\r\nsailed to find a new route to the Indies. It is so stated in all the\r\nhistory books. Incidentally, new facts were learned about the nature,\r\nsize, and form of the earth, and the Ptolemaic system went glimmering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Hammerfield snorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not agree with me?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest queried. \xe2\x80\x9cThen wherein am I wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only reaffirm my position,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield retorted tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis too long a story to enter into now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo story is too long for the scientist,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said sweetly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\nwhy the scientist gets to places. That is why he got to America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shall not describe the whole evening, though it is a joy to me to\r\nrecall every moment, every detail, of those first hours of my coming to\r\nknow Ernest Everhard.\r\n\r\nBattle royal raged, and the ministers grew red-faced and excited,\r\nespecially at the moments when Ernest called them romantic\r\nphilosophers, shadow-projectors, and similar things. And always he\r\nchecked them back to facts. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact, man, the irrefragable fact!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwould proclaim triumphantly, when he had brought one of them a cropper.\r\nHe bristled with facts. He tripped them up with facts, ambuscaded them\r\nwith facts, bombarded them with broadsides of facts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to worship at the shrine of fact,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield taunted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no God but Fact, and Mr. Everhard is its prophet,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr.\r\nBallingford paraphrased.\r\n\r\nErnest smilingly acquiesced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m like the man from Texas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And, on being solicited, he\r\nexplained. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, the man from Missouri always says, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nshow me.\xe2\x80\x99 But the man from Texas says, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to put it in my\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x99 From which it is apparent that he is no metaphysician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother time, when Ernest had just said that the metaphysical\r\nphilosophers could never stand the test of truth, Dr. Hammerfield\r\nsuddenly demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the test of truth, young man? Will you kindly explain what has\r\nso long puzzled wiser heads than yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest answered. His cocksureness irritated them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nwise heads have puzzled so sorely over truth because they went up into\r\nthe air after it. Had they remained on the solid earth, they would have\r\nfound it easily enough\xe2\x80\x94ay, they would have found that they themselves\r\nwere precisely testing truth with every practical act and thought of\r\ntheir lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe test, the test,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield repeated impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\r\nthe preamble. Give us that which we have sought so long\xe2\x80\x94the test of\r\ntruth. Give it us, and we will be as gods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an impolite and sneering scepticism in his words and manner\r\nthat secretly pleased most of them at the table, though it seemed to\r\nbother Bishop Morehouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Jordan[9] has stated it very clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cHis test of\r\ntruth is: \xe2\x80\x98Will it work? Will you trust your life to it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [9] A noted educator of the late nineteenth and early twentieth\r\n centuries of the Christian Era. He was president of the Stanford\r\n University, a private benefaction of the times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPish!\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not taken Bishop\r\nBerkeley[10] into account. He has never been answered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [10] An idealistic monist who long puzzled the philosophers of that\r\n time with his denial of the existence of matter, but whose clever\r\n argument was finally demolished when the new empiric facts of science\r\n were philosophically generalized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe noblest metaphysician of them all,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut your\r\nexample is unfortunate. As Berkeley himself attested, his metaphysics\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Hammerfield was angry, righteously angry. It was as though he had\r\ncaught Ernest in a theft or a lie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d he trumpeted, \xe2\x80\x9cthat statement is on a par with all you\r\nhave uttered to-night. It is a base and unwarranted assumption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite crushed,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest murmured meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nhit me. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to put it in my hand, Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield spluttered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know? You do\r\nnot know that Bishop Berkeley attested that his metaphysics did not\r\nwork. You have no proof. Young man, they have always worked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take it as proof that Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s metaphysics did not work, because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nErnest paused calmly for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause Berkeley made an invariable\r\npractice of going through doors instead of walls. Because he trusted\r\nhis life to solid bread and butter and roast beef. Because he shaved\r\nhimself with a razor that worked when it removed the hair from his\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut those are actual things!\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hammerfield cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMetaphysics is\r\nof the mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they work\xe2\x80\x94in the mind?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest queried softly.\r\n\r\nThe other nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even a multitude of angels can dance on the point of a needle\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest went on reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd a blubber-eating, fur-clad\r\ngod can exist and work\xe2\x80\x94in the mind; and there are no proofs to the\r\ncontrary\xe2\x80\x94in the mind. I suppose, Doctor, you live in the mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind to me a kingdom is,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another way of saying that you live up in the air. But you come\r\nback to earth at meal-time, I am sure, or when an earthquake happens\r\nalong. Or, tell me, Doctor, do you have no apprehension in an\r\nearthquake that that incorporeal body of yours will be hit by an\r\nimmaterial brick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstantly, and quite unconsciously, Dr. Hammerfield\xe2\x80\x99s hand shot up to\r\nhis head, where a scar disappeared under the hair. It happened that\r\nErnest had blundered on an apposite illustration. Dr. Hammerfield had\r\nbeen nearly killed in the Great Earthquake[11] by a falling chimney.\r\nEverybody broke out into roars of laughter.\r\n\r\n [11] The Great Earthquake of 1906 A.D. that destroyed San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest asked, when the merriment had subsided. \xe2\x80\x9cProofs to the\r\ncontrary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in the silence he asked again, \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cStill well,\r\nbut not so well, that argument of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Hammerfield was temporarily crushed, and the battle raged on in\r\nnew directions. On point after point, Ernest challenged the ministers.\r\nWhen they affirmed that they knew the working class, he told them\r\nfundamental truths about the working class that they did not know, and\r\nchallenged them for disproofs. He gave them facts, always facts,\r\nchecked their excursions into the air, and brought them back to the\r\nsolid earth and its facts.\r\n\r\nHow the scene comes back to me! I can hear him now, with that war-note\r\nin his voice, flaying them with his facts, each fact a lash that stung\r\nand stung again. And he was merciless. He took no quarter,[12] and gave\r\nnone. I can never forget the flaying he gave them at the end:\r\n\r\n [12] This figure arises from the customs of the times. When, among men\r\n fighting to the death in their wild-animal way, a beaten man threw\r\n down his weapons, it was at the option of the victor to slay him or\r\n spare him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have repeatedly confessed to-night, by direct avowal or ignorant\r\nstatement, that you do not know the working class. But you are not to\r\nbe blamed for this. How can you know anything about the working class?\r\nYou do not live in the same locality with the working class. You herd\r\nwith the capitalist class in another locality. And why not? It is the\r\ncapitalist class that pays you, that feeds you, that puts the very\r\nclothes on your backs that you are wearing to-night. And in return you\r\npreach to your employers the brands of metaphysics that are especially\r\nacceptable to them; and the especially acceptable brands are acceptable\r\nbecause they do not menace the established order of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere there was a stir of dissent around the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am not challenging your sincerity,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nsincere. You preach what you believe. There lies your strength and your\r\nvalue\xe2\x80\x94to the capitalist class. But should you change your belief to\r\nsomething that menaces the established order, your preaching would be\r\nunacceptable to your employers, and you would be discharged. Every\r\nlittle while some one or another of you is so discharged.[13] Am I not\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [13] During this period there were many ministers cast out of the\r\n church for preaching unacceptable doctrine. Especially were they cast\r\n out when their preaching became tainted with socialism.\r\n\r\nThis time there was no dissent. They sat dumbly acquiescent, with the\r\nexception of Dr. Hammerfield, who said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is when their thinking is wrong that they are asked to resign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is another way of saying when their thinking is unacceptable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nErnest answered, and then went on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I say to you, go ahead and\r\npreach and earn your pay, but for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake leave the working\r\nclass alone. You belong in the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s camp. You have nothing in common\r\nwith the working class. Your hands are soft with the work others have\r\nperformed for you. Your stomachs are round with the plenitude of\r\neating.\xe2\x80\x9d (Here Dr. Ballingford winced, and every eye glanced at his\r\nprodigious girth. It was said he had not seen his own feet in years.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your minds are filled with doctrines that are buttresses of the\r\nestablished order. You are as much mercenaries (sincere mercenaries, I\r\ngrant) as were the men of the Swiss Guard.[14] Be true to your salt and\r\nyour hire; guard, with your preaching, the interests of your employers;\r\nbut do not come down to the working class and serve as false leaders.\r\nYou cannot honestly be in the two camps at once. The working class has\r\ndone without you. Believe me, the working class will continue to do\r\nwithout you. And, furthermore, the working class can do better without\r\nyou than with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [14] The hired foreign palace guards of Louis XVI, a king of France\r\n that was beheaded by his people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nCHALLENGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the guests had gone, father threw himself into a chair and gave\r\nvent to roars of Gargantuan laughter. Not since the death of my mother\r\nhad I known him to laugh so heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wager Dr. Hammerfield was never up against anything like it in\r\nhis life,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDid you notice how he began like a lamb\xe2\x80\x94Everhard, I mean, and how\r\nquickly he became a roaring lion? He has a splendidly disciplined mind.\r\nHe would have made a good scientist if his energies had been directed\r\nthat way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that I was deeply interested in Ernest Everhard. It\r\nwas not alone what he had said and how he had said it, but it was the\r\nman himself. I had never met a man like him. I suppose that was why, in\r\nspite of my twenty-four years, I had not married. I liked him; I had to\r\nconfess it to myself. And my like for him was founded on things beyond\r\nintellect and argument. Regardless of his bulging muscles and\r\nprize-fighter\xe2\x80\x99s throat, he impressed me as an ingenuous boy. I felt\r\nthat under the guise of an intellectual swashbuckler was a delicate and\r\nsensitive spirit. I sensed this, in ways I knew not, save that they\r\nwere my woman\xe2\x80\x99s intuitions.\r\n\r\nThere was something in that clarion-call of his that went to my heart.\r\nIt still rang in my ears, and I felt that I should like to hear it\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94and to see again that glint of laughter in his eyes that belied\r\nthe impassioned seriousness of his face. And there were further reaches\r\nof vague and indeterminate feelings that stirred in me. I almost loved\r\nhim then, though I am confident, had I never seen him again, that the\r\nvague feelings would have passed away and that I should easily have\r\nforgotten him.\r\n\r\nBut I was not destined never to see him again. My father\xe2\x80\x99s new-born\r\ninterest in sociology and the dinner parties he gave would not permit.\r\nFather was not a sociologist. His marriage with my mother had been very\r\nhappy, and in the researches of his own science, physics, he had been\r\nvery happy. But when mother died, his own work could not fill the\r\nemptiness. At first, in a mild way, he had dabbled in philosophy; then,\r\nbecoming interested, he had drifted on into economics and sociology. He\r\nhad a strong sense of justice, and he soon became fired with a passion\r\nto redress wrong. It was with gratitude that I hailed these signs of a\r\nnew interest in life, though I little dreamed what the outcome would\r\nbe. With the enthusiasm of a boy he plunged excitedly into these new\r\npursuits, regardless of whither they led him.\r\n\r\nHe had been used always to the laboratory, and so it was that he turned\r\nthe dining room into a sociological laboratory. Here came to dinner all\r\nsorts and conditions of men,\xe2\x80\x94scientists, politicians, bankers,\r\nmerchants, professors, labor leaders, socialists, and anarchists. He\r\nstirred them to discussion, and analyzed their thoughts of life and\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nHe had met Ernest shortly prior to the \xe2\x80\x9cpreacher\xe2\x80\x99s night.\xe2\x80\x9d And after\r\nthe guests were gone, I learned how he had met him, passing down a\r\nstreet at night and stopping to listen to a man on a soap-box who was\r\naddressing a crowd of workingmen. The man on the box was Ernest. Not\r\nthat he was a mere soap-box orator. He stood high in the councils of\r\nthe socialist party, was one of the leaders, and was the acknowledged\r\nleader in the philosophy of socialism. But he had a certain clear way\r\nof stating the abstruse in simple language, was a born expositor and\r\nteacher, and was not above the soap-box as a means of interpreting\r\neconomics to the workingmen.\r\n\r\nMy father stopped to listen, became interested, effected a meeting,\r\nand, after quite an acquaintance, invited him to the ministers\xe2\x80\x99 dinner.\r\nIt was after the dinner that father told me what little he knew about\r\nhim. He had been born in the working class, though he was a descendant\r\nof the old line of Everhards that for over two hundred years had lived\r\nin America.[1] At ten years of age he had gone to work in the mills,\r\nand later he served his apprenticeship and became a horseshoer. He was\r\nself-educated, had taught himself German and French, and at that time\r\nwas earning a meagre living by translating scientific and philosophical\r\nworks for a struggling socialist publishing house in Chicago. Also, his\r\nearnings were added to by the royalties from the small sales of his own\r\neconomic and philosophic works.\r\n\r\n [1] The distinction between being native born and foreign born was\r\n sharp and invidious in those days.\r\n\r\nThis much I learned of him before I went to bed, and I lay long awake,\r\nlistening in memory to the sound of his voice. I grew frightened at my\r\nthoughts. He was so unlike the men of my own class, so alien and so\r\nstrong. His masterfulness delighted me and terrified me, for my fancies\r\nwantonly roved until I found myself considering him as a lover, as a\r\nhusband. I had always heard that the strength of men was an\r\nirresistible attraction to women; but he was too strong. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncried out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible, absurd!\xe2\x80\x9d And on the morrow I awoke to\r\nfind in myself a longing to see him again. I wanted to see him\r\nmastering men in discussion, the war-note in his voice; to see him, in\r\nall his certitude and strength, shattering their complacency, shaking\r\nthem out of their ruts of thinking. What if he did swashbuckle? To use\r\nhis own phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cit worked,\xe2\x80\x9d it produced effects. And, besides, his\r\nswashbuckling was a fine thing to see. It stirred one like the onset of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed during which I read Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s books, borrowed from\r\nmy father. His written word was as his spoken word, clear and\r\nconvincing. It was its absolute simplicity that convinced even while\r\none continued to doubt. He had the gift of lucidity. He was the perfect\r\nexpositor. Yet, in spite of his style, there was much that I did not\r\nlike. He laid too great stress on what he called the class struggle,\r\nthe antagonism between labor and capital, the conflict of interest.\r\n\r\nFather reported with glee Dr. Hammerfield\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of Ernest, which\r\nwas to the effect that he was \xe2\x80\x9can insolent young puppy, made bumptious\r\nby a little and very inadequate learning.\xe2\x80\x9d Also, Dr. Hammerfield\r\ndeclined to meet Ernest again.\r\n\r\nBut Bishop Morehouse turned out to have become interested in Ernest,\r\nand was anxious for another meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cA strong young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand very much alive, very much alive. But he is too sure, too sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest came one afternoon with father. The Bishop had already arrived,\r\nand we were having tea on the veranda. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s continued presence in\r\nBerkeley, by the way, was accounted for by the fact that he was taking\r\nspecial courses in biology at the university, and also that he was hard\r\nat work on a new book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPhilosophy and Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d[2]\r\n\r\n [2] This book continued to be secretly printed throughout the three\r\n centuries of the Iron Heel. There are several copies of various\r\n editions in the National Library of Ardis.\r\n\r\nThe veranda seemed suddenly to have become small when Ernest arrived.\r\nNot that he was so very large\xe2\x80\x94he stood only five feet nine inches; but\r\nthat he seemed to radiate an atmosphere of largeness. As he stopped to\r\nmeet me, he betrayed a certain slight awkwardness that was strangely at\r\nvariance with his bold-looking eyes and his firm, sure hand that\r\nclasped for a moment in greeting. And in that moment his eyes were just\r\nas steady and sure. There seemed a question in them this time, and as\r\nbefore he looked at me over long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been reading your \xe2\x80\x98Working-class Philosophy,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and his\r\neyes lighted in a pleased way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou took into consideration the audience to\r\nwhich it was addressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, and it is because I did that I have a quarrel with you,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nchallenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too, have a quarrel with you, Mr. Everhard,\xe2\x80\x9d Bishop Morehouse said.\r\n\r\nErnest shrugged his shoulders whimsically and accepted a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop bowed and gave me precedence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou foment class hatred,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI consider it wrong and criminal to\r\nappeal to all that is narrow and brutal in the working class. Class\r\nhatred is anti-social, and, it seems to me, anti-socialistic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cClass hatred is neither in the text nor in\r\nthe spirit of anything I have ever written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried reproachfully, and reached for his book and opened it.\r\n\r\nHe sipped his tea and smiled at me while I ran over the pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPage one hundred and thirty-two,\xe2\x80\x9d I read aloud: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The class struggle,\r\ntherefore, presents itself in the present stage of social development\r\nbetween the wage-paying and the wage-paid classes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo mention there of class hatred,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou say \xe2\x80\x98class struggle.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA different thing from class hatred,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, believe me, we\r\nfoment no hatred. We say that the class struggle is a law of social\r\ndevelopment. We are not responsible for it. We do not make the class\r\nstruggle. We merely explain it, as Newton explained gravitation. We\r\nexplain the nature of the conflict of interest that produces the class\r\nstruggle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there should be no conflict of interest!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you heartily,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is what we socialists\r\nare trying to bring about,\xe2\x80\x94the abolition of the conflict of interest.\r\nPardon me. Let me read an extract.\xe2\x80\x9d He took his book and turned back\r\nseveral pages. \xe2\x80\x9cPage one hundred and twenty-six: \xe2\x80\x98The cycle of class\r\nstruggles which began with the dissolution of rude, tribal communism\r\nand the rise of private property will end with the passing of private\r\nproperty in the means of social existence.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I disagree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop interposed, his pale, ascetic\r\nface betraying by a faint glow the intensity of his feelings. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\npremise is wrong. There is no such thing as a conflict of interest\r\nbetween labor and capital\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, there ought not to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBy that last statement you have\r\ngiven me back my premise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should there be a conflict?\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop demanded warmly.\r\n\r\nErnest shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause we are so made, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are not so made!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you discussing the ideal man?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest asked, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94unselfish and\r\ngodlike, and so few in numbers as to be practically non-existent, or\r\nare you discussing the common and ordinary average man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe common and ordinary man,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is weak and fallible, prone to error?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBishop Morehouse nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd petty and selfish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch out!\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest warned. \xe2\x80\x9cI said \xe2\x80\x98selfish.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe average man IS selfish,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop affirmed valiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants all he can get?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants all he can get\xe2\x80\x94true but deplorable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s jaw snapped like a trap. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me show\r\nyou. Here is a man who works on the street railways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for capital,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, and you will grant that capital would perish if there were no\r\nlabor to earn the dividends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest insisted.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen our statements cancel each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said in a\r\nmatter-of-fact tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand we are where we were. Now to begin again. The\r\nworkingmen on the street railway furnish the labor. The stockholders\r\nfurnish the capital. By the joint effort of the workingmen and the\r\ncapital, money is earned.[3] They divide between them this money that\r\nis earned. Capital\xe2\x80\x99s share is called \xe2\x80\x98dividends.\xe2\x80\x99 Labor\xe2\x80\x99s share is\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x98wages.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [3] In those days, groups of predatory individuals controlled all the\r\n means of transportation, and for the use of same levied toll upon the\r\n public.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is no reason that the\r\ndivision should not be amicable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have already forgotten what we had agreed upon,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe agreed that the average man is selfish. He is the man that is. You\r\nhave gone up in the air and are arranging a division between the kind\r\nof men that ought to be but are not. But to return to the earth, the\r\nworkingman, being selfish, wants all he can get in the division. The\r\ncapitalist, being selfish, wants all he can get in the division. When\r\nthere is only so much of the same thing, and when two men want all they\r\ncan get of the same thing, there is a conflict of interest between\r\nlabor and capital. And it is an irreconcilable conflict. As long as\r\nworkingmen and capitalists exist, they will continue to quarrel over\r\nthe division. If you were in San Francisco this afternoon, you\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nto walk. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a street car running.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother strike?\xe2\x80\x9d[4] the Bishop queried with alarm.\r\n\r\n [4] These quarrels were very common in those irrational and anarchic\r\n times. Sometimes the laborers refused to work. Sometimes the\r\n capitalists refused to let the laborers work. In the violence and\r\n turbulence of such disagreements much property was destroyed and many\r\n lives lost. All this is inconceivable to us\xe2\x80\x94as inconceivable as\r\n another custom of that time, namely, the habit the men of the lower\r\n classes had of breaking the furniture when they quarrelled with their\r\n wives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they\xe2\x80\x99re quarrelling over the division of the earnings of the\r\nstreet railways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBishop Morehouse became excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is so short-sighted on the part of the\r\nworkingmen. How can they hope to keep our sympathy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we are compelled to walk,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said slyly.\r\n\r\nBut Bishop Morehouse ignored him and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir outlook is too narrow. Men should be men, not brutes. There will\r\nbe violence and murder now, and sorrowing widows and orphans. Capital\r\nand labor should be friends. They should work hand in hand and to their\r\nmutual benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now you are up in the air again,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest remarked dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nback to earth. Remember, we agreed that the average man is selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he ought not to be!\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there I agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d was Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought not to\r\nbe selfish, but he will continue to be selfish as long as he lives in a\r\nsocial system that is based on pig-ethics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was aghast, and my father chuckled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, pig-ethics,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest went on remorselessly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the meaning\r\nof the capitalist system. And that is what your church is standing for,\r\nwhat you are preaching for every time you get up in the pulpit.\r\nPig-ethics! There is no other name for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBishop Morehouse turned appealingly to my father, but he laughed and\r\nnodded his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid Mr. Everhard is right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_Laissez-faire_, the\r\nlet-alone policy of each for himself and devil take the hindmost. As\r\nMr. Everhard said the other night, the function you churchmen perform\r\nis to maintain the established order of society, and society is\r\nestablished on that foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not the teaching of Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Church is not teaching Christ these days,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest put in quickly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why the workingmen will have nothing to do with the Church.\r\nThe Church condones the frightful brutality and savagery with which the\r\ncapitalist class treats the working class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Church does not condone it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Church does not protest against it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in so\r\nfar as the Church does not protest, it condones, for remember the\r\nChurch is supported by the capitalist class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not looked at it in that light,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop said naively. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust be wrong. I know that there is much that is sad and wicked in this\r\nworld. I know that the Church has lost the\xe2\x80\x94what you call the\r\nproletariat.\xe2\x80\x9d[5]\r\n\r\n [5] _Proletariat:_ Derived originally from the Latin _proletarii_, the\r\n name given in the census of Servius Tullius to those who were of value\r\n to the state only as the rearers of offspring (_proles_); in other\r\n words, they were of no importance either for wealth, or position, or\r\n exceptional ability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never had the proletariat,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThe proletariat has\r\ngrown up outside the Church and without the Church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not follow you,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop said faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let me explain. With the introduction of machinery and the\r\nfactory system in the latter part of the eighteenth century, the great\r\nmass of the working people was separated from the land. The old system\r\nof labor was broken down. The working people were driven from their\r\nvillages and herded in factory towns. The mothers and children were put\r\nto work at the new machines. Family life ceased. The conditions were\r\nfrightful. It is a tale of blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Bishop Morehouse interrupted with an agonized\r\nexpression on his face. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was terrible. But it occurred a century and\r\na half ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there, a century and a half ago, originated the modern\r\nproletariat,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest continued. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Church ignored it. While a\r\nslaughter-house was made of the nation by the capitalist, the Church\r\nwas dumb. It did not protest, as to-day it does not protest. As Austin\r\nLewis[6] says, speaking of that time, those to whom the command \xe2\x80\x98Feed\r\nmy lambs\xe2\x80\x99 had been given, saw those lambs sold into slavery and worked\r\nto death without a protest.[7] The Church was dumb, then, and before I\r\ngo on I want you either flatly to agree with me or flatly to disagree\r\nwith me. Was the Church dumb then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [6] Candidate for Governor of California on the Socialist ticket in\r\n the fall election of 1906 Christian Era. An Englishman by birth, a\r\n writer of many books on political economy and philosophy, and one of\r\n the Socialist leaders of the times.\r\n\r\n [7] There is no more horrible page in history than the treatment of\r\n the child and women slaves in the English factories in the latter half\r\n of the eighteenth century of the Christian Era. In such industrial\r\n hells arose some of the proudest fortunes of that day.\r\n\r\nBishop Morehouse hesitated. Like Dr. Hammerfield, he was unused to this\r\nfierce \xe2\x80\x9cinfighting,\xe2\x80\x9d as Ernest called it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe history of the eighteenth century is written,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest prompted.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Church was not dumb, it will be found not dumb in the books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid the Church was dumb,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Church is dumb to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere I disagree,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop.\r\n\r\nErnest paused, looked at him searchingly, and accepted the challenge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us see. In Chicago there are women who toil\r\nall the week for ninety cents. Has the Church protested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is news to me,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cNinety cents per week! It is\r\nhorrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the Church protested?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Church does not know.\xe2\x80\x9d The Bishop was struggling hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet the command to the Church was, \xe2\x80\x98Feed my lambs,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest sneered.\r\nAnd then, the next moment, \xe2\x80\x9cPardon my sneer, Bishop. But can you wonder\r\nthat we lose patience with you? When have you protested to your\r\ncapitalistic congregations at the working of children in the Southern\r\ncotton mills?[8] Children, six and seven years of age, working every\r\nnight at twelve-hour shifts? They never see the blessed sunshine. They\r\ndie like flies. The dividends are paid out of their blood. And out of\r\nthe dividends magnificent churches are builded in New England, wherein\r\nyour kind preaches pleasant platitudes to the sleek, full-bellied\r\nrecipients of those dividends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [8] Everhard might have drawn a better illustration from the Southern\r\n Church\xe2\x80\x99s outspoken defence of chattel slavery prior to what is known\r\n as the \xe2\x80\x9cWar of the Rebellion.\xe2\x80\x9d Several such illustrations, culled from\r\n the documents of the times, are here appended. In 1835 A.D., the\r\n General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church resolved that: \xe2\x80\x9c_slavery\r\n is recognized in both the Old and the New Testaments, and is not\r\n condemned by the authority of God._\xe2\x80\x9d The Charleston Baptist\r\n Association issued the following, in an address, in 1835 A.D.: \xe2\x80\x9c_The\r\n right of masters to dispose of the time of their slaves has been\r\n distinctly recognized by the Creator of all things, who is surely at\r\n liberty to vest the right of property over any object whomsoever He\r\n pleases._\xe2\x80\x9d The Rev. E. D. Simon, Doctor of Divinity and professor in\r\n the Randolph-Macon Methodist College of Virginia, wrote: \xe2\x80\x9c_Extracts\r\n from Holy Writ unequivocally assert the right of property in slaves,\r\n together with the usual incidents to that right. The right to buy and\r\n sell is clearly stated. Upon the whole, then, whether we consult the\r\n Jewish policy instituted by God himself, or the uniform opinion and\r\n practice of mankind in all ages, or the injunctions of the New\r\n Testament and the moral law, we are brought to the conclusion that\r\n slavery is not immoral. Having established the point that the first\r\n African slaves were legally brought into bondage, the right to detain\r\n their children in bondage follows as an indispensable consequence.\r\n Thus we see that the slavery that exists in America was founded in\r\n right._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    It is not at all remarkable that this same note should have been\r\n    struck by the Church a generation or so later in relation to the\r\n    defence of capitalistic property. In the great museum at Asgard\r\n    there is a book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cEssays in Application,\xe2\x80\x9d written by Henry\r\n    van Dyke. The book was published in 1905 of the Christian Era. From\r\n    what we can make out, Van Dyke must have been a churchman. The book\r\n    is a good example of what Everhard would have called bourgeois\r\n    thinking. Note the similarity between the utterance of the\r\n    Charleston Baptist Association quoted above, and the following\r\n    utterance of Van Dyke seventy years later: \xe2\x80\x9c_The Bible teaches that\r\n    God owns the world. He distributes to every man according to His\r\n    own good pleasure, conformably to general laws._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop murmured faintly. His face was pale, and\r\nhe seemed suffering from nausea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have not protested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bishop shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the Church is dumb to-day, as it was in the eighteenth century?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was silent, and for once Ernest forbore to press the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do not forget, whenever a churchman does protest, that he is\r\ndischarged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly think that is fair,\xe2\x80\x9d was the objection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you protest?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me evils, such as you mention, in our own community, and I will\r\nprotest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am at your disposal. I will\r\ntake you on a journey through hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall protest.\xe2\x80\x9d The Bishop straightened himself in his chair,\r\nand over his gentle face spread the harshness of the warrior. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nChurch shall not be dumb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be discharged,\xe2\x80\x9d was the warning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall prove the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall prove, if what\r\nyou say is so, that the Church has erred through ignorance. And,\r\nfurthermore, I hold that whatever is horrible in industrial society is\r\ndue to the ignorance of the capitalist class. It will mend all that is\r\nwrong as soon as it receives the message. And this message it shall be\r\nthe duty of the Church to deliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest laughed. He laughed brutally, and I was driven to the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see but one side of the shield. There is much\r\ngood in us, though you give us credit for no good at all. Bishop\r\nMorehouse is right. The industrial wrong, terrible as you say it is, is\r\ndue to ignorance. The divisions of society have become too widely\r\nseparated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wild Indian is not so brutal and savage as the capitalist class,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe answered; and in that moment I hated him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know us,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not brutal and savage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProve it,\xe2\x80\x9d he challenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I prove it . . . to you?\xe2\x80\x9d I was growing angry.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not ask you to prove it to me. I ask you to\r\nprove it to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d was his rude reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, children,\xe2\x80\x9d father said soothingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I began indignantly, but Ernest interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you have money, or your father has, which is the same\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94money invested in the Sierra Mills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has that to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing much,\xe2\x80\x9d he began slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that the gown you wear is\r\nstained with blood. The food you eat is a bloody stew. The blood of\r\nlittle children and of strong men is dripping from your very\r\nroof-beams. I can close my eyes, now, and hear it drip, drop, drip,\r\ndrop, all about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd suiting the action to the words, he closed his eyes and leaned back\r\nin his chair. I burst into tears of mortification and hurt vanity. I\r\nhad never been so brutally treated in my life. Both the Bishop and my\r\nfather were embarrassed and perturbed. They tried to lead the\r\nconversation away into easier channels; but Ernest opened his eyes,\r\nlooked at me, and waved them aside. His mouth was stern, and his eyes\r\ntoo; and in the latter there was no glint of laughter. What he was\r\nabout to say, what terrible castigation he was going to give me, I\r\nnever knew; for at that moment a man, passing along the sidewalk,\r\nstopped and glanced in at us. He was a large man, poorly dressed, and\r\non his back was a great load of rattan and bamboo stands, chairs, and\r\nscreens. He looked at the house as if debating whether or not he should\r\ncome in and try to sell some of his wares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man\xe2\x80\x99s name is Jackson,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith that strong body of his he should be at work, and not\r\npeddling,\xe2\x80\x9d[9] I answered curtly.\r\n\r\n [9] In that day there were many thousands of these poor merchants\r\n called _pedlers_. They carried their whole stock in trade from door to\r\n door. It was a most wasteful expenditure of energy. Distribution was\r\n as confused and irrational as the whole general system of society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotice the sleeve of his left arm,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said gently.\r\n\r\nI looked, and saw that the sleeve was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was some of the blood from that arm that I heard dripping from your\r\nroof-beams,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said with continued gentleness. \xe2\x80\x9cHe lost his arm in\r\nthe Sierra Mills, and like a broken-down horse you turned him out on\r\nthe highway to die. When I say \xe2\x80\x98you,\xe2\x80\x99 I mean the superintendent and the\r\nofficials that you and the other stockholders pay to manage the mills\r\nfor you. It was an accident. It was caused by his trying to save the\r\ncompany a few dollars. The toothed drum of the picker caught his arm.\r\nHe might have let the small flint that he saw in the teeth go through.\r\nIt would have smashed out a double row of spikes. But he reached for\r\nthe flint, and his arm was picked and clawed to shreds from the finger\r\ntips to the shoulder. It was at night. The mills were working overtime.\r\nThey paid a fat dividend that quarter. Jackson had been working many\r\nhours, and his muscles had lost their resiliency and snap. They made\r\nhis movements a bit slow. That was why the machine caught him. He had a\r\nwife and three children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did the company do for him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Oh, yes, they did do something. They successfully fought the\r\ndamage suit he brought when he came out of hospital. The company\r\nemploys very efficient lawyers, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not told the whole story,\xe2\x80\x9d I said with conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cOr else\r\nyou do not know the whole story. Maybe the man was insolent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsolent! Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d His laughter was Mephistophelian. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat God!\r\nInsolent! And with his arm chewed off! Nevertheless he was a meek and\r\nlowly servant, and there is no record of his having been insolent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d I urged. \xe2\x80\x9cThe case would not have been decided\r\nagainst him had there been no more to the affair than you have\r\nmentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel Ingram is leading counsel for the company. He is a shrewd\r\nlawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest looked at me intently for a moment, then went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you what you do, Miss Cunningham. You investigate Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had already determined to,\xe2\x80\x9d I said coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he beamed good-naturedly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where to find\r\nhim. But I tremble for you when I think of all you are to prove by\r\nJackson\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that both the Bishop and I accepted Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchallenges. They went away together, leaving me smarting with a sense\r\nof injustice that had been done me and my class. The man was a beast. I\r\nhated him, then, and consoled myself with the thought that his behavior\r\nwas what was to be expected from a man of the working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nJACKSON\xe2\x80\x99S ARM\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle did I dream the fateful part Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s arm was to play in my\r\nlife. Jackson himself did not impress me when I hunted him out. I found\r\nhim in a crazy, ramshackle[1] house down near the bay on the edge of\r\nthe marsh. Pools of stagnant water stood around the house, their\r\nsurfaces covered with a green and putrid-looking scum, while the stench\r\nthat arose from them was intolerable.\r\n\r\n [1] An adjective descriptive of ruined and dilapidated houses in which\r\n great numbers of the working people found shelter in those days. They\r\n invariably paid rent, and, considering the value of such houses,\r\n enormous rent, to the landlords.\r\n\r\nI found Jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described. He was\r\nmaking some sort of rattan-work, and he toiled on stolidly while I\r\ntalked with him. But in spite of his meekness and lowliness, I fancied\r\nI caught the first note of a nascent bitterness in him when he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might a-given me a job as watchman,[2] anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [2] In those days thievery was incredibly prevalent. Everybody stole\r\n property from everybody else. The lords of society stole legally or\r\n else legalized their stealing, while the poorer classes stole\r\n illegally. Nothing was safe unless guarded. Enormous numbers of men\r\n were employed as watchmen to protect property. The houses of the\r\n well-to-do were a combination of safe deposit vault and fortress. The\r\n appropriation of the personal belongings of others by our own children\r\n of to-day is looked upon as a rudimentary survival of the\r\n theft-characteristic that in those early times was universal.\r\n\r\nI got little out of him. He struck me as stupid, and yet the deftness\r\nwith which he worked with his one hand seemed to belie his stupidity.\r\nThis suggested an idea to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in a slow and pondering way, and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. It just happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarelessness?\xe2\x80\x9d I prompted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t for callin\xe2\x80\x99 it that. I was workin\xe2\x80\x99\r\novertime, an\xe2\x80\x99 I guess I was tired out some. I worked seventeen years in\r\nthem mills, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve took notice that most of the accidents happens\r\njust before whistle-blow.[3] I\xe2\x80\x99m willin\xe2\x80\x99 to bet that more accidents\r\nhappens in the hour before whistle-blow than in all the rest of the\r\nday. A man ain\xe2\x80\x99t so quick after workin\xe2\x80\x99 steady for hours. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too\r\nmany of \xe2\x80\x99em cut up an\xe2\x80\x99 gouged an\xe2\x80\x99 chawed not to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [3] The laborers were called to work and dismissed by savage,\r\n screaming, nerve-racking steam-whistles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany of them?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundreds an\xe2\x80\x99 hundreds, an\xe2\x80\x99 children, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the terrible details, Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s story of his\r\naccident was the same as that I had already heard. When I asked him if\r\nhe had broken some rule of working the machinery, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI chucked off the belt with my right hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 made a reach\r\nfor the flint with my left. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop to see if the belt was off. I\r\nthought my right hand had done it\xe2\x80\x94only it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I reached quick, and\r\nthe belt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all the way off. And then my arm was chewed off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been painful,\xe2\x80\x9d I said sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crunchin\xe2\x80\x99 of the bones wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nice,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer.\r\n\r\nHis mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit. Only one thing was\r\nclear to him, and that was that he had not got any damages. He had a\r\nfeeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had\r\nbrought about the adverse decision of the court. Their testimony, as he\r\nput it, \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t what it ought to have ben.\xe2\x80\x9d And to them I resolved to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nOne thing was plain, Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s situation was wretched. His wife was in\r\nill health, and he was unable to earn, by his rattan-work and peddling,\r\nsufficient food for the family. He was back in his rent, and the oldest\r\nboy, a lad of eleven, had started to work in the mills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might a-given me that watchman\xe2\x80\x99s job,\xe2\x80\x9d were his last words as I\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had seen the lawyer who had handled Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case, and\r\nthe two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had testified,\r\nI began to feel that there was something after all in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontention.\r\n\r\nHe was a weak and inefficient-looking man, the lawyer, and at sight of\r\nhim I did not wonder that Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case had been lost. My first\r\nthought was that it had served Jackson right for getting such a lawyer.\r\nBut the next moment two of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s statements came flashing into my\r\nconsciousness: \xe2\x80\x9cThe company employs very efficient lawyers\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel Ingram is a shrewd lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d I did some rapid thinking. It\r\ndawned upon me that of course the company could afford finer legal\r\ntalent than could a workingman like Jackson. But this was merely a\r\nminor detail. There was some very good reason, I was sure, why\r\nJackson\xe2\x80\x99s case had gone against him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you lose the case?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment, and I found it in my\r\nheart to pity the wretched little creature. Then he began to whine. I\r\ndo believe his whine was congenital. He was a man beaten at birth. He\r\nwhined about the testimony. The witnesses had given only the evidence\r\nthat helped the other side. Not one word could he get out of them that\r\nwould have helped Jackson. They knew which side their bread was\r\nbuttered on. Jackson was a fool. He had been brow-beaten and confused\r\nby Colonel Ingram. Colonel Ingram was brilliant at cross-examination.\r\nHe had made Jackson answer damaging questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his side?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s right got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see all those\r\nbooks.\xe2\x80\x9d He moved his hand over the array of volumes on the walls of his\r\ntiny office. \xe2\x80\x9cAll my reading and studying of them has taught me that\r\nlaw is one thing and right is another thing. Ask any lawyer. You go to\r\nSunday-school to learn what is right. But you go to those books to\r\nlearn . . . law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me that Jackson had the right on his side and yet\r\nwas beaten?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried tentatively. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me that there\r\nis no justice in Judge Caldwell\xe2\x80\x99s court?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little lawyer glared at me a moment, and then the belligerence\r\nfaded out of his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a fair chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he began whining again. \xe2\x80\x9cThey made a fool out\r\nof Jackson and out of me, too. What chance had I? Colonel Ingram is a\r\ngreat lawyer. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great, would he have charge of the law\r\nbusiness of the Sierra Mills, of the Erston Land Syndicate, of the\r\nBerkeley Consolidated, of the Oakland, San Leandro, and Pleasanton\r\nElectric? He\xe2\x80\x99s a corporation lawyer, and corporation lawyers are not\r\npaid for being fools.[4] What do you think the Sierra Mills alone give\r\nhim twenty thousand dollars a year for? Because he\xe2\x80\x99s worth twenty\r\nthousand dollars a year to them, that\xe2\x80\x99s what for. I\xe2\x80\x99m not worth that\r\nmuch. If I was, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on the outside, starving and taking cases\r\nlike Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s. What do you think I\xe2\x80\x99d have got if I\xe2\x80\x99d won Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncase?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [4] The function of the corporation lawyer was to serve, by corrupt\r\n methods, the money-grabbing propensities of the corporations. It is on\r\n record that Theodore Roosevelt, at that time President of the United\r\n States, said in 1905 A.D., in his address at Harvard Commencement:\r\n \xe2\x80\x9c_We all know that, as things actually are, many of the most\r\n influential and most highly remunerated members of the Bar in every\r\n centre of wealth, make it their special task to work out bold and\r\n ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients, individual or\r\n corporate, can evade the laws which were made to regulate, in the\r\n interests of the public, the uses of great wealth._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d have robbed him, most probably,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I would,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to live, haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x9d[5]\r\n\r\n [5] A typical illustration of the internecine strife that permeated\r\n all society. Men preyed upon one another like ravening wolves. The big\r\n wolves ate the little wolves, and in the social pack Jackson was one\r\n of the least of the little wolves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a wife and children,\xe2\x80\x9d I chided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo have I a wife and children,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s not a soul\r\nin this world except myself that cares whether they starve or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face suddenly softened, and he opened his watch and showed me a\r\nsmall photograph of a woman and two little girls pasted inside the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are. Look at them. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a hard time, a hard time. I\r\nhad hoped to send them away to the country if I\xe2\x80\x99d won Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re not healthy here, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to send them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I started to leave, he dropped back into his whine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the ghost of a chance. Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell are\r\npretty friendly. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that if I\xe2\x80\x99d got the right kind of\r\ntestimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination, that friendship\r\nwould have decided the case. And yet I must say that Judge Caldwell did\r\na whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony. Why, Judge\r\nCaldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club.\r\nThey live in the same neighborhood\xe2\x80\x94one I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford. And their wives\r\nare always in and out of each other\xe2\x80\x99s houses. They\xe2\x80\x99re always having\r\nwhist parties and such things back and forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you think Jackson had the right of it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, pausing for\r\nthe moment on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think; I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd at first I thought he\r\nhad some show, too. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell my wife. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\ndisappoint her. She had her heart set on a trip to the country hard\r\nenough as it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not call attention to the fact that Jackson was trying to\r\nsave the machinery from being injured?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Peter Donnelly, one of\r\nthe foremen who had testified at the trial.\r\n\r\nHe pondered a long time before replying. Then he cast an anxious look\r\nabout him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve a good wife an\xe2\x80\x99 three of the sweetest children ye ever\r\nlaid eyes on, that\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, because it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a-ben healthy,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\nBut he interrupted passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean what I said. It\xe2\x80\x99s long years I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in the mills. I began\r\nas a little lad on the spindles. I worked up ever since. It\xe2\x80\x99s by hard\r\nwork I got to my present exalted position. I\xe2\x80\x99m a foreman, if you\r\nplease. An\xe2\x80\x99 I doubt me if there\xe2\x80\x99s a man in the mills that\xe2\x80\x99d put out a\r\nhand to drag me from drownin\xe2\x80\x99. I used to belong to the union. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nstayed by the company through two strikes. They called me \xe2\x80\x98scab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a man among \xe2\x80\x99em to-day to take a drink with me if I asked\r\nhim. D\xe2\x80\x99ye see the scars on me head where I was struck with flying\r\nbricks? There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a child at the spindles but what would curse me\r\nname. Me only friend is the company. It\xe2\x80\x99s not me duty, but me bread an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbutter an\xe2\x80\x99 the life of me children to stand by the mills. That\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Jackson to blame?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe should a-got the damages. He was a good worker an\xe2\x80\x99 never made\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you were not at liberty to tell the whole truth, as you had sworn\r\nto do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d I said\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\nAgain his face became impassioned, and he lifted it, not to me, but to\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d let me soul an\xe2\x80\x99 body burn in everlastin\xe2\x80\x99 hell for them children of\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer.\r\n\r\nHenry Dallas, the superintendent, was a vulpine-faced creature who\r\nregarded me insolently and refused to talk. Not a word could I get from\r\nhim concerning the trial and his testimony. But with the other foreman\r\nI had better luck. James Smith was a hard-faced man, and my heart sank\r\nas I encountered him. He, too, gave me the impression that he was not a\r\nfree agent, and as we talked I began to see that he was mentally\r\nsuperior to the average of his kind. He agreed with Peter Donnelly that\r\nJackson should have got damages, and he went farther and called the\r\naction heartless and cold-blooded that had turned the worker adrift\r\nafter he had been made helpless by the accident. Also, he explained\r\nthat there were many accidents in the mills, and that the company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npolicy was to fight to the bitter end all consequent damage suits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means hundreds of thousands a year to the stockholders,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\nand as he spoke I remembered the last dividend that had been paid my\r\nfather, and the pretty gown for me and the books for him that had been\r\nbought out of that dividend. I remembered Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s charge that my gown\r\nwas stained with blood, and my flesh began to crawl underneath my\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you testified at the trial, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t point out that Jackson\r\nreceived his accident through trying to save the machinery from\r\ndamage?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, and his mouth set bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntestified to the effect that Jackson injured himself by neglect and\r\ncarelessness, and that the company was not in any way to blame or\r\nliable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it carelessness?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall it that, or anything you want to call it. The fact is, a man gets\r\ntired after he\xe2\x80\x99s been working for hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was becoming interested in the man. He certainly was of a superior\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are better educated than most workingmen,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went through high school,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI worked my way through\r\ndoing janitor-work. I wanted to go through the university. But my\r\nfather died, and I came to work in the mills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to become a naturalist,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained shyly, as though\r\nconfessing a weakness. \xe2\x80\x9cI love animals. But I came to work in the\r\nmills. When I was promoted to foreman I got married, then the family\r\ncame, and . . . well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my own boss any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was explaining why I testified at the trial the way I did\xe2\x80\x94why I\r\nfollowed instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose instructions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel Ingram. He outlined the evidence I was to give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it lost Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and the blood began to rise darkly in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Jackson had a wife and two children dependent on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly, though his face was growing darker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwas it easy to make yourself over from what you\r\nwere, say in high school, to the man you must have become to do such a\r\nthing at the trial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of his outburst startled and frightened me. He ripped[6]\r\nout a savage oath, and clenched his fist as though about to strike me.\r\n\r\n [6] It is interesting to note the virilities of language that were\r\n common speech in that day, as indicative of the life, \xe2\x80\x98red of claw and\r\n fang,\xe2\x80\x99 that was then lived. Reference is here made, of course, not to\r\n the oath of Smith, but to the verb _ripped_ used by Avis Everhard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said the next moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was not easy. And\r\nnow I guess you can go away. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got all you wanted out of me. But\r\nlet me tell you this before you go. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do you any good to repeat\r\nanything I\xe2\x80\x99ve said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll deny it, and there are no witnesses. I\xe2\x80\x99ll deny\r\nevery word of it; and if I have to, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it under oath on the\r\nwitness stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter my interview with Smith I went to my father\xe2\x80\x99s office in the\r\nChemistry Building and there encountered Ernest. It was quite\r\nunexpected, but he met me with his bold eyes and firm hand-clasp, and\r\nwith that curious blend of his awkwardness and ease. It was as though\r\nour last stormy meeting was forgotten; but I was not in the mood to\r\nhave it forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been looking up Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case,\xe2\x80\x9d I said abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe was all interested attention, and waited for me to go on, though I\r\ncould see in his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to have been badly treated,\xe2\x80\x9d I confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94think some of\r\nhis blood is dripping from our roof-beams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Jackson and all his fellows were treated\r\nmercifully, the dividends would not be so large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never be able to take pleasure in pretty gowns again,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nI felt humble and contrite, and was aware of a sweet feeling that\r\nErnest was a sort of father confessor. Then, as ever after, his\r\nstrength appealed to me. It seemed to radiate a promise of peace and\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor will you be able to take pleasure in sackcloth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are the jute mills, you know, and the same thing goes on there.\r\nIt goes on everywhere. Our boasted civilization is based upon blood,\r\nsoaked in blood, and neither you nor I nor any of us can escape the\r\nscarlet stain. The men you talked with\xe2\x80\x94who were they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him all that had taken place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not one of them was a free agent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were all tied to\r\nthe merciless industrial machine. And the pathos of it and the tragedy\r\nis that they are tied by their heartstrings. Their children\xe2\x80\x94always the\r\nyoung life that it is their instinct to protect. This instinct is\r\nstronger than any ethic they possess. My father! He lied, he stole, he\r\ndid all sorts of dishonorable things to put bread into my mouth and\r\ninto the mouths of my brothers and sisters. He was a slave to the\r\nindustrial machine, and it stamped his life out, worked him to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you,\xe2\x80\x9d I interjected. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are surely a free agent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot wholly,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not tied by my heartstrings. I am often\r\nthankful that I have no children, and I dearly love children. Yet if I\r\nmarried I should not dare to have any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat surely is bad doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is expedient doctrine. I am a\r\nrevolutionist, and it is a perilous vocation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I tried to enter your father\xe2\x80\x99s house at night to steal his\r\ndividends from the Sierra Mills, what would he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sleeps with a revolver on the stand by the bed,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nwould most probably shoot you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I and a few others should lead a million and a half of men[7]\r\ninto the houses of all the well-to-do, there would be a great deal of\r\nshooting, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [7] This reference is to the socialist vote cast in the United States\r\n in 1910. The rise of this vote clearly indicates the swift growth of\r\n the party of revolution. Its voting strength in the United States in\r\n 1888 was 2068; in 1902, 127,713; in 1904, 435,040; in 1908, 1,108,427;\r\n and in 1910, 1,688,211.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you are not doing that,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is precisely what I am doing. And we intend to take, not the mere\r\nwealth in the houses, but all the sources of that wealth, all the\r\nmines, and railroads, and factories, and banks, and stores. That is the\r\nrevolution. It is truly perilous. There will be more shooting, I am\r\nafraid, than even I dream of. But as I was saying, no one to-day is a\r\nfree agent. We are all caught up in the wheels and cogs of the\r\nindustrial machine. You found that you were, and that the men you\r\ntalked with were. Talk with more of them. Go and see Colonel Ingram.\r\nLook up the reporters that kept Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case out of the papers, and\r\nthe editors that run the papers. You will find them all slaves of the\r\nmachine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little later in our conversation I asked him a simple little question\r\nabout the liability of workingmen to accidents, and received a\r\nstatistical lecture in return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all in the books,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe figures have been gathered, and\r\nit has been proved conclusively that accidents rarely occur in the\r\nfirst hours of the morning work, but that they increase rapidly in the\r\nsucceeding hours as the workers grow tired and slower in both their\r\nmuscular and mental processes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do you know that your father has three times as many chances for\r\nsafety of life and limb than has a working-man? He has. The\r\ninsurance[8] companies know. They will charge him four dollars and\r\ntwenty cents a year on a thousand-dollar accident policy, and for the\r\nsame policy they will charge a laborer fifteen dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [8] In the terrible wolf-struggle of those centuries, no man was\r\n permanently safe, no matter how much wealth he amassed. Out of fear\r\n for the welfare of their families, men devised the scheme of\r\n insurance. To us, in this intelligent age, such a device is laughably\r\n absurd and primitive. But in that age insurance was a very serious\r\n matter. The amusing part of it is that the funds of the insurance\r\n companies were frequently plundered and wasted by the very officials\r\n who were intrusted with the management of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked; and in the moment of asking I was aware of a\r\nsolicitude that was something more than slight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as a revolutionist, I have about eight chances to the workingman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none of being injured or killed,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe insurance\r\ncompanies charge the highly trained chemists that handle explosives\r\neight times what they charge the workingmen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ninsure me at all. Why did you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eyes fluttered, and I could feel the blood warm in my face. It was\r\nnot that he had caught me in my solicitude, but that I had caught\r\nmyself, and in his presence.\r\n\r\nJust then my father came in and began making preparations to depart\r\nwith me. Ernest returned some books he had borrowed, and went away\r\nfirst. But just as he was going, he turned and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the way, while you are ruining your own peace of mind and I am\r\nruining the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s, you\xe2\x80\x99d better look up Mrs. Wickson and Mrs.\r\nPertonwaithe. Their husbands, you know, are the two principal\r\nstockholders in the Mills. Like all the rest of humanity, those two\r\nwomen are tied to the machine, but they are so tied that they sit on\r\ntop of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nSLAVES OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s arm, the more shaken I was. I was\r\nconfronted by the concrete. For the first time I was seeing life. My\r\nuniversity life, and study and culture, had not been real. I had\r\nlearned nothing but theories of life and society that looked all very\r\nwell on the printed page, but now I had seen life itself. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\nwas a fact of life. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact, man, the irrefragable fact!\xe2\x80\x9d of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas ringing in my consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt seemed monstrous, impossible, that our whole society was based upon\r\nblood. And yet there was Jackson. I could not get away from him.\r\nConstantly my thought swung back to him as the compass to the Pole. He\r\nhad been monstrously treated. His blood had not been paid for in order\r\nthat a larger dividend might be paid. And I knew a score of happy\r\ncomplacent families that had received those dividends and by that much\r\nhad profited by Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s blood. If one man could be so monstrously\r\ntreated and society move on its way unheeding, might not many men be so\r\nmonstrously treated? I remembered Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s women of Chicago who toiled\r\nfor ninety cents a week, and the child slaves of the Southern cotton\r\nmills he had described. And I could see their wan white hands, from\r\nwhich the blood had been pressed, at work upon the cloth out of which\r\nhad been made my gown. And then I thought of the Sierra Mills and the\r\ndividends that had been paid, and I saw the blood of Jackson upon my\r\ngown as well. Jackson I could not escape. Always my meditations led me\r\nback to him.\r\n\r\nDown in the depths of me I had a feeling that I stood on the edge of a\r\nprecipice. It was as though I were about to see a new and awful\r\nrevelation of life. And not I alone. My whole world was turning over.\r\nThere was my father. I could see the effect Ernest was beginning to\r\nhave on him. And then there was the Bishop. When I had last seen him he\r\nhad looked a sick man. He was at high nervous tension, and in his eyes\r\nthere was unspeakable horror. From the little I learned I knew that\r\nErnest had been keeping his promise of taking him through hell. But\r\nwhat scenes of hell the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had seen, I knew not, for he\r\nseemed too stunned to speak about them.\r\n\r\nOnce, the feeling strong upon me that my little world and all the world\r\nwas turning over, I thought of Ernest as the cause of it; and also I\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cWe were so happy and peaceful before he came!\xe2\x80\x9d And the next\r\nmoment I was aware that the thought was a treason against truth, and\r\nErnest rose before me transfigured, the apostle of truth, with shining\r\nbrows and the fearlessness of one of God\xe2\x80\x99s own angels, battling for the\r\ntruth and the right, and battling for the succor of the poor and lonely\r\nand oppressed. And then there arose before me another figure, the\r\nChrist! He, too, had taken the part of the lowly and oppressed, and\r\nagainst all the established power of priest and pharisee. And I\r\nremembered his end upon the cross, and my heart contracted with a pang\r\nas I thought of Ernest. Was he, too, destined for a cross?\xe2\x80\x94he, with his\r\nclarion call and war-noted voice, and all the fine man\xe2\x80\x99s vigor of him!\r\n\r\nAnd in that moment I knew that I loved him, and that I was melting with\r\ndesire to comfort him. I thought of his life. A sordid, harsh, and\r\nmeagre life it must have been. And I thought of his father, who had\r\nlied and stolen for him and been worked to death. And he himself had\r\ngone into the mills when he was ten! All my heart seemed bursting with\r\ndesire to fold my arms around him, and to rest his head on my\r\nbreast\xe2\x80\x94his head that must be weary with so many thoughts; and to give\r\nhim rest\xe2\x80\x94just rest\xe2\x80\x94and easement and forgetfulness for a tender space.\r\n\r\nI met Colonel Ingram at a church reception. Him I knew well and had\r\nknown well for many years. I trapped him behind large palms and rubber\r\nplants, though he did not know he was trapped. He met me with the\r\nconventional gayety and gallantry. He was ever a graceful man,\r\ndiplomatic, tactful, and considerate. And as for appearance, he was the\r\nmost distinguished-looking man in our society. Beside him even the\r\nvenerable head of the university looked tawdry and small.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I found Colonel Ingram situated the same as the unlettered\r\nmechanics. He was not a free agent. He, too, was bound upon the wheel.\r\nI shall never forget the change in him when I mentioned Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case.\r\nHis smiling good nature vanished like a ghost. A sudden, frightful\r\nexpression distorted his well-bred face. I felt the same alarm that I\r\nhad felt when James Smith broke out. But Colonel Ingram did not curse.\r\nThat was the slight difference that was left between the workingman and\r\nhim. He was famed as a wit, but he had no wit now. And, unconsciously,\r\nthis way and that he glanced for avenues of escape. But he was trapped\r\namid the palms and rubber trees.\r\n\r\nOh, he was sick of the sound of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s name. Why had I brought the\r\nmatter up? He did not relish my joke. It was poor taste on my part, and\r\nvery inconsiderate. Did I not know that in his profession personal\r\nfeelings did not count? He left his personal feelings at home when he\r\nwent down to the office. At the office he had only professional\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould Jackson have received damages?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, personally, I have a feeling that\r\nhe should. But that has nothing to do with the legal aspects of the\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was getting his scattered wits slightly in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, has right anything to do with the law?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have used the wrong initial consonant,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried; and he nodded his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet we are supposed to\r\nget justice by means of the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the paradox of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he countered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do get justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are speaking professionally now, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nColonel Ingram blushed, actually blushed, and again he looked anxiously\r\nabout him for a way of escape. But I blocked his path and did not offer\r\nto move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen one surrenders his personal feelings to his\r\nprofessional feelings, may not the action be defined as a sort of\r\nspiritual mayhem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not get an answer. Colonel Ingram had ingloriously bolted,\r\noverturning a palm in his flight.\r\n\r\nNext I tried the newspapers. I wrote a quiet, restrained, dispassionate\r\naccount of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case. I made no charges against the men with whom\r\nI had talked, nor, for that matter, did I even mention them. I gave the\r\nactual facts of the case, the long years Jackson had worked in the\r\nmills, his effort to save the machinery from damage and the consequent\r\naccident, and his own present wretched and starving condition. The\r\nthree local newspapers rejected my communication, likewise did the two\r\nweeklies.\r\n\r\nI got hold of Percy Layton. He was a graduate of the university, had\r\ngone in for journalism, and was then serving his apprenticeship as\r\nreporter on the most influential of the three newspapers. He smiled\r\nwhen I asked him the reason the newspapers suppressed all mention of\r\nJackson or his case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEditorial policy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have nothing to do with that. It\xe2\x80\x99s up\r\nto the editors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why is it policy?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all solid with the corporations,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you paid\r\nadvertising rates, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any such matter into the papers. A\r\nman who tried to smuggle it in would lose his job. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it\r\nin if you paid ten times the regular advertising rates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about your own policy?\xe2\x80\x9d I questioned. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would seem your function\r\nis to twist truth at the command of your employers, who, in turn, obey\r\nthe behests of the corporations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked uncomfortable for the\r\nmoment, then brightened as he saw his way out. \xe2\x80\x9cI, myself, do not write\r\nuntruthful things. I keep square all right with my own conscience. Of\r\ncourse, there\xe2\x80\x99s lots that\xe2\x80\x99s repugnant in the course of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\nBut then, you see, that\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up\r\nboyishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you expect to sit at an editor\xe2\x80\x99s desk some day and conduct a\r\npolicy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be case-hardened by that time,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you are not yet case-hardened, tell me what you think right now\r\nabout the general editorial policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t kick over the ropes if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s going to succeed in journalism. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that much, at any\r\nrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he nodded his young head sagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the right?\xe2\x80\x9d I persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the game. Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, because it\r\ncomes out all right, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelightfully vague,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured; but my heart was aching for the youth\r\nof him, and I felt that I must either scream or burst into tears.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to see through the appearances of the society in which\r\nI had always lived, and to find the frightful realities that were\r\nbeneath. There seemed a tacit conspiracy against Jackson, and I was\r\naware of a thrill of sympathy for the whining lawyer who had\r\ningloriously fought his case. But this tacit conspiracy grew large. Not\r\nalone was it aimed against Jackson. It was aimed against every\r\nworkingman who was maimed in the mills. And if against every man in the\r\nmills, why not against every man in all the other mills and factories?\r\nIn fact, was it not true of all the industries?\r\n\r\nAnd if this was so, then society was a lie. I shrank back from my own\r\nconclusions. It was too terrible and awful to be true. But there was\r\nJackson, and Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and the blood that stained my gown and\r\ndripped from my own roof-beams. And there were many Jacksons\xe2\x80\x94hundreds\r\nof them in the mills alone, as Jackson himself had said. Jackson I\r\ncould not escape.\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. Wickson and Mr. Pertonwaithe, the two men who held most of\r\nthe stock in the Sierra Mills. But I could not shake them as I had\r\nshaken the mechanics in their employ. I discovered that they had an\r\nethic superior to that of the rest of society. It was what I may call\r\nthe aristocratic ethic or the master ethic.[1] They talked in large\r\nways of policy, and they identified policy and right. And to me they\r\ntalked in fatherly ways, patronizing my youth and inexperience. They\r\nwere the most hopeless of all I had encountered in my quest. They\r\nbelieved absolutely that their conduct was right. There was no question\r\nabout it, no discussion. They were convinced that they were the\r\nsaviours of society, and that it was they who made happiness for the\r\nmany. And they drew pathetic pictures of what would be the sufferings\r\nof the working class were it not for the employment that they, and they\r\nalone, by their wisdom, provided for it.\r\n\r\n [1] Before Avis Everhard was born, John Stuart Mill, in his essay, _On\r\n Liberty_, wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cWherever there is an ascendant class, a large\r\n portion of the morality emanates from its class interests and its\r\n class feelings of superiority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFresh from these two masters, I met Ernest and related my experience.\r\nHe looked at me with a pleased expression, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, this is fine. You are beginning to dig truth for yourself. It\r\nis your own empirical generalization, and it is correct. No man in the\r\nindustrial machine is a free-will agent, except the large capitalist,\r\nand he isn\xe2\x80\x99t, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon the Irishism.[2] You see, the masters\r\nare quite sure that they are right in what they are doing. That is the\r\ncrowning absurdity of the whole situation. They are so tied by their\r\nhuman nature that they can\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing unless they think it is right.\r\nThey must have a sanction for their acts.\r\n\r\n [2] Verbal contradictions, called _bulls_, were long an amiable\r\n weakness of the ancient Irish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they want to do a thing, in business of course, they must wait\r\ntill there arises in their brains, somehow, a religious, or ethical, or\r\nscientific, or philosophic, concept that the thing is right. And then\r\nthey go ahead and do it, unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the\r\nhuman mind is that the wish is parent to the thought. No matter what\r\nthey want to do, the sanction always comes. They are superficial\r\ncasuists. They are Jesuitical. They even see their way to doing wrong\r\nthat right may come of it. One of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions\r\nthey have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in\r\nwisdom and efficiency. Therefrom comes their sanction to manage the\r\nbread and butter of the rest of mankind. They have even resurrected the\r\ntheory of the divine right of kings\xe2\x80\x94commercial kings in their case.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] The newspapers, in 1902 of that era, credited the president of the\r\n Anthracite Coal Trust, George F. Baer, with the enunciation of the\r\n following principle: \xe2\x80\x9c_The rights and interests of the laboring man\r\n will be protected by the Christian men to whom God in His infinite\r\n wisdom has given the property interests of the country._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe weakness in their position lies in that they are merely business\r\nmen. They are not philosophers. They are not biologists nor\r\nsociologists. If they were, of course all would be well. A business man\r\nwho was also a biologist and a sociologist would know, approximately,\r\nthe right thing to do for humanity. But, outside the realm of business,\r\nthese men are stupid. They know only business. They do not know mankind\r\nnor society, and yet they set themselves up as arbiters of the fates of\r\nthe hungry millions and all the other millions thrown in. History, some\r\nday, will have an excruciating laugh at their expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not surprised when I had my talk out with Mrs. Wickson and Mrs.\r\nPertonwaithe. They were society women.[4] Their homes were palaces.\r\nThey had many homes scattered over the country, in the mountains, on\r\nlakes, and by the sea. They were tended by armies of servants, and\r\ntheir social activities were bewildering. They patronized the\r\nuniversity and the churches, and the pastors especially bowed at their\r\nknees in meek subservience.[5] They were powers, these two women, what\r\nof the money that was theirs. The power of subsidization of thought was\r\ntheirs to a remarkable degree, as I was soon to learn under Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntuition.\r\n\r\n [4] _Society_ is here used in a restricted sense, a common usage of\r\n the times to denote the gilded drones that did no labor, but only\r\n glutted themselves at the honey-vats of the workers. Neither the\r\n business men nor the laborers had time or opportunity for _society_.\r\n _Society_ was the creation of the idle rich who toiled not and who in\r\n this way played.\r\n\r\n [5] \xe2\x80\x9cBring on your tainted money,\xe2\x80\x9d was the expressed sentiment of the\r\n Church during this period.\r\n\r\nThey aped their husbands, and talked in the same large ways about\r\npolicy, and the duties and responsibilities of the rich. They were\r\nswayed by the same ethic that dominated their husbands\xe2\x80\x94the ethic of\r\ntheir class; and they uttered glib phrases that their own ears did not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAlso, they grew irritated when I told them of the deplorable condition\r\nof Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s family, and when I wondered that they had made no\r\nvoluntary provision for the man. I was told that they thanked no one\r\nfor instructing them in their social duties. When I asked them flatly\r\nto assist Jackson, they as flatly refused. The astounding thing about\r\nit was that they refused in almost identically the same language, and\r\nthis in face of the fact that I interviewed them separately and that\r\none did not know that I had seen or was going to see the other. Their\r\ncommon reply was that they were glad of the opportunity to make it\r\nperfectly plain that no premium would ever be put on carelessness by\r\nthem; nor would they, by paying for accident, tempt the poor to hurt\r\nthemselves in the machinery.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] In the files of the _Outlook_, a critical weekly of the period, in\r\n the number dated August 18, 1906, is related the circumstance of a\r\n workingman losing his arm, the details of which are quite similar to\r\n those of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case as related by Avis Everhard.\r\n\r\nAnd they were sincere, these two women. They were drunk with conviction\r\nof the superiority of their class and of themselves. They had a\r\nsanction, in their own class-ethic, for every act they performed. As I\r\ndrove away from Mrs. Pertonwaithe\xe2\x80\x99s great house, I looked back at it,\r\nand I remembered Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s expression that they were bound to the\r\nmachine, but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHE PHILOMATHS\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest was often at the house. Nor was it my father, merely, nor the\r\ncontroversial dinners, that drew him there. Even at that time I\r\nflattered myself that I played some part in causing his visits, and it\r\nwas not long before I learned the correctness of my surmise. For never\r\nwas there such a lover as Ernest Everhard. His gaze and his hand-clasp\r\ngrew firmer and steadier, if that were possible; and the question that\r\nhad grown from the first in his eyes, grew only the more imperative.\r\n\r\nMy impression of him, the first time I saw him, had been unfavorable.\r\nThen I had found myself attracted toward him. Next came my repulsion,\r\nwhen he so savagely attacked my class and me. After that, as I saw that\r\nhe had not maligned my class, and that the harsh and bitter things he\r\nsaid about it were justified, I had drawn closer to him again. He\r\nbecame my oracle. For me he tore the sham from the face of society and\r\ngave me glimpses of reality that were as unpleasant as they were\r\nundeniably true.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, there was never such a lover as he. No girl could live\r\nin a university town till she was twenty-four and not have love\r\nexperiences. I had been made love to by beardless sophomores and gray\r\nprofessors, and by the athletes and the football giants. But not one of\r\nthem made love to me as Ernest did. His arms were around me before I\r\nknew. His lips were on mine before I could protest or resist. Before\r\nhis earnestness conventional maiden dignity was ridiculous. He swept me\r\noff my feet by the splendid invincible rush of him. He did not propose.\r\nHe put his arms around me and kissed me and took it for granted that we\r\nshould be married. There was no discussion about it. The only\r\ndiscussion\xe2\x80\x94and that arose afterward\xe2\x80\x94was when we should be married.\r\n\r\nIt was unprecedented. It was unreal. Yet, in accordance with Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntest of truth, it worked. I trusted my life to it. And fortunate was\r\nthe trust. Yet during those first days of our love, fear of the future\r\ncame often to me when I thought of the violence and impetuosity of his\r\nlove-making. Yet such fears were groundless. No woman was ever blessed\r\nwith a gentler, tenderer husband. This gentleness and violence on his\r\npart was a curious blend similar to the one in his carriage of\r\nawkwardness and ease. That slight awkwardness! He never got over it,\r\nand it was delicious. His behavior in our drawing-room reminded me of a\r\ncareful bull in a china shop.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] In those days it was still the custom to fill the living rooms\r\n with bric-a-brac. They had not discovered simplicity of living. Such\r\n rooms were museums, entailing endless labor to keep clean. The\r\n dust-demon was the lord of the household. There were a myriad devices\r\n for catching dust, and only a few devices for getting rid of it.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that vanished my last doubt of the completeness of\r\nmy love for him (a subconscious doubt, at most). It was at the\r\nPhilomath Club\xe2\x80\x94a wonderful night of battle, wherein Ernest bearded the\r\nmasters in their lair. Now the Philomath Club was the most select on\r\nthe Pacific Coast. It was the creation of Miss Brentwood, an enormously\r\nwealthy old maid; and it was her husband, and family, and toy. Its\r\nmembers were the wealthiest in the community, and the strongest-minded\r\nof the wealthy, with, of course, a sprinkling of scholars to give it\r\nintellectual tone.\r\n\r\nThe Philomath had no club house. It was not that kind of a club. Once a\r\nmonth its members gathered at some one of their private houses to\r\nlisten to a lecture. The lecturers were usually, though not always,\r\nhired. If a chemist in New York made a new discovery in say radium, all\r\nhis expenses across the continent were paid, and as well he received a\r\nprincely fee for his time. The same with a returning explorer from the\r\npolar regions, or the latest literary or artistic success. No visitors\r\nwere allowed, while it was the Philomath\xe2\x80\x99s policy to permit none of its\r\ndiscussions to get into the papers. Thus great statesmen\xe2\x80\x94and there had\r\nbeen such occasions\xe2\x80\x94were able fully to speak their minds.\r\n\r\nI spread before me a wrinkled letter, written to me by Ernest twenty\r\nyears ago, and from it I copy the following:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father is a member of the Philomath, so you are able to come.\r\nTherefore come next Tuesday night. I promise you that you will have the\r\ntime of your life. In your recent encounters, you failed to shake the\r\nmasters. If you come, I\xe2\x80\x99ll shake them for you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make them snarl\r\nlike wolves. You merely questioned their morality. When their morality\r\nis questioned, they grow only the more complacent and superior. But I\r\nshall menace their money-bags. That will shake them to the roots of\r\ntheir primitive natures. If you can come, you will see the cave-man, in\r\nevening dress, snarling and snapping over a bone. I promise you a great\r\ncaterwauling and an illuminating insight into the nature of the beast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve invited me in order to tear me to pieces. This is the idea of\r\nMiss Brentwood. She clumsily hinted as much when she invited me. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiven them that kind of fun before. They delight in getting\r\ntrustful-souled gentle reformers before them. Miss Brentwood thinks I\r\nam as mild as a kitten and as good-natured and stolid as the family\r\ncow. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not deny that I helped to give her that impression. She was\r\nvery tentative at first, until she divined my harmlessness. I am to\r\nreceive a handsome fee\xe2\x80\x94two hundred and fifty dollars\xe2\x80\x94as befits the man\r\nwho, though a radical, once ran for governor. Also, I am to wear\r\nevening dress. This is compulsory. I never was so apparelled in my\r\nlife. I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to hire one somewhere. But I\xe2\x80\x99d do more than\r\nthat to get a chance at the Philomaths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf all places, the Club gathered that night at the Pertonwaithe house.\r\nExtra chairs had been brought into the great drawing-room, and in all\r\nthere must have been two hundred Philomaths that sat down to hear\r\nErnest. They were truly lords of society. I amused myself with running\r\nover in my mind the sum of the fortunes represented, and it ran well\r\ninto the hundreds of millions. And the possessors were not of the idle\r\nrich. They were men of affairs who took most active parts in industrial\r\nand political life.\r\n\r\nWe were all seated when Miss Brentwood brought Ernest in. They moved at\r\nonce to the head of the room, from where he was to speak. He was in\r\nevening dress, and, what of his broad shoulders and kingly head, he\r\nlooked magnificent. And then there was that faint and unmistakable\r\ntouch of awkwardness in his movements. I almost think I could have\r\nloved him for that alone. And as I looked at him I was aware of a great\r\njoy. I felt again the pulse of his palm on mine, the touch of his lips;\r\nand such pride was mine that I felt I must rise up and cry out to the\r\nassembled company: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is mine! He has held me in his arms, and I, mere\r\nI, have filled that mind of his to the exclusion of all his\r\nmultitudinous and kingly thoughts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the head of the room, Miss Brentwood introduced him to Colonel Van\r\nGilbert, and I knew that the latter was to preside. Colonel Van Gilbert\r\nwas a great corporation lawyer. In addition, he was immensely wealthy.\r\nThe smallest fee he would deign to notice was a hundred thousand\r\ndollars. He was a master of law. The law was a puppet with which he\r\nplayed. He moulded it like clay, twisted and distorted it like a\r\nChinese puzzle into any design he chose. In appearance and rhetoric he\r\nwas old-fashioned, but in imagination and knowledge and resource he was\r\nas young as the latest statute. His first prominence had come when he\r\nbroke the Shardwell will.[2] His fee for this one act was five hundred\r\nthousand dollars. From then on he had risen like a rocket. He was often\r\ncalled the greatest lawyer in the country\xe2\x80\x94corporation lawyer, of\r\ncourse; and no classification of the three greatest lawyers in the\r\nUnited States could have excluded him.\r\n\r\n [2] This breaking of wills was a peculiar feature of the period. With\r\n the accumulation of vast fortunes, the problem of disposing of these\r\n fortunes after death was a vexing one to the accumulators. Will-making\r\n and will-breaking became complementary trades, like armor-making and\r\n gun-making. The shrewdest will-making lawyers were called in to make\r\n wills that could not be broken. But these wills were always broken,\r\n and very often by the very lawyers that had drawn them up.\r\n Nevertheless the delusion persisted in the wealthy class that an\r\n absolutely unbreakable will could be cast; and so, through the\r\n generations, clients and lawyers pursued the illusion. It was a\r\n pursuit like unto that of the Universal Solvent of the medi\xc3\xa6val\r\n alchemists.\r\n\r\nHe arose and began, in a few well-chosen phrases that carried an\r\nundertone of faint irony, to introduce Ernest. Colonel Van Gilbert was\r\nsubtly facetious in his introduction of the social reformer and member\r\nof the working class, and the audience smiled. It made me angry, and I\r\nglanced at Ernest. The sight of him made me doubly angry. He did not\r\nseem to resent the delicate slurs. Worse than that, he did not seem to\r\nbe aware of them. There he sat, gentle, and stolid, and somnolent. He\r\nreally looked stupid. And for a moment the thought rose in my mind,\r\nWhat if he were overawed by this imposing array of power and brains?\r\nThen I smiled. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fool me. But he fooled the others, just as\r\nhe had fooled Miss Brentwood. She occupied a chair right up to the\r\nfront, and several times she turned her head toward one or another of\r\nher _confr\xc3\xa8res_ and smiled her appreciation of the remarks.\r\n\r\nColonel Van Gilbert done, Ernest arose and began to speak. He began in\r\na low voice, haltingly and modestly, and with an air of evident\r\nembarrassment. He spoke of his birth in the working class, and of the\r\nsordidness and wretchedness of his environment, where flesh and spirit\r\nwere alike starved and tormented. He described his ambitions and\r\nideals, and his conception of the paradise wherein lived the people of\r\nthe upper classes. As he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp above me, I knew, were unselfishnesses of the spirit, clean and\r\nnoble thinking, keen intellectual living. I knew all this because I\r\nread \xe2\x80\x98Seaside Library\xe2\x80\x99[3] novels, in which, with the exception of the\r\nvillains and adventuresses, all men and women thought beautiful\r\nthoughts, spoke a beautiful tongue, and performed glorious deeds. In\r\nshort, as I accepted the rising of the sun, I accepted that up above me\r\nwas all that was fine and noble and gracious, all that gave decency and\r\ndignity to life, all that made life worth living and that remunerated\r\none for his travail and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [3] A curious and amazing literature that served to make the working\r\n class utterly misapprehend the nature of the leisure class.\r\n\r\nHe went on and traced his life in the mills, the learning of the\r\nhorseshoeing trade, and his meeting with the socialists. Among them, he\r\nsaid, he had found keen intellects and brilliant wits, ministers of the\r\nGospel who had been broken because their Christianity was too wide for\r\nany congregation of mammon-worshippers, and professors who had been\r\nbroken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class. The\r\nsocialists were revolutionists, he said, struggling to overthrow the\r\nirrational society of the present and out of the material to build the\r\nrational society of the future. Much more he said that would take too\r\nlong to write, but I shall never forget how he described the life among\r\nthe revolutionists. All halting utterance vanished. His voice grew\r\nstrong and confident, and it glowed as he glowed, and as the thoughts\r\nglowed that poured out from him. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmongst the revolutionists I found, also, warm faith in the human,\r\nardent idealism, sweetnesses of unselfishness, renunciation, and\r\nmartyrdom\xe2\x80\x94all the splendid, stinging things of the spirit. Here life\r\nwas clean, noble, and alive. I was in touch with great souls who\r\nexalted flesh and spirit over dollars and cents, and to whom the thin\r\nwail of the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of commercial expansion and world empire. All about me\r\nwere nobleness of purpose and heroism of effort, and my days and nights\r\nwere sunshine and starshine, all fire and dew, with before my eyes,\r\never burning and blazing, the Holy Grail, Christ\xe2\x80\x99s own Grail, the warm\r\nhuman, long-suffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs before I had seen him transfigured, so now he stood transfigured\r\nbefore me. His brows were bright with the divine that was in him, and\r\nbrighter yet shone his eyes from the midst of the radiance that seemed\r\nto envelop him as a mantle. But the others did not see this radiance,\r\nand I assumed that it was due to the tears of joy and love that dimmed\r\nmy vision. At any rate, Mr. Wickson, who sat behind me, was unaffected,\r\nfor I heard him sneer aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cUtopian.\xe2\x80\x9d[4]\r\n\r\n [4] The people of that age were phrase slaves. The abjectness of their\r\n servitude is incomprehensible to us. There was a magic in words\r\n greater than the conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s art. So befuddled and chaotic were their\r\n minds that the utterance of a single word could negative the\r\n generalizations of a lifetime of serious research and thought. Such a\r\n word was the adjective _Utopian_. The mere utterance of it could damn\r\n any scheme, no matter how sanely conceived, of economic amelioration\r\n or regeneration. Vast populations grew frenzied over such phrases as\r\n \xe2\x80\x9can honest dollar\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca full dinner pail.\xe2\x80\x9d The coinage of such\r\n phrases was considered strokes of genius.\r\n\r\nErnest went on to his rise in society, till at last he came in touch\r\nwith members of the upper classes, and rubbed shoulders with the men\r\nwho sat in the high places. Then came his disillusionment, and this\r\ndisillusionment he described in terms that did not flatter his\r\naudience. He was surprised at the commonness of the clay. Life proved\r\nnot to be fine and gracious. He was appalled by the selfishness he\r\nencountered, and what had surprised him even more than that was the\r\nabsence of intellectual life. Fresh from his revolutionists, he was\r\nshocked by the intellectual stupidity of the master class. And then, in\r\nspite of their magnificent churches and well-paid preachers, he had\r\nfound the masters, men and women, grossly material. It was true that\r\nthey prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities, but in\r\nspite of their prattle the dominant key of the life they lived was\r\nmaterialistic. And they were without real morality\xe2\x80\x94for instance, that\r\nwhich Christ had preached but which was no longer preached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met men,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho invoked the name of the Prince of Peace in\r\ntheir diatribes against war, and who put rifles in the hands of\r\nPinkertons[5] with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories.\r\nI met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of\r\nprize-fighting, and who, at the same time, were parties to the\r\nadulteration of food that killed each year more babes than even\r\nred-handed Herod had killed.\r\n\r\n [5] Originally, they were private detectives; but they quickly became\r\n hired fighting men of the capitalists, and ultimately developed into\r\n the Mercenaries of the Oligarchy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis delicate, aristocratic-featured gentleman was a dummy director\r\nand a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans.\r\nThis gentleman, who collected fine editions and was a patron of\r\nliterature, paid blackmail to a heavy-jowled, black-browed boss of a\r\nmunicipal machine. This editor, who published patent medicine\r\nadvertisements, called me a scoundrelly demagogue because I dared him\r\nto print in his paper the truth about patent medicines.[6] This man,\r\ntalking soberly and earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the\r\ngoodness of God, had just betrayed his comrades in a business deal.\r\nThis man, a pillar of the church and heavy contributor to foreign\r\nmissions, worked his shop girls ten hours a day on a starvation wage\r\nand thereby directly encouraged prostitution. This man, who endowed\r\nchairs in universities and erected magnificent chapels, perjured\r\nhimself in courts of law over dollars and cents. This railroad magnate\r\nbroke his word as a citizen, as a gentleman, and as a Christian, when\r\nhe granted a secret rebate, and he granted many secret rebates. This\r\nsenator was the tool and the slave, the little puppet, of a brutal\r\nuneducated machine boss;[7] so was this governor and this supreme court\r\njudge; and all three rode on railroad passes; and, also, this sleek\r\ncapitalist owned the machine, the machine boss, and the railroads that\r\nissued the passes.\r\n\r\n [6] _Patent medicines_ were patent lies, but, like the charms and\r\n indulgences of the Middle Ages, they deceived the people. The only\r\n difference lay in that the patent medicines were more harmful and more\r\n costly.\r\n\r\n [7] Even as late as 1912, A.D., the great mass of the people still\r\n persisted in the belief that they ruled the country by virtue of their\r\n ballots. In reality, the country was ruled by what were called\r\n _political machines_. At first the machine bosses charged the master\r\n capitalists extortionate tolls for legislation; but in a short time\r\n the master capitalists found it cheaper to own the political machines\r\n themselves and to hire the machine bosses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it was, instead of in paradise, that I found myself in the arid\r\ndesert of commercialism. I found nothing but stupidity, except for\r\nbusiness. I found none clean, noble, and alive, though I found many who\r\nwere alive\xe2\x80\x94with rottenness. What I did find was monstrous selfishness\r\nand heartlessness, and a gross, gluttonous, practised, and practical\r\nmaterialism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.\r\nIntellectually they had bored him; morally and spiritually they had\r\nsickened him; so that he was glad to go back to his revolutionists, who\r\nwere clean, noble, and alive, and all that the capitalists were not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet me tell you about that revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut first I must say that his terrible diatribe had not touched them. I\r\nlooked about me at their faces and saw that they remained complacently\r\nsuperior to what he had charged. And I remembered what he had told me:\r\nthat no indictment of their morality could shake them. However, I could\r\nsee that the boldness of his language had affected Miss Brentwood. She\r\nwas looking worried and apprehensive.\r\n\r\nErnest began by describing the army of revolution, and as he gave the\r\nfigures of its strength (the votes cast in the various countries), the\r\nassemblage began to grow restless. Concern showed in their faces, and I\r\nnoticed a tightening of lips. At last the gage of battle had been\r\nthrown down. He described the international organization of the\r\nsocialists that united the million and a half in the United States with\r\nthe twenty-three millions and a half in the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch an army of revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-five millions strong, is\r\na thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider. The cry\r\nof this army is: \xe2\x80\x98No quarter! We want all that you possess. We will be\r\ncontent with nothing less than all that you possess. We want in our\r\nhands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind. Here are our\r\nhands. They are strong hands. We are going to take your governments,\r\nyour palaces, and all your purpled ease away from you, and in that day\r\nyou shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the\r\nstarved and runty clerk in your metropolises. Here are our hands. They\r\nare strong hands!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke he extended from his splendid shoulders his two great\r\narms, and the horseshoer\xe2\x80\x99s hands were clutching the air like eagle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalons. He was the spirit of regnant labor as he stood there, his hands\r\noutreaching to rend and crush his audience. I was aware of a faintly\r\nperceptible shrinking on the part of the listeners before this figure\r\nof revolution, concrete, potential, and menacing. That is, the women\r\nshrank, and fear was in their faces. Not so with the men. They were of\r\nthe active rich, and not the idle, and they were fighters. A low,\r\nthroaty rumble arose, lingered on the air a moment, and ceased. It was\r\nthe forerunner of the snarl, and I was to hear it many times that\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94the token of the brute in man, the earnest of his primitive\r\npassions. And they were unconscious that they had made this sound. It\r\nwas the growl of the pack, mouthed by the pack, and mouthed in all\r\nunconsciousness. And in that moment, as I saw the harshness form in\r\ntheir faces and saw the fight-light flashing in their eyes, I realized\r\nthat not easily would they let their lordship of the world be wrested\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nErnest proceeded with his attack. He accounted for the existence of the\r\nmillion and a half of revolutionists in the United States by charging\r\nthe capitalist class with having mismanaged society. He sketched the\r\neconomic condition of the cave-man and of the savage peoples of to-day,\r\npointing out that they possessed neither tools nor machines, and\r\npossessed only a natural efficiency of one in producing power. Then he\r\ntraced the development of machinery and social organization so that\r\nto-day the producing power of civilized man was a thousand times\r\ngreater than that of the savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive men,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ccan produce bread for a thousand. One man can\r\nproduce cotton cloth for two hundred and fifty people, woollens for\r\nthree hundred, and boots and shoes for a thousand. One would conclude\r\nfrom this that under a capable management of society modern civilized\r\nman would be a great deal better off than the cave-man. But is he? Let\r\nus see. In the United States to-day there are fifteen million[8] people\r\nliving in poverty; and by poverty is meant that condition in life in\r\nwhich, through lack of food and adequate shelter, the mere standard of\r\nworking efficiency cannot be maintained. In the United States to-day,\r\nin spite of all your so-called labor legislation, there are three\r\nmillions of child laborers.[9] In twelve years their numbers have been\r\ndoubled. And in passing I will ask you managers of society why you did\r\nnot make public the census figures of 1910? And I will answer for you,\r\nthat you were afraid. The figures of misery would have precipitated the\r\nrevolution that even now is gathering.\r\n\r\n [8] Robert Hunter, in 1906, in a book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPoverty,\xe2\x80\x9d pointed out\r\n that at that time there were ten millions in the United States living\r\n in poverty.\r\n\r\n [9] In the United States Census of 1900 (the last census the figures\r\n of which were made public), the number of child laborers was placed at\r\n 1,752,187.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to return to my indictment. If modern man\xe2\x80\x99s producing power is a\r\nthousand times greater than that of the cave-man, why then, in the\r\nUnited States to-day, are there fifteen million people who are not\r\nproperly sheltered and properly fed? Why then, in the United States\r\nto-day, are there three million child laborers? It is a true\r\nindictment. The capitalist class has mismanaged. In face of the facts\r\nthat modern man lives more wretchedly than the cave-man, and that his\r\nproducing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man,\r\nno other conclusion is possible than that the capitalist class has\r\nmismanaged, that you have mismanaged, my masters, that you have\r\ncriminally and selfishly mismanaged. And on this count you cannot\r\nanswer me here to-night, face to face, any more than can your whole\r\nclass answer the million and a half of revolutionists in the United\r\nStates. You cannot answer. I challenge you to answer. And furthermore,\r\nI dare to say to you now that when I have finished you will not answer.\r\nOn that point you will be tongue-tied, though you will talk wordily\r\nenough about other things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have failed in your management. You have made a shambles of\r\ncivilization. You have been blind and greedy. You have risen up (as you\r\nto-day rise up), shamelessly, in our legislative halls, and declared\r\nthat profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it. It is all in the records against you. You\r\nhave lulled your conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and\r\ndear moralities. You are fat with power and possession, drunken with\r\nsuccess; and you have no more hope against us than have the drones,\r\nclustered about the honey-vats, when the worker-bees spring upon them\r\nto end their rotund existence. You have failed in your management of\r\nsociety, and your management is to be taken away from you. A million\r\nand a half of the men of the working class say that they are going to\r\nget the rest of the working class to join with them and take the\r\nmanagement away from you. This is the revolution, my masters. Stop it\r\nif you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an appreciable lapse of time Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s voice continued to ring\r\nthrough the great room. Then arose the throaty rumble I had heard\r\nbefore, and a dozen men were on their feet clamoring for recognition\r\nfrom Colonel Van Gilbert. I noticed Miss Brentwood\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders moving\r\nconvulsively, and for the moment I was angry, for I thought that she\r\nwas laughing at Ernest. And then I discovered that it was not laughter,\r\nbut hysteria. She was appalled by what she had done in bringing this\r\nfirebrand before her blessed Philomath Club.\r\n\r\nColonel Van Gilbert did not notice the dozen men, with passion-wrought\r\nfaces, who strove to get permission from him to speak. His own face was\r\npassion-wrought. He sprang to his feet, waving his arms, and for a\r\nmoment could utter only incoherent sounds. Then speech poured from him.\r\nBut it was not the speech of a one-hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer, nor\r\nwas the rhetoric old-fashioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFallacy upon fallacy!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cNever in all my life have I heard so\r\nmany fallacies uttered in one short hour. And besides, young man, I\r\nmust tell you that you have said nothing new. I learned all that at\r\ncollege before you were born. Jean Jacques Rousseau enunciated your\r\nsocialistic theory nearly two centuries ago. A return to the soil,\r\nforsooth! Reversion! Our biology teaches the absurdity of it. It has\r\nbeen truly said that a little learning is a dangerous thing, and you\r\nhave exemplified it to-night with your madcap theories. Fallacy upon\r\nfallacy! I was never so nauseated in my life with overplus of fallacy.\r\nThat for your immature generalizations and childish reasonings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe snapped his fingers contemptuously and proceeded to sit down. There\r\nwere lip-exclamations of approval on the part of the women, and hoarser\r\nnotes of confirmation came from the men. As for the dozen men who were\r\nclamoring for the floor, half of them began speaking at once. The\r\nconfusion and babel was indescribable. Never had Mrs. Pertonwaithe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspacious walls beheld such a spectacle. These, then, were the cool\r\ncaptains of industry and lords of society, these snarling, growling\r\nsavages in evening clothes. Truly Ernest had shaken them when he\r\nstretched out his hands for their moneybags, his hands that had\r\nappeared in their eyes as the hands of the fifteen hundred thousand\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nBut Ernest never lost his head in a situation. Before Colonel Van\r\nGilbert had succeeded in sitting down, Ernest was on his feet and had\r\nsprung forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne at a time!\xe2\x80\x9d he roared at them.\r\n\r\nThe sound arose from his great lungs and dominated the human tempest.\r\nBy sheer compulsion of personality he commanded silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne at a time,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated softly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me answer Colonel Van\r\nGilbert. After that the rest of you can come at me\xe2\x80\x94but one at a time,\r\nremember. No mass-plays here. This is not a football field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, turning toward Colonel Van Gilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nreplied to nothing I have said. You have merely made a few excited and\r\ndogmatic assertions about my mental caliber. That may serve you in your\r\nbusiness, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me like that. I am not a workingman,\r\ncap in hand, asking you to increase my wages or to protect me from the\r\nmachine at which I work. You cannot be dogmatic with truth when you\r\ndeal with me. Save that for dealing with your wage-slaves. They will\r\nnot dare reply to you because you hold their bread and butter, their\r\nlives, in your hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for this return to nature that you say you learned at college\r\nbefore I was born, permit me to point out that on the face of it you\r\ncannot have learned anything since. Socialism has no more to do with\r\nthe state of nature than has differential calculus with a Bible class.\r\nI have called your class stupid when outside the realm of business.\r\nYou, sir, have brilliantly exemplified my statement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis terrible castigation of her hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer was too\r\nmuch for Miss Brentwood\xe2\x80\x99s nerves. Her hysteria became violent, and she\r\nwas helped, weeping and laughing, out of the room. It was just as well,\r\nfor there was worse to follow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest continued, when the interruption\r\nhad been led away. \xe2\x80\x9cYour own authorities with one unanimous voice will\r\nprove you stupid. Your own hired purveyors of knowledge will tell you\r\nthat you are wrong. Go to your meekest little assistant instructor of\r\nsociology and ask him what is the difference between Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s theory\r\nof the return to nature and the theory of socialism; ask your greatest\r\northodox bourgeois political economists and sociologists; question\r\nthrough the pages of every text-book written on the subject and stored\r\non the shelves of your subsidized libraries; and from one and all the\r\nanswer will be that there is nothing congruous between the return to\r\nnature and socialism. On the other hand, the unanimous affirmative\r\nanswer will be that the return to nature and socialism are\r\ndiametrically opposed to each other. As I say, don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for\r\nit. The record of your stupidity is there in the books, your own books\r\nthat you never read. And so far as your stupidity is concerned, you are\r\nbut the exemplar of your class.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know law and business, Colonel Van Gilbert. You know how to serve\r\ncorporations and increase dividends by twisting the law. Very good.\r\nStick to it. You are quite a figure. You are a very good lawyer, but\r\nyou are a poor historian, you know nothing of sociology, and your\r\nbiology is contemporaneous with Pliny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Colonel Van Gilbert writhed in his chair. There was perfect quiet\r\nin the room. Everybody sat fascinated\xe2\x80\x94paralyzed, I may say. Such\r\nfearful treatment of the great Colonel Van Gilbert was unheard of,\r\nundreamed of, impossible to believe\xe2\x80\x94the great Colonel Van Gilbert\r\nbefore whom judges trembled when he arose in court. But Ernest never\r\ngave quarter to an enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is, of course, no reflection on you,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery man to\r\nhis trade. Only you stick to your trade, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to mine. You\r\nhave specialized. When it comes to a knowledge of the law, of how best\r\nto evade the law or make new law for the benefit of thieving\r\ncorporations, I am down in the dirt at your feet. But when it comes to\r\nsociology\xe2\x80\x94my trade\xe2\x80\x94you are down in the dirt at my feet. Remember that.\r\nRemember, also, that your law is the stuff of a day, and that you are\r\nnot versatile in the stuff of more than a day. Therefore your dogmatic\r\nassertions and rash generalizations on things historical and\r\nsociological are not worth the breath you waste on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest paused for a moment and regarded him thoughtfully, noting his\r\nface dark and twisted with anger, his panting chest, his writhing body,\r\nand his slim white hands nervously clenching and unclenching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems you have breath to use, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a chance to use\r\nit. I indicted your class. Show me that my indictment is wrong. I\r\npointed out to you the wretchedness of modern man\xe2\x80\x94three million child\r\nslaves in the United States, without whose labor profits would not be\r\npossible, and fifteen million under-fed, ill-clothed, and worse-housed\r\npeople. I pointed out that modern man\xe2\x80\x99s producing power through social\r\norganization and the use of machinery was a thousand times greater than\r\nthat of the cave-man. And I stated that from these two facts no other\r\nconclusion was possible than that the capitalist class had mismanaged.\r\nThis was my indictment, and I specifically and at length challenged you\r\nto answer it. Nay, I did more. I prophesied that you would not answer.\r\nIt remains for your breath to smash my prophecy. You called my speech\r\nfallacy. Show the fallacy, Colonel Van Gilbert. Answer the indictment\r\nthat I and my fifteen hundred thousand comrades have brought against\r\nyour class and you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColonel Van Gilbert quite forgot that he was presiding, and that in\r\ncourtesy he should permit the other clamorers to speak. He was on his\r\nfeet, flinging his arms, his rhetoric, and his control to the winds,\r\nalternately abusing Ernest for his youth and demagoguery, and savagely\r\nattacking the working class, elaborating its inefficiency and\r\nworthlessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a lawyer, you are the hardest man to keep to a point I ever saw,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nErnest began his answer to the tirade. \xe2\x80\x9cMy youth has nothing to do with\r\nwhat I have enunciated. Nor has the worthlessness of the working class.\r\nI charged the capitalist class with having mismanaged society. You have\r\nnot answered. You have made no attempt to answer. Why? Is it because\r\nyou have no answer? You are the champion of this whole audience. Every\r\none here, except me, is hanging on your lips for that answer. They are\r\nhanging on your lips for that answer because they have no answer\r\nthemselves. As for me, as I said before, I know that you not only\r\ncannot answer, but that you will not attempt an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d Colonel Van Gilbert cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is insult!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you should not answer is intolerable,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo man can be intellectually insulted. Insult, in its very nature, is\r\nemotional. Recover yourself. Give me an intellectual answer to my\r\nintellectual charge that the capitalist class has mismanaged society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColonel Van Gilbert remained silent, a sullen, superior expression on\r\nhis face, such as will appear on the face of a man who will not bandy\r\nwords with a ruffian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be downcast,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cTake consolation in the fact that\r\nno member of your class has ever yet answered that charge.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\r\nto the other men who were anxious to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now it\xe2\x80\x99s your chance.\r\nFire away, and do not forget that I here challenge you to give the\r\nanswer that Colonel Van Gilbert has failed to give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible for me to write all that was said in the\r\ndiscussion. I never realized before how many words could be spoken in\r\nthree short hours. At any rate, it was glorious. The more his opponents\r\ngrew excited, the more Ernest deliberately excited them. He had an\r\nencyclopaedic command of the field of knowledge, and by a word or a\r\nphrase, by delicate rapier thrusts, he punctured them. He named the\r\npoints of their illogic. This was a false syllogism, that conclusion\r\nhad no connection with the premise, while that next premise was an\r\nimpostor because it had cunningly hidden in it the conclusion that was\r\nbeing attempted to be proved. This was an error, that was an\r\nassumption, and the next was an assertion contrary to ascertained truth\r\nas printed in all the text-books.\r\n\r\nAnd so it went. Sometimes he exchanged the rapier for the club and went\r\nsmashing amongst their thoughts right and left. And always he demanded\r\nfacts and refused to discuss theories. And his facts made for them a\r\nWaterloo. When they attacked the working class, he always retorted,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pot calling the kettle black; that is no answer to the charge that\r\nyour own face is dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d And to one and all he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you not\r\nanswered the charge that your class has mismanaged? You have talked\r\nabout other things and things concerning other things, but you have not\r\nanswered. Is it because you have no answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of the discussion that Mr. Wickson spoke. He was the\r\nonly one that was cool, and Ernest treated him with a respect he had\r\nnot accorded the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo answer is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wickson said with slow deliberation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave followed the whole discussion with amazement and disgust. I am\r\ndisgusted with you gentlemen, members of my class. You have behaved\r\nlike foolish little schoolboys, what with intruding ethics and the\r\nthunder of the common politician into such a discussion. You have been\r\noutgeneralled and outclassed. You have been very wordy, and all you\r\nhave done is buzz. You have buzzed like gnats about a bear. Gentlemen,\r\nthere stands the bear\xe2\x80\x9d (he pointed at Ernest), \xe2\x80\x9cand your buzzing has\r\nonly tickled his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, the situation is serious. That bear reached out his paws\r\ntonight to crush us. He has said there are a million and a half of\r\nrevolutionists in the United States. That is a fact. He has said that\r\nit is their intention to take away from us our governments, our\r\npalaces, and all our purpled ease. That, also, is a fact. A change, a\r\ngreat change, is coming in society; but, haply, it may not be the\r\nchange the bear anticipates. The bear has said that he will crush us.\r\nWhat if we crush the bear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe throat-rumble arose in the great room, and man nodded to man with\r\nindorsement and certitude. Their faces were set hard. They were\r\nfighters, that was certain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not by buzzing will we crush the bear,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wickson went on coldly\r\nand dispassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will hunt the bear. We will not reply to the\r\nbear in words. Our reply shall be couched in terms of lead. We are in\r\npower. Nobody will deny it. By virtue of that power we shall remain in\r\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly upon Ernest. The moment was dramatic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, then, is our answer. We have no words to waste on you. When you\r\nreach out your vaunted strong hands for our palaces and purpled ease,\r\nwe will show you what strength is. In roar of shell and shrapnel and in\r\nwhine of machine-guns will our answer be couched.[10] We will grind you\r\nrevolutionists down under our heel, and we shall walk upon your faces.\r\nThe world is ours, we are its lords, and ours it shall remain. As for\r\nthe host of labor, it has been in the dirt since history began, and I\r\nread history aright. And in the dirt it shall remain so long as I and\r\nmine and those that come after us have the power. There is the word. It\r\nis the king of words\xe2\x80\x94Power. Not God, not Mammon, but Power. Pour it\r\nover your tongue till it tingles with it. Power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [10] To show the tenor of thought, the following definition is quoted\r\n from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cynic\xe2\x80\x99s Word Book\xe2\x80\x9d (1906 A.D.), written by one Ambrose\r\n Bierce, an avowed and confirmed misanthrope of the period: \xe2\x80\x9cGrapeshot,\r\n _n. An argument which the future is preparing in answer to the demands\r\n of American Socialism._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am answered,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only answer that could\r\nbe given. Power. It is what we of the working class preach. We know,\r\nand well we know by bitter experience, that no appeal for the right,\r\nfor justice, for humanity, can ever touch you. Your hearts are hard as\r\nyour heels with which you tread upon the faces of the poor. So we have\r\npreached power. By the power of our ballots on election day will we\r\ntake your government away from you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if you do get a majority, a sweeping majority, on election day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Wickson broke in to demand. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we refuse to turn the\r\ngovernment over to you after you have captured it at the ballot-box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, also, have we considered,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we shall give\r\nyou an answer in terms of lead. Power you have proclaimed the king of\r\nwords. Very good. Power it shall be. And in the day that we sweep to\r\nvictory at the ballot-box, and you refuse to turn over to us the\r\ngovernment we have constitutionally and peacefully captured, and you\r\ndemand what we are going to do about it\xe2\x80\x94in that day, I say, we shall\r\nanswer you; and in roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of\r\nmachine-guns shall our answer be couched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot escape us. It is true that you have read history aright. It\r\nis true that labor has from the beginning of history been in the dirt.\r\nAnd it is equally true that so long as you and yours and those that\r\ncome after you have power, that labor shall remain in the dirt. I agree\r\nwith you. I agree with all that you have said. Power will be the\r\narbiter, as it always has been the arbiter. It is a struggle of\r\nclasses. Just as your class dragged down the old feudal nobility, so\r\nshall it be dragged down by my class, the working class. If you will\r\nread your biology and your sociology as clearly as you do your history,\r\nyou will see that this end I have described is inevitable. It does not\r\nmatter whether it is in one year, ten, or a thousand\xe2\x80\x94your class shall\r\nbe dragged down. And it shall be done by power. We of the labor hosts\r\nhave conned that word over till our minds are all a-tingle with it.\r\nPower. It is a kingly word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so ended the night with the Philomaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nADUMBRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the warnings of coming events began to fall\r\nabout us thick and fast. Ernest had already questioned father\xe2\x80\x99s policy\r\nof having socialists and labor leaders at his house, and of openly\r\nattending socialist meetings; and father had only laughed at him for\r\nhis pains. As for myself, I was learning much from this contact with\r\nthe working-class leaders and thinkers. I was seeing the other side of\r\nthe shield. I was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism I\r\nencountered, though I was appalled by the vast philosophic and\r\nscientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me. I was\r\nlearning fast, but I learned not fast enough to realize then the peril\r\nof our position.\r\n\r\nThere were warnings, but I did not heed them. For instance, Mrs.\r\nPertonwaithe and Mrs. Wickson exercised tremendous social power in the\r\nuniversity town, and from them emanated the sentiment that I was a\r\ntoo-forward and self-assertive young woman with a mischievous penchant\r\nfor officiousness and interference in other persons\xe2\x80\x99 affairs. This I\r\nthought no more than natural, considering the part I had played in\r\ninvestigating the case of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s arm. But the effect of such a\r\nsentiment, enunciated by two such powerful social arbiters, I\r\nunderestimated.\r\n\r\nTrue, I noticed a certain aloofness on the part of my general friends,\r\nbut this I ascribed to the disapproval that was prevalent in my circles\r\nof my intended marriage with Ernest. It was not till some time\r\nafterward that Ernest pointed out to me clearly that this general\r\nattitude of my class was something more than spontaneous, that behind\r\nit were the hidden springs of an organized conduct. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have given\r\nshelter to an enemy of your class,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd not alone shelter,\r\nfor you have given your love, yourself. This is treason to your class.\r\nThink not that you will escape being penalized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was before this that father returned one afternoon. Ernest was\r\nwith me, and we could see that father was angry\xe2\x80\x94philosophically angry.\r\nHe was rarely really angry; but a certain measure of controlled anger\r\nhe allowed himself. He called it a tonic. And we could see that he was\r\ntonic-angry when he entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI had luncheon with Wilcox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilcox was the superannuated president of the university, whose\r\nwithered mind was stored with generalizations that were young in 1870,\r\nand which he had since failed to revise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was invited,\xe2\x80\x9d father announced. \xe2\x80\x9cI was sent for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and we waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was done very nicely, I\xe2\x80\x99ll allow; but I was reprimanded. I! And\r\nby that old fossil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wager I know what you were reprimanded for,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in three guesses,\xe2\x80\x9d father laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne guess will do,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a guess. It will\r\nbe a deduction. You were reprimanded for your private life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing!\xe2\x80\x9d father cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you guess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it was coming. I warned you before about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did,\xe2\x80\x9d father meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. At any\r\nrate, it is only so much more clinching evidence for my book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing to what will come,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif you persist in\r\nyour policy of having these socialists and radicals of all sorts at\r\nyour house, myself included.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what old Wilcox said. And of all unwarranted things! He said it\r\nwas in poor taste, utterly profitless, anyway, and not in harmony with\r\nuniversity traditions and policy. He said much more of the same vague\r\nsort, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pin him down to anything specific. I made it\r\npretty awkward for him, and he could only go on repeating himself and\r\ntelling me how much he honored me, and all the world honored me, as a\r\nscientist. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an agreeable task for him. I could see he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not a free agent,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe leg-bar[1] is not always\r\nworn graciously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] _Leg-bar_\xe2\x80\x94the African slaves were so manacled; also criminals. It\r\n was not until the coming of the Brotherhood of Man that the leg-bar\r\n passed out of use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I got that much out of him. He said the university needed ever so\r\nmuch more money this year than the state was willing to furnish; and\r\nthat it must come from wealthy personages who could not but be offended\r\nby the swerving of the university from its high ideal of the\r\npassionless pursuit of passionless intelligence. When I tried to pin\r\nhim down to what my home life had to do with swerving the university\r\nfrom its high ideal, he offered me a two years\xe2\x80\x99 vacation, on full pay,\r\nin Europe, for recreation and research. Of course I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept it\r\nunder the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been far better if you had,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a bribe,\xe2\x80\x9d father protested; and Ernest nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, the beggar said that there was talk, tea-table gossip and so\r\nforth, about my daughter being seen in public with so notorious a\r\ncharacter as you, and that it was not in keeping with university tone\r\nand dignity. Not that he personally objected\xe2\x80\x94oh, no; but that there was\r\ntalk and that I would understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest considered this announcement for a moment, and then said, and\r\nhis face was very grave, withal there was a sombre wrath in it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is more behind this than a mere university ideal. Somebody has\r\nput pressure on President Wilcox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d father asked, and his face showed that he was\r\ninterested rather than frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could convey to you the conception that is dimly forming in\r\nmy own mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cNever in the history of the world was\r\nsociety in so terrific flux as it is right now. The swift changes in\r\nour industrial system are causing equally swift changes in our\r\nreligious, political, and social structures. An unseen and fearful\r\nrevolution is taking place in the fibre and structure of society. One\r\ncan only dimly feel these things. But they are in the air, now, to-day.\r\nOne can feel the loom of them\xe2\x80\x94things vast, vague, and terrible. My mind\r\nrecoils from contemplation of what they may crystallize into. You heard\r\nWickson talk the other night. Behind what he said were the same\r\nnameless, formless things that I feel. He spoke out of a superconscious\r\napprehension of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean . . . ?\xe2\x80\x9d father began, then paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that there is a shadow of something colossal and menacing that\r\neven now is beginning to fall across the land. Call it the shadow of an\r\noligarchy, if you will; it is the nearest I dare approximate it. What\r\nits nature may be I refuse to imagine.[2] But what I wanted to say was\r\nthis: You are in a perilous position\xe2\x80\x94a peril that my own fear enhances\r\nbecause I am not able even to measure it. Take my advice and accept the\r\nvacation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [2] Though, like Everhard, they did not dream of the nature of it,\r\n there were men, even before his time, who caught glimpses of the\r\n shadow. John C. Calhoun said: \xe2\x80\x9c_A power has risen up in the government\r\n greater than the people themselves, consisting of many and various and\r\n powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the\r\n cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks_.\xe2\x80\x9d And that great\r\n humanist, Abraham Lincoln, said, just before his assassination: \xe2\x80\x9c_I\r\n see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and\r\n causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . . Corporations\r\n have been enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow,\r\n and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign\r\n by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is\r\n aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it would be cowardly,\xe2\x80\x9d was the protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. You are an old man. You have done your work in the world,\r\nand a great work. Leave the present battle to youth and strength. We\r\nyoung fellows have our work yet to do. Avis will stand by my side in\r\nwhat is to come. She will be your representative in the battle-front.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me,\xe2\x80\x9d father objected. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God I am independent.\r\nOh, I assure you, I know the frightful persecution they can wage on a\r\nprofessor who is economically dependent on his university. But I am\r\nindependent. I have not been a professor for the sake of my salary. I\r\ncan get along very comfortably on my own income, and the salary is all\r\nthey can take away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not realize,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all that I fear be so,\r\nyour private income, your principal itself, can be taken from you just\r\nas easily as your salary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather was silent for a few minutes. He was thinking deeply, and I\r\ncould see the lines of decision forming in his face. At last he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not take the vacation.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused again. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go on with\r\nmy book.[3] You may be wrong, but whether you are wrong or right, I\r\nshall stand by my guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [3] This book, \xe2\x80\x9cEconomics and Education,\xe2\x80\x9d was published in that year.\r\n Three copies of it are extant; two at Ardis, and one at Asgard. It\r\n dealt, in elaborate detail, with one factor in the persistence of the\r\n established, namely, the capitalistic bias of the universities and\r\n common schools. It was a logical and crushing indictment of the whole\r\n system of education that developed in the minds of the students only\r\n such ideas as were favorable to the capitalistic regime, to the\r\n exclusion of all ideas that were inimical and subversive. The book\r\n created a furor, and was promptly suppressed by the Oligarchy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are travelling the same path that Bishop\r\nMorehouse is, and toward a similar smash-up. You\xe2\x80\x99ll both be\r\nproletarians before you\xe2\x80\x99re done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned upon the Bishop, and we got Ernest to explain\r\nwhat he had been doing with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is soul-sick from the journey through hell I have given him. I took\r\nhim through the homes of a few of our factory workers. I showed him the\r\nhuman wrecks cast aside by the industrial machine, and he listened to\r\ntheir life stories. I took him through the slums of San Francisco, and\r\nin drunkenness, prostitution, and criminality he learned a deeper cause\r\nthan innate depravity. He is very sick, and, worse than that, he has\r\ngot out of hand. He is too ethical. He has been too severely touched.\r\nAnd, as usual, he is unpractical. He is up in the air with all kinds of\r\nethical delusions and plans for mission work among the cultured. He\r\nfeels it is his bounden duty to resurrect the ancient spirit of the\r\nChurch and to deliver its message to the masters. He is overwrought.\r\nSooner or later he is going to break out, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\r\na smash-up. What form it will take I can\xe2\x80\x99t even guess. He is a pure,\r\nexalted soul, but he is so unpractical. He\xe2\x80\x99s beyond me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nhis feet on the earth. And through the air he is rushing on to his\r\nGethsemane. And after this his crucifixion. Such high souls are made\r\nfor crucifixion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked; and beneath my smile was the seriousness of the\r\nanxiety of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed back. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be executed, or assassinated, but I\r\nshall never be crucified. I am planted too solidly and stolidly upon\r\nthe earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you bring about the crucifixion of the Bishop?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not deny that you are the cause of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I leave one comfortable soul in comfort when there are\r\nmillions in travail and misery?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you advise father to accept the vacation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am not a pure, exalted soul,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am\r\nsolid and stolid and selfish. Because I love you and, like Ruth of old,\r\nthy people are my people. As for the Bishop, he has no daughter.\r\nBesides, no matter how small the good, nevertheless his little\r\ninadequate wail will be productive of some good in the revolution, and\r\nevery little bit counts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not agree with Ernest. I knew well the noble nature of Bishop\r\nMorehouse, and I could not conceive that his voice raised for\r\nrighteousness would be no more than a little inadequate wail. But I did\r\nnot yet have the harsh facts of life at my fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends as Ernest had.\r\nHe saw clearly the futility of the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s great soul, as coming\r\nevents were soon to show as clearly to me.\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after this day that Ernest told me, as a good story, the\r\noffer he had received from the government, namely, an appointment as\r\nUnited States Commissioner of Labor. I was overjoyed. The salary was\r\ncomparatively large, and would make safe our marriage. And then it\r\nsurely was congenial work for Ernest, and, furthermore, my jealous\r\npride in him made me hail the proffered appointment as a recognition of\r\nhis abilities.\r\n\r\nThen I noticed the twinkle in his eyes. He was laughing at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going to . . . to decline?\xe2\x80\x9d I quavered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a bribe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBehind it is the fine hand of Wickson, and\r\nbehind him the hands of greater men than he. It is an old trick, old as\r\nthe class struggle is old\xe2\x80\x94stealing the captains from the army of labor.\r\nPoor betrayed labor! If you but knew how many of its leaders have been\r\nbought out in similar ways in the past. It is cheaper, so much cheaper,\r\nto buy a general than to fight him and his whole army. There was\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not call any names. I\xe2\x80\x99m bitter enough over it as it is. Dear\r\nheart, I am a captain of labor. I could not sell out. If for no other\r\nreason, the memory of my poor old father and the way he was worked to\r\ndeath would prevent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears were in his eyes, this great, strong hero of mine. He never\r\ncould forgive the way his father had been malformed\xe2\x80\x94the sordid lies and\r\nthe petty thefts he had been compelled to, in order to put food in his\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s mouths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was a good man,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest once said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe soul of him\r\nwas good, and yet it was twisted, and maimed, and blunted by the\r\nsavagery of his life. He was made into a broken-down beast by his\r\nmasters, the arch-beasts. He should be alive to-day, like your father.\r\nHe had a strong constitution. But he was caught in the machine and\r\nworked to death\xe2\x80\x94for profit. Think of it. For profit\xe2\x80\x94his life blood\r\ntransmuted into a wine-supper, or a jewelled gewgaw, or some similar\r\nsense-orgy of the parasitic and idle rich, his masters, the\r\narch-beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE BISHOP\xe2\x80\x99S VISION\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bishop is out of hand,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest wrote me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is clear up in the\r\nair. Tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very miserable\r\nworld of ours. He is going to deliver his message. He has told me so,\r\nand I cannot dissuade him. To-night he is chairman of the I.P.H.,[1]\r\nand he will embody his message in his introductory remarks.\r\n\r\n [1] There is no clew to the name of the organization for which these\r\n initials stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I bring you to hear him? Of course, he is foredoomed to futility.\r\nIt will break your heart\xe2\x80\x94it will break his; but for you it will be an\r\nexcellent object lesson. You know, dear heart, how proud I am because\r\nyou love me. And because of that I want you to know my fullest value, I\r\nwant to redeem, in your eyes, some small measure of my unworthiness.\r\nAnd so it is that my pride desires that you shall know my thinking is\r\ncorrect and right. My views are harsh; the futility of so noble a soul\r\nas the Bishop will show you the compulsion for such harshness. So come\r\nto-night. Sad though this night\xe2\x80\x99s happening will be, I feel that it\r\nwill but draw you more closely to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe I.P.H. held its convention that night in San Francisco.[2] This\r\nconvention had been called to consider public immorality and the remedy\r\nfor it. Bishop Morehouse presided. He was very nervous as he sat on the\r\nplatform, and I could see the high tension he was under. By his side\r\nwere Bishop Dickinson; H. H. Jones, the head of the ethical department\r\nin the University of California; Mrs. W. W. Hurd, the great charity\r\norganizer; Philip Ward, the equally great philanthropist; and several\r\nlesser luminaries in the field of morality and charity. Bishop\r\nMorehouse arose and abruptly began:\r\n\r\n [2] It took but a few minutes to cross by ferry from Berkeley to San\r\n Francisco. These, and the other bay cities, practically composed one\r\n community.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in my brougham, driving through the streets. It was night-time.\r\nNow and then I looked through the carriage windows, and suddenly my\r\neyes seemed to be opened, and I saw things as they really are. At first\r\nI covered my eyes with my hands to shut out the awful sight, and then,\r\nin the darkness, the question came to me: What is to be done? What is\r\nto be done? A little later the question came to me in another way: What\r\nwould the Master do? And with the question a great light seemed to fill\r\nthe place, and I saw my duty sun-clear, as Saul saw his on the way to\r\nDamascus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stopped the carriage, got out, and, after a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconversation, persuaded two of the public women to get into the\r\nbrougham with me. If Jesus was right, then these two unfortunates were\r\nmy sisters, and the only hope of their purification was in my affection\r\nand tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live in one of the loveliest localities of San Francisco. The house\r\nin which I live cost a hundred thousand dollars, and its furnishings,\r\nbooks, and works of art cost as much more. The house is a mansion. No,\r\nit is a palace, wherein there are many servants. I never knew what\r\npalaces were good for. I had thought they were to live in. But now I\r\nknow. I took the two women of the street to my palace, and they are\r\ngoing to stay with me. I hope to fill every room in my palace with such\r\nsisters as they.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe audience had been growing more and more restless and unsettled, and\r\nthe faces of those that sat on the platform had been betraying greater\r\nand greater dismay and consternation. And at this point Bishop\r\nDickinson arose, and with an expression of disgust on his face, fled\r\nfrom the platform and the hall. But Bishop Morehouse, oblivious to all,\r\nhis eyes filled with his vision, continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sisters and brothers, in this act of mine I find the solution of\r\nall my difficulties. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what broughams were made for, but\r\nnow I know. They are made to carry the weak, the sick, and the aged;\r\nthey are made to show honor to those who have lost the sense even of\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know what palaces were made for, but now I have found a use\r\nfor them. The palaces of the Church should be hospitals and nurseries\r\nfor those who have fallen by the wayside and are perishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a long pause, plainly overcome by the thought that was in him,\r\nand nervous how best to express it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not fit, dear brethren, to tell you anything about morality. I\r\nhave lived in shame and hypocrisies too long to be able to help others;\r\nbut my action with those women, sisters of mine, shows me that the\r\nbetter way is easy to find. To those who believe in Jesus and his\r\ngospel there can be no other relation between man and man than the\r\nrelation of affection. Love alone is stronger than sin\xe2\x80\x94stronger than\r\ndeath. I therefore say to the rich among you that it is their duty to\r\ndo what I have done and am doing. Let each one of you who is prosperous\r\ntake into his house some thief and treat him as his brother, some\r\nunfortunate and treat her as his sister, and San Francisco will need no\r\npolice force and no magistrates; the prisons will be turned into\r\nhospitals, and the criminal will disappear with his crime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must give ourselves and not our money alone. We must do as Christ\r\ndid; that is the message of the Church today. We have wandered far from\r\nthe Master\xe2\x80\x99s teaching. We are consumed in our own flesh-pots. We have\r\nput mammon in the place of Christ. I have here a poem that tells the\r\nwhole story. I should like to read it to you. It was written by an\r\nerring soul who yet saw clearly.[3] It must not be mistaken for an\r\nattack upon the Catholic Church. It is an attack upon all churches,\r\nupon the pomp and splendor of all churches that have wandered from the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s path and hedged themselves in from his lambs. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe silver trumpets rang across the Dome;\r\n    The people knelt upon the ground with awe;\r\n    And borne upon the necks of men I saw,\r\nLike some great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPriest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,\r\n    And, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,\r\n    Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head;\r\nIn splendor and in light the Pope passed home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy heart stole back across wide wastes of years\r\n    To One who wandered by a lonely sea;\r\nAnd sought in vain for any place of rest:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Foxes have holes, and every bird its nest,\r\n    I, only I, must wander wearily,\r\nAnd bruise my feet, and drink wine salt with tears.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [3] Oscar Wilde, one of the lords of language of the nineteenth\r\n century of the Christian Era.\r\n\r\nThe audience was agitated, but unresponsive. Yet Bishop Morehouse was\r\nnot aware of it. He held steadily on his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I say to the rich among you, and to all the rich, that bitterly\r\nyou oppress the Master\xe2\x80\x99s lambs. You have hardened your hearts. You have\r\nclosed your ears to the voices that are crying in the land\xe2\x80\x94the voices\r\nof pain and sorrow that you will not hear but that some day will be\r\nheard. And so I say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at this point H. H. Jones and Philip Ward, who had already risen\r\nfrom their chairs, led the Bishop off the platform, while the audience\r\nsat breathless and shocked.\r\n\r\nErnest laughed harshly and savagely when he had gained the street. His\r\nlaughter jarred upon me. My heart seemed ready to burst with suppressed\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has delivered his message,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThe manhood and the\r\ndeep-hidden, tender nature of their Bishop burst out, and his Christian\r\naudience, that loved him, concluded that he was crazy! Did you see them\r\nleading him so solicitously from the platform? There must have been\r\nlaughter in hell at the spectacle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, it will make a great impression, what the Bishop did and\r\nsaid to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink so?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest queried mockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will make a sensation,\xe2\x80\x9d I asserted. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you see the reporters\r\nscribbling like mad while he was speaking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a line of which will appear in to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust wait and see,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a line, not a thought that he\r\nuttered. The daily press? The daily suppressage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the reporters,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word that he uttered will see print. You have forgotten the\r\neditors. They draw their salaries for the policy they maintain. Their\r\npolicy is to print nothing that is a vital menace to the established.\r\nThe Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s utterance was a violent assault upon the established\r\nmorality. It was heresy. They led him from the platform to prevent him\r\nfrom uttering more heresy. The newspapers will purge his heresy in the\r\noblivion of silence. The press of the United States? It is a parasitic\r\ngrowth that battens on the capitalist class. Its function is to serve\r\nthe established by moulding public opinion, and right well it serves\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me prophesy. To-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s papers will merely mention that the\r\nBishop is in poor health, that he has been working too hard, and that\r\nhe broke down last night. The next mention, some days hence, will be to\r\nthe effect that he is suffering from nervous prostration and has been\r\ngiven a vacation by his grateful flock. After that, one of two things\r\nwill happen: either the Bishop will see the error of his way and return\r\nfrom his vacation a well man in whose eyes there are no more visions,\r\nor else he will persist in his madness, and then you may expect to see\r\nin the papers, couched pathetically and tenderly, the announcement of\r\nhis insanity. After that he will be left to gibber his visions to\r\npadded walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow there you go too far!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the eyes of society it will truly be insanity,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhonest man, who is not insane, would take lost women and thieves into\r\nhis house to dwell with him sisterly and brotherly? True, Christ died\r\nbetween two thieves, but that is another story. Insanity? The mental\r\nprocesses of the man with whom one disagrees, are always wrong.\r\nTherefore the mind of the man is wrong. Where is the line between wrong\r\nmind and insane mind? It is inconceivable that any sane man can\r\nradically disagree with one\xe2\x80\x99s most sane conclusions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a good example of it in this evening\xe2\x80\x99s paper. Mary McKenna\r\nlives south of Market Street. She is a poor but honest woman. She is\r\nalso patriotic. But she has erroneous ideas concerning the American\r\nflag and the protection it is supposed to symbolize. And here\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nhappened to her. Her husband had an accident and was laid up in\r\nhospital three months. In spite of taking in washing, she got behind in\r\nher rent. Yesterday they evicted her. But first, she hoisted an\r\nAmerican flag, and from under its folds she announced that by virtue of\r\nits protection they could not turn her out on to the cold street. What\r\nwas done? She was arrested and arraigned for insanity. To-day she was\r\nexamined by the regular insanity experts. She was found insane. She was\r\nconsigned to the Napa Asylum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is far-fetched,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I should disagree with\r\neverybody about the literary style of a book. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send me to\r\nan asylum for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut such divergence of opinion would\r\nconstitute no menace to society. Therein lies the difference. The\r\ndivergence of opinion on the parts of Mary McKenna and the Bishop do\r\nmenace society. What if all the poor people should refuse to pay rent\r\nand shelter themselves under the American flag? Landlordism would go\r\ncrumbling. The Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s views are just as perilous to society. Ergo, to\r\nthe asylum with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut still I refused to believe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait and see,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said, and I waited.\r\n\r\nNext morning I sent out for all the papers. So far Ernest was right.\r\nNot a word that Bishop Morehouse had uttered was in print. Mention was\r\nmade in one or two of the papers that he had been overcome by his\r\nfeelings. Yet the platitudes of the speakers that followed him were\r\nreported at length.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later the brief announcement was made that he had gone\r\naway on a vacation to recover from the effects of overwork. So far so\r\ngood, but there had been no hint of insanity, nor even of nervous\r\ncollapse. Little did I dream the terrible road the Bishop was destined\r\nto travel\xe2\x80\x94the Gethsemane and crucifixion that Ernest had pondered\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE MACHINE BREAKERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just before Ernest ran for Congress, on the socialist ticket,\r\nthat father gave what he privately called his \xe2\x80\x9cProfit and Loss\xe2\x80\x9d dinner.\r\nErnest called it the dinner of the Machine Breakers. In point of fact,\r\nit was merely a dinner for business men\xe2\x80\x94small business men, of course.\r\nI doubt if one of them was interested in any business the total\r\ncapitalization of which exceeded a couple of hundred thousand dollars.\r\nThey were truly representative middle-class business men.\r\n\r\nThere was Owen, of Silverberg, Owen & Company\xe2\x80\x94a large grocery firm with\r\nseveral branch stores. We bought our groceries from them. There were\r\nboth partners of the big drug firm of Kowalt & Washburn, and Mr.\r\nAsmunsen, the owner of a large granite quarry in Contra Costa County.\r\nAnd there were many similar men, owners or part-owners in small\r\nfactories, small businesses and small industries\xe2\x80\x94small capitalists, in\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nThey were shrewd-faced, interesting men, and they talked with\r\nsimplicity and clearness. Their unanimous complaint was against the\r\ncorporations and trusts. Their creed was, \xe2\x80\x9cBust the Trusts.\xe2\x80\x9d All\r\noppression originated in the trusts, and one and all told the same tale\r\nof woe. They advocated government ownership of such trusts as the\r\nrailroads and telegraphs, and excessive income taxes, graduated with\r\nferocity, to destroy large accumulations. Likewise they advocated, as a\r\ncure for local ills, municipal ownership of such public utilities as\r\nwater, gas, telephones, and street railways.\r\n\r\nEspecially interesting was Mr. Asmunsen\xe2\x80\x99s narrative of his tribulations\r\nas a quarry owner. He confessed that he never made any profits out of\r\nhis quarry, and this, in spite of the enormous volume of business that\r\nhad been caused by the destruction of San Francisco by the big\r\nearthquake. For six years the rebuilding of San Francisco had been\r\ngoing on, and his business had quadrupled and octupled, and yet he was\r\nno better off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe railroad knows my business just a little bit better than I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt knows my operating expenses to a cent, and it knows the terms\r\nof my contracts. How it knows these things I can only guess. It must\r\nhave spies in my employ, and it must have access to the parties to all\r\nmy contracts. For look you, when I place a big contract, the terms of\r\nwhich favor me a goodly profit, the freight rate from my quarry to\r\nmarket is promptly raised. No explanation is made. The railroad gets my\r\nprofit. Under such circumstances I have never succeeded in getting the\r\nrailroad to reconsider its raise. On the other hand, when there have\r\nbeen accidents, increased expenses of operating, or contracts with less\r\nprofitable terms, I have always succeeded in getting the railroad to\r\nlower its rate. What is the result? Large or small, the railroad always\r\ngets my profits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat remains to you over and above,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest interrupted to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\nroughly be the equivalent of your salary as a manager did the railroad\r\nown the quarry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Asmunsen replied. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a short time ago I had my\r\nbooks gone through for the past ten years. I discovered that for those\r\nten years my gain was just equivalent to a manager\xe2\x80\x99s salary. The\r\nrailroad might just as well have owned my quarry and hired me to run\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with this difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest laughed; \xe2\x80\x9cthe railroad would have\r\nhad to assume all the risk which you so obligingly assumed for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Asmunsen answered sadly.\r\n\r\nHaving let them have their say, Ernest began asking questions right and\r\nleft. He began with Mr. Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou started a branch store here in Berkeley about six months ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Owen answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that three little corner groceries have\r\ngone out of business. Was your branch store the cause of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Owen affirmed with a complacent smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThey had no chance against\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had greater capital. With a large business there is always less\r\nwaste and greater efficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your branch store absorbed the profits of the three small ones. I\r\nsee. But tell me, what became of the owners of the three stores?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is driving a delivery wagon for us. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened to\r\nthe other two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest turned abruptly on Mr. Kowalt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sell a great deal at cut-rates.[1] What have become of the owners\r\nof the small drug stores that you forced to the wall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] A lowering of selling price to cost, and even to less than cost.\r\n Thus, a large company could sell at a loss for a longer period than a\r\n small company, and so drive the small company out of business. A\r\n common device of competition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of them, Mr. Haasfurther, has charge now of our prescription\r\ndepartment,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you absorbed the profits they had been making?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely. That is what we are in business for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said suddenly to Mr. Asmunsen. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are disgusted\r\nbecause the railroad has absorbed your profits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Asmunsen nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you want is to make profits yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Asmunsen nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of others?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the way profits are made,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Asmunsen replied curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the business game is to make profits out of others, and to\r\nprevent others from making profits out of you. That\xe2\x80\x99s it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest had to repeat his question before Mr. Asmunsen gave an answer,\r\nand then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, except that we do not object to the others making\r\nprofits so long as they are not extortionate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy extortionate you mean large; yet you do not object to making large\r\nprofits yourself? . . . Surely not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Asmunsen amiably confessed to the weakness. There was one other\r\nman who was quizzed by Ernest at this juncture, a Mr. Calvin, who had\r\nonce been a great dairy-owner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome time ago you were fighting the Milk Trust,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said to him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand now you are in Grange politics.[2] How did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [2] Many efforts were made during this period to organize the\r\n perishing farmer class into a political party, the aim of which was to\r\n destroy the trusts and corporations by drastic legislation. All such\r\n attempts ended in failure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t quit the fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin answered, and he looked\r\nbelligerent enough. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fighting the Trust on the only field where it\r\nis possible to fight\xe2\x80\x94the political field. Let me show you. A few years\r\nago we dairymen had everything our own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you competed among yourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was what kept the profits down. We did try to organize, but\r\nindependent dairymen always broke through us. Then came the Milk\r\nTrust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinanced by surplus capital from Standard Oil,\xe2\x80\x9d[3] Ernest said.\r\n\r\n [3] The first successful great trust\xe2\x80\x94almost a generation in advance of\r\n the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin acknowledged. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we did not know it at the time.\r\nIts agents approached us with a club. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in and be fat,\xe2\x80\x9d was their\r\nproposition, \xe2\x80\x9cor stay out and starve.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of us came in. Those that\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t, starved. Oh, it paid us . . . at first. Milk was raised a cent\r\na quart. One-quarter of this cent came to us. Three-quarters of it went\r\nto the Trust. Then milk was raised another cent, only we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any\r\nof that cent. Our complaints were useless. The Trust was in control. We\r\ndiscovered that we were pawns. Finally, the additional quarter of a\r\ncent was denied us. Then the Trust began to squeeze us out. What could\r\nwe do? We were squeezed out. There were no dairymen, only a Milk\r\nTrust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with milk two cents higher, I should think you could have\r\ncompeted,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest suggested slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we thought. We tried it.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin paused a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt broke us.\r\nThe Trust could put milk upon the market more cheaply than we. It could\r\nsell still at a slight profit when we were selling at actual loss. I\r\ndropped fifty thousand dollars in that venture. Most of us went\r\nbankrupt.[4] The dairymen were wiped out of existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [4] Bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x94a peculiar institution that enabled an individual, who\r\n had failed in competitive industry, to forego paying his debts. The\r\n effect was to ameliorate the too savage conditions of the\r\n fang-and-claw social struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the Trust took your profits away from you,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve gone into politics in order to legislate the Trust out of\r\nexistence and get the profits back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Calvin\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted up. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is precisely what I say in my\r\nspeeches to the farmers. That\xe2\x80\x99s our whole idea in a nutshell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet the Trust produces milk more cheaply than could the\r\nindependent dairymen?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it, with the splendid organization and new machinery its\r\nlarge capital makes possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly should, and,\r\nfurthermore, it does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Calvin here launched out into a political speech in exposition of\r\nhis views. He was warmly followed by a number of the others, and the\r\ncry of all was to destroy the trusts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor simple folk,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said to me in an undertone. \xe2\x80\x9cThey see\r\nclearly as far as they see, but they see only to the ends of their\r\nnoses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little later he got the floor again, and in his characteristic way\r\ncontrolled it for the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have listened carefully to all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cand I see plainly\r\nthat you play the business game in the orthodox fashion. Life sums\r\nitself up to you in profits. You have a firm and abiding belief that\r\nyou were created for the sole purpose of making profits. Only there is\r\na hitch. In the midst of your own profit-making along comes the trust\r\nand takes your profits away from you. This is a dilemma that interferes\r\nsomehow with the aim of creation, and the only way out, as it seems to\r\nyou, is to destroy that which takes from you your profits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have listened carefully, and there is only one name that will\r\nepitomize you. I shall call you that name. You are machine-breakers. Do\r\nyou know what a machine-breaker is? Let me tell you. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury, in England, men and women wove cloth on hand-looms in their\r\nown cottages. It was a slow, clumsy, and costly way of weaving cloth,\r\nthis cottage system of manufacture. Along came the steam-engine and\r\nlabor-saving machinery. A thousand looms assembled in a large factory,\r\nand driven by a central engine wove cloth vastly more cheaply than\r\ncould the cottage weavers on their hand-looms. Here in the factory was\r\ncombination, and before it competition faded away. The men and women\r\nwho had worked the hand-looms for themselves now went into the\r\nfactories and worked the machine-looms, not for themselves, but for the\r\ncapitalist owners. Furthermore, little children went to work on the\r\nmachine-looms, at lower wages, and displaced the men. This made hard\r\ntimes for the men. Their standard of living fell. They starved. And\r\nthey said it was all the fault of the machines. Therefore, they\r\nproceeded to break the machines. They did not succeed, and they were\r\nvery stupid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you have not learned their lesson. Here are you, a century and a\r\nhalf later, trying to break machines. By your own confession the trust\r\nmachines do the work more efficiently and more cheaply than you can.\r\nThat is why you cannot compete with them. And yet you would break those\r\nmachines. You are even more stupid than the stupid workmen of England.\r\nAnd while you maunder about restoring competition, the trusts go on\r\ndestroying you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne and all you tell the same story,\xe2\x80\x94the passing away of competition\r\nand the coming on of combination. You, Mr. Owen, destroyed competition\r\nhere in Berkeley when your branch store drove the three small groceries\r\nout of business. Your combination was more effective. Yet you feel the\r\npressure of other combinations on you, the trust combinations, and you\r\ncry out. It is because you are not a trust. If you were a grocery trust\r\nfor the whole United States, you would be singing another song. And the\r\nsong would be, \xe2\x80\x98Blessed are the trusts.\xe2\x80\x99 And yet again, not only is\r\nyour small combination not a trust, but you are aware yourself of its\r\nlack of strength. You are beginning to divine your own end. You feel\r\nyourself and your branch stores a pawn in the game. You see the\r\npowerful interests rising and growing more powerful day by day; you\r\nfeel their mailed hands descending upon your profits and taking a pinch\r\nhere and a pinch there\xe2\x80\x94the railroad trust, the oil trust, the steel\r\ntrust, the coal trust; and you know that in the end they will destroy\r\nyou, take away from you the last per cent of your little profits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, sir, are a poor gamester. When you squeezed out the three small\r\ngroceries here in Berkeley by virtue of your superior combination, you\r\nswelled out your chest, talked about efficiency and enterprise, and\r\nsent your wife to Europe on the profits you had gained by eating up the\r\nthree small groceries. It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up. But, on\r\nthe other hand, you are being eaten up in turn by the bigger dogs,\r\nwherefore you squeal. And what I say to you is true of all of you at\r\nthis table. You are all squealing. You are all playing the losing game,\r\nand you are all squealing about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when you squeal you don\xe2\x80\x99t state the situation flatly, as I have\r\nstated it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t say that you like to squeeze profits out of\r\nothers, and that you are making all the row because others are\r\nsqueezing your profits out of you. No, you are too cunning for that.\r\nYou say something else. You make small-capitalist political speeches\r\nsuch as Mr. Calvin made. What did he say? Here are a few of his phrases\r\nI caught: \xe2\x80\x98Our original principles are all right,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What this country\r\nrequires is a return to fundamental American methods\xe2\x80\x94free opportunity\r\nfor all,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The spirit of liberty in which this nation was born,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Let\r\nus return to the principles of our forefathers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he says \xe2\x80\x98free opportunity for all,\xe2\x80\x99 he means free opportunity to\r\nsqueeze profits, which freedom of opportunity is now denied him by the\r\ngreat trusts. And the absurd thing about it is that you have repeated\r\nthese phrases so often that you believe them. You want opportunity to\r\nplunder your fellow-men in your own small way, but you hypnotize\r\nyourselves into thinking you want freedom. You are piggish and\r\nacquisitive, but the magic of your phrases leads you to believe that\r\nyou are patriotic. Your desire for profits, which is sheer selfishness,\r\nyou metamorphose into altruistic solicitude for suffering humanity.\r\nCome on now, right here amongst ourselves, and be honest for once. Look\r\nthe matter in the face and state it in direct terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were flushed and angry faces at the table, and withal a measure\r\nof awe. They were a little frightened at this smooth-faced young\r\nfellow, and the swing and smash of his words, and his dreadful trait of\r\ncalling a spade a spade. Mr. Calvin promptly replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can we not return to the ways of our\r\nfathers when this republic was founded? You have spoken much truth, Mr.\r\nEverhard, unpalatable though it has been. But here amongst ourselves\r\nlet us speak out. Let us throw off all disguise and accept the truth as\r\nMr. Everhard has flatly stated it. It is true that we smaller\r\ncapitalists are after profits, and that the trusts are taking our\r\nprofits away from us. It is true that we want to destroy the trusts in\r\norder that our profits may remain to us. And why can we not do it? Why\r\nnot? I say, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now we come to the gist of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said with a pleased\r\nexpression. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to tell you why not, though the telling will be\r\nrather hard. You see, you fellows have studied business, in a small\r\nway, but you have not studied social evolution at all. You are in the\r\nmidst of a transition stage now in economic evolution, but you do not\r\nunderstand it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what causes all the confusion. Why cannot you\r\nreturn? Because you can\xe2\x80\x99t. You can no more make water run up hill than\r\ncan you cause the tide of economic evolution to flow back in its\r\nchannel along the way it came. Joshua made the sun stand still upon\r\nGibeon, but you would outdo Joshua. You would make the sun go backward\r\nin the sky. You would have time retrace its steps from noon to morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the face of labor-saving machinery, of organized production, of the\r\nincreased efficiency of combination, you would set the economic sun\r\nback a whole generation or so to the time when there were no great\r\ncapitalists, no great machinery, no railroads\xe2\x80\x94a time when a host of\r\nlittle capitalists warred with each other in economic anarchy, and when\r\nproduction was primitive, wasteful, unorganized, and costly. Believe\r\nme, Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s task was easier, and he had Jehovah to help him. But God\r\nhas forsaken you small capitalists. The sun of the small capitalists is\r\nsetting. It will never rise again. Nor is it in your power even to make\r\nit stand still. You are perishing, and you are doomed to perish utterly\r\nfrom the face of society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the fiat of evolution. It is the word of God. Combination is\r\nstronger than competition. Primitive man was a puny creature hiding in\r\nthe crevices of the rocks. He combined and made war upon his\r\ncarnivorous enemies. They were competitive beasts. Primitive man was a\r\ncombinative beast, and because of it he rose to primacy over all the\r\nanimals. And man has been achieving greater and greater combinations\r\never since. It is combination _versus_ competition, a thousand\r\ncenturies long struggle, in which competition has always been worsted.\r\nWhoso enlists on the side of competition perishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the trusts themselves arose out of competition,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the trusts themselves destroyed\r\ncompetition. That, by your own word, is why you are no longer in the\r\ndairy business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first laughter of the evening went around the table, and even Mr.\r\nCalvin joined in the laugh against himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, while we are on the trusts,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest went on, \xe2\x80\x9clet us settle a\r\nfew things. I shall make certain statements, and if you disagree with\r\nthem, speak up. Silence will mean agreement. Is it not true that a\r\nmachine-loom will weave more cloth and weave more cheaply than a\r\nhand-loom?\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, but nobody spoke up. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not then highly\r\nirrational to break the machine-loom and go back to the clumsy and more\r\ncostly hand-loom method of weaving?\xe2\x80\x9d Heads nodded in acquiescence. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit not true that that known as a trust produces more efficiently and\r\ncheaply than can a thousand competing small concerns?\xe2\x80\x9d Still no one\r\nobjected. \xe2\x80\x9cThen is it not irrational to destroy that cheap and\r\nefficient combination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one answered for a long time. Then Mr. Kowalt spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cTo destroy the trusts is the\r\nonly way we can see to escape their domination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was all fire and aliveness on the instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you another way!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us not destroy those\r\nwonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply. Let us control\r\nthem. Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness. Let us run them\r\nfor ourselves. Let us oust the present owners of the wonderful\r\nmachines, and let us own the wonderful machines ourselves. That,\r\ngentlemen, is socialism, a greater combination than the trusts, a\r\ngreater economic and social combination than any that has as yet\r\nappeared on the planet. It is in line with evolution. We meet\r\ncombination with greater combination. It is the winning side. Come on\r\nover with us socialists and play on the winning side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere arose dissent. There was a shaking of heads, and mutterings arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then, you prefer to be anachronisms,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nprefer to play atavistic r\xc3\xb4les. You are doomed to perish as all\r\natavisms perish. Have you ever asked what will happen to you when\r\ngreater combinations than even the present trusts arise? Have you ever\r\nconsidered where you will stand when the great trusts themselves\r\ncombine into the combination of combinations\xe2\x80\x94into the social, economic,\r\nand political trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly and irrelevantly upon Mr. Calvin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said, \xe2\x80\x9cif this is not true. You are compelled to form\r\na new political party because the old parties are in the hands of the\r\ntrusts. The chief obstacle to your Grange propaganda is the trusts.\r\nBehind every obstacle you encounter, every blow that smites you, every\r\ndefeat that you receive, is the hand of the trusts. Is this not so?\r\nTell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Calvin sat in uncomfortable silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest encouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe captured the state legislature\r\nof Oregon and put through splendid protective legislation, and it was\r\nvetoed by the governor, who was a creature of the trusts. We elected a\r\ngovernor of Colorado, and the legislature refused to permit him to take\r\noffice. Twice we have passed a national income tax, and each time the\r\nsupreme court smashed it as unconstitutional. The courts are in the\r\nhands of the trusts. We, the people, do not pay our judges\r\nsufficiently. But there will come a time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the combination of the trusts will control all legislation, when\r\nthe combination of the trusts will itself be the government,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! never!\xe2\x80\x9d were the cries that arose. Everybody was excited and\r\nbelligerent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will you do when such a time comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will rise in our strength!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Asmunsen cried, and many voices\r\nbacked his decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be civil war,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest warned them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it, civil war,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr. Asmunsen\xe2\x80\x99s answer, with the cries of all\r\nthe men at the table behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have not forgotten the deeds of\r\nour forefathers. For our liberties we are ready to fight and die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not forget,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we had tacitly agreed that liberty in\r\nyour case, gentlemen, means liberty to squeeze profits out of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe table was angry, now, fighting angry; but Ernest controlled the\r\ntumult and made himself heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more question. When you rise in your strength, remember, the\r\nreason for your rising will be that the government is in the hands of\r\nthe trusts. Therefore, against your strength the government will turn\r\nthe regular army, the navy, the militia, the police\xe2\x80\x94in short, the whole\r\norganized war machinery of the United States. Where will your strength\r\nbe then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDismay sat on their faces, and before they could recover, Ernest struck\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember, not so long ago, when our regular army was only fifty\r\nthousand? Year by year it has been increased until to-day it is three\r\nhundred thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he struck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor is that all. While you diligently pursued that favorite phantom of\r\nyours, called profits, and moralized about that favorite fetich of\r\nyours, called competition, even greater and more direful things have\r\nbeen accomplished by combination. There is the militia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our strength!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Kowalt. \xe2\x80\x9cWith it we would repel the\r\ninvasion of the regular army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would go into the militia yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d was Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s retort, \xe2\x80\x9cand be\r\nsent to Maine, or Florida, or the Philippines, or anywhere else, to\r\ndrown in blood your own comrades civil-warring for their liberties.\r\nWhile from Kansas, or Wisconsin, or any other state, your own comrades\r\nwould go into the militia and come here to California to drown in blood\r\nyour own civil-warring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow they were really shocked, and they sat wordless, until Mr. Owen\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would not go into the militia. That would settle it. We would not\r\nbe so foolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not understand the combination that has been effected. You\r\ncould not help yourself. You would be drafted into the militia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is such a thing as civil law,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Owen insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when the government suspends civil law. In that day when you speak\r\nof rising in your strength, your strength would be turned against\r\nyourself. Into the militia you would go, willy-nilly. Habeas corpus, I\r\nheard some one mutter just now. Instead of habeas corpus you would get\r\npost mortems. If you refused to go into the militia, or to obey after\r\nyou were in, you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down\r\nlike dogs. It is the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the law!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin asserted positively. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such\r\nlaw. Young man, you have dreamed all this. Why, you spoke of sending\r\nthe militia to the Philippines. That is unconstitutional. The\r\nConstitution especially states that the militia cannot be sent out of\r\nthe country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the Constitution got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncourts interpret the Constitution, and the courts, as Mr. Asmunsen\r\nagreed, are the creatures of the trusts. Besides, it is as I have said,\r\nthe law. It has been the law for years, for nine years, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we can be drafted into the militia?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin asked\r\nincredulously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat they can shoot us by drumhead court martial if we\r\nrefuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest answered, \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it that we have never heard of this law?\xe2\x80\x9d my father asked, and\r\nI could see that it was likewise new to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, there has been no need to\r\nenforce it. If there had, you\xe2\x80\x99d have heard of it soon enough. And\r\nsecondly, the law was rushed through Congress and the Senate secretly,\r\nwith practically no discussion. Of course, the newspapers made no\r\nmention of it. But we socialists knew about it. We published it in our\r\npapers. But you never read our papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still insist you are dreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin said stubbornly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncountry would never have permitted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the country did permit it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for my\r\ndreaming\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small\r\npamphlet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctell me if this looks like dream-stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened it and began to read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Section One, be it enacted, and so forth and so forth, that the\r\nmilitia shall consist of every able-bodied male citizen of the\r\nrespective states, territories, and District of Columbia, who is more\r\nthan eighteen and less than forty-five years of age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Section Seven, that any officer or enlisted man\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94remember Section\r\nOne, gentlemen, you are all enlisted men\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98that any enlisted man of the\r\nmilitia who shall refuse or neglect to present himself to such\r\nmustering officer upon being called forth as herein prescribed, shall\r\nbe subject to trial by court martial, and shall be punished as such\r\ncourt martial shall direct.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Section Eight, that courts martial, for the trial of officers or men\r\nof the militia, shall be composed of militia officers only.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Section Nine, that the militia, when called into the actual service\r\nof the United States, shall be subject to the same rules and articles\r\nof war as the regular troops of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are gentlemen, American citizens, and fellow-militiamen.\r\nNine years ago we socialists thought that law was aimed against labor.\r\nBut it would seem that it was aimed against you, too. Congressman\r\nWiley, in the brief discussion that was permitted, said that the bill\r\n\xe2\x80\x98provided for a reserve force to take the mob by the throat\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nmob, gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98and protect at all hazards life, liberty, and\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x99 And in the time to come, when you rise in your strength,\r\nremember that you will be rising against the property of the trusts,\r\nand the liberty of the trusts, according to the law, to squeeze you.\r\nYour teeth are pulled, gentlemen. Your claws are trimmed. In the day\r\nyou rise in your strength, toothless and clawless, you will be as\r\nharmless as any army of clams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d Kowalt cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such law. It is a\r\ncanard got up by you socialists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on July 30,\r\n1902,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was introduced by Representative Dick of\r\nOhio. It was rushed through. It was passed unanimously by the Senate on\r\nJanuary 14, 1903. And just seven days afterward was approved by the\r\nPresident of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d[5]\r\n\r\n [5] Everhard was right in the essential particulars, though his date\r\n of the introduction of the bill is in error. The bill was introduced\r\n on June 30, and not on July 30. The _Congressional Record_ is here in\r\n Ardis, and a reference to it shows mention of the bill on the\r\n following dates: June 30, December 9, 15, 16, and 17, 1902, and\r\n January 7 and 14, 1903. The ignorance evidenced by the business men at\r\n the dinner was nothing unusual. Very few people knew of the existence\r\n of this law. E. Untermann, a revolutionist, in July, 1903, published a\r\n pamphlet at Girard, Kansas, on the \xe2\x80\x9cMilitia Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d This pamphlet had a\r\n small circulation among workingmen; but already had the segregation of\r\n classes proceeded so far, that the members of the middle class never\r\n heard of the pamphlet at all, and so remained in ignorance of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF A DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the consternation his revelation had produced, Ernest\r\nbegan again to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have said, a dozen of you to-night, that socialism is impossible.\r\nYou have asserted the impossible, now let me demonstrate the\r\ninevitable. Not only is it inevitable that you small capitalists shall\r\npass away, but it is inevitable that the large capitalists, and the\r\ntrusts also, shall pass away. Remember, the tide of evolution never\r\nflows backward. It flows on and on, and it flows from competition to\r\ncombination, and from little combination to large combination, and from\r\nlarge combination to colossal combination, and it flows on to\r\nsocialism, which is the most colossal combination of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me that I dream. Very good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the mathematics of\r\nmy dream; and here, in advance, I challenge you to show that my\r\nmathematics are wrong. I shall develop the inevitability of the\r\nbreakdown of the capitalist system, and I shall demonstrate\r\nmathematically why it must break down. Here goes, and bear with me if\r\nat first I seem irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us, first of all, investigate a particular industrial process, and\r\nwhenever I state something with which you disagree, please interrupt\r\nme. Here is a shoe factory. This factory takes leather and makes it\r\ninto shoes. Here is one hundred dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of leather. It goes\r\nthrough the factory and comes out in the form of shoes, worth, let us\r\nsay, two hundred dollars. What has happened? One hundred dollars has\r\nbeen added to the value of the leather. How was it added? Let us see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital and labor added this value of one hundred dollars. Capital\r\nfurnished the factory, the machines, and paid all the expenses. Labor\r\nfurnished labor. By the joint effort of capital and labor one hundred\r\ndollars of value was added. Are you all agreed so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeads nodded around the table in affirmation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLabor and capital having produced this one hundred dollars, now\r\nproceed to divide it. The statistics of this division are fractional;\r\nso let us, for the sake of convenience, make them roughly approximate.\r\nCapital takes fifty dollars as its share, and labor gets in wages fifty\r\ndollars as its share. We will not enter into the squabbling over the\r\ndivision.[1] No matter how much squabbling takes place, in one\r\npercentage or another the division is arranged. And take notice here,\r\nthat what is true of this particular industrial process is true of all\r\nindustrial processes. Am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] Everhard here clearly develops the cause of all the labor troubles\r\n of that time. In the division of the joint-product, capital wanted all\r\n it could get, and labor wanted all it could get. This quarrel over the\r\n division was irreconcilable. So long as the system of capitalistic\r\n production existed, labor and capital continued to quarrel over the\r\n division of the joint-product. It is a ludicrous spectacle to us, but\r\n we must not forget that we have seven centuries\xe2\x80\x99 advantage over those\r\n that lived in that time.\r\n\r\nAgain the whole table agreed with Ernest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, suppose labor, having received its fifty dollars, wanted to buy\r\nback shoes. It could only buy back fifty dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth. That\xe2\x80\x99s clear,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we shift from this particular process to the sum total of all\r\nindustrial processes in the United States, which includes the leather\r\nitself, raw material, transportation, selling, everything. We will say,\r\nfor the sake of round figures, that the total production of wealth in\r\nthe United States in one year is four billion dollars. Then labor has\r\nreceived in wages, during the same period, two billion dollars. Four\r\nbillion dollars has been produced. How much of this can labor buy back?\r\nTwo billions. There is no discussion of this, I am sure. For that\r\nmatter, my percentages are mild. Because of a thousand capitalistic\r\ndevices, labor cannot buy back even half of the total product.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to return. We will say labor buys back two billions. Then it\r\nstands to reason that labor can consume only two billions. There are\r\nstill two billions to be accounted for, which labor cannot buy back and\r\nconsume.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLabor does not consume its two billions, even,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kowalt spoke up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it did, it would not have any deposits in the savings banks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLabor\xe2\x80\x99s deposits in the savings banks are only a sort of reserve fund\r\nthat is consumed as fast as it accumulates. These deposits are saved\r\nfor old age, for sickness and accident, and for funeral expenses. The\r\nsavings bank deposit is simply a piece of the loaf put back on the\r\nshelf to be eaten next day. No, labor consumes all of the total product\r\nthat its wages will buy back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo billions are left to capital. After it has paid its expenses, does\r\nit consume the remainder? Does capital consume all of its two\r\nbillions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest stopped and put the question point blank to a number of the men.\r\nThey shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them frankly said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you do,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest went on. \xe2\x80\x9cStop and think a moment. If\r\ncapital consumed its share, the sum total of capital could not\r\nincrease. It would remain constant. If you will look at the economic\r\nhistory of the United States, you will see that the sum total of\r\ncapital has continually increased. Therefore capital does not consume\r\nits share. Do you remember when England owned so much of our railroad\r\nbonds? As the years went by, we bought back those bonds. What does that\r\nmean? That part of capital\xe2\x80\x99s unconsumed share bought back the bonds.\r\nWhat is the meaning of the fact that to-day the capitalists of the\r\nUnited States own hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of\r\nMexican bonds, Russian bonds, Italian bonds, Grecian bonds? The meaning\r\nis that those hundreds and hundreds of millions were part of capital\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshare which capital did not consume. Furthermore, from the very\r\nbeginning of the capitalist system, capital has never consumed all of\r\nits share.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we come to the point. Four billion dollars of wealth is\r\nproduced in one year in the United States. Labor buys back and consumes\r\ntwo billions. Capital does not consume the remaining two billions.\r\nThere is a large balance left over unconsumed. What is done with this\r\nbalance? What can be done with it? Labor cannot consume any of it, for\r\nlabor has already spent all its wages. Capital will not consume this\r\nbalance, because, already, according to its nature, it has consumed all\r\nit can. And still remains the balance. What can be done with it? What\r\nis done with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sold abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kowalt volunteered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of this balance arises our\r\nneed for a foreign market. This is sold abroad. It has to be sold\r\nabroad. There is no other way of getting rid of it. And that unconsumed\r\nsurplus, sold abroad, becomes what we call our favorable balance of\r\ntrade. Are we all agreed so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely it is a waste of time to elaborate these A B C\xe2\x80\x99s of commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Calvin said tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all understand them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is by these A B C\xe2\x80\x99s I have so carefully elaborated that I shall\r\nconfound you,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of it. And I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to confound you with them right now. Here goes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States is a capitalist country that has developed its\r\nresources. According to its capitalist system of industry, it has an\r\nunconsumed surplus that must be got rid of, and that must be got rid of\r\nabroad.[2] What is true of the United States is true of every other\r\ncapitalist country with developed resources. Every one of such\r\ncountries has an unconsumed surplus. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that they have\r\nalready traded with one another, and that these surpluses yet remain.\r\nLabor in all these countries has spent its wages, and cannot buy any of\r\nthe surpluses. Capital in all these countries has already consumed all\r\nit is able according to its nature. And still remain the surpluses.\r\nThey cannot dispose of these surpluses to one another. How are they\r\ngoing to get rid of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [2] Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States a few years\r\n prior to this time, made the following public declaration: \xe2\x80\x9c_A more\r\n liberal and extensive reciprocity in the purchase and sale of\r\n commodities is necessary, so that the overproduction of the United\r\n States can be satisfactorily disposed of to foreign countries._\xe2\x80\x9d Of\r\n course, this overproduction he mentions was the profits of the\r\n capitalist system over and beyond the consuming power of the\r\n capitalists. It was at this time that Senator Mark Hanna said: \xe2\x80\x9c_The\r\n production of wealth in the United States is one-third larger annually\r\n than its consumption._\xe2\x80\x9d Also a fellow-Senator, Chauncey Depew, said:\r\n \xe2\x80\x9c_The American people produce annually two billions more wealth than\r\n they consume._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell them to countries with undeveloped resources,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kowalt\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing. You see, my argument is so clear and simple that in\r\nyour own minds you carry it on for me. And now for the next step.\r\nSuppose the United States disposes of its surplus to a country with\r\nundeveloped resources like, say, Brazil. Remember this surplus is over\r\nand above trade, which articles of trade have been consumed. What,\r\nthen, does the United States get in return from Brazil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Kowalt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is only so much gold, and not much of it, in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nErnest objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold in the form of securities and bonds and so forth,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kowalt\r\namended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve struck it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Brazil the United States, in\r\nreturn for her surplus, gets bonds and securities. And what does that\r\nmean? It means that the United States is coming to own railroads in\r\nBrazil, factories, mines, and lands in Brazil. And what is the meaning\r\nof that in turn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kowalt pondered and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means that the resources of\r\nBrazil are being developed. And now, the next point. When Brazil, under\r\nthe capitalist system, has developed her resources, she will herself\r\nhave an unconsumed surplus. Can she get rid of this surplus to the\r\nUnited States? No, because the United States has herself a surplus. Can\r\nthe United States do what she previously did\xe2\x80\x94get rid of her surplus to\r\nBrazil? No, for Brazil now has a surplus, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens? The United States and Brazil must both seek out other\r\ncountries with undeveloped resources, in order to unload the surpluses\r\non them. But by the very process of unloading the surpluses, the\r\nresources of those countries are in turn developed. Soon they have\r\nsurpluses, and are seeking other countries on which to unload. Now,\r\ngentlemen, follow me. The planet is only so large. There are only so\r\nmany countries in the world. What will happen when every country in the\r\nworld, down to the smallest and last, with a surplus in its hands,\r\nstands confronting every other country with surpluses in their hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused and regarded his listeners. The bepuzzlement in their faces\r\nwas delicious. Also, there was awe in their faces. Out of abstractions\r\nErnest had conjured a vision and made them see it. They were seeing it\r\nthen, as they sat there, and they were frightened by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe started with A B C, Mr. Calvin,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said slyly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have now\r\ngiven you the rest of the alphabet. It is very simple. That is the\r\nbeauty of it. You surely have the answer forthcoming. What, then, when\r\nevery country in the world has an unconsumed surplus? Where will your\r\ncapitalist system be then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Calvin shook a troubled head. He was obviously questing back\r\nthrough Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in search of an error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me briefly go over the ground with you again,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nbegan with a particular industrial process, the shoe factory. We found\r\nthat the division of the joint product that took place there was\r\nsimilar to the division that took place in the sum total of all\r\nindustrial processes. We found that labor could buy back with its wages\r\nonly so much of the product, and that capital did not consume all of\r\nthe remainder of the product. We found that when labor had consumed to\r\nthe full extent of its wages, and when capital had consumed all it\r\nwanted, there was still left an unconsumed surplus. We agreed that this\r\nsurplus could only be disposed of abroad. We agreed, also, that the\r\neffect of unloading this surplus on another country would be to develop\r\nthe resources of that country, and that in a short time that country\r\nwould have an unconsumed surplus. We extended this process to all the\r\ncountries on the planet, till every country was producing every year,\r\nand every day, an unconsumed surplus, which it could dispose of to no\r\nother country. And now I ask you again, what are we going to do with\r\nthose surpluses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill no one answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Calvin?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt beats me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never dreamed of such a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Asmunsen said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it does\r\nseem clear as print.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had ever heard Karl Marx\xe2\x80\x99s[3] doctrine of\r\nsurplus value elaborated, and Ernest had done it so simply that I, too,\r\nsat puzzled and dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n [3] Karl Marx\xe2\x80\x94the great intellectual hero of Socialism. A German Jew\r\n of the nineteenth century. A contemporary of John Stuart Mill. It\r\n seems incredible to us that whole generations should have elapsed\r\n after the enunciation of Marx\xe2\x80\x99s economic discoveries, in which time he\r\n was sneered at by the world\xe2\x80\x99s accepted thinkers and scholars. Because\r\n of his discoveries he was banished from his native country, and he\r\n died an exile in England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a way to get rid of the surplus,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cThrow it\r\ninto the sea. Throw every year hundreds of millions of dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth\r\nof shoes and wheat and clothing and all the commodities of commerce\r\ninto the sea. Won\xe2\x80\x99t that fix it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will certainly fix it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is absurd for\r\nyou to talk that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was upon him like a flash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a bit more absurd than what you advocate, you machine-breaker,\r\nreturning to the antediluvian ways of your forefathers? What do you\r\npropose in order to get rid of the surplus? You would escape the\r\nproblem of the surplus by not producing any surplus. And how do you\r\npropose to avoid producing a surplus? By returning to a primitive\r\nmethod of production, so confused and disorderly and irrational, so\r\nwasteful and costly, that it will be impossible to produce a surplus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Calvin swallowed. The point had been driven home. He swallowed\r\nagain and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI stand convicted. It is absurd. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to do something. It is a case of life and death for us of the\r\nmiddle class. We refuse to perish. We elect to be absurd and to return\r\nto the truly crude and wasteful methods of our forefathers. We will put\r\nback industry to its pre-trust stage. We will break the machines. And\r\nwhat are you going to do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t break the machines,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot make\r\nthe tide of evolution flow backward. Opposed to you are two great\r\nforces, each of which is more powerful than you of the middle class.\r\nThe large capitalists, the trusts, in short, will not let you turn\r\nback. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want the machines destroyed. And greater than the\r\ntrusts, and more powerful, is labor. It will not let you destroy the\r\nmachines. The ownership of the world, along with the machines, lies\r\nbetween the trusts and labor. That is the battle alignment. Neither\r\nside wants the destruction of the machines. But each side wants to\r\npossess the machines. In this battle the middle class has no place. The\r\nmiddle class is a pygmy between two giants. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, you poor\r\nperishing middle class, you are caught between the upper and nether\r\nmillstones, and even now has the grinding begun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have demonstrated to you mathematically the inevitable breakdown of\r\nthe capitalist system. When every country stands with an unconsumed and\r\nunsalable surplus on its hands, the capitalist system will break down\r\nunder the terrific structure of profits that it itself has reared. And\r\nin that day there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any destruction of the machines. The\r\nstruggle then will be for the ownership of the machines. If labor wins,\r\nyour way will be easy. The United States, and the whole world for that\r\nmatter, will enter upon a new and tremendous era. Instead of being\r\ncrushed by the machines, life will be made fairer, and happier, and\r\nnobler by them. You of the destroyed middle class, along with\r\nlabor\xe2\x80\x94there will be nothing but labor then; so you, and all the rest of\r\nlabor, will participate in the equitable distribution of the products\r\nof the wonderful machines. And we, all of us, will make new and more\r\nwonderful machines. And there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any unconsumed surplus, because\r\nthere won\xe2\x80\x99t be any profits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose the trusts win in this battle over the ownership of the\r\nmachines and the world?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kowalt asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, and labor, and all of us, will be\r\ncrushed under the iron heel of a despotism as relentless and terrible\r\nas any despotism that has blackened the pages of the history of man.\r\nThat will be a good name for that despotism, the Iron Heel.\xe2\x80\x9d[4]\r\n\r\n [4] The earliest known use of that name to designate the Oligarchy.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, and every man at the table meditated in ways\r\nunwonted and profound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this socialism of yours is a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin said; and\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9ca dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you something that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dream, then,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that something I shall call the Oligarchy. You call it the\r\nPlutocracy. We both mean the same thing, the large capitalists or the\r\ntrusts. Let us see where the power lies today. And in order to do so,\r\nlet us apportion society into its class divisions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are three big classes in society. First comes the Plutocracy,\r\nwhich is composed of wealthy bankers, railway magnates, corporation\r\ndirectors, and trust magnates. Second, is the middle class, your class,\r\ngentlemen, which is composed of farmers, merchants, small\r\nmanufacturers, and professional men. And third and last comes my class,\r\nthe proletariat, which is composed of the wage-workers.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] This division of society made by Everhard is in accordance with\r\n that made by Lucien Sanial, one of the statistical authorities of that\r\n time. His calculation of the membership of these divisions by\r\n occupation, from the United States Census of 1900, is as follows:\r\n Plutocratic class, 250,251; Middle class, 8,429,845; and Proletariat\r\n class, 20,393,137.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot but grant that the ownership of wealth constitutes\r\nessential power in the United States to-day. How is this wealth owned\r\nby these three classes? Here are the figures. The Plutocracy owns\r\nsixty-seven billions of wealth. Of the total number of persons engaged\r\nin occupations in the United States, only nine-tenths of one per cent\r\nare from the Plutocracy, yet the Plutocracy owns seventy per cent of\r\nthe total wealth. The middle class owns twenty-four billions.\r\nTwenty-nine per cent of those in occupations are from the middle class,\r\nand they own twenty-five per cent of the total wealth. Remains the\r\nproletariat. It owns four billions. Of all persons in occupations,\r\nseventy per cent come from the proletariat; and the proletariat owns\r\nfour per cent of the total wealth. Where does the power lie,\r\ngentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your own figures, we of the middle class are more powerful than\r\nlabor,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Asmunsen remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalling us weak does not make you stronger in the face of the strength\r\nof the Plutocracy,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd furthermore, I\xe2\x80\x99m not done\r\nwith you. There is a greater strength than wealth, and it is greater\r\nbecause it cannot be taken away. Our strength, the strength of the\r\nproletariat, is in our muscles, in our hands to cast ballots, in our\r\nfingers to pull triggers. This strength we cannot be stripped of. It is\r\nthe primitive strength, it is the strength that is to life germane, it\r\nis the strength that is stronger than wealth, and that wealth cannot\r\ntake away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your strength is detachable. It can be taken away from you. Even\r\nnow the Plutocracy is taking it away from you. In the end it will take\r\nit all away from you. And then you will cease to be the middle class.\r\nYou will descend to us. You will become proletarians. And the beauty of\r\nit is that you will then add to our strength. We will hail you\r\nbrothers, and we will fight shoulder to shoulder in the cause of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, labor has nothing concrete of which to be despoiled. Its\r\nshare of the wealth of the country consists of clothes and household\r\nfurniture, with here and there, in very rare cases, an unencumbered\r\nhome. But you have the concrete wealth, twenty-four billions of it, and\r\nthe Plutocracy will take it away from you. Of course, there is the\r\nlarge likelihood that the proletariat will take it away first. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see your position, gentlemen? The middle class is a wobbly little\r\nlamb between a lion and a tiger. If one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you, the other\r\nwill. And if the Plutocracy gets you first, why it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of\r\ntime when the Proletariat gets the Plutocracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven your present wealth is not a true measure of your power. The\r\nstrength of your wealth at this moment is only an empty shell. That is\r\nwhy you are crying out your feeble little battle-cry, \xe2\x80\x98Return to the\r\nways of our fathers.\xe2\x80\x99 You are aware of your impotency. You know that\r\nyour strength is an empty shell. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the emptiness of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat power have the farmers? Over fifty per cent are thralls by virtue\r\nof the fact that they are merely tenants or are mortgaged. And all of\r\nthem are thralls by virtue of the fact that the trusts already own or\r\ncontrol (which is the same thing only better)\xe2\x80\x94own and control all the\r\nmeans of marketing the crops, such as cold storage, railroads,\r\nelevators, and steamship lines. And, furthermore, the trusts control\r\nthe markets. In all this the farmers are without power. As regards\r\ntheir political and governmental power, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that up later, along\r\nwith the political and governmental power of the whole middle class.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay by day the trusts squeeze out the farmers as they squeezed out Mr.\r\nCalvin and the rest of the dairymen. And day by day are the merchants\r\nsqueezed out in the same way. Do you remember how, in six months, the\r\nTobacco Trust squeezed out over four hundred cigar stores in New York\r\nCity alone? Where are the old-time owners of the coal fields? You know\r\ntoday, without my telling you, that the Railroad Trust owns or controls\r\nthe entire anthracite and bituminous coal fields. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the Standard\r\nOil Trust[6] own a score of the ocean lines? And does it not also\r\ncontrol copper, to say nothing of running a smelter trust as a little\r\nside enterprise? There are ten thousand cities in the United States\r\nto-night lighted by the companies owned or controlled by Standard Oil,\r\nand in as many cities all the electric transportation,\xe2\x80\x94urban, suburban,\r\nand interurban,\xe2\x80\x94is in the hands of Standard Oil. The small capitalists\r\nwho were in these thousands of enterprises are gone. You know that.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same way that you are going.\r\n\r\n [6] Standard Oil and Rockefeller\xe2\x80\x94see footnote [10]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe small manufacturer is like the farmer; and small manufacturers and\r\nfarmers to-day are reduced, to all intents and purposes, to feudal\r\ntenure. For that matter, the professional men and the artists are at\r\nthis present moment villeins in everything but name, while the\r\npoliticians are henchmen. Why do you, Mr. Calvin, work all your nights\r\nand days to organize the farmers, along with the rest of the middle\r\nclass, into a new political party? Because the politicians of the old\r\nparties will have nothing to do with your atavistic ideas; and with\r\nyour atavistic ideas, they will have nothing to do because they are\r\nwhat I said they are, henchmen, retainers of the Plutocracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke of the professional men and the artists as villeins. What else\r\nare they? One and all, the professors, the preachers, and the editors,\r\nhold their jobs by serving the Plutocracy, and their service consists\r\nof propagating only such ideas as are either harmless to or\r\ncommendatory of the Plutocracy. Whenever they propagate ideas that\r\nmenace the Plutocracy, they lose their jobs, in which case, if they\r\nhave not provided for the rainy day, they descend into the proletariat\r\nand either perish or become working-class agitators. And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nthat it is the press, the pulpit, and the university that mould public\r\nopinion, set the thought-pace of the nation. As for the artists, they\r\nmerely pander to the little less than ignoble tastes of the Plutocracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all, wealth in itself is not the real power; it is the means\r\nto power, and power is governmental. Who controls the government\r\nto-day? The proletariat with its twenty millions engaged in\r\noccupations? Even you laugh at the idea. Does the middle class, with\r\nits eight million occupied members? No more than the proletariat. Who,\r\nthen, controls the government? The Plutocracy, with its paltry quarter\r\nof a million of occupied members. But this quarter of a million does\r\nnot control the government, though it renders yeoman service. It is the\r\nbrain of the Plutocracy that controls the government, and this brain\r\nconsists of seven[7] small and powerful groups of men. And do not\r\nforget that these groups are working to-day practically in unison.\r\n\r\n [7] Even as late as 1907, it was considered that eleven groups\r\n dominated the country, but this number was reduced by the amalgamation\r\n of the five railroad groups into a supreme combination of all the\r\n railroads. These five groups so amalgamated, along with their\r\n financial and political allies, were (1) James J. Hill with his\r\n control of the Northwest; (2) the Pennsylvania railway group, Schiff\r\n financial manager, with big banking firms of Philadelphia and New\r\n York; (3) Harriman, with Frick for counsel and Odell as political\r\n lieutenant, controlling the central continental, Southwestern and\r\n Southern Pacific Coast lines of transportation; (4) the Gould family\r\n railway interests; and (5) Moore, Reid, and Leeds, known as the \xe2\x80\x9cRock\r\n Island crowd.\xe2\x80\x9d These strong oligarchs arose out of the conflict of\r\n competition and travelled the inevitable road toward combination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me point out the power of but one of them, the railroad group. It\r\nemploys forty thousand lawyers to defeat the people in the courts. It\r\nissues countless thousands of free passes to judges, bankers, editors,\r\nministers, university men, members of state legislatures, and of\r\nCongress. It maintains luxurious lobbies[8] at every state capital, and\r\nat the national capital; and in all the cities and towns of the land it\r\nemploys an immense army of pettifoggers and small politicians whose\r\nbusiness is to attend primaries, pack conventions, get on juries, bribe\r\njudges, and in every way to work for its interests.[9]\r\n\r\n [8] _Lobby_\xe2\x80\x94a peculiar institution for bribing, bulldozing, and\r\n corrupting the legislators who were supposed to represent the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n interests.\r\n\r\n [9] A decade before this speech of Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s, the New York Board of\r\n Trade issued a report from which the following is quoted: \xe2\x80\x9c_The\r\n railroads control absolutely the legislatures of a majority of the\r\n states of the Union; they make and unmake United States Senators,\r\n congressmen, and governors, and are practically dictators of the\r\n governmental policy of the United States._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I have merely sketched the power of one of the seven groups\r\nthat constitute the brain of the Plutocracy.[10] Your twenty-four\r\nbillions of wealth does not give you twenty-five cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth of\r\ngovernmental power. It is an empty shell, and soon even the empty shell\r\nwill be taken away from you. The Plutocracy has all power in its hands\r\nto-day. It to-day makes the laws, for it owns the Senate, Congress, the\r\ncourts, and the state legislatures. And not only that. Behind law must\r\nbe force to execute the law. To-day the Plutocracy makes the law, and\r\nto enforce the law it has at its beck and call the police, the army,\r\nthe navy, and, lastly, the militia, which is you, and me, and all of\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [10] Rockefeller began as a member of the proletariat, and through\r\n thrift and cunning succeeded in developing the first perfect trust,\r\n namely that known as Standard Oil. We cannot forbear giving the\r\n following remarkable page from the history of the times, to show how\r\n the need for reinvestment of the Standard Oil surplus crushed out\r\n small capitalists and hastened the breakdown of the capitalist system.\r\n David Graham Phillips was a radical writer of the period, and the\r\n quotation, by him, is taken from a copy of the _Saturday Evening\r\n Post_, dated October 4, 1902 A.D. This is the only copy of this\r\n publication that has come down to us, and yet, from its appearance and\r\n content, we cannot but conclude that it was one of the popular\r\n periodicals with a large circulation. The quotation here follows:\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_About ten years ago Rockefeller\xe2\x80\x99s income was given as thirty\r\n    millions by an excellent authority. He had reached the limit of\r\n    profitable investment of profits in the oil industry. Here, then,\r\n    were these enormous sums in cash pouring in\xe2\x80\x94more than $2,000,000 a\r\n    month for John Davison Rockefeller alone. The problem of\r\n    reinvestment became more serious. It became a nightmare. The oil\r\n    income was swelling, swelling, and the number of sound investments\r\n    limited, even more limited than it is now. It was through no\r\n    special eagerness for more gains that the Rockefellers began to\r\n    branch out from oil into other things. They were forced, swept on\r\n    by this inrolling tide of wealth which their monopoly magnet\r\n    irresistibly attracted. They developed a staff of investment\r\n    seekers and investigators. It is said that the chief of this staff\r\n    has a salary of $125,000 a year.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe first conspicuous excursion and incursion of the Rockefellers\r\n    was into the railway field. By 1895 they controlled one-fifth of\r\n    the railway mileage of the country. What do they own or, through\r\n    dominant ownership, control to-day? They are powerful in all the\r\n    great railways of New York, north, east, and west, except one,\r\n    where their share is only a few millions. They are in most of the\r\n    great railways radiating from Chicago. They dominate in several of\r\n    the systems that extend to the Pacific. It is their votes that make\r\n    Mr. Morgan so potent, though, it may be added, they need his brains\r\n    more than he needs their votes\xe2\x80\x94 at present, and the combination of\r\n    the two constitutes in large measure the \xe2\x80\x98community of interest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut railways could not alone absorb rapidly enough those mighty\r\n    floods of gold. Presently John D. Rockefeller\xe2\x80\x99s $2,500,000 a month\r\n    had increased to four, to five, to six millions a month, to\r\n    $75,000,000 a year. Illuminating oil was becoming all profit. The\r\n    reinvestments of income were adding their mite of many annual\r\n    millions.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rockefellers went into gas and electricity when those\r\n    industries had developed to the safe investment stage. And now a\r\n    large part of the American people must begin to enrich the\r\n    Rockefellers as soon as the sun goes down, no matter what form of\r\n    illuminant they use. They went into farm mortgages. It is said that\r\n    when prosperity a few years ago enabled the farmers to rid\r\n    themselves of their mortgages, John D. Rockefeller was moved almost\r\n    to tears; eight millions which he had thought taken care of for\r\n    years to come at a good interest were suddenly dumped upon his\r\n    doorstep and there set up a-squawking for a new home. This\r\n    unexpected addition to his worriments in finding places for the\r\n    progeny of his petroleum and their progeny and their progeny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    progeny was too much for the equanimity of a man without a\r\n    digestion. . . .\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rockefellers went into mines\xe2\x80\x94iron and coal and copper and\r\n    lead; into other industrial companies; into street railways, into\r\n    national, state, and municipal bonds; into steamships and\r\n    steamboats and telegraphy; into real estate, into skyscrapers and\r\n    residences and hotels and business blocks; into life insurance,\r\n    into banking. There was soon literally no field of industry where\r\n    their millions were not at work. . . .\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rockefeller bank\xe2\x80\x94the National City Bank\xe2\x80\x94is by itself far and\r\n    away the biggest bank in the United States. It is exceeded in the\r\n    world only by the Bank of England and the Bank of France. The\r\n    deposits average more than one hundred millions a day; and it\r\n    dominates the call loan market on Wall Street and the stock market.\r\n    But it is not alone; it is the head of the Rockefeller chain of\r\n    banks, which includes fourteen banks and trust companies in New\r\n    York City, and banks of great strength and influence in every large\r\n    money center in the country.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cJohn D. Rockefeller owns Standard Oil stock worth between four and\r\n    five hundred millions at the market quotations. He has a hundred\r\n    millions in the steel trust, almost as much in a single western\r\n    railway system, half as much in a second, and so on and on and on\r\n    until the mind wearies of the cataloguing. His income last year was\r\n    about $100,000,000\xe2\x80\x94 it is doubtful if the incomes of all the\r\n    Rothschilds together make a greater sum. And it is going up by\r\n    leaps and bounds._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle discussion took place after this, and the dinner soon broke up.\r\nAll were quiet and subdued, and leave-taking was done with low voices.\r\nIt seemed almost that they were scared by the vision of the times they\r\nhad seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation is, indeed, serious,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin said to Ernest. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nlittle quarrel with the way you have depicted it. Only I disagree with\r\nyou about the doom of the middle class. We shall survive, and we shall\r\noverthrow the trusts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd return to the ways of your fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest finished for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Calvin answered gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of\r\nmachine-breaking, and that it is absurd. But then life seems absurd\r\nto-day, what of the machinations of the Plutocracy. And at any rate,\r\nour sort of machine-breaking is at least practical and possible, which\r\nyour dream is not. Your socialistic dream is . . . well, a dream. We\r\ncannot follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wish you fellows knew a little something about evolution and\r\nsociology,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said wistfully, as they shook hands. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would be\r\nsaved so much trouble if you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE VORTEX\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing like thunder claps upon the Business Men\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, occurred\r\nevent after event of terrifying moment; and I, little I, who had lived\r\nso placidly all my days in the quiet university town, found myself and\r\nmy personal affairs drawn into the vortex of the great world-affairs.\r\nWhether it was my love for Ernest, or the clear sight he had given me\r\nof the society in which I lived, that made me a revolutionist, I know\r\nnot; but a revolutionist I became, and I was plunged into a whirl of\r\nhappenings that would have been inconceivable three short months\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe crisis in my own fortunes came simultaneously with great crises in\r\nsociety. First of all, father was discharged from the university. Oh,\r\nhe was not technically discharged. His resignation was demanded, that\r\nwas all. This, in itself, did not amount to much. Father, in fact, was\r\ndelighted. He was especially delighted because his discharge had been\r\nprecipitated by the publication of his book, \xe2\x80\x9cEconomics and Education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIt clinched his argument, he contended. What better evidence could be\r\nadvanced to prove that education was dominated by the capitalist class?\r\n\r\nBut this proof never got anywhere. Nobody knew he had been forced to\r\nresign from the university. He was so eminent a scientist that such an\r\nannouncement, coupled with the reason for his enforced resignation,\r\nwould have created somewhat of a furor all over the world. The\r\nnewspapers showered him with praise and honor, and commended him for\r\nhaving given up the drudgery of the lecture room in order to devote his\r\nwhole time to scientific research.\r\n\r\nAt first father laughed. Then he became angry\xe2\x80\x94tonic angry. Then came\r\nthe suppression of his book. This suppression was performed secretly,\r\nso secretly that at first we could not comprehend. The publication of\r\nthe book had immediately caused a bit of excitement in the country.\r\nFather had been politely abused in the capitalist press, the tone of\r\nthe abuse being to the effect that it was a pity so great a scientist\r\nshould leave his field and invade the realm of sociology, about which\r\nhe knew nothing and wherein he had promptly become lost. This lasted\r\nfor a week, while father chuckled and said the book had touched a sore\r\nspot on capitalism. And then, abruptly, the newspapers and the critical\r\nmagazines ceased saying anything about the book at all. Also, and with\r\nequal suddenness, the book disappeared from the market. Not a copy was\r\nobtainable from any bookseller. Father wrote to the publishers and was\r\ninformed that the plates had been accidentally injured. An\r\nunsatisfactory correspondence followed. Driven finally to an\r\nunequivocal stand, the publishers stated that they could not see their\r\nway to putting the book into type again, but that they were willing to\r\nrelinquish their rights in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you won\xe2\x80\x99t find another publishing house in the country to touch\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I were you, I\xe2\x80\x99d hunt cover right now. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmerely got a foretaste of the Iron Heel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut father was nothing if not a scientist. He never believed in jumping\r\nto conclusions. A laboratory experiment was no experiment if it were\r\nnot carried through in all its details. So he patiently went the round\r\nof the publishing houses. They gave a multitude of excuses, but not one\r\nhouse would consider the book.\r\n\r\nWhen father became convinced that the book had actually been\r\nsuppressed, he tried to get the fact into the newspapers; but his\r\ncommunications were ignored. At a political meeting of the socialists,\r\nwhere many reporters were present, father saw his chance. He arose and\r\nrelated the history of the suppression of the book. He laughed next day\r\nwhen he read the newspapers, and then he grew angry to a degree that\r\neliminated all tonic qualities. The papers made no mention of the book,\r\nbut they misreported him beautifully. They twisted his words and\r\nphrases away from the context, and turned his subdued and controlled\r\nremarks into a howling anarchistic speech. It was done artfully. One\r\ninstance, in particular, I remember. He had used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csocial\r\nrevolution.\xe2\x80\x9d The reporter merely dropped out \xe2\x80\x9csocial.\xe2\x80\x9d This was sent\r\nout all over the country in an Associated Press despatch, and from all\r\nover the country arose a cry of alarm. Father was branded as a nihilist\r\nand an anarchist, and in one cartoon that was copied widely he was\r\nportrayed waving a red flag at the head of a mob of long-haired,\r\nwild-eyed men who bore in their hands torches, knives, and dynamite\r\nbombs.\r\n\r\nHe was assailed terribly in the press, in long and abusive editorials,\r\nfor his anarchy, and hints were made of mental breakdown on his part.\r\nThis behavior, on the part of the capitalist press, was nothing new,\r\nErnest told us. It was the custom, he said, to send reporters to all\r\nthe socialist meetings for the express purpose of misreporting and\r\ndistorting what was said, in order to frighten the middle class away\r\nfrom any possible affiliation with the proletariat. And repeatedly\r\nErnest warned father to cease fighting and to take to cover.\r\n\r\nThe socialist press of the country took up the fight, however, and\r\nthroughout the reading portion of the working class it was known that\r\nthe book had been suppressed. But this knowledge stopped with the\r\nworking class. Next, the \xe2\x80\x9cAppeal to Reason,\xe2\x80\x9d a big socialist publishing\r\nhouse, arranged with father to bring out the book. Father was jubilant,\r\nbut Ernest was alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you we are on the verge of the unknown,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cBig\r\nthings are happening secretly all around us. We can feel them. We do\r\nnot know what they are, but they are there. The whole fabric of society\r\nis a-tremble with them. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know myself. But out of\r\nthis flux of society something is about to crystallize. It is\r\ncrystallizing now. The suppression of the book is a precipitation. How\r\nmany books have been suppressed? We haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea. We are in\r\nthe dark. We have no way of learning. Watch out next for the\r\nsuppression of the socialist press and socialist publishing houses. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid it\xe2\x80\x99s coming. We are going to be throttled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest had his hand on the pulse of events even more closely than the\r\nrest of the socialists, and within two days the first blow was struck.\r\nThe _Appeal to Reason_ was a weekly, and its regular circulation\r\namongst the proletariat was seven hundred and fifty thousand. Also, it\r\nvery frequently got out special editions of from two to five millions.\r\nThese great editions were paid for and distributed by the small army of\r\nvoluntary workers who had marshalled around the _Appeal_. The first\r\nblow was aimed at these special editions, and it was a crushing one. By\r\nan arbitrary ruling of the Post Office, these editions were decided to\r\nbe not the regular circulation of the paper, and for that reason were\r\ndenied admission to the mails.\r\n\r\nA week later the Post Office Department ruled that the paper was\r\nseditious, and barred it entirely from the mails. This was a fearful\r\nblow to the socialist propaganda. The _Appeal_ was desperate. It\r\ndevised a plan of reaching its subscribers through the express\r\ncompanies, but they declined to handle it. This was the end of the\r\n_Appeal_. But not quite. It prepared to go on with its book publishing.\r\nTwenty thousand copies of father\xe2\x80\x99s book were in the bindery, and the\r\npresses were turning off more. And then, without warning, a mob arose\r\none night, and, under a waving American flag, singing patriotic songs,\r\nset fire to the great plant of the _Appeal_ and totally destroyed it.\r\n\r\nNow Girard, Kansas, was a quiet, peaceable town. There had never been\r\nany labor troubles there. The _Appeal_ paid union wages; and, in fact,\r\nwas the backbone of the town, giving employment to hundreds of men and\r\nwomen. It was not the citizens of Girard that composed the mob. This\r\nmob had risen up out of the earth apparently, and to all intents and\r\npurposes, its work done, it had gone back into the earth. Ernest saw in\r\nthe affair the most sinister import.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Black Hundreds[1] are being organized in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the beginning. There will be more of it. The Iron Heel\r\nis getting bold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] The Black Hundreds were reactionary mobs organized by the\r\n perishing Autocracy in the Russian Revolution. These reactionary\r\n groups attacked the revolutionary groups, and also, at needed moments,\r\n rioted and destroyed property so as to afford the Autocracy the\r\n pretext of calling out the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nAnd so perished father\xe2\x80\x99s book. We were to see much of the Black\r\nHundreds as the days went by. Week by week more of the socialist papers\r\nwere barred from the mails, and in a number of instances the Black\r\nHundreds destroyed the socialist presses. Of course, the newspapers of\r\nthe land lived up to the reactionary policy of the ruling class, and\r\nthe destroyed socialist press was misrepresented and vilified, while\r\nthe Black Hundreds were represented as true patriots and saviours of\r\nsociety. So convincing was all this misrepresentation that even sincere\r\nministers in the pulpit praised the Black Hundreds while regretting the\r\nnecessity of violence.\r\n\r\nHistory was making fast. The fall elections were soon to occur, and\r\nErnest was nominated by the socialist party to run for Congress. His\r\nchance for election was most favorable. The street-car strike in San\r\nFrancisco had been broken. And following upon it the teamsters\xe2\x80\x99 strike\r\nhad been broken. These two defeats had been very disastrous to\r\norganized labor. The whole Water Front Federation, along with its\r\nallies in the structural trades, had backed up the teamsters, and all\r\nhad been smashed down ingloriously. It had been a bloody strike. The\r\npolice had broken countless heads with their riot clubs; and the death\r\nlist had been augmented by the turning loose of a machine-gun on the\r\nstrikers from the barns of the Marsden Special Delivery Company.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, the men were sullen and vindictive. They wanted blood,\r\nand revenge. Beaten on their chosen field, they were ripe to seek\r\nrevenge by means of political action. They still maintained their labor\r\norganization, and this gave them strength in the political struggle\r\nthat was on. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s chance for election grew stronger and stronger.\r\nDay by day unions and more unions voted their support to the\r\nsocialists, until even Ernest laughed when the Undertakers\xe2\x80\x99 Assistants\r\nand the Chicken Pickers fell into line. Labor became mulish. While it\r\npacked the socialist meetings with mad enthusiasm, it was impervious to\r\nthe wiles of the old-party politicians. The old-party orators were\r\nusually greeted with empty halls, though occasionally they encountered\r\nfull halls where they were so roughly handled that more than once it\r\nwas necessary to call out the police reserves.\r\n\r\nHistory was making fast. The air was vibrant with things happening and\r\nimpending. The country was on the verge of hard times,[2] caused by a\r\nseries of prosperous years wherein the difficulty of disposing abroad\r\nof the unconsumed surplus had become increasingly difficult. Industries\r\nwere working short time; many great factories were standing idle\r\nagainst the time when the surplus should be gone; and wages were being\r\ncut right and left.\r\n\r\n [2] Under the capitalist r\xc3\xa9gime these periods of hard times were as\r\n inevitable as they were absurd. Prosperity always brought calamity.\r\n This, of course, was due to the excess of unconsumed profits that was\r\n piled up.\r\n\r\nAlso, the great machinist strike had been broken. Two hundred thousand\r\nmachinists, along with their five hundred thousand allies in the\r\nmetalworking trades, had been defeated in as bloody a strike as had\r\never marred the United States. Pitched battles had been fought with the\r\nsmall armies of armed strike-breakers[3] put in the field by the\r\nemployers\xe2\x80\x99 associations; the Black Hundreds, appearing in scores of\r\nwide-scattered places, had destroyed property; and, in consequence, a\r\nhundred thousand regular soldiers of the United States had been called\r\nout to put a frightful end to the whole affair. A number of the labor\r\nleaders had been executed; many others had been sentenced to prison,\r\nwhile thousands of the rank and file of the strikers had been herded\r\ninto bull-pens[4] and abominably treated by the soldiers.\r\n\r\n [3] _Strike-breakers_\xe2\x80\x94these were, in purpose and practice and\r\n everything except name, the private soldiers of the capitalists. They\r\n were thoroughly organized and well armed, and they were held in\r\n readiness to be hurled in special trains to any part of the country\r\n where labor went on strike or was locked out by the employers. Only\r\n those curious times could have given rise to the amazing spectacle of\r\n one, Farley, a notorious commander of strike-breakers, who, in 1906,\r\n swept across the United States in special trains from New York to San\r\n Francisco with an army of twenty-five hundred men, fully armed and\r\n equipped, to break a strike of the San Francisco street-car men. Such\r\n an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land. The fact that\r\n this act, and thousands of similar acts, went unpunished, goes to show\r\n how completely the judiciary was the creature of the Plutocracy.\r\n\r\n [4] _Bull-pen_\xe2\x80\x94in a miners\xe2\x80\x99 strike in Idaho, in the latter part of the\r\n nineteenth century, it happened that many of the strikers were\r\n confined in a bull-pen by the troops. The practice and the name\r\n continued in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe years of prosperity were now to be paid for. All markets were\r\nglutted; all markets were falling; and amidst the general crumble of\r\nprices the price of labor crumbled fastest of all. The land was\r\nconvulsed with industrial dissensions. Labor was striking here, there,\r\nand everywhere; and where it was not striking, it was being turned out\r\nby the capitalists. The papers were filled with tales of violence and\r\nblood. And through it all the Black Hundreds played their part. Riot,\r\narson, and wanton destruction of property was their function, and well\r\nthey performed it. The whole regular army was in the field, called\r\nthere by the actions of the Black Hundreds.[5] All cities and towns\r\nwere like armed camps, and laborers were shot down like dogs. Out of\r\nthe vast army of the unemployed the strike-breakers were recruited; and\r\nwhen the strike-breakers were worsted by the labor unions, the troops\r\nalways appeared and crushed the unions. Then there was the militia. As\r\nyet, it was not necessary to have recourse to the secret militia law.\r\nOnly the regularly organized militia was out, and it was out\r\neverywhere. And in this time of terror, the regular army was increased\r\nan additional hundred thousand by the government.\r\n\r\n [5] The name only, and not the idea, was imported from Russia. The\r\n Black Hundreds were a development out of the secret agents of the\r\n capitalists, and their use arose in the labor struggles of the\r\n nineteenth century. There is no discussion of this. No less an\r\n authority of the times than Carroll D. Wright, United States\r\n Commissioner of Labor, is responsible for the statement. From his\r\n book, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Battles of Labor,\xe2\x80\x9d is quoted the declaration that\r\n \xe2\x80\x9c_in some of the great historic strikes the employers themselves have\r\n instigated acts of violence;_\xe2\x80\x9d that manufacturers have deliberately\r\n provoked strikes in order to get rid of surplus stock; and that\r\n freight cars have been burned by employers\xe2\x80\x99 agents during railroad\r\n strikes in order to increase disorder. It was out of these secret\r\n agents of the employers that the Black Hundreds arose; and it was\r\n they, in turn, that later became that terrible weapon of the\r\n Oligarchy, the agents-provocateurs.\r\n\r\nNever had labor received such an all-around beating. The great captains\r\nof industry, the oligarchs, had for the first time thrown their full\r\nweight into the breach the struggling employers\xe2\x80\x99 associations had made.\r\nThese associations were practically middle-class affairs, and now,\r\ncompelled by hard times and crashing markets, and aided by the great\r\ncaptains of industry, they gave organized labor an awful and decisive\r\ndefeat. It was an all-powerful alliance, but it was an alliance of the\r\nlion and the lamb, as the middle class was soon to learn.\r\n\r\nLabor was bloody and sullen, but crushed. Yet its defeat did not put an\r\nend to the hard times. The banks, themselves constituting one of the\r\nmost important forces of the Oligarchy, continued to call in credits.\r\nThe Wall Street[6] group turned the stock market into a maelstrom where\r\nthe values of all the land crumbled away almost to nothingness. And out\r\nof all the rack and ruin rose the form of the nascent Oligarchy,\r\nimperturbable, indifferent, and sure. Its serenity and certitude was\r\nterrifying. Not only did it use its own vast power, but it used all the\r\npower of the United States Treasury to carry out its plans.\r\n\r\n [6] _Wall Street_\xe2\x80\x94so named from a street in ancient New York, where\r\n was situated the stock exchange, and where the irrational organization\r\n of society permitted underhanded manipulation of all the industries of\r\n the country.\r\n\r\nThe captains of industry had turned upon the middle class. The\r\nemployers\xe2\x80\x99 associations, that had helped the captains of industry to\r\ntear and rend labor, were now torn and rent by their quondam allies.\r\nAmidst the crashing of the middle men, the small business men and\r\nmanufacturers, the trusts stood firm. Nay, the trusts did more than\r\nstand firm. They were active. They sowed wind, and wind, and ever more\r\nwind; for they alone knew how to reap the whirlwind and make a profit\r\nout of it. And such profits! Colossal profits! Strong enough themselves\r\nto weather the storm that was largely their own brewing, they turned\r\nloose and plundered the wrecks that floated about them. Values were\r\npitifully and inconceivably shrunken, and the trusts added hugely to\r\ntheir holdings, even extending their enterprises into many new\r\nfields\xe2\x80\x94and always at the expense of the middle class.\r\n\r\nThus the summer of 1912 witnessed the virtual death-thrust to the\r\nmiddle class. Even Ernest was astounded at the quickness with which it\r\nhad been done. He shook his head ominously and looked forward without\r\nhope to the fall elections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are beaten. The Iron Heel is here. I had\r\nhoped for a peaceable victory at the ballot-box. I was wrong. Wickson\r\nwas right. We shall be robbed of our few remaining liberties; the Iron\r\nHeel will walk upon our faces; nothing remains but a bloody revolution\r\nof the working class. Of course we will win, but I shudder to think of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd from then on Ernest pinned his faith in revolution. In this he was\r\nin advance of his party. His fellow-socialists could not agree with\r\nhim. They still insisted that victory could be gained through the\r\nelections. It was not that they were stunned. They were too cool-headed\r\nand courageous for that. They were merely incredulous, that was all.\r\nErnest could not get them seriously to fear the coming of the\r\nOligarchy. They were stirred by him, but they were too sure of their\r\nown strength. There was no room in their theoretical social evolution\r\nfor an oligarchy, therefore the Oligarchy could not be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll send you to Congress and it will be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d they told him at\r\none of our secret meetings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when they take me out of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest replied coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nput me against a wall, and blow my brains out\xe2\x80\x94what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll rise in our might,\xe2\x80\x9d a dozen voices answered at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll welter in your gore,\xe2\x80\x9d was his retort. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that\r\nsong sung by the middle class, and where is it now in its might?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE GREAT ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wickson did not send for father. They met by chance on the\r\nferry-boat to San Francisco, so that the warning he gave father was not\r\npremeditated. Had they not met accidentally, there would not have been\r\nany warning. Not that the outcome would have been different, however.\r\nFather came of stout old _Mayflower_[1] stock, and the blood was\r\nimperative in him.\r\n\r\n [1] One of the first ships that carried colonies to America, after the\r\n discovery of the New World. Descendants of these original colonists\r\n were for a while inordinately proud of their genealogy; but in time\r\n the blood became so widely diffused that it ran in the veins\r\n practically of all Americans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cErnest was right,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, as soon as he had returned home.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cErnest is a very remarkable young man, and I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see you his wife\r\nthan the wife of Rockefeller himself or the King of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Oligarchy is about to tread upon our faces\xe2\x80\x94yours and mine. Wickson\r\nas much as told me so. He was very kind\xe2\x80\x94for an oligarch. He offered to\r\nreinstate me in the university. What do you think of that? He, Wickson,\r\na sordid money-grabber, has the power to determine whether I shall or\r\nshall not teach in the university of the state. But he offered me even\r\nbetter than that\xe2\x80\x94offered to make me president of some great college of\r\nphysical sciences that is being planned\xe2\x80\x94the Oligarchy must get rid of\r\nits surplus somehow, you see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember what I told that socialist lover of your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x98I told him that we would walk upon the faces of the working\r\nclass. And so we shall. As for you, I have for you a deep respect as a\r\nscientist; but if you throw your fortunes in with the working\r\nclass\xe2\x80\x94well, watch out for your face, that is all.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he turned\r\nand left me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to marry earlier than you planned,\xe2\x80\x9d was Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomment when we told him.\r\n\r\nI could not follow his reasoning, but I was soon to learn it. It was at\r\nthis time that the quarterly dividend of the Sierra Mills was paid\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nrather, should have been paid, for father did not receive his. After\r\nwaiting several days, father wrote to the secretary. Promptly came the\r\nreply that there was no record on the books of father\xe2\x80\x99s owning any\r\nstock, and a polite request for more explicit information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make it explicit enough, confound him,\xe2\x80\x9d father declared, and\r\ndeparted for the bank to get the stock in question from his\r\nsafe-deposit box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cErnest is a very remarkable man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when he got back and while I\r\nwas helping him off with his overcoat. \xe2\x80\x9cI repeat, my daughter, that\r\nyoung man of yours is a very remarkable young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had learned, whenever he praised Ernest in such fashion, to expect\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have already walked upon my face,\xe2\x80\x9d father explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was\r\nno stock. The box was empty. You and Ernest will have to get married\r\npretty quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather insisted on laboratory methods. He brought the Sierra Mills into\r\ncourt, but he could not bring the books of the Sierra Mills into court.\r\nHe did not control the courts, and the Sierra Mills did. That explained\r\nit all. He was thoroughly beaten by the law, and the bare-faced robbery\r\nheld good.\r\n\r\nIt is almost laughable now, when I look back on it, the way father was\r\nbeaten. He met Wickson accidentally on the street in San Francisco, and\r\nhe told Wickson that he was a damned scoundrel. And then father was\r\narrested for attempted assault, fined in the police court, and bound\r\nover to keep the peace. It was all so ridiculous that when he got home\r\nhe had to laugh himself. But what a furor was raised in the local\r\npapers! There was grave talk about the bacillus of violence that\r\ninfected all men who embraced socialism; and father, with his long and\r\npeaceful life, was instanced as a shining example of how the bacillus\r\nof violence worked. Also, it was asserted by more than one paper that\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mind had weakened under the strain of scientific study, and\r\nconfinement in a state asylum for the insane was suggested. Nor was\r\nthis merely talk. It was an imminent peril. But father was wise enough\r\nto see it. He had the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s experience to lesson from, and he\r\nlessoned well. He kept quiet no matter what injustice was perpetrated\r\non him, and really, I think, surprised his enemies.\r\n\r\nThere was the matter of the house\xe2\x80\x94our home. A mortgage was foreclosed\r\non it, and we had to give up possession. Of course there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nmortgage, and never had been any mortgage. The ground had been bought\r\noutright, and the house had been paid for when it was built. And house\r\nand lot had always been free and unencumbered. Nevertheless there was\r\nthe mortgage, properly and legally drawn up and signed, with a record\r\nof the payments of interest through a number of years. Father made no\r\noutcry. As he had been robbed of his money, so was he now robbed of his\r\nhome. And he had no recourse. The machinery of society was in the hands\r\nof those who were bent on breaking him. He was a philosopher at heart,\r\nand he was no longer even angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am doomed to be broken,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is no reason that\r\nI should not try to be shattered as little as possible. These old bones\r\nof mine are fragile, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned my lesson. God knows I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto spend my last days in an insane asylum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me of Bishop Morehouse, whom I have neglected for many\r\npages. But first let me tell of my marriage. In the play of events, my\r\nmarriage sinks into insignificance, I know, so I shall barely mention\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we shall become real proletarians,\xe2\x80\x9d father said, when we were\r\ndriven from our home. \xe2\x80\x9cI have often envied that young man of yours for\r\nhis actual knowledge of the proletariat. Now I shall see and learn for\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather must have had strong in him the blood of adventure. He looked\r\nupon our catastrophe in the light of an adventure. No anger nor\r\nbitterness possessed him. He was too philosophic and simple to be\r\nvindictive, and he lived too much in the world of mind to miss the\r\ncreature comforts we were giving up. So it was, when we moved to San\r\nFrancisco into four wretched rooms in the slum south of Market Street,\r\nthat he embarked upon the adventure with the joy and enthusiasm of a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94combined with the clear sight and mental grasp of an\r\nextraordinary intellect. He really never crystallized mentally. He had\r\nno false sense of values. Conventional or habitual values meant nothing\r\nto him. The only values he recognized were mathematical and scientific\r\nfacts. My father was a great man. He had the mind and the soul that\r\nonly great men have. In ways he was even greater than Ernest, than whom\r\nI have known none greater.\r\n\r\nEven I found some relief in our change of living. If nothing else, I\r\nwas escaping from the organized ostracism that had been our increasing\r\nportion in the university town ever since the enmity of the nascent\r\nOligarchy had been incurred. And the change was to me likewise\r\nadventure, and the greatest of all, for it was love-adventure. The\r\nchange in our fortunes had hastened my marriage, and it was as a wife\r\nthat I came to live in the four rooms on Pell Street, in the San\r\nFrancisco slum.\r\n\r\nAnd this out of all remains: I made Ernest happy. I came into his\r\nstormy life, not as a new perturbing force, but as one that made toward\r\npeace and repose. I gave him rest. It was the guerdon of my love for\r\nhim. It was the one infallible token that I had not failed. To bring\r\nforgetfulness, or the light of gladness, into those poor tired eyes of\r\nhis\xe2\x80\x94what greater joy could have blessed me than that?\r\n\r\nThose dear tired eyes. He toiled as few men ever toiled, and all his\r\nlifetime he toiled for others. That was the measure of his manhood. He\r\nwas a humanist and a lover. And he, with his incarnate spirit of\r\nbattle, his gladiator body and his eagle spirit\xe2\x80\x94he was as gentle and\r\ntender to me as a poet. He was a poet. A singer in deeds. And all his\r\nlife he sang the song of man. And he did it out of sheer love of man,\r\nand for man he gave his life and was crucified.\r\n\r\nAnd all this he did with no hope of future reward. In his conception of\r\nthings there was no future life. He, who fairly burnt with immortality,\r\ndenied himself immortality\xe2\x80\x94such was the paradox of him. He, so warm in\r\nspirit, was dominated by that cold and forbidding philosophy,\r\nmaterialistic monism. I used to refute him by telling him that I\r\nmeasured his immortality by the wings of his soul, and that I should\r\nhave to live endless aeons in order to achieve the full measurement.\r\nWhereat he would laugh, and his arms would leap out to me, and he would\r\ncall me his sweet metaphysician; and the tiredness would pass out of\r\nhis eyes, and into them would flood the happy love-light that was in\r\nitself a new and sufficient advertisement of his immortality.\r\n\r\nAlso, he used to call me his dualist, and he would explain how Kant, by\r\nmeans of pure reason, had abolished reason, in order to worship God.\r\nAnd he drew the parallel and included me guilty of a similar act. And\r\nwhen I pleaded guilty, but defended the act as highly rational, he but\r\npressed me closer and laughed as only one of God\xe2\x80\x99s own lovers could\r\nlaugh. I was wont to deny that heredity and environment could explain\r\nhis own originality and genius, any more than could the cold groping\r\nfinger of science catch and analyze and classify that elusive essence\r\nthat lurked in the constitution of life itself.\r\n\r\nI held that space was an apparition of God, and that soul was a\r\nprojection of the character of God; and when he called me his sweet\r\nmetaphysician, I called him my immortal materialist. And so we loved\r\nand were happy; and I forgave him his materialism because of his\r\ntremendous work in the world, performed without thought of soul-gain\r\nthereby, and because of his so exceeding modesty of spirit that\r\nprevented him from having pride and regal consciousness of himself and\r\nhis soul.\r\n\r\nBut he had pride. How could he have been an eagle and not have pride?\r\nHis contention was that it was finer for a finite mortal speck of life\r\nto feel Godlike, than for a god to feel godlike; and so it was that he\r\nexalted what he deemed his mortality. He was fond of quoting a fragment\r\nfrom a certain poem. He had never seen the whole poem, and he had tried\r\nvainly to learn its authorship. I here give the fragment, not alone\r\nbecause he loved it, but because it epitomized the paradox that he was\r\nin the spirit of him, and his conception of his spirit. For how can a\r\nman, with thrilling, and burning, and exaltation, recite the following\r\nand still be mere mortal earth, a bit of fugitive force, an evanescent\r\nform? Here it is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoy upon joy and gain upon gain\r\nAre the destined rights of my birth,\r\nAnd I shout the praise of my endless days\r\nTo the echoing edge of the earth.\r\nThough I suffer all deaths that a man can die\r\nTo the uttermost end of time,\r\nI have deep-drained this, my cup of bliss,\r\nIn every age and clime\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe froth of Pride, the tang of Power,\r\nThe sweet of Womanhood!\r\nI drain the lees upon my knees,\r\nFor oh, the draught is good;\r\nI drink to Life, I drink to Death,\r\nAnd smack my lips with song,\r\nFor when I die, another \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99 shall pass the cup along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man you drove from Eden\xe2\x80\x99s grove\r\n    Was I, my Lord, was I,\r\nAnd I shall be there when the earth and the air\r\n    Are rent from sea to sky;\r\nFor it is my world, my gorgeous world,\r\n    The world of my dearest woes,\r\nFrom the first faint cry of the newborn\r\n    To the rack of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s throes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPacked with the pulse of an unborn race,\r\nTorn with a world\xe2\x80\x99s desire,\r\nThe surging flood of my wild young blood\r\nWould quench the judgment fire.\r\nI am Man, Man, Man, from the tingling flesh\r\nTo the dust of my earthly goal,\r\nFrom the nestling gloom of the pregnant womb\r\nTo the sheen of my naked soul.\r\nBone of my bone and flesh of my flesh\r\nThe whole world leaps to my will,\r\nAnd the unslaked thirst of an Eden cursed\r\nShall harrow the earth for its fill.\r\nAlmighty God, when I drain life\xe2\x80\x99s glass\r\nOf all its rainbow gleams,\r\nThe hapless plight of eternal night\r\nShall be none too long for my dreams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man you drove from Eden\xe2\x80\x99s grove\r\n    Was I, my Lord, was I,\r\nAnd I shall be there when the earth and the air\r\n    Are rent from sea to sky;\r\nFor it is my world, my gorgeous world,\r\n    The world of my dear delight,\r\nFrom the brightest gleam of the Arctic stream\r\n    To the dusk of my own love-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest always overworked. His wonderful constitution kept him up; but\r\neven that constitution could not keep the tired look out of his eyes.\r\nHis dear, tired eyes! He never slept more than four and one-half hours\r\na night; yet he never found time to do all the work he wanted to do. He\r\nnever ceased from his activities as a propagandist, and was always\r\nscheduled long in advance for lectures to workingmen\xe2\x80\x99s organizations.\r\nThen there was the campaign. He did a man\xe2\x80\x99s full work in that alone.\r\nWith the suppression of the socialist publishing houses, his meagre\r\nroyalties ceased, and he was hard-put to make a living; for he had to\r\nmake a living in addition to all his other labor. He did a great deal\r\nof translating for the magazines on scientific and philosophic\r\nsubjects; and, coming home late at night, worn out from the strain of\r\nthe campaign, he would plunge into his translating and toil on well\r\ninto the morning hours. And in addition to everything, there was his\r\nstudying. To the day of his death he kept up his studies, and he\r\nstudied prodigiously.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he found time in which to love me and make me happy. But this\r\nwas accomplished only through my merging my life completely into his. I\r\nlearned shorthand and typewriting, and became his secretary. He\r\ninsisted that I succeeded in cutting his work in half; and so it was\r\nthat I schooled myself to understand his work. Our interests became\r\nmutual, and we worked together and played together.\r\n\r\nAnd then there were our sweet stolen moments in the midst of our\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94just a word, or caress, or flash of love-light; and our moments\r\nwere sweeter for being stolen. For we lived on the heights, where the\r\nair was keen and sparkling, where the toil was for humanity, and where\r\nsordidness and selfishness never entered. We loved love, and our love\r\nwas never smirched by anything less than the best. And this out of all\r\nremains: I did not fail. I gave him rest\xe2\x80\x94he who worked so hard for\r\nothers, my dear, tired-eyed mortalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE BISHOP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after my marriage that I chanced upon Bishop Morehouse. But I\r\nmust give the events in their proper sequence. After his outbreak at\r\nthe I. P. H. Convention, the Bishop, being a gentle soul, had yielded\r\nto the friendly pressure brought to bear upon him, and had gone away on\r\na vacation. But he returned more fixed than ever in his determination\r\nto preach the message of the Church. To the consternation of his\r\ncongregation, his first sermon was quite similar to the address he had\r\ngiven before the Convention. Again he said, and at length and with\r\ndistressing detail, that the Church had wandered away from the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nteaching, and that Mammon had been instated in the place of Christ.\r\n\r\nAnd the result was, willy-nilly, that he was led away to a private\r\nsanitarium for mental disease, while in the newspapers appeared\r\npathetic accounts of his mental breakdown and of the saintliness of his\r\ncharacter. He was held a prisoner in the sanitarium. I called\r\nrepeatedly, but was denied access to him; and I was terribly impressed\r\nby the tragedy of a sane, normal, saintly man being crushed by the\r\nbrutal will of society. For the Bishop was sane, and pure, and noble.\r\nAs Ernest said, all that was the matter with him was that he had\r\nincorrect notions of biology and sociology, and because of his\r\nincorrect notions he had not gone about it in the right way to rectify\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nWhat terrified me was the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s helplessness. If he persisted in the\r\ntruth as he saw it, he was doomed to an insane ward. And he could do\r\nnothing. His money, his position, his culture, could not save him. His\r\nviews were perilous to society, and society could not conceive that\r\nsuch perilous views could be the product of a sane mind. Or, at least,\r\nit seems to me that such was society\xe2\x80\x99s attitude.\r\n\r\nBut the Bishop, in spite of the gentleness and purity of his spirit,\r\nwas possessed of guile. He apprehended clearly his danger. He saw\r\nhimself caught in the web, and he tried to escape from it. Denied help\r\nfrom his friends, such as father and Ernest and I could have given, he\r\nwas left to battle for himself alone. And in the enforced solitude of\r\nthe sanitarium he recovered. He became again sane. His eyes ceased to\r\nsee visions; his brain was purged of the fancy that it was the duty of\r\nsociety to feed the Master\xe2\x80\x99s lambs.\r\n\r\nAs I say, he became well, quite well, and the newspapers and the church\r\npeople hailed his return with joy. I went once to his church. The\r\nsermon was of the same order as the ones he had preached long before\r\nhis eyes had seen visions. I was disappointed, shocked. Had society\r\nthen beaten him into submission? Was he a coward? Had he been bulldozed\r\ninto recanting? Or had the strain been too great for him, and had he\r\nmeekly surrendered to the juggernaut of the established?\r\n\r\nI called upon him in his beautiful home. He was woefully changed. He\r\nwas thinner, and there were lines on his face which I had never seen\r\nbefore. He was manifestly distressed by my coming. He plucked nervously\r\nat his sleeve as we talked; and his eyes were restless, fluttering\r\nhere, there, and everywhere, and refusing to meet mine. His mind seemed\r\npreoccupied, and there were strange pauses in his conversation, abrupt\r\nchanges of topic, and an inconsecutiveness that was bewildering. Could\r\nthis, then, be the firm-poised, Christ-like man I had known, with pure,\r\nlimpid eyes and a gaze steady and unfaltering as his soul? He had been\r\nman-handled; he had been cowed into subjection. His spirit was too\r\ngentle. It had not been mighty enough to face the organized wolf-pack\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nI felt sad, unutterably sad. He talked ambiguously, and was so\r\napprehensive of what I might say that I had not the heart to catechise\r\nhim. He spoke in a far-away manner of his illness, and we talked\r\ndisjointedly about the church, the alterations in the organ, and about\r\npetty charities; and he saw me depart with such evident relief that I\r\nshould have laughed had not my heart been so full of tears.\r\n\r\nThe poor little hero! If I had only known! He was battling like a\r\ngiant, and I did not guess it. Alone, all alone, in the midst of\r\nmillions of his fellow-men, he was fighting his fight. Torn by his\r\nhorror of the asylum and his fidelity to truth and the right, he clung\r\nsteadfastly to truth and the right; but so alone was he that he did not\r\ndare to trust even me. He had learned his lesson well\xe2\x80\x94too well.\r\n\r\nBut I was soon to know. One day the Bishop disappeared. He had told\r\nnobody that he was going away; and as the days went by and he did not\r\nreappear, there was much gossip to the effect that he had committed\r\nsuicide while temporarily deranged. But this idea was dispelled when it\r\nwas learned that he had sold all his possessions,\xe2\x80\x94his city mansion, his\r\ncountry house at Menlo Park, his paintings, and collections, and even\r\nhis cherished library. It was patent that he had made a clean and\r\nsecret sweep of everything before he disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis happened during the time when calamity had overtaken us in our own\r\naffairs; and it was not till we were well settled in our new home that\r\nwe had opportunity really to wonder and speculate about the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoings. And then, everything was suddenly made clear. Early one\r\nevening, while it was yet twilight, I had run across the street and\r\ninto the butcher-shop to get some chops for Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s supper. We called\r\nthe last meal of the day \xe2\x80\x9csupper\xe2\x80\x9d in our new environment.\r\n\r\nJust at the moment I came out of the butcher-shop, a man emerged from\r\nthe corner grocery that stood alongside. A queer sense of familiarity\r\nmade me look again. But the man had turned and was walking rapidly\r\naway. There was something about the slope of the shoulders and the\r\nfringe of silver hair between coat collar and slouch hat that aroused\r\nvague memories. Instead of crossing the street, I hurried after the\r\nman. I quickened my pace, trying not to think the thoughts that formed\r\nunbidden in my brain. No, it was impossible. It could not be\xe2\x80\x94not in\r\nthose faded overalls, too long in the legs and frayed at the bottoms.\r\n\r\nI paused, laughed at myself, and almost abandoned the chase. But the\r\nhaunting familiarity of those shoulders and that silver hair! Again I\r\nhurried on. As I passed him, I shot a keen look at his face; then I\r\nwhirled around abruptly and confronted\xe2\x80\x94the Bishop.\r\n\r\nHe halted with equal abruptness, and gasped. A large paper bag in his\r\nright hand fell to the sidewalk. It burst, and about his feet and mine\r\nbounced and rolled a flood of potatoes. He looked at me with surprise\r\nand alarm, then he seemed to wilt away; the shoulders drooped with\r\ndejection, and he uttered a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nI held out my hand. He shook it, but his hand felt clammy. He cleared\r\nhis throat in embarrassment, and I could see the sweat starting out on\r\nhis forehead. It was evident that he was badly frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe potatoes,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are precious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween us we picked them up and replaced them in the broken bag, which\r\nhe now held carefully in the hollow of his arm. I tried to tell him my\r\ngladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather will be rejoiced to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe live only a stone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthrow away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be going. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked apprehensively about him, as though dreading discovery, and\r\nmade an attempt to walk on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me where you live, and I shall call later,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when he saw\r\nthat I walked beside him and that it was my intention to stick to him\r\nnow that he was found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must come now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the potatoes spilling on his arm, and at the small parcels\r\non his other arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, it is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me for my rudeness. If\r\nyou only knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he were going to break down, but the next moment he had\r\nhimself in control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, this food,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sad case. It is terrible.\r\nShe is an old woman. I must take it to her at once. She is suffering\r\nfrom want of it. I must go at once. You understand. Then I will return.\r\nI promise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go with you,\xe2\x80\x9d I volunteered. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sighed again, and surrendered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly two blocks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us hasten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s guidance I learned something of my own neighborhood.\r\nI had not dreamed such wretchedness and misery existed in it. Of\r\ncourse, this was because I did not concern myself with charity. I had\r\nbecome convinced that Ernest was right when he sneered at charity as a\r\npoulticing of an ulcer. Remove the ulcer, was his remedy; give to the\r\nworker his product; pension as soldiers those who grow honorably old in\r\ntheir toil, and there will be no need for charity. Convinced of this, I\r\ntoiled with him at the revolution, and did not exhaust my energy in\r\nalleviating the social ills that continuously arose from the injustice\r\nof the system.\r\n\r\nI followed the Bishop into a small room, ten by twelve, in a rear\r\ntenement. And there we found a little old German woman\xe2\x80\x94sixty-four years\r\nold, the Bishop said. She was surprised at seeing me, but she nodded a\r\npleasant greeting and went on sewing on the pair of men\xe2\x80\x99s trousers in\r\nher lap. Beside her, on the floor, was a pile of trousers. The Bishop\r\ndiscovered there was neither coal nor kindling, and went out to buy\r\nsome.\r\n\r\nI took up a pair of trousers and examined her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix cents, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, nodding her head gently while she went on\r\nstitching. She stitched slowly, but never did she cease from stitching.\r\nShe seemed mastered by the verb \xe2\x80\x9cto stitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that work?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what they pay? How long does it\r\ntake you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is what they pay. Six cents for finishing.\r\nTwo hours\xe2\x80\x99 sewing on each pair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the boss doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that,\xe2\x80\x9d she added quickly, betraying a fear\r\nof getting him into trouble. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m slow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the rheumatism in my\r\nhands. Girls work much faster. They finish in half that time. The boss\r\nis kind. He lets me take the work home, now that I am old and the noise\r\nof the machine bothers my head. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for his kindness, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstarve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, those who work in the shop get eight cents. But what can you do?\r\nThere is not enough work for the young. The old have no chance. Often\r\none pair is all I can get. Sometimes, like to-day, I am given eight\r\npair to finish before night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked her the hours she worked, and she said it depended on the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the summer, when there is a rush order, I work from five in the\r\nmorning to nine at night. But in the winter it is too cold. The hands\r\ndo not early get over the stiffness. Then you must work later\xe2\x80\x94till\r\nafter midnight sometimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it has been a bad summer. The hard times. God must be angry. This\r\nis the first work the boss has given me in a week. It is true, one\r\ncannot eat much when there is no work. I am used to it. I have sewed\r\nall my life, in the old country and here in San Francisco\xe2\x80\x94thirty-three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are sure of the rent, it is all right. The houseman is very\r\nkind, but he must have his rent. It is fair. He only charges three\r\ndollars for this room. That is cheap. But it is not easy for you to\r\nfind all of three dollars every month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ceased talking, and, nodding her head, went on stitching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be very careful as to how you spend your earnings,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nShe nodded emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the rent it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad. Of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy meat. And\r\nthere is no milk for the coffee. But always there is one meal a day,\r\nand often two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said this last proudly. There was a smack of success in her words.\r\nBut as she stitched on in silence, I noticed the sadness in her\r\npleasant eyes and the droop of her mouth. The look in her eyes became\r\nfar away. She rubbed the dimness hastily out of them; it interfered\r\nwith her stitching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not the hunger that makes the heart ache,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get used to being hungry. It is for my child that I cry. It was\r\nthe machine that killed her. It is true she worked hard, but I cannot\r\nunderstand. She was strong. And she was young\xe2\x80\x94only forty; and she\r\nworked only thirty years. She began young, it is true; but my man died.\r\nThe boiler exploded down at the works. And what were we to do? She was\r\nten, but she was very strong. But the machine killed her. Yes, it did.\r\nIt killed her, and she was the fastest worker in the shop. I have\r\nthought about it often, and I know. That is why I cannot work in the\r\nshop. The machine bothers my head. Always I hear it saying, \xe2\x80\x98I did it,\r\nI did it.\xe2\x80\x99 And it says that all day long. And then I think of my\r\ndaughter, and I cannot work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moistness was in her old eyes again, and she had to wipe it away\r\nbefore she could go on stitching.\r\n\r\nI heard the Bishop stumbling up the stairs, and I opened the door. What\r\na spectacle he was. On his back he carried half a sack of coal, with\r\nkindling on top. Some of the coal dust had coated his face, and the\r\nsweat from his exertions was running in streaks. He dropped his burden\r\nin the corner by the stove and wiped his face on a coarse bandana\r\nhandkerchief. I could scarcely accept the verdict of my senses. The\r\nBishop, black as a coal-heaver, in a workingman\xe2\x80\x99s cheap cotton shirt\r\n(one button was missing from the throat), and in overalls! That was the\r\nmost incongruous of all\xe2\x80\x94the overalls, frayed at the bottoms, dragged\r\ndown at the heels, and held up by a narrow leather belt around the hips\r\nsuch as laborers wear.\r\n\r\nThough the Bishop was warm, the poor swollen hands of the old woman\r\nwere already cramping with the cold; and before we left her, the Bishop\r\nhad built the fire, while I had peeled the potatoes and put them on to\r\nboil. I was to learn, as time went by, that there were many cases\r\nsimilar to hers, and many worse, hidden away in the monstrous depths of\r\nthe tenements in my neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe got back to find Ernest alarmed by my absence. After the first\r\nsurprise of greeting was over, the Bishop leaned back in his chair,\r\nstretched out his overall-covered legs, and actually sighed a\r\ncomfortable sigh. We were the first of his old friends he had met since\r\nhis disappearance, he told us; and during the intervening weeks he must\r\nhave suffered greatly from loneliness. He told us much, though he told\r\nus more of the joy he had experienced in doing the Master\xe2\x80\x99s bidding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor truly now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am feeding his lambs. And I have learned a\r\ngreat lesson. The soul cannot be ministered to till the stomach is\r\nappeased. His lambs must be fed bread and butter and potatoes and meat;\r\nafter that, and only after that, are their spirits ready for more\r\nrefined nourishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ate heartily of the supper I cooked. Never had he had such an\r\nappetite at our table in the old days. We spoke of it, and he said that\r\nhe had never been so healthy in his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walk always now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and a blush was on his cheek at the\r\nthought of the time when he rode in his carriage, as though it were a\r\nsin not lightly to be laid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy health is better for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am very\r\nhappy\xe2\x80\x94indeed, most happy. At last I am a consecrated spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was in his face a permanent pain, the pain of the world\r\nthat he was now taking to himself. He was seeing life in the raw, and\r\nit was a different life from what he had known within the printed books\r\nof his library.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are responsible for all this, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said directly to\r\nErnest.\r\n\r\nErnest was embarrassed and awkward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I warned you,\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you misunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI speak not in reproach,\r\nbut in gratitude. I have you to thank for showing me my path. You led\r\nme from theories about life to life itself. You pulled aside the veils\r\nfrom the social shams. You were light in my darkness, but now I, too,\r\nsee the light. And I am very happy, only . . .\xe2\x80\x9d he hesitated painfully,\r\nand in his eyes fear leaped large. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the persecution. I harm no\r\none. Why will they not let me alone? But it is not that. It is the\r\nnature of the persecution. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if they cut my flesh with\r\nstripes, or burned me at the stake, or crucified me head-downward. But\r\nit is the asylum that frightens me. Think of it! Of me\xe2\x80\x94in an asylum for\r\nthe insane! It is revolting. I saw some of the cases at the sanitarium.\r\nThey were violent. My blood chills when I think of it. And to be\r\nimprisoned for the rest of my life amid scenes of screaming madness!\r\nNo! no! Not that! Not that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was pitiful. His hands shook, his whole body quivered and shrank\r\naway from the picture he had conjured. But the next moment he was calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my wretched nerves. And if the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s work leads there, so be it. Who am I to complain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt like crying aloud as I looked at him: \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Bishop! O hero!\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s hero!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the evening wore on we learned more of his doings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sold my house\xe2\x80\x94my houses, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9call my other\r\npossessions. I knew I must do it secretly, else they would have taken\r\neverything away from me. That would have been terrible. I often marvel\r\nthese days at the immense quantity of potatoes two or three hundred\r\nthousand dollars will buy, or bread, or meat, or coal and kindling.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned to Ernest. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, young man. Labor is dreadfully\r\nunderpaid. I never did a bit of work in my life, except to appeal\r\naesthetically to Pharisees\xe2\x80\x94I thought I was preaching the message\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyet I was worth half a million dollars. I never knew what half a\r\nmillion dollars meant until I realized how much potatoes and bread and\r\nbutter and meat it could buy. And then I realized something more. I\r\nrealized that all those potatoes and that bread and butter and meat\r\nwere mine, and that I had not worked to make them. Then it was clear to\r\nme, some one else had worked and made them and been robbed of them. And\r\nwhen I came down amongst the poor I found those who had been robbed and\r\nwho were hungry and wretched because they had been robbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe drew him back to his narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money? I have it deposited in many different banks under different\r\nnames. It can never be taken away from me, because it can never be\r\nfound. And it is so good, that money. It buys so much food. I never\r\nknew before what money was good for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could get some of it for the propaganda,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said\r\nwistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would do immense good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop said. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not have much faith in\r\npolitics. In fact, I am afraid I do not understand politics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was delicate in such matters. He did not repeat his suggestion,\r\nthough he knew only too well the sore straits the Socialist Party was\r\nin through lack of money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sleep in cheap lodging houses,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bishop went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am\r\nafraid, and never stay long in one place. Also, I rent two rooms in\r\nworkingmen\xe2\x80\x99s houses in different quarters of the city. It is a great\r\nextravagance, I know, but it is necessary. I make up for it in part by\r\ndoing my own cooking, though sometimes I get something to eat in cheap\r\ncoffee-houses. And I have made a discovery. Tamales[1] are very good\r\nwhen the air grows chilly late at night. Only they are so expensive.\r\nBut I have discovered a place where I can get three for ten cents. They\r\nare not so good as the others, but they are very warming.\r\n\r\n [1] A Mexican dish, referred to occasionally in the literature of the\r\n times. It is supposed that it was warmly seasoned. No recipe of it has\r\n come down to us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I have at last found my work in the world, thanks to you, young\r\nman. It is the Master\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at me, and his eyes twinkled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou caught me feeding his lambs, you know. And of course you will all\r\nkeep my secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke carelessly enough, but there was real fear behind the speech.\r\nHe promised to call upon us again. But a week later we read in the\r\nnewspaper of the sad case of Bishop Morehouse, who had been committed\r\nto the Napa Asylum and for whom there were still hopes held out. In\r\nvain we tried to see him, to have his case reconsidered or\r\ninvestigated. Nor could we learn anything about him except the\r\nreiterated statements that slight hopes were still held for his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist told the rich young man to sell all he had,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said\r\nbitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bishop obeyed Christ\xe2\x80\x99s injunction and got locked up in a\r\nmadhouse. Times have changed since Christ\xe2\x80\x99s day. A rich man to-day who\r\ngives all he has to the poor is crazy. There is no discussion. Society\r\nhas spoken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nTHE GENERAL STRIKE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Ernest was elected to Congress in the great socialist\r\nlandslide that took place in the fall of 1912. One great factor that\r\nhelped to swell the socialist vote was the destruction of Hearst.[1]\r\nThis the Plutocracy found an easy task. It cost Hearst eighteen million\r\ndollars a year to run his various papers, and this sum, and more, he\r\ngot back from the middle class in payment for advertising. The source\r\nof his financial strength lay wholly in the middle class. The trusts\r\ndid not advertise.[2] To destroy Hearst, all that was necessary was to\r\ntake away from him his advertising.\r\n\r\n [1] _William Randolph Hearst_\xe2\x80\x94a young California millionaire who\r\n became the most powerful newspaper owner in the country. His\r\n newspapers were published in all the large cities, and they appealed\r\n to the perishing middle class and to the proletariat. So large was his\r\n following that he managed to take possession of the empty shell of the\r\n old Democratic Party. He occupied an anomalous position, preaching an\r\n emasculated socialism combined with a nondescript sort of petty\r\n bourgeois capitalism. It was oil and water, and there was no hope for\r\n him, though for a short period he was a source of serious apprehension\r\n to the Plutocrats.\r\n\r\n [2] The cost of advertising was amazing in those helter- skelter\r\n times. Only the small capitalists competed, and therefore they did the\r\n advertising. There being no competition where there was a trust, there\r\n was no need for the trusts to advertise.\r\n\r\nThe whole middle class had not yet been exterminated. The sturdy\r\nskeleton of it remained; but it was without power. The small\r\nmanufacturers and small business men who still survived were at the\r\ncomplete mercy of the Plutocracy. They had no economic nor political\r\nsouls of their own. When the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth, they\r\nwithdrew their advertisements from the Hearst papers.\r\n\r\nHearst made a gallant fight. He brought his papers out at a loss of a\r\nmillion and a half each month. He continued to publish the\r\nadvertisements for which he no longer received pay. Again the fiat of\r\nthe Plutocracy went forth, and the small business men and manufacturers\r\nswamped him with a flood of notices that he must discontinue running\r\ntheir old advertisements. Hearst persisted. Injunctions were served on\r\nhim. Still he persisted. He received six months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for\r\ncontempt of court in disobeying the injunctions, while he was\r\nbankrupted by countless damage suits. He had no chance. The Plutocracy\r\nhad passed sentence on him. The courts were in the hands of the\r\nPlutocracy to carry the sentence out. And with Hearst crashed also to\r\ndestruction the Democratic Party that he had so recently captured.\r\n\r\nWith the destruction of Hearst and the Democratic Party, there were\r\nonly two paths for his following to take. One was into the Socialist\r\nParty; the other was into the Republican Party. Then it was that we\r\nsocialists reaped the fruit of Hearst\xe2\x80\x99s pseudo-socialistic preaching;\r\nfor the great Majority of his followers came over to us.\r\n\r\nThe expropriation of the farmers that took place at this time would\r\nalso have swelled our vote had it not been for the brief and futile\r\nrise of the Grange Party. Ernest and the socialist leaders fought\r\nfiercely to capture the farmers; but the destruction of the socialist\r\npress and publishing houses constituted too great a handicap, while the\r\nmouth-to-mouth propaganda had not yet been perfected. So it was that\r\npoliticians like Mr. Calvin, who were themselves farmers long since\r\nexpropriated, captured the farmers and threw their political strength\r\naway in a vain campaign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor farmers,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest once laughed savagely; \xe2\x80\x9cthe trusts have them\r\nboth coming and going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd that was really the situation. The seven great trusts, working\r\ntogether, had pooled their enormous surpluses and made a farm trust.\r\nThe railroads, controlling rates, and the bankers and stock exchange\r\ngamesters, controlling prices, had long since bled the farmers into\r\nindebtedness. The bankers, and all the trusts for that matter, had\r\nlikewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers.\r\nThe farmers were in the net. All that remained to be done was the\r\ndrawing in of the net. This the farm trust proceeded to do.\r\n\r\nThe hard times of 1912 had already caused a frightful slump in the farm\r\nmarkets. Prices were now deliberately pressed down to bankruptcy, while\r\nthe railroads, with extortionate rates, broke the back of the\r\nfarmer-camel. Thus the farmers were compelled to borrow more and more,\r\nwhile they were prevented from paying back old loans. Then ensued the\r\ngreat foreclosing of mortgages and enforced collection of notes. The\r\nfarmers simply surrendered the land to the farm trust. There was\r\nnothing else for them to do. And having surrendered the land, the\r\nfarmers next went to work for the farm trust, becoming managers,\r\nsuperintendents, foremen, and common laborers. They worked for wages.\r\nThey became villeins, in short\xe2\x80\x94serfs bound to the soil by a living\r\nwage. They could not leave their masters, for their masters composed\r\nthe Plutocracy. They could not go to the cities, for there, also, the\r\nPlutocracy was in control. They had but one alternative,\xe2\x80\x94to leave the\r\nsoil and become vagrants, in brief, to starve. And even there they were\r\nfrustrated, for stringent vagrancy laws were passed and rigidly\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nOf course, here and there, farmers, and even whole communities of\r\nfarmers, escaped expropriation by virtue of exceptional conditions. But\r\nthey were merely strays and did not count, and they were gathered in\r\nanyway during the following year.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] The destruction of the Roman yeomanry proceeded far less rapidly\r\n than the destruction of the American farmers and small capitalists.\r\n There was momentum in the twentieth century, while there was\r\n practically none in ancient Rome.\r\n    Numbers of the farmers, impelled by an insane lust for the soil,\r\n    and willing to show what beasts they could become, tried to escape\r\n    expropriation by withdrawing from any and all market-dealing. They\r\n    sold nothing. They bought nothing. Among themselves a primitive\r\n    barter began to spring up. Their privation and hardships were\r\n    terrible, but they persisted. It became quite a movement, in fact.\r\n    The manner in which they were beaten was unique and logical and\r\n    simple. The Plutocracy, by virtue of its possession of the\r\n    government, raised their taxes. It was the weak joint in their\r\n    armor. Neither buying nor selling, they had no money, and in the\r\n    end their land was sold to pay the taxes.\r\n\r\nThus it was that in the fall of 1912 the socialist leaders, with the\r\nexception of Ernest, decided that the end of capitalism had come. What\r\nof the hard times and the consequent vast army of the unemployed; what\r\nof the destruction of the farmers and the middle class; and what of the\r\ndecisive defeat administered all along the line to the labor unions;\r\nthe socialists were really justified in believing that the end of\r\ncapitalism had come and in themselves throwing down the gauntlet to the\r\nPlutocracy.\r\n\r\nAlas, how we underestimated the strength of the enemy! Everywhere the\r\nsocialists proclaimed their coming victory at the ballot-box, while, in\r\nunmistakable terms, they stated the situation. The Plutocracy accepted\r\nthe challenge. It was the Plutocracy, weighing and balancing, that\r\ndefeated us by dividing our strength. It was the Plutocracy, through\r\nits secret agents, that raised the cry that socialism was sacrilegious\r\nand atheistic; it was the Plutocracy that whipped the churches, and\r\nespecially the Catholic Church, into line, and robbed us of a portion\r\nof the labor vote. And it was the Plutocracy, through its secret agents\r\nof course, that encouraged the Grange Party and even spread it to the\r\ncities into the ranks of the dying middle class.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the socialist landslide occurred. But, instead of a\r\nsweeping victory with chief executive officers and majorities in all\r\nlegislative bodies, we found ourselves in the minority. It is true, we\r\nelected fifty Congressmen; but when they took their seats in the spring\r\nof 1913, they found themselves without power of any sort. Yet they were\r\nmore fortunate than the Grangers, who captured a dozen state\r\ngovernments, and who, in the spring, were not permitted to take\r\npossession of the captured offices. The incumbents refused to retire,\r\nand the courts were in the hands of the Oligarchy. But this is too far\r\nin advance of events. I have yet to tell of the stirring times of the\r\nwinter of 1912.\r\n\r\nThe hard times at home had caused an immense decrease in consumption.\r\nLabor, out of work, had no wages with which to buy. The result was that\r\nthe Plutocracy found a greater surplus than ever on its hands. This\r\nsurplus it was compelled to dispose of abroad, and, what of its\r\ncolossal plans, it needed money. Because of its strenuous efforts to\r\ndispose of the surplus in the world market, the Plutocracy clashed with\r\nGermany. Economic clashes were usually succeeded by wars, and this\r\nparticular clash was no exception. The great German war-lord prepared,\r\nand so did the United States prepare.\r\n\r\nThe war-cloud hovered dark and ominous. The stage was set for a\r\nworld-catastrophe, for in all the world were hard times, labor\r\ntroubles, perishing middle classes, armies of unemployed, clashes of\r\neconomic interests in the world-market, and mutterings and rumblings of\r\nthe socialist revolution.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] For a long time these mutterings and rumblings had been heard. As\r\n far back as 1906 A.D., Lord Avebury, an Englishman, uttered the\r\n following in the House of Lords: \xe2\x80\x9c_The unrest in Europe, the spread of\r\n socialism, and the ominous rise of Anarchism, are warnings to the\r\n governments and the ruling classes that the condition of the working\r\n classes in Europe is becoming intolerable, and that if a revolution is\r\n to be avoided some steps must be taken to increase wages, reduce the\r\n hours of labor, and lower the prices of the necessaries of life._\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\n _Wall Street Journal_, a stock gamesters\xe2\x80\x99 publication, in commenting\r\n upon Lord Avebury\xe2\x80\x99s speech, said: \xe2\x80\x9c_These words were spoken by an\r\n aristocrat and a member of the most conservative body in all Europe.\r\n That gives them all the more significance. They contain more valuable\r\n political economy than is to be found in most of the books. They sound\r\n a note of warning. Take heed, gentlemen of the war and navy\r\n departments!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    At the same time, Sydney Brooks, writing in America, in Harper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    Weekly, said: \xe2\x80\x9c_You will not hear the socialists mentioned in\r\n    Washington. Why should you? The politicians are always the last\r\n    people in this country to see what is going on under their noses.\r\n    They will jeer at me when I prophesy, and prophesy with the utmost\r\n    confidence, that at the next presidential election the socialists\r\n    will poll over a million votes._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Oligarchy wanted the war with Germany. And it wanted the war for a\r\ndozen reasons. In the juggling of events such a war would cause, in the\r\nreshuffling of the international cards and the making of new treaties\r\nand alliances, the Oligarchy had much to gain. And, furthermore, the\r\nwar would consume many national surpluses, reduce the armies of\r\nunemployed that menaced all countries, and give the Oligarchy a\r\nbreathing space in which to perfect its plans and carry them out. Such\r\na war would virtually put the Oligarchy in possession of the\r\nworld-market. Also, such a war would create a large standing army that\r\nneed never be disbanded, while in the minds of the people would be\r\nsubstituted the issue, \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica _versus_ Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d in place of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSocialism _versus_ Oligarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd truly the war would have done all these things had it not been for\r\nthe socialists. A secret meeting of the Western leaders was held in our\r\nfour tiny rooms in Pell Street. Here was first considered the stand the\r\nsocialists were to take. It was not the first time we had put our foot\r\ndown upon war,[5] but it was the first time we had done so in the\r\nUnited States. After our secret meeting we got in touch with the\r\nnational organization, and soon our code cables were passing back and\r\nforth across the Atlantic between us and the International Bureau.\r\n\r\n [5] It was at the very beginning of the twentieth century A.D., that\r\n the international organization of the socialists finally formulated\r\n their long-maturing policy on war. Epitomized their doctrine was:\r\n \xe2\x80\x9c_Why should the workingmen of one country fight with the workingmen\r\n of another country for the benefit of their capitalist masters?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    On May 21, 1905 A.D., when war threatened between Austria and\r\n    Italy, the socialists of Italy, Austria, and Hungary held a\r\n    conference at Trieste, and threatened a general strike of the\r\n    workingmen of both countries in case war was declared. This was\r\n    repeated the following year, when the \xe2\x80\x9cMorocco Affair\xe2\x80\x9d threatened\r\n    to involve France, Germany, and England.\r\n\r\nThe German socialists were ready to act with us. There were over five\r\nmillion of them, many of them in the standing army, and, in addition,\r\nthey were on friendly terms with the labor unions. In both countries\r\nthe socialists came out in bold declaration against the war and\r\nthreatened the general strike. And in the meantime they made\r\npreparation for the general strike. Furthermore, the revolutionary\r\nparties in all countries gave public utterance to the socialist\r\nprinciple of international peace that must be preserved at all hazards,\r\neven to the extent of revolt and revolution at home.\r\n\r\nThe general strike was the one great victory we American socialists\r\nwon. On the 4th of December the American minister was withdrawn from\r\nthe German capital. That night a German fleet made a dash on Honolulu,\r\nsinking three American cruisers and a revenue cutter, and bombarding\r\nthe city. Next day both Germany and the United States declared war, and\r\nwithin an hour the socialists called the general strike in both\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the German war-lord faced the men of his empire who\r\nmade his empire go. Without them he could not run his empire. The\r\nnovelty of the situation lay in that their revolt was passive. They did\r\nnot fight. They did nothing. And by doing nothing they tied their\r\nwar-lord\xe2\x80\x99s hands. He would have asked for nothing better than an\r\nopportunity to loose his war-dogs on his rebellious proletariat. But\r\nthis was denied him. He could not loose his war-dogs. Neither could he\r\nmobilize his army to go forth to war, nor could he punish his\r\nrecalcitrant subjects. Not a wheel moved in his empire. Not a train\r\nran, not a telegraphic message went over the wires, for the\r\ntelegraphers and railroad men had ceased work along with the rest of\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\nAnd as it was in Germany, so it was in the United States. At last\r\norganized labor had learned its lesson. Beaten decisively on its own\r\nchosen field, it had abandoned that field and come over to the\r\npolitical field of the socialists; for the general strike was a\r\npolitical strike. Besides, organized labor had been so badly beaten\r\nthat it did not care. It joined in the general strike out of sheer\r\ndesperation. The workers threw down their tools and left their tasks by\r\nthe millions. Especially notable were the machinists. Their heads were\r\nbloody, their organization had apparently been destroyed, yet out they\r\ncame, along with their allies in the metal-working trades.\r\n\r\nEven the common laborers and all unorganized labor ceased work. The\r\nstrike had tied everything up so that nobody could work. Besides, the\r\nwomen proved to be the strongest promoters of the strike. They set\r\ntheir faces against the war. They did not want their men to go forth to\r\ndie. Then, also, the idea of the general strike caught the mood of the\r\npeople. It struck their sense of humor. The idea was infectious. The\r\nchildren struck in all the schools, and such teachers as came, went\r\nhome again from deserted class rooms. The general strike took the form\r\nof a great national picnic. And the idea of the solidarity of labor, so\r\nevidenced, appealed to the imagination of all. And, finally, there was\r\nno danger to be incurred by the colossal frolic. When everybody was\r\nguilty, how was anybody to be punished?\r\n\r\nThe United States was paralyzed. No one knew what was happening. There\r\nwere no newspapers, no letters, no despatches. Every community was as\r\ncompletely isolated as though ten thousand miles of primeval wilderness\r\nstretched between it and the rest of the world. For that matter, the\r\nworld had ceased to exist. And for a week this state of affairs was\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nIn San Francisco we did not know what was happening even across the bay\r\nin Oakland or Berkeley. The effect on one\xe2\x80\x99s sensibilities was weird,\r\ndepressing. It seemed as though some great cosmic thing lay dead. The\r\npulse of the land had ceased to beat. Of a truth the nation had died.\r\nThere were no wagons rumbling on the streets, no factory whistles, no\r\nhum of electricity in the air, no passing of street cars, no cries of\r\nnews-boys\xe2\x80\x94nothing but persons who at rare intervals went by like\r\nfurtive ghosts, themselves oppressed and made unreal by the silence.\r\n\r\nAnd during that week of silence the Oligarchy was taught its lesson.\r\nAnd well it learned the lesson. The general strike was a warning. It\r\nshould never occur again. The Oligarchy would see to that.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week, as had been prearranged, the telegraphers of\r\nGermany and the United States returned to their posts. Through them the\r\nsocialist leaders of both countries presented their ultimatum to the\r\nrulers. The war should be called off, or the general strike would\r\ncontinue. It did not take long to come to an understanding. The war was\r\ndeclared off, and the populations of both countries returned to their\r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nIt was this renewal of peace that brought about the alliance between\r\nGermany and the United States. In reality, this was an alliance between\r\nthe Emperor and the Oligarchy, for the purpose of meeting their common\r\nfoe, the revolutionary proletariat of both countries. And it was this\r\nalliance that the Oligarchy afterward so treacherously broke when the\r\nGerman socialists rose and drove the war-lord from his throne. It was\r\nthe very thing the Oligarchy had played for\xe2\x80\x94the destruction of its\r\ngreat rival in the world-market. With the German Emperor out of the\r\nway, Germany would have no surplus to sell abroad. By the very nature\r\nof the socialist state, the German population would consume all that it\r\nproduced. Of course, it would trade abroad certain things it produced\r\nfor things it did not produce; but this would be quite different from\r\nan unconsumable surplus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wager the Oligarchy finds justification,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said, when its\r\ntreachery to the German Emperor became known. \xe2\x80\x9cAs usual, the Oligarchy\r\nwill believe it has done right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough. The Oligarchy\xe2\x80\x99s public defence for the act was that it\r\nhad done it for the sake of the American people whose interests it was\r\nlooking out for. It had flung its hated rival out of the world-market\r\nand enabled us to dispose of our surplus in that market.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the howling folly of it is that we are so helpless that such\r\nidiots really are managing our interests,\xe2\x80\x9d was Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nhave enabled us to sell more abroad, which means that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ncompelled to consume less at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE END\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as January, 1913, Ernest saw the true trend of affairs, but he\r\ncould not get his brother leaders to see the vision of the Iron Heel\r\nthat had arisen in his brain. They were too confident. Events were\r\nrushing too rapidly to culmination. A crisis had come in world affairs.\r\nThe American Oligarchy was practically in possession of the\r\nworld-market, and scores of countries were flung out of that market\r\nwith unconsumable and unsalable surpluses on their hands. For such\r\ncountries nothing remained but reorganization. They could not continue\r\ntheir method of producing surpluses. The capitalistic system, so far as\r\nthey were concerned, had hopelessly broken down.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution. It\r\nwas a time of confusion and violence. Everywhere institutions and\r\ngovernments were crashing. Everywhere, with the exception of two or\r\nthree countries, the erstwhile capitalist masters fought bitterly for\r\ntheir possessions. But the governments were taken away from them by the\r\nmilitant proletariat. At last was being realized Karl Marx\xe2\x80\x99s classic:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe knell of private capitalist property sounds. The expropriators are\r\nexpropriated.\xe2\x80\x9d And as fast as capitalistic governments crashed,\r\ncooperative commonwealths arose in their place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does the United States lag behind?\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cGet busy, you American\r\nrevolutionists!\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with America?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94were the messages\r\nsent to us by our successful comrades in other lands. But we could not\r\nkeep up. The Oligarchy stood in the way. Its bulk, like that of some\r\nhuge monster, blocked our path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till we take office in the spring,\xe2\x80\x9d we answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBehind this lay our secret. We had won over the Grangers, and in the\r\nspring a dozen states would pass into their hands by virtue of the\r\nelections of the preceding fall. At once would be instituted a dozen\r\ncooperative commonwealth states. After that, the rest would be easy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if the Grangers fail to get possession?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest demanded. And\r\nhis comrades called him a calamity howler.\r\n\r\nBut this failure to get possession was not the chief danger that Ernest\r\nhad in mind. What he foresaw was the defection of the great labor\r\nunions and the rise of the castes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGhent has taught the oligarchs how to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wager\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve made a text-book out of his \xe2\x80\x98Benevolent Feudalism.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9cOur Benevolent Feudalism,\xe2\x80\x9d a book published in 1902 A.D., by W.\r\n J. Ghent. It has always been insisted that Ghent put the idea of the\r\n Oligarchy into the minds of the great capitalists. This belief\r\n persists throughout the literature of the three centuries of the Iron\r\n Heel, and even in the literature of the first century of the\r\n Brotherhood of Man. To-day we know better, but our knowledge does not\r\n overcome the fact that Ghent remains the most abused innocent man in\r\n all history.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget the night when, after a hot discussion with half a\r\ndozen labor leaders, Ernest turned to me and said quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nsettles it. The Iron Heel has won. The end is in sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis little conference in our home was unofficial; but Ernest, like the\r\nrest of his comrades, was working for assurances from the labor leaders\r\nthat they would call out their men in the next general strike.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor, the president of the Association of Machinists, had been\r\nforemost of the six leaders present in refusing to give such assurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen that you were beaten soundly at your old tactics of\r\nstrike and boycott,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest urged.\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor and the others nodded their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you saw what a general strike would do,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nstopped the war with Germany. Never was there so fine a display of the\r\nsolidarity and the power of labor. Labor can and will rule the world.\r\nIf you continue to stand with us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll put an end to the reign of\r\ncapitalism. It is your only hope. And what is more, you know it. There\r\nis no other way out. No matter what you do under your old tactics, you\r\nare doomed to defeat, if for no other reason because the masters\r\ncontrol the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d[2]\r\n\r\n [2] As a sample of the decisions of the courts adverse to labor, the\r\n following instances are given. In the coal- mining regions the\r\n employment of children was notorious. In 1905 A.D., labor succeeded in\r\n getting a law passed in Pennsylvania providing that proof of the age\r\n of the child and of certain educational qualifications must accompany\r\n the oath of the parent. This was promptly declared unconstitutional by\r\n the Luzerne County Court, on the ground that it violated the\r\n Fourteenth Amendment in that it discriminated between individuals of\r\n the same class\xe2\x80\x94namely, children above fourteen years of age and\r\n children below. The state court sustained the decision. The New York\r\n Court of Special Sessions, in 1905 A.D., declared unconstitutional the\r\n law prohibiting minors and women from working in factories after nine\r\n o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, the ground taken being that such a law was \xe2\x80\x9cclass\r\n legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d Again, the bakers of that time were terribly overworked.\r\n The New York Legislature passed a law restricting work in bakeries to\r\n ten hours a day. In 1906 A.D., the Supreme Court of the United States\r\n declared this law to be unconstitutional. In part the decision read:\r\n \xe2\x80\x9c_There is no reasonable ground for interfering with the liberty of\r\n persons or the right of free contract by determining the hours of\r\n labor in the occupation of a baker._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou run ahead too fast,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Connor answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the\r\nways out. There is another way out. We know what we\xe2\x80\x99re about. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsick of strikes. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got us beaten that way to a frazzle. But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll ever need to call our men out again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your way out?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest demanded bluntly.\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor laughed and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you this much: We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnot been asleep. And we\xe2\x80\x99re not dreaming now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be afraid of, or ashamed of, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest\r\nchallenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess we know our business best,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dark business, from the way you hide it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said with\r\ngrowing anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve paid for our experience in sweat and blood, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve earned all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s coming to us,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cCharity begins at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid to tell me your way out, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s blood was up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going in for grab-sharing. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\nterms with the enemy, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done. You\xe2\x80\x99ve sold out the\r\ncause of labor, of all labor. You are leaving the battle-field like\r\ncowards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying anything,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Connor answered sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I guess we\r\nknow what\xe2\x80\x99s best for us a little bit better than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t care a cent for what is best for the rest of labor. You\r\nkick it into the ditch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying anything,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Connor replied, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that I\xe2\x80\x99m president\r\nof the Machinists\xe2\x80\x99 Association, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my business to consider the\r\ninterests of the men I represent, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the labor leaders had left, Ernest, with the calmness of\r\ndefeat, outlined to me the course of events to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe socialists used to foretell with joy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe coming of the\r\nday when organized labor, defeated on the industrial field, would come\r\nover on to the political field. Well, the Iron Heel has defeated the\r\nlabor unions on the industrial field and driven them over to the\r\npolitical field; and instead of this being joyful for us, it will be a\r\nsource of grief. The Iron Heel learned its lesson. We showed it our\r\npower in the general strike. It has taken steps to prevent another\r\ngeneral strike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply by subsidizing the great unions. They won\xe2\x80\x99t join in the next\r\ngeneral strike. Therefore it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a general strike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Iron Heel can\xe2\x80\x99t maintain so costly a programme forever,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nobjected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t subsidized all of the unions. That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary. Here\r\nis what is going to happen. Wages are going to be advanced and hours\r\nshortened in the railroad unions, the iron and steel workers unions,\r\nand the engineer and machinist unions. In these unions more favorable\r\nconditions will continue to prevail. Membership in these unions will\r\nbecome like seats in Paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill I don\xe2\x80\x99t see,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to become of the other\r\nunions? There are far more unions outside of this combination than in\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other unions will be ground out of existence\xe2\x80\x94all of them. For,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, the railway men, machinists and engineers, iron and\r\nsteel workers, do all of the vitally essential work in our machine\r\ncivilization. Assured of their faithfulness, the Iron Heel can snap its\r\nfingers at all the rest of labor. Iron, steel, coal, machinery, and\r\ntransportation constitute the backbone of the whole industrial fabric.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut coal?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are nearly a million coal miners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey are practically unskilled labor. They will not count. Their wages\r\nwill go down and their hours will increase. They will be slaves like\r\nall the rest of us, and they will become about the most bestial of all\r\nof us. They will be compelled to work, just as the farmers are\r\ncompelled to work now for the masters who robbed them of their land.\r\nAnd the same with all the other unions outside the combination. Watch\r\nthem wobble and go to pieces, and their members become slaves driven to\r\ntoil by empty stomachs and the law of the land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what will happen to Farley[3] and his strike-breakers?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Strike-breaking as an occupation will cease. There won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe any more strikes. In place of strikes will be slave revolts. Farley\r\nand his gang will be promoted to slave-driving. Oh, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be called\r\nthat; it will be called enforcing the law of the land that compels the\r\nlaborers to work. It simply prolongs the fight, this treachery of the\r\nbig unions. Heaven only knows now where and when the Revolution will\r\ntriumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [3] James Farley\xe2\x80\x94a notorious strike-breaker of the period. A man more\r\n courageous than ethical, and of undeniable ability. He rose high under\r\n the rule of the Iron Heel and finally was translated into the oligarch\r\n class. He was assassinated in 1932 by Sarah Jenkins, whose husband,\r\n thirty years before, had been killed by Farley\xe2\x80\x99s strike-breakers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with such a powerful combination as the Oligarchy and the big\r\nunions, is there any reason to believe that the Revolution will ever\r\ntriumph?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried. \xe2\x80\x9cMay not the combination endure forever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of our generalizations is that every system\r\nfounded upon class and caste contains within itself the germs of its\r\nown decay. When a system is founded upon class, how can caste be\r\nprevented? The Iron Heel will not be able to prevent it, and in the end\r\ncaste will destroy the Iron Heel. The oligarchs have already developed\r\ncaste among themselves; but wait until the favored unions develop\r\ncaste. The Iron Heel will use all its power to prevent it, but it will\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the favored unions are the flower of the American workingmen. They\r\nare strong, efficient men. They have become members of those unions\r\nthrough competition for place. Every fit workman in the United States\r\nwill be possessed by the ambition to become a member of the favored\r\nunions. The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent\r\ncompetition. Thus will the strong men, who might else be\r\nrevolutionists, be won away and their strength used to bolster the\r\nOligarchy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, the labor castes, the members of the favored\r\nunions, will strive to make their organizations into close\r\ncorporations. And they will succeed. Membership in the labor castes\r\nwill become hereditary. Sons will succeed fathers, and there will be no\r\ninflow of new strength from that eternal reservoir of strength, the\r\ncommon people. This will mean deterioration of the labor castes, and in\r\nthe end they will become weaker and weaker. At the same time, as an\r\ninstitution, they will become temporarily all-powerful. They will be\r\nlike the guards of the palace in old Rome, and there will be palace\r\nrevolutions whereby the labor castes will seize the reins of power. And\r\nthere will be counter-palace revolutions of the oligarchs, and\r\nsometimes the one, and sometimes the other, will be in power. And\r\nthrough it all the inevitable caste-weakening will go on, so that in\r\nthe end the common people will come into their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis foreshadowing of a slow social evolution was made when Ernest was\r\nfirst depressed by the defection of the great unions. I never agreed\r\nwith him in it, and I disagree now, as I write these lines, more\r\nheartily than ever; for even now, though Ernest is gone, we are on the\r\nverge of the revolt that will sweep all oligarchies away. Yet I have\r\nhere given Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy because it was his prophecy. In spite of\r\nhis belief in it, he worked like a giant against it, and he, more than\r\nany man, has made possible the revolt that even now waits the signal to\r\nburst forth.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s social foresight was remarkable. As clearly as in the\r\n light of past events, he saw the defection of the favored unions, the\r\n rise and the slow decay of the labor castes, and the struggle between\r\n the decaying oligarchs and labor castes for control of the great\r\n governmental machine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if the Oligarchy persists,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him that evening, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will\r\nbecome of the great surpluses that will fall to its share every year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe surpluses will have to be expended somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ntrust the oligarchs to find a way. Magnificent roads will be built.\r\nThere will be great achievements in science, and especially in art.\r\nWhen the oligarchs have completely mastered the people, they will have\r\ntime to spare for other things. They will become worshippers of beauty.\r\nThey will become art-lovers. And under their direction and generously\r\nrewarded, will toil the artists. The result will be great art; for no\r\nlonger, as up to yesterday, will the artists pander to the bourgeois\r\ntaste of the middle class. It will be great art, I tell you, and wonder\r\ncities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old\r\ntime. And in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship\r\nbeauty.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] We cannot but marvel at Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s foresight. Before ever the\r\n thought of wonder cities like Ardis and Asgard entered the minds of\r\n the oligarchs, Everhard saw those cities and the inevitable necessity\r\n for their creation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus will the surplus be constantly expended while labor does the\r\nwork. The building of these great works and cities will give a\r\nstarvation ration to millions of common laborers, for the enormous bulk\r\nof the surplus will compel an equally enormous expenditure, and the\r\noligarchs will build for a thousand years\xe2\x80\x94ay, for ten thousand years.\r\nThey will build as the Egyptians and the Babylonians never dreamed of\r\nbuilding; and when the oligarchs have passed away, their great roads\r\nand their wonder cities will remain for the brotherhood of labor to\r\ntread upon and dwell within.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] And since that day of prophecy, have passed away the three\r\n centuries of the Iron Heel and the four centuries of the Brotherhood\r\n of Man, and to-day we tread the roads and dwell in the cities that the\r\n oligarchs built. It is true, we are even now building still more\r\n wonderful wonder cities, but the wonder cities of the oligarchs\r\n endure, and I write these lines in Ardis, one of the most wonderful of\r\n them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese things the oligarchs will do because they cannot help doing\r\nthem. These great works will be the form their expenditure of the\r\nsurplus will take, and in the same way that the ruling classes of Egypt\r\nof long ago expended the surplus they robbed from the people by the\r\nbuilding of temples and pyramids. Under the oligarchs will flourish,\r\nnot a priest class, but an artist class. And in place of the merchant\r\nclass of bourgeoisie will be the labor castes. And beneath will be the\r\nabyss, wherein will fester and starve and rot, and ever renew itself,\r\nthe common people, the great bulk of the population. And in the end,\r\nwho knows in what day, the common people will rise up out of the abyss;\r\nthe labor castes and the Oligarchy will crumble away; and then, at\r\nlast, after the travail of the centuries, will it be the day of the\r\ncommon man. I had thought to see that day; but now I know that I shall\r\nnever see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at me, and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSocial evolution is exasperatingly slow, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, sweetheart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy arms were about him, and his head was on my breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing me to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured whimsically. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a visioning,\r\nand I wish to forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nLAST DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was near the end of January, 1913, that the changed attitude of the\r\nOligarchy toward the favored unions was made public. The newspapers\r\npublished information of an unprecedented rise in wages and shortening\r\nof hours for the railroad employees, the iron and steel workers, and\r\nthe engineers and machinists. But the whole truth was not told. The\r\noligarchs did not dare permit the telling of the whole truth. In\r\nreality, the wages had been raised much higher, and the privileges were\r\ncorrespondingly greater. All this was secret, but secrets will out.\r\nMembers of the favored unions told their wives, and the wives gossiped,\r\nand soon all the labor world knew what had happened.\r\n\r\nIt was merely the logical development of what in the nineteenth century\r\nhad been known as grab-sharing. In the industrial warfare of that time,\r\nprofit-sharing had been tried. That is, the capitalists had striven to\r\nplacate the workers by interesting them financially in their work. But\r\nprofit-sharing, as a system, was ridiculous and impossible.\r\nProfit-sharing could be successful only in isolated cases in the midst\r\nof a system of industrial strife; for if all labor and all capital\r\nshared profits, the same conditions would obtain as did obtain when\r\nthere was no profit-sharing.\r\n\r\nSo, out of the unpractical idea of profit-sharing, arose the practical\r\nidea of grab-sharing. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us more pay and charge it to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas the slogan of the strong unions.[1] And here and there this selfish\r\npolicy worked successfully. In charging it to the public, it was\r\ncharged to the great mass of unorganized labor and of weakly organized\r\nlabor. These workers actually paid the increased wages of their\r\nstronger brothers who were members of unions that were labor\r\nmonopolies. This idea, as I say, was merely carried to its logical\r\nconclusion, on a large scale, by the combination of the oligarchs and\r\nthe favored unions.\r\n\r\n [1] All the railroad unions entered into this combination with the\r\n oligarchs, and it is of interest to note that the first definite\r\n application of the policy of profit-grabbing was made by a railroad\r\n union in the nineteenth century A.D., namely, the Brotherhood of\r\n Locomotive Engineers. P. M. Arthur was for twenty years Grand Chief of\r\n the Brotherhood. After the strike on the Pennsylvania Railroad in\r\n 1877, he broached a scheme to have the Locomotive Engineers make terms\r\n with the railroads and to \xe2\x80\x9cgo it alone\xe2\x80\x9d so far as the rest of the\r\n labor unions were concerned. This scheme was eminently successful. It\r\n was as successful as it was selfish, and out of it was coined the word\r\n \xe2\x80\x9carthurization,\xe2\x80\x9d to denote grab-sharing on the part of labor unions.\r\n This word \xe2\x80\x9carthurization\xe2\x80\x9d has long puzzled the etymologists, but its\r\n derivation, I hope, is now made clear.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the secret of the defection of the favored unions leaked\r\nout, there were rumblings and mutterings in the labor world. Next, the\r\nfavored unions withdrew from the international organizations and broke\r\noff all affiliations. Then came trouble and violence. The members of\r\nthe favored unions were branded as traitors, and in saloons and\r\nbrothels, on the streets and at work, and, in fact, everywhere, they\r\nwere assaulted by the comrades they had so treacherously deserted.\r\n\r\nCountless heads were broken, and there were many killed. No member of\r\nthe favored unions was safe. They gathered together in bands in order\r\nto go to work or to return from work. They walked always in the middle\r\nof the street. On the sidewalk they were liable to have their skulls\r\ncrushed by bricks and cobblestones thrown from windows and house-tops.\r\nThey were permitted to carry weapons, and the authorities aided them in\r\nevery way. Their persecutors were sentenced to long terms in prison,\r\nwhere they were harshly treated; while no man, not a member of the\r\nfavored unions, was permitted to carry weapons. Violation of this law\r\nwas made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly.\r\n\r\nOutraged labor continued to wreak vengeance on the traitors. Caste\r\nlines formed automatically. The children of the traitors were\r\npersecuted by the children of the workers who had been betrayed, until\r\nit was impossible for the former to play on the streets or to attend\r\nthe public schools. Also, the wives and families of the traitors were\r\nostracized, while the corner groceryman who sold provisions to them was\r\nboycotted.\r\n\r\nAs a result, driven back upon themselves from every side, the traitors\r\nand their families became clannish. Finding it impossible to dwell in\r\nsafety in the midst of the betrayed proletariat, they moved into new\r\nlocalities inhabited by themselves alone. In this they were favored by\r\nthe oligarchs. Good dwellings, modern and sanitary, were built for\r\nthem, surrounded by spacious yards, and separated here and there by\r\nparks and playgrounds. Their children attended schools especially built\r\nfor them, and in these schools manual training and applied science were\r\nspecialized upon. Thus, and unavoidably, at the very beginning, out of\r\nthis segregation arose caste. The members of the favored unions became\r\nthe aristocracy of labor. They were set apart from the rest of labor.\r\nThey were better housed, better clothed, better fed, better treated.\r\nThey were grab-sharing with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the rest of the working class was more harshly\r\ntreated. Many little privileges were taken away from it, while its\r\nwages and its standard of living steadily sank down. Incidentally, its\r\npublic schools deteriorated, and education slowly ceased to be\r\ncompulsory. The increase in the younger generation of children who\r\ncould not read nor write was perilous.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the world-market by the United States had disrupted the\r\nrest of the world. Institutions and governments were everywhere\r\ncrashing or transforming. Germany, Italy, France, Australia, and New\r\nZealand were busy forming cooperative commonwealths. The British Empire\r\nwas falling apart. England\xe2\x80\x99s hands were full. In India revolt was in\r\nfull swing. The cry in all Asia was, \xe2\x80\x9cAsia for the Asiatics!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nbehind this cry was Japan, ever urging and aiding the yellow and brown\r\nraces against the white. And while Japan dreamed of continental empire\r\nand strove to realize the dream, she suppressed her own proletarian\r\nrevolution. It was a simple war of the castes, Coolie versus Samurai,\r\nand the coolie socialists were executed by tens of thousands. Forty\r\nthousand were killed in the street-fighting of Tokio and in the futile\r\nassault on the Mikado\xe2\x80\x99s palace. Kobe was a shambles; the slaughter of\r\nthe cotton operatives by machine-guns became classic as the most\r\nterrific execution ever achieved by modern war machines. Most savage of\r\nall was the Japanese Oligarchy that arose. Japan dominated the East,\r\nand took to herself the whole Asiatic portion of the world-market, with\r\nthe exception of India.\r\n\r\nEngland managed to crush her own proletarian revolution and to hold on\r\nto India, though she was brought to the verge of exhaustion. Also, she\r\nwas compelled to let her great colonies slip away from her. So it was\r\nthat the socialists succeeded in making Australia and New Zealand into\r\ncooperative commonwealths. And it was for the same reason that Canada\r\nwas lost to the mother country. But Canada crushed her own socialist\r\nrevolution, being aided in this by the Iron Heel. At the same time, the\r\nIron Heel helped Mexico and Cuba to put down revolt. The result was\r\nthat the Iron Heel was firmly established in the New World. It had\r\nwelded into one compact political mass the whole of North America from\r\nthe Panama Canal to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nAnd England, at the sacrifice of her great colonies, had succeeded only\r\nin retaining India. But this was no more than temporary. The struggle\r\nwith Japan and the rest of Asia for India was merely delayed. England\r\nwas destined shortly to lose India, while behind that event loomed the\r\nstruggle between a united Asia and the world.\r\n\r\nAnd while all the world was torn with conflict, we of the United States\r\nwere not placid and peaceful. The defection of the great unions had\r\nprevented our proletarian revolt, but violence was everywhere. In\r\naddition to the labor troubles, and the discontent of the farmers and\r\nof the remnant of the middle class, a religious revival had blazed up.\r\nAn offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventists sprang into sudden\r\nprominence, proclaiming the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfusion thrice confounded!\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we hope for\r\nsolidarity with all these cross purposes and conflicts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd truly the religious revival assumed formidable proportions. The\r\npeople, what of their wretchedness, and of their disappointment in all\r\nthings earthly, were ripe and eager for a heaven where industrial\r\ntyrants entered no more than camels passed through needle-eyes.\r\nWild-eyed itinerant preachers swarmed over the land; and despite the\r\nprohibition of the civil authorities, and the persecution for\r\ndisobedience, the flames of religious frenzy were fanned by countless\r\ncamp-meetings.\r\n\r\nIt was the last days, they claimed, the beginning of the end of the\r\nworld. The four winds had been loosed. God had stirred the nations to\r\nstrife. It was a time of visions and miracles, while seers and\r\nprophetesses were legion. The people ceased work by hundreds of\r\nthousands and fled to the mountains, there to await the imminent coming\r\nof God and the rising of the hundred and forty and four thousand to\r\nheaven. But in the meantime God did not come, and they starved to death\r\nin great numbers. In their desperation they ravaged the farms for food,\r\nand the consequent tumult and anarchy in the country districts but\r\nincreased the woes of the poor expropriated farmers.\r\n\r\nAlso, the farms and warehouses were the property of the Iron Heel.\r\nArmies of troops were put into the field, and the fanatics were herded\r\nback at the bayonet point to their tasks in the cities. There they\r\nbroke out in ever recurring mobs and riots. Their leaders were executed\r\nfor sedition or confined in madhouses. Those who were executed went to\r\ntheir deaths with all the gladness of martyrs. It was a time of\r\nmadness. The unrest spread. In the swamps and deserts and waste places,\r\nfrom Florida to Alaska, the small groups of Indians that survived were\r\ndancing ghost dances and waiting the coming of a Messiah of their own.\r\n\r\nAnd through it all, with a serenity and certitude that was terrifying,\r\ncontinued to rise the form of that monster of the ages, the Oligarchy.\r\nWith iron hand and iron heel it mastered the surging millions, out of\r\nconfusion brought order, out of the very chaos wrought its own\r\nfoundation and structure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust wait till we get in,\xe2\x80\x9d the Grangers said\xe2\x80\x94Calvin said it to us in\r\nour Pell Street quarters. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the states we\xe2\x80\x99ve captured. With you\r\nsocialists to back us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make them sing another song when we take\r\noffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe millions of the discontented and the impoverished are ours,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nsocialists said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Grangers have come over to us, the farmers, the\r\nmiddle class, and the laborers. The capitalist system will fall to\r\npieces. In another month we send fifty men to Congress. Two years hence\r\nevery office will be ours, from the President down to the local\r\ndog-catcher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all of which Ernest would shake his head and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many rifles have you got? Do you know where you can get plenty of\r\nlead? When it comes to powder, chemical mixtures are better than\r\nmechanical mixtures, you take my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it came time for Ernest and me to go to Washington, father did not\r\naccompany us. He had become enamoured of proletarian life. He looked\r\nupon our slum neighborhood as a great sociological laboratory, and he\r\nhad embarked upon an apparently endless orgy of investigation. He\r\nchummed with the laborers, and was an intimate in scores of homes.\r\nAlso, he worked at odd jobs, and the work was play as well as learned\r\ninvestigation, for he delighted in it and was always returning home\r\nwith copious notes and bubbling over with new adventures. He was the\r\nperfect scientist.\r\n\r\nThere was no need for his working at all, because Ernest managed to\r\nearn enough from his translating to take care of the three of us. But\r\nfather insisted on pursuing his favorite phantom, and a protean phantom\r\nit was, judging from the jobs he worked at. I shall never forget the\r\nevening he brought home his street pedler\xe2\x80\x99s outfit of shoe-laces and\r\nsuspenders, nor the time I went into the little corner grocery to make\r\nsome purchase and had him wait on me. After that I was not surprised\r\nwhen he tended bar for a week in the saloon across the street. He\r\nworked as a night watchman, hawked potatoes on the street, pasted\r\nlabels in a cannery warehouse, was utility man in a paper-box factory,\r\nand water-carrier for a street railway construction gang, and even\r\njoined the Dishwashers\xe2\x80\x99 Union just before it fell to pieces.\r\n\r\nI think the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s example, so far as wearing apparel was concerned,\r\nmust have fascinated father, for he wore the cheap cotton shirt of the\r\nlaborer and the overalls with the narrow strap about the hips. Yet one\r\nhabit remained to him from the old life; he always dressed for dinner,\r\nor supper, rather.\r\n\r\nI could be happy anywhere with Ernest; and father\xe2\x80\x99s happiness in our\r\nchanged circumstances rounded out my own happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d father said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was very curious. I wanted to know\r\nwhy things were and how they came to pass. That was why I became a\r\nphysicist. The life in me to-day is just as curious as it was in my\r\nboyhood, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the being curious that makes life worth living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes he ventured north of Market Street into the shopping and\r\ntheatre district, where he sold papers, ran errands, and opened cabs.\r\nThere, one day, closing a cab, he encountered Mr. Wickson. In high glee\r\nfather described the incident to us that evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWickson looked at me sharply when I closed the door on him, and\r\nmuttered, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned.\xe2\x80\x99 Just like that he said it, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned.\xe2\x80\x99 His face turned red and he was so confused that he\r\nforgot to tip me. But he must have recovered himself quickly, for the\r\ncab hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone fifty feet before it turned around and came back. He\r\nleaned out of the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Look here, Professor,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98this is too much. What can I do for\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I closed the cab door for you,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered. \xe2\x80\x98According to common\r\ncustom you might give me a dime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bother that!\xe2\x80\x99 he snorted. \xe2\x80\x98I mean something substantial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was certainly serious\xe2\x80\x94a twinge of ossified conscience or something;\r\nand so I considered with grave deliberation for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis face was quite expectant when I began my answer, but you should\r\nhave seen it when I finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You might give me back my home,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98and my stock in the Sierra\r\nMills.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d I questioned eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could he say? He said nothing. But I said, \xe2\x80\x98I hope you are\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked at me curiously. \xe2\x80\x98Tell me, are you happy?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ordered the cabman to drive on, and went away swearing horribly.\r\nAnd he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me the dime, much less the home and stock; so you\r\nsee, my dear, your father\xe2\x80\x99s street-arab career is beset with\r\ndisappointments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that father kept on at our Pell Street quarters, while\r\nErnest and I went to Washington. Except for the final consummation, the\r\nold order had passed away, and the final consummation was nearer than I\r\ndreamed. Contrary to our expectation, no obstacles were raised to\r\nprevent the socialist Congressmen from taking their seats. Everything\r\nwent smoothly, and I laughed at Ernest when he looked upon the very\r\nsmoothness as something ominous.\r\n\r\nWe found our socialist comrades confident, optimistic of their strength\r\nand of the things they would accomplish. A few Grangers who had been\r\nelected to Congress increased our strength, and an elaborate programme\r\nof what was to be done was prepared by the united forces. In all of\r\nwhich Ernest joined loyally and energetically, though he could not\r\nforbear, now and again, from saying, apropos of nothing in particular,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to powder, chemical mixtures are better than mechanical\r\nmixtures, you take my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trouble arose first with the Grangers in the various states they\r\nhad captured at the last election. There were a dozen of these states,\r\nbut the Grangers who had been elected were not permitted to take\r\noffice. The incumbents refused to get out. It was very simple. They\r\nmerely charged illegality in the elections and wrapped up the whole\r\nsituation in the interminable red tape of the law. The Grangers were\r\npowerless. The courts were in the hands of their enemies.\r\n\r\nThis was the moment of danger. If the cheated Grangers became violent,\r\nall was lost. How we socialists worked to hold them back! There were\r\ndays and nights when Ernest never closed his eyes in sleep. The big\r\nleaders of the Grangers saw the peril and were with us to a man. But it\r\nwas all of no avail. The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its\r\nagents-provocateurs to work. Without discussion, it was the\r\nagents-provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt.\r\n\r\nIn a dozen states the revolt flared up. The expropriated farmers took\r\nforcible possession of the state governments. Of course this was\r\nunconstitutional, and of course the United States put its soldiers into\r\nthe field. Everywhere the agents-provocateurs urged the people on.\r\nThese emissaries of the Iron Heel disguised themselves as artisans,\r\nfarmers, and farm laborers. In Sacramento, the capital of California,\r\nthe Grangers had succeeded in maintaining order. Thousands of secret\r\nagents were rushed to the devoted city. In mobs composed wholly of\r\nthemselves, they fired and looted buildings and factories. They worked\r\nthe people up until they joined them in the pillage. Liquor in large\r\nquantities was distributed among the slum classes further to inflame\r\ntheir minds. And then, when all was ready, appeared upon the scene the\r\nsoldiers of the United States, who were, in reality, the soldiers of\r\nthe Iron Heel. Eleven thousand men, women, and children were shot down\r\non the streets of Sacramento or murdered in their houses. The national\r\ngovernment took possession of the state government, and all was over\r\nfor California.\r\n\r\nAnd as with California, so elsewhere. Every Granger state was ravaged\r\nwith violence and washed in blood. First, disorder was precipitated by\r\nthe secret agents and the Black Hundreds, then the troops were called\r\nout. Rioting and mob-rule reigned throughout the rural districts. Day\r\nand night the smoke of burning farms, warehouses, villages, and cities\r\nfilled the sky. Dynamite appeared. Railroad bridges and tunnels were\r\nblown up and trains were wrecked. The poor farmers were shot and hanged\r\nin great numbers. Reprisals were bitter, and many plutocrats and army\r\nofficers were murdered. Blood and vengeance were in men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts. The\r\nregular troops fought the farmers as savagely as had they been Indians.\r\nAnd the regular troops had cause. Twenty-eight hundred of them had been\r\nannihilated in a tremendous series of dynamite explosions in Oregon,\r\nand in a similar manner, a number of train loads, at different times\r\nand places, had been destroyed. So it was that the regular troops\r\nfought for their lives as well as did the farmers.\r\n\r\nAs for the militia, the militia law of 1903 was put into effect, and\r\nthe workers of one state were compelled, under pain of death, to shoot\r\ndown their comrade-workers in other states. Of course, the militia law\r\ndid not work smoothly at first. Many militia officers were murdered,\r\nand many militiamen were executed by drumhead court martial. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprophecy was strikingly fulfilled in the cases of Mr. Kowalt and Mr.\r\nAsmunsen. Both were eligible for the militia, and both were drafted to\r\nserve in the punitive expedition that was despatched from California\r\nagainst the farmers of Missouri. Mr. Kowalt and Mr. Asmunsen refused to\r\nserve. They were given short shrift. Drumhead court martial was their\r\nportion, and military execution their end. They were shot with their\r\nbacks to the firing squad.\r\n\r\nMany young men fled into the mountains to escape serving in the\r\nmilitia. There they became outlaws, and it was not until more peaceful\r\ntimes that they received their punishment. It was drastic. The\r\ngovernment issued a proclamation for all law-abiding citizens to come\r\nin from the mountains for a period of three months. When the proclaimed\r\ndate arrived, half a million soldiers were sent into the mountainous\r\ndistricts everywhere. There was no investigation, no trial. Wherever a\r\nman was encountered, he was shot down on the spot. The troops operated\r\non the basis that no man not an outlaw remained in the mountains. Some\r\nbands, in strong positions, fought gallantly, but in the end every\r\ndeserter from the militia met death.\r\n\r\nA more immediate lesson, however, was impressed on the minds of the\r\npeople by the punishment meted out to the Kansas militia. The great\r\nKansas Mutiny occurred at the very beginning of military operations\r\nagainst the Grangers. Six thousand of the militia mutinied. They had\r\nbeen for several weeks very turbulent and sullen, and for that reason\r\nhad been kept in camp. Their open mutiny, however, was without doubt\r\nprecipitated by the agents-provocateurs.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 22d of April they arose and murdered their\r\nofficers, only a small remnant of the latter escaping. This was beyond\r\nthe scheme of the Iron Heel, for the agents-provocateurs had done their\r\nwork too well. But everything was grist to the Iron Heel. It had\r\nprepared for the outbreak, and the killing of so many officers gave it\r\njustification for what followed. As by magic, forty thousand soldiers\r\nof the regular army surrounded the malcontents. It was a trap. The\r\nwretched militiamen found that their machine-guns had been tampered\r\nwith, and that the cartridges from the captured magazines did not fit\r\ntheir rifles. They hoisted the white flag of surrender, but it was\r\nignored. There were no survivors. The entire six thousand were\r\nannihilated. Common shell and shrapnel were thrown in upon them from a\r\ndistance, and, when, in their desperation, they charged the encircling\r\nlines, they were mowed down by the machine-guns. I talked with an\r\neye-witness, and he said that the nearest any militiaman approached the\r\nmachine-guns was a hundred and fifty yards. The earth was carpeted with\r\nthe slain, and a final charge of cavalry, with trampling of horses\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhoofs, revolvers, and sabres, crushed the wounded into the ground.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the destruction of the Grangers came the revolt of\r\nthe coal miners. It was the expiring effort of organized labor.\r\nThree-quarters of a million of miners went out on strike. But they were\r\ntoo widely scattered over the country to advantage from their own\r\nstrength. They were segregated in their own districts and beaten into\r\nsubmission. This was the first great slave-drive. Pocock[1] won his\r\nspurs as a slave-driver and earned the undying hatred of the\r\nproletariat. Countless attempts were made upon his life, but he seemed\r\nto bear a charmed existence. It was he who was responsible for the\r\nintroduction of the Russian passport system among the miners, and the\r\ndenial of their right of removal from one part of the country to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n [1] Albert Pocock, another of the notorious strike-breakers of earlier\r\n years, who, to the day of his death, successfully held all the\r\n coal-miners of the country to their task. He was succeeded by his son,\r\n Lewis Pocock, and for five generations this remarkable line of\r\n slave-drivers handled the coal mines. The elder Pocock, known as\r\n Pocock I., has been described as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cA long, lean head,\r\n semicircled by a fringe of brown and gray hair, with big cheek-bones\r\n and a heavy chin, . . . a pale face, lustreless gray eyes, a metallic\r\n voice, and a languid manner.\xe2\x80\x9d He was born of humble parents, and began\r\n his career as a bartender. He next became a private detective for a\r\n street railway corporation, and by successive steps developed into a\r\n professional strikebreaker. Pocock V., the last of the line, was blown\r\n up in a pump-house by a bomb during a petty revolt of the miners in\r\n the Indian Territory. This occurred in 2073 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the socialists held firm. While the Grangers expired\r\nin flame and blood, and organized labor was disrupted, the socialists\r\nheld their peace and perfected their secret organization. In vain the\r\nGrangers pleaded with us. We rightly contended that any revolt on our\r\npart was virtually suicide for the whole Revolution. The Iron Heel, at\r\nfirst dubious about dealing with the entire proletariat at one time,\r\nhad found the work easier than it had expected, and would have asked\r\nnothing better than an uprising on our part. But we avoided the issue,\r\nin spite of the fact that agents-provocateurs swarmed in our midst. In\r\nthose early days, the agents of the Iron Heel were clumsy in their\r\nmethods. They had much to learn and in the meantime our Fighting Groups\r\nweeded them out. It was bitter, bloody work, but we were fighting for\r\nlife and for the Revolution, and we had to fight the enemy with its own\r\nweapons. Yet we were fair. No agent of the Iron Heel was executed\r\nwithout a trial. We may have made mistakes, but if so, very rarely. The\r\nbravest, and the most combative and self-sacrificing of our comrades\r\nwent into the Fighting Groups. Once, after ten years had passed, Ernest\r\nmade a calculation from figures furnished by the chiefs of the Fighting\r\nGroups, and his conclusion was that the average life of a man or woman\r\nafter becoming a member was five years. The comrades of the Fighting\r\nGroups were heroes all, and the peculiar thing about it was that they\r\nwere opposed to the taking of life. They violated their own natures,\r\nyet they loved liberty and knew of no sacrifice too great to make for\r\nthe Cause.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] These Fighting groups were modelled somewhat after the Fighting\r\n Organization of the Russian Revolution, and, despite the unceasing\r\n efforts of the Iron Heel, these groups persisted throughout the three\r\n centuries of its existence. Composed of men and women actuated by\r\n lofty purpose and unafraid to die, the Fighting Groups exercised\r\n tremendous influence and tempered the savage brutality of the rulers.\r\n Not alone was their work confined to unseen warfare with the secret\r\n agents of the Oligarchy. The oligarchs themselves were compelled to\r\n listen to the decrees of the Groups, and often, when they disobeyed,\r\n were punished by death\xe2\x80\x94and likewise with the subordinates of the\r\n oligarchs, with the officers of the army and the leaders of the labor\r\n castes.\r\n    Stern justice was meted out by these organized avengers, but most\r\n    remarkable was their passionless and judicial procedure. There were\r\n    no snap judgments. When a man was captured he was given fair trial\r\n    and opportunity for defence. Of necessity, many men were tried and\r\n    condemned by proxy, as in the case of General Lampton. This\r\n    occurred in 2138 A.D. Possibly the most bloodthirsty and malignant\r\n    of all the mercenaries that ever served the Iron Heel, he was\r\n    informed by the Fighting Groups that they had tried him, found him\r\n    guilty, and condemned him to death\xe2\x80\x94and this, after three warnings\r\n    for him to cease from his ferocious treatment of the proletariat.\r\n    After his condemnation he surrounded himself with a myriad\r\n    protective devices. Years passed, and in vain the Fighting Groups\r\n    strove to execute their decree. Comrade after comrade, men and\r\n    women, failed in their attempts, and were cruelly executed by the\r\n    Oligarchy. It was the case of General Lampton that revived\r\n    crucifixion as a legal method of execution. But in the end the\r\n    condemned man found his executioner in the form of a slender girl\r\n    of seventeen, Madeline Provence, who, to accomplish her purpose,\r\n    served two years in his palace as a seamstress to the household.\r\n    She died in solitary confinement after horrible and prolonged\r\n    torture; but to-day she stands in imperishable bronze in the\r\n    Pantheon of Brotherhood in the wonder city of Serles.\r\n    We, who by personal experience know nothing of bloodshed, must not\r\n    judge harshly the heroes of the Fighting Groups. They gave up their\r\n    lives for humanity, no sacrifice was too great for them to\r\n    accomplish, while inexorable necessity compelled them to bloody\r\n    expression in an age of blood. The Fighting Groups constituted the\r\n    one thorn in the side of the Iron Heel that the Iron Heel could\r\n    never remove. Everhard was the father of this curious army, and its\r\n    accomplishments and successful persistence for three hundred years\r\n    bear witness to the wisdom with which he organized and the solid\r\n    foundation he laid for the succeeding generations to build upon. In\r\n    some respects, despite his great economic and sociological\r\n    contributions, and his work as a general leader in the Revolution,\r\n    his organization of the Fighting Groups must be regarded as his\r\n    greatest achievement.\r\n\r\nThe task we set ourselves was threefold. First, the weeding out from\r\nour circles of the secret agents of the Oligarchy. Second, the\r\norganizing of the Fighting Groups, and outside of them, of the general\r\nsecret organization of the Revolution. And third, the introduction of\r\nour own secret agents into every branch of the Oligarchy\xe2\x80\x94into the labor\r\ncastes and especially among the telegraphers and secretaries and\r\nclerks, into the army, the agents-provocateurs, and the slave-drivers.\r\nIt was slow work, and perilous, and often were our efforts rewarded\r\nwith costly failures.\r\n\r\nThe Iron Heel had triumphed in open warfare, but we held our own in the\r\nnew warfare, strange and awful and subterranean, that we instituted.\r\nAll was unseen, much was unguessed; the blind fought the blind; and yet\r\nthrough it all was order, purpose, control. We permeated the entire\r\norganization of the Iron Heel with our agents, while our own\r\norganization was permeated with the agents of the Iron Heel. It was\r\nwarfare dark and devious, replete with intrigue and conspiracy, plot\r\nand counterplot. And behind all, ever menacing, was death, violent and\r\nterrible. Men and women disappeared, our nearest and dearest comrades.\r\nWe saw them to-day. To-morrow they were gone; we never saw them again,\r\nand we knew that they had died.\r\n\r\nThere was no trust, no confidence anywhere. The man who plotted beside\r\nus, for all we knew, might be an agent of the Iron Heel. We mined the\r\norganization of the Iron Heel with our secret agents, and the Iron Heel\r\ncountermined with its secret agents inside its own organization. And it\r\nwas the same with our organization. And despite the absence of\r\nconfidence and trust we were compelled to base our every effort on\r\nconfidence and trust. Often were we betrayed. Men were weak. The Iron\r\nHeel could offer money, leisure, the joys and pleasures that waited in\r\nthe repose of the wonder cities. We could offer nothing but the\r\nsatisfaction of being faithful to a noble ideal. As for the rest, the\r\nwages of those who were loyal were unceasing peril, torture, and death.\r\n\r\nMen were weak, I say, and because of their weakness we were compelled\r\nto make the only other reward that was within our power. It was the\r\nreward of death. Out of necessity we had to punish our traitors. For\r\nevery man who betrayed us, from one to a dozen faithful avengers were\r\nloosed upon his heels. We might fail to carry out our decrees against\r\nour enemies, such as the Pococks, for instance; but the one thing we\r\ncould not afford to fail in was the punishment of our own traitors.\r\nComrades turned traitor by permission, in order to win to the wonder\r\ncities and there execute our sentences on the real traitors. In fact,\r\nso terrible did we make ourselves, that it became a greater peril to\r\nbetray us than to remain loyal to us.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution took on largely the character of religion. We worshipped\r\nat the shrine of the Revolution, which was the shrine of liberty. It\r\nwas the divine flashing through us. Men and women devoted their lives\r\nto the Cause, and new-born babes were sealed to it as of old they had\r\nbeen sealed to the service of God. We were lovers of Humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nTHE SCARLET LIVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the destruction of the Granger states, the Grangers in Congress\r\ndisappeared. They were being tried for high treason, and their places\r\nwere taken by the creatures of the Iron Heel. The socialists were in a\r\npitiful minority, and they knew that their end was near. Congress and\r\nthe Senate were empty pretences, farces. Public questions were gravely\r\ndebated and passed upon according to the old forms, while in reality\r\nall that was done was to give the stamp of constitutional procedure to\r\nthe mandates of the Oligarchy.\r\n\r\nErnest was in the thick of the fight when the end came. It was in the\r\ndebate on the bill to assist the unemployed. The hard times of the\r\npreceding year had thrust great masses of the proletariat beneath the\r\nstarvation line, and the continued and wide-reaching disorder had but\r\nsunk them deeper. Millions of people were starving, while the oligarchs\r\nand their supporters were surfeiting on the surplus.[1] We called these\r\nwretched people the people of the abyss,[2] and it was to alleviate\r\ntheir awful suffering that the socialists had introduced the unemployed\r\nbill. But this was not to the fancy of the Iron Heel. In its own way it\r\nwas preparing to set these millions to work, but the way was not our\r\nway, wherefore it had issued its orders that our bill should be voted\r\ndown. Ernest and his fellows knew that their effort was futile, but\r\nthey were tired of the suspense. They wanted something to happen. They\r\nwere accomplishing nothing, and the best they hoped for was the putting\r\nof an end to the legislative farce in which they were unwilling\r\nplayers. They knew not what end would come, but they never anticipated\r\na more disastrous end than the one that did come.\r\n\r\n [1] The same conditions obtained in the nineteenth century A.D. under\r\n British rule in India. The natives died of starvation by the million,\r\n while their rulers robbed them of the fruits of their toil and\r\n expended it on magnificent pageants and mumbo-jumbo fooleries.\r\n Perforce, in this enlightened age, we have much to blush for in the\r\n acts of our ancestors. Our only consolation is philosophic. We must\r\n accept the capitalistic stage in social evolution as about on a par\r\n with the earlier monkey stage. The human had to pass through those\r\n stages in its rise from the mire and slime of low organic life. It was\r\n inevitable that much of the mire and slime should cling and be not\r\n easily shaken off.\r\n\r\n [2] _The people of the abyss_\xe2\x80\x94this phrase was struck out by the genius\r\n of H. G. Wells in the late nineteenth century A.D. Wells was a\r\n sociological seer, sane and normal as well as warm human. Many\r\n fragments of his work have come down to us, while two of his greatest\r\n achievements, \xe2\x80\x9cAnticipations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMankind in the Making,\xe2\x80\x9d have come\r\n down intact. Before the oligarchs, and before Everhard, Wells\r\n speculated upon the building of the wonder cities, though in his\r\n writings they are referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cpleasure cities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sat in the gallery that day. We all knew that something terrible was\r\nimminent. It was in the air, and its presence was made visible by the\r\narmed soldiers drawn up in lines in the corridors, and by the officers\r\ngrouped in the entrances to the House itself. The Oligarchy was about\r\nto strike. Ernest was speaking. He was describing the sufferings of the\r\nunemployed, as if with the wild idea of in some way touching their\r\nhearts and consciences; but the Republican and Democratic members\r\nsneered and jeered at him, and there was uproar and confusion. Ernest\r\nabruptly changed front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing that I may say can influence you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nno souls to be influenced. You are spineless, flaccid things. You\r\npompously call yourselves Republicans and Democrats. There is no\r\nRepublican Party. There is no Democratic Party. There are no\r\nRepublicans nor Democrats in this House. You are lick-spittlers and\r\npanderers, the creatures of the Plutocracy. You talk verbosely in\r\nantiquated terminology of your love of liberty, and all the while you\r\nwear the scarlet livery of the Iron Heel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the shouting and the cries of \xe2\x80\x9cOrder! order!\xe2\x80\x9d drowned his voice,\r\nand he stood disdainfully till the din had somewhat subsided. He waved\r\nhis hand to include all of them, turned to his own comrades, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to the bellowing of the well-fed beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPandemonium broke out again. The Speaker rapped for order and glanced\r\nexpectantly at the officers in the doorways. There were cries of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSedition!\xe2\x80\x9d and a great, rotund New York member began shouting\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnarchist!\xe2\x80\x9d at Ernest. And Ernest was not pleasant to look at. Every\r\nfighting fibre of him was quivering, and his face was the face of a\r\nfighting animal, withal he was cool and collected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a voice that made itself heard above the din,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat as you show mercy now to the proletariat, some day will that same\r\nproletariat show mercy to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cries of \xe2\x80\x9cSedition!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAnarchist!\xe2\x80\x9d redoubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that you will not vote for this bill,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave received the command from your masters to vote against it. And yet\r\nyou call me anarchist. You, who have destroyed the government of the\r\npeople, and who shamelessly flaunt your scarlet shame in public places,\r\ncall me anarchist. I do not believe in hell-fire and brimstone; but in\r\nmoments like this I regret my unbelief. Nay, in moments like this I\r\nalmost do believe. Surely there must be a hell, for in no less place\r\ncould it be possible for you to receive punishment adequate to your\r\ncrimes. So long as you exist, there is a vital need for hell-fire in\r\nthe Cosmos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was movement in the doorways. Ernest, the Speaker, all the\r\nmembers turned to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not call your soldiers in, Mr. Speaker, and bid them do\r\ntheir work?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cThey should carry out your plan with\r\nexpedition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are other plans afoot,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is why the\r\nsoldiers are present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur plans, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cAssassination or something\r\nkindred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at the word \xe2\x80\x9cassassination\xe2\x80\x9d the uproar broke out again. Ernest\r\ncould not make himself heard, but he remained on his feet waiting for a\r\nlull. And then it happened. From my place in the gallery I saw nothing\r\nexcept the flash of the explosion. The roar of it filled my ears and I\r\nsaw Ernest reeling and falling in a swirl of smoke, and the soldiers\r\nrushing up all the aisles. His comrades were on their feet, wild with\r\nanger, capable of any violence. But Ernest steadied himself for a\r\nmoment, and waved his arms for silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a plot!\xe2\x80\x9d his voice rang out in warning to his comrades. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nnothing, or you will be destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he slowly sank down, and the soldiers reached him. The next moment\r\nsoldiers were clearing the galleries and I saw no more.\r\n\r\nThough he was my husband, I was not permitted to get to him. When I\r\nannounced who I was, I was promptly placed under arrest. And at the\r\nsame time were arrested all socialist Congressmen in Washington,\r\nincluding the unfortunate Simpson, who lay ill with typhoid fever in\r\nhis hotel.\r\n\r\nThe trial was prompt and brief. The men were foredoomed. The wonder was\r\nthat Ernest was not executed. This was a blunder on the part of the\r\nOligarchy, and a costly one. But the Oligarchy was too confident in\r\nthose days. It was drunk with success, and little did it dream that\r\nthat small handful of heroes had within them the power to rock it to\r\nits foundations. To-morrow, when the Great Revolt breaks out and all\r\nthe world resounds with the tramp, tramp of the millions, the Oligarchy\r\nwill realize, and too late, how mightily that band of heroes has\r\ngrown.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] Avis Everhard took for granted that her narrative would be read in\r\n her own day, and so omits to mention the outcome of the trial for high\r\n treason. Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in\r\n the Manuscript. Fifty-two socialist Congressmen were tried, and all\r\n were found guilty. Strange to relate, not one received the death\r\n sentence. Everhard and eleven others, among whom were Theodore\r\n Donnelson and Matthew Kent, received life imprisonment. The remaining\r\n forty received sentences varying from thirty to forty-five years;\r\n while Arthur Simpson, referred to in the Manuscript as being ill of\r\n typhoid fever at the time of the explosion, received only fifteen\r\n years. It is the tradition that he died of starvation in solitary\r\n confinement, and this harsh treatment is explained as having been\r\n caused by his uncompromising stubbornness and his fiery and tactless\r\n hatred for all men that served the despotism. He died in Caba\xc3\xb1as in\r\n Cuba, where three of his comrades were also confined. The fifty- two\r\n socialist Congressmen were confined in military fortresses scattered\r\n all over the United States. Thus, Du Bois and Woods were held in Porto\r\n Rico, while Everhard and Merryweather were placed in Alcatraz, an\r\n island in San Francisco Bay that had already seen long service as a\r\n military prison.\r\n\r\nAs a revolutionist myself, as one on the inside who knew the hopes and\r\nfears and secret plans of the revolutionists, I am fitted to answer, as\r\nvery few are, the charge that they were guilty of exploding the bomb in\r\nCongress. And I can say flatly, without qualification or doubt of any\r\nsort, that the socialists, in Congress and out, had no hand in the\r\naffair. Who threw the bomb we do not know, but the one thing we are\r\nabsolutely sure of is that we did not throw it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is evidence to show that the Iron Heel was\r\nresponsible for the act. Of course, we cannot prove this. Our\r\nconclusion is merely presumptive. But here are such facts as we do\r\nknow. It had been reported to the Speaker of the House, by\r\nsecret-service agents of the government, that the Socialist Congressmen\r\nwere about to resort to terroristic tactics, and that they had decided\r\nupon the day when their tactics would go into effect. This day was the\r\nvery day of the explosion. Wherefore the Capitol had been packed with\r\ntroops in anticipation. Since we knew nothing about the bomb, and since\r\na bomb actually was exploded, and since the authorities had prepared in\r\nadvance for the explosion, it is only fair to conclude that the Iron\r\nHeel did know. Furthermore, we charge that the Iron Heel was guilty of\r\nthe outrage, and that the Iron Heel planned and perpetrated the outrage\r\nfor the purpose of foisting the guilt on our shoulders and so bringing\r\nabout our destruction.\r\n\r\nFrom the Speaker the warning leaked out to all the creatures in the\r\nHouse that wore the scarlet livery. They knew, while Ernest was\r\nspeaking, that some violent act was to be committed. And to do them\r\njustice, they honestly believed that the act was to be committed by the\r\nsocialists. At the trial, and still with honest belief, several\r\ntestified to having seen Ernest prepare to throw the bomb, and that it\r\nexploded prematurely. Of course they saw nothing of the sort. In the\r\nfevered imagination of fear they thought they saw, that was all.\r\n\r\nAs Ernest said at the trial: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it stand to reason, if I were going\r\nto throw a bomb, that I should elect to throw a feeble little squib\r\nlike the one that was thrown? There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough powder in it. It made\r\na lot of smoke, but hurt no one except me. It exploded right at my\r\nfeet, and yet it did not kill me. Believe me, when I get to throwing\r\nbombs, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do damage. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be more than smoke in my petards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn return it was argued by the prosecution that the weakness of the\r\nbomb was a blunder on the part of the socialists, just as its premature\r\nexplosion, caused by Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s losing his nerve and dropping it, was a\r\nblunder. And to clinch the argument, there were the several Congressmen\r\nwho testified to having seen Ernest fumble and drop the bomb.\r\n\r\nAs for ourselves, not one of us knew how the bomb was thrown. Ernest\r\ntold me that the fraction of an instant before it exploded he both\r\nheard and saw it strike at his feet. He testified to this at the trial,\r\nbut no one believed him. Besides, the whole thing, in popular slang,\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9ccooked up.\xe2\x80\x9d The Iron Heel had made up its mind to destroy us, and\r\nthere was no withstanding it.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying that truth will out. I have come to doubt that\r\nsaying. Nineteen years have elapsed, and despite our untiring efforts,\r\nwe have failed to find the man who really did throw the bomb.\r\nUndoubtedly he was some emissary of the Iron Heel, but he has escaped\r\ndetection. We have never got the slightest clew to his identity. And\r\nnow, at this late date, nothing remains but for the affair to take its\r\nplace among the mysteries of history.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] Avis Everhard would have had to live for many generations ere she\r\n could have seen the clearing up of this particular mystery. A little\r\n less than a hundred years ago, and a little more than six hundred\r\n years after her death, the confession of Pervaise was discovered in\r\n the secret archives of the Vatican. It is perhaps well to tell a\r\n little something about this obscure document, which, in the main, is\r\n of interest to the historian only.\r\n    Pervaise was an American, of French descent, who in 1913 A.D., was\r\n    lying in the Tombs Prison, New York City, awaiting trial for\r\n    murder. From his confession we learn that he was not a criminal. He\r\n    was warm-blooded, passionate, emotional. In an insane fit of\r\n    jealousy he killed his wife\xe2\x80\x94a very common act in those times.\r\n    Pervaise was mastered by the fear of death, all of which is\r\n    recounted at length in his confession. To escape death he would\r\n    have done anything, and the police agents prepared him by assuring\r\n    him that he could not possibly escape conviction of murder in the\r\n    first degree when his trial came off. In those days, murder in the\r\n    first degree was a capital offense. The guilty man or woman was\r\n    placed in a specially constructed death-chair, and, under the\r\n    supervision of competent physicians, was destroyed by a current of\r\n    electricity. This was called electrocution, and it was very popular\r\n    during that period. Anaesthesia, as a mode of compulsory death, was\r\n    not introduced until later.\r\n    This man, good at heart but with a ferocious animalism close at the\r\n    surface of his being, lying in jail and expectant of nothing less\r\n    than death, was prevailed upon by the agents of the Iron Heel to\r\n    throw the bomb in the House of Representatives. In his confession\r\n    he states explicitly that he was informed that the bomb was to be a\r\n    feeble thing and that no lives would be lost. This is directly in\r\n    line with the fact that the bomb was lightly charged, and that its\r\n    explosion at Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s feet was not deadly.\r\n    Pervaise was smuggled into one of the galleries ostensibly closed\r\n    for repairs. He was to select the moment for the throwing of the\r\n    bomb, and he naively confesses that in his interest in Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    tirade and the general commotion raised thereby, he nearly forgot\r\n    his mission.\r\n    Not only was he released from prison in reward for his deed, but he\r\n    was granted an income for life. This he did not long enjoy. In 1914\r\n    A.D., in September, he was stricken with rheumatism of the heart\r\n    and lived for three days. It was then that he sent for the Catholic\r\n    priest, Father Peter Durban, and to him made confession. So\r\n    important did it seem to the priest, that he had the confession\r\n    taken down in writing and sworn to. What happened after this we can\r\n    only surmise. The document was certainly important enough to find\r\n    its way to Rome. Powerful influences must have been brought to\r\n    bear, hence its suppression. For centuries no hint of its existence\r\n    reached the world. It was not until in the last century that\r\n    Lorbia, the brilliant Italian scholar, stumbled upon it quite by\r\n    chance during his researches in the Vatican.\r\n    There is to-day no doubt whatever that the Iron Heel was\r\n    responsible for the bomb that exploded in the House of\r\n    Representatives in 1913 A.D. Even though the Pervaise confession\r\n    had never come to light, no reasonable doubt could obtain; for the\r\n    act in question, that sent fifty-two Congressmen to prison, was on\r\n    a par with countless other acts committed by the oligarchs, and,\r\n    before them, by the capitalists.\r\n    There is the classic instance of the ferocious and wanton judicial\r\n    murder of the innocent and so-called Haymarket Anarchists in\r\n    Chicago in the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century A.D. In\r\n    a category by itself is the deliberate burning and destruction of\r\n    capitalist property by the capitalists themselves. For such\r\n    destruction of property innocent men were frequently\r\n    punished\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crailroaded\xe2\x80\x9d in the parlance of the times.\r\n    In the labor troubles of the first decade of the twentieth century\r\n    A.D., between the capitalists and the Western Federation of Miners,\r\n    similar but more bloody tactics were employed. The railroad station\r\n    at Independence was blown up by the agents of the capitalists.\r\n    Thirteen men were killed, and many more were wounded. And then the\r\n    capitalists, controlling the legislative and judicial machinery of\r\n    the state of Colorado, charged the miners with the crime and came\r\n    very near to convicting them. Romaines, one of the tools in this\r\n    affair, like Pervaise, was lying in jail in another state, Kansas,\r\n    awaiting trial, when he was approached by the agents of the\r\n    capitalists. But, unlike Pervaise, the confession of Romaines was\r\n    made public in his own time.\r\n    Then, during this same period, there was the case of Moyer and\r\n    Haywood, two strong, fearless leaders of labor. One was president\r\n    and the other was secretary of the Western Federation of Miners.\r\n    The ex-governor of Idaho had been mysteriously murdered. The crime,\r\n    at the time, was openly charged to the mine owners by the\r\n    socialists and miners. Nevertheless, in violation of the national\r\n    and state constitutions, and by means of conspiracy on the parts of\r\n    the governors of Idaho and Colorado, Moyer and Haywood were\r\n    kidnapped, thrown into jail, and charged with the murder. It was\r\n    this instance that provoked from Eugene V. Debs, national leader of\r\n    the American socialists at the time, the following words: \xe2\x80\x9c_The\r\n    labor leaders that cannot be bribed nor bullied, must be ambushed\r\n    and murdered. The only crime of Moyer and Haywood is that they have\r\n    been unswervingly true to the working class. The capitalists have\r\n    stolen our country, debauched our politics, defiled our judiciary,\r\n    and ridden over us rough-shod, and now they propose to murder those\r\n    who will not abjectly surrender to their brutal dominion. The\r\n    governors of Colorado and Idaho are but executing the mandates of\r\n    their masters, the Plutocracy. The issue is the Workers versus the\r\n    Plutocracy. If they strike the first violent blow, we will strike\r\n    the last._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nIN THE SHADOW OF SONOMA\r\n\r\n\r\nOf myself, during this period, there is not much to say. For six months\r\nI was kept in prison, though charged with no crime. I was a _suspect_\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nword of fear that all revolutionists were soon to come to know. But our\r\nown nascent secret service was beginning to work. By the end of my\r\nsecond month in prison, one of the jailers made himself known as a\r\nrevolutionist in touch with the organization. Several weeks later,\r\nJoseph Parkhurst, the prison doctor who had just been appointed, proved\r\nhimself to be a member of one of the Fighting Groups.\r\n\r\nThus, throughout the organization of the Oligarchy, our own\r\norganization, weblike and spidery, was insinuating itself. And so I was\r\nkept in touch with all that was happening in the world without. And\r\nfurthermore, every one of our imprisoned leaders was in contact with\r\nbrave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the Iron Heel. Though\r\nErnest lay in prison three thousand miles away, on the Pacific Coast, I\r\nwas in unbroken communication with him, and our letters passed\r\nregularly back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe leaders, in prison and out, were able to discuss and direct the\r\ncampaign. It would have been possible, within a few months, to have\r\neffected the escape of some of them; but since imprisonment proved no\r\nbar to our activities, it was decided to avoid anything premature.\r\nFifty-two Congressmen were in prison, and fully three hundred more of\r\nour leaders. It was planned that they should be delivered\r\nsimultaneously. If part of them escaped, the vigilance of the oligarchs\r\nmight be aroused so as to prevent the escape of the remainder. On the\r\nother hand, it was held that a simultaneous jail-delivery all over the\r\nland would have immense psychological influence on the proletariat. It\r\nwould show our strength and give confidence.\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged, when I was released at the end of six months, that\r\nI was to disappear and prepare a secure hiding-place for Ernest. To\r\ndisappear was in itself no easy thing. No sooner did I get my freedom\r\nthan my footsteps began to be dogged by the spies of the Iron Heel. It\r\nwas necessary that they should be thrown off the track, and that I\r\nshould win to California. It is laughable, the way this was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nAlready the passport system, modelled on the Russian, was developing. I\r\ndared not cross the continent in my own character. It was necessary\r\nthat I should be completely lost if ever I was to see Ernest again, for\r\nby trailing me after he escaped, he would be caught once more. Again, I\r\ncould not disguise myself as a proletarian and travel. There remained\r\nthe disguise of a member of the Oligarchy. While the arch-oligarchs\r\nwere no more than a handful, there were myriads of lesser ones of the\r\ntype, say, of Mr. Wickson\xe2\x80\x94men, worth a few millions, who were adherents\r\nof the arch-oligarchs. The wives and daughters of these lesser\r\noligarchs were legion, and it was decided that I should assume the\r\ndisguise of such a one. A few years later this would have been\r\nimpossible, because the passport system was to become so perfect that\r\nno man, woman, nor child in all the land was unregistered and\r\nunaccounted for in his or her movements.\r\n\r\nWhen the time was ripe, the spies were thrown off my track. An hour\r\nlater Avis Everhard was no more. At that time one Felice Van Verdighan,\r\naccompanied by two maids and a lap-dog, with another maid for the\r\nlap-dog,[1] entered a drawing-room on a Pullman,[2] and a few minutes\r\nlater was speeding west.\r\n\r\n [1] This ridiculous picture well illustrates the heartless conduct of\r\n the masters. While people starved, lap-dogs were waited upon by maids.\r\n This was a serious masquerade on the part of Avis Everhard. Life and\r\n death and the Cause were in the issue; therefore the picture must be\r\n accepted as a true picture. It affords a striking commentary of the\r\n times.\r\n\r\n [2] _Pullman_\xe2\x80\x94the designation of the more luxurious railway cars of\r\n the period and so named from the inventor.\r\n\r\nThe three maids who accompanied me were revolutionists. Two were\r\nmembers of the Fighting Groups, and the third, Grace Holbrook, entered\r\na group the following year, and six months later was executed by the\r\nIron Heel. She it was who waited upon the dog. Of the other two, Bertha\r\nStole disappeared twelve years later, while Anna Roylston still lives\r\nand plays an increasingly important part in the Revolution.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] Despite continual and almost inconceivable hazards, Anna Roylston\r\n lived to the royal age of ninety-one. As the Pococks defied the\r\n executioners of the Fighting Groups, so she defied the executioners of\r\n the Iron Heel. She bore a charmed life and prospered amid dangers and\r\n alarms. She herself was an executioner for the Fighting Groups, and,\r\n known as the Red Virgin, she became one of the inspired figures of the\r\n Revolution. When she was an old woman of sixty-nine she shot \xe2\x80\x9cBloody\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Halcliffe down in the midst of his armed escort and got away\r\n unscathed. In the end she died peaceably of old age in a secret refuge\r\n of the revolutionists in the Ozark mountains.\r\n\r\nWithout adventure we crossed the United States to California. When the\r\ntrain stopped at Sixteenth Street Station, in Oakland, we alighted, and\r\nthere Felice Van Verdighan, with her two maids, her lap-dog, and her\r\nlap-dog\xe2\x80\x99s maid, disappeared forever. The maids, guided by trusty\r\ncomrades, were led away. Other comrades took charge of me. Within half\r\nan hour after leaving the train I was on board a small fishing boat and\r\nout on the waters of San Francisco Bay. The winds baffled, and we\r\ndrifted aimlessly the greater part of the night. But I saw the lights\r\nof Alcatraz where Ernest lay, and found comfort in the thought of\r\nnearness to him. By dawn, what with the rowing of the fishermen, we\r\nmade the Marin Islands. Here we lay in hiding all day, and on the\r\nfollowing night, swept on by a flood tide and a fresh wind, we crossed\r\nSan Pablo Bay in two hours and ran up Petaluma Creek.\r\n\r\nHere horses were ready and another comrade, and without delay we were\r\naway through the starlight. To the north I could see the loom of Sonoma\r\nMountain, toward which we rode. We left the old town of Sonoma to the\r\nright and rode up a canyon that lay between outlying buttresses of the\r\nmountain. The wagon-road became a wood-road, the wood-road became a\r\ncow-path, and the cow-path dwindled away and ceased among the upland\r\npastures. Straight over Sonoma Mountain we rode. It was the safest\r\nroute. There was no one to mark our passing.\r\n\r\nDawn caught us on the northern brow, and in the gray light we dropped\r\ndown through chaparral into redwood canyons deep and warm with the\r\nbreath of passing summer. It was old country to me that I knew and\r\nloved, and soon I became the guide. The hiding-place was mine. I had\r\nselected it. We let down the bars and crossed an upland meadow. Next,\r\nwe went over a low, oak-covered ridge and descended into a smaller\r\nmeadow. Again we climbed a ridge, this time riding under red-limbed\r\nmadronos and manzanitas of deeper red. The first rays of the sun\r\nstreamed upon our backs as we climbed. A flight of quail thrummed off\r\nthrough the thickets. A big jackrabbit crossed our path, leaping\r\nswiftly and silently like a deer. And then a deer, a many-pronged buck,\r\nthe sun flashing red-gold from neck and shoulders, cleared the crest of\r\nthe ridge before us and was gone.\r\n\r\nWe followed in his wake a space, then dropped down a zigzag trail that\r\nhe disdained into a group of noble redwoods that stood about a pool of\r\nwater murky with minerals from the mountain side. I knew every inch of\r\nthe way. Once a writer friend of mine had owned the ranch; but he, too,\r\nhad become a revolutionist, though more disastrously than I, for he was\r\nalready dead and gone, and none knew where nor how. He alone, in the\r\ndays he had lived, knew the secret of the hiding-place for which I was\r\nbound. He had bought the ranch for beauty, and paid a round price for\r\nit, much to the disgust of the local farmers. He used to tell with\r\ngreat glee how they were wont to shake their heads mournfully at the\r\nprice, to accomplish ponderously a bit of mental arithmetic, and then\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t make six per cent on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was dead now, nor did the ranch descend to his children. Of all\r\nmen, it was now the property of Mr. Wickson, who owned the whole\r\neastern and northern slopes of Sonoma Mountain, running from the\r\nSpreckels estate to the divide of Bennett Valley. Out of it he had made\r\na magnificent deer-park, where, over thousands of acres of sweet slopes\r\nand glades and canyons, the deer ran almost in primitive wildness. The\r\npeople who had owned the soil had been driven away. A state home for\r\nthe feeble-minded had also been demolished to make room for the deer.\r\n\r\nTo cap it all, Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s hunting lodge was a quarter of a mile from my\r\nhiding-place. This, instead of being a danger, was an added security.\r\nWe were sheltered under the very \xc3\xa6gis of one of the minor oligarchs.\r\nSuspicion, by the nature of the situation, was turned aside. The last\r\nplace in the world the spies of the Iron Heel would dream of looking\r\nfor me, and for Ernest when he joined me, was Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s deer-park.\r\n\r\nWe tied our horses among the redwoods at the pool. From a cache behind\r\na hollow rotting log my companion brought out a variety of things,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfifty-pound sack of flour, tinned foods of all sorts, cooking utensils,\r\nblankets, a canvas tarpaulin, books and writing material, a great\r\nbundle of letters, a five-gallon can of kerosene, an oil stove, and,\r\nlast and most important, a large coil of stout rope. So large was the\r\nsupply of things that a number of trips would be necessary to carry\r\nthem to the refuge.\r\n\r\nBut the refuge was very near. Taking the rope and leading the way, I\r\npassed through a glade of tangled vines and bushes that ran between two\r\nwooded knolls. The glade ended abruptly at the steep bank of a stream.\r\nIt was a little stream, rising from springs, and the hottest summer\r\nnever dried it up. On every hand were tall wooded knolls, a group of\r\nthem, with all the seeming of having been flung there from some\r\ncareless Titan\xe2\x80\x99s hand. There was no bed-rock in them. They rose from\r\ntheir bases hundreds of feet, and they were composed of red volcanic\r\nearth, the famous wine-soil of Sonoma. Through these the tiny stream\r\nhad cut its deep and precipitous channel.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a scramble down to the stream bed, and, once on the bed,\r\nwe went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet. And then we came to the\r\ngreat hole. There was no warning of the existence of the hole, nor was\r\nit a hole in the common sense of the word. One crawled through\r\ntight-locked briers and branches, and found oneself on the very edge,\r\npeering out and down through a green screen. A couple of hundred feet\r\nin length and width, it was half of that in depth. Possibly because of\r\nsome fault that had occurred when the knolls were flung together, and\r\ncertainly helped by freakish erosion, the hole had been scooped out in\r\nthe course of centuries by the wash of water. Nowhere did the raw earth\r\nappear. All was garmented by vegetation, from tiny maiden-hair and\r\ngold-back ferns to mighty redwood and Douglas spruces. These great\r\ntrees even sprang out from the walls of the hole. Some leaned over at\r\nangles as great as forty-five degrees, though the majority towered\r\nstraight up from the soft and almost perpendicular earth walls.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect hiding-place. No one ever came there, not even the\r\nvillage boys of Glen Ellen. Had this hole existed in the bed of a\r\ncanyon a mile long, or several miles long, it would have been well\r\nknown. But this was no canyon. From beginning to end the length of the\r\nstream was no more than five hundred yards. Three hundred yards above\r\nthe hole the stream took its rise in a spring at the foot of a flat\r\nmeadow. A hundred yards below the hole the stream ran out into open\r\ncountry, joining the main stream and flowing across rolling and\r\ngrass-covered land.\r\n\r\nMy companion took a turn of the rope around a tree, and with me fast on\r\nthe other end lowered away. In no time I was on the bottom. And in but\r\na short while he had carried all the articles from the cache and\r\nlowered them down to me. He hauled the rope up and hid it, and before\r\nhe went away called down to me a cheerful parting.\r\n\r\nBefore I go on I want to say a word for this comrade, John Carlson, a\r\nhumble figure of the Revolution, one of the countless faithful ones in\r\nthe ranks. He worked for Wickson, in the stables near the hunting\r\nlodge. In fact, it was on Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s horses that we had ridden over\r\nSonoma Mountain. For nearly twenty years now John Carlson has been\r\ncustodian of the refuge. No thought of disloyalty, I am sure, has ever\r\nentered his mind during all that time. To betray his trust would have\r\nbeen in his mind a thing undreamed. He was phlegmatic, stolid to such a\r\ndegree that one could not but wonder how the Revolution had any meaning\r\nto him at all. And yet love of freedom glowed sombrely and steadily in\r\nhis dim soul. In ways it was indeed good that he was not flighty and\r\nimaginative. He never lost his head. He could obey orders, and he was\r\nneither curious nor garrulous. Once I asked how it was that he was a\r\nrevolutionist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a young man I was a soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in\r\nGermany. There all young men must be in the army. So I was in the army.\r\nThere was another soldier there, a young man, too. His father was what\r\nyou call an agitator, and his father was in jail for lese majesty\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nyou call speaking the truth about the Emperor. And the young man, the\r\nson, talked with me much about people, and work, and the robbery of the\r\npeople by the capitalists. He made me see things in new ways, and I\r\nbecame a socialist. His talk was very true and good, and I have never\r\nforgotten. When I came to the United States I hunted up the socialists.\r\nI became a member of a section\xe2\x80\x94that was in the day of the S. L. P. Then\r\nlater, when the split came, I joined the local of the S. P. I was\r\nworking in a livery stable in San Francisco then. That was before the\r\nEarthquake. I have paid my dues for twenty-two years. I am yet a\r\nmember, and I yet pay my dues, though it is very secret now. I will\r\nalways pay my dues, and when the cooperative commonwealth comes, I will\r\nbe glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft to myself, I proceeded to cook breakfast on the oil stove and to\r\nprepare my home. Often, in the early morning, or in the evening after\r\ndark, Carlson would steal down to the refuge and work for a couple of\r\nhours. At first my home was the tarpaulin. Later, a small tent was put\r\nup. And still later, when we became assured of the perfect security of\r\nthe place, a small house was erected. This house was completely hidden\r\nfrom any chance eye that might peer down from the edge of the hole. The\r\nlush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield. Also, the\r\nhouse was built against the perpendicular wall; and in the wall itself,\r\nshored by strong timbers, well drained and ventilated, we excavated two\r\nsmall rooms. Oh, believe me, we had many comforts. When Biedenbach, the\r\nGerman terrorist, hid with us some time later, he installed a\r\nsmoke-consuming device that enabled us to sit by crackling wood fires\r\non winter nights.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must say a word for that gentle-souled terrorist, than whom\r\nthere is no comrade in the Revolution more fearfully misunderstood.\r\nComrade Biedenbach did not betray the Cause. Nor was he executed by the\r\ncomrades as is commonly supposed. This canard was circulated by the\r\ncreatures of the Oligarchy. Comrade Biedenbach was absent-minded,\r\nforgetful. He was shot by one of our lookouts at the cave-refuge at\r\nCarmel, through failure on his part to remember the secret signals. It\r\nwas all a sad mistake. And that he betrayed his Fighting Group is an\r\nabsolute lie. No truer, more loyal man ever labored for the Cause.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] Search as we may through all the material of those times that has\r\n come down to us, we can find no clew to the Biedenbach here referred\r\n to. No mention is made of him anywhere save in the Everhard\r\n Manuscript.\r\n\r\nFor nineteen years now the refuge that I selected had been almost\r\ncontinuously occupied, and in all that time, with one exception, it has\r\nnever been discovered by an outsider. And yet it was only a quarter of\r\na mile from Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s hunting-lodge, and a short mile from the village\r\nof Glen Ellen. I was able, always, to hear the morning and evening\r\ntrains arrive and depart, and I used to set my watch by the whistle at\r\nthe brickyards.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] If the curious traveller will turn south from Glen Ellen, he will\r\n find himself on a boulevard that is identical with the old country\r\n road seven centuries ago. A quarter of a mile from Glen Ellen, after\r\n the second bridge is passed, to the right will be noticed a barranca\r\n that runs like a scar across the rolling land toward a group of wooded\r\n knolls. The barranca is the site of the ancient right of way that in\r\n the time of private property in land ran across the holding of one\r\n Chauvet, a French pioneer of California who came from his native\r\n country in the fabled days of gold. The wooded knolls are the same\r\n knolls referred to by Avis Everhard.\r\n    The Great Earthquake of 2368 A.D. broke off the side of one of\r\n    these knolls and toppled it into the hole where the Everhards made\r\n    their refuge. Since the finding of the Manuscript excavations have\r\n    been made, and the house, the two cave rooms, and all the\r\n    accumulated rubbish of long occupancy have been brought to light.\r\n    Many valuable relics have been found, among which, curious to\r\n    relate, is the smoke-consuming device of Biedenbach\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned in\r\n    the narrative. Students interested in such matters should read the\r\n    brochure of Arnold Bentham soon to be published.\r\n    A mile northwest from the wooded knolls brings one to the site of\r\n    Wake Robin Lodge at the junction of Wild-Water and Sonoma Creeks.\r\n    It may be noticed, in passing, that Wild- Water was originally\r\n    called Graham Creek and was so named on the early local maps. But\r\n    the later name sticks. It was at Wake Robin Lodge that Avis\r\n    Everhard later lived for short periods, when, disguised as an\r\n    agent-provocateur of the Iron Heel, she was enabled to play with\r\n    impunity her part among men and events. The official permission to\r\n    occupy Wake Robin Lodge is still on the records, signed by no less\r\n    a man than Wickson, the minor oligarch of the Manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTRANSFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must make yourself over again,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest wrote to me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\ncease to be. You must become another woman\xe2\x80\x94and not merely in the\r\nclothes you wear, but inside your skin under the clothes. You must make\r\nyourself over again so that even I would not know you\xe2\x80\x94your voice, your\r\ngestures, your mannerisms, your carriage, your walk, everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis command I obeyed. Every day I practised for hours in burying\r\nforever the old Avis Everhard beneath the skin of another woman whom I\r\nmay call my other self. It was only by long practice that such results\r\ncould be obtained. In the mere detail of voice intonation I practised\r\nalmost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed,\r\nautomatic. It was this automatic assumption of a r\xc3\xb4le that was\r\nconsidered imperative. One must become so adept as to deceive oneself.\r\nIt was like learning a new language, say the French. At first speech in\r\nFrench is self-conscious, a matter of the will. The student thinks in\r\nEnglish and then transmutes into French, or reads in French but\r\ntransmutes into English before he can understand. Then later, becoming\r\nfirmly grounded, automatic, the student reads, writes, and _thinks_ in\r\nFrench, without any recourse to English at all.\r\n\r\nAnd so with our disguises. It was necessary for us to practise until\r\nour assumed roles became real; until to be our original selves would\r\nrequire a watchful and strong exercise of will. Of course, at first,\r\nmuch was mere blundering experiment. We were creating a new art, and we\r\nhad much to discover. But the work was going on everywhere; masters in\r\nthe art were developing, and a fund of tricks and expedients was being\r\naccumulated. This fund became a sort of text-book that was passed on, a\r\npart of the curriculum, as it were, of the school of Revolution.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] Disguise did become a veritable art during that period. The\r\n revolutionists maintained schools of acting in all their refuges. They\r\n scorned accessories, such as wigs and beards, false eyebrows, and such\r\n aids of the theatrical actors. The game of revolution was a game of\r\n life and death, and mere accessories were traps. Disguise had to be\r\n fundamental, intrinsic, part and parcel of one\xe2\x80\x99s being, second nature.\r\n The Red Virgin is reported to have been one of the most adept in the\r\n art, to which must be ascribed her long and successful career.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that my father disappeared. His letters, which had\r\ncome to me regularly, ceased. He no longer appeared at our Pell Street\r\nquarters. Our comrades sought him everywhere. Through our secret\r\nservice we ransacked every prison in the land. But he was lost as\r\ncompletely as if the earth had swallowed him up, and to this day no\r\nclew to his end has been discovered.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] Disappearance was one of the horrors of the time. As a motif, in\r\n song and story, it constantly crops up. It was an inevitable\r\n concomitant of the subterranean warfare that raged through those three\r\n centuries. This phenomenon was almost as common in the oligarch class\r\n and the labor castes, as it was in the ranks of the revolutionists.\r\n Without warning, without trace, men and women, and even children,\r\n disappeared and were seen no more, their end shrouded in mystery.\r\n\r\nSix lonely months I spent in the refuge, but they were not idle months.\r\nOur organization went on apace, and there were mountains of work always\r\nwaiting to be done. Ernest and his fellow-leaders, from their prisons,\r\ndecided what should be done; and it remained for us on the outside to\r\ndo it. There was the organization of the mouth-to-mouth propaganda; the\r\norganization, with all its ramifications, of our spy system; the\r\nestablishment of our secret printing-presses; and the establishment of\r\nour underground railways, which meant the knitting together of all our\r\nmyriads of places of refuge, and the formation of new refuges where\r\nlinks were missing in the chains we ran over all the land.\r\n\r\nSo I say, the work was never done. At the end of six months my\r\nloneliness was broken by the arrival of two comrades. They were young\r\ngirls, brave souls and passionate lovers of liberty: Lora Peterson, who\r\ndisappeared in 1922, and Kate Bierce, who later married Du Bois,[3] and\r\nwho is still with us with eyes lifted to to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s sun, that heralds\r\nin the new age.\r\n\r\n [3] Du Bois, the present librarian of Ardis, is a lineal descendant of\r\n this revolutionary pair.\r\n\r\nThe two girls arrived in a flurry of excitement, danger, and sudden\r\ndeath. In the crew of the fishing boat that conveyed them across San\r\nPablo Bay was a spy. A creature of the Iron Heel, he had successfully\r\nmasqueraded as a revolutionist and penetrated deep into the secrets of\r\nour organization. Without doubt he was on my trail, for we had long\r\nsince learned that my disappearance had been cause of deep concern to\r\nthe secret service of the Oligarchy. Luckily, as the outcome proved, he\r\nhad not divulged his discoveries to any one. He had evidently delayed\r\nreporting, preferring to wait until he had brought things to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion by discovering my hiding-place and capturing me.\r\nHis information died with him. Under some pretext, after the girls had\r\nlanded at Petaluma Creek and taken to the horses, he managed to get\r\naway from the boat.\r\n\r\nPart way up Sonoma Mountain, John Carlson let the girls go on, leading\r\nhis horse, while he went back on foot. His suspicions had been aroused.\r\nHe captured the spy, and as to what then happened, Carlson gave us a\r\nfair idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fixed him,\xe2\x80\x9d was Carlson\xe2\x80\x99s unimaginative way of describing the\r\naffair. \xe2\x80\x9cI fixed him,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, while a sombre light burnt in his\r\neyes, and his huge, toil-distorted hands opened and closed eloquently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe made no noise. I hid him, and tonight I will go back and bury him\r\ndeep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring that period I used to marvel at my own metamorphosis. At times\r\nit seemed impossible, either that I had ever lived a placid, peaceful\r\nlife in a college town, or else that I had become a revolutionist\r\ninured to scenes of violence and death. One or the other could not be.\r\nOne was real, the other was a dream, but which was which? Was this\r\npresent life of a revolutionist, hiding in a hole, a nightmare? or was\r\nI a revolutionist who had somewhere, somehow, dreamed that in some\r\nformer existence I have lived in Berkeley and never known of life more\r\nviolent than teas and dances, debating societies, and lecture rooms?\r\nBut then I suppose this was a common experience of all of us who had\r\nrallied under the red banner of the brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\nI often remembered figures from that other life, and, curiously enough,\r\nthey appeared and disappeared, now and again, in my new life. There was\r\nBishop Morehouse. In vain we searched for him after our organization\r\nhad developed. He had been transferred from asylum to asylum. We traced\r\nhim from the state hospital for the insane at Napa to the one in\r\nStockton, and from there to the one in the Santa Clara Valley called\r\nAgnews, and there the trail ceased. There was no record of his death.\r\nIn some way he must have escaped. Little did I dream of the awful\r\nmanner in which I was to see him once again\xe2\x80\x94the fleeting glimpse of him\r\nin the whirlwind carnage of the Chicago Commune.\r\n\r\nJackson, who had lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and who had been the\r\ncause of my own conversion into a revolutionist, I never saw again; but\r\nwe all knew what he did before he died. He never joined the\r\nrevolutionists. Embittered by his fate, brooding over his wrongs, he\r\nbecame an anarchist\xe2\x80\x94not a philosophic anarchist, but a mere animal, mad\r\nwith hate and lust for revenge. And well he revenged himself. Evading\r\nthe guards, in the nighttime while all were asleep, he blew the\r\nPertonwaithe palace into atoms. Not a soul escaped, not even the\r\nguards. And in prison, while awaiting trial, he suffocated himself\r\nunder his blankets.\r\n\r\nDr. Hammerfield and Dr. Ballingford achieved quite different fates from\r\nthat of Jackson. They have been faithful to their salt, and they have\r\nbeen correspondingly rewarded with ecclesiastical palaces wherein they\r\ndwell at peace with the world. Both are apologists for the Oligarchy.\r\nBoth have grown very fat. \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Hammerfield,\xe2\x80\x9d as Ernest once said, \xe2\x80\x9chas\r\nsucceeded in modifying his metaphysics so as to give God\xe2\x80\x99s sanction to\r\nthe Iron Heel, and also to include much worship of beauty and to reduce\r\nto an invisible wraith the gaseous vertebrate described by Haeckel\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndifference between Dr. Hammerfield and Dr. Ballingford being that the\r\nlatter has made the God of the oligarchs a little more gaseous and a\r\nlittle less vertebrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Donnelly, the scab foreman at the Sierra Mills whom I encountered\r\nwhile investigating the case of Jackson, was a surprise to all of us.\r\nIn 1918 I was present at a meeting of the \xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds. Of all our\r\nFighting Groups this one was the most formidable, ferocious, and\r\nmerciless. It was really not a part of our organization. Its members\r\nwere fanatics, madmen. We dared not encourage such a spirit. On the\r\nother hand, though they did not belong to us, we remained on friendly\r\nterms with them. It was a matter of vital importance that brought me\r\nthere that night. I, alone in the midst of a score of men, was the only\r\nperson unmasked. After the business that brought me there was\r\ntransacted, I was led away by one of them. In a dark passage this guide\r\nstruck a match, and, holding it close to his face, slipped back his\r\nmask. For a moment I gazed upon the passion-wrought features of Peter\r\nDonnelly. Then the match went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted you to know it was me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in the darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nremember Dallas, the superintendent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded at recollection of the vulpine-faced superintendent of the\r\nSierra Mills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I got him first,\xe2\x80\x9d Donnelly said with pride. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas after that I\r\njoined the Reds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how comes it that you are here?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried. \xe2\x80\x9cYour wife and\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why. No,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on hastily, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis not\r\nrevenge for them. They died easily in their beds\xe2\x80\x94sickness, you see, one\r\ntime and another. They tied my arms while they lived. And now that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re gone, \xe2\x80\x99tis revenge for my blasted manhood I\xe2\x80\x99m after. I was once\r\nPeter Donnelly, the scab foreman. But to-night I\xe2\x80\x99m Number 27 of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds. Come on now, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you out of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore I heard of him afterward. In his own way he had told the truth\r\nwhen he said all were dead. But one lived, Timothy, and him his father\r\nconsidered dead because he had taken service with the Iron Heel in the\r\nMercenaries.[4] A member of the \xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds pledged himself to twelve\r\nannual executions. The penalty for failure was death. A member who\r\nfailed to complete his number committed suicide. These executions were\r\nnot haphazard. This group of madmen met frequently and passed wholesale\r\njudgments upon offending members and servitors of the Oligarchy. The\r\nexecutions were afterward apportioned by lot.\r\n\r\n [4] In addition to the labor castes, there arose another caste, the\r\n military. A standing army of professional soldiers was created,\r\n officered by members of the Oligarchy and known as the Mercenaries.\r\n This institution took the place of the militia, which had proved\r\n impracticable under the new regime. Outside the regular secret service\r\n of the Iron Heel, there was further established a secret service of\r\n the Mercenaries, this latter forming a connecting link between the\r\n police and the military.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the business that brought me there the night of my visit was\r\nsuch a trial. One of our own comrades, who for years had successfully\r\nmaintained himself in a clerical position in the local bureau of the\r\nsecret service of the Iron Heel, had fallen under the ban of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds and was being tried. Of course he was not present, and of\r\ncourse his judges did not know that he was one of our men. My mission\r\nhad been to testify to his identity and loyalty. It may be wondered how\r\nwe came to know of the affair at all. The explanation is simple. One of\r\nour secret agents was a member of the \xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds. It was necessary\r\nfor us to keep an eye on friend as well as foe, and this group of\r\nmadmen was not too unimportant to escape our surveillance.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Peter Donnelly and his son. All went well with\r\nDonnelly until, in the following year, he found among the sheaf of\r\nexecutions that fell to him the name of Timothy Donnelly. Then it was\r\nthat that clannishness, which was his to so extraordinary a degree,\r\nasserted itself. To save his son, he betrayed his comrades. In this he\r\nwas partially blocked, but a dozen of the \xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds were executed,\r\nand the group was well-nigh destroyed. In retaliation, the survivors\r\nmeted out to Donnelly the death he had earned by his treason.\r\n\r\nNor did Timothy Donnelly long survive. The \xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds pledged\r\nthemselves to his execution. Every effort was made by the Oligarchy to\r\nsave him. He was transferred from one part of the country to another.\r\nThree of the Reds lost their lives in vain efforts to get him. The\r\nGroup was composed only of men. In the end they fell back on a woman,\r\none of our comrades, and none other than Anna Roylston. Our Inner\r\nCircle forbade her, but she had ever a will of her own and disdained\r\ndiscipline. Furthermore, she was a genius and lovable, and we could\r\nnever discipline her anyway. She is in a class by herself and not\r\namenable to the ordinary standards of the revolutionists.\r\n\r\nDespite our refusal to grant permission to do the deed, she went on\r\nwith it. Now Anna Roylston was a fascinating woman. All she had to do\r\nwas to beckon a man to her. She broke the hearts of scores of our young\r\ncomrades, and scores of others she captured, and by their heart-strings\r\nled into our organization. Yet she steadfastly refused to marry. She\r\ndearly loved children, but she held that a child of her own would claim\r\nher from the Cause, and that it was the Cause to which her life was\r\ndevoted.\r\n\r\nIt was an easy task for Anna Roylston to win Timothy Donnelly. Her\r\nconscience did not trouble her, for at that very time occurred the\r\n_Nashville Massacre_, when the Mercenaries, Donnelly in command,\r\nliterally murdered eight hundred weavers of that city. But she did not\r\nkill Donnelly. She turned him over, a prisoner, to the \xe2\x80\x99Frisco Reds.\r\nThis happened only last year, and now she had been renamed. The\r\nrevolutionists everywhere are calling her the \xe2\x80\x9cRed Virgin.\xe2\x80\x9d[5]\r\n\r\n [5] It was not until the Second Revolt was crushed, that the \xe2\x80\x99Frisco\r\n Reds flourished again. And for two generations the Group flourished.\r\n Then an agent of the Iron Heel managed to become a member, penetrated\r\n all its secrets, and brought about its total annihilation. This\r\n occurred in 2002 A.D. The members were executed one at a time, at\r\n intervals of three weeks, and their bodies exposed in the labor-ghetto\r\n of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nColonel Ingram and Colonel Van Gilbert are two more familiar figures\r\nthat I was later to encounter. Colonel Ingram rose high in the\r\nOligarchy and became Minister to Germany. He was cordially detested by\r\nthe proletariat of both countries. It was in Berlin that I met him,\r\nwhere, as an accredited international spy of the Iron Heel, I was\r\nreceived by him and afforded much assistance. Incidentally, I may state\r\nthat in my dual r\xc3\xb4le I managed a few important things for the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nColonel Van Gilbert became known as \xe2\x80\x9cSnarling\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gilbert. His\r\nimportant part was played in drafting the new code after the Chicago\r\nCommune. But before that, as trial judge, he had earned sentence of\r\ndeath by his fiendish malignancy. I was one of those that tried him and\r\npassed sentence upon him. Anna Roylston carried out the execution.\r\n\r\nStill another figure arises out of the old life\xe2\x80\x94Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer. Least\r\nof all would I have expected again to meet this man, Joseph Hurd. It\r\nwas a strange meeting. Late at night, two years after the Chicago\r\nCommune, Ernest and I arrived together at the Benton Harbor refuge.\r\nThis was in Michigan, across the lake from Chicago. We arrived just at\r\nthe conclusion of the trial of a spy. Sentence of death had been\r\npassed, and he was being led away. Such was the scene as we came upon\r\nit. The next moment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors\r\nand flung himself at my feet, his arms clutching me about the knees in\r\na vicelike grip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy. As he turned his\r\nagonized face up to me, I recognized him as Joseph Hurd. Of all the\r\nterrible things I have witnessed, never have I been so unnerved as by\r\nthis frantic creature\xe2\x80\x99s pleading for life. He was mad for life. It was\r\npitiable. He refused to let go of me, despite the hands of a dozen\r\ncomrades. And when at last he was dragged shrieking away, I sank down\r\nfainting upon the floor. It is far easier to see brave men die than to\r\nhear a coward beg for life.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] The Benton Harbor refuge was a catacomb, the entrance of which was\r\n cunningly contrived by way of a well. It has been maintained in a fair\r\n state of preservation, and the curious visitor may to-day tread its\r\n labyrinths to the assembly hall, where, without doubt, occurred the\r\n scene described by Avis Everhard. Farther on are the cells where the\r\n prisoners were confined, and the death chamber where the executions\r\n took place. Beyond is the cemetery\xe2\x80\x94long, winding galleries hewn out of\r\n the solid rock, with recesses on either hand, wherein, tier above\r\n tier, lie the revolutionists just as they were laid away by their\r\n comrades long years agone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nA LOST OLIGARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in remembering the old life I have run ahead of my story into the\r\nnew life. The wholesale jail delivery did not occur until well along\r\ninto 1915. Complicated as it was, it was carried through without a\r\nhitch, and as a very creditable achievement it cheered us on in our\r\nwork. From Cuba to California, out of scores of jails, military\r\nprisons, and fortresses, in a single night, we delivered fifty-one of\r\nour fifty-two Congressmen, and in addition over three hundred other\r\nleaders. There was not a single instance of miscarriage. Not only did\r\nthey escape, but every one of them won to the refuges as planned. The\r\none comrade Congressman we did not get was Arthur Simpson, and he had\r\nalready died in Caba\xc3\xb1as after cruel tortures.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen months that followed was perhaps the happiest of my life\r\nwith Ernest. During that time we were never apart. Later, when we went\r\nback into the world, we were separated much. Not more impatiently do I\r\nawait the flame of to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s revolt than did I that night await the\r\ncoming of Ernest. I had not seen him for so long, and the thought of a\r\npossible hitch or error in our plans that would keep him still in his\r\nisland prison almost drove me mad. The hours passed like ages. I was\r\nall alone. Biedenbach, and three young men who had been living in the\r\nrefuge, were out and over the mountain, heavily armed and prepared for\r\nanything. The refuges all over the land were quite empty, I imagine, of\r\ncomrades that night.\r\n\r\nJust as the sky paled with the first warning of dawn, I heard the\r\nsignal from above and gave the answer. In the darkness I almost\r\nembraced Biedenbach, who came down first; but the next moment I was in\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s arms. And in that moment, so complete had been my\r\ntransformation, I discovered it was only by an effort of will that I\r\ncould be the old Avis Everhard, with the old mannerisms and smiles,\r\nphrases and intonations of voice. It was by strong effort only that I\r\nwas able to maintain my old identity; I could not allow myself to\r\nforget for an instant, so automatically imperative had become the new\r\npersonality I had created.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the little cabin, I saw Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s face in the light. With\r\nthe exception of the prison pallor, there was no change in him\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast, not much. He was my same lover-husband and hero. And yet there\r\nwas a certain ascetic lengthening of the lines of his face. But he\r\ncould well stand it, for it seemed to add a certain nobility of\r\nrefinement to the riotous excess of life that had always marked his\r\nfeatures. He might have been a trifle graver than of yore, but the\r\nglint of laughter still was in his eyes. He was twenty pounds lighter,\r\nbut in splendid physical condition. He had kept up exercise during the\r\nwhole period of confinement, and his muscles were like iron. In truth,\r\nhe was in better condition than when he had entered prison. Hours\r\npassed before his head touched pillow and I had soothed him off to\r\nsleep. But there was no sleep for me. I was too happy, and the fatigue\r\nof jail-breaking and riding horseback had not been mine.\r\n\r\nWhile Ernest slept, I changed my dress, arranged my hair differently,\r\nand came back to my new automatic self. Then, when Biedenbach and the\r\nother comrades awoke, with their aid I concocted a little conspiracy.\r\nAll was ready, and we were in the cave-room that served for kitchen and\r\ndining room when Ernest opened the door and entered. At that moment\r\nBiedenbach addressed me as Mary, and I turned and answered him. Then I\r\nglanced at Ernest with curious interest, such as any young comrade\r\nmight betray on seeing for the first time so noted a hero of the\r\nRevolution. But Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s glance took me in and questioned impatiently\r\npast and around the room. The next moment I was being introduced to him\r\nas Mary Holmes.\r\n\r\nTo complete the deception, an extra plate was laid, and when we sat\r\ndown to table one chair was not occupied. I could have cried with joy\r\nas I noted Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s increasing uneasiness and impatience. Finally he\r\ncould stand it no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded bluntly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is still asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\nIt was the crucial moment. But my voice was a strange voice, and in it\r\nhe recognized nothing familiar. The meal went on. I talked a great\r\ndeal, and enthusiastically, as a hero-worshipper might talk, and it was\r\nobvious that he was my hero. I rose to a climax of enthusiasm and\r\nworship, and, before he could guess my intention, threw my arms around\r\nhis neck and kissed him on the lips. He held me from him at arm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlength and stared about in annoyance and perplexity. The four men\r\ngreeted him with roars of laughter, and explanations were made. At\r\nfirst he was sceptical. He scrutinized me keenly and was half\r\nconvinced, then shook his head and would not believe. It was not until\r\nI became the old Avis Everhard and whispered secrets in his ear that\r\nnone knew but he and Avis Everhard, that he accepted me as his really,\r\ntruly wife.\r\n\r\nIt was later in the day that he took me in his arms, manifesting great\r\nembarrassment and claiming polygamous emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my Avis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you are also some one else. You are\r\ntwo women, and therefore you are my harem. At any rate, we are safe\r\nnow. If the United States becomes too hot for us, why I have qualified\r\nfor citizenship in Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1] At that time polygamy was still practised in Turkey.\r\n\r\nLife became for me very happy in the refuge. It is true, we worked hard\r\nand for long hours; but we worked together. We had each other for\r\neighteen precious months, and we were not lonely, for there was always\r\na coming and going of leaders and comrades\xe2\x80\x94strange voices from the\r\nunder-world of intrigue and revolution, bringing stranger tales of\r\nstrife and war from all our battle-line. And there was much fun and\r\ndelight. We were not mere gloomy conspirators. We toiled hard and\r\nsuffered greatly, filled the gaps in our ranks and went on, and through\r\nall the labour and the play and interplay of life and death we found\r\ntime to laugh and love. There were artists, scientists, scholars,\r\nmusicians, and poets among us; and in that hole in the ground culture\r\nwas higher and finer than in the palaces of wonder-cities of the\r\noligarchs. In truth, many of our comrades toiled at making beautiful\r\nthose same palaces and wonder-cities.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] This is not braggadocio on the part of Avis Everhard. The flower\r\n of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists. With the\r\n exception of a few of the musicians and singers, and of a few of the\r\n oligarchs, all the great creators of the period whose names have come\r\n down to us, were revolutionists.\r\n\r\nNor were we confined to the refuge itself. Often at night we rode over\r\nthe mountains for exercise, and we rode on Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s horses. If only he\r\nknew how many revolutionists his horses have carried! We even went on\r\npicnics to isolated spots we knew, where we remained all day, going\r\nbefore daylight and returning after dark. Also, we used Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s cream\r\nand butter,[3] and Ernest was not above shooting Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s quail and\r\nrabbits, and, on occasion, his young bucks.\r\n\r\n [3] Even as late as that period, cream and butter were still crudely\r\n extracted from cow\xe2\x80\x99s milk. The laboratory preparation of foods had not\r\n yet begun.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was a safe refuge. I have said that it was discovered only\r\nonce, and this brings me to the clearing up of the mystery of the\r\ndisappearance of young Wickson. Now that he is dead, I am free to\r\nspeak. There was a nook on the bottom of the great hole where the sun\r\nshone for several hours and which was hidden from above. Here we had\r\ncarried many loads of gravel from the creek-bed, so that it was dry and\r\nwarm, a pleasant basking place; and here, one afternoon, I was\r\ndrowsing, half asleep, over a volume of Mendenhall.[4] I was so\r\ncomfortable and secure that even his flaming lyrics failed to stir me.\r\n\r\n [4] In all the extant literature and documents of that period,\r\n continual reference is made to the poems of Rudolph Mendenhall. By his\r\n comrades he was called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Flame.\xe2\x80\x9d He was undoubtedly a great genius;\r\n yet, beyond weird and haunting fragments of his verse, quoted in the\r\n writings of others, nothing of his has come down to us. He was\r\n executed by the Iron Heel in 1928 A.D.\r\n\r\nI was aroused by a clod of earth striking at my feet. Then from above,\r\nI heard a sound of scrambling. The next moment a young man, with a\r\nfinal slide down the crumbling wall, alighted at my feet. It was Philip\r\nWickson, though I did not know him at the time. He looked at me coolly\r\nand uttered a low whistle of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and the next moment, cap in hand, he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbeg your pardon. I did not expect to find any one here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not so cool. I was still a tyro so far as concerned knowing how\r\nto behave in desperate circumstances. Later on, when I was an\r\ninternational spy, I should have been less clumsy, I am sure. As it\r\nwas, I scrambled to my feet and cried out the danger call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking at me searchingly.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he had no suspicion of our presence when making the\r\ndescent. I recognized this with relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose do you think I did it?\xe2\x80\x9d I countered. I was indeed\r\nclumsy in those days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nfriends about. Anyway, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some explanations to make. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike the look of it. You are trespassing. This is my father\xe2\x80\x99s land,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, Biedenbach, ever polite and gentle, said from\r\nbehind him in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHands up, my young sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Wickson put his hands up first, then turned to confront\r\nBiedenbach, who held a thirty-thirty automatic rifle on him. Wickson\r\nwas imperturbable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ho,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca nest of revolutionists\xe2\x80\x94and quite a hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nest\r\nit would seem. Well, you won\xe2\x80\x99t abide here long, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll abide here long enough to reconsider that statement,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBiedenbach said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in the meanwhile I must ask you to come\r\ninside with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInside?\xe2\x80\x9d The young man was genuinely astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you a catacomb\r\nhere? I have heard of such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and see,\xe2\x80\x9d Biedenbach answered with his adorable accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is unlawful,\xe2\x80\x9d was the protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by your law,\xe2\x80\x9d the terrorist replied significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut by our\r\nlaw, believe me, it is quite lawful. You must accustom yourself to the\r\nfact that you are in another world than the one of oppression and\r\nbrutality in which you have lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is room for argument there,\xe2\x80\x9d Wickson muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen stay with us and discuss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young fellow laughed and followed his captor into the house. He was\r\nled into the inner cave-room, and one of the young comrades left to\r\nguard him, while we discussed the situation in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nBiedenbach, with tears in his eyes, held that Wickson must die, and was\r\nquite relieved when we outvoted him and his horrible proposition. On\r\nthe other hand, we could not dream of allowing the young oligarch to\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll keep him and give him\r\nan education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bespeak the privilege, then, of enlightening him in jurisprudence,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBiedenbach cried.\r\n\r\nAnd so a decision was laughingly reached. We would keep Philip Wickson\r\na prisoner and educate him in our ethics and sociology. But in the\r\nmeantime there was work to be done. All trace of the young oligarch\r\nmust be obliterated. There were the marks he had left when descending\r\nthe crumbling wall of the hole. This task fell to Biedenbach, and,\r\nslung on a rope from above, he toiled cunningly for the rest of the day\r\ntill no sign remained. Back up the canyon from the lip of the hole all\r\nmarks were likewise removed. Then, at twilight, came John Carlson, who\r\ndemanded Wickson\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.\r\n\r\nThe young man did not want to give up his shoes, and even offered to\r\nfight for them, till he felt the horseshoer\xe2\x80\x99s strength in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. Carlson afterward reported several blisters and much grievous\r\nloss of skin due to the smallness of the shoes, but he succeeded in\r\ndoing gallant work with them. Back from the lip of the hole, where\r\nended the young man\xe2\x80\x99s obliterated trial, Carlson put on the shoes and\r\nwalked away to the left. He walked for miles, around knolls, over\r\nridges and through canyons, and finally covered the trail in the\r\nrunning water of a creek-bed. Here he removed the shoes, and, still\r\nhiding trail for a distance, at last put on his own shoes. A week later\r\nWickson got back his shoes.\r\n\r\nThat night the hounds were out, and there was little sleep in the\r\nrefuge. Next day, time and again, the baying hounds came down the\r\ncanyon, plunged off to the left on the trail Carlson had made for them,\r\nand were lost to ear in the farther canyons high up the mountain. And\r\nall the time our men waited in the refuge, weapons in hand\xe2\x80\x94automatic\r\nrevolvers and rifles, to say nothing of half a dozen infernal machines\r\nof Biedenbach\xe2\x80\x99s manufacture. A more surprised party of rescuers could\r\nnot be imagined, had they ventured down into our hiding-place.\r\n\r\nI have now given the true disappearance of Philip Wickson, one-time\r\noligarch, and, later, comrade in the Revolution. For we converted him\r\nin the end. His mind was fresh and plastic, and by nature he was very\r\nethical. Several months later we rode him, on one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorses, over Sonoma Mountains to Petaluma Creek and embarked him in a\r\nsmall fishing-launch. By easy stages we smuggled him along our\r\nunderground railway to the Carmel refuge.\r\n\r\nThere he remained eight months, at the end of which time, for two\r\nreasons, he was loath to leave us. One reason was that he had fallen in\r\nlove with Anna Roylston, and the other was that he had become one of\r\nus. It was not until he became convinced of the hopelessness of his\r\nlove affair that he acceded to our wishes and went back to his father.\r\nOstensibly an oligarch until his death, he was in reality one of the\r\nmost valuable of our agents. Often and often has the Iron Heel been\r\ndumbfounded by the miscarriage of its plans and operations against us.\r\nIf it but knew the number of its own members who are our agents, it\r\nwould understand. Young Wickson never wavered in his loyalty to the\r\nCause. In truth, his very death was incurred by his devotion to duty.\r\nIn the great storm of 1927, while attending a meeting of our leaders,\r\nhe contracted the pneumonia of which he died.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] The case of this young man was not unusual. Many young men of the\r\n Oligarchy, impelled by sense of right conduct, or their imaginations\r\n captured by the glory of the Revolution, ethically or romantically\r\n devoted their lives to it. In similar way, many sons of the Russian\r\n nobility played their parts in the earlier and protracted revolution\r\n in that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the long period of our stay in the refuge, we were kept closely\r\nin touch with what was happening in the world without, and we were\r\nlearning thoroughly the strength of the Oligarchy with which we were at\r\nwar. Out of the flux of transition the new institutions were forming\r\nmore definitely and taking on the appearance and attributes of\r\npermanence. The oligarchs had succeeded in devising a governmental\r\nmachine, as intricate as it was vast, that worked\xe2\x80\x94and this despite all\r\nour efforts to clog and hamper.\r\n\r\nThis was a surprise to many of the revolutionists. They had not\r\nconceived it possible. Nevertheless the work of the country went on.\r\nThe men toiled in the mines and fields\xe2\x80\x94perforce they were no more than\r\nslaves. As for the vital industries, everything prospered. The members\r\nof the great labor castes were contented and worked on merrily. For the\r\nfirst time in their lives they knew industrial peace. No more were they\r\nworried by slack times, strike and lockout, and the union label. They\r\nlived in more comfortable homes and in delightful cities of their\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94delightful compared with the slums and ghettos in which they had\r\nformerly dwelt. They had better food to eat, less hours of labor, more\r\nholidays, and a greater amount and variety of interests and pleasures.\r\nAnd for their less fortunate brothers and sisters, the unfavored\r\nlaborers, the driven people of the abyss, they cared nothing. An age of\r\nselfishness was dawning upon mankind. And yet this is not altogether\r\ntrue. The labor castes were honeycombed by our agents\xe2\x80\x94men whose eyes\r\nsaw, beyond the belly-need, the radiant figure of liberty and\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nAnother great institution that had taken form and was working smoothly\r\nwas the Mercenaries. This body of soldiers had been evolved out of the\r\nold regular army and was now a million strong, to say nothing of the\r\ncolonial forces. The Mercenaries constituted a race apart. They dwelt\r\nin cities of their own which were practically self-governed, and they\r\nwere granted many privileges. By them a large portion of the perplexing\r\nsurplus was consumed. They were losing all touch and sympathy with the\r\nrest of the people, and, in fact, were developing their own class\r\nmorality and consciousness. And yet we had thousands of our agents\r\namong them.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] The Mercenaries, in the last days of the Iron Heel, played an\r\n important r\xc3\xb4le. They constituted the balance of power in the struggles\r\n between the labor castes and the oligarchs, and now to one side and\r\n now to the other, threw their strength according to the play of\r\n intrigue and conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe oligarchs themselves were going through a remarkable and, it must\r\nbe confessed, unexpected development. As a class, they disciplined\r\nthemselves. Every member had his work to do in the world, and this work\r\nhe was compelled to do. There were no more idle-rich young men. Their\r\nstrength was used to give united strength to the Oligarchy. They served\r\nas leaders of troops and as lieutenants and captains of industry. They\r\nfound careers in applied science, and many of them became great\r\nengineers. They went into the multitudinous divisions of the\r\ngovernment, took service in the colonial possessions, and by tens of\r\nthousands went into the various secret services. They were, I may say,\r\napprenticed to education, to art, to the church, to science, to\r\nliterature; and in those fields they served the important function of\r\nmoulding the thought-processes of the nation in the direction of the\r\nperpetuity of the Oligarchy.\r\n\r\nThey were taught, and later they in turn taught, that what they were\r\ndoing was right. They assimilated the aristocratic idea from the moment\r\nthey began, as children, to receive impressions of the world. The\r\naristocratic idea was woven into the making of them until it became\r\nbone of them and flesh of them. They looked upon themselves as\r\nwild-animal trainers, rulers of beasts. From beneath their feet rose\r\nalways the subterranean rumbles of revolt. Violent death ever stalked\r\nin their midst; bomb and knife and bullet were looked upon as so many\r\nfangs of the roaring abysmal beast they must dominate if humanity were\r\nto persist. They were the saviours of humanity, and they regarded\r\nthemselves as heroic and sacrificing laborers for the highest good.\r\n\r\nThey, as a class, believed that they alone maintained civilization. It\r\nwas their belief that if ever they weakened, the great beast would\r\ningulf them and everything of beauty and wonder and joy and good in its\r\ncavernous and slime-dripping maw. Without them, anarchy would reign and\r\nhumanity would drop backward into the primitive night out of which it\r\nhad so painfully emerged. The horrid picture of anarchy was held always\r\nbefore their child\xe2\x80\x99s eyes until they, in turn, obsessed by this\r\ncultivated fear, held the picture of anarchy before the eyes of the\r\nchildren that followed them. This was the beast to be stamped upon, and\r\nthe highest duty of the aristocrat was to stamp upon it. In short, they\r\nalone, by their unremitting toil and sacrifice, stood between weak\r\nhumanity and the all-devouring beast; and they believed it, firmly\r\nbelieved it.\r\n\r\nI cannot lay too great stress upon this high ethical righteousness of\r\nthe whole oligarch class. This has been the strength of the Iron Heel,\r\nand too many of the comrades have been slow or loath to realize it.\r\nMany of them have ascribed the strength of the Iron Heel to its system\r\nof reward and punishment. This is a mistake. Heaven and hell may be the\r\nprime factors of zeal in the religion of a fanatic; but for the great\r\nmajority of the religious, heaven and hell are incidental to right and\r\nwrong. Love of the right, desire for the right, unhappiness with\r\nanything less than the right\xe2\x80\x94in short, right conduct, is the prime\r\nfactor of religion. And so with the Oligarchy. Prisons, banishment and\r\ndegradation, honors and palaces and wonder-cities, are all incidental.\r\nThe great driving force of the oligarchs is the belief that they are\r\ndoing right. Never mind the exceptions, and never mind the oppression\r\nand injustice in which the Iron Heel was conceived. All is granted. The\r\npoint is that the strength of the Oligarchy today lies in its satisfied\r\nconception of its own righteousness.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] Out of the ethical incoherency and inconsistency of capitalism,\r\n the oligarchs emerged with a new ethics, coherent and definite, sharp\r\n and severe as steel, the most absurd and unscientific and at the same\r\n time the most potent ever possessed by any tyrant class. The oligarchs\r\n believed their ethics, in spite of the fact that biology and evolution\r\n gave them the lie; and, because of their faith, for three centuries\r\n they were able to hold back the mighty tide of human progress\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n spectacle, profound, tremendous, puzzling to the metaphysical\r\n moralist, and one that to the materialist is the cause of many doubts\r\n and reconsiderations.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, the strength of the Revolution, during these frightful\r\ntwenty years, has resided in nothing else than the sense of\r\nrighteousness. In no other way can be explained our sacrifices and\r\nmartyrdoms. For no other reason did Rudolph Mendenhall flame out his\r\nsoul for the Cause and sing his wild swan-song that last night of life.\r\nFor no other reason did Hurlbert die under torture, refusing to the\r\nlast to betray his comrades. For no other reason has Anna Roylston\r\nrefused blessed motherhood. For no other reason has John Carlson been\r\nthe faithful and unrewarded custodian of the Glen Ellen Refuge. It does\r\nnot matter, young or old, man or woman, high or low, genius or clod, go\r\nwhere one will among the comrades of the Revolution, the motor-force\r\nwill be found to be a great and abiding desire for the right.\r\n\r\nBut I have run away from my narrative. Ernest and I well understood,\r\nbefore we left the refuge, how the strength of the Iron Heel was\r\ndeveloping. The labor castes, the Mercenaries, and the great hordes of\r\nsecret agents and police of various sorts were all pledged to the\r\nOligarchy. In the main, and ignoring the loss of liberty, they were\r\nbetter off than they had been. On the other hand, the great helpless\r\nmass of the population, the people of the abyss, was sinking into a\r\nbrutish apathy of content with misery. Whenever strong proletarians\r\nasserted their strength in the midst of the mass, they were drawn away\r\nfrom the mass by the oligarchs and given better conditions by being\r\nmade members of the labor castes or of the Mercenaries. Thus discontent\r\nwas lulled and the proletariat robbed of its natural leaders.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the people of the abyss was pitiable. Common school\r\neducation, so far as they were concerned, had ceased. They lived like\r\nbeasts in great squalid labor-ghettos, festering in misery and\r\ndegradation. All their old liberties were gone. They were labor-slaves.\r\nChoice of work was denied them. Likewise was denied them the right to\r\nmove from place to place, or the right to bear or possess arms. They\r\nwere not land serfs like the farmers. They were machine-serfs and\r\nlabor-serfs. When unusual needs arose for them, such as the building of\r\nthe great highways and air-lines, of canals, tunnels, subways, and\r\nfortifications, levies were made on the labor-ghettos, and tens of\r\nthousands of serfs, willy-nilly, were transported to the scene of\r\noperations. Great armies of them are toiling now at the building of\r\nArdis, housed in wretched barracks where family life cannot exist, and\r\nwhere decency is displaced by dull bestiality. In all truth, there in\r\nthe labor-ghettos is the roaring abysmal beast the oligarchs fear so\r\ndreadfully\xe2\x80\x94but it is the beast of their own making. In it they will not\r\nlet the ape and tiger die.\r\n\r\nAnd just now the word has gone forth that new levies are being imposed\r\nfor the building of Asgard, the projected wonder-city that will far\r\nexceed Ardis when the latter is completed.[3] We of the Revolution will\r\ngo on with that great work, but it will not be done by the miserable\r\nserfs. The walls and towers and shafts of that fair city will arise to\r\nthe sound of singing, and into its beauty and wonder will be woven, not\r\nsighs and groans, but music and laughter.\r\n\r\n [3] Ardis was completed in 1942 A.D., Asgard was not completed until\r\n 1984 A.D. It was fifty-two years in the building, during which time a\r\n permanent army of half a million serfs was employed. At times these\r\n numbers swelled to over a million\xe2\x80\x94without any account being taken of\r\n the hundreds of thousands of the labor castes and the artists.\r\n\r\nErnest was madly impatient to be out in the world and doing, for our\r\nill-fated First Revolt, that had miscarried in the Chicago Commune, was\r\nripening fast. Yet he possessed his soul with patience, and during this\r\ntime of his torment, when Hadly, who had been brought for the purpose\r\nfrom Illinois, made him over into another man[4] he revolved great\r\nplans in his head for the organization of the learned proletariat, and\r\nfor the maintenance of at least the rudiments of education amongst the\r\npeople of the abyss\xe2\x80\x94all this of course in the event of the First Revolt\r\nbeing a failure.\r\n\r\n [4] Among the Revolutionists were many surgeons, and in vivisection\r\n they attained marvellous proficiency. In Avis Everhard\xe2\x80\x99s words, they\r\n could literally make a man over. To them the elimination of scars and\r\n disfigurements was a trivial detail. They changed the features with\r\n such microscopic care that no traces were left of their handiwork. The\r\n nose was a favorite organ to work upon. Skin-grafting and\r\n hair-transplanting were among their commonest devices. The changes in\r\n expression they accomplished were wizard-like. Eyes and eyebrows,\r\n lips, mouths, and ears, were radically altered. By cunning operations\r\n on tongue, throat, larynx, and nasal cavities a man\xe2\x80\x99s whole\r\n enunciation and manner of speech could be changed. Desperate times\r\n give need for desperate remedies, and the surgeons of the Revolution\r\n rose to the need. Among other things, they could increase an adult\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n stature by as much as four or five inches and decrease it by one or\r\n two inches. What they did is to-day a lost art. We have no need for\r\n it.\r\n\r\nIt was not until January, 1917, that we left the refuge. All had been\r\narranged. We took our place at once as agents-provocateurs in the\r\nscheme of the Iron Heel. I was supposed to be Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s sister. By\r\noligarchs and comrades on the inside who were high in authority, place\r\nhad been made for us, we were in possession of all necessary documents,\r\nand our pasts were accounted for. With help on the inside, this was not\r\ndifficult, for in that shadow-world of secret service identity was\r\nnebulous. Like ghosts the agents came and went, obeying commands,\r\nfulfilling duties, following clews, making their reports often to\r\nofficers they never saw or cooperating with other agents they had never\r\nseen before and would never see again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE CHICAGO COMMUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs agents-provocateurs, not alone were we able to travel a great deal,\r\nbut our very work threw us in contact with the proletariat and with our\r\ncomrades, the revolutionists. Thus we were in both camps at the same\r\ntime, ostensibly serving the Iron Heel and secretly working with all\r\nour might for the Cause. There were many of us in the various secret\r\nservices of the Oligarchy, and despite the shakings-up and\r\nreorganizations the secret services have undergone, they have never\r\nbeen able to weed all of us out.\r\n\r\nErnest had largely planned the First Revolt, and the date set had been\r\nsomewhere early in the spring of 1918. In the fall of 1917 we were not\r\nready; much remained to be done, and when the Revolt was precipitated,\r\nof course it was doomed to failure. The plot of necessity was\r\nfrightfully intricate, and anything premature was sure to destroy it.\r\nThis the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe had planned to strike our first blow at the nervous system of the\r\nOligarchy. The latter had remembered the general strike, and had\r\nguarded against the defection of the telegraphers by installing\r\nwireless stations, in the control of the Mercenaries. We, in turn, had\r\ncountered this move. When the signal was given, from every refuge, all\r\nover the land, and from the cities, and towns, and barracks, devoted\r\ncomrades were to go forth and blow up the wireless stations. Thus at\r\nthe first shock would the Iron Heel be brought to earth and lie\r\npractically dismembered.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, other comrades were to blow up the bridges and\r\ntunnels and disrupt the whole network of railroads. Still further,\r\nother groups of comrades, at the signal, were to seize the officers of\r\nthe Mercenaries and the police, as well as all Oligarchs of unusual\r\nability or who held executive positions. Thus would the leaders of the\r\nenemy be removed from the field of the local battles that would\r\ninevitably be fought all over the land.\r\n\r\nMany things were to occur simultaneously when the signal went forth.\r\nThe Canadian and Mexican patriots, who were far stronger than the Iron\r\nHeel dreamed, were to duplicate our tactics. Then there were comrades\r\n(these were the women, for the men would be busy elsewhere) who were to\r\npost the proclamations from our secret presses. Those of us in the\r\nhigher employ of the Iron Heel were to proceed immediately to make\r\nconfusion and anarchy in all our departments. Inside the Mercenaries\r\nwere thousands of our comrades. Their work was to blow up the magazines\r\nand to destroy the delicate mechanism of all the war machinery. In the\r\ncities of the Mercenaries and of the labor castes similar programmes of\r\ndisruption were to be carried out.\r\n\r\nIn short, a sudden, colossal, stunning blow was to be struck. Before\r\nthe paralyzed Oligarchy could recover itself, its end would have come.\r\nIt would have meant terrible times and great loss of life, but no\r\nrevolutionist hesitates at such things. Why, we even depended much, in\r\nour plan, on the unorganized people of the abyss. They were to be\r\nloosed on the palaces and cities of the masters. Never mind the\r\ndestruction of life and property. Let the abysmal brute roar and the\r\npolice and Mercenaries slay. The abysmal brute would roar anyway, and\r\nthe police and Mercenaries would slay anyway. It would merely mean that\r\nvarious dangers to us were harmlessly destroying one another. In the\r\nmeantime we would be doing our own work, largely unhampered, and\r\ngaining control of all the machinery of society.\r\n\r\nSuch was our plan, every detail of which had to be worked out in\r\nsecret, and, as the day drew near, communicated to more and more\r\ncomrades. This was the danger point, the stretching of the conspiracy.\r\nBut that danger-point was never reached. Through its spy-system the\r\nIron Heel got wind of the Revolt and prepared to teach us another of\r\nits bloody lessons. Chicago was the devoted city selected for the\r\ninstruction, and well were we instructed.\r\n\r\nChicago[1] was the ripest of all\xe2\x80\x94Chicago which of old time was the city\r\nof blood and which was to earn anew its name. There the revolutionary\r\nspirit was strong. Too many bitter strikes had been curbed there in the\r\ndays of capitalism for the workers to forget and forgive. Even the\r\nlabor castes of the city were alive with revolt. Too many heads had\r\nbeen broken in the early strikes. Despite their changed and favorable\r\nconditions, their hatred for the master class had not died. This spirit\r\nhad infected the Mercenaries, of which three regiments in particular\r\nwere ready to come over to us _en masse_.\r\n\r\n [1] Chicago was the industrial inferno of the nineteenth century A.D.\r\n A curious anecdote has come down to us of John Burns, a great English\r\n labor leader and one time member of the British Cabinet. In Chicago,\r\n while on a visit to the United States, he was asked by a newspaper\r\n reporter for his opinion of that city. \xe2\x80\x9cChicago,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cis a\r\n pocket edition of hell.\xe2\x80\x9d Some time later, as he was going aboard his\r\n steamer to sail to England, he was approached by another reporter, who\r\n wanted to know if he had changed his opinion of Chicago. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\r\n have,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply. \xe2\x80\x9cMy present opinion is that hell is a pocket\r\n edition of Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChicago had always been the storm-centre of the conflict between labor\r\nand capital, a city of street-battles and violent death, with a\r\nclass-conscious capitalist organization and a class-conscious workman\r\norganization, where, in the old days, the very school-teachers were\r\nformed into labor unions and affiliated with the hod-carriers and\r\nbrick-layers in the American Federation of Labor. And Chicago became\r\nthe storm-centre of the premature First Revolt.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was precipitated by the Iron Heel. It was cleverly done.\r\nThe whole population, including the favored labor castes, was given a\r\ncourse of outrageous treatment. Promises and agreements were broken,\r\nand most drastic punishments visited upon even petty offenders. The\r\npeople of the abyss were tormented out of their apathy. In fact, the\r\nIron Heel was preparing to make the abysmal beast roar. And hand in\r\nhand with this, in all precautionary measures in Chicago, the Iron Heel\r\nwas inconceivably careless. Discipline was relaxed among the\r\nMercenaries that remained, while many regiments had been withdrawn and\r\nsent to various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to carry out this programme\xe2\x80\x94only several weeks. We\r\nof the Revolution caught vague rumors of the state of affairs, but had\r\nnothing definite enough for an understanding. In fact, we thought it\r\nwas a spontaneous spirit of revolt that would require careful curbing\r\non our part, and never dreamed that it was deliberately\r\nmanufactured\xe2\x80\x94and it had been manufactured so secretly, from the very\r\ninnermost circle of the Iron Heel, that we had got no inkling. The\r\ncounter-plot was an able achievement, and ably carried out.\r\n\r\nI was in New York when I received the order to proceed immediately to\r\nChicago. The man who gave me the order was one of the oligarchs, I\r\ncould tell that by his speech, though I did not know his name nor see\r\nhis face. His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake.\r\nPlainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered,\r\nthat we had been countermined. The explosion was ready for the flash of\r\npowder, and countless agents of the Iron Heel, including me, either on\r\nthe ground or being sent there, were to supply that flash. I flatter\r\nmyself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the\r\noligarch, but my heart was beating madly. I could almost have shrieked\r\nand flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final,\r\ncold-blooded instructions were given.\r\n\r\nOnce out of his presence, I calculated the time. I had just the moments\r\nto spare, if I were lucky, to get in touch with some local leader\r\nbefore catching my train. Guarding against being trailed, I made a rush\r\nof it for the Emergency Hospital. Luck was with me, and I gained access\r\nat once to comrade Galvin, the surgeon-in-chief. I started to gasp out\r\nmy information, but he stopped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI already know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly, though his Irish eyes were flashing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew what you had come for. I got the word fifteen minutes ago, and\r\nI have already passed it along. Everything shall be done here to keep\r\nthe comrades quiet. Chicago is to be sacrificed, but it shall be\r\nChicago alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you tried to get word to Chicago?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo telegraphic communication. Chicago is shut off.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hell there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and I saw his white hands clinch. Then he burst\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God! I wish I were going to be there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is yet a chance to stop it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cif nothing happens to the\r\ntrain and I can get there in time. Or if some of the other\r\nsecret-service comrades who have learned the truth can get there in\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou on the inside were caught napping this time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI nodded my head humbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very secret,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the inner chiefs could have\r\nknown up to to-day. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet penetrated that far, so we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nescape being kept in the dark. If only Ernest were here. Maybe he is in\r\nChicago now, and all is well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Galvin shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last news I heard of him was that he\r\nhad been sent to Boston or New Haven. This secret service for the enemy\r\nmust hamper him a lot, but it\xe2\x80\x99s better than lying in a refuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI started to go, and Galvin wrung my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep a stout heart,\xe2\x80\x9d were his parting words. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if the First Revolt\r\nis lost? There will be a second, and we will be wiser then. Good-by and\r\ngood luck. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever see you again. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nbe hell there, but I\xe2\x80\x99d give ten years of my life for your chance to be\r\nin it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Twentieth Century[2] left New York at six in the evening, and was\r\nsupposed to arrive at Chicago at seven next morning. But it lost time\r\nthat night. We were running behind another train. Among the travellers\r\nin my Pullman was comrade Hartman, like myself in the secret service of\r\nthe Iron Heel. He it was who told me of the train that immediately\r\npreceded us. It was an exact duplicate of our train, though it\r\ncontained no passengers. The idea was that the empty train should\r\nreceive the disaster were an attempt made to blow up the Twentieth\r\nCentury. For that matter there were very few people on the train\xe2\x80\x94only a\r\nbaker\xe2\x80\x99s dozen in our car.\r\n\r\n [2] This was reputed to be the fastest train in the world then. It was\r\n quite a famous train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be some big men on board,\xe2\x80\x9d Hartman concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cI noticed a\r\nprivate car on the rear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight had fallen when we made our first change of engine, and I walked\r\ndown the platform for a breath of fresh air and to see what I could\r\nsee. Through the windows of the private car I caught a glimpse of three\r\nmen whom I recognized. Hartman was right. One of the men was General\r\nAltendorff; and the other two were Mason and Vanderbold, the brains of\r\nthe inner circle of the Oligarchy\xe2\x80\x99s secret service.\r\n\r\nIt was a quiet moonlight night, but I tossed restlessly and could not\r\nsleep. At five in the morning I dressed and abandoned my bed.\r\n\r\nI asked the maid in the dressing-room how late the train was, and she\r\ntold me two hours. She was a mulatto woman, and I noticed that her face\r\nwas haggard, with great circles under the eyes, while the eyes\r\nthemselves were wide with some haunting fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, miss; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep well, I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d was her reply.\r\n\r\nI looked at her closely, and tried her with one of our signals. She\r\nresponded, and I made sure of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething terrible is going to happen in Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat fake[3] train in front of us. That and the troop-trains have made\r\nus late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [3] False.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroop-trains?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe line is thick with them. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been passing\r\nthem all night. And they\xe2\x80\x99re all heading for Chicago. And bringing them\r\nover the air-line\xe2\x80\x94that means business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a lover in Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d she added apologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s one of us,\r\nand he\xe2\x80\x99s in the Mercenaries, and I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor girl. Her lover was in one of the three disloyal regiments.\r\n\r\nHartman and I had breakfast together in the dining car, and I forced\r\nmyself to eat. The sky had clouded, and the train rushed on like a\r\nsullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day. The very\r\nnegroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was impending.\r\nOppression sat heavily upon them; the lightness of their natures had\r\nebbed out of them; they were slack and absent-minded in their service,\r\nand they whispered gloomily to one another in the far end of the car\r\nnext to the kitchen. Hartman was hopeless over the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded for the twentieth time, with a helpless\r\nshrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, all is ready. You can depend upon\r\nit that they\xe2\x80\x99re holding them like this, thirty or forty miles outside\r\nthe city, on every road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had reference to troop-trains on the side-track. The soldiers were\r\ncooking their breakfasts over fires built on the ground beside the\r\ntrack, and they looked up curiously at us as we thundered past without\r\nslackening our terrific speed.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet as we entered Chicago. It was evident nothing had\r\nhappened yet. In the suburbs the morning papers came on board the\r\ntrain. There was nothing in them, and yet there was much in them for\r\nthose skilled in reading between the lines that it was intended the\r\nordinary reader should read into the text. The fine hand of the Iron\r\nHeel was apparent in every column. Glimmerings of weakness in the armor\r\nof the Oligarchy were given. Of course, there was nothing definite. It\r\nwas intended that the reader should feel his way to these glimmerings.\r\nIt was cleverly done. As fiction, those morning papers of October 27th\r\nwere masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThe local news was missing. This in itself was a masterstroke. It\r\nshrouded Chicago in mystery, and it suggested to the average Chicago\r\nreader that the Oligarchy did not dare give the local news. Hints that\r\nwere untrue, of course, were given of insubordination all over the\r\nland, crudely disguised with complacent references to punitive measures\r\nto be taken. There were reports of numerous wireless stations that had\r\nbeen blown up, with heavy rewards offered for the detection of the\r\nperpetrators. Of course no wireless stations had been blown up. Many\r\nsimilar outrages, that dovetailed with the plot of the revolutionists,\r\nwere given. The impression to be made on the minds of the Chicago\r\ncomrades was that the general Revolt was beginning, albeit with a\r\nconfusing miscarriage in many details. It was impossible for one\r\nuninformed to escape the vague yet certain feeling that all the land\r\nwas ripe for the revolt that had already begun to break out.\r\n\r\nIt was reported that the defection of the Mercenaries in California had\r\nbecome so serious that half a dozen regiments had been disbanded and\r\nbroken, and that their members with their families had been driven from\r\ntheir own city and on into the labor-ghettos. And the California\r\nMercenaries were in reality the most faithful of all to their salt! But\r\nhow was Chicago, shut off from the rest of the world, to know? Then\r\nthere was a ragged telegram describing an outbreak of the populace in\r\nNew York City, in which the labor castes were joining, concluding with\r\nthe statement (intended to be accepted as a bluff[4]) that the troops\r\nhad the situation in hand.\r\n\r\n [4] A lie.\r\n\r\nAnd as the oligarchs had done with the morning papers, so had they done\r\nin a thousand other ways. These we learned afterward, as, for example,\r\nthe secret messages of the oligarchs, sent with the express purpose of\r\nleaking to the ears of the revolutionists, that had come over the\r\nwires, now and again, during the first part of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess the Iron Heel won\xe2\x80\x99t need our services,\xe2\x80\x9d Hartman remarked,\r\nputting down the paper he had been reading, when the train pulled into\r\nthe central depot. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wasted their time sending us here. Their plans\r\nhave evidently prospered better than they expected. Hell will break\r\nloose any second now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked down the train as we alighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey dropped that private car when the\r\npapers came aboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHartman was hopelessly depressed. I tried to cheer him up, but he\r\nignored my effort and suddenly began talking very hurriedly, in a low\r\nvoice, as we passed through the station. At first I could not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not been sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have told no one. I have\r\nbeen working on it for weeks, and I cannot make sure. Watch out for\r\nKnowlton. I suspect him. He knows the secrets of a score of our\r\nrefuges. He carries the lives of hundreds of us in his hands, and I\r\nthink he is a traitor. It\xe2\x80\x99s more a feeling on my part than anything\r\nelse. But I thought I marked a change in him a short while back. There\r\nis the danger that he has sold us out, or is going to sell us out. I am\r\nalmost sure of it. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t whisper my suspicions to a soul, but,\r\nsomehow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave Chicago alive. Keep your eye on\r\nKnowlton. Trap him. Find out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything more. It is only an\r\nintuition, and so far I have failed to find the slightest clew.\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\nwere just stepping out upon the sidewalk. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d Hartman concluded\r\nearnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your eyes upon Knowlton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Hartman was right. Before a month went by Knowlton paid for his\r\ntreason with his life. He was formally executed by the comrades in\r\nMilwaukee.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet on the streets\xe2\x80\x94too quiet. Chicago lay dead. There was no\r\nroar and rumble of traffic. There were not even cabs on the streets.\r\nThe surface cars and the elevated were not running. Only occasionally,\r\non the sidewalks, were there stray pedestrians, and these pedestrians\r\ndid not loiter. They went their ways with great haste and definiteness,\r\nwithal there was a curious indecision in their movements, as though\r\nthey expected the buildings to topple over on them or the sidewalks to\r\nsink under their feet or fly up in the air. A few gamins, however, were\r\naround, in their eyes a suppressed eagerness in anticipation of\r\nwonderful and exciting things to happen.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere, far to the south, the dull sound of an explosion came\r\nto our ears. That was all. Then quiet again, though the gamins had\r\nstartled and listened, like young deer, at the sound. The doorways to\r\nall the buildings were closed; the shutters to the shops were up. But\r\nthere were many police and watchmen in evidence, and now and again\r\nautomobile patrols of the Mercenaries slipped swiftly past.\r\n\r\nHartman and I agreed that it was useless to report ourselves to the\r\nlocal chiefs of the secret service. Our failure so to report would be\r\nexcused, we knew, in the light of subsequent events. So we headed for\r\nthe great labor-ghetto on the South Side in the hope of getting in\r\ncontact with some of the comrades. Too late! We knew it. But we could\r\nnot stand still and do nothing in those ghastly, silent streets. Where\r\nwas Ernest? I was wondering. What was happening in the cities of the\r\nlabor castes and Mercenaries? In the fortresses?\r\n\r\nAs if in answer, a great screaming roar went up, dim with distance,\r\npunctuated with detonation after detonation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the fortresses,\xe2\x80\x9d Hartman said. \xe2\x80\x9cGod pity those three regiments!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a crossing we noticed, in the direction of the stockyards, a\r\ngigantic pillar of smoke. At the next crossing several similar smoke\r\npillars were rising skyward in the direction of the West Side. Over the\r\ncity of the Mercenaries we saw a great captive war-balloon that burst\r\neven as we looked at it, and fell in flaming wreckage toward the earth.\r\nThere was no clew to that tragedy of the air. We could not determine\r\nwhether the balloon had been manned by comrades or enemies. A vague\r\nsound came to our ears, like the bubbling of a gigantic caldron a long\r\nway off, and Hartman said it was machine-guns and automatic rifles.\r\n\r\nAnd still we walked in immediate quietude. Nothing was happening where\r\nwe were. The police and the automobile patrols went by, and once half a\r\ndozen fire-engines, returning evidently from some conflagration. A\r\nquestion was called to the fireman by an officer in an automobile, and\r\nwe heard one shout in reply: \xe2\x80\x9cNo water! They\xe2\x80\x99ve blown up the mains!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve smashed the water supply,\xe2\x80\x9d Hartman cried excitedly to me. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\r\ncan do all this in a premature, isolated, abortive attempt, what can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe do in a concerted, ripened effort all over the land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe automobile containing the officer who had asked the question darted\r\non. Suddenly there was a deafening roar. The machine, with its human\r\nfreight, lifted in an upburst of smoke, and sank down a mass of\r\nwreckage and death.\r\n\r\nHartman was jubilant. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done! well done!\xe2\x80\x9d he was repeating, over\r\nand over, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe proletariat gets its lesson to-day, but it\r\ngives one, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolice were running for the spot. Also, another patrol machine had\r\nhalted. As for myself, I was in a daze. The suddenness of it was\r\nstunning. How had it happened? I knew not how, and yet I had been\r\nlooking directly at it. So dazed was I for the moment that I was\r\nscarcely aware of the fact that we were being held up by the police. I\r\nabruptly saw that a policeman was in the act of shooting Hartman. But\r\nHartman was cool and was giving the proper passwords. I saw the\r\nlevelled revolver hesitate, then sink down, and heard the disgusted\r\ngrunt of the policeman. He was very angry, and was cursing the whole\r\nsecret service. It was always in the way, he was averring, while\r\nHartman was talking back to him and with fitting secret-service pride\r\nexplaining to him the clumsiness of the police.\r\n\r\nThe next moment I knew how it had happened. There was quite a group\r\nabout the wreck, and two men were just lifting up the wounded officer\r\nto carry him to the other machine. A panic seized all of them, and they\r\nscattered in every direction, running in blind terror, the wounded\r\nofficer, roughly dropped, being left behind. The cursing policeman\r\nalongside of me also ran, and Hartman and I ran, too, we knew not why,\r\nobsessed with the same blind terror to get away from that particular\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nNothing really happened then, but everything was explained. The flying\r\nmen were sheepishly coming back, but all the while their eyes were\r\nraised apprehensively to the many-windowed, lofty buildings that\r\ntowered like the sheer walls of a canyon on each side of the street.\r\nFrom one of those countless windows the bomb had been thrown, but which\r\nwindow? There had been no second bomb, only a fear of one.\r\n\r\nThereafter we looked with speculative comprehension at the windows. Any\r\nof them contained possible death. Each building was a possible\r\nambuscade. This was warfare in that modern jungle, a great city. Every\r\nstreet was a canyon, every building a mountain. We had not changed much\r\nfrom primitive man, despite the war automobiles that were sliding by.\r\n\r\nTurning a corner, we came upon a woman. She was lying on the pavement,\r\nin a pool of blood. Hartman bent over and examined her. As for myself,\r\nI turned deathly sick. I was to see many dead that day, but the total\r\ncarnage was not to affect me as did this first forlorn body lying there\r\nat my feet abandoned on the pavement. \xe2\x80\x9cShot in the breast,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nHartman\xe2\x80\x99s report. Clasped in the hollow of her arm, as a child might be\r\nclasped, was a bundle of printed matter. Even in death she seemed loath\r\nto part with that which had caused her death; for when Hartman had\r\nsucceeded in withdrawing the bundle, we found that it consisted of\r\nlarge printed sheets, the proclamations of the revolutionists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nBut Hartman only cursed the Iron Heel, and we passed on. Often we were\r\nhalted by the police and patrols, but our passwords enabled us to\r\nproceed. No more bombs fell from the windows, the last pedestrians\r\nseemed to have vanished from the streets, and our immediate quietude\r\ngrew more profound; though the gigantic caldron continued to bubble in\r\nthe distance, dull roars of explosions came to us from all directions,\r\nand the smoke-pillars were towering more ominously in the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly a change came over the face of things. A tingle of excitement\r\nran along the air. Automobiles fled past, two, three, a dozen, and from\r\nthem warnings were shouted to us. One of the machines swerved wildly at\r\nhigh speed half a block down, and the next moment, already left well\r\nbehind it, the pavement was torn into a great hole by a bursting bomb.\r\nWe saw the police disappearing down the cross-streets on the run, and\r\nknew that something terrible was coming. We could hear the rising roar\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur brave comrades are coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Hartman said.\r\n\r\nWe could see the front of their column filling the street from gutter\r\nto gutter, as the last war-automobile fled past. The machine stopped\r\nfor a moment just abreast of us. A soldier leaped from it, carrying\r\nsomething carefully in his hands. This, with the same care, he\r\ndeposited in the gutter. Then he leaped back to his seat and the\r\nmachine dashed on, took the turn at the corner, and was gone from\r\nsight. Hartman ran to the gutter and stooped over the object.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep back,\xe2\x80\x9d he warned me.\r\n\r\nI could see he was working rapidly with his hands. When he returned to\r\nme the sweat was heavy on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI disconnected it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand just in the nick of time. The\r\nsoldier was clumsy. He intended it for our comrades, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nit enough time. It would have exploded prematurely. Now it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexplode at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything was happening rapidly now. Across the street and half a\r\nblock down, high up in a building, I could see heads peering out. I had\r\njust pointed them out to Hartman, when a sheet of flame and smoke ran\r\nalong that portion of the face of the building where the heads had\r\nappeared, and the air was shaken by the explosion. In places the stone\r\nfacing of the building was torn away, exposing the iron construction\r\nbeneath. The next moment similar sheets of flame and smoke smote the\r\nfront of the building across the street opposite it. Between the\r\nexplosions we could hear the rattle of the automatic pistols and\r\nrifles. For several minutes this mid-air battle continued, then died\r\nout. It was patent that our comrades were in one building, that\r\nMercenaries were in the other, and that they were fighting across the\r\nstreet. But we could not tell which was which\xe2\x80\x94which building contained\r\nour comrades and which the Mercenaries.\r\n\r\nBy this time the column on the street was almost on us. As the front of\r\nit passed under the warring buildings, both went into action again\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nbuilding dropping bombs into the street, being attacked from across the\r\nstreet, and in return replying to that attack. Thus we learned which\r\nbuilding was held by our comrades, and they did good work, saving those\r\nin the street from the bombs of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHartman gripped my arm and dragged me into a wide entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not our comrades,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in my ear.\r\n\r\nThe inner doors to the entrance were locked and bolted. We could not\r\nescape. The next moment the front of the column went by. It was not a\r\ncolumn, but a mob, an awful river that filled the street, the people of\r\nthe abyss, mad with drink and wrong, up at last and roaring for the\r\nblood of their masters. I had seen the people of the abyss before, gone\r\nthrough its ghettos, and thought I knew it; but I found that I was now\r\nlooking on it for the first time. Dumb apathy had vanished. It was now\r\ndynamic\xe2\x80\x94a fascinating spectacle of dread. It surged past my vision in\r\nconcrete waves of wrath, snarling and growling, carnivorous, drunk with\r\nwhiskey from pillaged warehouses, drunk with hatred, drunk with lust\r\nfor blood\xe2\x80\x94men, women, and children, in rags and tatters, dim ferocious\r\nintelligences with all the godlike blotted from their features and all\r\nthe fiendlike stamped in, apes and tigers, anaemic consumptives and\r\ngreat hairy beasts of burden, wan faces from which vampire society had\r\nsucked the juice of life, bloated forms swollen with physical grossness\r\nand corruption, withered hags and death\xe2\x80\x99s-heads bearded like\r\npatriarchs, festering youth and festering age, faces of fiends,\r\ncrooked, twisted, misshapen monsters blasted with the ravages of\r\ndisease and all the horrors of chronic innutrition\xe2\x80\x94the refuse and the\r\nscum of life, a raging, screaming, screeching, demoniacal horde.\r\n\r\nAnd why not? The people of the abyss had nothing to lose but the misery\r\nand pain of living. And to gain?\xe2\x80\x94nothing, save one final, awful glut of\r\nvengeance. And as I looked the thought came to me that in that rushing\r\nstream of human lava were men, comrades and heroes, whose mission had\r\nbeen to rouse the abysmal beast and to keep the enemy occupied in\r\ncoping with it.\r\n\r\nAnd now a strange thing happened to me. A transformation came over me.\r\nThe fear of death, for myself and for others, left me. I was strangely\r\nexalted, another being in another life. Nothing mattered. The Cause for\r\nthis one time was lost, but the Cause would be here to-morrow, the same\r\nCause, ever fresh and ever burning. And thereafter, in the orgy of\r\nhorror that raged through the succeeding hours, I was able to take a\r\ncalm interest. Death meant nothing, life meant nothing. I was an\r\ninterested spectator of events, and, sometimes swept on by the rush,\r\nwas myself a curious participant. For my mind had leaped to a star-cool\r\naltitude and grasped a passionless transvaluation of values. Had it not\r\ndone this, I know that I should have died.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile of the mob had swept by when we were discovered. A woman in\r\nfantastic rags, with cheeks cavernously hollow and with narrow black\r\neyes like burning gimlets, caught a glimpse of Hartman and me. She let\r\nout a shrill shriek and bore in upon us. A section of the mob tore\r\nitself loose and surged in after her. I can see her now, as I write\r\nthese lines, a leap in advance, her gray hair flying in thin tangled\r\nstrings, the blood dripping down her forehead from some wound in the\r\nscalp, in her right hand a hatchet, her left hand, lean and wrinkled, a\r\nyellow talon, gripping the air convulsively. Hartman sprang in front of\r\nme. This was no time for explanations. We were well dressed, and that\r\nwas enough. His fist shot out, striking the woman between her burning\r\neyes. The impact of the blow drove her backward, but she struck the\r\nwall of her on-coming fellows and bounced forward again, dazed and\r\nhelpless, the brandished hatchet falling feebly on Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe next moment I knew not what was happening. I was overborne by the\r\ncrowd. The confined space was filled with shrieks and yells and curses.\r\nBlows were falling on me. Hands were ripping and tearing at my flesh\r\nand garments. I felt that I was being torn to pieces. I was being borne\r\ndown, suffocated. Some strong hand gripped my shoulder in the thick of\r\nthe press and was dragging fiercely at me. Between pain and pressure I\r\nfainted. Hartman never came out of that entrance. He had shielded me\r\nand received the first brunt of the attack. This had saved me, for the\r\njam had quickly become too dense for anything more than the mad\r\ngripping and tearing of hands.\r\n\r\nI came to in the midst of wild movement. All about me was the same\r\nmovement. I had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was sweeping\r\nme I knew not whither. Fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in\r\nmy lungs. Faint and dizzy, I was vaguely aware of a strong arm around\r\nmy body under the arms, and half-lifting me and dragging me along.\r\nFeebly my own limbs were helping me. In front of me I could see the\r\nmoving back of a man\xe2\x80\x99s coat. It had been slit from top to bottom along\r\nthe centre seam, and it pulsed rhythmically, the slit opening and\r\nclosing regularly with every leap of the wearer. This phenomenon\r\nfascinated me for a time, while my senses were coming back to me. Next\r\nI became aware of stinging cheeks and nose, and could feel blood\r\ndripping on my face. My hat was gone. My hair was down and flying, and\r\nfrom the stinging of the scalp I managed to recollect a hand in the\r\npress of the entrance that had torn at my hair. My chest and arms were\r\nbruised and aching in a score of places.\r\n\r\nMy brain grew clearer, and I turned as I ran and looked at the man who\r\nwas holding me up. He it was who had dragged me out and saved me. He\r\nnoticed my movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you on the instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI failed to recognize him, but before I could speak I trod upon\r\nsomething that was alive and that squirmed under my foot. I was swept\r\non by those behind and could not look down and see, and yet I knew that\r\nit was a woman who had fallen and who was being trampled into the\r\npavement by thousands of successive feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Garthwaite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was bearded and gaunt and dirty, but I succeeded in remembering him\r\nas the stalwart youth that had spent several months in our Glen Ellen\r\nrefuge three years before. He passed me the signals of the Iron Heel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsecret service, in token that he, too, was in its employ.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get you out of this as soon as I can get a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cBut watch your footing. On your life don\xe2\x80\x99t stumble and go down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll things happened abruptly on that day, and with an abruptness that\r\nwas sickening the mob checked itself. I came in violent collision with\r\na large woman in front of me (the man with the split coat had\r\nvanished), while those behind collided against me. A devilish\r\npandemonium reigned,\xe2\x80\x94shrieks, curses, and cries of death, while above\r\nall rose the churning rattle of machine-guns and the put-a-put,\r\nput-a-put of rifles. At first I could make out nothing. People were\r\nfalling about me right and left. The woman in front doubled up and went\r\ndown, her hands on her abdomen in a frenzied clutch. A man was\r\nquivering against my legs in a death-struggle.\r\n\r\nIt came to me that we were at the head of the column. Half a mile of it\r\nhad disappeared\xe2\x80\x94where or how I never learned. To this day I do not know\r\nwhat became of that half-mile of humanity\xe2\x80\x94whether it was blotted out by\r\nsome frightful bolt of war, whether it was scattered and destroyed\r\npiecemeal, or whether it escaped. But there we were, at the head of the\r\ncolumn instead of in its middle, and we were being swept out of life by\r\na torrent of shrieking lead.\r\n\r\nAs soon as death had thinned the jam, Garthwaite, still grasping my\r\narm, led a rush of survivors into the wide entrance of an office\r\nbuilding. Here, at the rear, against the doors, we were pressed by a\r\npanting, gasping mass of creatures. For some time we remained in this\r\nposition without a change in the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it beautifully,\xe2\x80\x9d Garthwaite was lamenting to me. \xe2\x80\x9cRan you right\r\ninto a trap. We had a gambler\xe2\x80\x99s chance in the street, but in here there\r\nis no chance at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over but the shouting. Vive la\r\nRevolution!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, what he expected, began. The Mercenaries were killing without\r\nquarter. At first, the surge back upon us was crushing, but as the\r\nkilling continued the pressure was eased. The dead and dying went down\r\nand made room. Garthwaite put his mouth to my ear and shouted, but in\r\nthe frightful din I could not catch what he said. He did not wait. He\r\nseized me and threw me down. Next he dragged a dying woman over on top\r\nof me, and, with much squeezing and shoving, crawled in beside me and\r\npartly over me. A mound of dead and dying began to pile up over us, and\r\nover this mound, pawing and moaning, crept those that still survived.\r\nBut these, too, soon ceased, and a semi-silence settled down, broken by\r\ngroans and sobs and sounds of strangulation.\r\n\r\nI should have been crushed had it not been for Garthwaite. As it was,\r\nit seemed inconceivable that I could bear the weight I did and live.\r\nAnd yet, outside of pain, the only feeling I possessed was one of\r\ncuriosity. How was it going to end? What would death be like? Thus did\r\nI receive my red baptism in that Chicago shambles. Prior to that, death\r\nto me had been a theory; but ever afterward death has been a simple\r\nfact that does not matter, it is so easy.\r\n\r\nBut the Mercenaries were not content with what they had done. They\r\ninvaded the entrance, killing the wounded and searching out the unhurt\r\nthat, like ourselves, were playing dead. I remember one man they\r\ndragged out of a heap, who pleaded abjectly until a revolver shot cut\r\nhim short. Then there was a woman who charged from a heap, snarling and\r\nshooting. She fired six shots before they got her, though what damage\r\nshe did we could not know. We could follow these tragedies only by the\r\nsound. Every little while flurries like this occurred, each flurry\r\nculminating in the revolver shot that put an end to it. In the\r\nintervals we could hear the soldiers talking and swearing as they\r\nrummaged among the carcasses, urged on by their officers to hurry up.\r\n\r\nAt last they went to work on our heap, and we could feel the pressure\r\ndiminish as they dragged away the dead and wounded. Garthwaite began\r\nuttering aloud the signals. At first he was not heard. Then he raised\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to that,\xe2\x80\x9d we heard a soldier say. And next the sharp voice of\r\nan officer. \xe2\x80\x9cHold on there! Careful as you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, that first breath of air as we were dragged out! Garthwaite did the\r\ntalking at first, but I was compelled to undergo a brief examination to\r\nprove service with the Iron Heel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgents-provocateurs all right,\xe2\x80\x9d was the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion. He was a\r\nbeardless young fellow, a cadet, evidently, of some great oligarch\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a hell of a job,\xe2\x80\x9d Garthwaite grumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and\r\nresign and get into the army. You fellows have a snap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve earned it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the young officer\xe2\x80\x99s answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got some\r\npull, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if it can be managed. I can tell them how I found\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took Garthwaite\xe2\x80\x99s name and number, then turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be married,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered lightly, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nout of it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so we talked, while the killing of the wounded went on. It is all a\r\ndream, now, as I look back on it; but at the time it was the most\r\nnatural thing in the world. Garthwaite and the young officer fell into\r\nan animated conversation over the difference between so-called modern\r\nwarfare and the present street-fighting and sky-scraper fighting that\r\nwas taking place all over the city. I followed them intently, fixing up\r\nmy hair at the same time and pinning together my torn skirts. And all\r\nthe time the killing of the wounded went on. Sometimes the revolver\r\nshots drowned the voices of Garthwaite and the officer, and they were\r\ncompelled to repeat what they had been saying.\r\n\r\nI lived through three days of the Chicago Commune, and the vastness of\r\nit and of the slaughter may be imagined when I say that in all that\r\ntime I saw practically nothing outside the killing of the people of the\r\nabyss and the mid-air fighting between sky-scrapers. I really saw\r\nnothing of the heroic work done by the comrades. I could hear the\r\nexplosions of their mines and bombs, and see the smoke of their\r\nconflagrations, and that was all. The mid-air part of one great deed I\r\nsaw, however, and that was the balloon attacks made by our comrades on\r\nthe fortresses. That was on the second day. The three disloyal\r\nregiments had been destroyed in the fortresses to the last man. The\r\nfortresses were crowded with Mercenaries, the wind blew in the right\r\ndirection, and up went our balloons from one of the office buildings in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nNow Biedenbach, after he left Glen Ellen, had invented a most powerful\r\nexplosive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexpedite\xe2\x80\x9d he called it. This was the weapon the balloons\r\nused. They were only hot-air balloons, clumsily and hastily made, but\r\nthey did the work. I saw it all from the top of an office building. The\r\nfirst balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the\r\ncountry; but we learned about it afterward. Burton and O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan were\r\nin it. As they were descending they swept across a railroad directly\r\nover a troop-train that was heading at full speed for Chicago. They\r\ndropped their whole supply of expedite upon the locomotive. The\r\nresulting wreck tied the line up for days. And the best of it was that,\r\nreleased from the weight of expedite, the balloon shot up into the air\r\nand did not come down for half a dozen miles, both heroes escaping\r\nunharmed.\r\n\r\nThe second balloon was a failure. Its flight was lame. It floated too\r\nlow and was shot full of holes before it could reach the fortresses.\r\nHerford and Guinness were in it, and they were blown to pieces along\r\nwith the field into which they fell. Biedenbach was in despair\xe2\x80\x94we heard\r\nall about it afterward\xe2\x80\x94and he went up alone in the third balloon. He,\r\ntoo, made a low flight, but he was in luck, for they failed seriously\r\nto puncture his balloon. I can see it now as I did then, from the lofty\r\ntop of the building\xe2\x80\x94that inflated bag drifting along the air, and that\r\ntiny speck of a man clinging on beneath. I could not see the fortress,\r\nbut those on the roof with me said he was directly over it. I did not\r\nsee the expedite fall when he cut it loose. But I did see the balloon\r\nsuddenly leap up into the sky. An appreciable time after that the great\r\ncolumn of the explosion towered in the air, and after that, in turn, I\r\nheard the roar of it. Biedenbach the gentle had destroyed a fortress.\r\nTwo other balloons followed at the same time. One was blown to pieces\r\nin the air, the expedite exploding, and the shock of it disrupted the\r\nsecond balloon, which fell prettily into the remaining fortress. It\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been better planned, though the two comrades in it\r\nsacrificed their lives.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the people of the abyss. My experiences were confined\r\nto them. They raged and slaughtered and destroyed all over the city\r\nproper, and were in turn destroyed; but never once did they succeed in\r\nreaching the city of the oligarchs over on the west side. The oligarchs\r\nhad protected themselves well. No matter what destruction was wreaked\r\nin the heart of the city, they, and their womenkind and children, were\r\nto escape hurt. I am told that their children played in the parks\r\nduring those terrible days and that their favorite game was an\r\nimitation of their elders stamping upon the proletariat.\r\n\r\nBut the Mercenaries found it no easy task to cope with the people of\r\nthe abyss and at the same time fight with the comrades. Chicago was\r\ntrue to her traditions, and though a generation of revolutionists was\r\nwiped out, it took along with it pretty close to a generation of its\r\nenemies. Of course, the Iron Heel kept the figures secret, but, at a\r\nvery conservative estimate, at least one hundred and thirty thousand\r\nMercenaries were slain. But the comrades had no chance. Instead of the\r\nwhole country being hand in hand in revolt, they were all alone, and\r\nthe total strength of the Oligarchy could have been directed against\r\nthem if necessary. As it was, hour after hour, day after day, in\r\nendless train-loads, by hundreds of thousands, the Mercenaries were\r\nhurled into Chicago.\r\n\r\nAnd there were so many of the people of the abyss! Tiring of the\r\nslaughter, a great herding movement was begun by the soldiers, the\r\nintent of which was to drive the street mobs, like cattle, into Lake\r\nMichigan. It was at the beginning of this movement that Garthwaite and\r\nI had encountered the young officer. This herding movement was\r\npractically a failure, thanks to the splendid work of the comrades.\r\nInstead of the great host the Mercenaries had hoped to gather together,\r\nthey succeeded in driving no more than forty thousand of the wretches\r\ninto the lake. Time and again, when a mob of them was well in hand and\r\nbeing driven along the streets to the water, the comrades would create\r\na diversion, and the mob would escape through the consequent hole torn\r\nin the encircling net.\r\n\r\nGarthwaite and I saw an example of this shortly after meeting with the\r\nyoung officer. The mob of which we had been a part, and which had been\r\nput in retreat, was prevented from escaping to the south and east by\r\nstrong bodies of troops. The troops we had fallen in with had held it\r\nback on the west. The only outlet was north, and north it went toward\r\nthe lake, driven on from east and west and south by machine-gun fire\r\nand automatics. Whether it divined that it was being driven toward the\r\nlake, or whether it was merely a blind squirm of the monster, I do not\r\nknow; but at any rate the mob took a cross street to the west, turned\r\ndown the next street, and came back upon its track, heading south\r\ntoward the great ghetto.\r\n\r\nGarthwaite and I at that time were trying to make our way westward to\r\nget out of the territory of street-fighting, and we were caught right\r\nin the thick of it again. As we came to the corner we saw the howling\r\nmob bearing down upon us. Garthwaite seized my arm and we were just\r\nstarting to run, when he dragged me back from in front of the wheels of\r\nhalf a dozen war automobiles, equipped with machine-guns, that were\r\nrushing for the spot. Behind them came the soldiers with their\r\nautomatic rifles. By the time they took position, the mob was upon\r\nthem, and it looked as though they would be overwhelmed before they\r\ncould get into action.\r\n\r\nHere and there a soldier was discharging his rifle, but this scattered\r\nfire had no effect in checking the mob. On it came, bellowing with\r\nbrute rage. It seemed the machine-guns could not get started. The\r\nautomobiles on which they were mounted blocked the street, compelling\r\nthe soldiers to find positions in, between, and on the sidewalks. More\r\nand more soldiers were arriving, and in the jam we were unable to get\r\naway. Garthwaite held me by the arm, and we pressed close against the\r\nfront of a building.\r\n\r\nThe mob was no more than twenty-five feet away when the machine-guns\r\nopened up; but before that flaming sheet of death nothing could live.\r\nThe mob came on, but it could not advance. It piled up in a heap, a\r\nmound, a huge and growing wave of dead and dying. Those behind urged\r\non, and the column, from gutter to gutter, telescoped upon itself.\r\nWounded creatures, men and women, were vomited over the top of that\r\nawful wave and fell squirming down the face of it till they threshed\r\nabout under the automobiles and against the legs of the soldiers. The\r\nlatter bayoneted the struggling wretches, though one I saw who gained\r\nhis feet and flew at a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s throat with his teeth. Together they\r\nwent down, soldier and slave, into the welter.\r\n\r\nThe firing ceased. The work was done. The mob had been stopped in its\r\nwild attempt to break through. Orders were being given to clear the\r\nwheels of the war-machines. They could not advance over that wave of\r\ndead, and the idea was to run them down the cross street. The soldiers\r\nwere dragging the bodies away from the wheels when it happened. We\r\nlearned afterward how it happened. A block distant a hundred of our\r\ncomrades had been holding a building. Across roofs and through\r\nbuildings they made their way, till they found themselves looking down\r\nupon the close-packed soldiers. Then it was counter-massacre.\r\n\r\nWithout warning, a shower of bombs fell from the top of the building.\r\nThe automobiles were blown to fragments, along with many soldiers. We,\r\nwith the survivors, swept back in mad retreat. Half a block down\r\nanother building opened fire on us. As the soldiers had carpeted the\r\nstreet with dead slaves, so, in turn, did they themselves become\r\ncarpet. Garthwaite and I bore charmed lives. As we had done before, so\r\nagain we sought shelter in an entrance. But he was not to be caught\r\nnapping this time. As the roar of the bombs died away, he began peering\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mob\xe2\x80\x99s coming back!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get out of\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe fled, hand in hand, down the bloody pavement, slipping and sliding,\r\nand making for the corner. Down the cross street we could see a few\r\nsoldiers still running. Nothing was happening to them. The way was\r\nclear. So we paused a moment and looked back. The mob came on slowly.\r\nIt was busy arming itself with the rifles of the slain and killing the\r\nwounded. We saw the end of the young officer who had rescued us. He\r\npainfully lifted himself on his elbow and turned loose with his\r\nautomatic pistol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere goes my chance of promotion,\xe2\x80\x9d Garthwaite laughed, as a woman\r\nbore down on the wounded man, brandishing a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s cleaver. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non. It\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong direction, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get out somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd we fled eastward through the quiet streets, prepared at every cross\r\nstreet for anything to happen. To the south a monster conflagration was\r\nfilling the sky, and we knew that the great ghetto was burning. At last\r\nI sank down on the sidewalk. I was exhausted and could go no farther. I\r\nwas bruised and sore and aching in every limb; yet I could not escape\r\nsmiling at Garthwaite, who was rolling a cigarette and saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m making a mess of rescuing you, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t get head nor\r\ntail of the situation. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a mess. Every time we try to break out,\r\nsomething happens and we\xe2\x80\x99re turned back. We\xe2\x80\x99re only a couple of blocks\r\nnow from where I got you out of that entrance. Friend and foe are all\r\nmixed up. It\xe2\x80\x99s chaos. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell who is in those darned buildings.\r\nTry to find out, and you get a bomb on your head. Try to go peaceably\r\non your way, and you run into a mob and are killed by machine-guns, or\r\nyou run into the Mercenaries and are killed by your own comrades from a\r\nroof. And on the top of it all the mob comes along and kills you, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head dolefully, lighted his cigarette, and sat down beside\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m that hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI could eat cobblestones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was on his feet again and out in the street prying\r\nup a cobblestone. He came back with it and assaulted the window of a\r\nstore behind us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ground floor and no good,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained as he helped me through\r\nthe hole he had made; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s the best we can do. You get a nap and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll reconnoitre. I\xe2\x80\x99ll finish this rescue all right, but I want time,\r\ntime, lots of it\xe2\x80\x94and something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a harness store we found ourselves in, and he fixed me up a\r\ncouch of horse blankets in the private office well to the rear. To add\r\nto my wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on, and I was only\r\ntoo glad to close my eyes and try to sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be back,\xe2\x80\x9d were his parting words. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hope to get an auto,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll surely bring some grub,[1] anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1] Food.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the last I saw of Garthwaite for three years. Instead of\r\ncoming back, he was carried away to a hospital with a bullet through\r\nhis lungs and another through the fleshy part of his neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nNIGHTMARE\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not closed my eyes the night before on the Twentieth Century, and\r\nwhat of that and of my exhaustion I slept soundly. When I first awoke,\r\nit was night. Garthwaite had not returned. I had lost my watch and had\r\nno idea of the time. As I lay with my eyes closed, I heard the same\r\ndull sound of distant explosions. The inferno was still raging. I crept\r\nthrough the store to the front. The reflection from the sky of vast\r\nconflagrations made the street almost as light as day. One could have\r\nread the finest print with ease. From several blocks away came the\r\ncrackle of small hand-bombs and the churning of machine-guns, and from\r\na long way off came a long series of heavy explosions. I crept back to\r\nmy horse blankets and slept again.\r\n\r\nWhen next I awoke, a sickly yellow light was filtering in on me. It was\r\ndawn of the second day. I crept to the front of the store. A smoke\r\npall, shot through with lurid gleams, filled the sky. Down the opposite\r\nside of the street tottered a wretched slave. One hand he held tightly\r\nagainst his side, and behind him he left a bloody trail. His eyes roved\r\neverywhere, and they were filled with apprehension and dread. Once he\r\nlooked straight across at me, and in his face was all the dumb pathos\r\nof the wounded and hunted animal. He saw me, but there was no kinship\r\nbetween us, and with him, at least, no sympathy of understanding; for\r\nhe cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on. He could expect no aid\r\nin all God\xe2\x80\x99s world. He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the\r\nmasters were making. All he could hope for, all he sought, was some\r\nhole to crawl away in and hide like any animal. The sharp clang of a\r\npassing ambulance at the corner gave him a start. Ambulances were not\r\nfor such as he. With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway. A\r\nminute later he was out again and desperately hobbling on.\r\n\r\nI went back to my horse blankets and waited an hour for Garthwaite. My\r\nheadache had not gone away. On the contrary, it was increasing. It was\r\nby an effort of will only that I was able to open my eyes and look at\r\nobjects. And with the opening of my eyes and the looking came\r\nintolerable torment. Also, a great pulse was beating in my brain. Weak\r\nand reeling, I went out through the broken window and down the street,\r\nseeking to escape, instinctively and gropingly, from the awful\r\nshambles. And thereafter I lived nightmare. My memory of what happened\r\nin the succeeding hours is the memory one would have of nightmare. Many\r\nevents are focussed sharply on my brain, but between these indelible\r\npictures I retain are intervals of unconsciousness. What occurred in\r\nthose intervals I know not, and never shall know.\r\n\r\nI remember stumbling at the corner over the legs of a man. It was the\r\npoor hunted wretch that had dragged himself past my hiding-place. How\r\ndistinctly do I remember his poor, pitiful, gnarled hands as he lay\r\nthere on the pavement\xe2\x80\x94hands that were more hoof and claw than hands,\r\nall twisted and distorted by the toil of all his days, with on the\r\npalms a horny growth of callous a half inch thick. And as I picked\r\nmyself up and started on, I looked into the face of the thing and saw\r\nthat it still lived; for the eyes, dimly intelligent, were looking at\r\nme and seeing me.\r\n\r\nAfter that came a kindly blank. I knew nothing, saw nothing, merely\r\ntottered on in my quest for safety. My next nightmare vision was a\r\nquiet street of the dead. I came upon it abruptly, as a wanderer in the\r\ncountry would come upon a flowing stream. Only this stream I gazed upon\r\ndid not flow. It was congealed in death. From pavement to pavement, and\r\ncovering the sidewalks, it lay there, spread out quite evenly, with\r\nonly here and there a lump or mound of bodies to break the surface.\r\nPoor driven people of the abyss, hunted helots\xe2\x80\x94they lay there as the\r\nrabbits in California after a drive.[1] Up the street and down I\r\nlooked. There was no movement, no sound. The quiet buildings looked\r\ndown upon the scene from their many windows. And once, and once only, I\r\nsaw an arm that moved in that dead stream. I swear I saw it move, with\r\na strange writhing gesture of agony, and with it lifted a head, gory\r\nwith nameless horror, that gibbered at me and then lay down again and\r\nmoved no more.\r\n\r\n [1] In those days, so sparsely populated was the land that wild\r\n animals often became pests. In California the custom of rabbit-driving\r\n obtained. On a given day all the farmers in a locality would assemble\r\n and sweep across the country in converging lines, driving the rabbits\r\n by scores of thousands into a prepared enclosure, where they were\r\n clubbed to death by men and boys.\r\n\r\nI remember another street, with quiet buildings on either side, and the\r\npanic that smote me into consciousness as again I saw the people of the\r\nabyss, but this time in a stream that flowed and came on. And then I\r\nsaw there was nothing to fear. The stream moved slowly, while from it\r\narose groans and lamentations, cursings, babblings of senility,\r\nhysteria, and insanity; for these were the very young and the very old,\r\nthe feeble and the sick, the helpless and the hopeless, all the\r\nwreckage of the ghetto. The burning of the great ghetto on the South\r\nSide had driven them forth into the inferno of the street-fighting, and\r\nwhither they wended and whatever became of them I did not know and\r\nnever learned.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] It was long a question of debate, whether the burning of the South\r\n Side ghetto was accidental, or whether it was done by the Mercenaries;\r\n but it is definitely settled now that the ghetto was fired by the\r\n Mercenaries under orders from their chiefs.\r\n\r\nI have faint memories of breaking a window and hiding in some shop to\r\nescape a street mob that was pursued by soldiers. Also, a bomb burst\r\nnear me, once, in some still street, where, look as I would, up and\r\ndown, I could see no human being. But my next sharp recollection begins\r\nwith the crack of a rifle and an abrupt becoming aware that I am being\r\nfired at by a soldier in an automobile. The shot missed, and the next\r\nmoment I was screaming and motioning the signals. My memory of riding\r\nin the automobile is very hazy, though this ride, in turn, is broken by\r\none vivid picture. The crack of the rifle of the soldier sitting beside\r\nme made me open my eyes, and I saw George Milford, whom I had known in\r\nthe Pell Street days, sinking slowly down to the sidewalk. Even as he\r\nsank the soldier fired again, and Milford doubled in, then flung his\r\nbody out, and fell sprawling. The soldier chuckled, and the automobile\r\nsped on.\r\n\r\nThe next I knew after that I was awakened out of a sound sleep by a man\r\nwho walked up and down close beside me. His face was drawn and\r\nstrained, and the sweat rolled down his nose from his forehead. One\r\nhand was clutched tightly against his chest by the other hand, and\r\nblood dripped down upon the floor as he walked. He wore the uniform of\r\nthe Mercenaries. From without, as through thick walls, came the muffled\r\nroar of bursting bombs. I was in some building that was locked in\r\ncombat with some other building.\r\n\r\nA surgeon came in to dress the wounded soldier, and I learned that it\r\nwas two in the afternoon. My headache was no better, and the surgeon\r\npaused from his work long enough to give me a powerful drug that would\r\ndepress the heart and bring relief. I slept again, and the next I knew\r\nI was on top of the building. The immediate fighting had ceased, and I\r\nwas watching the balloon attack on the fortresses. Some one had an arm\r\naround me and I was leaning close against him. It came to me quite as a\r\nmatter of course that this was Ernest, and I found myself wondering how\r\nhe had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed.\r\n\r\nIt was by the merest chance that we had found each other in that\r\nterrible city. He had had no idea that I had left New York, and, coming\r\nthrough the room where I lay asleep, could not at first believe that it\r\nwas I. Little more I saw of the Chicago Commune. After watching the\r\nballoon attack, Ernest took me down into the heart of the building,\r\nwhere I slept the afternoon out and the night. The third day we spent\r\nin the building, and on the fourth, Ernest having got permission and an\r\nautomobile from the authorities, we left Chicago.\r\n\r\nMy headache was gone, but, body and soul, I was very tired. I lay back\r\nagainst Ernest in the automobile, and with apathetic eyes watched the\r\nsoldiers trying to get the machine out of the city. Fighting was still\r\ngoing on, but only in isolated localities. Here and there whole\r\ndistricts were still in possession of the comrades, but such districts\r\nwere surrounded and guarded by heavy bodies of troops. In a hundred\r\nsegregated traps were the comrades thus held while the work of\r\nsubjugating them went on. Subjugation meant death, for no quarter was\r\ngiven, and they fought heroically to the last man.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] Numbers of the buildings held out over a week, while one held out\r\n eleven days. Each building had to be stormed like a fort, and the\r\n Mercenaries fought their way upward floor by floor. It was deadly\r\n fighting. Quarter was neither given nor taken, and in the fighting the\r\n revolutionists had the advantage of being above. While the\r\n revolutionists were wiped out, the loss was not one-sided. The proud\r\n Chicago proletariat lived up to its ancient boast. For as many of\r\n itself as were killed, it killed that many of the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhenever we approached such localities, the guards turned us back and\r\nsent us around. Once, the only way past two strong positions of the\r\ncomrades was through a burnt section that lay between. From either side\r\nwe could hear the rattle and roar of war, while the automobile picked\r\nits way through smoking ruins and tottering walls. Often the streets\r\nwere blocked by mountains of debris that compelled us to go around. We\r\nwere in a labyrinth of ruin, and our progress was slow.\r\n\r\nThe stockyards (ghetto, plant, and everything) were smouldering ruins.\r\nFar off to the right a wide smoke haze dimmed the sky,\xe2\x80\x94the town of\r\nPullman, the soldier chauffeur told us, or what had been the town of\r\nPullman, for it was utterly destroyed. He had driven the machine out\r\nthere, with despatches, on the afternoon of the third day. Some of the\r\nheaviest fighting had occurred there, he said, many of the streets\r\nbeing rendered impassable by the heaps of the dead.\r\n\r\nSwinging around the shattered walls of a building, in the stockyards\r\ndistrict, the automobile was stopped by a wave of dead. It was for all\r\nthe world like a wave tossed up by the sea. It was patent to us what\r\nhad happened. As the mob charged past the corner, it had been swept, at\r\nright angles and point-blank range, by the machine-guns drawn up on the\r\ncross street. But disaster had come to the soldiers. A chance bomb must\r\nhave exploded among them, for the mob, checked until its dead and dying\r\nformed the wave, had white-capped and flung forward its foam of living,\r\nfighting slaves. Soldiers and slaves lay together, torn and mangled,\r\naround and over the wreckage of the automobiles and guns.\r\n\r\nErnest sprang out. A familiar pair of shoulders in a cotton shirt and a\r\nfamiliar fringe of white hair had caught his eye. I did not watch him,\r\nand it was not until he was back beside me and we were speeding on that\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Bishop Morehouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon we were in the green country, and I took one last glance back at\r\nthe smoke-filled sky. Faint and far came the low thud of an explosion.\r\nThen I turned my face against Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s breast and wept softly for the\r\nCause that was lost. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s arm about me was eloquent with love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this time lost, dear heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not forever. We have\r\nlearned. To-morrow the Cause will rise again, strong with wisdom and\r\ndiscipline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe automobile drew up at a railroad station. Here we would catch a\r\ntrain to New York. As we waited on the platform, three trains thundered\r\npast, bound west to Chicago. They were crowded with ragged, unskilled\r\nlaborers, people of the abyss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlave-levies for the rebuilding of Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\r\nthe Chicago slaves are all killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nTHE TERRORISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until Ernest and I were back in New York, and after weeks\r\nhad elapsed, that we were able to comprehend thoroughly the full sweep\r\nof the disaster that had befallen the Cause. The situation was bitter\r\nand bloody. In many places, scattered over the country, slave revolts\r\nand massacres had occurred. The roll of the martyrs increased mightily.\r\nCountless executions took place everywhere. The mountains and waste\r\nregions were filled with outlaws and refugees who were being hunted\r\ndown mercilessly. Our own refuges were packed with comrades who had\r\nprices on their heads. Through information furnished by its spies,\r\nscores of our refuges were raided by the soldiers of the Iron Heel.\r\n\r\nMany of the comrades were disheartened, and they retaliated with\r\nterroristic tactics. The set-back to their hopes made them despairing\r\nand desperate. Many terrorist organizations unaffiliated with us sprang\r\ninto existence and caused us much trouble.[1] These misguided people\r\nsacrificed their own lives wantonly, very often made our own plans go\r\nastray, and retarded our organization.\r\n\r\n [1] The annals of this short-lived era of despair make bloody reading.\r\n Revenge was the ruling motive, and the members of the terroristic\r\n organizations were careless of their own lives and hopeless about the\r\n future. The Danites, taking their name from the avenging angels of the\r\n Mormon mythology, sprang up in the mountains of the Great West and\r\n spread over the Pacific Coast from Panama to Alaska. The Valkyries\r\n were women. They were the most terrible of all. No woman was eligible\r\n for membership who had not lost near relatives at the hands of the\r\n Oligarchy. They were guilty of torturing their prisoners to death.\r\n Another famous organization of women was The Widows of War. A\r\n companion organization to the Valkyries was the Berserkers. These men\r\n placed no value whatever upon their own lives, and it was they who\r\n totally destroyed the great Mercenary city of Bellona along with its\r\n population of over a hundred thousand souls. The Bedlamites and the\r\n Helldamites were twin slave organizations, while a new religious sect\r\n that did not flourish long was called The Wrath of God. Among others,\r\n to show the whimsicality of their deadly seriousness, may be mentioned\r\n the following: The Bleeding Hearts, Sons of the Morning, the Morning\r\n Stars, The Flamingoes, The Triple Triangles, The Three Bars, The\r\n Rubonics, The Vindicators, The Comanches, and the Erebusites.\r\n\r\nAnd through it all moved the Iron Heel, impassive and deliberate,\r\nshaking up the whole fabric of the social structure in its search for\r\nthe comrades, combing out the Mercenaries, the labor castes, and all\r\nits secret services, punishing without mercy and without malice,\r\nsuffering in silence all retaliations that were made upon it, and\r\nfilling the gaps in its fighting line as fast as they appeared. And\r\nhand in hand with this, Ernest and the other leaders were hard at work\r\nreorganizing the forces of the Revolution. The magnitude of the task\r\nmay be understood when it is taken into.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] This is the end of the Everhard Manuscript. It breaks off abruptly\r\n in the middle of a sentence. She must have received warning of the\r\n coming of the Mercenaries, for she had time safely to hide the\r\n Manuscript before she fled or was captured. It is to be regretted that\r\n she did not live to complete her narrative, for then, undoubtedly,\r\n would have been cleared away the mystery that has shrouded for seven\r\n centuries the execution of Ernest Everhard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IRON HEEL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1164-0.txt or 1164-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/6/1164/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
