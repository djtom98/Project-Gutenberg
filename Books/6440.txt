WELBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school-room at Roselands was a very pleasant apartment; the\r\nceiling, it is true, was somewhat lower than in the more modern portion\r\nof the building, for the wing in which it was situated dated back to\r\nthe old-fashioned days prior to the Revolution, while the larger part\r\nof the mansion had not stood more than twenty or thirty years; but the\r\neffect was relieved by windows reaching from floor to ceiling, and\r\nopening on a veranda which overlooked a lovely flower-garden, beyond\r\nwhich were fields and woods and hills. The view from the veranda was\r\nvery beautiful, and the room itself looked most inviting, with its neat\r\nmatting, its windows draped with snow-white muslin, its comfortable\r\nchairs, and pretty rosewood desks.\r\n\r\nWithin this pleasant apartment sat Miss Day with her pupils, six in\r\nnumber. She was giving a lesson to Enna, the youngest, the spoiled\r\ndarling of the family, the pet and plaything of both father and mother.\r\nIt was always a trying task to both teacher and scholar, for Enna was\r\nvery wilful, and her teacher\'s patience by no means inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n"There!" exclaimed Miss Day, shutting the book and giving it an\r\nimpatient toss on to the desk; "go, for I might as well try to teach\r\nold Bruno. I presume he would learn about as fast."\r\n\r\nAnd Enna walked away with a pout on her pretty face, muttering that she\r\nwould "tell mamma."\r\n\r\n"Young ladies and gentlemen," said Miss Day, looking at her watch, "I\r\nshall leave you to your studies for an hour; at the end of which time I\r\nshall return to hear your recitations, when those who have attended\r\nproperly to their duties will be permitted to ride out with me to visit\r\nthe fair."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that will be jolly!" exclaimed Arthur, a bright-eyed,\r\nmischief-loving boy of ten.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Miss Day sternly; "let me hear no more such exclamations;\r\nand remember that you will not go unless your lessons are thoroughly\r\nlearned. Louise and Lora," addressing two young girls of the respective\r\nages of twelve and fourteen, "that French exercise must be perfect, and\r\nyour English lessons as well. Elsie," to a little girl of eight,\r\nsitting alone at a desk near one of the windows, and bending over a\r\nslate with an appearance of great industry, "every figure of that\r\nexample must be correct, your geography lesson recited perfectly, and a\r\npage in your copybook written without a blot."\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said the child meekly, raising a pair of large soft eyes\r\nof the darkest hazel for an instant to her teacher\'s face, and then\r\ndropping them again upon her slate.\r\n\r\n"And see that none of you leave the room until I return," continued the\r\ngoverness. "Walter, if you miss one word of that spelling, you will\r\nhave to stay at home and learn it over."\r\n\r\n"Unless mamma interferes, as she will be pretty sure to do," muttered\r\nArthur, as the door closed on Miss Day, and her retreating footsteps\r\nwere heard passing down the hall.\r\n\r\nFor about ten minutes after her departure, all was quiet in the\r\nschool-room, each seemingly completely absorbed in study. But at the\r\nend of that time Arthur sprang up, and flinging his book across the\r\nroom, exclaimed, "There! I know my lesson; and if I didn\'t, I shouldn\'t\r\nstudy another bit for old Day, or Night either."\r\n\r\n"Do be quiet, Arthur," said his sister Louise; "I can\'t study in such a\r\nracket."\r\n\r\nArthur stole on tiptoe across the room, and coming up behind Elsie,\r\ntickled the back of her neck with a feather.\r\n\r\nShe started, saying in a pleading tone, "Please, Arthur, don\'t."\r\n\r\n"It pleases me to do," he said, repeating the experiment.\r\n\r\nElsie changed her position, saying in the same gentle, persuasive tone,\r\n"O Arthur! _please_ let me alone, or I never shall be able to do this\r\nexample."\r\n\r\n"What! all this time on one example! you ought to be ashamed. Why, I\r\ncould have done it half a dozen times over."\r\n\r\n"I have been over and over it," replied the little girl in a tone of\r\ndespondency, "and still there are two figures that will not come right."\r\n\r\n"How do you know they are not right, little puss?" shaking her curls as\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n"Oh! please, Arthur, don\'t pull my hair. I have the answer--that\'s the\r\nway I know."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, why don\'t you just set the figures down. I would."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, indeed; that would not be honest."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! nonsense! nobody would be the wiser, nor the poorer."\r\n\r\n"No, but it would be just like telling a lie. But I can never get it\r\nright while you are bothering me so," said Elsie, laying her slate\r\naside in despair. Then taking out her geography, she began studying\r\nmost diligently. But Arthur continued his persecutions--tickling her,\r\npulling her hair, twitching the book out of her hand, and talking\r\nalmost incessantly, making remarks, and asking questions; till at last\r\nElsie said, as if just ready to cry, "Indeed, Arthur, if you don\'t let\r\nme alone, I shall never be able to get my lessons."\r\n\r\n"Go away then; take your book out on the veranda, and learn your\r\nlessons there," said Louise. "I\'ll call you when Miss Day comes."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, Louise, I cannot do that, because it would be disobedience,"\r\nreplied Elsie, taking out her writing materials.\r\n\r\nArthur stood over her criticising every letter she made, and finally\r\njogged her elbow in such a way as to cause her to drop all the ink in\r\nher pen upon the paper, making quite a large blot.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried the little girl, bursting into tears, "now I shall lose my\r\nride, for Miss Day will not let me go; and I was so anxious to see all\r\nthose beautiful flowers."\r\n\r\nArthur, who was really not very vicious, felt some compunction when he\r\nsaw the mischief he had done. "Never mind, Elsie," said he. "I can fix\r\nit yet. Just let me tear out this page, and you can begin again on the\r\nnext, and I\'ll not bother you. I\'ll make these two figures come right\r\ntoo," he added, taking up her slate.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Arthur," said the little girl, smiling through her tears;\r\n"you are very kind, but it would not be honest to do either, and I had\r\nrather stay at home than be deceitful."\r\n\r\n"Very well, miss," said he, tossing his head, and walking away, "since\r\nyou won\'t let me help you, it is all your own fault if you have to stay\r\nat home."\r\n\r\n"Elsie," exclaimed Louise, "I have no patience with you! such\r\nridiculous scruples as you are always raising. I shall not pity you one\r\nbit, if you are obliged to stay at home."\r\n\r\nElsie made no reply, but, brushing away a tear, bent over her writing,\r\ntaking great pains with every letter, though saying sadly to herself\r\nall the time, "It\'s of no use, for that great ugly blot will spoil it\r\nall."\r\n\r\nShe finished her page, and, excepting the unfortunate blot, it all\r\nlooked very neat indeed, showing plainly that it had been written with\r\ngreat care. She then took up her slate and patiently went over and over\r\nevery figure of the troublesome example, trying to discover where her\r\nmistake had been. But much time had been lost through Arthur\'s teasing,\r\nand her mind was so disturbed by the accident to her writing that she\r\ntried in vain to fix it upon the business in hand; and before the two\r\ntroublesome figures had been made right, the hour was past and Miss Day\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" thought Elsie, "if she will only hear the others first, I may be\r\nable to get this and the geography ready yet; and perhaps, if Arthur\r\nwill be generous enough to tell her about the blot, she may excuse me\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\nBut it was a vain hope. Miss Day had no sooner seated herself at her\r\ndesk, than she called, "Elsie, come here and say that lesson; and bring\r\nyour copybook and slate, that I may examine your work."\r\n\r\nElsie tremblingly obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe lesson, though a difficult one, was very tolerably recited; for\r\nElsie, knowing Arthur\'s propensity for teasing, had studied it in her\r\nown room before school hours. But Miss Day handed back the book with a\r\nfrown, saying, "I told you the recitation must be perfect, and it was\r\nnot."\r\n\r\nShe was always more severe with Elsie than with any other of her\r\npupils. The reason the reader will probably be able to divine ere long.\r\n\r\n"There are two incorrect figures in this example," said she, laying\r\ndown the slate, after glancing over its contents. Then taking up the\r\ncopy-book, she exclaimed, "Careless, disobedient child! did I not\r\ncaution you to be careful not to blot your book! There will be no ride\r\nfor you this morning. You have failed in everything. Go to your seat.\r\nMake that example right, and do the next; learn your geography lesson\r\nover, and write another page in your copy-book; and, mind, if there is\r\na blot on it, you will get no dinner."\r\n\r\nWeeping and sobbing, Elsie took up her books and obeyed.\r\n\r\nDuring this scene Arthur stood at his desk pretending to study, but\r\nglancing every now and then at Elsie, with a conscience evidently ill\r\nat ease. She cast an imploring glance at him, as she returned to her\r\nseat; but he turned away his head, muttering, "It\'s all her own fault,\r\nfor she wouldn\'t let me help her."\r\n\r\nAs he looked up again, he caught his sister Lora\'s eyes fixed on him\r\nwith an expression of scorn and contempt. He colored violently, and\r\ndropped his eyes upon his book.\r\n\r\n"Miss Day," said Lora, indignantly, "I see Arthur does not mean to\r\nspeak, and as I cannot bear to see such injustice, I must tell you that\r\nit is all his fault that Elsie has failed in her lessons; for she tried\r\nher very best, but he teased her incessantly, and also jogged her elbow\r\nand made her spill the ink on her book; and to her credit she was too\r\nhonorable to tear out the leaf from her copy-book, or to let him make\r\nher example right; both which he very generously proposed doing after\r\ncausing all the mischief."\r\n\r\n"Is this so, Arthur?" asked Miss Day, angrily.\r\n\r\nThe boy hung his head, but made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," said Miss Day, "you too must stay at home."\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Lora, in surprise, "you will not keep Elsie, since I\r\nhave shown you that she was not to blame."\r\n\r\n"Miss Lora," replied her teacher, haughtily, "I wish you to understand\r\nthat I am not to be dictated to by my pupils."\r\n\r\nLora bit her lip, but said nothing, and Miss Day went on hearing the\r\nlessons without further remark.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the little Elsie sat at her desk, striving to conquer\r\nthe feelings of anger and indignation that were swelling in her breast;\r\nfor Elsie, though she possessed much of "the ornament of a meek and\r\nquiet spirit," was not yet perfect, and often had a fierce contest with\r\nher naturally quick temper. Yet it was seldom, very seldom that word or\r\ntone or look betrayed the existence of such feelings; and it was a\r\ncommon remark in the family that Elsie had no spirit.\r\n\r\nThe recitations were scarcely finished when the door opened and a lady\r\nentered dressed for a ride.\r\n\r\n"Not through yet, Miss Day?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, madam, we are just done," replied the teacher, closing the French\r\ngrammar and handing it to Louise.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope your pupils have all done their duty this morning, and\r\nare ready to accompany us to the fair," said Mrs. Dinsmore. "But what\r\nis the matter with Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"She has failed in all her exercises, and therefore has been told that\r\nshe must remain at home," replied Miss Day with heightened color and in\r\na tone of anger; "and as Miss Lora tells me that Master Arthur was\r\npartly the cause, I have forbidden him also to accompany us."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Miss Day, for correcting you," said Lora, a little\r\nindignantly; "but I did not say _partly,_ for I am sure it was\r\n_entirely_ his fault."\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, Lora," said her mother, a little impatiently; "how can you\r\nbe sure of any such thing; Miss Day, I must beg of you to excuse Arthur\r\nthis once, for I have quite set my heart on taking him along. He is\r\nfond of mischief, I know, but he is only a child, and you must not be\r\ntoo hard upon him."\r\n\r\n"Very well, madam," replied the governess stiffly, "you have of course\r\nthe best right to control your own children."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore turned to leave the room.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," asked Lora, "is not Elsie to be allowed to go too?"\r\n\r\n"Elsie is not my child, and I have nothing to say about it. Miss Day,\r\nwho knows all the circumstances, is much better able than I to judge\r\nwhether or no she is deserving of punishment," replied Mrs. Dinsmore,\r\nsailing out of the room.\r\n\r\n"You will let her go, Miss Day?" said Lora, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lora," replied Miss Day, angrily, "I have already told you I was\r\nnot to be dictated to. I have said Elsie must remain at home, and I\r\nshall not break my word."\r\n\r\n"Such injustice!" muttered Lora, turning away.\r\n\r\n"Lora," said Louise, impatiently, "why need you concern yourself with\r\nElsie\'s affairs? for my part, I have no pity for her, so full as she is\r\nof nonsensical scruples."\r\n\r\nMiss Day crossed the room to where Elsie was sitting leaning her head\r\nupon the desk, struggling hard to keep down the feelings of anger and\r\nindignation aroused by the unjust treatment she had received.\r\n\r\n"Did I not order you to learn that lesson over?" said the governess,\r\n"and why are you sitting here idling?"\r\n\r\nElsie dared not speak lest her anger should show itself in words; so\r\nmerely raised her head, and hastily brushing away her tears, opened the\r\nbook. But Miss Day, who was irritated by Mrs. Dinsmore\'s interference,\r\nand also by the consciousness that she was acting unjustly, seemed\r\ndetermined to vent her displeasure upon her innocent victim.\r\n\r\n"Why do you not speak?" she exclaimed, seizing Elsie by the arm and\r\nshaking her violently. "Answer me this instant. Why have you been\r\nidling all the morning?"\r\n\r\n"I have _not_," replied the child hastily, stung to the quick by her\r\nunjust violence. "I have tried hard to do my duty, and you are\r\npunishing me when I don\'t deserve it at all."\r\n\r\n"How dare you? there! take that for your impertinence," said Miss Day,\r\ngiving her a box on the ear.\r\n\r\nElsie was about to make a still more angry reply; but she restrained\r\nherself, and turning to her book, tried to study, though the hot,\r\nblinding tears came so thick and fast that she could not see a letter.\r\n\r\n"De carriage am waiting, ladies, an\' missus in a hurry," said a\r\nservant, opening the door; and Miss Day hastily quitted the room,\r\nfollowed by Louise and Lora; and Elsie was left alone.\r\n\r\nShe laid down the geography, and opening her desk, took out a small\r\npocket Bible, which bore the marks of frequent use. She turned over the\r\nleaves as though seeking for some particular passage; at length she\r\nfound it, and wiping away the blinding tears, she read these words in a\r\nlow, murmuring tone:\r\n\r\n"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure\r\ngrief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it if, when ye be\r\nbuffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if when ye do\r\nwell, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with\r\nGod. For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for\r\nus, leaving us an example that ye should follow His steps."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I have not done it. I did not take it patiently. I am afraid I am\r\nnot following in His steps," she cried, bursting into an agony of tears\r\nand sobs.\r\n\r\n"My dear little girl, what is the matter?" asked a kind voice, and a\r\nsoft hand was gently laid on her shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe child looked up hastily. "O Miss Allison!" she said, "is it you? I\r\nthought I was quite alone."\r\n\r\n"And so you were, my dear, until this moment" replied the lady, drawing\r\nup a chair, and sitting down close beside her. "I was on the veranda,\r\nand hearing sobs, came in to see if I could be of any assistance. You\r\nlook very much distressed; will you not tell me the cause of your\r\nsorrow?"\r\n\r\nElsie answered only by a fresh burst of tears.\r\n\r\n"They have all gone to the fair and left you at home alone; perhaps to\r\nlearn a lesson you have failed in reciting?" said the lady, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said the child; "but that is not the worst;" and her\r\ntears fell faster, as she laid the little Bible on the desk, and\r\npointed with her finger to the words she had been reading. "Oh!" she\r\nsobbed, "I--I did not do it; I did not bear it patiently. I was treated\r\nunjustly, and punished when I was not to blame, and I grew angry. Oh!\r\nI\'m afraid I shall never be like Jesus! never, never."\r\n\r\nThe child\'s distress seemed very great, and Miss Allison was extremely\r\nsurprised. She was a visitor who had been in the house only a few days,\r\nand, herself a devoted Christian, had been greatly pained by the utter\r\ndisregard of the family in which she was sojourning for the teachings\r\nof God\'s word. Rose Allison was from the North, and Mr. Dinsmore, the\r\nproprietor of Roselands, was an old friend of her father, to whom he\r\nhad been paying a visit, and finding Rose in delicate health, he had\r\nprevailed upon her parents to allow her to spend the winter months with\r\nhis family in the more congenial clime of their Southern home.\r\n\r\n"My poor child," she said, passing her arm around the little one\'s\r\nwaist, "my poor little Elsie! that is your name, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am; Elsie Dinsmore," replied the little girl.\r\n\r\n"Well, Elsie, let me read you another verse from this blessed book.\r\nHere it is: \'The blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from _all_\r\nsin.\' And here again: \'If any man sin, we have an advocate with the\r\nFather Jesus Christ the righteous.\' Dear Elsie, \'if we confess our\r\nsins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said the child; "I have asked Him to forgive me, and I\r\nknow He has; but I am so sorry, oh! _so_ sorry that I have grieved and\r\ndispleased Him; for, O Miss Allison! I _do_ love Jesus, and want to be\r\nlike Him always."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear child, we must grieve for our sins when we remember that\r\nthey helped to slay the Lord. But I am very, very glad to learn that\r\nyou love Jesus, and are striving to do His will. I love Him too, and we\r\nwill love one another; for you know He says, \'By this shall men know\r\nthat ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another,\'" said Miss\r\nAllison, stroking the little girl\'s hair, and kissing her tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Will you love me? Oh! how glad I am," exclaimed the child joyfully; "I\r\nhave nobody to love me but poor old mammy."\r\n\r\n"And who is mammy?" asked the lady.\r\n\r\n"My dear old nurse, who has always taken care of me. Have you not seen\r\nher, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I may. I have seen a number of nice old colored women about\r\nhere since I came. But, Elsie, will you tell me who taught you about\r\nJesus, and how long you have loved Him?"\r\n\r\n"Ever since I can remember," replied the little girl earnestly; "and it\r\nwas dear old mammy who first told me how He suffered and died on the\r\ncross for us." Her eyes filled with tears and her voice quivered with\r\nemotion. "She used to talk to me about it just as soon as I could\r\nunderstand anything," she continued; "and then she would tell me that\r\nmy own dear mamma loved Jesus, and had gone to be with Him in heaven;\r\nand how, when she was dying, she put me--a little, wee baby, I was then\r\nnot quite a week old--into her arms, and said, \'Mammy, take my dear\r\nlittle baby and love her, and take care of her just as you did of me;\r\nand O mammy! be sure that you teach her to love God.\' Would you like to\r\nsee my mamma, Miss Allison?"\r\n\r\nAnd as she spoke she drew from her bosom a miniature set in gold and\r\ndiamonds, which she wore suspended by a gold chain around her neck, and\r\nput it in Rose\'s hand.\r\n\r\nIt was the likeness of a young and blooming girl, not more than fifteen\r\nor sixteen years of age. She was very beautiful, with a sweet, gentle,\r\nwinning countenance, the same soft hazel eyes and golden brown curls\r\nthat the little Elsie possessed; the same regular features, pure\r\ncomplexion, and sweet smile.\r\n\r\nMiss Allison gazed at it a moment in silent admiration; then turning\r\nfrom it to the child with a puzzled expression, she said, "But, Elsie,\r\nI do not understand; are you not sister to Enna and the rest, and is\r\nnot Mrs. Dinsmore own mother to them all?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, to all of them, but not to me nor my papa. Their brother\r\nHorace is my papa, and so they are all my aunts and uncles."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said the lady, musingly; "I thought you looked very unlike\r\nthe rest. And your papa is away, is he not, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am; he is in Europe. He has been away almost ever since I was\r\nborn, and I have never seen him. Oh! how I do wish he would come home!\r\nhow I long to see him! Do you think he would love me, Miss Allison? Do\r\nyou think he would take me on his knee and pet me, as grandpa does\r\nEnna?"\r\n\r\n"I should think he would, dear; I don\'t know how he could help loving\r\nhis own dear little girl," said the lady, again kissing the little rosy\r\ncheek. "But now," she added, rising, "I must go away and let you learn\r\nyour lesson."\r\n\r\nThen taking up the little Bible, and turning over the leaves, she\r\nasked, "Would you like to come to my room sometimes in the mornings and\r\nevenings, and read this book with me, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, ma\'am, dearly!" exclaimed the child, her eyes sparkling with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"Come then this evening, if you like; and now goodbye for the present."\r\nAnd pressing another kiss on the child\'s cheek, she left her and went\r\nback to her own room, where she found her friend Adelaide Dinsmore, a\r\nyoung lady near her own age, and the eldest daughter of the family.\r\nAdelaide was seated on a sofa, busily employed with some fancy work.\r\n\r\n"You see I am making myself quite at home," she said, looking up as\r\nRose entered. "I cannot imagine where you have been all this time."\r\n\r\n"Can you not? In the school-room, talking with little Elsie. Do you\r\nknow, Adelaide, I thought she was your sister; but she tells me not."\r\n\r\n"No, she is Horace\'s child. I supposed you knew; but if you do not, I\r\nmay just as well tell you the whole story. Horace was a very wild boy,\r\npetted and spoiled, and always used to having his own way; and when he\r\nwas about seventeen--quite a forward youth he was too--he must needs go\r\nto New Orleans to spend some months with a schoolmate; and there he\r\nmet, and fell desperately in love with, a very beautiful girl a year or\r\ntwo younger than himself, an orphan and very wealthy. Fearing that\r\nobjections would be made on the score of their youth, etc., etc., he\r\npersuaded her to consent to a private marriage, and they had been man\r\nand wife for some months before either her friends or his suspected it.\r\n\r\n"Well, when it came at last to papa\'s ears, he was very angry, both on\r\naccount of their extreme youth, and because, as Elsie Grayson\'s father\r\nhad made all his money by trade, he did not consider her quite my\r\nbrother\'s equal; so he called Horace home and sent him North to\r\ncollege. Then he studied law, and since that he has been traveling in\r\nforeign lands. But to return to his wife; it seems that her guardian\r\nwas quite as much opposed to the match as papa; and the poor girl was\r\nmade to believe that she should never see her husband again. All their\r\nletters were intercepted, and finally she was told that he was dead;\r\nso, as Aunt Chloe says, \'she grew thin and pale, and weak and\r\nmelancholy,\' and while the little Elsie was yet not quite a week old,\r\nshe died. We never saw her; she died in her guardian\'s house, and there\r\nthe little Elsie stayed in charge of Aunt Chloe, who was an old servant\r\nin the family, and had nursed her mother before her, and of the\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Murray, a pious old Scotch woman, until about four\r\nyears ago, when her guardian\'s death broke up the family, and then they\r\ncame to us. Horace never comes home, and does not seem to care for his\r\nchild, for he never mentions her in his letters, except when it is\r\nnecessary in the way of business."\r\n\r\n"She is a dear little thing," said Rose. "I am sure he could not help\r\nloving her, if he could only see her."\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, she is well enough, and I often feel sorry for the lonely\r\nlittle thing, but the truth is, I believe we are a little jealous of\r\nher; she is so extremely beautiful, and heiress to such an immense\r\nfortune. Mamma often frets, and says that one of these days she will\r\nquite eclipse her younger daughters."\r\n\r\n"But then," said Rose, "she is almost as near; her own grand-daughter."\r\n\r\n"No, she is not so very near," replied Adelaide, "for Horace is not\r\nmamma\'s son. He was seven or eight years old when she married papa, and\r\nI think she was never particularly fond of him."\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes," thought Rose, "that explains it. Poor little Elsie! No\r\nwonder you pine for your father\'s love, and grieve over the loss of the\r\nmother you never knew!"\r\n\r\n"She is an odd child," said Adelaide; "I don\'t understand her; she is\r\nso meek and patient she will fairly let you trample upon her. It\r\nprovokes papa. He says she is no Dinsmore, or she would know how to\r\nstand up for her own rights; and yet she has a temper, I know, for once\r\nin a great while it shows itself for an instant--only an instant,\r\nthough, and at very long intervals--and then she grieves over it for\r\ndays, as though she had committed some great crime; while the rest of\r\nus think nothing of getting angry half a dozen times in a day. And then\r\nshe is forever poring over that little Bible of hers; what she sees so\r\nattractive in it I\'m sure I cannot tell, for I must say I find it the\r\ndullest of dull books."\r\n\r\n"Do you," said Rose; "how strange! I had rather give up all other books\r\nthan that one. \'Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever, for\r\nthey are the rejoicing of my heart,\' \'How sweet are thy words unto my\r\ntaste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.\'"\r\n\r\n"Do you _really_ love it so, Rose?" asked Adelaide, lifting her eyes to\r\nher friend\'s face with an expression of astonishment; "do tell me why?"\r\n\r\n"For its exceeding great and precious promises Adelaide; for its holy\r\nteachings; for its offers of peace and pardon and eternal life. I am a\r\nsinner, Adelaide, lost, ruined, helpless, hopeless, and the Bible\r\nbrings me the glad news of salvation offered as a free, unmerited gift;\r\nit tells me that Jesus died to save sinners--just such sinners as I. I\r\nfind that I have a heart deceitful above all things and desperately\r\nwicked, and the blessed Bible tells me how that heart can be renewed,\r\nand where I can obtain that holiness without which no man shall see the\r\nLord. I find myself utterly unable to keep God\'s holy law, and it tells\r\nme of One who has kept it for me. I find that I deserve the wrath and\r\ncurse of a justly offended God, and it tells me of Him who was made a\r\ncurse for me. I find that all my righteousnesses are as filthy rags,\r\nand it offers me the beautiful, spotless robe of Christ\'s perfect\r\nrighteousness. Yes, it tells me that God can be just, and the justifier\r\nof him who believes in Jesus."\r\n\r\nRose spoke these words with deep emotion, then suddenly clasping her\r\nhands and raising her eyes, she exclaimed, "\'Thanks be unto God for His\r\nunspeakable gift!\'"\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was silence. Then Adelaide spoke:\r\n\r\n"Rose," said she, "you talk as if you were a great sinner; but I don\'t\r\nbelieve it; it is only your humility that makes you think so. Why, what\r\nhave you ever done? Had you been a thief, a murderer, or guilty of any\r\nother great crime, I could see the propriety of your using such\r\nlanguage with regard to yourself; but for a refined, intelligent,\r\namiable young lady, excuse me for saying it, dear Rose, but such\r\nlanguage seems to me simply absurd."\r\n\r\n"Man looketh upon the outward appearance, but the Lord pondereth the\r\nheart," said Rose, gently. "No, dear Adelaide, you are mistaken; for I\r\ncan truly say \'mine iniquities have gone over my head as a cloud, and\r\nmy transgressions as a thick cloud.\' Every duty has been stained with\r\nsin, every motive impure, every thought unholy. From my earliest\r\nexistence, God has required the undivided love of my whole heart, soul,\r\nstrength, and mind; and so far from yielding it, I live at enmity with\r\nHim, and rebellion against His government, until within the last two\r\nyears. For seventeen years He has showered blessings upon me, giving me\r\nlife, health, strength, friends, and all that was necessary for\r\nhappiness; and for fifteen of those years I returned Him nothing but\r\ningratitude and rebellion. For fifteen years I rejected His offers of\r\npardon and reconciliation, turned my back upon the Saviour of sinners,\r\nand resisted all the strivings of God\'s Holy Spirit, and will you say\r\nthat I am not a great sinner?" Her voice quivered, and her eyes were\r\nfull of tears.\r\n\r\n"Dear Rose," said Adelaide, putting her arm around her friend and\r\nkissing her cheek affectionately, "don\'t think of these things;\r\nreligion is too gloomy for one so young as you."\r\n\r\n"Gloomy, dear Adelaide!" replied Rose, returning the embrace; "I never\r\nknew what true happiness was until I found Jesus. My sins often make me\r\nsad, but religion, never.\r\n\r\n   "\'Oft I walk beneath the cloud,\r\n    Dark as midnight\'s gloomy shroud;\r\n    But when fear is at the height,\r\n    Jesus comes, and all is light.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Thy injuries would teach patience to blaspheme,\r\n    Yet still thou art a dove."\r\n                             --BEAUMONT\'S _Double Marriage._\r\n\r\n\r\n   "When forced to part from those we love,\r\n      Though sure to meet to-morrow;\r\n    We yet a kind of anguish prove\r\n      And feel a touch of sorrow.\r\n    But oh! what words can paint the fears\r\n      When from these friends we sever,\r\n    Perhaps to part for months--for years--\r\n      Perhaps to part forever."\r\n                                 --ANON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Allison had gone, and Elsie found herself once more quite\r\nalone, she rose from her chair, and kneeling down with the open Bible\r\nbefore her, she poured out her story of sins and sorrows, in simple,\r\nchild-like words, into the ears of the dear Saviour whom she loved so\r\nwell; confessing that when she had done well and suffered for it, she\r\nhad not taken it patiently, and earnestly pleading that she might be\r\nmade like unto the meek and lowly Jesus. Low sobs burst from her\r\nburdened heart, and the tears of penitence fell upon the pages of the\r\nholy book. But when she rose from her knees, her load of sin and sorrow\r\nwas all gone, and her heart made light and happy with a sweet sense of\r\npeace and pardon. Once again, as often before, the little Elsie was\r\nmade to experience the blessedness of "the man whose transgression is\r\nforgiven, whose sin is covered."\r\n\r\nShe now set to work diligently at her studies, and ere the party\r\nreturned was quite prepared to meet Miss Day, having attended\r\nfaithfully to all she had required of her. The lesson was recited\r\nwithout the smallest mistake, every figure of the examples worked out\r\ncorrectly, and the page of the copy-book neatly and carefully written.\r\n\r\nMiss Day had been in a very captious mood all day, and seemed really\r\nprovoked that Elsie had not given her the smallest excuse for\r\nfault-finding. Handing the book back to her, she said, very coldly, "I\r\nsee you can do your duties well enough when you choose."\r\n\r\nElsie felt keenly the injustice of the remark, and longed to say that\r\nshe had tried quite as earnestly in the morning; but she resolutely\r\ncrushed down the indignant feeling, and calling to mind the rash words\r\nthat had cost her so many repentant tears, she replied meekly, "I am\r\nsorry I did not succeed better this morning, Miss Day, though I did\r\nreally try; and I am still more sorry for the saucy answer I gave you;\r\nand I ask your pardon for it."\r\n\r\n"You _ought_ to be sorry," replied Miss Day, severely, "and I hope you\r\nare; for it was a very impertinent speech indeed, and deserving of a\r\nmuch more severe punishment than you received. Now go, and never let me\r\nhear anything of the kind from you again."\r\n\r\nPoor little Elsie\'s eyes filled with tears at these ungracious words,\r\naccompanied by a still more ungracious manner; but she turned away\r\nwithout a word, and placing her books and slate carefully in her desk,\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nRose Allison was sitting alone in her room that evening, thinking of\r\nher far-distant home, when hearing a gentle rap at her door, she rose\r\nand opened it to find Elsie standing there with her little Bible in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Come in, darling," she said, stooping to give the little one a kiss;\r\n"I am very glad to see you."\r\n\r\n"I may stay with you for half an hour, Miss Allison, if you like," said\r\nthe child, seating herself on the low ottoman pointed out by Rose, "and\r\nthen mammy is coming to put me to bed."\r\n\r\n"It will be a very pleasant half-hour to both of us, I hope," replied\r\nRose, opening her Bible.\r\n\r\nThey read a chapter together--Rose now and then pausing to make a few\r\nexplanations--and then kneeling down, she offered up a prayer for the\r\nteachings of the Spirit, and for God\'s blessing on themselves and all\r\ntheir dear ones.\r\n\r\n"Dear little Elsie," she said, folding the child in her arms, when they\r\nhad risen from their knees, "how I love you already, and how very glad\r\nI am to find that there is one in this house beside myself who loves\r\nJesus, and loves to study His word, and to call upon His name."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Miss Allison; and there is _more_ than one, for mammy loves\r\nHim, too, very dearly," replied the little girl, earnestly.\r\n\r\n"Does she, darling? Then I must love her, too, for I cannot help loving\r\nall who love my Saviour."\r\n\r\nThen Rose sat down, and drawing the little girl to a seat on her knee,\r\nthey talked sweetly together of the race they were running, and the\r\nprize they hoped to obtain at the end of it; of the battle they were\r\nfighting, and the invisible foes with whom they were called to\r\nstruggle--the armor that had been provided, and of Him who had promised\r\nto be the Captain of their salvation, and to bring them off more than\r\nconquerors. They were pilgrims in the same straight and narrow way, and\r\nit was very pleasant thus to walk a little while together. "Then they\r\nthat feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened\r\nand heard it; and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them\r\nthat feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name. And they shall be\r\nmine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels;\r\nand I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him."\r\n\r\n"That is mammy coming for me," said Elsie, as a low knock was heard at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Rose, and the door opened, and a very nice colored\r\nwoman of middle age, looking beautifully neat in her snow-white apron\r\nand turban, entered with a low courtesy, asking, "Is my little missus\r\nready for bed now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Elsie, jumping off Rose\'s lap; "but come here, mammy; I\r\nwant to introduce you to Miss Allison."\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Aunt Chloe? I am very glad to know you, since Elsie\r\ntells me you are a servant of the same blessed Master whom I love and\r\ntry to serve," said Rose, putting her small white hand cordially into\r\nChloe\'s dusky one.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed I hope I is, missus," replied Chloe, pressing it fervently in\r\nboth of hers. "I\'s only a poor old black sinner, but de good Lord\r\nJesus, He loves me jes de same as if I was white, an\' I love Him an\'\r\nall His chillen with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Aunt Chloe," said Rose, "He is our peace, and hath made both one,\r\nand hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; so that\r\nwe are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the\r\nsaints and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation\r\nof the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief\r\ncorner-stone."\r\n\r\n"Yes, missus, dat\'s it for sure; ole Chloe knows dat\'s in de Bible; an\'\r\nif we be built on dat bressed corner-stone, we\'s safe ebery one; I\'se\r\nheard it many\'s de time, an\' it fills dis ole heart with joy an\' peace\r\nin believing," she exclaimed, raising her tearful eyes and clasping her\r\nhands. "But good night, missus; I must put my chile to bed," she added,\r\ntaking Elsie\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Aunt Chloe; come in again," said Rose. "And good-night to\r\nyou, too, dear little Elsie," folding the little girl again in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t dat a bressed young lady, darlin\'!" exclaimed Chloe, earnestly,\r\nas she began the business of preparing her young charge for bed.\r\n\r\n"O mammy, I love her so much! she\'s so good and kind," replied the\r\nchild, "and she loves Jesus, and loves to talk about Him."\r\n\r\n"She reminds me of your dear mamma, Miss Elsie, but she\'s not so\r\nhandsome," replied the nurse, with a tear in her eye; "ole Chloe tinks\r\ndere\'s nebber any lady so beautiful as her dear young missus was."\r\n\r\nElsie drew out the miniature and kissed it, murmuring, "Dear, darling\r\nmamma," then put it back in her bosom again, for she always wore it day\r\nand night. She was standing in her white night-dress, the tiny white\r\nfeet just peeping from under it, while Chloe brushed back her curls and\r\nput on her night-cap.\r\n\r\n"Dere now, darlin\', you\'s ready for bed," she exclaimed, giving the\r\nchild a hug and a kiss.\r\n\r\n"No, mammy, not quite," replied the little girl, and gliding away to\r\nthe side of the bed, she knelt down and offered up her evening prayer.\r\nThen, coming back to the toilet table, she opened her little Bible,\r\nsaying, "Now, mammy, I will read you a chapter while you are getting\r\nready for bed."\r\n\r\nThe room was large and airy, and Aunt Chloe, who was never willing to\r\nleave her nursling, but watched over her night and day with the most\r\ndevoted affection, slept in a cot bed in one corner.\r\n\r\n"Tank you, my dear young missus, you\'s berry good," she said, beginning\r\nthe preparations for the night by taking off her turban and replacing\r\nit by a thick night-cap.\r\n\r\nWhen the chapter was finished Elsie got into bed, saying, "Now, mammy,\r\nyou may put out the light as soon as you please; and be sure to call me\r\nearly in the morning, for I have a lesson to learn before breakfast."\r\n\r\n"That I will, darlin\'," replied the old woman, spreading the cover\r\ncarefully over her. "Good-night, my pet, your ole mammy hopes her chile\r\nwill have pleasant dreams."\r\n\r\nRose Allison was an early riser, and as the breakfast hour at Roselands\r\nwas eight o\'clock, she always had an hour or two for reading before it\r\nwas time to join the family circle. She had asked Elsie to come to her\r\nat half-past seven, and punctually at the hour the little girl\'s gentle\r\nrap was heard at her door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Rose, and Elsie entered, looking as bright and fresh\r\nand rosy as the morning. She had her little Bible under her arm, and a\r\nbouquet of fresh flowers in her hand. "Good-morning, dear Miss\r\nAllison," she said, dropping a graceful courtesy as she presented it.\r\n"I have come to read, and I have just been out to gather these for you,\r\nbecause I know you love flowers."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, darling, they are very lovely," said Rose, accepting the\r\ngift and bestowing a caress upon the giver. "You are quite punctual,"\r\nshe added, "and now we can have our half-hour together before\r\nbreakfast."\r\n\r\nThe time was spent profitably and pleasantly, and passed so quickly\r\nthat both were surprised when the breakfast bell rang.\r\n\r\nMiss Allison spent the whole fall and winter at Roselands; and it was\r\nvery seldom during all that time that she and Elsie failed to have\r\ntheir morning and evening reading and prayer together. Rose was often\r\nmade to wonder at the depth of the little girl\'s piety and the\r\nknowledge of divine things she possessed. But Elsie had had the best of\r\nteaching. Chloe, though entirely uneducated, was a simple-minded,\r\nearnest Christian, and with a heart full of love to Jesus, had, as we\r\nhave seen, early endeavored to lead the little one to Him, and Mrs.\r\nMurray--the housekeeper whom Adelaide had mentioned, and who had\r\nassisted Chloe in the care of the child from the time of her birth\r\nuntil a few months before Rose\'s coming, when she had suddenly been\r\nsummoned home to Scotland--had proved a very faithful friend. She was\r\nan intelligent woman and devotedly pious, and had carefully instructed\r\nthis lonely little one, for whom she felt almost a parent\'s affection,\r\nand her efforts to bring her to a saving knowledge of Christ had been\r\nsignally owned and blessed of God; and in answer to her earnest\r\nprayers, the Holy Spirit had vouchsafed His teachings, without which\r\nall human instruction must ever be in vain. And young as Elsie was, she\r\nhad already a very lovely and well-developed Christian character.\r\nThough not a remarkably precocious child in other respects, she seemed\r\nto have very clear and correct views on almost every subject connected\r\nwith her duty to God and her neighbor; was very truthful both in word\r\nand deed, very strict in her observance of the Sabbath--though the rest\r\nof the family were by no means particular in that respect--very\r\ndiligent in her studies, respectful to superiors, and kind to inferiors\r\nand equals; and she was gentle, sweet-tempered, patient, and forgiving\r\nto a remarkable degree. Rose became strongly attached to her, and the\r\nlittle girl fully returned her affection.\r\n\r\nElsie was very sensitive and affectionate, and felt keenly the want of\r\nsympathy and love, for which, at the time of Rose\'s coming, she had no\r\none to look to but poor old Chloe, who loved her with all her heart.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Adelaide sometimes treated her almost affectionately, and\r\nLora, who had a very strong sense of justice, occasionally interfered\r\nand took her part when she was very unjustly accused, but no one seemed\r\nreally to care for her, and she often felt sad and lonely. Mr.\r\nDinsmore, though her own grandfather, treated her with entire neglect,\r\nseemed to have not the slightest affection for her, and usually spoke\r\nof her as "old Crayson\'s grandchild." Mrs. Dinsmore really disliked\r\nher, because she looked upon her as the child of a stepson for whom she\r\nhad never felt any affection, and also as the future rival of her own\r\nchildren; while the governess and the younger members of the family,\r\nfollowing the example of their elders, treated her with neglect, and\r\noccasionally even with abuse. Miss Day, knowing that she was in no\r\ndanger of incurring the displeasure of her superiors by so doing,\r\nvented upon her all the spite she dared not show to her other pupils;\r\nand continually she was made to give up her toys and pleasures to Enna,\r\nand even sometimes to Arthur and Walter. It often cost her a struggle,\r\nand had she possessed less of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,\r\nher life had been wretched indeed.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all her trials and vexations, little Elsie was the\r\nhappiest person in the family; for she had in her heart that peace\r\nwhich the world can neither give nor take away; that joy which the\r\nSaviour gives to His own, and no man taketh from them. She constantly\r\ncarried all her sorrows and troubles to Him, and the coldness and\r\nneglect of others seemed but to drive her nearer to that Heavenly\r\nFriend, until she felt that while possessed of His love, she could not\r\nbe unhappy, though treated with scorn and abuse by all the world.\r\n\r\n   "The good are better made by ill,\r\n    As odors crushed are sweeter still;"\r\n\r\nAnd even so it seemed to be with little Elsie; her trials seemed to\r\nhave only the effect of purifying and making more lovely her naturally\r\namiable character.\r\n\r\nElsie talked much and thought more of her absent and unknown father,\r\nand longed with an intensity of desire for his return home. It was her\r\ndream, by day and by night, that he had come, that he had taken her to\r\nhis heart, calling her "his own darling child, his precious little\r\nElsie;" for such were the loving epithets she often heard lavished upon\r\nEnna, and which she longed to hear addressed to herself. But from month\r\nto month, and year to year, that longed-for return had been delayed\r\nuntil the little heart had grown sick with hope deferred, and was often\r\nweary with its almost hopeless waiting. But to return.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said Adelaide, as Miss Allison and the little girl entered the\r\nbreakfast-room on the morning after Elsie\'s disappointment, "the fair\r\nis not over yet, and Miss Allison and I are going to ride out there\r\nthis afternoon; so, if you are a good girl in school, you may go with\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Oh! thank you, dear Aunt Adelaide," exclaimed the little girl,\r\nclapping her hands with delight; "how kind you are! and I shall be so\r\nglad."\r\n\r\nMiss Day frowned, and looked as if she wanted to reprove her for her\r\nnoisy demonstrations of delight, but, standing somewhat in awe of\r\nAdelaide, said nothing.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie suddenly relapsed into silence, for at that moment Mrs.\r\nDinsmore entered the room, and it was seldom that she could utter a\r\nword in her presence without being reproved and told that "children\r\nshould be seen and not heard," though her own were allowed to talk as\r\nmuch as they pleased.\r\n\r\nMiss Day seemed cross, Mrs. Dinsmore was moody and taciturn,\r\ncomplaining of headache, and Mr. Dinsmore occupied with the morning\r\npaper; and so the meal passed off in almost unbroken silence. Elsie was\r\nglad when it was over, and hastening to the school-room, she began her\r\ntasks without waiting for the arrival of the regular hour for study.\r\n\r\nShe had the room entirely to herself, and had been busily engaged for\r\nhalf an hour in working out her examples, when the opening of the door\r\ncaused her to look up, and, to her dismay, Arthur entered. He did not,\r\nhowever, as she feared, begin his customary course of teasing and\r\ntormenting, but seated himself at his desk, leaning his head upon his\r\nhand in an attitude of dejection.\r\n\r\nElsie wondered what ailed him, his conduct was so unusual, and she\r\ncould not help every now and then sending an inquiring glance toward\r\nhim, and at length she asked, "What is the matter, Arthur?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing much," said he, gruffly, turning his back to her.\r\n\r\nThus repulsed, she said no more, but gave her undivided attention to\r\nher employment; and so diligent was she, that Miss Day had no excuse\r\nwhatever for fault-finding this morning. Her tasks were all completed\r\nwithin the required time, and she enjoyed her promised ride with her\r\naunt and Miss Allison, and her visit to the fair, very much indeed.\r\n\r\nIt was still early when they returned; and finding that she had nearly\r\nan hour to dispose of before tea-time, Elsie thought she would finish a\r\ndrawing which she had left in her desk in the school-room. While\r\nsearching for it and her pencil, she heard Lora\'s and Arthur\'s voices\r\non the veranda.\r\n\r\nShe did not notice what they were saying, until her own name struck her\r\near.\r\n\r\n"Elsie is the only person," Lora was saying, "who can, and probably\r\nwill, help you; for she has plenty of money, and she is so kind and\r\ngenerous; but, if I were you, I should be ashamed to ask her, after the\r\nway you acted toward her."\r\n\r\n"I wish I hadn\'t teased her so yesterday," replied Arthur,\r\ndisconsolately, "but it\'s such fun, I can\'t help it sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Well, I know I wouldn\'t ask a favor of anybody I had treated so," said\r\nLora, walking away.\r\n\r\nElsie sat still a few moments, working at her drawing and wondering all\r\nthe time what it was Arthur wanted, and thinking how glad she would be\r\nof an opportunity of returning him good for evil. She did not like,\r\nthough, to seek his confidence, but presently hearing him heave a deep\r\nsigh, she rose and went out on the veranda.\r\n\r\nHe was leaning on the railing in an attitude of dejection, his head\r\nbent down and his eyes fixed on the floor. She went up to him, and\r\nlaying her hand softly on his shoulder, said, in the sweet, gentle\r\ntones natural to her. "What ails you, Arthur? Can I do anything for\r\nyou? I will be very glad if I can."\r\n\r\n"No--yes--" he answered hesitatingly; "I wouldn\'t like to ask you\r\nafter--after--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! never mind," said Elsie, quickly; "I do not care anything about\r\nthat now. I had the ride to-day, and that was better still, because I\r\nwent with Aunt Adelaide and Miss Allison. Tell me what you want."\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Arthur replied, "I saw a beautiful little ship\r\nyesterday when I was in the city; it was only five dollars, and I\'ve\r\nset my heart on having it, but my pocket money\'s all gone, and papa\r\nwon\'t give me a cent until next month\'s allowance is due; and by that\r\ntime the ship will be gone, for it\'s such a beauty somebody\'ll be sure\r\nto buy it."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t your mamma buy it for you?" asked Elsie.\r\n\r\n"No, she says she hasn\'t the money to spare just now. You know it\'s\r\nnear the end of the month, and they\'ve all spent their allowances\r\nexcept Louise, and she says she\'ll not lend her money to such a\r\nspendthrift as I am."\r\n\r\nElsie drew out her purse, and seemed just about to put it into his\r\nhand; but, apparently changing her mind, she hesitated a moment, and\r\nthen returning it to her pocket, said, with a half smile, "I don\'t\r\nknow, Arthur; five dollars is a good deal for a little girl like me to\r\nlay out at once. I must think about it a little."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask you to _give_ it," he replied scornfully; "I\'ll pay it\r\nback in two weeks."\r\n\r\n"Well, I will see by to-morrow morning," she said, darting away, while\r\nhe sent an angry glance after her, muttering the word "stingy" between\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\nElsie ran down to the kitchen, asking of one and another of the\r\nservants as she passed, "Where\'s Pompey?" The last time she put the\r\nquestion to Phoebe, the cook, but was answered by Pompey himself. "Here\r\nam Pomp, Miss Elsie; what does little missy want wid dis chile?"\r\n\r\n"Are you going to the city to-night, Pompey?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Elsie, I\'se got some arrants to do for missus an\' de family\r\nin ginral, an\' I ben gwine start in \'bout ten minutes. Little missy\r\nwants sumpin\', eh?"\r\n\r\nElsie motioned to him to come close to her, and then putting her purse\r\ninto his hands, she told him in a whisper of Arthur\'s wish, and\r\ndirected him to purchase the coveted toy, and bring it to her, if\r\npossible, without letting any one else know anything about it. "And\r\nkeep half a dollar for yourself, Pompey, to pay you for your trouble,"\r\nshe added in conclusion.\r\n\r\n"Tank you, little missy," he replied, with a broad grin of\r\nsatisfaction; "dat be berry good pay, and Pomp am de man to do dis\r\nbusiness up for you \'bout right."\r\n\r\nThe tea-bell rang, and Elsie hastened away to answer the summons. She\r\nlooked across the table at Arthur with a pleasant smile on her\r\ncountenance, but he averted his eyes with an angry scowl; and with a\r\nslight sigh she turned away her head, and did not look at him again\r\nduring the meal.\r\n\r\nPompey executed his commission faithfully; and when Elsie returned to\r\nher own room after her evening hour with Miss Rose, Chloe pointed out\r\nthe little ship standing on the mantel.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s a little beauty," cried Elsie, clapping her hands and dancing\r\nup and down with delight; "how Arthur will be pleased! Now, mammy, can\r\nyou take it to the school-room, and put it on Master Arthur\'s desk,\r\nwithout anybody seeing you?"\r\n\r\n"Ole Chloe\'ll try, darlin," she said, taking it in her hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh! wait one moment," exclaimed Elsie, and taking a card, she wrote on\r\nit, "A present to Arthur, from his niece Elsie." Then laying it on the\r\ndeck of the little vessel. "There, mammy," she said, "I think that will\r\ndo; but please look out first to see whether any one is in the hall."\r\n\r\n"Coast all clear, darlin\'," replied Chloe, after a careful survey; "all\r\nde chillens am in bed before dis time, I spec." And taking a candle in\r\none hand and the little ship in the other, she started for the\r\nschool-room. She soon returned with a broad grin of satisfaction on her\r\nblack face, saying, "All right, darlin\', I put him on Massa Arthur\'s\r\ndesk, an\' nobody de wiser."\r\n\r\nSo Elsie went to bed very happy in the thought of the pleasure Arthur\r\nwould have in receiving her present.\r\n\r\nShe was hurrying down to the breakfast-room the next morning, a little\r\nin advance of Miss Rose, who had stopped to speak to Adelaide, when\r\nArthur came running up behind her, having just come in by a side door\r\nfrom the garden, and seizing her round the waist, he said, "Thank you,\r\nElsie; you\'re a real good girl! She sails beautifully. I\'ve been trying\r\nher on the pond. But it mustn\'t be a _present;_ you must let me pay you\r\nback when I get my allowance."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, Arthur, that would spoil it all," she answered quickly; "you\r\nare entirely welcome, and you know my allowance is so large that half\r\nthe time I have more money than I know how to spend."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see the time that would be the case with me," said\r\nhe, laughing. Then in a lower tone, "Elsie, I\'m sorry I teased you so.\r\nI\'ll not do it again soon."\r\n\r\nElsie answered him with a grateful look, as she stepped past him and\r\nquietly took her place at the table.\r\n\r\nArthur kept his word, and for many weeks entirely refrained from\r\nteasing Elsie, and while freed from that annoyance she was always able\r\nto have her tasks thoroughly prepared; and though her governess was\r\noften unreasonable and exacting, and there was scarcely a day in which\r\nshe was not called upon to yield her own wishes or pleasures, or in\r\nsome way to inconvenience herself to please Walter or Enna, or\r\noccasionally the older members of the family, yet it was an unusually\r\nhappy winter to her, for Rose Allison\'s love and uniform kindness shed\r\nsunshine on her path. She had learned to yield readily to others, and\r\nwhen fretted or saddened by unjust or unkind treatment, a few moments\r\nalone with her precious Bible and her loved Saviour made all right\r\nagain, and she would come from those sweet communings looking as\r\nserenely happy as if she had never known an annoyance. She was a wonder\r\nto all the family. Her grandfather would sometimes look at her as,\r\nwithout a frown or a pout, she would give up her own wishes to Enna,\r\nand shaking his head, say, "She\'s no Dinsmore, or she would know how to\r\nstand up for her own rights better than that. _I_ don\'t like such\r\ntame-spirited people. She\'s not Horace\'s child; it never was an easy\r\nmatter to impose upon or conquer him. He was a boy of spirit."\r\n\r\n"What a strange child Elsie is?" Adelaide remarked to her friend one\r\nday. "I am often surprised to see how sweetly she gives up to all of\r\nus; really she has a lovely temper. I quite envy her; it was always\r\nhard for me to give up my own way."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe it was easy for her at first," said Rose. "I think\r\nher sweet disposition is the fruit of a work of grace in her heart. It\r\nis the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which God alone can bestow."\r\n\r\n"I wish I had it, then," said Adelaide, sighing.\r\n\r\n"You have only to go to the right source to obtain it, dear Adelaide,"\r\nreplied her friend, gently.\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Adelaide, "I must say I sometimes think that, as papa\r\nsays, there is something mean-spirited and cowardly in always giving up\r\nto other people."\r\n\r\n"It would indeed be cowardly and wrong to give up _principle_," replied\r\nRose, "but surely it is noble and generous to give up our own wishes to\r\nanother, where no principle is involved."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, you are right," said Adelaide, musingly. "And now I\r\nrecollect that, readily as Elsie gives up her own wishes to others on\r\nordinary occasions, I have never known her to sacrifice principle; but,\r\non the contrary, she has several times made mamma excessively angry by\r\nrefusing to romp and play with Enna on the Sabbath, or to deceive papa\r\nwhen questioned with regard to some of Arthur\'s misdeeds; yet she has\r\noften borne the blame of his faults, when she might have escaped by\r\ntelling of him. Elsie is certainly very different from any of the rest\r\nof us, and if it is piety that makes her what she is, I think piety is\r\na very lovely thing."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s mornings were spent in the school-room; in the afternoon she\r\nwalked, or rode out, sometimes in company with her young uncles and\r\naunts, and sometimes alone, a negro boy following at a respectful\r\ndistance, as a protector. In the evening there was almost always\r\ncompany in the parlor, and she found it pleasanter to sit beside the\r\nbright wood-fire in her own room, with her fond old nurse for a\r\ncompanion, than to stay there, or with the younger ones in the\r\nsitting-room or nursery. If she had no lesson to learn, she usually\r\nread aloud to Chloe, as she sat knitting by the fire, and the Bible was\r\nthe book generally preferred by both; and then when she grew weary of\r\nreading, she would often take a stool, and sitting down close to Chloe,\r\nput her head in her lap, saying, "Now, mammy, tell me about mamma."\r\n\r\nAnd then for the hundredth time or more the old woman would go over the\r\nstory of the life and death of her "dear young missus," as she always\r\ncalled her; telling of her beauty, her goodness, and of her sorrows and\r\nsufferings during the last year of her short life.\r\n\r\nIt was a story which never lost its charm for Elsie; a story which the\r\none never wearied of telling, nor the other of hearing. Elsie would sit\r\nlistening, with her mother\'s miniature in her hand, gazing at it with\r\ntearful eyes, then press it to her lips, murmuring, "My own mamma;\r\npoor, dear mamma." And when Chloe had finished that story she would\r\nusually say, "Now, mammy, tell me all about papa."\r\n\r\nBut upon this subject Chloe had very little information to give. She\r\nknew him only as a gay, handsome young stranger, whom she had seen\r\noccasionally during a few months, and who had stolen all the sunshine\r\nfrom her beloved young mistress\' life, and left her to die alone; yet\r\nshe did not blame him when speaking to his child, for the young wife\r\nhad told her that he had not forsaken her of his own free choice; and\r\nthough she could not quite banish from her own mind the idea that he\r\nhad not been altogether innocent in the matter, she breathed no hint of\r\nit to Elsie; for Chloe was a sensible woman, and knew that to lead the\r\nlittle one to think ill of her only remaining parent would but tend to\r\nmake her unhappy.\r\n\r\nSometimes Elsie would ask very earnestly, "Do you thing papa loves\r\nJesus, mammy?" And Chloe would reply with a doubtful shake of the head,\r\n"Dunno, darlin\'; but ole Chloe prays for him ebery day."\r\n\r\n"And so do I," Elsie would answer; "dear, dear papa, how I wish he\r\nwould come home!"\r\n\r\nAnd so the winter glided away, and spring came, and Miss Allison must\r\nsoon return home. It was now the last day of March, and her departure\r\nhad been fixed for the second of April. For a number of weeks Elsie had\r\nbeen engaged, during all her spare moments, in knitting a purse for\r\nRose, wishing to give her something which was the work of her own\r\nhands, knowing that as such it would be more prized by her friend than\r\na costlier gift. She had just returned from her afternoon ride, and\r\ntaking out her work she sat down to finish it. She was in her own room,\r\nwith no companion but Chloe, who sat beside her knitting as usual.\r\n\r\nElsie worked on silently for some time, then suddenly holding up her\r\npurse, she exclaimed, "See, mammy, it is all done but putting on the\r\ntassel! Isn\'t it pretty? and won\'t dear Miss Allison be pleased with\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nIt really was very pretty indeed, of crimson and gold, and beautifully\r\nknit, and Chloe, looking at it with admiring eyes, said, "I spec she\r\nwill, darlin\'. I tink it\'s berry handsome."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Enna opened the door and came in.\r\n\r\nElsie hastily attempted to conceal the purse by thrusting it into her\r\npocket, but it was too late, for Enna had seen it, and running toward\r\nher, cried out, "Now, Elsie, just give that to me!"\r\n\r\n"No, Enna," replied Elsie, mildly, "I cannot let you have it, because\r\nit is for Miss Rose."\r\n\r\n"I will have it," exclaimed the child, resolutely, "and if you don\'t\r\ngive it to me at once I shall just go and tell mamma."\r\n\r\n"I will let you take it in your hand a few moments to look at it, if\r\nyou will be careful not to soil it, Enna," said Elsie, in the same\r\ngentle tone; "and if you wish, I will get some more silk and beads, and\r\nmake you one just like it; but I cannot give you this, because I would\r\nnot have time to make another for Miss Rose."\r\n\r\n"No, I shall just have that one; and I shall have it to keep," said\r\nEnna, attempting to snatch it out of Elsie\'s hand.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie held it up out of her reach, and after trying several times\r\nin vain to get it, Enna left the room, crying and screaming with\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nChloe locked the door, saying, "Great pity, darlin\', we forgot to do\r\ndat \'fore Miss Enna came. I\'se \'fraid she gwine bring missus for make\r\nyou gib um up."\r\n\r\nElsie sat down to her work again, but she was very pale, and her little\r\nhands trembled with agitation, and her soft eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\nChloe\'s fears were but too well founded; for the next moment hasty\r\nsteps were heard in the passage, and the handle of the door was laid\r\nhold of with no very gentle grasp; and then, as it refused to yield to\r\nher touch, Mrs. Dinsmore\'s voice was heard in an angry tone giving the\r\ncommand, "Open this door instantly."\r\n\r\nChloe looked at her young mistress.\r\n\r\n"You will have to," said Elsie, tearfully, slipping her work into her\r\npocket again, and lifting up her heart in prayer for patience and\r\nmeekness, for she well knew she would have need of both.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore entered, leading the sobbing Enna by the hand; her face\r\nwas flushed with passion, and addressing Elsie in tones of violent\r\nanger, she asked, "What is the meaning of all this, you\r\ngood-for-nothing hussy? Why are you always tormenting this poor child?\r\nWhere is that paltry trifle that all this fuss is about? let me see it\r\nthis instant."\r\n\r\nElsie drew the purse from her pocket, saying in tearful, trembling\r\ntones, "It is a purse I was making for Miss Rose, ma\'am; and I offered\r\nto make another just like it for Enna; but I cannot give her this one,\r\nbecause there would not be time to make another before Miss Rose goes\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"You _can_ not give it to her, indeed! You _will_ not, you mean; but I\r\nsay you _shall;_ and I\'ll see if I\'m not mistress in my own house. Give\r\nit to the child this instant; I\'ll not have her crying her eyes out\r\nthat you may be humored in all your whims. There are plenty of\r\nhandsomer ones to be had in the city, and if you are too mean to make\r\nher a present of it, I\'ll buy you another to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"But that would not be my work, and this is," replied Elsie, still\r\nretaining the purse, loath to let it go.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! what difference will that make to Miss Rose?" said Mrs.\r\nDinsmore; and snatching it out of her hand, she gave it to Enna,\r\nsaying, "There, my pet, you shall have it. Elsie is a naughty, mean,\r\nstingy girl, but she shan\'t plague you while your mamma\'s about."\r\n\r\nEnna cast a look of triumph at Elsie, and ran off with her prize,\r\nfollowed by her mother, while poor Elsie hid her face in Chloe\'s lap\r\nand cried bitterly.\r\n\r\nIt required all Chloe\'s religion to keep down her anger and indignation\r\nat this unjust and cruel treatment of her darling, and for a few\r\nmoments she allowed her to sob and cry without a word, only soothing\r\nher with mute caresses, not daring to trust her voice, lest her anger\r\nshould find vent in words. But at length, when her feelings had grown\r\nsomewhat calmer, she said soothingly, "Nebber mind it, my poor darlin\'\r\nchile. Just go to de city and buy de prettiest purse you can find, for\r\nMiss Rose."\r\n\r\nBut Elsie shook her head sadly. "I wanted it to be my own work," she\r\nsobbed, "and now there is no time."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'ll tell you what, my pet," exclaimed Chloe suddenly, "dere\'s de\r\npurse you was aknittin\' for your papa, an\' dey wouldn\'t send it for\r\nyou; you can get dat done for de lady, and knit another for your papa,\r\n\'fore he comes home."\r\n\r\nElsie raised her head with a look of relief, but her face clouded\r\nagain, as she replied, "But it is not quite done, and I haven\'t the\r\nbeads to finish it with, and Miss Rose goes day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Nebber mind dat, darlin\'," said Chloe, jumping up; "Pomp he been gwine\r\nto de city dis berry afternoon, an\' we\'ll tell him to buy de beads, an\'\r\nden you can get de purse finished \'fore to-morrow night, an\' de lady\r\ndon\'t go till de next day, an\' so it gwine all come right yet."\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, that will do; dear old mammy, I\'m so glad you thought of it,"\r\nsaid Elsie, joyfully. And rising, she went to her bureau, and unlocking\r\na drawer, took from it a bead purse of blue and gold, quite as handsome\r\nas the one of which she had been so ruthlessly despoiled, and rolling\r\nit up in a piece of paper, she handed it to Chloe, saying: "There,\r\nmammy, please give it to Pomp, and tell him to match the beads and the\r\nsilk exactly."\r\n\r\nChloe hastened in search of Pomp, but when she found him, he insisted\r\nthat he should not have time to attend to Miss Elsie\'s commission and\r\ndo his other errands; and Chloe, knowing that he, in common with all\r\nthe other servants, was very fond of the little girl, felt satisfied\r\nthat it was not merely an excuse, therefore did not urge her request.\r\nShe stood a moment in great perplexity, then suddenly exclaimed, "I\'ll\r\ngo myself. Miss Elsie will spare me, an\' I\'ll go right long wid you,\r\nPomp."\r\n\r\nChloe was entirely Elsie\'s servant, having no other business than to\r\nwait upon her and take care of her clothing and her room; and the\r\nlittle girl, of course, readily gave her permission to accompany Pomp\r\nand do the errand.\r\n\r\nBut it was quite late ere Chloe returned, and the little girl spent the\r\nevening alone in her own room. She was sadly disappointed that she\r\ncould not even have her hour with Miss Rose, who was detained in the\r\nparlor with company whom she could not leave, and so the evening seemed\r\nvery long and wore away very slowly.\r\n\r\nBut at last Chloe came, and in answer to her eager inquiries displayed\r\nher purchases with great satisfaction, saying, "Yes, darlin\', I\'se got\r\nde berry t\'ings you wanted."\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes," said Elsie, examining them with delight; "they are just\r\nright; and now I can finish it in a couple of hours."\r\n\r\n"Time to get ready for bed now, ain\'t it, pet?" asked Chloe; but before\r\nthe little girl had time to answer, a servant knocked at the door, and\r\nhanded in a note for her. It was from Miss Allison, and, hastily\r\ntearing it open, she read:\r\n\r\n"DEAR ELSIE--I am very sorry that we cannot have our reading together\r\nthis evening; but be sure, darling, to come to me early in the morning;\r\nit will be our last opportunity, for, dear child, I have another\r\ndisappointment for you. I had not expected to leave before day after\r\nto-morrow, but I have learned this evening that the vessel sails a day\r\nsooner than I had supposed, and therefore I shall be obliged to start\r\non my journey to-morrow.\r\n\r\n"Your friend,                                              ROSE."\r\n\r\nElsie dropped the note on the floor and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"What de matter, darlin\'?" asked Chloe, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Miss Rose, dear, _dear_ Miss Rose is going tomorrow," she sobbed.\r\nThen hastily drying her eyes, she said: "But I have no time for crying.\r\nI must sit up and finish the purse to-night, because there will not be\r\ntime to-morrow."\r\n\r\nIt was long past her usual hour for retiring when at last her task, or\r\nrather her labor of love, was completed. Yet she was up betimes, and at\r\nthe usual hour her gentle rap was heard at Miss Allison\'s door.\r\n\r\nRose clasped her in her arms and kissed her tenderly.\r\n\r\n"O Miss Rose! _dear, dear_ Miss Rose, what shall I do without you?"\r\nsobbed the little girl. "I shall have nobody to love me now but mammy."\r\n\r\n"You have another and a better friend, dear Elsie, who has said, \'I\r\nwill never leave thee, nor forsake thee,\'" whispered Rose, with another\r\ntender caress.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Elsie, wiping away her tears; "and He is your Friend, too;\r\nand don\'t you think, Miss Rose, He will bring us together again some\r\nday?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so indeed, darling. We must keep very close to Him, dear Elsie;\r\nwe must often commune with Him in secret; often study His word, and try\r\nalways to do His will. Ah! dear child, if we can only have the\r\nassurance that that dear Friend is with us--that we have His presence\r\nand His love, we shall be supremely happy, though separated from all\r\nearthly friends. I know, dear little one, that you have peculiar\r\ntrials, and that you often feel the want of sympathy and love; but you\r\nmay always find them in Jesus. And now we will have our reading and\r\nprayer as usual."\r\n\r\nShe took the little girl in her lap, and opening the Bible, read aloud\r\nthe fourteenth chapter of John, a part of that touching farewell of our\r\nSaviour to His sorrowing disciples; and then they knelt to pray. Elsie\r\nwas only a listener, for her little heart was too full to allow her to\r\nbe anything more.\r\n\r\n"My poor darling!" Rose said, again taking her in her arms, "we will\r\nhope to meet again before very long. Who knows but your papa may come\r\nhome, and some day bring you to see me. It seems not unlikely, as he is\r\nso fond of traveling."\r\n\r\nElsie looked up, smiling through her tears, "Oh! how delightful that\r\nwould be," she said. "But it seems as though my papa would never come,"\r\nshe added, with a deep-drawn sigh.\r\n\r\n"Well, darling, we can hope," Rose answered cheerfully. "And, dear\r\nchild, though we must be separated in body for a time, we can still\r\nmeet in spirit at the mercy-seat. Shall we not do so at this hour every\r\nmorning?"\r\n\r\nElsie gave a joyful assent.\r\n\r\n"And I shall write to you, darling," Rose said; "I will write on my\r\njourney, if I can, so that you will get the letter in a week from the\r\ntime I leave; and then you must write to me; will you?"\r\n\r\n"If you won\'t care for the mistakes, Miss Rose. But you know I am a\r\nvery little girl, and I wouldn\'t like to let Miss Day read my letter to\r\nyou, to correct it. But I shall be so very glad to get yours. I never\r\nhad a letter in my life."\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t care for mistakes at all, dear, and no one shall see your\r\nletters but myself," said Rose, kissing her. "I should be as sorry as\r\nyou to have Miss Day look at them."\r\n\r\nElsie drew out the purse and put it in her friend\'s hand, saying: "It\r\nis all my own work, dear Miss Rose; I thought you would value it more\r\nfor that."\r\n\r\n"And indeed I shall, darling," replied Rose, with tears of pleasure in\r\nher eyes. "It is beautiful in itself, but I shall value it ten times\r\nmore because it is your gift, and the work of your own dear little\r\nhands."\r\n\r\nBut the breakfast-bell now summoned them to join the rest of the\r\nfamily, and, in a few moments after they left the table, the carriage\r\nwhich was to take Rose to the city was at the door. Rose had endeared\r\nherself to all, old and young, and they were loath to part with her.\r\nOne after another bade her an affectionate farewell. Elsie was the\r\nlast. Rose pressed her tenderly to her bosom, and kissed her again and\r\nagain, saying, in a voice half choked with grief, "God bless and keep\r\nyou, my poor little darling; my dear, dear little Elsie!"\r\n\r\nElsie could not speak; and the moment the carriage had rolled away with\r\nher friend, she went to her own room, and locking herself in, cried\r\nlong and bitterly. She had learned to love Rose very dearly, and to\r\nlean upon her very much; and now the parting from her, with no\r\ncertainty of ever meeting her again in this world, was the severest\r\ntrial the poor child had ever known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRD\r\n\r\n\r\n   "The morning blush was lighted up by hope--\r\n    The hope of meeting him."\r\n                                 --Miss LANDON.\r\n\r\n   "Unkindness, do thy office; poor heart, break."\r\n\r\n\r\nA week had now passed away since Miss Allison\'s departure, and Elsie,\r\nto whom it had been a sad and lonely one, was beginning to look eagerly\r\nfor her first letter.\r\n\r\n"It is just a week to-day since Rose left," remarked Adelaide at the\r\nbreakfast table, "and I think we ought to hear from her soon. She\r\npromised to write on her journey. Ah! here comes Pomp with the letters\r\nnow," she added, as the servant man entered the room bearing in his\r\nhand the bag in which he always brought the letters of the family from\r\nthe office in the neighboring city, whither he was sent every morning.\r\n\r\n"Pomp, you are late this morning," said Mrs. Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n"Yes, missus," replied the negro, scratching his head, "de horses am\r\nberry lazy; spec dey\'s got de spring fever."\r\n\r\n"Do make haste, papa, and see if there is not one from Rose," said\r\nAdelaide coaxingly, as her father took the bag, and very deliberately\r\nadjusted his spectacles before opening it.\r\n\r\n"Have patience, young lady," said he. "Yes, here is a letter for you,\r\nand one for Elsie," tossing them across the table as he spoke.\r\n\r\nElsie eagerly seized hers and ran away to her own room to read it. It\r\nwas a feast to her, this first letter, and from such a dear friend,\r\ntoo. It gave her almost as much pleasure for the moment as Miss Rose\'s\r\npresence could have afforded.\r\n\r\nShe had just finished its perusal and was beginning it again, when she\r\nheard Adelaide\'s voice calling her by name, and the next moment she\r\nentered the room, saying: "Well, Elsie, I suppose you have read your\r\nletter; and now I have another piece of news for you. Can you guess\r\nwhat it is?" she asked, looking at her with a strange smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, Aunt Adelaide; please tell me. Is dear Miss Rose coming back?"\r\n\r\n"O! nonsense; what a guess!" said Adelaide. "No, stranger than that. My\r\nbrother Horace--your papa--has actually sailed for America, and is\r\ncoming directly home."\r\n\r\nElsie sprang up, her cheeks flushed, and her little heart beating\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n"O Aunt Adelaide!" she cried, "is it really true? is he coming? and\r\nwill he be here soon?"\r\n\r\n"He has really started at last; but how soon he will be here I don\'t\r\nknow," replied her aunt, turning to leave the room. "I have told you\r\nall I know about it."\r\n\r\nElsie clasped her hands together, and sank down upon a sofa, Miss\r\nRose\'s letter, prized so highly a moment before, lying unheeded at her\r\nfeet; for her thoughts were far away, following that unknown parent as\r\nhe crossed the ocean; trying to imagine how he would look, how he would\r\nspeak, what would be his feelings toward her.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she asked, with a beating heart, "_will_ he _love_ me? My own\r\npapa! will he let me love him? will he take me in his arms and call me\r\nhis own darling child?"\r\n\r\nBut who could answer the anxious inquiry? She must just wait until the\r\nslow wheels of time should bring the much longed-for, yet sometimes\r\nhalf-dreaded arrival.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s lessons were but indifferently recited that morning, and Miss\r\nDay frowned, and said in a tone of severity that it did not agree with\r\nher to receive letters; and that, unless she wished her papa to be much\r\ndispleased with her on his expected arrival, she must do a great deal\r\nbetter than that.\r\n\r\nShe had touched the right chord then; for Elsie, intensely anxious to\r\nplease that unknown father, and, if possible, gain his approbation and\r\naffection, gave her whole mind to her studies with such a determined\r\npurpose that the governess could find no more cause for complaint.\r\n\r\nBut while the child is looking forward to the expected meeting with\r\nsuch longing affection for him, how is it with the father?\r\n\r\nHorace Dinsmore was, like his father, an upright, moral man, who paid\r\nan outward respect to the forms of religion, but cared nothing for the\r\nvital power of godliness; trusted entirely to his morality, and looked\r\nupon Christians as hypocrites and deceivers. He had been told that his\r\nlittle Elsie was one of these, and, though he would not have\r\nacknowledged it even to himself, it had prejudiced him against her.\r\nThen, too, in common with all the Dinsmores, he had a great deal of\r\nfamily pride; and, though old Mr. Grayson had been a man of sterling\r\nworth, intelligent, honest, and pious, and had died very wealthy, yet\r\nbecause he was known to have begun life as a poor boy, the whole family\r\nwere accustomed to speak as though Horace had stooped very much in\r\nmarrying his heiress.\r\n\r\nAnd Horace himself had come to look upon his early marriage as a piece\r\nof boyish folly, of which he was rather ashamed; and so constantly had\r\nMr. Dinsmore spoken in his letters of Elsie as "old Grayson\'s\r\ngrandchild," that he had got into the habit of looking upon her as a\r\nkind of disgrace to him; especially as she had always been described to\r\nhim as a disagreeable, troublesome child.\r\n\r\nHe had loved his wife with all the warmth of his passionate nature, and\r\nhad mourned bitterly over her untimely death; but years of study,\r\ntravel and worldly pleasures had almost banished her image from his\r\nmind, and he seldom thought of her except in connection with the child\r\nfor whom he felt a secret dislike.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything but the expected arrival was now spoken or thought of\r\nat Roselands, and Elsie was not the only one to whom old Time seemed to\r\nmove with an unusually laggard pace.\r\n\r\nBut at length a letter came telling them that they might look upon it\r\nas being but one day in advance of its writer; and now all was bustle\r\nand preparation.\r\n\r\n"O mammy, mammy!" exclaimed Elsie, jumping up and down, and clapping\r\nher hands for joy, as she came in from her afternoon ride, "just think!\r\npapa, dear papa, will be here to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nShe seemed wild with delight; but suddenly sobered down, and a look of\r\ncare stole over the little face, as the torturing question recurred to\r\nher mind, "_Will he love me?_"\r\n\r\nShe stood quite still, with her eyes fixed thoughtfully, and almost\r\nsadly, upon the floor, while Chloe took off her riding dress and cap\r\nand smoothed her hair. As she finished arranging her dress she clasped\r\nthe little form in her arms, and pressed a fond kiss on the fair brow,\r\nthinking to herself that was the sweetest and loveliest little face she\r\nhad ever looked upon.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment an unusual bustle was heard in the house.\r\n\r\nElsie started, changed color, and stood listening with a throbbing\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nPresently little feet were heard running rapidly down the hall, and\r\nWalter, throwing open the door, called out, "Elsie, he\'s come!" and\r\ncatching her hand, hurried her along to the parlor door.\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, Walter," she gasped as they reached it; and she leaned\r\nagainst the wall, her heart throbbing so wildly she could scarcely\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" said he, "are you ill? come along;" and pushing\r\nthe door open, he rushed in, dragging her after him.\r\n\r\nSo over-wrought were the child\'s feelings that she nearly fainted;\r\neverything in the room seemed to be turning round, and for an instant\r\nshe scarcely knew where she was.\r\n\r\nBut a strange voice asked, "And who is this?" and looking up as her\r\ngrandfather pronounced her name, she saw a stranger standing before\r\nher--very handsome, and very youthful-looking, in spite of a heavy dark\r\nbeard and mustache--who exclaimed hastily, "What! this great girl _my_\r\nchild? really it is enough to make a man feel old."\r\n\r\nThen, taking her hand, he stooped and coldly kissed her lips.\r\n\r\nShe was trembling violently, and the very depth of her feelings kept\r\nher silent and still; her hand lay still in his, cold and clammy.\r\n\r\nHe held it an instant, at the same time gazing searchingly into her\r\nface; then dropped it, saying in a tone of displeasure, "I am not an\r\nogre, that you need be so afraid of me; but there, you may go; I will\r\nnot keep you in terror any longer."\r\n\r\nShe rushed away to her own room, and there, throwing herself upon the\r\nbed, wept long and wildly. It was the disappointment of a lifelong\r\nhope. Since her earliest recollection she had looked and longed for\r\nthis hour; and it seemed as though the little heart would break with\r\nits weight of bitter anguish.\r\n\r\nShe was all alone, for Chloe had gone down to the kitchen to talk over\r\nthe arrival, not doubting that her darling was supremely happy in the\r\npossession of her long looked-for parent.\r\n\r\nAnd so the little girl lay there with her crushed and bleeding heart,\r\nsobbing, mourning, weeping as though she would weep her very life away,\r\nwithout an earthly friend to speak one word of comfort.\r\n\r\n"O papa, papa!" she sobbed, "my own papa, you do not love me; me, your\r\nown little girl. Oh! my heart will break. O mamma, mamma! if I could\r\nonly go to you; for there is no one here to love me, and I am so\r\nlonely, oh! _so_ lonely and desolate."\r\n\r\nAnd thus Chloe found her, when she came in an hour later, weeping and\r\nsobbing out such broken exclamations of grief and anguish.\r\n\r\nShe was much surprised, but comprehending at once how her child was\r\nsuffering, she raised her up in her strong arms, and laying the little\r\nhead lovingly against her bosom, she smoothed the tangled hair, kissed\r\nthe tear-swollen eyes, and bathed the throbbing temples, saying, "My\r\nprecious pet, my darlin\' chile, your ole mammy loves you better dan\r\nlife; an\' did my darlin\' forget de almighty Friend dat says, _I_ have\r\nloved thee with an everlasting love,\' an\' \'I will never leave thee, nor\r\nforsake thee\'? He sticks closer dan a brudder, precious chile, and\r\nsays,\'though a woman forget her sucking child, He will not forget _His_\r\nchillen.\' Mothers love dere chillens better dan fathers, darlin\', and\r\nso you see Jesus\' love is better dan all other love; and I _knows_ you\r\nhes got dat."\r\n\r\n"O mammy! ask Him to take me to Himself, and to mamma--for oh! I am\r\nvery lonely, and I want to die!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, darlin\'; old Chloe nebber could ask dat; dis ole heart\r\nwould break for sure. Yous all de world to your old mammy, darlin\'; and\r\nyou know we must all wait de Lord\'s time."\r\n\r\n"Then ask Him to help me to be patient," she said, in a weary tone.\r\n"And O mammy!" she added, with a burst of bitter tears, "ask Him to\r\nmake my father love me."\r\n\r\n"I will, darlin\', I will," sobbed Chloe, pressing the little form\r\ncloser to her heart; "an\' don\'t you go for to be discouraged right\r\naway; for I\'se sure Massa Horace must love you, fore long."\r\n\r\nThe tea-bell rang, and the family gathered about the table; but one\r\nchair remained unoccupied.\r\n\r\n"Where is Miss Elsie?" asked Adelaide of one of the servants.\r\n\r\n"Dunno, missus," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, go and see," said Adelaide; "perhaps she did not hear the\r\nbell."\r\n\r\nThe servant returned in a moment, saying that Miss Elsie had a bad\r\nheadache and did not want any supper. Mr. Horace Dinsmore paused in the\r\nconversation he was carrying on with his father, to listen to the\r\nservant\'s announcement. "I hope she is not a sickly child," said he,\r\naddressing Adelaide; "is she subject to such attacks?"\r\n\r\n"Not very," replied his sister dryly, for she had seen the meeting, and\r\nfelt really sorry for Elsie\'s evident disappointment; "I imagine crying\r\nhas brought this on."\r\n\r\nHe colored violently, and said in a tone of great displeasure, "Truly,\r\nthe return of a parent _is_ a cause for grief; yet I hardly expected my\r\npresence to be quite so distressing to my only child. I had no idea\r\nthat she had already learned to dislike me so thoroughly."\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t," said Adelaide, "she has been looking and longing for\r\nyour return ever since I have known her."\r\n\r\n"Then she has certainly been disappointed in me; her grief is not at\r\nall complimentary, explain it as you will."\r\n\r\nAdelaide made no reply, for she saw that he was determined to put an\r\nunfavorable construction upon Elsie\'s conduct, and feared that any\r\ndefence she could offer would only increase his displeasure.\r\n\r\nIt was a weary, aching head the little girl laid upon her pillow that\r\nnight, and the little heart was sad and sore; yet she was not\r\naltogether comfortless, for she had turned in her sorrow to Him who has\r\nsaid, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them\r\nnot," and she had the sweet assurance of _His_ love and favor.\r\n\r\nIt was with a trembling heart, hoping yet fearing, longing and yet\r\ndreading to see her father, that Elsie descended to the breakfast-room\r\nthe next morning. She glanced timidly around, but he was not there.\r\n\r\n"Where is papa, Aunt Adelaide?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"He is not coming down to breakfast, as he feels quite fatigued with\r\nhis journey," replied her aunt; "so you will not see him this morning,\r\nand perhaps not at all to-day, for there will be a good deal of company\r\nhere this afternoon and evening."\r\n\r\nElsie sighed, and looked sadly disappointed. She found it very\r\ndifficult to attend to her lessons that morning, and every time the\r\ndoor opened she started and looked up, half hoping it might be her papa.\r\n\r\nBut he did not come; and when the dinner hour arrived, the children\r\nwere told that they were to dine in the nursery, on account of the\r\nlarge number of guests to be entertained in the dining-room. The\r\ncompany remained until bedtime; she was not called down to the parlor;\r\nand so saw nothing of her father that day.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning Chloe told her the children were to breakfast with\r\nthe family, as all the visitors had left excepting one or two\r\ngentlemen. So Elsie went down to the breakfast-room, where, to her\r\nsurprise, she found her papa sitting alone, reading the morning paper.\r\n\r\nHe looked up as she entered.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, papa," she said, in half-trembling tones.\r\n\r\nHe started a little--for it was the first time he had ever been\r\naddressed by that title, and it sounded strange to his ears--gave her a\r\nglance of mingled curiosity and interest, half held out his hand, but\r\ndrawing it back again, simply said, "Good-morning, Elsie," and returned\r\nto his paper.\r\n\r\nElsie stood irresolutely in the middle of the floor, wanting, yet not\r\ndaring to go to him.\r\n\r\nBut just at that instant the door opened, and Enna, looking rosy and\r\nhappy, came running in, and rushing up to her brother, climbed upon his\r\nknee, and put her arms around his neck, saying, "Good-morning, brother\r\nHorace. I want a kiss."\r\n\r\n"You shall have it, little pet," said he, throwing down his paper.\r\n\r\nThen, kissing her several times and hugging her in his arms, he said,\r\n"_You_ are not afraid of me, are you? nor sorry that I have come home?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Enna.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Elsie as she stood looking at them, her large soft eyes\r\nfull of tears. She could not help feeling that Enna had her place, and\r\nwas receiving the caresses that should have been lavished upon herself.\r\n\r\n"Jealous," thought her father; "I cannot bear jealous people;" and he\r\ngave her a look of displeasure that cut her to the heart, and she\r\nturned quickly away and left the room to hide the tears she could no\r\nlonger keep back.\r\n\r\n"I am envious," she thought, "jealous of Enna. Oh! how wicked!" And she\r\nprayed silently, "Dear Saviour, help me! take away these sinful\r\nfeelings."\r\n\r\nYoung as she was, she was learning to have some control over her\r\nfeelings, and in a few moments she had so far recovered her composure\r\nas to be able to return to the breakfast-room and take her place at the\r\ntable, where the rest were already seated, her sweet little face sad\r\nindeed and bearing the traces of tears, but quite calm and peaceful.\r\n\r\nHer father took no further notice of her, and she did not dare trust\r\nherself to look at him. The servants filled her plate, and she ate in\r\nsilence, feeling it a great relief that all were too busily engaged in\r\ntalking and eating to pay any attention to her. She scarcely raised her\r\neyes from her plate, and did not know how often a strange gentleman,\r\nwho sat nearly opposite, fixed his upon her.\r\n\r\nAs she left the room at the conclusion of the meal, he asked, while\r\nfollowing her with his eyes, "Is that one of your sisters, Dinsmore?"\r\n\r\n"No," said he, coloring slightly; "she is my daughter."\r\n\r\n"Ah, indeed!" said his friend. "I remember to have heard that you had a\r\nchild, but had forgotten it. Well, you have no reason to be ashamed of\r\nher; she is lovely, perfectly lovely! has the sweetest little face I\r\never saw."\r\n\r\n"Will you ride, Travilla?" asked Mr. Dinsmore hastily, as though\r\nanxious to change the subject.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if I do," was the reply, and they went out together.\r\n\r\nSome hours later in the day Elsie was at the piano in the music-room\r\npractising, when a sudden feeling that some one was in the room caused\r\nher to turn and look behind her.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla was standing there.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said he, bowing politely, "but I heard the sound of the\r\ninstrument, and, being very fond of music, I ventured to walk in."\r\n\r\nElsie was very modest, and rather timid, too, but also very polite; so\r\nshe said, "No excuse is necessary; but will you not take a seat, sir?\r\nthough I fear my music will not afford you any pleasure, for you know I\r\nam only a little girl, and cannot play very well yet."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said he, taking a seat by her side. "And now will you do\r\nme the favor to repeat the song I heard you singing a few moments\r\nsince?"\r\n\r\nElsie immediately complied, though her cheeks burned, and her voice\r\ntrembled at first from embarrassment; but it grew stronger as she\r\nproceeded and in the last verse was quite steady and full. She had a\r\nvery fine voice for a child of her age; its sweetness was remarkable\r\nboth in singing and speaking; and she had also a good deal of musical\r\ntalent, which had been well cultivated, for she had had good teachers,\r\nand had practised with great patience and perseverance. Her music was\r\nsimple, as suited her years, but her performance of it was very good\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla thanked her very heartily, and complimented her singing;\r\nthen asked for another and another song, another and another piece,\r\nchatting with her about each, until they grew quite familiar, and Elsie\r\nlost all feeling of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Elsie, I think, is your name, is it not?" he asked after a little.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said she, "Elsie Dinsmore."\r\n\r\n"And you are the daughter of my friend, Mr. Horace Dinsmore?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Your papa has been absent a long time, and I suppose you must have\r\nquite forgotten him."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, not _forgotten_, for I never had seen him."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said he, in a tone of surprise; "then, since he is an entire\r\nstranger to you, I suppose you cannot have much affection for him?"\r\n\r\nElsie raised her large, dark eyes to his face, with an expression of\r\nastonishment. "Not love papa, my own dear papa, who has no child but\r\nme? Oh! sir, how could you think that?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I see I was mistaken," said he, smiling; "I thought you could\r\nhardly care for him at all; but do you think that he loves you?"\r\n\r\nElsie dropped her face into her hands, and burst into an agony of tears.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman looked extremely vexed with himself.\r\n\r\n"My poor little girl, my poor, dear little girl," he said, stroking her\r\nhair, "forgive me. I am very, _very_ sorry for my thoughtless question.\r\nDo be comforted, my poor child, for whether your papa loves you now or\r\nnot, I am quite sure he soon will."\r\n\r\nElsie now dried her tears, rose and closed the instrument. He assisted\r\nher, and then asked if she would not take a little walk with him in the\r\ngarden. She complied, and, feeling really very sorry for the wound he\r\nhad so thoughtlessly inflicted, as well as interested in his little\r\ncompanion, he exerted all his powers to entertain her--talked with her\r\nabout the plants and flowers, described those he had seen in foreign\r\nlands, and related incidents of travel, usually choosing those in which\r\nher father had borne a part, because he perceived that they were doubly\r\ninteresting to her.\r\n\r\nElsie, having been thrown very much upon her own resources for\r\namusement, and having a natural love for books, and constant access to\r\nher grandfather\'s well-stocked library, had read many more, and with\r\nmuch more thought, than most children of her age, so that Mr. Travilla\r\nfound her a not uninteresting companion, and was often surprised at the\r\nintelligence shown by her questions and replies.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner-bell rang he led her in, and seated her by himself, and\r\nnever was any lady more carefully waited upon than little Elsie at this\r\nmeal. Two or three other gentlemen guests were present, giving their\r\nattention to the older ladies of the company, and thus Mr. Travilla\r\nseemed to feel quite at liberty to devote himself entirely to her,\r\nattending to all her wants, talking with her, and making her talk.\r\n\r\nElsie now and then stole a glance at Mrs. Dinsmore, fearing her\r\ndispleasure; but to her great relief, the lady seemed too much occupied\r\nto notice her. Once she looked timidly at her father, and her eyes met\r\nhis. He was looking at her with an expression half curious, half\r\namused. She was at a loss to understand the look, but, satisfied that\r\nthere was no displeasure in it, her heart grew light, and her cheeks\r\nflushed with happiness.\r\n\r\n"Really, Dinsmore," said Mr. Travilla, as they stood together near one\r\nof the windows of the drawing-room soon after dinner, "your little girl\r\nis remarkably intelligent, as well as remarkably pretty; and I have\r\ndiscovered that she has quite a good deal of musical talent."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! I think it is quite a pity that she does not belong to you,\r\nTravilla, instead of me, since you seem to appreciate her so much more\r\nhighly," replied the father, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I wish she did," said his friend. "But, seriously, Dinsmore, you ought\r\nto love that child, for she certainly loves you devotedly."\r\n\r\nHe looked surprised. "How do you know?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It was evident enough from what I saw and heard this morning.\r\nDinsmore, she would value a caress from you more than the richest\r\njewel."\r\n\r\n"Doubtful," replied Horace, hastily quitting the room, for Elsie had\r\ncome out on to the portico in her riding suit, and Jim, her usual\r\nattendant, was bringing up her horse.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to ride, Elsie?" asked her father, coming up to her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she said, raising her eyes to his face.\r\n\r\nHe lifted her in his arms and placed her on the horse, saying to the\r\nservant as he did so, "Now, Jim, you must take good care of my little\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\nTears of happiness rose in Elsie\'s eyes as she turned her horse\'s head\r\nand rode down the avenue. "He called me _his_ little girl," she\r\nmurmured to herself, "and bade Jim take good care of me. Oh! he _will_\r\nlove me soon, as good, kind Mr. Travilla said he would."\r\n\r\nHer father was still standing on the portico, looking after her.\r\n\r\n"How well she sits her horse!" remarked Travilla, who had stepped out\r\nand stood close by his side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think she does," was the reply, in an absent tone. He was\r\nthinking of a time, some eight or nine years before, when he had\r\nassisted another Elsie to mount her horse, and had ridden for hours at\r\nher side.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon memories of the past came crowding thickly on his\r\nmind, and an emotion of tenderness began to spring up in his heart\r\ntoward the child of her who had once been so dear to him; and as he saw\r\nthe little girl ride up to the house on her return, he again went out,\r\nand lifting her from her horse, asked kindly, "Had you a pleasant ride,\r\nmy dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, papa, very pleasant," she said, looking up at him with a face\r\nbeaming with delight. He stooped and kissed her, saying, "I think I\r\nshall ride with you one of these days; should you like it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! so very, _very_ much, papa," she answered, eagerly.\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her earnestness, and she hastened away to her room to\r\nchange her dress and tell Chloe of her happiness.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was but a transient gleam of sunshine that darted across her\r\npath, to be lost again almost instantly behind the gathering clouds.\r\n\r\nMore company came, so that the drawing-room was quite full in the\r\nevening; and, though Elsie was there, her father seemed too much\r\noccupied with the guests to give her even a glance. She sat alone and\r\nunnoticed in a corner, her eyes following him wherever he moved, and\r\nher ear strained to catch every tone of his voice; until Mr. Travilla,\r\ndisengaging himself from a group of ladies and gentlemen on the\r\nopposite side of the room, came up to her, and taking her by the hand,\r\nled her to a pleasant-looking elderly lady, who sat at a centre-table\r\nexamining some choice engravings which Mr. Dinsmore had brought with\r\nhim from Europe.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Mr. Travilla, "This is my little friend Elsie."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said she, giving the little girl a kiss, "I am glad to see you,\r\nmy dear."\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla set a chair for her close to his mother and then sat down\r\non her other side, and taking up the engravings one after another, he\r\nexplained them to her in a most entertaining manner, generally having\r\nsome anecdote to tell in connection with each.\r\n\r\nElsie was so much amused and delighted with what he was saying that she\r\nat last quite forgot her father, and did not notice where he was.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Travilla laid down the engraving he had in his hand,\r\nsaying: "Come, Miss Elsie, I want my mother to hear you play and sing;\r\nwill you not do me the favor to repeat that song I admired so much this\r\nmorning?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Mr. Travilla!" exclaimed the little girl, blushing and trembling,\r\n"I could not play or sing before so many people. Please excuse me."\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said her father\'s voice just at her side, "go _immediately,_\r\nand do as the gentleman requests."\r\n\r\nHis tone was very stern, and as she lifted her eyes to his face, she\r\nsaw that his look was still more so; and tremblingly and tearfully she\r\nrose to obey.\r\n\r\n"Stay," said Mr. Travilla kindly, pitying her distress, "I withdraw my\r\nrequest."\r\n\r\n"But I do _not_ withdraw my command," said her father in the same stern\r\ntone; "go at once, Elsie, and do as I bid you."\r\n\r\nShe obeyed instantly, struggling hard to overcome her emotion.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla, scolding himself inwardly all the time for having brought\r\nher into such trouble, selected her music, and placing it before her as\r\nshe took her seat at the instrument, whispered encouragingly, "Now,\r\nMiss Elsie, only have confidence in yourself; that is all that is\r\nnecessary to your success."\r\n\r\nBut Elsie was not only embarrassed, but her heart was well-nigh broken\r\nby her father\'s sternness, and the tears _would_ fill her eyes so that\r\nshe could see neither notes nor words. She attempted to play the\r\nprelude, but blundered sadly, her embarrassment increasing every moment.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Mr. Travilla, "never mind the prelude, but just\r\nbegin the song."\r\n\r\nShe made the attempt, but fairly broke down, and burst into tears\r\nbefore she had got through the first verse. Her father had come up\r\nbehind her, and was standing there, looking much mortified.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," he said, leaning down and speaking in a low, stern tone, close\r\nto her ear, "I am ashamed of you; go to your room and to your bed\r\nimmediately."\r\n\r\nWith a heart almost bursting with grief and mortification she obeyed\r\nhim, and her pillow was wet with many bitter tears ere the weary eyes\r\nclosed in slumber.\r\n\r\nWhen she came down the next morning she learned to her great grief that\r\nMr. Travilla and his mother had returned to their own home; she was\r\nvery sorry she had not been permitted to say good-bye to her friend,\r\nand for several days she felt very sad and lonely, for all her father\'s\r\ncoldness of manner had returned, and he scarcely ever spoke to her;\r\nwhile the younger members of the family ridiculed her for her failure\r\nin attempting to play for company; and Miss Day, who seemed unusually\r\ncross and exacting, often taunted her with it also.\r\n\r\nThese were sad, dark days for the little girl; she tried most earnestly\r\nto attend to all her duties, but so depressed were her spirits, so\r\ntroubled was her mind, that she failed repeatedly in her lessons, and\r\nso was in continual disgrace with Miss Day, who threatened more than\r\nonce to tell her papa.\r\n\r\nIt was a threat which Elsie dreaded extremely to have put in execution,\r\nand Miss Day, seeing that it distressed her, used it the more\r\nfrequently, and thus kept the poor child in constant terror.\r\n\r\nHow to gain her father\'s love was the constant subject of her thoughts,\r\nand she tried in many ways to win his affection. She always yielded a\r\nready and cheerful obedience to his commands, and strove to anticipate\r\nand fulfil all his wishes. But he seldom noticed her, unless to give a\r\ncommand or administer a rebuke, while he lavished many a caress upon\r\nhis little sister, Enna. Often Elsie would watch him fondling her,\r\nuntil, unable any longer to control her feelings, she would rush away\r\nto her own room to weep and mourn in secret, and pray that her father\r\nmight some day learn to love her. She never complained even to poor old\r\nAunt Chloe, but the anxious nurse watched all these things with the\r\njealous eye of affection; she saw that her child--as she delighted to\r\ncall her--was very unhappy, and was growing pale and melancholy; and\r\nher heart ached for her, and many were the tears she shed in secret\r\nover the sorrows of her nursling.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t \'pear so sorrowful, darlin\'," she sometimes said to her; "try to\r\nbe merry, like Miss Enna, and run and jump on Massa Horace\'s knee, and\r\nden I tink he will like you better."\r\n\r\n"O mammy! I _can\'t_," Elsie would say; "I don\'t dare to do it."\r\n\r\nAnd Chloe would sigh and shake her head sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "With more capacity for love than earth\r\n    Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth."\r\n                                 --BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          "What are our hopes?\r\n   Like garlands, on afflictions\'s forehead worn,\r\n   Kissed in the morning, and at evening torn."\r\n                   --DAVENPORT\'S _King John and Matilda._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch had been the state of affairs for about a week, when one morning\r\nElsie and her father met at the breakfast-room door.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, papa," she said timidly.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Elsie," he replied in an unusually pleasant tone.\r\n\r\nThen, taking her by the hand, he led her in and seated her beside\r\nhimself at the table.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s cheek glowed and her eyes sparkled with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThere were several guests present, and she waited patiently while they\r\nand the older members of the family were being helped. At length it was\r\nher turn.\r\n\r\n"Elsie, will you have some meat?" asked her grandfather.\r\n\r\n"No," said her father, answering for her; "once a day is as often as a\r\nchild of her age ought to eat meat; she may have it at dinner, but\r\nnever for breakfast or tea."\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Dinsmore laughed, saying, "Really, Horace, I had no idea\r\nyou were so notionate. I always allowed you to eat whatever you\r\npleased, and I never saw that it hurt you. But, of course, you must\r\nmanage your own child in your own way."\r\n\r\n"If you please, papa, I had rather have some of those hot cakes," said\r\nElsie, timidly, as her father laid a slice of bread upon her plate.\r\n\r\n"No," said he decidedly; "I don\'t approve of hot bread for children;\r\nyou must eat the cold." Then to a servant who was setting down a cup of\r\ncoffee beside the little girl\'s plate, "Take that away, Pomp, and bring\r\nMiss Elsie a tumbler of milk. Or would you prefer water, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"Milk, if you please, papa," she replied with a little sigh; for she\r\nwas extremely fond of coffee, and it was something of a trial to give\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nHer father put a spoonful of stewed fruit upon her plate, and as Pompey\r\nset down a tumbler of rich milk beside it, said, "Now you have your\r\nbreakfast before you, Elsie. Children in England are not allowed to eat\r\nbutter until they are ten or eleven years of age, and I think it an\r\nexcellent plan, to make them grow up rosy and healthy. I have neglected\r\nmy little girl too long, but I intend to begin to take good care of her\r\nnow," he added, with a smile, and laying his hand for an instant upon\r\nher head.\r\n\r\nThe slight caress and the few kind words were quite enough to reconcile\r\nElsie to the rather meagre fare, and she ate it with a happy heart. But\r\nthe meagre fare became a constant thing, while the caresses and kind\r\nwords were not; and though she submitted without a murmur, she could\r\nnot help sometimes looking with longing eyes at the coffee and hot\r\nbuttered rolls, of which she was very fond. But she tried to be\r\ncontented, saying to herself, "Papa knows best, and I ought to be\r\nsatisfied with whatever he gives me."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it delightful to have your papa at home, Elsie?" Mr. Dinsmore\r\none morning overheard Arthur saying to his little girl in a mocking\r\ntone. "It\'s very pleasant to live on bread and water, isn\'t it, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I _don\'t_ live on bread and water," Elsie replied, a little\r\nindignantly. "Papa always allows me to have as much good, rich milk,\r\nand cream, and fruit as I want, or I can have eggs, or cheese, or\r\nhoney, or anything else, except meat and hot cakes, and butter, and\r\ncoffee; and who wouldn\'t rather do without such things all their lives\r\nthan not have a papa to love them? And besides, you know, Arthur, that\r\nI can have all the meat I want at dinner."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! that\'s nothing; and _I_ wouldn\'t give much for all the love\r\n_you_ get from him," said Arthur, scornfully.\r\n\r\nThere was something like a sob from Elsie; and as her father rose and\r\nwent to the window, he just caught a glimpse of her white dress\r\ndisappearing down the garden walk.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, sir, by teasing Elsie in that manner?" he exclaimed\r\nangrily to Arthur, who still stood where the little girl had left him,\r\nleaning against one of the pillars of the portico.\r\n\r\n"I only wanted to have a little fun," returned the boy doggedly.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I don\'t approve of such fun, and you will please to let the\r\nchild alone in future," replied his brother as he returned to his\r\nnewspaper again.\r\n\r\nBut somehow the paper had lost its interest. He seemed constantly to\r\nhear that little sob, and to see a little face all wet with tears of\r\nwounded feeling.\r\n\r\nJust then the school-bell rang, and suddenly throwing down his paper,\r\nhe took a card from his pocket, wrote a few words upon it, and calling\r\na servant, said, "Take this to Miss Day."\r\n\r\nElsie was seated at her desk, beginning her morning\'s work, when the\r\nservant entered and handed the card to the governess.\r\n\r\nMiss Day glanced at it and said:\r\n\r\n"Elsie, your father wants you. You may go."\r\n\r\nElsie rose in some trepidation and left the room, wondering what her\r\npapa could want with her.\r\n\r\n"Where is papa, Fanny?" she asked of the servant.\r\n\r\n"In de drawin\'-room, Miss Elsie," was the reply; and she hastened to\r\nseek him there.\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand as she entered, saying with a smile, "Come here,\r\ndaughter."\r\n\r\nIt was the first time he had called her that, and it sent a thrill of\r\njoy to her heart.\r\n\r\nShe sprang to his side, and, taking her hand in one of his, and laying\r\nthe other gently on her head, and bending it back a little, he looked\r\nkeenly into her face. It was bright enough now, yet the traces of tears\r\nwere very evident.\r\n\r\n"You have been crying," he said, in a slightly reproving tone. "I am\r\nafraid you do a great deal more of that than is good for you. It is a\r\nvery babyish habit, and you must try to break yourself of it."\r\n\r\nThe little face flushed painfully, and the eyes filled again.\r\n\r\n"There," he said, stroking her hair, "don\'t begin it again. I am going\r\nto drive over to Ion, where your friend Mr. Travilla lives, to spend\r\nthe day; would my little daughter like to go with me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! so _very_ much, papa!" she answered eagerly.\r\n\r\n"There are no little folks there," he said smiling, "nobody to see but\r\nMr. Travilla and his mother. But I see you want to go; so run and ask\r\nAunt Chloe to get you ready. Tell her I want you nicely dressed, and\r\nthe carriage will be at the door in half an hour."\r\n\r\nElsie bounded away to do his bidding, her face radiant with happiness;\r\nand at the specified time came down again, looking so very lovely that\r\nher father gazed at her with proud delight, and could not refrain from\r\ngiving her a kiss as he lifted her up to place her in the carriage.\r\n\r\nThen, seating himself beside her, he took her hand in his; and, closing\r\nthe door with the other, bade the coachman drive on.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have never been to Ion, Elsie?" he said, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"No, sir; but I have heard Aunt Adelaide say she thought it a very\r\npretty place," replied the little girl.\r\n\r\n"So it is--almost as pretty as Roselands," said her father. "Travilla\r\nand I have known each other from boyhood, and I spent many a happy day\r\nat Ion, and we had many a boyish frolic together, before I ever thought\r\nof you."\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and patted her cheek as he spoke.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s eyes sparkled. "O papa!" she said eagerly; "won\'t you tell me\r\nabout those times? It seems so strange that you were ever a little boy\r\nand I was nowhere."\r\n\r\nHe laughed. Then said, musingly, "It seems but a very little while to\r\nme, Elsie, since I was no older than you are now."\r\n\r\nHe heaved a sigh, and relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nElsie wished very much that he would grant her request, but did not\r\ndare to disturb him by speaking a word; and they rode on quietly for\r\nsome time, until a squirrel darting up a tree caught her eye, and she\r\nuttered an exclamation. "O papa! did you see that squirrel? look at him\r\nnow, perched up on that branch. There, we have passed the tree, and now\r\nhe is out of sight."\r\n\r\nThis reminded Mr. Dinsmore of a day he had spent in those woods hunting\r\nsquirrels, when quite a boy, and he gave Elsie an animated account of\r\nit. One of the incidents of the day had been the accidental discharge\r\nof the fowling-piece of one of his young companions, close at Horace\r\nDinsmore\'s side, missing him by but a hair\'s breadth.\r\n\r\n"I felt faint and sick when I knew how near I had been to death," he\r\nsaid, as he finished his narrative.\r\n\r\nElsie had been listening with breathless interest.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," she murmured, laying her little cheek against his hand,\r\n"how good God was to spare your life! If you had been killed I could\r\nnever have had you for my papa."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you might have had a much better one, Elsie," he said gravely.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, papa, I wouldn\'t want any other," she replied earnestly,\r\npressing his hand to her lips.\r\n\r\n"Ah! here we are," exclaimed her father, as at that instant the\r\ncarriage turned into a broad avenue, up which they drove quite rapidly,\r\nand the next moment they had stopped, the coachman had thrown open the\r\ncarriage door, and Mr. Dinsmore, springing out, lifted his little girl\r\nin his arms and set her down on the steps of the veranda.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Dinsmore, how do you do? Glad to see you, and my little friend\r\nElsie, too. Why this is really kind," cried Mr. Travilla, in his\r\ncheerful, hearty way, as, hurrying out to welcome them, he shook Mr.\r\nDinsmore cordially by the hand, and kissed Elsie\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"Walk in, walk in," he continued, leading the way into the house, "my\r\nmother will be delighted to see you both; Miss Elsie especially, for\r\nshe seems to have taken a very great fancy to her."\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Travilla\'s greeting was less boisterous, it certainly was not\r\nlacking in cordiality, and she made Elsie feel at home at once; taking\r\noff her bonnet, smoothing her hair, and kissing her affectionately.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen soon went out together, and Elsie spent the morning in\r\nMrs. Travilla\'s room, chatting with her and assisting her with some\r\ncoarse garments she was making for her servants.\r\n\r\nMrs. Travilla was an earnest Christian, and the lady and the little\r\ngirl were not long in discovering the tie which existed between them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Travilla, being also a woman of great discernment, and having\r\nknown Horace Dinsmore nearly all his life, had conceived a very correct\r\nidea of the trials and difficulties of Elsie\'s situation, and without\r\nalluding to them at all, gave her some most excellent advice, which the\r\nlittle girl received very thankfully.\r\n\r\nThey were still chatting together when Mr. Travilla came in, saying,\r\n"Come, Elsie, I want to take you out to see my garden, hot-house, etc.\r\nWe will just have time before dinner. Will you go along, mother?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have some little matters to attend to before dinner, and will\r\nleave you to do the honors," replied the lady; and taking the little\r\ngirl\'s hand he led her out.\r\n\r\n"Where is papa?" asked Elsie.\r\n\r\n"Oh! he\'s in the library, looking over some new books," replied Mr.\r\nTravilla. "He always cared more for books than anything else. But what\r\ndo you think of my flowers?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! they are lovely! What a variety you have! what a splendid\r\ncape-jessamine that is, and there is a variety of cactus I never saw\r\nbefore! Oh! you have a great many more, and handsomer, I think, than we\r\nhave at Roselands," exclaimed Elsie, as she passed admiringly from one\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla was much pleased with the admiration she expressed, for he\r\nwas very fond of his flowers, and took great pride in showing them.\r\n\r\nBut they were soon called in to dinner, where Elsie was seated by her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"I hope this little girl has not given you any trouble, Mrs. Travilla,"\r\nsaid he, looking gravely at her.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no," the lady hastened to say, "I have enjoyed her company very\r\nmuch indeed, and hope you will bring her to see me again very soon."\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, as the day was very warm, they adjourned to the veranda,\r\nwhich was the coolest place to be found; it being on the shady side of\r\nthe house, and also protected by thick trees, underneath which a\r\nbeautiful fountain was playing.\r\n\r\nBut the conversation was upon some subject which did not interest\r\nElsie, and she presently stole away to the library, and seating herself\r\nin a corner of the sofa, was soon lost to everything around her in the\r\nintense interest with which she was reading a book she had taken from\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that is what you are about, Miss Elsie! a bookworm, just like your\r\nfather, I see. I had been wondering what had become of you for the last\r\ntwo hours," exclaimed Mr. Travilla\'s pleasant voice; and sitting down\r\nbeside her, he took the book from her hand, and putting it behind him,\r\nsaid, "Put it away now; you will have time enough to finish it, and I\r\nwant you to talk to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! please let me have it," she pleaded. "I shall not have much time,\r\nfor papa will soon be calling me to go home."\r\n\r\n"No, no, he is not to take you away; I have made a bargain with him to\r\nlet me keep you," said Mr. Travilla, very gravely. "We both think that\r\nthere are children enough at Roselands without you; and so your papa\r\nhas given you to me; and you are to be _my_ little girl, and call _me_\r\npapa in future."\r\n\r\nElsie gazed earnestly in his face for an instant, saying in a\r\nhalf-frightened tone, "You are only joking, Mr. Travilla."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it," said he; "can\'t you see that I\'m in earnest?"\r\n\r\nHis tone and look were both so serious that for an instant Elsie\r\nbelieved he meant all that he was saying, and springing to her feet\r\nwith a little cry of alarm, she hastily withdrew her hand which he had\r\ntaken, and rushing out to the veranda, where her father still sat\r\nconversing with Mrs. Travilla, she flung herself into his arms, and\r\nclinging to him, hid her face on his breast, sobbing, "O papa, _dear_\r\npapa! _don\'t_ give me away; please don\'t--I will be so good--I will do\r\neverything you bid me--I--"\r\n\r\n"Why, Elsie, what does all this mean!" exclaimed Mr. Dinsmore in great\r\nsurprise and perplexity; while Mr. Travilla stood in the doorway\r\nlooking half amused, half sorry for what he had done.\r\n\r\n"O papa!" sobbed the little girl, still clinging to him as though\r\nfearing she should be torn from his arms, "Mr. Travilla says you have\r\ngiven me to him. O papa! _don\'t_ give me away."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! nonsense, Elsie! I am ashamed of you! how can you be so very\r\nsilly as to believe for one moment anything so perfectly absurd as that\r\nI should think of giving you away? Why, I would as soon think of\r\nparting with my eyes."\r\n\r\nElsie raised her head and gazed searchingly into his face; then with a\r\ndeep-drawn sigh of relief, dropped it again, saying, "Oh! I am _so_\r\nglad."\r\n\r\n"Really, Miss Elsie," said Travilla, coming up and patting her on the\r\nshoulder, "I can\'t say that I feel much complimented; and, indeed, I\r\ndon\'t see why you need have been so very much distressed at the\r\nprospect before you; for I must say I have vanity enough to imagine\r\nthat I should make the better--or at least the more indulgent--father\r\nof the two. Come, now, wouldn\'t you be willing to try me for a month,\r\nif your papa will give consent?"\r\n\r\nElsie shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I will let you have your own way in everything," urged Travilla,\r\ncoaxingly; "and I know that is more than he does."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want my own way, Mr. Travilla; I know it wouldn\'t always be a\r\ngood way," replied Elsie, decidedly.\r\n\r\nHer father laughed and passed his hand caressingly over her curls.\r\n\r\n"I thought you liked me, little Elsie," said Travilla, in a tone of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n"So I do, Mr. Travilla; I like you very much," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t you think I would make a good father?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure you would be very kind, and that I should love you very\r\nmuch; but not so much as I love my own papa; because, you know, you are\r\n_not_ my papa, and never can be, even if he _should_ give me to you."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore laughed heartily, saying, "I think you may as well give it\r\nup, Travilla; it seems I\'ll have to keep her whether or no, for she\r\nclings to me like a leech."\r\n\r\n"Well, Elsie, you will at least come to the piano and play a little for\r\nme, will you not?" asked Travilla, smiling.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie still clung to her father, seeming loath to leave him, until\r\nhe said, in his grave, decided way, "Go, Elsie; go at once, and do as\r\nyou are requested."\r\n\r\nThen she rose instantly to obey.\r\n\r\nTravilla looked somewhat vexed. "I wish," he afterward remarked to his\r\nmother, "that Dinsmore was not quite so ready to second my requests\r\nwith his commands. I want Elsie\'s compliance to be voluntary; else I\r\nthink it worth very little."\r\n\r\nElsie played and sang until they were called to tea; after which she\r\nsat quietly by her father\'s side, listening to the conversation of her\r\nelders until the carriage was announced.\r\n\r\n"Well, my daughter," said Mr. Dinsmore, when they were fairly upon\r\ntheir way to Roselands, "have you had a pleasant day?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! _very pleasant_, papa, excepting--" She paused, looking a little\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\n"Well, excepting what?" he asked, smiling down at her.\r\n\r\n"Excepting when Mr. Travilla frightened me so, papa," she replied,\r\nmoving closer to his side, blushing and casting down her eyes.\r\n\r\n"And you do love your own papa best, and don\'t want to exchange him for\r\nanother?" he said, inquiringly, as he passed his arm affectionately\r\naround her waist.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, dear papa, not for anybody else in all the world," she said\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\nHe made no reply in words, but, looking highly gratified, bent down and\r\nkissed her cheek.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak again during their ride, but when the carriage stopped\r\nhe lifted her out, and setting her gently down, bade her a kind\r\ngood-night, saying it was time for mammy to put her to bed.\r\n\r\nShe ran lightly up-stairs, and springing into her nurse\'s arms,\r\nexclaimed, "O mammy, mammy! what a pleasant, _pleasant_ day I have had!\r\nPapa has been so kind, and so were Mr. Travilla and his mother."\r\n\r\n"I\'se _berry_ glad, darlin\', an\' I hope you gwine hab many more such\r\ndays," replied Chloe, embracing her fondly and then proceeding to take\r\noff her bonnet and prepare her for bed, while Elsie gave her a minute\r\naccount of all the occurrences of the day, not omitting the fright Mr.\r\nTravilla had given her, and how happily her fears had been relieved.\r\n\r\n"You look berry happy, my darlin\' pet," said Chloe, clasping her\r\nnursling again in her arms when her task was finished.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mammy, I am happy, oh! _so_ happy, because I do believe that papa\r\nis beginning to love me a little, and I hope that perhaps, after a\r\nwhile, he will love me very much."\r\n\r\nThe tears gathered in her eyes as she spoke.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, as Elsie was returning from her walk, she met her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said he, in a reproving tone, "I have forbidden you to walk\r\nout alone; are you disobeying me?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa," she replied meekly, raising her eyes to his face, "I was\r\nnot alone until about five minutes ago, when Aunt Adelaide and Louise\r\nleft me. They said it did not matter, as I was so near home; and they\r\nwere going to make a call, and did not want me along."\r\n\r\n"Very well," he said, taking hold of her hand and making her walk by\r\nhis side. "How far have you been?"\r\n\r\n"We went down the river bank to the big spring, papa. I believe it is a\r\nlittle more than a mile that way; but when we came home, we made it\r\nshorter by coming across some of the fields and through the meadow."\r\n\r\n"Through the meadow?" said Mr. Dinsmore; "don\'t you go there again,\r\nElsie, unless I give you express permission."\r\n\r\n"Why, papa?" she asked, looking up at him in some surprise.\r\n\r\n"Because I forbid it," he replied sternly; "that is quite enough for\r\nyou to know; all you have to do is to obey, and you need never ask me\r\nwhy, when I give you an order."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s eyes filled, and a big tear rolled quickly down her cheek.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to be naughty, papa," she said, struggling to keep down\r\na sob, "and I will try never to ask why again."\r\n\r\n"There is another thing," said he. "You cry quite too easily; it is\r\nentirely too babyish for a girl of your age; you must quit it."\r\n\r\n"I will try, papa," said the little girl, wiping her eyes, and making a\r\ngreat effort to control her feelings.\r\n\r\nThey had entered the avenue while this conversation was going on, and\r\nwere now drawing near the house; and just at this moment a little girl\r\nabout Elsie\'s age came running to meet them, exclaiming, "O Elsie! I\'m\r\nglad you\'ve come at last. We\'ve been here a whole hour--mamma, and\r\nHerbert, and I--and I\'ve been looking for you all this time."\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Miss Lucy Carrington? I see you can talk as fast as\r\never," said Mr. Dinsmore, laughing, and holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nLucy took it, saying with a little pout, "To be sure, Mr. Dinsmore, it\r\nisn\'t more than two or three weeks since you were at our house, and I\r\nwouldn\'t forget how to talk in that time." Then, looking at Elsie, she\r\nwent on, "We\'ve come to stay a week; won\'t we have a fine time?" and,\r\ncatching her friend round the waist, she gave her a hearty squeeze.\r\n\r\n"I hope so," said Elsie, returning the embrace. "I am glad you have\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"Is your papa here, Miss Lucy?" asked Mr. Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; but he\'s going home again to-night, and then he\'ll come back\r\nfor us next week."\r\n\r\n"I must go in and speak to him," said Mr. Dinsmore. "Elsie, do you\r\nentertain Lucy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I will," said Elsie. "Come with me to my room, won\'t you,\r\nLucy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but won\'t you speak to mamma first? and Herbert, too; you are\r\nsuch a favorite with both of them; and they still are in the\r\ndressing-room, for mamma is not very well, and was quite fatigued with\r\nher ride."\r\n\r\nLucy led the way to her mamma\'s room, as she spoke, Elsie following.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Elsie dear, how do you do? I\'m delighted to see you," said Mrs.\r\nCarrington, rising from the sofa as they entered.\r\n\r\nThen, drawing the little girl closer to her, she passed her arm\r\naffectionately around her waist, and kissed her several times.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are very happy now that your papa has come home at\r\nlast?" she said, looking searchingly into Elsie\'s face. "I remember you\r\nused to be looking forward so to his return; constantly talking of it\r\nand longing for it."\r\n\r\nPoor Elsie, conscious that her father\'s presence had not brought with\r\nit the happiness she had anticipated, and yet unwilling either to\r\nacknowledge that fact or tell an untruth, was at a loss what to say.\r\n\r\nBut she was relieved from the necessity of replying by Herbert, Lucy\'s\r\ntwin brother, a pale, sickly-looking boy, who had for several years\r\nbeen a sufferer from hip complaint.\r\n\r\n"O Elsie!" he exclaimed, catching hold of her hand and squeezing it\r\nbetween both of his, "I\'m ever so glad to see you again."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Carrington, "Herbert always says nobody can tell him\r\nsuch beautiful stories as Elsie; and nobody but his mother and his old\r\nmammy was half so kind to run and wait on him when he was laid on his\r\nback for so many weeks. He missed you very much when we went home, and\r\noften wished he was at Roselands again."\r\n\r\n"How is your hip now, Herbert?" asked Elsie, looking pityingly at the\r\nboy\'s pale face.\r\n\r\n"Oh! a great deal better, thank you. I can take quite long walks\r\nsometimes now, though I still limp, and cannot run and leap like other\r\nboys."\r\n\r\nThey chatted a few moments longer, and then Elsie went to her room to\r\nhave her hat taken off, and her hair made smooth before the tea-bell\r\nshould ring.\r\n\r\nThe two little girls were seated together at the table, Elsie\'s papa\r\nbeing on her other side.\r\n\r\n"How nice these muffins are! Don\'t you like them, Elsie?" asked Lucy,\r\nas she helped herself to a third or fourth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, very much," said Elsie, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Then what are you eating that cold bread for? and you haven\'t got any\r\nbutter, either. Pompey, why don\'t hand Miss Elsie the butter?"\r\n\r\n"No, Lucy, I mustn\'t have it. Papa does not allow me to eat hot cakes\r\nor butter," said Elsie, in the same cheerful tone in which she had\r\nspoken before.\r\n\r\nLucy opened her eyes very wide, and drew in her breath.\r\n\r\n"Well," she exclaimed, "I guess if _my_ papa should try that on me, I\'d\r\nmake such a fuss he\'d _have_ to let me eat just whatever I wanted."\r\n\r\n"Elsie knows better than to do that," said Mr. Dinsmore, who had\r\noverheard the conversation; "she would only get sent away from the\r\ntable and punished for her naughtiness."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t do it anyhow, papa," said Elsie, raising her eyes\r\nbeseechingly to his face.\r\n\r\n"No, daughter, I don\'t believe you would," he replied in an unusually\r\nkind tone, and Elsie\'s face flushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed away very pleasantly, Lucy sharing Elsie\'s studies\r\nin the mornings, while Herbert remained with his mamma; and then in the\r\nafternoon all walking or riding out together, unless the weather was\r\ntoo warm, when they spent the afternoon playing in the veranda, on the\r\nshady side of the house, and took their ride or walk after the sun was\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nArthur and Walter paid but little attention to Herbert, as his lameness\r\nprevented him from sharing in the active sports which they preferred;\r\nfor they had never been taught to yield their wishes to others, and\r\nwere consequently extremely selfish and overbearing; but Elsie was very\r\nkind, and did all in her power to interest and amuse him.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon they all walked out together, attended by Jim; but Arthur\r\nand Walter, unwilling to accommodate their pace to Herbert\'s slow\r\nmovements, were soon far in advance, Jim following close at their heels.\r\n\r\n"They\'re quite out of sight," said Herbert presently, "and I\'m very\r\ntired. Let\'s sit down on this bank, girls; I want to try my new bow,\r\nand you may run and pick up my arrows for me."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," said Lucy, laughing; "Elsie may do it if she likes,\r\nbut as for me, _I_ mean to take a nap; this nice, soft grass will make\r\nan elegant couch;" and throwing herself down, she soon was, or\r\npretended to be, in a sound slumber; while Herbert, seating himself\r\nwith his back against a tree, amused himself with shooting his arrows\r\nhere and there, Elsie running for them and bringing them to him, until\r\nshe was quite heated and out of breath.\r\n\r\n"Now I must rest a little, Herbert," she said at length, sitting down\r\nbeside him. "Shall I tell you a story?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, do; I like your stories, and I don\'t mind leaving off\r\nshooting till you\'re done," said he, laying down his bow.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s story lasted about ten minutes, and when she had finished,\r\nHerbert took up his bow again, saying, "I guess you\'re rested now,\r\nElsie," and sent an arrow over into the meadow.\r\n\r\n"There! just see how far I sent that! do run and bring it to me,\r\nElsie!" he cried, "and let me see if I can\'t hit that tree next time;\r\nI\'ve but just missed it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m tired, Herbert; but I\'ll run and bring it to you this once,"\r\nreplied Elsie, forgetting entirely her father\'s prohibition; "but then\r\nyou must try to wait until Jim comes back before you shoot any more."\r\n\r\nSo saying, she darted away, and came back in a moment with the arrow in\r\nher hand. But a sudden recollection had come over her just as she left\r\nthe meadow, and throwing down the arrow at the boy\'s feet, she\r\nexclaimed in an agitated tone, "O Herbert! I must go home just as\r\nquickly as I can; I had forgotten--oh! how _could_ I forget! oh! what\r\nwill papa say!"\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter?" asked Herbert in alarm.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Elsie, sobbing. "There are the boys coming; they\r\nwill take care of you, and I must go home. Good-bye."\r\n\r\nAnd she ran quickly up the road, Herbert following her retreating form\r\nwith wondering eyes.\r\n\r\nElsie sped onward, crying bitterly as she went.\r\n\r\n"Where is papa!" she inquired of a servant whom she met in the avenue.\r\n\r\n"Dunno, Miss Elsie, but I reckon Massa Horace am in de house, kase his\r\nhorse am in de stable."\r\n\r\nElsie hardly waited for the answer, but hurrying into the house, went\r\nfrom room to room, looking and asking in vain for her father. He was\r\nnot in the drawing-room, or the library, or his own apartments. She had\r\njust come out of this, and meeting a chamber-maid in the hall, she\r\nexclaimed, "O Fanny! where _is_ papa? can\'t you tell me? for I must see\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Here I am, Elsie; what do you want with me?" called out her father\'s\r\nvoice from the veranda, where she had neglected to look.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" he repeated, as his little girl appeared before him\r\nwith her flushed and tearful face. Elsie moved slowly toward him, with\r\na timid air and downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to tell you something, papa," she said in a low, tremulous\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"Well, I am listening," said he, taking hold of her hand and drawing\r\nher to his side. "What is it? are you sick or hurt?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, not either; but--but, O papa! I have been a very naughty\r\ngirl," she exclaimed, bursting into tears, and sobbing violently. "I\r\ndisobeyed you, papa. I--I have been in the meadow."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible! Would you _dare_ to do so when I so positively forbade\r\nit only the other day?" he said in his sternest tone, while a dark\r\nfrown gathered on his brow. "Elsie, I shall have to punish you."\r\n\r\n"I did not intend to disobey you, papa," she sobbed; "I quite forgot\r\nthat you had forbidden me to go there."\r\n\r\n"That is no excuse, no excuse at all," said he severely; "You must\r\n_remember_ my commands; and if your memory is so poor I shall find\r\nmeans to strengthen it."\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, still looking sternly at the little, trembling,\r\nsobbing girl at his side; then asked, "What were you doing in the\r\nmeadow? tell me the whole story, that I may understand just how\r\nseverely I ought to punish you."\r\n\r\nElsie gave him all the particulars; and when, upon questioning her\r\nclosely, he perceived how entirely voluntary her confession had been,\r\nhis tone and manner became less stern, and he said quite mildly, "Well,\r\nElsie, I shall not be very severe with you this time, as you seem to be\r\nvery penitent, and have made so full and frank a confession; but beware\r\nhow you disobey me again, for you will not escape so easily another\r\ntime; and remember I will not take forgetfulness as any excuse. Go now\r\nto Aunt Chloe, and tell her from me that she is to put you immediately\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\n"It is only the middle of the afternoon, papa," said Elsie,\r\ndeprecatingly.\r\n\r\n"If it were much _earlier_, Elsie, it would make no difference; you\r\nmust go at once to your bed, and stay there until to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"What will Lucy and Herbert think when they come in and can\'t find me,\r\npapa?" she said, weeping afresh.\r\n\r\n"You should have thought of that before you disobeyed me," he answered\r\nvery gravely. "If you are hungry," he added, "you may ask Chloe to get\r\nyou a slice of bread or a cracker for your supper, but you can have\r\nnothing else."\r\n\r\nElsie lingered, looking timidly up into his face as though wanting to\r\nsay something, but afraid to venture.\r\n\r\n"Speak, Elsie, if you have anything more to say," he said encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, I am _so_ sorry I have been so naughty," she murmured,\r\nleaning her head against the arm of his chair, while the tears rolled\r\nfast down her cheeks; "won\'t you please forgive me, papa? it seems to\r\nme I can\'t go to sleep to-night if you are angry with me."\r\n\r\nHe seemed quite touched by her penitence. "Yes, Elsie," he said, "I do\r\nforgive you. I am not at all angry with you now, and you may go to\r\nsleep in peace. Good night, my little daughter," and he bent down and\r\npressed his lips to her brow.\r\n\r\nElsie held up her face for another, and he kissed her lips.\r\n\r\n"Good night, dear papa," she said, "I hope I shall never be such a\r\nnaughty girl again." And she went to her room, made almost happy by\r\nthat kiss of forgiveness.\r\n\r\nElsie was up quite early the next morning and had learned all her\r\nlessons before breakfast. As she came down the stairs she saw, through\r\nthe open door, her papa standing with some of the men-servants,\r\napparently gazing at some object lying on the ground. She ran out and\r\nstood on the steps of the portico, looking at them and wondering what\r\nthey were doing.\r\n\r\nPresently her father turned round, and seeing her, held out his hand,\r\ncalling, "Come here, Elsie."\r\n\r\nShe sprang quickly down the steps, and running to him, put her hand in\r\nhis, saying, "Good morning, papa."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, daughter," said he, "I have something to show you."\r\n\r\nAnd leading her forward a few paces, he pointed to a large rattlesnake\r\nlying there.\r\n\r\n"O papa!" she cried, starting back and clinging to him.\r\n\r\n"It will not hurt you _now_" he said; "it is dead; the men killed it\r\nthis morning _in the meadow_. Do you see _now_ why I forbade you to go\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"O papa!" she murmured, in a low tone of deep feeling, laying her cheek\r\naffectionately against his hand, "I might have lost my life by my\r\ndisobedience. How good God was to take care of me! Oh! I hope I shall\r\nnever be so naughty again."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said he gravely, but not unkindly; "and I hope that you\r\nwill always, after this, believe that your father has some good reason\r\nfor his commands, even although he may not choose to explain it to you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I think I will," she answered, humbly.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast-bell had rung, and he now led her in and seated her at\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nLucy Carrington looked curiously at her, and soon took an opportunity\r\nto whisper, "Where were you last night, Elsie? I couldn\'t find you, and\r\nyour papa wouldn\'t say what had become of you, though I am quite sure\r\nhe knew."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you after breakfast," replied Elsie, blushing deeply.\r\n\r\nLucy waited rather impatiently until all had risen from the table, and\r\nthen, putting her arm round Elsie\'s waist, she drew her out on to the\r\nveranda, saying, "now, Elsie, tell me; you know you promised."\r\n\r\n"I was in bed," replied Elsie, dropping her eyes, while the color\r\nmounted to her very hair.\r\n\r\n"In bed! before five o\'clock!" exclaimed Lucy in a tone of\r\nastonishment. "Why, what was that for?"\r\n\r\n"Papa sent me," replied Elsie, with an effort. "I had been naughty, and\r\ndisobeyed him."\r\n\r\n"Why, how strange! Do tell me what you had done!" exclaimed Lucy, with\r\na face full of curiosity.\r\n\r\n"Papa had forbidden me to go into the meadow, I forgot all about it,\r\nand ran in there to get Herbert\'s arrow for him," replied Elsie,\r\nlooking very much ashamed.\r\n\r\n"Was _that all?_ why _my_ papa wouldn\'t have punished me for that,"\r\nsaid Lucy. "He might have scolded me a little if I had done it on\r\npurpose, but if I had told him I had forgotten, he would only have\r\nsaid, \'You must remember better next time.\'"\r\n\r\n"Papa says that forgetfulness is no excuse; that I am to remember his\r\ncommands, and if I forget, he will have to punish me, to make me\r\nremember better next time," said Elsie.\r\n\r\n"He must be very strict indeed; I\'m glad he is not _my_ papa," replied\r\nLucy, in a tone of great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Come, little girls, make haste and get ready; we are to start in half\r\nan hour," said Adelaide Dinsmore, calling to them from the hall door.\r\n\r\nThe whole family, old and young, including visitors, were on that day\r\nto go on a picnic up the river, taking their dinner along, and spending\r\nthe day in the woods. They had been planning this excursion for several\r\ndays, and the children especially had been looking forward to it with a\r\ngreat deal of pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Am I to go, Aunt Adelaide? did papa say so?" asked Elsie anxiously, as\r\nshe and Lucy hastened to obey the summons.\r\n\r\n"I presume you are to go of course, Elsie; we have been discussing the\r\nmatter for the last three days, always taking it for granted that you\r\nwere to make one of the party, and he has never said you should not,"\r\nreplied Adelaide, good-naturedly; "so make haste, or you will be too\r\nlate. But here comes your papa now." she added, as the library door\r\nopened, and Mr. Dinsmore stepped out into the hall where they were\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n"Horace, Elsie is to go of course?"\r\n\r\n"I do not see the _of course_, Adelaide," said he dryly. "No; Elsie is\r\n_not_ to go; she must stay at home and attend to her lessons as usual."\r\n\r\nA look of keen disappointment came over Elsie\'s face, but she turned\r\naway without a word and went upstairs; while Lucy, casting a look of\r\nwrathful indignation at Mr. Dinsmore, ran after her, and following her\r\ninto her room, she put her arm round her neck, saying, "Never mind,\r\nElsie; it\'s too bad, and I wouldn\'t bear it. I\'d go in spite of him."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Lucy, I must obey my father; God says so; and besides, I\r\ncouldn\'t do that if I wanted to, for papa is stronger than I am, and\r\nwould punish me severely if I were to attempt such a thing," replied\r\nElsie hastily, brushing away a tear that _would_ come into her eye.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'d coax him," said Lucy. "Come, I\'ll go with you, and we will\r\nboth try."\r\n\r\n"No," replied Elsie, with a hopeless shake of the head, "I have found\r\nout already that my papa never breaks his word; and nothing could\r\ninduce him to let me go, now that he has once said I should not. But\r\nyou will have to leave me, Lucy, or you will be too late."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, then," said Lucy, turning to go; "but I think it is a great\r\nshame, and I shan\'t half enjoy myself without you."\r\n\r\n"Well now, Horace, I think you might let the child go," was Adelaide\'s\r\nsomewhat indignant rejoinder to her brother, as the two little girls\r\ndisappeared; "I can\'t conceive what reason you can have for keeping her\r\nat home, and she looks so terribly disappointed. Indeed, Horace, I am\r\nsometimes half inclined to think you take pleasure in thwarting that\r\nchild."\r\n\r\n"You had better call me a tyrant at once, Adelaide," said he angrily,\r\nand turning very red; "but I must beg to be permitted to manage my own\r\nchild in my own way; and I cannot see that I am under any obligation to\r\ngive my reasons either to you or to any one else."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you did not intend to let her go, I think you might have said\r\nso at first, and not left the poor child to build her hopes upon it,\r\nonly to be disappointed. I must say I think it was cruel."\r\n\r\n"Until this morning, Adelaide," he replied, "I did intend to let her\r\ngo, for I expected to go myself; but I find I shall not be able to do\r\nso, as I must meet a gentleman on business; and as I know that\r\naccidents frequently occur to such pleasure parties, I don\'t feel\r\nwilling to let Elsie go, unless I could be there myself to take care of\r\nher. Whether you believe it or not, it is really regard for my child\'s\r\nsafety, and _not_ cruelty, that leads me to refuse her this\r\ngratification."\r\n\r\n"You are full of notions about that child, Horace," said Adelaide, a\r\nlittle impatiently. "I\'m sure some of the rest of us could take care of\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"No; in case of accident you would all have enough to do to take care\r\nof yourselves, and I shall not think of trusting Elsie in the company,\r\nsince I cannot be there myself," he answered decidedly; and Adelaide,\r\nseeing he was not to be moved from his determination, gave up the\r\nattempt, and left the room to prepare for her ride.\r\n\r\nIt was a great disappointment to Elsie, and for a few moments her heart\r\nrose up in rebellion against her father. She tried to put away the\r\nfeeling, but it would come back; for she could not imagine any reason\r\nfor his refusal to let her go, excepting the disobedience of the day\r\nbefore, and it seemed hard and unjust to punish her twice for the same\r\nfault, especially as he would have known nothing about it but for her\r\nown frank and voluntary confession. It was a great pity she had not\r\nheard the reasons he gave her Aunt Adelaide, for then she would have\r\nbeen quite submissive and content. It is indeed true that she ought to\r\nhave been as it was; but our little Elsie, though sincerely desirous to\r\ndo right, was not yet perfect, and had already strangely forgotten the\r\nlesson of the morning.\r\n\r\nShe watched from the veranda the departure of the pleasure-seekers, all\r\napparently in the gayest spirits. She was surprised to see that her\r\nfather was not with them, and it half reconciled her to staying at\r\nhome, although she hardly expected to see much of him; but there was\r\nsomething pleasant in the thought that he wanted her at home because he\r\nwas to be there himself; it looked as though he really had some\r\naffection for her, and even a selfish love was better than none. I do\r\nnot mean that these were Elsie\'s thoughts; no, she never would have\r\ndreamed of calling her father selfish; but the undefined feeling was\r\nthere, as she watched him hand the ladies into the carriage, and then\r\nturn and reenter the house as they drove off.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Day\'s bell rang, and Elsie gathered up her books and hastened\r\nto the school-room. Her patience and endurance were sorely tried that\r\nmorning, for Miss Day was in an exceedingly bad humor, being greatly\r\nmortified and also highly indignant that she had not been invited to\r\nmake one of the picnic party; and Elsie had never found her more\r\nunreasonable and difficult to please; and her incessant fault-finding\r\nand scolding were almost more than the little girl could bear in\r\naddition to her own sad disappointment. But at last the morning, which\r\nhad seldom seemed so long, was over, and Elsie dismissed from the\r\nschool-room for the day.\r\n\r\nAt dinner, instead of the usual large party, there were only her father\r\nand the gentleman with whom he was transacting business, Miss Day, and\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was not one of those who care to notice children, but\r\ncontinued to discuss business and politics with Mr. Dinsmore, without\r\nseeming to be in the least aware of the presence of the little girl,\r\nwho sat in perfect silence, eating whatever her father saw fit to put\r\nupon her plate; and Elsie was very glad indeed when at length Miss Day\r\nrose to leave the table, and her papa told her she might go too.\r\n\r\nHe called her back though, before she had gone across the room, to say\r\nthat he had intended to ride with her that afternoon, but found he\r\nshould not be able to do so, and she must take Jim for a protector, as\r\nhe did not wish her either to miss her ride or to go entirely alone.\r\n\r\nHe spoke very kindly; Elsie thought with remorse of the rebellious\r\nfeelings of the morning, and, had she been alone with her father, would\r\ncertainly have confessed them, expressing her sorrow and asking\r\nforgiveness; but she could not do so before a third person, more\r\nespecially a stranger; and merely saying, "Yes, papa, I will," she\r\nturned away and left the room. Jim was bringing up her horse as she\r\npassed the open door; and she hastened up-stairs to prepare for her\r\nride.\r\n\r\n"O mammy!" she suddenly exclaimed, as Chloe was trying on her hat, "is\r\nPomp going to the city to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, darlin\', he gwine start directly," said Chloe, arranging her\r\nnursling\'s curls to better advantage, and finishing her work with a\r\nfond caress.\r\n\r\n"Oh! then, mammy, take some money out of my purse, and tell him to buy\r\nme a pound of the very nicest candy he can find," said the little girl,\r\neagerly. "I haven\'t had any for a long time, and I feel hungry for it\r\nto-day. What they had bought for the picnic looked so good, but you\r\nknow I didn\'t get any of it."\r\n\r\nThe picnic party returned just before tea-time, and Lucy Carrington\r\nrushed into Elsie\'s room eager to tell her what a delightful day they\r\nhad had. She gave a very glowing account of their sports and\r\nentertainment, interrupting herself every now and then to lament over\r\nElsie\'s absence, assuring her again and again that it had been the only\r\ndrawback upon her own pleasure, and that she thought that Elsie\'s papa\r\nwas very unkind indeed to refuse her permission to go. As Elsie\r\nlistened the morning\'s feelings of vexation and disappointment returned\r\nin full force; and though she said nothing, she allowed her friend to\r\naccuse her father of cruelty and injustice without offering any\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their talk the tea-bell rang, and they hurried down to\r\ntake their places at the table, where Lucy went on with her narrative,\r\nthough in a rather subdued tone, Elsie now and then asking a question,\r\nuntil Mr. Dinsmore turned to his daughter, saying, in his stern way,\r\n"Be quiet, Elsie; you are talking entirely too much for a child of your\r\nage; don\'t let me hear you speak again until you have left the table."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face flushed, and her eyes fell, under the rebuke; and during\r\nthe rest of the meal not a sound escaped her lips.\r\n\r\n"Come, Elsie, let us go into the garden and finish our talk," said\r\nLucy, putting her arm affectionately around her friend\'s waist as they\r\nleft the table; "your papa can\'t hear us there, and we\'ll have a good\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Papa only stopped us because we were talking too much at the table,"\r\nsaid Elsie, apologetically; "I\'m sure he is willing you should tell me\r\nall about what a nice time you all had. But, Lucy," she added, lowering\r\nher voice, "please don\'t say again that you think papa was unkind to\r\nkeep me at home to-day. I\'m sure he knows best, and I ought not to have\r\nlistened to a word of that kind about him."\r\n\r\n"O! well, never mind, I won\'t talk so any more," said Lucy,\r\ngood-naturedly, as they skipped down the walk together; "but I do think\r\nhe\'s cross, and I wish you were my sister, that you might have my kind,\r\ngood papa for yours too," she added, drawing her arm more closely about\r\nher friend\'s waist.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Lucy," said Elsie, with a little sigh, "I would like to be\r\nyour sister, but indeed I would not like to give up my own dear papa,\r\nfor I love him, oh! _so_ much."\r\n\r\n"Why, how funny, when he\'s so cross to you!" exclaimed Lucy, laughing.\r\n\r\nElsie put her hand over her friend\'s mouth, and Lucy pushed it away,\r\nsaying, "Excuse me; I forgot; but I\'ll try not to say it again."\r\n\r\nWhile the little girls were enjoying their talk in the garden, a\r\nservant with a small bundle in her hand came out on the veranda, where\r\nMr. Horace Dinsmore was sitting smoking a cigar, and, casting an\r\ninquiring glance around, asked if he knew where Miss Elsie was?\r\n\r\n"What do you want with her?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Only to give her dis bundle, massa, dat Pomp jus brought from de city."\r\n\r\n"Give it to me," he said, extending his hand to receive it.\r\n\r\nA few moments afterward Elsie and her friend returned to the house, and\r\nmeeting Pomp, she asked him if he had brought her candy.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he had got some that was very nice indeed, and he\r\nthought that Fanny had carried it to her; and seeing Fanny near, he\r\ncalled to her to know what she had done with it.\r\n\r\n"Why, Pomp, Massa Horace he told me to give it to him," said the girl.\r\n\r\nElsie turned away with a very disappointed look.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll go and ask him for it, won\'t you?" asked Lucy, who was anxious\r\nto enjoy a share of the candy as well as to see Elsie gratified.\r\n\r\n"No," said Elsie, sighing, "I had rather do without it."\r\n\r\nLucy coaxed for a little while, but finding it impossible to persuade\r\nElsie to approach her father on the subject, finally volunteered to do\r\nthe errand herself.\r\n\r\nElsie readily consented, and Lucy, trembling a little in spite of her\r\nboast that she was not afraid of him, walked out on to the veranda\r\nwhere Mr. Dinsmore was still sitting, and putting on an air of great\r\nconfidence, said:\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dinsmore, will you please to give me Elsie\'s candy? she wants it."\r\n\r\n"Did Elsie send you?" he asked in a cold, grave tone.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied Lucy, somewhat frightened.\r\n\r\n"Then, if you please, Miss Lucy, you may tell Elsie to come directly to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nLucy ran back to her friend, and Elsie received the message in some\r\ntrepidation, but as no choice was now left her, she went immediately to\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n"Did you want me, papa?" she asked timidly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Elsie; I wish to know why you send another person to me for what\r\nyou want, instead of coming yourself. It displeases me very much, and\r\nyou may rest assured that you will never get anything that you ask for\r\nin that way."\r\n\r\nElsie hung her head in silence.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to answer me?" he asked, in his severe tone. "Why did\r\nyou send Lucy instead of coming yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I was afraid, papa," she whispered, almost under her breath.\r\n\r\n"Afraid! afraid of what?" he asked, with increasing displeasure.\r\n\r\n"Of you, papa," she replied, in a tone so low that he could scarcely\r\ncatch the words, although he bent down his ear to receive her reply.\r\n\r\n"If I were a drunken brute, in the habit of knocking you about, beating\r\nand abusing you, there might be some reason for your fear, Elsie," he\r\nsaid, coloring with anger; "but, as it is, I see no excuse for it at\r\nall and I am both hurt and displeased by it."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry, papa; I won\'t do so again," she said, tremblingly.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s pause, and then she asked in a timid hesitating\r\nway, "Papa, may I have my candy, if you please?"\r\n\r\n"No, you may not," he said decidedly; "and understand and remember that\r\nI positively forbid you either to buy or eat anything of the kind again\r\nwithout my express permission."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s eyes filled, and she had a hard struggle to keep down a rising\r\nsob as she turned away and went slowly back to the place where she had\r\nleft her friend.\r\n\r\n"Have you got it?" asked Lucy, eagerly.\r\n\r\nElsie shook her head.\r\n\r\n"What a shame!" exclaimed Lucy, indignantly. "He\'s just as cross as he\r\ncan be. He\'s a tyrant, so he is! just a hateful old tyrant, and I\r\nwouldn\'t care a cent for him, if I were you, Elsie. I\'m glad he is not\r\nmy father, so I am."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he doesn\'t love me much," sighed Elsie in low, tearful\r\ntones, "for he hardly ever lets me have anything, or go anywhere that I\r\nwant to."\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind, _I\'ll_ send and buy a good lot tomorrow, and we\'ll\r\nhave a regular feast," said Lucy, soothingly, as she passed her arm\r\naround her friend\'s waist and drew her down to a seat on the portico\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Lucy; you can buy for yourself if you like, but not for me,\r\nfor papa has forbidden me to eat anything of the sort."\r\n\r\n"Oh! of course we\'ll not let him know anything about it," said Lucy.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie shook her head sadly, saying with a little sigh, "No, Lucy,\r\nyou are very kind, but I cannot disobey papa, even if he should never\r\nknow it, because that would be disobeying God, and He would know it."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, how particular you are!" exclaimed Lucy a little pettishly.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said Mr. Dinsmore, speaking from the door, "what are you doing\r\nthere? Did I not forbid you to be out in the evening air?"\r\n\r\n"I did not know you meant the doorstep, papa. I thought I was only not\r\nto go down into the garden," replied the little girl, rising to go in.\r\n\r\n"I see you intend to make as near an approach to disobedience as you\r\ndare," said her father. "Go immediately to your room, and tell mammy to\r\nput you to bed."\r\n\r\nElsie silently obeyed, and Lucy, casting an indignant glance at Mr.\r\nDinsmore, was about to follow her, when he said, "I wish her to go\r\nalone, if you please, Miss Lucy;" and with a frown and a pout the\r\nlittle girl walked into the drawing-room and seated herself on the sofa\r\nbeside her mamma.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore walked out on to the portico, and stood there watching the\r\nmoon which was just rising over the treetops.\r\n\r\n"Horace," said Arthur, emerging from the shadow of a tree near by and\r\napproaching his brother, "Elsie thinks you\'re a tyrant. She says you\r\nnever let her have anything, or go anywhere, and you\'re always\r\npunishing her. She and Lucy have had a fine time out here talking over\r\nyour bad treatment of her, and planning to have some candy in spite of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Arthur, I do not believe that Elsie would deliberately plan to disobey\r\nme; and whatever faults she may have, I am very sure she is above the\r\nmeanness of telling tales," replied Mr. Dinsmore, in a tone of\r\nseverity, as he turned and went into the house, while Arthur, looking\r\nsadly crestfallen, crept away out of sight.\r\n\r\nWhen Elsie reached her room, she found that Chloe was not there; for,\r\nnot expecting that her services would be required at so early an hour,\r\nshe had gone down to the kitchen to have a little chat with her\r\nfellow-servants. Elsie rang for her, and then walking to the window,\r\nstood looking down into the garden in an attitude of thoughtfulness and\r\ndejection. She was mentally taking a review of the manner in which she\r\nhad spent the day, as was her custom before retiring. The retrospect\r\nhad seldom been so painful to the little girl. She had a very tender\r\nconscience, and it told her now that she had more than once during the\r\nday indulged in wrong feelings toward her father; that she had also\r\nallowed another to speak disrespectfully of him, giving by her silence\r\na tacit approval of the sentiments uttered, and, more than that, had\r\nspoken complainingly of him herself.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she murmured half aloud as she covered her face with her hands,\r\nand the tears trickled through her fingers, "how soon I have forgotten\r\nthe lesson papa taught me this morning, and my promise to trust him\r\nwithout knowing his reasons. I don\'t deserve that he should love me or\r\nbe kind and indulgent, when I am so rebellious."\r\n\r\n"What\'s de matter, darlin\'?" asked Chloe\'s voice in pitiful tones, as\r\nshe took her nursling in her arms and laid her little head against her\r\nbosom, passing her hand caressingly over the soft bright curls; "your\r\nole mammy can\'t bear to see her pet cryin\' like dat."\r\n\r\n"O mammy, mammy! I\'ve been such a wicked girl to-day! Oh! I\'m afraid I\r\nshall never be good, never be like Jesus. I\'m afraid He is angry with\r\nme, for I have disobeyed Him to-day," sobbed the child.\r\n\r\n"Darlin\'," said Chloe, earnestly, "didn\'t you read to your ole mammy\r\ndis very morning dese bressed words: \'If any man sin, we have an\r\nadvocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\' an\' de other:\r\n\'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our\r\nsins.\' Go to de dear, bressed Lord Jesus, darlin\', an\' ax Him to\r\nforgive you, an\' I _knows_ He will."\r\n\r\n"Yes, He will," replied the little girl, raising her head and dashing\r\naway her tears, "He will forgive my sins, and take away my wicked\r\nheart, and give me right thoughts and feelings. How glad I am you\r\nremembered those sweet texts, you dear old mammy," she added, twining\r\nher arms lovingly around her nurse\'s neck. And then she delivered her\r\npapa\'s message, and Chloe began at once to prepare her for bed.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s tears had ceased to flow, but they were still trembling in her\r\neyes, and the little face wore a very sad and troubled expression as\r\nshe stood patiently passive in her nurse\'s hands. Chloe had soon\r\nfinished her labors, and then the little girl opened her Bible, and, as\r\nusual, read a few verses aloud, though her voice trembled, and once or\r\ntwice a tear fell on the page; then closing the book she stole away to\r\nthe side of the bed and knelt down.\r\n\r\nShe was a good while on her knees, and several times, as the sound of a\r\nlow sob fell upon Chloe\'s ear, she sighed and murmured to herself:\r\n"Poor, darlin\'! dear, bressed lamb, your ole mammy don\'t like to hear\r\ndat."\r\n\r\nThen as the child rose from her kneeling posture she went to her, and\r\ntaking her in her arms, folded her in a fond embrace, calling her by\r\nthe most tender and endearing epithets, and telling her that her old\r\nmammy loved her better than life--better than anything in the wide\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nElsie flung her arms around her nurse\'s neck, and laid her head upon\r\nher bosom, saying, "Yes, my dear old mammy, I know you love me, and I\r\nlove you, too. But put me in bed now, or papa will be displeased."\r\n\r\n"What makes you so onrestless, darlin\'?" asked Chloe, half an hour\r\nafterward; "can\'t you go to sleep no how?"\r\n\r\n"O mammy! if I could only see papa just for one moment to tell him\r\nsomething. Do you think he would come to me?" sighed the little girl.\r\n"Please, mammy, go down and see if he is busy. Don\'t say a word if he\r\nis; but if not, ask him to come to me for just one minute."\r\n\r\nChloe left the room immediately, but returned the next moment, saying,\r\n"I jes looked into de parlor, darlin\', an\' Mass Horace he mighty busy\r\nplayin\' chess wid Miss Lucy\'s mamma, an\' I didn\'t say nuffin\' to him.\r\nJes you go sleep, my pet, an\' tell Mass Horace all \'bout it in de\r\nmornin\'."\r\n\r\nElsie sighed deeply, and turning over on her pillow, cried herself to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nChloe was just putting the finishing touches to the little girl\'s dress\r\nthe next morning, when Lucy Carrington rapped at the door.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Elsie," she said; "I was in a hurry to come to you,\r\nbecause it is my last day, you know. Wasn\'t it too bad of your father\r\nto send you off to bed so early last night?"\r\n\r\n"No, Lucy, papa has a right to send me to bed whenever he pleases; and\r\nbesides, I was naughty and deserved to be punished; and it was not much\r\nmore than half an hour earlier than my usual bedtime."\r\n\r\n"You naughty!" exclaimed Lucy, opening her eyes very wide. "Mamma often\r\nsays she wishes I was half as good."\r\n\r\nElsie sighed, but made no answer. Her thoughts seemed far away. She was\r\nthinking of what she had been so anxious, the night before, to say to\r\nher father, and trying to gain courage to do it this morning. "If I\r\ncould only get close to him when nobody was by, and he would look and\r\nspeak kindly to me, I could do it then," she murmured to herself.\r\n\r\n"Come, Aunt Chloe, aren\'t you done? I want to have a run in the garden\r\nbefore breakfast," said Lucy, somewhat impatiently, as Chloe tied and\r\nuntied Elsie\'s sash several times.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss Lucy, I\'se done now," she answered, passing her hand once\r\nmore over her nursling\'s curls: "but Mass Horace he mighty pertickler\r\n\'bout Miss Elsie."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Elsie, "papa wants me always to look very nice and neat;\r\nand when I go down in the morning he just gives me one glance from head\r\nto foot, and if anything is wrong he is sure to see it and send me back\r\nimmediately to have it made right. Now, mammy, please give me my hat\r\nand let us go."\r\n\r\n"You\'s got plenty ob time, chillens; de bell won\'t go for to ring dis\r\nhour," remarked the old nurse, tying on Elsie\'s hat.\r\n\r\n"My chile looks sweet an\' fresh as a moss rosebud dis mornin\'," she\r\nadded, talking to herself, as she watched the two little girls tripping\r\ndown-stairs hand in hand.\r\n\r\nThey skipped up and down the avenue several times, and ran all round\r\nthe garden before it was time to go in. Then Elsie went up to Chloe to\r\nhave her hair made smooth again. She was just descending for the second\r\ntime to the hall, where she had left Lucy, when they saw a carriage\r\ndrive up to the front door.\r\n\r\n"There\'s papa!" cried Lucy, joyfully, as it stopped and a gentleman\r\nsprang out and came up the steps into the portico; and in an instant\r\nshe was in his arms, receiving such kisses and caresses as Elsie had\r\nvainly longed for all her life.\r\n\r\nLucy had several brothers, but was an only daughter, and a very great\r\npet, especially with her father.\r\n\r\nElsie watched them with a wistful look and a strange aching at her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut presently Mr. Carrington set Lucy down and turning to her, gave her\r\na shake of the hand, and then a kiss, saying, "How do you do this\r\nmorning, my dear? I\'m afraid you are hardly glad to see me, as I come\r\nto take Lucy away, for I suppose you have been having fine times\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, indeed we have; and I hope you will let her come again."\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, certainly; but the visits must not be all on one side. I\r\nshall talk to your papa about it, and perhaps persuade him to let us\r\ntake you along this afternoon to spend a week at Ashlands."\r\n\r\n"Oh! how delightful!" cried Lucy, clapping her hands. "Elsie, do you\r\nthink he will let you go?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I\'m afraid not," replied the little girl doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"You must coax him, as I do my papa," said Lucy.\r\n\r\nBut at this Elsie only shook her head, and just then the breakfast-bell\r\nrang.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore was already in the breakfast-room, and Elsie, going up to\r\nhim, said, "Good morning, papa."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Elsie," he replied, but his tone was so cold that even\r\nif no one else had been by, she could not have said another word.\r\n\r\nHe had not intended to be influenced by the information Arthur had so\r\nmaliciously given him the night before; yet unconsciously he was, and\r\nhis manner to his little daughter was many degrees colder than it had\r\nbeen for some time.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Lucy reminded Elsie of a promise she had made to show\r\nher some beautiful shells which her father had collected in his\r\ntravels, and Elsie led the way to the cabinet, a small room opening\r\ninto the library, and filled with curiosities.\r\n\r\nThey had gone in alone, but were soon followed by Arthur, Walter and\r\nEnna.\r\n\r\nAlmost everything in the room belonged to Mr. Horace Dinsmore; and\r\nElsie, knowing that many of the articles were rare and costly, and that\r\nhe was very careful of them, begged Enna and the boys to go out, lest\r\nthey should accidentally do some mischief.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t," replied Arthur. "I\'ve just as good a right to be here as\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he gave her a push, which almost knocked her over, and in\r\ncatching at a table to save herself from falling, she threw down a\r\nbeautiful vase of rare old china, which Mr. Dinsmore prized very\r\nhighly. It fell with a loud crash, and lay scattered in fragments at\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\n"There, see what you\'ve done!" exclaimed Arthur, as the little group\r\nstood aghast at the mischief.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Mr. Dinsmore was just then in the library, and the\r\nnoise soon brought him upon the scene of action.\r\n\r\n"Who did this?" he asked, in a wrathful tone, looking from one to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said Arthur; "she threw it down and broke it."\r\n\r\n"Troublesome, careless child! I would not have taken a hundred dollars\r\nfor that vase," he exclaimed. "Go to your room! go this instant, and\r\nstay there until I send for you; and remember, if you ever come in here\r\nagain without permission I shall punish you."\r\n\r\nHe opened the door as he spoke, and Elsie flew across the hall, up the\r\nstairs, and into her own room, without once pausing or looking back.\r\n\r\n"Now go out, every one of you, and don\'t come in here again; this is no\r\nplace for children," said Mr. Dinsmore, turning the others into the\r\nhall, and shutting and locking the door upon them.\r\n\r\n"You ought to be ashamed, Arthur Dinsmore," exclaimed Lucy indignantly;\r\n"it was all your own fault, and Elsie was not to blame at all, and you\r\nknow it."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t touch the old vase, and I\'m not going to take the blame of\r\nit, either, I can tell you, miss," replied Arthur, moving off, followed\r\nby Walter and Enna, while Lucy walked to the other end of the hall, and\r\nstood looking out of the window, debating in her own mind whether she\r\nhad sufficient courage to face Mr. Dinsmore, and make him understand\r\nwhere the blame of the accident ought to lie.\r\n\r\nAt length she seemed to have solved the question; for turning about and\r\nmoving noiselessly down the passage to the library door, she gave a\r\ntimid little rap, which was immediately answered by Mr. Dinsmore\'s\r\nvoice saying, "Come in."\r\n\r\nLucy opened the door and walked in, closing it after her.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore sat at a table writing, and he looked up with an\r\nexpression of mingled surprise and impatience.\r\n\r\n"What do you want, Miss Lucy?" he said, "speak quickly, for I am very\r\nbusy."\r\n\r\n"I just wanted to tell you, sir," replied Lucy, speaking up quite\r\nboldly, "that Elsie was not at all to blame about the vase; for it was\r\nArthur who pushed her and made her fall against the table, and that was\r\nthe way the vase came to fall and break."\r\n\r\n"What made him push her?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Just because Elsie asked him, and Walter, and Enna to go out, for fear\r\nthey might do some mischief."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore\'s pen was suspended over the paper for a moment, while he\r\nsat thinking with a somewhat clouded brow; but presently turning to the\r\nlittle girl, he said quite pleasantly, "Very well, Miss Lucy, I am much\r\nobliged to you for your information, for I should be very sorry to\r\npunish Elsie unjustly. And now will you do me the favor to go to her\r\nand tell her that her papa says she need not stay in her room any\r\nlonger?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I will," replied Lucy, her face sparkling with delight as\r\nshe hurried off with great alacrity to do his bidding.\r\n\r\nShe found Elsie in her room crying violently, and throwing her arms\r\naround her neck she delivered Mr. Dinsmore\'s message, concluding with,\r\n"So now, Elsie, you see you needn\'t cry, nor feel sorry any more; but\r\njust dry your eyes and let us go down into the garden and have a good\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nElsie was very thankful to Lucy, and very glad that her papa now knew\r\nthat she was not to blame; but she was still sorry for his loss, and\r\nhis words had wounded her too deeply to be immediately forgotten;\r\nindeed it was some time before the sore spot they had made in her heart\r\nwas entirely healed. But she tried to forget it all and enter heartily\r\ninto the sports proposed by Lucy.\r\n\r\nThe Carringtons were not to leave until the afternoon, and the little\r\ngirls spent nearly the whole morning in the garden, coming into the\r\ndrawing-room a few moments before the dinner-bell rang.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrington sat on a sofa engaged with some fancy work, while\r\nHerbert, who had not felt well enough to join the other children, had\r\nstretched himself out beside her, putting his head in her lap.\r\n\r\nMr. Carrington and Mr. Horace Dinsmore were conversing near by.\r\n\r\nLucy ran up to her papa and seated herself upon his knee with her arm\r\naround his neck; while Elsie stopped a moment to speak to Herbert, and\r\nthen timidly approaching her father, with her eyes upon the floor, said\r\nin a low, half-frightened tone, that reached no ear but his, "I am very\r\nsorry about the vase, papa."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and drawing her close to him, pushed back the hair\r\nfrom her forehead with his other hand, and bending down to her, said\r\nalmost in a whisper, "Never mind, daughter, we will forget all about\r\nit. I am sorry I spoke so harshly to you, since Lucy tells me you were\r\nnot so much to blame."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face flushed with pleasure, and she looked up gratefully; but\r\nbefore she had time to reply, Mrs. Carrington said, "Elsie, we want to\r\ntake you home with us to spend a week; will you go?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to, very much, indeed, ma\'am, if papa will let me,"\r\nreplied the little girl, looking wistfully up into his face.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Dinsmore, what do you say? I hope you can have no\r\nobjection," said Mrs. Carrington, looking inquiringly at him; while her\r\nhusband added, "Oh! yes, Dinsmore, you must let her go by all means;\r\nyou can certainly spare her for a week, and it need be no interruption\r\nto her lessons, as she can share with Lucy in the instructions of our\r\ngoverness, who is really a superior teacher."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore was looking very grave, and Elsie knew from the expression\r\nof his countenance what his answer would be, before he spoke. He had\r\nnoticed the indignant glance Lucy had once or twice bestowed upon him,\r\nand remembering Arthur\'s report of the conversation between the two\r\nlittle girls the night before, had decided in his own mind that the\r\nless Elsie saw of Lucy the better.\r\n\r\n"I thank you both for your kind attention to my little girl," he\r\nreplied courteously, "but while fully appreciating your kindness in\r\nextending the invitation, I must beg leave to decline it, as I am\r\nsatisfied that home is the best place for her at present."\r\n\r\n"Ah! no, I suppose we ought hardly to have expected you to spare her so\r\nsoon after your return," said Mrs. Carrington; "but, really, I am very\r\nsorry to be refused, for Elsie is such a good child that I am always\r\ndelighted to have Lucy and Herbert with her."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you think better of her than she deserves, Mrs. Carrington. I\r\nfind that Elsie is sometimes naughty and in need of correction, as well\r\nas other children, and therefore, I think it best to keep her as much\r\nas possible under my own eye," replied Mr. Dinsmore, looking very\r\ngravely at his little daughter as he spoke.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face flushed painfully, and she had hard work to keep from\r\nbursting into tears. It was a great relief to her that just at that\r\nmoment the dinner-bell rang, and there was a general movement in the\r\ndirection of the dining-room. Her look was touchingly humble as her\r\nfather led her in and seated her at the table.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking, "Papa says I am naughty sometimes, but oh! how _very_\r\nnaughty he would think me if he knew all the wicked feelings I had\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had risen from the table, Mrs. Carrington bade Lucy go\r\nup to her maid to have her bonnet put on, as the carriage was already\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\nElsie would have gone with her, but her father had taken her hand\r\nagain, and he held it fast.\r\n\r\nShe looked up inquiringly into his face.\r\n\r\n"Stay here," he said. "Lucy will be down again in a moment."\r\n\r\nAnd Elsie stood quietly at his side until Lucy returned.\r\n\r\nBut even then her father did not relinquish his hold of her hand, and\r\nall the talking the little girls could do must be done close at his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nYet, as he was engaged in earnest conversation with Mr. Carrington, and\r\ndid not seem to be listening to them, Lucy ventured to whisper to\r\nElsie, "I think it\'s real mean of him; he might let you go."\r\n\r\n"No," replied Elsie, in the same low tone, "I\'m sure papa knows best;\r\nand besides, I _have_ been naughty, and don\'t deserve to go, though I\r\nshould like to, dearly."\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye," said Lucy, giving her a kiss.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Mr. Carrington\'s carriage was fairly on its way down\r\nthe avenue, that Mr. Dinsmore dropped his little girl\'s hand; and then\r\nhe said, "I want you in the library, Elsie; come to me in half an hour."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I will," she replied, looking a little frightened.\r\n\r\n"You need not be afraid," he said, in a tone of displeasure; "I am not\r\ngoing to hurt you."\r\n\r\nElsie blushed and hung her head, but made no reply, and he turned away\r\nand left her. She could not help wondering what he wanted with her, and\r\nthough she tried not to feel afraid, it was impossible to keep from\r\ntrembling a little as she knocked at the library door.\r\n\r\nHer father\'s voice said, "Come in," and entering, she found him alone,\r\nseated at a table covered with papers and writing materials, while\r\nbeside the account book in which he was writing lay a pile of money, in\r\nbank notes, and gold and silver.\r\n\r\n"Here, Elsie," he said, laying down his pen, "I want to give you your\r\nmonth\'s allowance. Your grandfather has paid it to you heretofore, but\r\nof course, now that I am at home, I attend to everything that concerns\r\nyou. You have been receiving eight dollars--I shall give you ten," and\r\nhe counted out the money and laid it before her as he spoke; "but I\r\nshall require a strict account of all that you spend. I want you to\r\nlearn to keep accounts, for if you live, you will some day have a great\r\ndeal of money to take care of; and here is a blank book that I have\r\nprepared, so that you can do so very easily. Every time that you lay\r\nout or give away any money, you must set it down here as soon as you\r\ncome home; be particular about that, lest you should forget something,\r\nbecause you must bring your book to me at the end of every month, and\r\nlet me see how much you have spent, and what is the balance in hand;\r\nand if you are not able to make it come out square, and tell me what\r\nyou have done with every penny, you will lose either the whole or a\r\npart of your allowance for the next month, according to the extent of\r\nyour delinquency. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Let me see now how much you can remember of your last\r\nmonth\'s expenditures. Take the book and set down everything you can\r\nthink of."\r\n\r\nElsie had a good memory, and was able to remember how she had spent\r\nalmost every cent during the time specified; and she set down one item\r\nafter another, and then added up the column without any mistake.\r\n\r\n"That was very well done," said her father approvingly. And then\r\nrunning over the items half aloud, "Candy, half a dollar; remember,\r\nElsie, there is to be no more money disposed of in that way; not as a\r\nmatter of economy, by any means, but because I consider is very\r\ninjurious. I am very anxious that you should grow up strong and\r\nhealthy. I would not for anything have you a miserable dyspeptic."\r\n\r\nThen suddenly closing the book and handing it to her, he said,\r\ninquiringly, "You were very anxious to go to Ashlands?"\r\n\r\n"I would have liked to go, papa, if you had been willing," she replied\r\nmeekly.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid Lucy is not a suitable companion for you, Elsie. I think\r\nshe puts bad notions into your head," he said very gravely.\r\n\r\nElsie flushed and trembled, and was just opening her lips to make her\r\nconfession, when the door opened and her grandfather entered. She could\r\nnot speak before him, and so remained silent.\r\n\r\n"Does she not sometimes say naughty things to you?" asked her father,\r\nspeaking so low that her grandfather could not have heard.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied the little girl, almost under her breath.\r\n\r\n"I thought so," said he, "and therefore I shall keep you apart as\r\nentirely as possible; and I hope there will be no murmuring on your\r\npart."\r\n\r\n"No, papa, you know best," she answered, very humbly.\r\n\r\nThen, putting the money into her hands, he dismissed her. When she had\r\ngone out he sat for a moment in deep thought. Elsie\'s list of articles\r\nbought with her last month\'s allowance consisted almost entirely of\r\ngifts for others, generally the servants. There were some beads and\r\nsewing-silk for making a purse, and a few drawing materials; but with\r\nthe exception of the candy, she had bought nothing else for herself.\r\nThis was what her father was thinking of.\r\n\r\n"She is a dear, unselfish, generous little thing," he said to himself.\r\n"However, I may be mistaken; I must not allow myself to judge from only\r\none month. She seems submissive, too,"--he had overheard what passed\r\nbetween her and Lucy at parting--"but perhaps that was for effect; she\r\nprobably suspected I could hear her--and she thinks me a tyrant, and\r\nobeys from fear, not love."\r\n\r\nThis thought drove away all the tender feeling that had been creeping\r\ninto his heart; and when he next met his little daughter, his manner\r\nwas as cold and distant as ever, and Elsie found it impossible to\r\napproach him with sufficient freedom to tell him what was in her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice\r\n    Triumphs."\r\n                                 --LONGFELLOW\'S _Evangeline_.\r\n\r\n                      "How disappointment tracks\r\n    The steps of hope!"\r\n                                 --MISS LANDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, the next week after the Carringtons had left, the\r\nyounger members of the family, Arthur, Elsie, Walter and Enna, were\r\nsetting out to take a walk, when Elsie, seeing a gold chain depending\r\nfrom the pocket of Arthur\'s jacket, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"O Arthur! how _could_ you take grandpa\'s watch? _Do_ put it away, for\r\nyou will be almost sure to injure it."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, Elsie; I\'ll do as I please," was the polite\r\nrejoinder.\r\n\r\n"But, Arthur, you _know_ that grandpa would never let you take it. I\r\nhave often heard him say that it was very valuable, for it was seldom\r\nthat so good a one could be had at any price; and I know that he paid a\r\ngreat deal for it."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he prizes it so, he needn\'t have left it lying on his table,\r\nand so I\'ll just teach him a lesson; it\'s about time he learnt to be\r\ncareful."\r\n\r\n"O Arthur! do put it away," pleaded Elsie, "if anything should happen\r\nto it, what will grandpa say? I know he will be very angry, and ask us\r\nall who did it; and you know I cannot tell a lie, and if he asks me if\r\nit was you, I cannot say no."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll trust you for telling tales," replied Arthur, sneeringly;\r\n"but if you do, I\'ll pay you for it."\r\n\r\nHe ran down the avenue as he spoke, Walter and Enna following, and\r\nElsie slowly bringing up the rear, looking the picture of distress, for\r\nshe knew not what to do, seeing that Arthur would not listen to her\r\nremonstrances, and, as often happened, all the older members of the\r\nfamily were out, and thus there was no authority that could be appealed\r\nto in time to prevent the mischief which she had every reason to fear\r\nwould be done. Once she thought of turning back, that she might escape\r\nthe necessity of being a witness in the case; but, remembering that her\r\nfather told her she must walk with the others that afternoon, and also\r\nthat, as she had already seen the watch in Arthur\'s possession, her\r\ntestimony would be sufficient to convict him even if she saw no more,\r\nshe gave up the idea, and hurried on, with the faint hope that she\r\nmight be able to induce Arthur to refrain from indulging in such sports\r\nas would be likely to endanger the watch; or else to give it into her\r\ncharge. At any other time she would have trembled at the thought of\r\ntouching it; but now she felt so sure it would be safer with her than\r\nwith him, that she would gladly have taken the responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe walk was far from being a pleasure that afternoon; the boys ran so\r\nfast that it quite put her out of breath to keep up with them; and then\r\nevery little while Arthur would cut some caper that made her tremble\r\nfor the watch; answering her entreaties that he would either give it\r\ninto her care or walk along quietly, with sneers and taunts, and\r\ndeclarations of his determination to do just exactly as he pleased, and\r\nnot be ruled by her.\r\n\r\nBut at length, while he was in the act of climbing a tree, the watch\r\ndropped from his pocket and fell to the ground, striking with\r\nconsiderable force.\r\n\r\nElsie uttered a scream, and Arthur, now thoroughly frightened himself,\r\njumped down and picked it up.\r\n\r\nThe crystal was broken, the back dented, and how much the works were\r\ninjured they could not tell; but it had ceased to run.\r\n\r\n"O Arthur! see what you\'ve done!" exclaimed Walter.\r\n\r\n"What will papa say?" said Enna; while Elsie stood pale and trembling,\r\nnot speaking a word.\r\n\r\n"You hush!" exclaimed Arthur fiercely. "I\'ll tell you what, if any of\r\nyou dare to tell of me, I\'ll make you sorry for it to the last day of\r\nyour life. Do you hear?"\r\n\r\nThe question was addressed to Elsie in a tone of defiance.\r\n\r\n"Arthur," said she, "grandpa will know that _somebody_ did it, and\r\nsurely you would not wish an innocent person to be punished for _your_\r\nfault."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care _who_ gets punished, so that papa does not find out that\r\nI did it," said he furiously; "and if you dare to tell of me, I\'ll pay\r\nyou for it."\r\n\r\n"I shall say nothing, unless it becomes necessary to save the innocent,\r\nor I am forced to speak; but in that case I shall tell the truth,"\r\nreplied Elsie, firmly.\r\n\r\nArthur doubled up his fist, and made a plunge at her as if he meant to\r\nknock her down; but Elsie sprang behind the tree, and then ran so\r\nfleetly toward the house that he was not able to overtake her until his\r\npassion had had time to cool.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the house, Arthur replaced the watch on his father\'s\r\ntable, whence he had taken it, and then they all awaited his return\r\nwith what courage they might.\r\n\r\n"I say, Wally," said Arthur, drawing his little brother aside and\r\nspeaking in a low tone, having first sent a cautious glance around to\r\nassure himself that no one else was within hearing; "I say, what would\r\nyou give me for that new riding whip of mine?"\r\n\r\n"O Arthur! anything I\'ve got," exclaimed the little boy eagerly. "But\r\nyou wouldn\'t give it up, I know, and you\'re only trying to tease me."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Wal; I mean to _give_ it to you if you\'ll only be a good\r\nfellow and do as I tell you."\r\n\r\n"What?" he asked, with intense interest.\r\n\r\n"Tell papa that Jim broke the watch."\r\n\r\n"But he _didn\'t_" replied the child, opening his eyes wide with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"Well, what of that, you little goose?" exclaimed Arthur impatiently;\r\n"papa doesn\'t know that."\r\n\r\n"But Jim will get punished," said Walter, "and I don\'t want to tell\r\nsuch a big story either."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir, then you\'ll not get the whip; and, besides, if you\r\ndon\'t do as I wish, I\'m certain you\'ll see a ghost one of these nights;\r\nfor there\'s one comes to see me sometimes, and I\'ll send him right off\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! _don\'t_, Arthur, don\'t; I\'d die of fright," cried the little boy,\r\nwho was very timid, glancing nervously around, as if he expected the\r\nghost to appear immediately.\r\n\r\n"I tell you I will, though, if you don\'t do as I say; he\'ll come this\r\nvery night and carry you off, and never bring you back."\r\n\r\n"O Arthur! don\'t let him come, and I\'ll say anything you want me to,"\r\ncried the little fellow in great terror.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good boy; I knew you would," said Arthur, smiling\r\ntriumphantly. And turning away from Walter, he next sought out Enna,\r\nand tried his threats and persuasions upon her with even better success.\r\n\r\nElsie had gone directly to her own room, where she sat trembling every\r\ntime a footstep approached her door, lest it should be a messenger from\r\nher grandfather. No one came, however, and at last the tea-bell rang,\r\nand on going down she found to her relief that her grandfather and his\r\nwife had not yet returned.\r\n\r\n"You look pale, Elsie," said her father, giving her a scrutinizing\r\nglance as she took her seat by his side. "Are you well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, quite well," she replied.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her again a little anxiously, but said no more; and as\r\nsoon as the meal was concluded, Elsie hastened away to her own room\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was still early in the evening when Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore\r\nreturned--for once, bringing no company with them; and he had not been\r\nmany minutes in the house ere he took up his watch, and of course\r\ninstantly discovered the injury it had sustained.\r\n\r\nHis suspicions at once fell upon Arthur, whose character for mischief\r\nwas well established; and burning with rage, watch in hand, he repaired\r\nto the drawing-room, which he entered, asking, in tones tremulous with\r\npassion, "Where is Arthur! Young rascal! this is some of _his_ work,"\r\nhe added, holding up the injured article.\r\n\r\n"My dear, how can you say so? have you any proof?" asked his wife,\r\ndeprecatingly adding in her softest tones, "my poor boy seems to get\r\nthe blame of everything that goes wrong."\r\n\r\n"He gets no more than he deserves," replied her husband angrily.\r\n"Arthur! Arthur, I say, where are you?"\r\n\r\n"He is in the garden, sir, I think. I saw him walking in the shrubbery\r\na moment since," said Mr. Horace Dinsmore.\r\n\r\nThe father instantly despatched a servant to bring him in; sending a\r\nsecond in search of the overseer; while a third was ordered to assemble\r\nall the house-servants. "I will sift this matter to the bottom, and\r\nchild or servant, the guilty one shall suffer for it," exclaimed the\r\nold gentleman, pacing angrily up and down the room. "Arthur," said he\r\nsternly, as the boy made his appearance, looking somewhat pale and\r\nalarmed, "how dared you meddle with my watch?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t, sir; I never touched it," he replied boldly, yet avoiding\r\nhis father\'s eye as he uttered the deliberate falsehood.\r\n\r\n"There, my dear, I told you so," exclaimed his mother, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe you," said his father; "and if you are guilty, as I\r\nstrongly suspect, you had better confess it at once, before I find it\r\nout in some other way."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t do it, sir. It was Jim, and I can prove it by Walter and\r\nEnna; we all saw it fall from his pocket when he was up in a tree; and\r\nhe cried like anything when he found it was broken, and said he didn\'t\r\nmean to do it any harm; he was only going to wear it a little while,\r\nand then put it back all safe; but now master would be dreadfully\r\nangry, and have him flogged."\r\n\r\n"That I will, if it is true," exclaimed the old gentleman,\r\npassionately; "he shall be well whipped and sent out to work on the\r\nplantation. I\'ll keep no such meddlers about my house."\r\n\r\nHe looked at Enna. "What do you know of this?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It is true, papa, I saw him do it," she replied, with a slight blush,\r\nand sending an uneasy glance around the room.\r\n\r\n"Did you see it, too, Walter?" asked his father.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied the little fellow, in a low, reluctant tone; "but\r\nplease, papa, don\'t punish him. I\'m sure he didn\'t mean to break it."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue! he _shall_ be punished as he deserves," cried the\r\nold gentleman, furiously. "Here, sir," turning to the overseer, and\r\npointing to Jim, "take the fellow out, and give him such a flogging as\r\nhe will remember."\r\n\r\nElsie was sitting in her own room, trying to learn a lesson for the\r\nnext day, but finding great difficulty in fixing her thoughts upon it,\r\nwhen she was startled by the sudden entrance of Aunt Chloe, who, with\r\nher apron to her eyes, was sobbing violently.\r\n\r\n"O mammy, mammy! what\'s the matter? has anything happened to you?"\r\ninquired the little girl, in a tone of great alarm, starting to her\r\nfeet, and dropping her book in her haste and fright.\r\n\r\n"Why," sobbed Chloe, "Jim, he\'s been an\' gone an\' broke ole master\'s\r\nwatch, an\' he\'s gwine be whipped, an\' old Aunt Phoebe she\'s cryin\' fit\r\nto break her ole heart \'bout her boy, kase--"\r\n\r\nElsie waited to hear no more, but darting out into the hall, and\r\nencountering her father on his way to his room, she rushed up to him,\r\npale and agitated, and seizing his hand, looked up eagerly into his\r\nface, exclaiming with a burst of tears and sobs, "O papa, papa! don\'t,\r\noh! _don\'t_ let them whip poor Jim."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore\'s countenance was very grave, almost distressed.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry it is necessary, daughter," he said, "but Jim has done very\r\nwrong, and deserves his punishment, and I cannot interfere."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, papa, he did not, _indeed_ he did not break the watch. I\r\n_know_ he didn\'t, for I was by and saw it all."\r\n\r\n"Is it _possible?_" said he, in a tone of surprise; "then tell me who\r\ndid do it. It could not have been you, Elsie?" and he looked\r\nsearchingly into her face.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, papa, I would never have dared to touch it. But please don\'t\r\nmake me tell tales; but I know it wasn\'t Jim. Oh! _do_ stop them\r\nquickly, before they begin to whip him."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Chloe," said Mr. Dinsmore, "go down to my father, and tell him it\r\nis my request that the punishment should be delayed a few moments until\r\nI come down."\r\n\r\nThen taking Elsie\'s hand, he led her into her room again, and seating\r\nhimself, drew her to his side, saying, with grave decision, "Now, my\r\ndaughter, if you want to save Jim, it will be necessary for you to tell\r\n_all_ you know about this affair."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to tell tales, papa," pleaded the little girl; "I think\r\nit so very mean. Is it not enough for me to tell that I know Jim didn\'t\r\ndo it?"\r\n\r\n"No, Elsie; I have already said that it is _quite necessary_ for you to\r\ntell _all you know_."\r\n\r\n"O papa! don\'t make me; I don\'t like to do it," she urged, with tears\r\nin her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I should be very much ashamed of you, and quite unwilling to own you\r\nas my child, if under any other circumstances you were willing to tell\r\ntales," he replied, in a tone of kindness that quite surprised Elsie,\r\nwho always trembled at the very thought of opposing the slightest\r\nresistance to his will; "but," he added, firmly, "it is the only way to\r\nsave Jim; if you do not now make a full disclosure of all you know, he\r\nwill be severely whipped and sent away to work on the plantation, which\r\nwill distress his poor old mother exceedingly. Elsie, I think you would\r\nbe doing very wickedly to allow an innocent person to suffer when you\r\ncan prevent it; and besides, I will add the weight of my authority, and\r\nsay you _must do it at once_; and you well know, my daughter, that\r\nthere can be no question as to the duty of obedience to your father."\r\n\r\nHe paused, gazing earnestly down into the little tearful, downcast,\r\nblushing face at his side.\r\n\r\n"Have I not said enough to convince you of your duty?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; I will tell you all about it," she answered in a tremulous\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nHer story was told with evident reluctance, but in a simple,\r\nstraightforward manner, that attested its truthfulness.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore listened in silence, but with an expression of indignation\r\non his handsome features; and the moment she had finished he rose, and\r\nagain taking her hand, led her from the room, saying, as he did so:\r\n\r\n"You must repeat this story to your grandfather."\r\n\r\n"O papa! must I? Won\'t you tell him? please don\'t make me do it," she\r\npleaded tremblingly, and hanging back.\r\n\r\n"My daughter, you _must_," he replied, so sternly that she dared not\r\nmake any further resistance, but quietly submitted to be led into her\r\ngrandfather\'s presence.\r\n\r\nHe was still in the drawing-room, walking about in a disturbed and\r\nangry manner, and now and then casting a suspicious glance upon Arthur,\r\nwho sat pale and trembling in a corner, looking the picture of guilt\r\nand misery; for he had heard Chloe deliver his brother\'s message, and\r\nfeared that exposure awaited him.\r\n\r\nWalter had stolen away to cry over Jim\'s punishment, and wish that he\r\nhad had the courage to tell the truth at first; but saying to himself\r\nthat it was too late now, his father wouldn\'t believe him, and he would\r\nmake it up to Jim somehow, even if it took all his pocket-money for a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nNone of the other members of the family had left the room, and all wore\r\nan anxious, expectant look, as Mr. Dinsmore entered, leading Elsie by\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n"I have brought you another witness, sir," he said, "for it seems Elsie\r\nwas present when the mischief was done."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" exclaimed the old gentlemen; "then I may hope to get at the\r\ntruth. Elsie, who broke my watch?"\r\n\r\n"It was not Jim, grandpa, indeed, _indeed_, it was not; but oh!\r\n_please_ don\'t make me say who it was," replied the little girl,\r\nbeseechingly.\r\n\r\n"Elsie!" exclaimed her father, in a tone of stern reproof.\r\n\r\n"O papa! how can I?" she sobbed, trembling and clinging to his hand as\r\nshe caught a threatening look from Arthur.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, child, you must tell us all you know about it," said her\r\ngrandfather, "or else I can\'t let Jim off."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore was looking down at his little girl, and, following the\r\ndirection of her glance, perceived the cause of her terror. "Don\'t be\r\nafraid to speak out and tell all you know, daughter, for I will protect\r\nyou," he said, pressing the little trembling hand in his, and at the\r\nsame time giving Arthur a meaning look.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, speak out, child; speak out at once; no one shall hurt you\r\nfor telling the truth," exclaimed her grandfather, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I will, grandpa," she said, trembling and weeping; "but please don\'t\r\nbe very angry with Arthur; if you will forgive him this time, I think\r\nhe will never meddle any more; and I am quite sure he did not mean to\r\nbreak it."\r\n\r\n"So it _was you_, after all, you young rascal! I knew it from the\r\nfirst!" cried the old gentleman, striding across the room, seizing the\r\nboy by the shoulder and shaking him roughly.\r\n\r\n"But go on, Elsie, let us have the whole story," he added, turning to\r\nher again, but still keeping his hold upon Arthur. "You young dog!" he\r\nadded, when she had finished. "Yes, I\'ll forgive you when you\'ve had a\r\ngood, sound flogging, and a week\'s solitary confinement on bread and\r\nwater, but not before."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he was about to lead him from the room, when Elsie suddenly\r\nsprang forward, and with clasped hands, and flushed, eager face, she\r\npleaded earnestly, beseechingly, "O grandpa! don\'t whip him, don\'t\r\npunish him! He will never be so naughty again. Will you, Arthur? Let\r\n_me pay_ for the watch, grandpa, and don\'t punish him. I would so like\r\nto do it."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t the moneyed value of the watch I care for, child," replied\r\nthe old gentleman, contemptuously; "and besides, where would you get so\r\nmuch money?"\r\n\r\n"I am rich, grandpa, am I not? Didn\'t my mamma leave me a great deal of\r\nmoney?" asked the little girl, casting down her eyes and blushing\r\npainfully.\r\n\r\n"No, Elsie," said her father, very gently, as he took her hand and led\r\nher back to the side of his chair again, "you have nothing but what I\r\nchoose to give you, until you come of age, which will not be for a\r\ngreat many years yet."\r\n\r\n"But you _will_ give me the money to pay for the watch papa, _won\'t_\r\nyou?" she asked, pleadingly.\r\n\r\n"No, I certainly shall not, for I think Arthur should be left to suffer\r\nthe penalty of his own misdeeds," he replied in a very decided tone;\r\n"and, besides," he added, "your grandfather has already told you that\r\nit is not the pecuniary loss he cares for."\r\n\r\n"No; but I will teach this young rascal to let my property alone," said\r\nthe elder gentleman with almost fierce determination, as he tightened\r\nhis grasp upon the boy\'s arm and dragged him from the room.\r\n\r\nArthur cast a look of hatred and defiance at Elsie as he went out, that\r\nmade her grow pale with fear and tremble so that she could scarcely\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nHer father saw both the look and its effect, and drawing the little\r\ntrembler closer to him, he put his arm around her, and stroking her\r\nhair, said in a low, soothing tone: "Don\'t be frightened, daughter; I\r\nwill protect you."\r\n\r\nShe answered him with a grateful look and a long sigh of relief, and he\r\nwas just about to take her on his knee when visitors were announced,\r\nand, changing his mind, he dismissed her to her room, and she saw no\r\nmore of him that evening.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if they only _hadn\'t_ come just now," thought the sorely\r\ndisappointed child, as she went out with slow, reluctant steps. "I\'m\r\nsure they wouldn\'t, if they had only known. I\'m sure, quite sure papa\r\nwas going to take me on his knee, and they prevented him. Oh! will be\r\never think of doing it again! Dear, dear papa, if you could only know\r\nhow I long to sit there!" But Mrs. Dinsmore, who had hastily retired on\r\nthe exit of Arthur and his father from the drawing-room, was now\r\nsailing majestically down the hall, on her return thither; and Elsie,\r\ncatching sight of her, and being naturally anxious to avoid a meeting\r\njust then, at once quickened her pace very considerably, almost running\r\nup the stairs to her own room, where she found old Aunt Phoebe, Jim\'s\r\nmother, waiting to speak with her.\r\n\r\nThe poor old creature was overflowing with gratitude, and her fervent\r\noutpouring of thanks and blessings almost made Elsie forget her\r\ndisappointment for the time.\r\n\r\nThen Jim came to the door, asking to see Miss Elsie, and poured out his\r\nthanks amid many sobs and tears; for the poor fellow had been terribly\r\nfrightened--indeed, so astounded by the unexpected charge, that he had\r\nnot had a word to say in his own defence, beyond an earnest and\r\nreiterated assertion of his entire innocence; to which, however, his\r\nangry master had paid no attention.\r\n\r\nBut at length Phoebe remembered that she had some baking to do, and\r\ncalling on Jim to come right along and split up some dry wood to heat\r\nher oven, she went down to the kitchen followed by her son, and Elsie\r\nwas left alone with her nurse.\r\n\r\nChloe sat silently knitting, and the little girl, with her head leaning\r\nupon her hand and her eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the floor, was\r\nrehearsing again and again in her own mind all that had just passed\r\nbetween her papa and herself; dwelling with lingering delight upon\r\neverything approaching to a caress, every kind word, every soothing\r\ntone of his voice; and then picturing to herself all that he might have\r\ndone and said if those unwelcome visitors had not come in and put an\r\nend to the interview; and half hoping that he would send for her when\r\nthey had gone, she watched the clock and listened intently for every\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nBut her bedtime came and she dared not stay up any longer; for his\r\norders had been peremptory that she should always retire precisely at\r\nthat hour, unless she had his express permission to remain up longer.\r\n\r\nShe lay awake for some time, thinking of his unwonted kindness, and\r\nindulging fond hopes for the future, then fell asleep to dream that she\r\nwas on her father\'s knee, and felt his arms folded lovingly about her,\r\nand his kisses warm upon her cheek.\r\n\r\nHer heart beat quickly as she entered the breakfast-room the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe family were just taking their places at the table, and her\r\nhalf-eager, half-timid "Good morning, papa," was answered by a grave,\r\nabsent "Good morning, Elsie," and turning to his father and entering\r\ninto a conversation with him on some business matter, he took no\r\nfurther notice of his little daughter, excepting to see that her plate\r\nwas well supplied with such articles of food as he allowed her to eat.\r\n\r\nElsie was sadly disappointed, and lingered about the room in the vain\r\nhope of obtaining a smile or caress; but presently her father went out,\r\nsaying to the elder Mr. Dinsmore that he was going to ride over to Ion,\r\nand would probably not return before night; then, with a sigh, the\r\nlittle girl went back to her own room to prepare her morning lessons.\r\n\r\nElsie was now happily free from Arthur\'s persecutions for a time; for\r\neven after his release, he was too much afraid of his brother openly to\r\noffer her any very serious annoyance, though he plotted revenge in\r\nsecret; yet the little girl\'s situation was far from comfortable, and\r\nher patience often severely tried, for Mrs. Dinsmore was excessively\r\nangry with her on Arthur\'s account, and whenever her father was not\r\npresent, treated her in the most unkind manner; and from the same cause\r\nthe rest of the family, with the exception of her grandpa and Aunt\r\nAdelaide, were unusually cold and distant; while her father, although\r\ncareful to see that all her wants were attended to, seldom took any\r\nfurther notice of her; unless to reprove her for some childish fault\r\nwhich, however trifling, never escaped his eye.\r\n\r\n"You seem," said Adelaide to him one day, as he sent Elsie from the\r\nroom for some very slight fault, "to expect that child to be a great\r\ndeal more perfect than any grown person I ever saw, and to understand\r\nall about the rules of etiquette."\r\n\r\n"If you please, Adelaide," said he haughtily, "I should like to be\r\nallowed to manage my own child as I see proper, without any\r\ninterference from others."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," replied his sister; "I had no intention of interfering;\r\nbut really, Horace, I do think you have no idea how eagle-eyed you are\r\nfor faults in her, nor how _very_ stern is the tone in which you always\r\nreprove her. I have known Elsie a great deal longer than you have, and\r\nI feel very certain that a gentle reproof would do her quite as much\r\ngood, and not wound her half so much."\r\n\r\n"Enough, Adelaide!" exclaimed her brother, impatiently. "If I were ten\r\nyears _younger_ than yourself, instead of that much older, there might\r\nbe some propriety in your advising and directing me thus; as it is, I\r\nmust say I consider it simply impertinent." And he left the room with\r\nan angry stride, while Adelaide looked after him with the thought, "I\r\nam glad you have no authority over me."\r\n\r\nAll that Adelaide had said was true; yet Elsie never complained, never\r\nblamed her father, even in her heart; but, in her deep humility,\r\nthought it was all because she was "so very naughty or careless;" and\r\nshe was continually making resolutions to be "oh! _so_ careful always\r\nto do just right, and please dear papa, so that some day he might learn\r\nto love her."\r\n\r\nBut, alas! that hope was daily growing fainter and fainter; his cold\r\nand distant manner to her and his often repeated reproofs had so\r\nincreased her natural timidity and sensitiveness that she was now very\r\nconstrained in her approaches to him, and seldom ventured to move or\r\nspeak in his presence; and he would not see that this timidity and\r\nembarrassment were the natural results of his treatment, but attributed\r\nit all to want of affection. He saw that she feared him, and to that\r\nfeeling alone he gave credit for her uniform obedience to his commands,\r\nwhile he had no conception of the intense, but now almost despairing\r\nlove for him that burned in that little heart, and made the young life\r\none longing, earnest desire and effort to gain his affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTH\r\n\r\n   "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of\r\n    death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and\r\n    thy staff, they comfort me."\r\n                                 --_Psalm_ xxiii. 4.\r\n\r\n   "\'Tis but the cruel artifice of fate,\r\n    Thus to refine and vary on our woes,\r\n    To raise us from despair and give us hopes,\r\n    Only to plunge us in the gulf again,\r\n    And make us doubly wretched."\r\n                                 --TRAP\'s _Abramuh_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sabbath morning, and Elsie, ready dressed for church, stood in\r\nthe portico waiting for her father to come down and lift her into the\r\ncarriage, in which Adelaide, Louisa, and Enna were already seated.\r\n\r\nThe coachman was in his seat, and the horses, a pair of young and fiery\r\nsteeds purchased by Mr. Dinsmore only a few days before, were\r\nimpatiently stamping and tossing their heads, requiring quite an\r\nexertion of strength to hold them in.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t exactly like the actions of those horses, Ajax," remarked Mr.\r\nDinsmore, as he came out putting on his gloves; "I did not intend to\r\nhave them put in harness to-day. Why did you not give us the old bays?"\r\n\r\n"Kase, Marster Horace, ole Kate she\'s got a lame foot, an\' ole marster\r\nhe says dese youngsters is got to be used some time or nuther, an\' I\r\nreckoned I mout jis as well use \'em to-day."\r\n\r\n"Do you feel quite sure of being able to hold them in?" asked his\r\nmaster, glancing uneasily first at the horses and then at Elsie.\r\n\r\n"Ki! marster, dis here chile ben able to hold in a\'most anything,"\r\nexclaimed the negro, exhibiting a double row of dazzlingly white teeth;\r\n"an\' besides, I\'se drove dese here hosses twice \'fore now, an\' dey went\r\nsplendid. Hold \'em in! Yes, sah, easy as nuffin."\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said her father, still looking a little uneasy, in spite of\r\nAjax\'s boasting, "I think it would be just as well for you to stay at\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nElsie made no reply in words, but her answering look spoke such intense\r\ndisappointment, such earnest entreaty, that, saying, "Ah! well, I\r\nsuppose there is no real danger; and since you seem so anxious to go, I\r\nwill not compel you to stay at home," he lifted her into the carriage,\r\nand seating himself beside her, ordered the coachman to drive on as\r\ncarefully as he could.\r\n\r\n"Elsie, change seats with me," said Enna; "I want to sit beside Brother\r\nHorace."\r\n\r\n"No," replied Mr. Dinsmore, laying his hand on his little daughter\'s\r\nshoulder, "Elsie\'s place is by me, and she shall sit nowhere else."\r\n\r\n"Do you think we are in any danger of being run away with?" asked\r\nAdelaide, a little anxiously as she observed him glancing once or twice\r\nout of the window, and was at the same time sensible that their motion\r\nwas unusually rapid.\r\n\r\n"The horses are young and fiery, but Ajax is an excellent driver," he\r\nreplied, evasively; adding, "You may be sure that if I had thought the\r\ndanger very great I would have left Elsie at home."\r\n\r\nThey reached the church without accident, but on their return the\r\nhorses took fright while going down a hill, and rushed along at a\r\nfurious rate, which threatened every instant to upset the carriage.\r\n\r\nElsie thought they were going very fast, but did not know that there\r\nwas real danger until her father suddenly lifted her from her seat, and\r\nplacing her between his knees, held her tightly, as though he feared\r\nshe would be snatched from his grasp.\r\n\r\nElsie looked up into his face. It was deadly pale, and his eyes were\r\nfixed upon her with an expression of anguish.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," she whispered, "God will take care of us."\r\n\r\n"I would give all I am worth to have you safe at home," he answered\r\nhoarsely, pressing her closer and closer to him.\r\n\r\nO! even in that moment of fearful peril, when death seemed just at\r\nhand, those words, and the affectionate clasp of her father\'s arm, sent\r\na thrill of intense joy to the love-famished heart of the little girl.\r\n\r\nBut destruction seemed inevitable. Lora was leaning back, half fainting\r\nwith terror; Adelaide scarcely less alarmed, while Enna clung to her,\r\nsobbing most bitterly.\r\n\r\nElsie alone preserved a cheerful serenity. She had built her house upon\r\nthe rock, and knew that it would stand. Her destiny was in her Heavenly\r\nFather\'s hands, and she was content to leave it there. Even death had\r\nno terrors to the simple, unquestioning faith of the little child who\r\nhad put her trust in Jesus.\r\n\r\nBut they were not to perish thus; for at that moment a powerful negro,\r\nwho was walking along the road, hearing an unusual sound, turned about,\r\ncaught sight of the vehicle coming toward him at such a rapid rate, and\r\ninstantly comprehending the peril of the travellers, planted himself in\r\nthe middle of the road, and, at the risk of life and limb, caught the\r\nhorses by the bridle--the sudden and unexpected check throwing them\r\nupon their haunches, and bringing the carriage to an instant\r\nstand-still.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, we are saved! That fellow shall be well rewarded for his\r\nbrave deed," exclaimed Mr. Dinsmore, throwing open the carriage door.\r\n\r\nThen, leaping to the ground, he lifted Elsie out, set her down, and\r\ngave his hand to his sisters one after the other.\r\n\r\nThey were almost at the entrance of the avenue, and all preferred to\r\nwalk the short distance to the house rather than again trust themselves\r\nto the horses.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore lingered a moment to speak to the man who had done them\r\nsuch good service, and to give some directions to the coachman; and\r\nthen, taking the hand of his little girl, who had been waiting for him,\r\nhe walked slowly on, neither of them speaking a word until they reached\r\nthe house, when he stooped and kissed her cheek, asking very kindly if\r\nshe had recovered from her fright.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she answered, in a quiet tone, "I knew that God would take\r\ncare of us. Oh! wasn\'t He good to keep us all from being killed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, very gravely. "Go now and let mammy get you ready for\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\nAs Elsie was sitting alone in her room that afternoon she was surprised\r\nby a visit from Lora; it being very seldom that the elder girls cared\r\nto enter her apartment.\r\n\r\nLora looked a little pale, and more grave and thoughtful than Elsie had\r\never seen her. For a while she sat in silence, then suddenly burst out,\r\n"Oh, Elsie! I can\'t help thinking all the time, what if we had been\r\nkilled! where would we all be now? where would _I_ have been? I believe\r\n_you_ would have gone straight to heaven, Elsie; but _I_--oh! I should\r\nhave been with the rich man the minister read about this morning,\r\nlifting up my eyes in torment."\r\n\r\nAnd Lora covered her face with her hands and shuddered.\r\n\r\nPresently she went on again. "I was terribly frightened, and so were\r\nthe rest--all but you, Elsie; tell me, _do_--what kept _you_ from being\r\nafraid?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking," said Elsie gently, turning over the leaves of her\r\nlittle Bible as she spoke, "of this sweet verse: \'Yea, though I walk\r\nthrough the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for\r\nthou art with me;\' and oh, Lora! it made me so happy to think that\r\nJesus was there with me, and that if I were killed, I should only fall\r\nasleep, to wake up again in His arms; then how could I be afraid?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I would give anything to feel as you do," said Lora, sighing. "But\r\ntell me, Elsie, did you not feel afraid for the rest of us? I\'m sure\r\nyou must know that _we_ are not Christians; we don\'t even pretend to\r\nbe."\r\n\r\nElsie blushed and looked down.\r\n\r\n"It all passed so quickly, you know, Lora, almost in a moment," she\r\nsaid, "so that I only had time to think of papa and myself; and I have\r\nprayed so much for him that I felt quite sure God would spare him until\r\nhe should be prepared to die. It was very selfish, I know," she added\r\nwith deep humility; "but it was only for a moment, and I can\'t tell you\r\nhow thankful I was for _all_ our spared lives."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look so--as if you had done something very wicked, Elsie,"\r\nreplied Lora, sighing again. "I\'m sure we have given you little enough\r\nreason to care whatever becomes of us; but oh! Elsie, if you can only\r\ntell me how to be a Christian, I mean now to try very hard; indeed, I\r\nam determined never to rest until I am one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lora, how glad I am!" cried Elsie, joyfully, "for I know that if\r\nyou are really in earnest, you will succeed; for no one ever yet failed\r\nwho tried aright. Jesus said, \'_Every one_ that asketh, receiveth; and\r\nhe that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it _shall_ be\r\nopened.\' Is not _that_ encouraging? And listen to what God says here in\r\n_this_ verse: \'Ye shall seek me and _find_ me, when ye shall search for\r\nme with _all your heart_.\' So you see, dear Lora, if you will only seek\r\nthe Lord with your _whole heart_, you may be _sure_, _quite_ sure of\r\nfinding Him."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lora, "but you have not answered my question; _how_ am I to\r\nseek? that is, what means am I to use to get rid of my sins, and get a\r\nnew heart? how make myself pleasing in the sight of God? what must I\r\n_do_ to be saved?"\r\n\r\n"That is the very question the jailer put to Paul, and he answered,\r\n\'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,\'" replied\r\nElsie, quickly turning to the chapter and pointing out the text with\r\nher finger, that Lora might see that she had quoted it correctly. "And\r\nin answer to your other question, \'How shall I get rid of my sins?\' see\r\nhere: \'In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of\r\nDavid and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for\r\nuncleanliness.\' That is in Zechariah; then John tells us what that\r\nfountain is when he says, \'The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth\r\nus from all sin;\' and again, \'Unto Him that loved us, and washed us\r\nfrom our sins in His own blood.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Elsie, but what must I _do_?" asked Lora, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Do, Lora? only _believe_" replied Elsie, in the same earnest tone.\r\n"Jesus has done and suffered all that is necessary; and now we have\r\nnothing at all to do but go to Him and be washed in that fountain;\r\nbelieve Him when He says, \'I _give_ unto them eternal life;\' just\r\naccept the gift, and trust and love Him; that is the whole of it, and\r\nit is so simple that even such a little girl as I can understand it."\r\n\r\n"But surely, Elsie, I _can_, I _must do something_."\r\n\r\n"Yes, God tells us to repent; and He says, \'Give me thine heart;\' you\r\ncan do that; you can love Jesus; at least He will enable you to, if you\r\nask Him, and He will teach you to be sorry for your sins; the Bible\r\nsays, \'He is exalted to give repentance and remission of sins;\' and if\r\nyou ask Him He will give them to you. It is true we cannot do anything\r\ngood of ourselves; without the help of the Holy Spirit we can do\r\nnothing right, because we are so very wicked; but then we can always\r\nget that help if we ask for it. Jesus said, \'Your Heavenly Father is\r\nmore willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than parents\r\nare to give good gifts unto their children. Oh, Lora! don\'t be afraid\r\nto ask for it; don\'t be afraid to come to Jesus, for He says, \'Him that\r\ncometh unto Me, I will in nowise cast out;\' and He is such a precious\r\nSaviour, so kind and loving. But remember that you must come very\r\nhumbly; feeling that you are a great sinner, and not worthy to be\r\nheard, and only hoping to be forgiven, because Jesus died. The Bible\r\nsays, \'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.\'"\r\n\r\nLora lingered the greater part of the afternoon in Elsie\'s room, asking\r\nher questions, or listening to her while she read the Scriptures, or\r\nrepeated some beautiful hymn, or spoke in her sweet, childish way, of\r\nher own peace and joy in believing in Jesus.\r\n\r\nBut at last Lora went to her own room, and Elsie had another quiet\r\nhalf-hour to herself before the tea-bell again called the family\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nElsie answered the summons with a light heart--a heart that thrilled\r\nwith a new and strange sense of happiness as she remembered her\r\nfather\'s evident anxiety for her safety during their perilous ride,\r\nrecalling each word and look, and feeling again, in imagination, the\r\nclasp of his arm about her waist.\r\n\r\n"Ah! surely papa does love me," she murmured to herself over and over\r\nagain; and when he met her at the table with a kind smile, and laying\r\nhis hand caressingly on her head, asked in an affectionate tone, "How\r\ndoes my little daughter do this evening?" her cheeks flushed, and her\r\neyes grew bright with happiness, and she longed to throw her arms\r\naround his neck, and tell him how very, very much she loved him.\r\n\r\nBut that was quite impossible at the table, and before all the family;\r\nso she merely raised her glad eyes to his face and answered, "I am very\r\nwell, thank you, papa."\r\n\r\nBut, after all, this occurrence produced but little change in Elsie\'s\r\ncondition; her father treated her a little more affectionately for a\r\nday or two, and then gradually returned to his ordinary stern, cold\r\nmanner; indeed, before the week was out, she was again in sad disgrace.\r\n\r\nShe was walking alone in the garden one afternoon, when her attention\r\nwas attracted by a slight fluttering noise which seemed to proceed from\r\nan arbor near by, and on hastily turning in to ascertain the cause, she\r\nfound a tiny and beautiful humming-bird confined under a glass vase; in\r\nits struggles to escape it was fluttering and beating against the walls\r\nof its prison, thus producing the sound the little girl had heard in\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nElsie was very tender-hearted, and could never see any living creature\r\nin distress without feeling a strong desire to relieve its sufferings.\r\nShe knew that Arthur was in the habit of torturing every little insect\r\nand bird that came in his way, and had often drawn his persecutions\r\nupon herself by interfering in behalf of the poor victim; and now the\r\nthought instantly flashed upon her that _this_ was some of his work,\r\nand that he would return ere long to carry out his cruel purposes. Then\r\nat once arose the desire to release the little prisoner and save it\r\nfurther suffering, and without waiting to reflect a moment she raised\r\nthe glass, and the bird was gone.\r\n\r\nThen she began to think with a little tremor, how angry Arthur would\r\nbe; but it was too late to think of that now, and, after all, she did\r\nnot stand in very great dread of the consequences, especially as she\r\nfelt nearly sure of her father\'s approval of what she had done, having\r\nseveral times heard him reprove Arthur for his cruel practices.\r\n\r\nNot caring to meet Arthur then, however, she hastily retreated to the\r\nhouse, where she seated herself in the veranda with a book. It was a\r\nvery warm afternoon, and that, being on the east side of the house and\r\nwell protected by trees, shrubbery, and vines, was as cool a spot as\r\ncould be found on the place.\r\n\r\nArthur, Walter and Enna sat on the floor playing jack-stones--a\r\nfavorite game with them--and Louise was stretched full length on a\r\nsettee, buried in the latest novel.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" she said, as Walter gave a sudden shout at a successful toss\r\nEnna had just made; "can\'t you be quiet? Mamma is taking her afternoon\r\nnap, and you will disturb her; and, besides, I cannot read in such a\r\nnoise."\r\n\r\nElsie wondered why Arthur did not go to see after his bird, but soon\r\nforgot all about it in the interest with which she was poring over the\r\nstory of the "Swiss Family Robinson."\r\n\r\nThe jack-stone players were just finishing their game when they were\r\nall startled by the sudden appearance of Mr. Horace Dinsmore upon the\r\nscene, asking in a tone of great wrath who had been down in the garden\r\nand liberated the humming-bird he had been at such pains to catch,\r\nbecause it was one of a rare species, and he was anxious to add it to\r\nhis collection of curiosities.\r\n\r\nElsie was terribly frightened, and would have been glad at that moment\r\nto sink through the floor; she dropped her book in her lap, and\r\nclasping her hands over her beating heart, grew pale and red by turns,\r\nwhile she seemed choking with the vain effort to speak and acknowledge\r\nherself the culprit, as conscience told her she ought.\r\n\r\nBut her father was not looking at her; his eye was fixed on Arthur.\r\n\r\n"I presume it was you, sir," he said very angrily, "and if so, you may\r\nprepare yourself for either a flogging or a return to your prison, for\r\none or the other I am determined you shall have."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t _do_ it, any such thing," replied the boy, fiercely.\r\n\r\n"Of course you will deny it," said his brother, "but we all know that\r\nyour word is good for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Papa," said a trembling little voice, "Arthur did not do it; it was I."\r\n\r\n"You," exclaimed her father, in a tone of mingled anger and\r\nastonishment, as he turned his flashing eye upon her, "_you_, Elsie!\r\ncan it be _possible_ that this is _your_ doing?"\r\n\r\nElsie\'s book fell on the floor, and, covering her face with both hands,\r\nshe burst into sobs and tears.\r\n\r\n"Come here to me this instant," he said, seating himself on the settee,\r\nfrom which Louise had risen on his entrance. "Come here and tell me\r\nwhat you mean by meddling with my affairs in this way."\r\n\r\n"Please, papa, _please_ don\'t be so very angry with me," sobbed the\r\nlittle girl, as she rose and came forward in obedience to his command;\r\n"I didn\'t know it was your bird, and I didn\'t mean to be naughty."\r\n\r\n"No, you _never mean_ to be naughty, according to your own account," he\r\nsaid; "your badness is all accident; but nevertheless, I find you a\r\nvery troublesome, mischievous child; it was only the other day you\r\nbroke a valuable vase" (he forgot in his anger how little she had\r\nreally been to blame for that), "and now you have caused me the loss of\r\na rare specimen which I had spent a great deal of time and effort in\r\nprocuring. Really, Elsie, I am sorely tempted to administer a very\r\nsevere punishment."\r\n\r\nElsie caught at the arm of the settee for support.\r\n\r\n"Tell me what you did it for; was it pure love of mischief?" asked her\r\nfather, sternly, taking hold of her arm and holding her up by it.\r\n\r\n"No, papa," she answered almost under her breath. "I was sorry for the\r\nlittle bird. I thought Arthur had put it there to torture it, and so I\r\nlet it go. I did not mean to do wrong, papa, indeed I did not," and the\r\ntears fell faster and faster.\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said he, "you had no business to meddle with it, let who\r\nwould have put it there. Which hand did it?"\r\n\r\n"This one, papa," sobbed the child, indicating her right hand.\r\n\r\nHe took it in his and held it a moment, while the little girl stood\r\ntremblingly awaiting what was to come next. He looked at the downcast,\r\ntearful face, the bosom heaving with sobs, and then at the little\r\ntrembling hand he held, so soft, and white, and tender, and the\r\nsternness of his countenance relaxed somewhat; it seemed next to\r\nimpossible to inflict pain upon anything so tender and helpless; and\r\nfor a moment he was half inclined to kiss and forgive her. But no, he\r\nhad been very much irritated at his loss, and the remembrance of it\r\nagain aroused his anger, and well-nigh extinguished the little spark of\r\nlove and compassion that had burned for a moment in his heart. She\r\nshould be punished, though he would not inflict physical pain.\r\n\r\n"See, Elsie," laughed Louise, maliciously, "he is feeling in his pocket\r\nfor his knife. I suspect he intends to cut your hand off."\r\n\r\nElsie started, and the tearful eyes were raised to her father\'s face\r\nwith a look half of terrified entreaty, half of confidence that such\r\n_could not_ be his intention.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Louise!" exclaimed her brother, sternly; "you _know_ you are not\r\nspeaking truly, and that I would as soon think of cutting off my own\r\nhand as my child\'s. You should never speak anything but truth,\r\nespecially to children."\r\n\r\n"I think it is well enough to frighten them a little sometimes, and I\r\nthought that was what you were going to do," replied Louise, looking\r\nsomewhat mortified at the rebuke.\r\n\r\n"No," said her brother, "that is a very bad plan, and one which I shall\r\nnever adopt. Elsie will learn in time, if she does not know it now,\r\nthat I never utter a threat which I do not intend to carry out, and\r\nnever break my word."\r\n\r\nHe had drawn a handkerchief from his pocket while speaking.\r\n\r\n"I shall tie this hand up, Elsie," he said, proceeding to do so; "those\r\nwho do not use their hands aright must be deprived of the use of them.\r\nThere! let me see if that will keep it out of mischief. I shall tie you\r\nup hand and foot before long, if you continue such mischievous pranks.\r\nNow go to your room, and stay there until tea-time."\r\n\r\nElsie felt deeply, bitterly disgraced and humiliated as she turned to\r\nobey; and it needed not Arthur\'s triumphant chuckle nor the smirk of\r\nsatisfaction on Enna\'s face to add to the keen suffering of her wounded\r\nspirit; this slight punishment was more to her than a severe\r\nchastisement would have been to many another child; for the very\r\nknowledge of her father\'s displeasure was enough at any time to cause\r\ngreat pain to her sensitive spirit and gentle, loving heart.\r\n\r\nWalter, who was far more tender-hearted than either his brother or\r\nsister, felt touched by the sight of her distress, and ran after her to\r\nsay, "Never mind, Elsie; I am ever so sorry for you, and I don\'t think\r\nyou were the least bit naughty."\r\n\r\nShe thanked him with a grateful look, and a faint attempt to smile\r\nthrough her tears; then hurried on to her room, where she seated\r\nherself in a chair by the window, and laying her arms upon the sill,\r\nrested her head upon them, and while the bitter tears fell fast from\r\nher eyes she murmured half aloud, "Oh! why am I always so naughty?\r\nalways doing something to displease my dear papa? how I wish I could be\r\ngood, and make him love me! I am afraid he never will if I vex him so\r\noften."\r\n\r\nThen an earnest, importunate prayer for help to do right, and wisdom to\r\nunderstand how to gain her father\'s love, went up from the almost\r\ndespairing little heart to Him whose ear is ever open unto the cry of\r\nHis suffering children. And thus between weeping, mourning, and\r\npraying, an hour passed slowly away, and the tea-bell rang.\r\n\r\nElsie started up, but sat down again, feeling that she would much\r\nrather do without her supper than show her tear-swollen eyes and\r\ntied-up hand at the table.\r\n\r\nBut she was not to be left to her choice in the matter, for presently\r\nthere came a messenger bringing a peremptory command from her father\r\n"to come down _immediately_ to her supper."\r\n\r\n"Did you not hear the bell?" he asked, in his sternest tone, as she\r\ntremblingly took her seat at his side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," she answered, in a low, tremulous tone.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then; remember that you are always to come down the moment\r\nthe bell rings, unless you are directed otherwise, or are sick; and the\r\nnext time you are so late, I shall send you away without your meal."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any supper, papa," she said, humbly.\r\n\r\n"Hush," he replied, severely; "I will have no pouting or sulking; you\r\nmust just eat your supper and behave yourself. Stop this crying at\r\nonce," he added, in an undertone, as he spread some preserves on a\r\npiece of bread and laid it on her plate, "or I shall take you away from\r\nthe table, and if I do, you will be very sorry."\r\n\r\nHe watched her a moment while she made a violent effort to choke back\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n"What is your hand tied up for, Elsie?" asked her grandfather; "have\r\nyou been hurt?"\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face flushed painfully, but she made no reply.\r\n\r\n"You must speak when you are spoken to," said her father; "answer your\r\ngrandfather\'s question at once."\r\n\r\n"Papa tied it up, because I was naughty," replied the little girl,\r\nvainly striving to suppress a sob.\r\n\r\nHer father made a movement as if about to lead her from the table.\r\n\r\n"O papa! _don\'t_" she cried, in terror; "I will be good."\r\n\r\n"Let me have no more crying, then," said he; "this is shameful behavior\r\nfor a girl eight years old; it would be bad enough in a child of Enna\'s\r\nage." He took out his handkerchief and wiped her eyes. "Now," said he,\r\n"begin to eat your supper at once, and don\'t let me have to reprove you\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nElsie tried to obey, but it seemed very difficult, indeed almost\r\nimpossible, while she knew that her father was watching her closely,\r\nand _felt_ that everybody else was looking at her and thinking, "What a\r\nnaughty little girl you are!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" thought the poor child, "if papa would only quit looking at me,\r\nand the rest would forget all about me and eat their suppers, maybe I\r\ncould keep from crying." Then she sent up a silent prayer for help,\r\nstruggling hard to keep back the tears and sobs that were almost\r\nsuffocating her, and taking up her slice of bread, tried to eat.\r\n\r\nShe was very thankful to her Aunt Adelaide for addressing a question to\r\nher papa just at that moment, thus taking his attention from her, and\r\nthen adroitly setting them all to talking until the little girl had had\r\ntime to recover her composure, at least in a measure.\r\n\r\n"May I go to my room now, papa?" asked the timid little voice as they\r\nrose from the table.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, taking her hand and leading her out to the veranda,\r\nwhere he settled himself in an easy-chair and lighted a cigar.\r\n\r\n"Bring me that book that lies yonder on the settee," he commanded.\r\n\r\nShe brought it.\r\n\r\n"Now," said he, "bring that stool and set yourself down here close at\r\nmy knee, and let me see if I can keep you out of mischief for an hour\r\nor two."\r\n\r\n"May I get a book to read, papa?" she asked timidly.\r\n\r\n"No," said he shortly. "You may just do what I bid you, and nothing\r\nmore nor less."\r\n\r\nShe sat down as he directed, with her face turned toward him, and tried\r\nto amuse herself with her own thoughts, and watching the expression of\r\nhis countenance as he read on and on, turning leaf after leaf, too much\r\ninterested in his book to take any further notice of her.\r\n\r\n"How handsome my papa is!" thought the little girl, gazing with\r\naffectionate admiration into his face. And then she sighed, and tears\r\ntrembled in her eyes again. She admired her father, and loved him, "oh!\r\n_so_ dearly," as she often whispered to herself; but would she ever\r\nmeet with anything like a return of her  fond affection? There was an\r\naching void in her heart which nothing else could fill; must it always\r\nbe thus? was her craving for affection never to be satisfied? "O, papa!\r\nmy own papa, will you never love me?" mourned the sad little heart.\r\n"Ah! if I could only be good always, perhaps he would; but I am so\r\noften naughty;--whenever he begins to be kind I am sure to do something\r\nto vex him, and then it is all over. Oh! I _wish_ I _could_ be good! I\r\nwill try very, _very_ hard. Ah! if I might climb on his knee now, and\r\nlay my head on his breast, and put my arms round his neck, and tell him\r\nhow sorry I am that I have been naughty, and made him lose his bird;\r\nand how much--oh! _how_ much I love him! But I know I never could tell\r\nhim _that_--I don\'t know how to express it; no _words could_, I am\r\nsure. And if he would forgive me, and kiss me, and call me his dear\r\nlittle daughter. Oh! will he _ever_ call me _that?_ Or if I, might only\r\nstand beside him and lay my head on his shoulder, and he would put his\r\narm around me, it would make me _so_ happy."\r\n\r\nAn exclamation from Enna caused Elsie to turn her head, and suddenly\r\nspringing to her feet, she exclaimed in an eager, excited way, "Papa,\r\nthere is a carriage coming up the avenue--it must be visitors; please,\r\n_please_, papa, let me go to my room."\r\n\r\n"Why?" he asked coolly, looking up from his book, "why do you wish to\r\ngo?"\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t want to see them, papa," she said, hanging her head\r\nand blushing deeply; "I don\'t want them to see me."\r\n\r\n"You are not usually afraid of visitors," he replied in the same cool\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"But they will see that my hand is tied up, and they will ask what is\r\nthe matter. O papa! do, _please_ do let me go quickly, before they get\r\nhere," she pleaded in an agony of shame and haste.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "I shall not let you go, if it were only to punish you\r\nfor getting off the seat where I bade you stay, without permission. You\r\nwill have to learn that I am to be obeyed at all times, and under all\r\ncircumstances. Sit down, and don\'t dare to move again until I give you\r\nleave."\r\n\r\nElsie sat down without another word, but two bitter, scalding tears\r\nrolled quickly down her burning cheeks.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t cry, Elsie," said her father; "it is only an old gentleman\r\nwho comes to see your grandfather on business, and who, as he never\r\nnotices children, will not be at all likely to ask any questions. I\r\nhope you will learn some day, Elsie, to save your tears until there is\r\nreally some occasion for them."\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman had alighted while Mr. Dinsmore was speaking; Elsie\r\nsaw that he was alone, and the relief was so great that for once she\r\nscarcely heeded her father\'s rebuke.\r\n\r\nAnother half-hour passed, and Mr. Dinsmore still sat reading, taking no\r\nnotice of Elsie, who, afraid to speak or move, was growing very weary\r\nand sleepy. She longed to lay her head on her father\'s knee, but dared\r\nnot venture to take such a liberty; but at length she was so completely\r\noverpowered by sleep as to do so unconsciously.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice pronouncing her name aroused her.\r\n\r\n"You are tired and sleepy," said he; "if you would like to go to bed\r\nyou may do so."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, papa," she replied, rising to her feet.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, seeing her hesitate, "speak, if you have anything to\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry I was naughty, papa. Will you please forgive me?" The\r\nwords were spoken very low, and almost with a sob.\r\n\r\n"Will you try not to meddle in future, and not to cry at the table, or\r\npout and sulk when you are punished?" he asked in a cold, grave tone.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I will try to be a good girl always," said the humble little\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Then I will forgive you," he replied, taking the handkerchief off her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nStill Elsie lingered. She felt as if she could not go without some\r\nlittle token of forgiveness and love, some slight caress.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with an impatient "Well?" Then, in answer to her mute\r\nrequest, "No," he said, "I will not kiss you to-night; you have been\r\nentirely too naughty. Go to your room at once."\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe was absolutely frightened by the violence of her child\'s\r\ngrief, as she rushed into the room and flung herself into her arms\r\nweeping and sobbing most vehemently.\r\n\r\n"What\'s de matter, darlin\'?" she asked in great alarm.\r\n\r\n"O mammy, mammy!" sobbed the child, "papa wouldn\'t kiss me! he said I\r\nwas too naughty. O mammy! will he ever love me now?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on."\r\n                               --SHAKESPEARE, _Richard III_.\r\n\r\n   "A blossom full of promise is life\'s joy,\r\n    That never comes to fruit. Hope, for a time,\r\n    Suns the young flow\'ret in its gladsome light,\r\n    And it looks flourishing--a little while--\r\n    \'Tis pass\'d, we know not whither, but \'tis gone."\r\n                                 --MISS LANDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Day\'s custom to present to the parents of her pupils a\r\nmonthly report of their conduct and recitations. The regular time for\r\nthis had occurred once since Mr. Horace Dinsmore\'s return, when she, of\r\ncourse, handed Elsie\'s to him.\r\n\r\nIt was very satisfactory, for Elsie was a most diligent scholar,\r\ncarrying her religious principles into that as well as everything else;\r\nand disposed as Miss Day was to find fault with her, she could seldom\r\nsee any excuse for so doing, in either her conduct or recitations.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore glanced over the report and handed it back, saying, "It is\r\nall very good; very satisfactory indeed. I am glad to see that she is\r\nindustrious and well behaved, for I wish her to grow up an intelligent\r\nand amiable woman."\r\n\r\nElsie, who was standing near, heard the words, and they sent a glow of\r\npleasure to her cheeks. She looked up eagerly; but her father turned\r\nand walked away without taking any notice of her, and the glow of\r\nhappiness faded, and the soft eyes filled with tears of wounded feeling.\r\n\r\nIt was now time for a second report; but alas! the past month had been\r\na most unfortunate one for the little girl; the weather was very warm,\r\nand she had felt languid and weak, and so much were her thoughts\r\noccupied with the longing desire to gain her father\'s love, so\r\ndepressed were her spirits by her constant failure to do so, that she\r\noften found it impossible to give her mind to her lessons.\r\n\r\nArthur, too, during much of the time before and since the week of his\r\nimprisonment, had been more than usually annoying, shaking her chair\r\nand jogging her elbow so frequently when she was writing, that her\r\ncopy-book presented by no means so good an appearance as usual; and\r\nnever had Miss Day made out so poor a report for her. She carried it\r\nwith much secret satisfaction to the little girl\'s father, and entered\r\na long complaint of the child\'s idleness and inattention.\r\n\r\n"Send her to me," he said, angrily. "She will find me in my own room."\r\n\r\nMiss Day had left Elsie in the school-room putting her desk in order\r\nafter the day\'s work, and she found her still there on her return.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said she, with a malicious smile, "your father wishes to see\r\nyou immediately. He is in his room."\r\n\r\nThe child turned red and pale by turns, and trembled so violently that\r\nfor a moment she was quite unable to move; for she guessed from Miss\r\nDay\'s countenance what was probably in store for her.\r\n\r\n"I advise you to go at once," said that lady, "for no doubt the longer\r\nyou wait the worse it will be for you."\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mr. Dinsmore\'s voice was heard calling in a stern,\r\nangry tone, "Elsie!"\r\n\r\nMaking a violent effort to control her feelings, she started up and\r\nhastened to obey.\r\n\r\nThe door of his room stood open, and she walked in, asking in a\r\ntrembling voice, "Did you call me, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he, "I did. Come here to me."\r\n\r\nHe was sitting with the copy-book and report in his hand, and there was\r\nmuch severity in both tone and look as he addressed her.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed instantly, but trembling violently, and with a face pale as\r\ndeath, and eyes filled with tears. She lifted them pleadingly to his\r\nface; and, touched by her evident terror and distress, he said in a\r\ntone somewhat less stern, "Can you tell me, Elsie, how it happens that\r\nyour teacher brings me so bad a report of your conduct and lessons\r\nduring the past month? She says you have been very idle; and the report\r\ntells the same story; and this copy-book presents a shameful\r\nappearance."\r\n\r\nThe child answered only by tears and sobs.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to irritate him.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," he said, sternly, "when I ask a question, I require an answer,\r\nand that instantly."\r\n\r\n"O papa!" she answered, pleadingly, "I couldn\'t study. I\'m very\r\nsorry--I\'ll try to do better--only don\'t be very angry with me, dear\r\npapa."\r\n\r\n"I am angry with you; very angry, indeed," said he in the same severe\r\ntone, "and very strongly inclined to punish you. You _couldn\'t_ study,\r\neh? What reason can you assign, pray? Were you not well?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir," sobbed the little girl.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t _know_? Very well, then, I think you could not be very ill\r\nwithout knowing it, and so you seem to have no excuse at all to offer?\r\nHowever, I will not inflict any punishment upon you _this_ time, as you\r\nseem to be really sorry, and have promised to do better; but beware how\r\nyou let me see such a report as this, or hear such complaints of\r\nidleness again, unless you wish to be _severely punished_; and I warn\r\nyou that unless your next copy-book presents a better appearance  than\r\nthis, I certainly shall punish you.\r\n\r\n"There are a number of pages here that look quite well," he continued,\r\nturning over the leaves; "that shows what you _can_ do, if you choose;\r\nnow there is an old saying, \'A bird that _can_ sing, and _won\'t_ sing,\r\nmust be _made_ to sing.\' Hush!" as Elsie seemed about to speak; "not a\r\nword. You may go now." And throwing himself back in his easy-chair, he\r\ntook up a newspaper and began to read.\r\n\r\nYet Elsie lingered; her heart so yearned for one word or look of\r\nsympathy and love; she so longed to throw herself into his arms and\r\ntell him how dearly, how _very_ dearly she loved him; she did so hunger\r\nand thirst for one fond caress--ah! how could she go away without it\r\nnow, when for the very first time she found herself alone with him in\r\nhis own room, where she had never ventured before, but where she had\r\noften been in her brightest dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd so she lingered, trembling, hoping, fearing; but presently he\r\nlooked up with a cold "Why do you stand there? I gave you permission to\r\ngo; go at once." And with a sinking heart she turned away and sought\r\nthe solitude of her own room, there to weep, and mourn, and pray that\r\nshe might one day possess the love she so pined for, and bitterly to\r\nreproach herself for having by the failures of the past month put it\r\nfarther from her.\r\n\r\nAnd soon a thought came to her which added greatly to her distress. If\r\nArthur continued his persecutions, how could she make the next\r\ncopy-book more presentable? and in case it were not, her father had\r\nsaid positively that he would punish her; and oh! how could she bear\r\npunishment from him, when a word or look of displeasure almost broke\r\nher heart?\r\n\r\nMiss Day seldom remained in the school-room during the whole of the\r\nwriting hour, and sometimes the older girls were also absent, so that\r\nArthur had ample opportunity to indulge his mischievous propensities;\r\nfor Elsie was above the meanness of telling tales, and had she not\r\nbeen, Arthur was so great a favorite with his mother that she would\r\nhave brought a great deal of trouble upon herself by so doing.\r\n\r\nShe therefore saw no escape from the dreaded punishment, unless she\r\ncould persuade the perverse boy to cease his annoyances; and of that\r\nthere was little hope.\r\n\r\nBut she carried her trouble to her Heavenly Father, and asked Him to\r\nhelp her. She was still on her knees, pouring out her sobs and prayers,\r\nwhen some one knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nShe rose and opened it to find her Aunt Adelaide standing there.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," she said, "I am writing to Miss Rose; have you any word to\r\nsend? You may write a little note, if you choose, and I will enclose it\r\nin my letter. But what is the matter, child?" she suddenly exclaimed,\r\nkindly taking the little girl\'s hand in hers.\r\n\r\nWith many tears and sobs Elsie told her the whole story, not omitting\r\nher papa\'s threat, and her fear that she could not, on account of\r\nArthur\'s persecutions, avoid incurring the punishment.\r\n\r\nAdelaide\'s sympathies were enlisted, and she drew the sobbing child to\r\nher side, saying, as she pressed a kiss on her cheek, "Never mind,\r\nElsie, I will take my book or needle-work to the school-room every day,\r\nand sit there during the writing hour. But why don\'t you tell your papa\r\nabout it?"\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t like to tell tales, Aunt Adelaide, and it would make\r\nyour mamma so angry with me; and besides, I can\'t tell papa anything."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I understand! and no wonder; he is strangely stern to the poor\r\nchild. I mean to give him a good talking to," murmured Adelaide, more\r\nas if thinking aloud than talking to Elsie.\r\n\r\nThen, kissing the little girl again, she rose hastily and left the\r\nroom, with the intention of seeking her brother; but he had gone out;\r\nand when he returned he brought several gentlemen with him, and she had\r\nno opportunity until the desire to interfere in the matter had passed\r\nfrom her mind.\r\n\r\n"And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer, and\r\nwhile they are yet speaking, I will hear." The promise had been\r\nfulfilled to Elsie, and help had been sent her in her trouble.\r\n\r\nWhen her Aunt Adelaide left her, Elsie--first carefully locking the\r\ndoor to guard against a surprise visit from Enna--went to her bureau,\r\nand unlocking a drawer, took out a purse she was knitting for her\r\nfather, to replace the one she had given to Miss Allison.\r\n\r\nShe had commenced it before his return, and having spent upon it nearly\r\nevery spare moment since, when she could feel secure from intrusion,\r\nshe now had it nearly completed. Ah! many a silent tear had fallen as\r\nshe worked, and many a sigh over disappointed hopes had been woven into\r\nits bright meshes of gold and blue.\r\n\r\nBut now she had been much comforted and encouraged by her aunt\'s\r\nsympathy and kind promise of assistance, and, though there were still\r\ntraces of tears upon it, the little face looked quite bright and\r\ncheerful again as she settled herself in her little sewing chair, and\r\nbegan her work.\r\n\r\nThe small white fingers moved right briskly, the bright shining needles\r\nglancing in and out, while the thoughts, quite as busy, ran on\r\nsomething in this fashion: "Ah! I am so sorry I have done so badly the\r\npast month; no wonder papa was vexed with me. I don\'t believe I ever\r\nhad such a bad report before. What has come over me? It seems as if I\r\n_can\'t_ study, and must have a holiday. I wonder if it is all laziness?\r\nI\'m afraid it is, and that I ought to be punished. I wish I could shake\r\nit off, and feel industrious as I used to. I will try _very_ hard to do\r\nbetter this month, and perhaps I can. It is only one month, and then\r\nJune will be over, and Miss Day is going North to spend July and\r\nAugust, and maybe September, and so we shall have a long holiday.\r\nSurely I can stand it one month more; it will soon be over, though it\r\ndoes seem a long time, and besides, this month we are not to study so\r\nmany hours, because it is so warm; and there\'s to be no school on\r\nSaturdays; none to-morrow, so that I can finish this. Ah! I wonder if\r\npapa will be pleased?" and she sighed deeply. "I\'m afraid it will be a\r\nlong, long time before he will be pleased with me again. I have\r\ndispleased him twice this week--first about the bird, and now this bad\r\nreport, and that shameful copy-book. But oh! I will try _so_ hard next\r\nmonth, and dear Aunt Adelaide will keep Arthur from troubling me, and\r\nI\'m determined my copy-book shall look neat, and not have a single blot\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how I shall spend the vacation? Last summer I had such a\r\ndelightful visit at Ashlands; and then they were here all the rest of\r\nthe time. It was then poor Herbert had such a dreadful time with his\r\nhip. Ah! how thankful I ought to be that I am not lame, and have always\r\nbeen so healthy. But I\'m afraid papa won\'t let me go there this summer,\r\nnor ask them to visit me, because he said he thought Lucy was not a\r\nsuitable companion for me. I _was_ very naughty when she was here, and\r\nI\'ve been naughty a great many times since. Oh! dear, shall I never,\r\nnever learn to be good? It seems to me I am naughty now much oftener\r\nthan I used to be before papa came home. I\'m afraid he will soon begin\r\nto punish me severely, as he threatened to-day. I wonder what he means?"\r\n\r\nA crimson tide suddenly swept over the fair face and neck, and dropping\r\nher work, she covered her face with her hands. "Oh! he couldn\'t,\r\n_couldn\'t_ mean that! how could I ever bear it! and yet if it would\r\nmake me really good, I think I wouldn\'t mind the pain--but the shame\r\nand disgrace! oh! it would break my heart. I could never hold up my\r\nhead again! Oh! _can_ he mean that? But I must just try to be so very\r\ngood that I will never deserve punishment, and then it will make no\r\ndifference to me what he means." And with this consolatory reflection\r\nshe took up her work again.\r\n\r\n"Mammy, is papa in his room?" asked Elsie, the next afternoon, as she\r\nput the finishing touches to her work.\r\n\r\n"No, darlin\', Marster Horace he rode out wid de strange gentlemen more\r\nthan an hour ago."\r\n\r\nElsie laid her needles away in her work-basket, and opening her\r\nwriting-desk, selected a bit of note-paper, on which she wrote in her\r\nvery best hand, "A present for my dear papa, from his little daughter\r\nElsie!" This she carefully pinned to the purse, and then carried it to\r\nher papa\'s room, intending to leave it on his toilet-table.\r\n\r\nFearing that he might possibly have returned, she knocked gently at the\r\ndoor, but receiving no answer, opened it, and went in; but she had not\r\ngone more than half way across the room when she heard his voice behind\r\nher, asking, in a tone of mingled surprise and displeasure, "What are\r\nyou doing here in my room, in my absence, Elsie?"\r\n\r\nShe started, and turned round, pale and trembling, and lifting her eyes\r\npleadingly to his face, silently placed the purse in his hand.\r\n\r\nHe looked first at it, and then at her.\r\n\r\n"I made it for you, dear papa," she said, in a low, tremulous tone; "do\r\nplease take it."\r\n\r\n"It is really very pretty," he said, examining it; "is it possible it\r\nis your work? I had no idea you had so much taste and skill. Thank you,\r\ndaughter; I shall take it, and use it with a great deal of pleasure."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand as he spoke, and sitting down, lifted her to his knee,\r\nsaying, "Elsie, my child, why do you always seem so afraid of me? I\r\ndon\'t like it."\r\n\r\nWith a sudden impulse she threw her arms round his neck, and pressed\r\nher lips to his cheek; then dropping her head on his breast, she\r\nsobbed: "O papa! _dear_ papa, I _do love_ you so _very_ dearly! will\r\nyou not love me? O papa! love me a _little_. I know I\'ve been naughty\r\nvery often, but I will _try_ to be good."\r\n\r\nThen for the first time he folded her in his arms and kissed her\r\ntenderly, saying, in a moved tone, "I _do_ love you, my darling, my own\r\nlittle daughter."\r\n\r\nOh! the words were sweeter to Elsie\'s ear than the most delicious\r\nmusic! her joy was too great for words, for anything but tears.\r\n\r\n"Why do you cry so, my darling?" he asked, soothingly, stroking her\r\nhair, and kissing her again and again.\r\n\r\n"O papa! because I am so happy, so _very_ happy," she sobbed.\r\n\r\n"Do you indeed care so very much for my love?" he asked; "then, my\r\ndaughter, you must not tremble and turn pale whenever I speak to you,\r\nas though I were a cruel tyrant."\r\n\r\n"O papa! I cannot help it, when you look and speak so sternly. I love\r\nyou so dearly I cannot bear to have you angry with me; but I am not\r\nafraid of you now."\r\n\r\n"That is right," he said, caressing her again. "But there is the\r\ntea-bell," he added, setting her down. "Go into the dressing-room\r\nthere, and bathe your eyes, and then come to me."\r\n\r\nShe hastened to do his bidding, and then taking her hand he led her\r\ndown and seated her in her usual place by his side.\r\n\r\nThere were visitors, and all his conversation was addressed to them and\r\nthe older members of the family, but he now and then bestowed a kind\r\nlook upon his little girl, and attended carefully to all her wants; and\r\nElsie was very happy.\r\n\r\nEverything now went on very pleasantly with our little friend for some\r\ndays; she did not see a great deal of her father, as he was frequently\r\naway from home for a day or two, and, when he returned, generally\r\nbrought a number of visitors with him; but whenever he did notice her\r\nit was very kindly, and she was gradually overcoming her fear of him,\r\nand constantly hoping that the time would soon come when he would have\r\nmore leisure to bestow upon her. She was happy now, and with a mind at\r\nease, was able to learn her lessons well; and as her Aunt Adelaide\r\nfaithfully kept her promise, and thus freed her from Arthur\'s\r\nannoyances, she was enabled to do justice to her writing. She took\r\ngreat pains, her copy-book showed a marked improvement in her\r\npenmanship, and its pages had not yet been defaced by a single blot, so\r\nthat she was looking forward with pleasing anticipations to the time\r\nwhen her report should again be presented to her father.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! one unfortunate morning it happened that Miss Day was in a\r\nvery bad humor indeed--peevish, fretful, irritable, and unreasonable to\r\nthe last degree; and, as usual, Elsie was the principal sufferer from\r\nher ill-humor. She found fault with everything the little girl did;\r\nscolded her, shook her, refused to explain the manner of working out a\r\nvery difficult example, or to permit her to apply to any one else for\r\nassistance, and then punished her because it was done wrong; and when\r\nthe child could no longer keep back her tears, called her a baby for\r\ncrying, and a dunce for not understanding her arithmetic better.\r\n\r\nAll this Elsie bore meekly and patiently, not answering a word; but her\r\nmeekness seemed only to provoke the governess the more; and finally,\r\nwhen Elsie came to recite her last lesson, she took pains to put her\r\nquestions in the most perplexing form, and scarcely allowing the child\r\nan instant to begin her reply, answered them herself; then, throwing\r\ndown the book, scolded her vehemently for her bad lesson, and marked it\r\nin her report as a complete failure.\r\n\r\nPoor Elsie could bear no more, but bursting into tears and sobs, said:\r\n"Miss Day, I _did_ know my lesson, every word of it, if you had asked\r\nthe questions as usual, or had given me time to answer."\r\n\r\n"_I_ say that you did _not_ know it; that it was a complete failure,"\r\nreplied Miss Day, angrily; "and you shall just sit down and learn it,\r\nevery word, over."\r\n\r\n"I _do_ know it, if you will hear me right," said Elsie, indignantly,\r\n"and it is very unjust in you to mark it a failure."\r\n\r\n"Impudence!" exclaimed Miss Day, furiously; "how _dare_ you contradict\r\nme? I shall take you to your father."\r\n\r\nAnd seizing her by the arm, she dragged her across the room, and\r\nopening the door, pushed her into the passage.\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t, Miss Day," pleaded the little girl, turning toward her,\r\npale and tearful, "don\'t tell papa."\r\n\r\n"I will! so just walk along with you," was the angry rejoinder, as she\r\npushed her before her to Mr. Dinsmore\'s door. It stood open, and he sat\r\nat his desk, writing.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" he asked, looking up as they appeared before the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Elsie has been very impertinent, sir," said Miss Day; "she not only\r\naccused me of injustice, but contradicted me flatly."\r\n\r\n"Is it _possible!_" said he, frowning angrily. "Come here to me, Elsie,\r\nand tell me, is it _true_ that you contradicted your teacher?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," sobbed the child.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, I shall certainly punish you, for I will never allow\r\nanything of the kind."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he picked up a small ruler that lay before him, at the same\r\ntime taking Elsie\'s hand as though he meant to use it on her.\r\n\r\n"O papa!" she cried, in a tone of agonized entreaty.\r\n\r\nBut he laid it down again, saying: "No, I shall punish you by depriving\r\nyou of your play this afternoon, and giving you only bread and water\r\nfor your dinner. Sit down there," he added, pointing to a stool. Then,\r\nwith a wave of his hand to the governess, "I think she will not be\r\nguilty of the like again, Miss Day."\r\n\r\nThe governess left the room, and Elsie sat down on her stool, crying\r\nand sobbing violently, while her father went on with his writing.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," he said, presently, "cease that noise; I have had quite enough\r\nof it."\r\n\r\nShe struggled to suppress her sobs, but it was almost impossible, and\r\nshe felt it a great relief when a moment later the dinner-bell rang,\r\nand her father left the room.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a servant came in, carrying on a small waiter a\r\ntumbler of water, and a plate with a slice of bread on it.\r\n\r\n"Dis am _drefful_ poor fare, Miss Elsie," he said, setting it down\r\nbeside her, "but Massa Horace he say it all you can hab; but if you say\r\nso, dis chile tell ole Phoebe to send up somethin\' better fore Massa\r\nHorace gits through his dinner."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, thank you, Pompey; you\'re very kind, but I would not disobey\r\nor deceive papa," replied the little girl, earnestly; "and I am not at\r\nall hungry."\r\n\r\nHe lingered a moment, seeming loath to leave her to dine upon such fare.\r\n\r\n"You had better go now, Pompey," she said gently; "I am afraid you will\r\nbe wanted."\r\n\r\nHe turned and left the room, muttering something about "disagreeable,\r\ngood-for-nothing Miss Day!"\r\n\r\nElsie felt no disposition to eat; and when her father returned, half an\r\nhour afterward, the bread and water were still untouched.\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of this?" he asked in a stern, angry tone; "why\r\nhave you not eaten what I sent you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not hungry, papa," she said humbly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me that," he replied, "it is nothing but stubbornness; and\r\nI shall not allow you to show such a temper. Take up that bread this\r\nmoment and eat it. You shall eat every crumb of the bread and drink\r\nevery drop of the water."\r\n\r\nShe obeyed him instantly, breaking off a bit of bread and putting it in\r\nher mouth, while he stood watching her with an air of stern, cold\r\ndetermination; but when she attempted to swallow, it seemed utterly\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n"I cannot, papa," she said, "it chokes me."\r\n\r\n"You _must_," he replied; "I am going to be obeyed. Take a drink of\r\nwater, and that will wash it down."\r\n\r\nIt was a hard task, but seeing that there was no escape, she struggled\r\nto obey, and at length every crumb of bread and drop of water had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n"Now, Elsie," said her father, in a tone of great severity, "never\r\n_dare_ to show me such a temper as this again; you will not escape so\r\neasily next time; remember I am to be obeyed _always_; and when I send\r\nyou anything to eat, _you are to eat it_."\r\n\r\nIt had not been temper at all, and his unjust severity almost broke her\r\nheart; but she could not say one word in her own defence.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her a moment as she sat there trembling and weeping; then\r\nsaying, "I forbid you to leave this room without my permission; don\'t\r\nventure to disobey me, Elsie; sit where you are until I return," he\r\nturned to go.\r\n\r\n"Papa," she asked, pleadingly, "may I have my books, to learn my\r\nlessons for to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he said; "I will send a servant with them."\r\n\r\n"And my Bible too, please, papa."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he answered impatiently, as he went out and shut the door.\r\n\r\nJim was just bringing up Elsie\'s horse, as Mr. Dinsmore passed through\r\nthe hall, and he stepped out to order it back to the stable, saying\r\nthat Miss Elsie was not going to ride.\r\n\r\n"What is the trouble with Elsie?" asked his sister Adelaide, as he\r\nreturned to the drawing-room and seated himself beside her.\r\n\r\n"She has been impertinent to her governess, and I have confined her to\r\nmy room for the rest of the day," he replied, rather shortly.\r\n\r\n"Are you _sure_, Horace, that Elsie was so much to blame?" asked his\r\nsister, speaking in a tone too low to reach any ear but his. "I am\r\ncertain, from what Lora tells me, that Miss Day is often cruelly unjust\r\nto her; more so than to any other of her pupils."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a good deal of surprise.\r\n\r\n"Are you not mistaken?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No! it is a positive fact that she does at times _really abuse_ her."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! I shall certainly not allow _that_" he said, coloring with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n"But in this instance, Adelaide," he added thoughtfully, "I think you\r\nmust be mistaken, for Elsie _acknowledged_ that she had been\r\nimpertinent. I did not condemn her unheard, stern and severe as you\r\nthink me."\r\n\r\n"If she _was_, Horace, believe me it must have been only after great\r\nprovocation, and her acknowledgment of it is no proof at all, to my\r\nmind; for Elsie is so humble, she would think she _must_ have been\r\nguilty of impertinence if Miss Day accused her of it."\r\n\r\n"Surely not, Adelaide; she is by no means wanting in sense," he\r\nreplied, in a tone of incredulity, not unmixed with annoyance.\r\n\r\nThen he sat thinking a moment, half inclined to go to his child and\r\ninquire more particularly into the circumstances, but soon relinquished\r\nthe idea, saying to himself, "No; if she does not choose to be frank\r\nwith me, and say what she can in her own defence, she _deserves_ to\r\nsuffer; and besides, she showed such stubbornness about eating that\r\nbread."\r\n\r\nHe was very proud, and did not like to acknowledge even to _himself_\r\nthat he had punished his child unjustly--much less to _her_; and it was\r\nnot until near tea-time that he returned to his room, entering so\r\nsoftly that Elsie did not hear him.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting just where he had left her, bending over her Bible, an\r\nexpression of sadness and deep humility on the sweet little face, so\r\nyoung and fair and innocent. She did not seem aware of his presence\r\nuntil he was close beside her, when, looking up with a start, she said\r\nin a voice full of tears, "Dear papa, I am very sorry for all my\r\nnaughtiness; will you please forgive me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "certainly I will, if you are really sorry;" and\r\nstooping, he kissed her coldly, saying, "Now go to your room, and let\r\nChloe dress you for tea."\r\n\r\nShe rose at once, gathered up her books, and went out.\r\n\r\nThe little heart was very sad; for her father\'s manner was so cold she\r\nfeared he would never love her again. And she was particularly\r\ndistressed by the bad mark given her for recitation that day, because\r\nshe knew the time was now drawing very near when her report must be\r\nhanded in to her papa; and the delight with which she had hitherto\r\nlooked forward to receiving his well-merited approbation, was now\r\nchanged to fear, and dread of his displeasure;  yet she knew she had\r\nnot deserved the bad mark, and again and again she  determined that she\r\nwould tell her father all about it; but his manner had  now become so\r\ncold and stern that she could not summon up courage to do  so, but put\r\nit off from day to day, until it was too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n   "He that pursues an act that is attended\r\n    With doubtful issues, for the means, had need\r\n    Of policy and force to make it speed."\r\n                            --T. NABB\'s _Unfortunate Mother._\r\n\r\n              "Joy never feasts so high,\r\n    As when the first course is of misery."\r\n                                 --SUCKLING\'s _Aglaura._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Friday, and the next morning was the when the reports were to be\r\npresented. School had closed, and all but Elsie had already left the\r\nroom; but she was carefully arranging the books, writing and drawing\r\nmaterials, etc., in her desk, for she was very neat and orderly in her\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nWhen she had quite finished her work she took up her report-book, and\r\nglanced over it. As her eye rested for an instant upon the one bad\r\nmark, she sighed a little, and murmured to herself, "I am _so_ sorry; I\r\nwish papa knew how little I really deserved it. I don\'t know why I\r\nnever can get the courage to tell him."\r\n\r\nThen, laying it aside, she opened her copy-book and turned over the\r\nleaves with unalloyed pleasure, for not one of its pages was defaced by\r\na single blot, and from beginning to end it gave evidence of\r\npainstaking carefulness and decided improvement.\r\n\r\n"Ah! surely _this_ will please dear papa!" she exclaimed, half aloud.\r\n"How good Aunt Adelaide was to sit here with me!"\r\n\r\nThen, putting it carefully in its place, she closed and locked the\r\ndesk, and carrying the key to her room, laid it on the mantel, where\r\nshe was in the habit of keeping it.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that afternoon that Arthur, who had made himself\r\nsick by over-indulgence in sweetmeats, and had in consequence been\r\nlounging about the house doing nothing for the last day or two,\r\nremained at home while all the rest of the family were out, walking,\r\nriding, or visiting.\r\n\r\nHe was not usually very fond of reading, but while lying on the lounge\r\nin the nursery, very much in want of some amusement, it suddenly\r\noccurred to him that he would like to look at a book he had seen Elsie\r\nreading that morning.\r\n\r\nTo be sure the book belonged to her, and she was not there to be\r\nconsulted as to her willingness to lend it; but that made no difference\r\nto Arthur, who had very little respect for the rights of property,\r\nexcepting where his own were concerned.\r\n\r\nElsie, he knew, was out, and Chloe in the kitchen; so, feeling certain\r\nthere would be no one to interfere with him, he went directly to the\r\nlittle girl\'s room to look for the book. He soon found it lying on the\r\nmantel; but the desk-key lay right beside it, and as he caught sight of\r\nthat he gave a half scream of delight, for he guessed at once to what\r\nlock it belonged, and felt that he now could accomplish the revenge he\r\nhad plotted ever since the affair of the watch.\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand to take it, but drew it back again, and stood for a\r\nmoment balancing in his mind the chances of detection.\r\n\r\nHe could deface Elsie\'s copy-book, but Adelaide could testify to the\r\nlittle girl\'s carefulness and the neatness of her work up to that very\r\nday, for she had been in the school-room that morning during the\r\nwriting hour. But then Adelaide had just left home to pay a visit to a\r\nfriend living at some distance, and would not return for several weeks,\r\nso there was little danger from that quarter. Miss Day, to be sure,\r\nknew the appearance of Elsie\'s book quite as well, but there was still\r\nless danger of her interference, and he was pretty certain no one else\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nSo he decided to run the risk, and laying down the book he took the\r\nkey, went to the door, looked carefully up and down the hall to make\r\nsure of not being seen by any of the servants, and having satisfied\r\nhimself on that point, hurried to the school-room, unlocked Elsie\'s\r\ndesk, took out her copy-book, and dipping a pen in the ink, proceeded\r\ndeliberately to blot nearly every page in it; on some he made a large\r\nblot, on others a small one, and on some two or three; and also\r\nscribbled between the lines and on the margin, so as completely to\r\ndeface poor Elsie\'s work.\r\n\r\nBut to do Arthur justice, though he knew his brother would be pretty\r\nsure to be very angry with Elsie, he did not know of the threatened\r\npunishment. He stopped once or twice as he thought he heard a footstep,\r\nand shut down the lid until it had passed, when he raised it again and\r\nwent on with his wicked work. It did not take long, however, and he\r\nsoon replaced the copy-book in the precise spot in which he had found\r\nit, wiped the pen, and put it carefully back in its place, relocked the\r\ndesk, hurried back to Elsie\'s room, put the key just where he had found\r\nit, and taking the book, returned to the nursery without having met any\r\none.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself down on a couch and tried to read, but in vain; he\r\ncould not fix his attention upon the page--could think of nothing but\r\nthe mischief he had done, and its probable consequences; and now, when\r\nit was too late, he more than half repented; yet as to confessing and\r\nthus saving Elsie from unmerited blame, he did not for a single moment\r\nentertain the thought. But at length it suddenly occurred to him that\r\nif it became known that he had been into Elsie\'s room to get the book\r\nhe might be suspected; and he started up with the intention of\r\nreplacing it. But he found that it was too late; she had already\r\nreturned, for he heard her voice in the hall; so he lay down again, and\r\nkept the book until she came in search of it.\r\n\r\nHe looked very guilty as the little girl came in, but not seeming to\r\nnotice it, she merely said, "I am looking for my book. I thought\r\nperhaps some one might have brought it in here. Oh! _you_ have it,\r\nArthur! well, keep it, if you wish; I can read it just as well another\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Here, take it," said he roughly, pushing it toward her; "I don\'t want\r\nit; \'tisn\'t a bit pretty."\r\n\r\n"I think it is very interesting, and you are quite welcome to read it\r\nif you wish," she answered mildly; "but if you don\'t care to, I will\r\ntake it."\r\n\r\n"Young ladies and gentlemen," said the governess, as they were about\r\nclosing their exercises the next morning, "this is the regular day for\r\nthe reports, and they are all made out. Miss Elsie, here is yours;\r\nbring your copy-book, and carry both to your papa."\r\n\r\nElsie obeyed, not without some trembling, yet hoping, as there was but\r\n_one_ bad mark in the report and the copy-book showed such evident\r\nmarks of care and painstaking, her papa would not be very seriously\r\ndispleased.\r\n\r\nIt being the last day of the term, the exercises of the morning had\r\nvaried somewhat from the usual routine, and the writing hour had been\r\nentirely omitted; thus it happened that Elsie had not opened her\r\ncopy-book, and was in consequence still in ignorance of its sadly\r\naltered appearance.\r\n\r\nShe found her father in his room. He took the report first from her\r\nhand, and glancing over it, said with a slight frown, "I see you have\r\none _very_ bad mark for recitation; but as there is only one, and the\r\nothers are remarkably good, I will excuse it."\r\n\r\nThen taking the copy-book and opening it, much to Elsie\'s surprise and\r\nalarm he gave her a glance of great displeasure, turned rapidly over\r\nthe leaves, then laying it down, said in his sternest tones, "I see I\r\nshall have to keep my promise, Elsie."\r\n\r\n"What, papa?" she asked, turning pale with terror.\r\n\r\n"_What!_" said he! "do you ask me what? Did I not tell you _positively_\r\nthat I would _punish_ you if your copy-book this month did not present\r\na better appearance than it did last?"\r\n\r\n"O papa! does it not? I tried so very hard; and there are no blots in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No blots?" said he; "what do you call these?" and he turned over the\r\nleaves again, holding the book so that she could see them, and showing\r\nthat almost every one was blotted in several places.\r\n\r\nElsie gazed at them in unfeigned astonishment; then looking up into his\r\nface, she said earnestly but fearfully, "Papa, I did not do it."\r\n\r\n"Who did, then?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, papa, I do not know," she replied.\r\n\r\n"I must inquire into this business," he said, rising, "and if it is not\r\nyour fault you shall not be punished; but if I find you have been\r\ntelling me a falsehood, Elsie, I shall punish you much more severely\r\nthan if you had not denied your fault."\r\n\r\nAnd taking her by the hand as he spoke, he led her back to the\r\nschool-room.\r\n\r\n"Miss Day," said he, showing the book, "Elsie says these blots are not\r\nher work; can you tell me whose they are?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Elsie _generally_ tells the truth, sir," replied Miss Day,\r\nsarcastically, "but I must say that in this instance I think she has\r\nfailed, as her desk has a good lock, and she herself keeps the key."\r\n\r\n"Elsie," he asked, turning to her, "is this so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"And have you ever left your desk unlocked, or the key lying about?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa. I am quite certain I have not," she answered unhesitatingly,\r\nthough her voice trembled, and she grey very pale.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, _I_ am quite certain you have told me a falsehood,\r\nsince it is evident this _must_ have been your work. Elsie, I can\r\nforgive anything but falsehood, but that I _never will_ forgive. Come\r\nwith me. I shall teach you to speak the truth to _me_ at least, if to\r\nno one else," and taking her hand again, he led, or rather dragged, her\r\nfrom the room, for he was terribly angry, his face fairly pale with\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nLora came in while he was speaking and, certain that _Elsie_ would\r\nnever be caught in a falsehood, her eye quickly sought Arthur\'s desk.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting there with a very guilty countenance.\r\n\r\nShe hastily crossed the room, and speaking in a low tone, said,\r\n"Arthur, _you_ have had a hand in this business I very well know; now\r\nconfess it quickly, or Horace will half kill Elsie."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know anything about it," said he doggedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," she answered; "and if you do not speak out at once, _I_\r\nshall save Elsie, and find means to prove your guilt afterwards; so you\r\nhad much better confess."\r\n\r\n"Go away," he exclaimed angrily, "I have nothing to confess."\r\n\r\nSeeing it was useless to try to move him, Lora turned away and hurried\r\nto Horace\'s room, which, in her haste, she entered without knocking, he\r\nhaving fortunately neglected to fasten the door. She was just in time;\r\nhe had a small riding whip in his hand, and Elsie stood beside him pale\r\nas death, too much frightened even to cry, and trembling so that she\r\ncould scarcely stand.\r\n\r\nHe turned an angry glance on his sister as she entered; but taking no\r\nnotice of it, she exclaimed eagerly, "Horace, don\'t punish Elsie, for I\r\nam certain she is innocent."\r\n\r\nHe laid down the whip asking, "_How_ do you know it? what _proof_ have\r\nyou? I shall be very glad to be convinced," he added, his countenance\r\nrelaxing somewhat in its stern and angry expression.\r\n\r\n"In the first place," replied his sister, "there is Elsie\'s established\r\ncharacter for truthfulness--in all the time she has been with us, we\r\nhave ever found her perfectly truthful in word and deed. And then,\r\nHorace, what motive could she have had for spoiling her book, knowing\r\nas she did that certain punishment would follow? Besides, I am sure\r\nArthur is at the bottom of this, for though he will not acknowledge, he\r\ndoes not deny it. Ah! yes, and now I recollect, I saw and examined\r\nElsie\'s book only yesterday, and it was then quite free from blots."\r\n\r\nA great change had come over her brother\'s countenance while she was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Lora," he said, cordially, as soon as she had done, "you\r\nhave quite convinced me, and saved me from punishing Elsie as unjustly\r\nas severely. That last assurance I consider quite sufficient of itself\r\nto establish her innocence."\r\n\r\nLora turned and went out feeling very happy, and as she closed the\r\ndoor, Elsie\'s papa took her in his arms, saying in loving, tender\r\ntones, "My poor little daughter! my own darling child! I have been\r\ncruelly unjust to you, have I not?"\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, you thought I deserved it," she said, with a burst of tears\r\nand sobs, throwing her arms around his neck, and laying her head on his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n"Do you love me, Elsie, dearest?" he asked, folding her closer to his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"Ah! so very, _very_ much! better than all the world beside. O papa! if\r\nyou would only love me." The last word was almost a sob.\r\n\r\n"I do, my darling, my own precious child," he said, caressing her again\r\nand again. "I do love my little girl, although I may at times seem cold\r\nand stern; and I am more thankful than words can express that I have\r\nbeen saved from punishing her unjustly. I could never forgive myself if\r\nI had done it. I would rather have lost half I am worth; ah! I fear it\r\nwould have turned all her love for me into hatred; and justly, too."\r\n\r\n"No, papa, oh! no, _no; nothing_ could ever do that!" and the little\r\narms were clasped closer and closer about his neck, and the tears again\r\nfell like rain, as she timidly pressed her quivering lips to his cheek.\r\n\r\n"There, there daughter! don\'t cry any more; we will try to forget all\r\nabout it, and talk of something else," he said soothingly. "Elsie,\r\ndear, your Aunt Adelaide thinks perhaps you were not so very much to\r\nblame the other day; and now I want you to tell me all the\r\ncircumstances; for though I should be very sorry to encourage you to\r\nfind fault with your teacher, I am by no means willing to have you\r\nabused."\r\n\r\n"Please, papa, don\'t ask me," she begged. "Aunt Lora was there, and she\r\nwill tell you about it."\r\n\r\n"No, Elsie," he said, very decidedly; "I want the story from _you_; and\r\nremember, I want _every word_ that passed between you and Miss Day, as\r\nfar as you can possibly recall it."\r\n\r\nSeeing that he was determined, Elsie obeyed him, though with evident\r\nreluctance, and striving to put Miss Day\'s conduct in as favorable a\r\nlight as consistent with truth, while she by no means extenuated her\r\nown; yet her father listened with feelings of strong indignation.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," he said when she had done, "if I had known all this at the\r\ntime, I should not have punished you at all. Why did you not tell me,\r\nmy daughter, how you have been ill treated and provoked?"\r\n\r\n"O papa! I could not; you know you did not ask me."\r\n\r\n"I did ask you if it was true that you contradicted her, did I not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, and it was true."\r\n\r\n"You ought to have told me the whole story though; but I see how it\r\nwas--I frightened you by my sternness. Well, daughter," he added,\r\nkissing her tenderly, "I shall endeavor to be less stern in future, and\r\nyou must try to be less timid and more at your ease with me."\r\n\r\n"I will, papa," she replied meekly; "but indeed I cannot help feeling\r\nfrightened when you are angry with me."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore sat there a long time with his little daughter on his\r\nknee, caressing her more tenderly than ever before; and Elsie was very\r\nhappy, and talked more freely to him than she had ever done, telling\r\nhim of her joys and her sorrows; how dearly she had loved Miss\r\nAllison--what happy hours they had spent together in studying the Bible\r\nand in prayer--how grieved she was when her friend went away--and how\r\nintensely she enjoyed the little letter now and then received from her;\r\nand he listened to it all, apparently both pleased and interested,\r\nencouraging her to go on by an occasional question or a word of assent\r\nor approval.\r\n\r\n"What is this, Elsie?" he asked, taking hold of the chain she always\r\nwore around her neck, and drawing the miniature from her bosom.\r\n\r\nBut as he touched the spring the case flew open, revealing the sweet,\r\ngirlish face, it needed not Elsie\'s low murmured "Mamma" to tell him\r\nwho that lovely lady was.\r\n\r\nHe gazed upon it with emotion, carried back in memory to the time when\r\nfor a few short months she had been his own most cherished treasure.\r\nThen, looking from it to his child, he murmured, "Yes, she is very\r\nlike--the same features, the same expression, complexion, hair and\r\nall--will be the very counterpart of her if she lives."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, am I like mamma?" asked Elsie, who had caught a part of his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n"Yes, darling, very much indeed, and I hope you will grow more so."\r\n\r\n"You loved mamma?" she said inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Dearly, _very_ dearly."\r\n\r\n"O papa! _tell_ me about her! _do_, dear papa," she pleaded eagerly.\r\n\r\n"I have not much to tell," he said, sighing. "I knew her only for a few\r\nshort months ere we were torn asunder, never to meet again on earth."\r\n\r\n"But we may hope to meet her in heaven, dear papa," said Elsie softly,\r\n"for she loved Jesus, and if we love Him we shall go there too when we\r\ndie. Do you love Jesus, papa?" she timidly inquired, for she had seen\r\nhim do a number of things which she knew to be wrong--such as riding\r\nout for pleasure on the Sabbath, reading secular newspapers, and\r\nengaging in worldly conversation--and she greatly feared he did not.\r\n\r\nBut instead of answering her question, he asked, "Do you, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, sir; very _very_ much; even better than I love you, my own\r\ndear papa."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?" he asked, looking keenly into her face.\r\n\r\n"Just as I know that I love you, papa, or any one else," she replied,\r\nlifting her eyes to his face in evident surprise at the strangeness of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n"Ah, papa," she added in her own sweet, simple way, "I do so love to\r\ntalk of Jesus; to tell Him all my troubles, and ask Him to forgive my\r\nsins and make me holy; and then it is so sweet to know that He loves\r\nme, and will _always_ love me, even if no one else does."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her very gravely, and set her down, saying, "Go now, my\r\ndaughter, and prepare for dinner; it is almost time for the bell."\r\n\r\n"You are not displeased, papa?" she inquired, looking up anxiously into\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n"No, darling, not at all," he replied, stroking her hair. "Shall I ride\r\nwith my little girl this afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"Oh papa! do you really mean it? I shall be so glad!" she exclaimed\r\njoyfully.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," he said, "it is settled. But go now; there is the\r\nbell. No, stay!" he added quickly, as she turned to obey; "think a\r\nmoment and tell me where you put the key of your desk yesterday, for it\r\nmust have been then the mischief was done. Had you it with you when you\r\nrode out?"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Elsie\'s face flushed, and she exclaimed Eagerly, "Ah! I\r\nremember now! I left it on the mantelpiece, papa, and--"\r\n\r\nBut here she paused, as if sorry she had said so much.\r\n\r\n"And what?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I think I had better not say it, papa! I\'m afraid I _ought_ not, for I\r\ndon\'t really _know_ anything, and it seems so wrong to suspect people."\r\n\r\n"You need not express any suspicions," said her father; "I do not wish\r\nyou to do so; but I must insist upon having all the facts you can\r\nfurnish me with. Was Aunt Chloe in your room all the time you were\r\naway?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; she told me she went down to the kitchen directly after I\r\nleft, and did not come up again until after I returned."\r\n\r\n"Very well; do you know whether any one else entered the room during\r\nyour absence?"\r\n\r\n"I do not _know_, papa, but I _think_ Arthur must have been in, because\r\nwhen I came home I found him reading a book which I had left lying on\r\nthe mantel-piece," she answered in a low, reluctant tone.\r\n\r\n"Ah, ha! that is just it! I see it all now," he exclaimed, with a\r\nsatisfied nod. "There, that will do, Elsie; go now and make haste down\r\nto your dinner."\r\n\r\nBut Elsie lingered, and, in answer to a look of kind inquiry from her\r\nfather, said coaxingly, "Please, papa, don\'t be very angry with him. I\r\nthink he did not know how much I cared about my book."\r\n\r\n"You are very forgiving, Elsie; but go, child, I shall not abuse him,"\r\nMr. Dinsmore answered, with an imperative gesture, and the little girl\r\nhurried from the room.\r\n\r\nIt happened that just at this time the elder Mr. Dinsmore and his wife\r\nwere paying a visit to some friends in the city, and thus Elsie\'s papa\r\nhad been left head of the house for the time. Arthur, knowing this to\r\nbe the state of affairs, and that though his father was expected to\r\nreturn that evening, his mother would be absent for some days, was\r\nbeginning to be a good deal fearful of the consequences of his\r\nmisconduct, and not without reason, for his brother\'s wrath was now\r\nfully aroused, and he was determined that the boy should not on this\r\noccasion escape the penalty of his misdeeds.\r\n\r\nArthur was already in the dining-room when Mr. Dinsmore came down.\r\n\r\n"Arthur," said he, "I wish you to step into the library a moment; I\r\nhave something to say to you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to hear it," muttered the boy, with a dogged look, and\r\nstanding perfectly still.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, sir; but that makes no difference," replied his\r\nbrother. "Walk into the library at once."\r\n\r\nArthur returned a scowl of defiance, muttering almost under his breath,\r\n"I\'ll do as I please about that;" but cowed by his brother\'s determined\r\nlook and manner, he slowly and reluctantly obeyed.\r\n\r\n"Now, sir," said Mr. Dinsmore, when he had him fairly in the room, and\r\nhad closed the door behind them, "I wish to know how you came to meddle\r\nwith Elsie\'s copy-book."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," was the angry rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"Take care, sir; I know all about it," said Mr. Dinsmore, in a warning\r\ntone; "it is useless for you to deny it. Yesterday, while Elsie was out\r\nand Aunt Chloe in the kitchen, you went to her room, took the key of\r\nher desk from the mantel-piece where she had left it, went to the\r\nschool-room and did the mischief, hoping to get her into trouble\r\nthereby, and then relocking the desk and returning the key to its\r\nproper place, thought you had escaped detection; and I was very near\r\ngiving my poor, innocent little girl the whipping you so richly\r\ndeserve."\r\n\r\nArthur looked up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Who told you?" he asked; "nobody saw me;" then, catching himself, said\r\nhastily, "I tell you I didn\'t do it. I don\'t know anything about it."\r\n\r\n"Will you dare to tell me such a falsehood as that again?" exclaimed\r\nMr. Dinsmore, angrily, taking him by the collar and shaking him roughly.\r\n\r\n"Let me alone now," whined the culprit. "I want my dinner, I say."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get no dinner to-day, I can tell you," replied his brother. "I\r\nam going to lock you into your bedroom, and keep you there until your\r\nfather comes home; and then if _he_ doesn\'t give you the flogging you\r\ndeserve, _I_ will; for I intend you shall have your deserts for once in\r\nyour life. I know that all this is in revenge for Elsie\'s forced\r\ntestimony in the affair of the watch, and I gave you fair warning then\r\nthat I would see to it that any attempt to abuse my child should\r\nreceive its just reward."\r\n\r\nHe took the boy by the arm as he spoke, to lead him from the room.\r\n\r\nAt first Arthur seemed disposed to resist; but soon, seeing how useless\r\nit was to contend against such odds, he resigned himself to his fate,\r\nsaying sullenly, "You wouldn\'t treat me this way if mamma was at home."\r\n\r\n"She is not, however, as it happens, though I can tell you that even\r\n_she_ could not save you now," replied his brother, as he opened the\r\nbedroom door, and pushing him in, locked it upon him, and put the key\r\nin his pocket.\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Dinsmore had almost unbounded influence over his father, who\r\nwas very proud of him; the old gentleman also utterly despised\r\neverything mean and underhanded, and upon being made acquainted by\r\nHorace with Arthur\'s misdemeanors he inflicted upon him as severe a\r\npunishment as any one could have desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God\r\n    hath commanded thee."\r\n                                 --_Deut._ v. 12.\r\n\r\n                         "She is mine own;\r\n    And I as rich in having such a jewel\r\n    As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,\r\n    The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold."\r\n                    --SHAKESPEARE, _Two Gentlemen of Verona._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now happy days had come to the little Elsie. Her father treated her\r\nwith the tenderest affection, and kept her with him almost constantly,\r\nseeming scarcely willing to have her out of his sight for an hour. He\r\ntook her with him wherever he went in his rides and walks and visits to\r\nthe neighboring planters.\r\n\r\nShe was much admired for her beauty and sweetness of disposition, much\r\ncaressed and flattered, but, through it all, lost none of her native\r\nmodesty, but was ever the same meek, gentle little girl. She felt\r\ngrateful for all the kindness she received, and liked to visit with her\r\npapa; but her happiest days were spent at home on those rare occasions\r\nwhen they were free from visitors, and she could sit for hours on his\r\nknee, or by his side, talking or reading to him, or working at her\r\nembroidery, or knitting and listening while he read. He helped her with\r\nall her studies, taught her something of botany and geology in their\r\nwalks, helped her to see and correct the faults of her drawings, sang\r\nwith her when she played, bought her quantities of new music, and\r\nengaged the best masters to instruct her--in short, took a lively\r\ninterest in all her pursuits and pleasures, gave her every indulgence,\r\nand lavished upon her the tenderest caresses. He was very proud of her\r\nbeauty, her sweetness, her intelligence, and talent; and nothing\r\npleased him better than to hear them spoken of by others in terms of\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nAnd Elsie was very happy; the soft eyes grew bright with happiness, and\r\nthe little face lost its pensive expression, and became as round, rosy\r\nand merry as Enna\'s.\r\n\r\nMiss Day went North, expecting to be absent several months, and Elsie\'s\r\npapa took her traveling, spending some time at different\r\nwatering-places. It was her first journey since she had been old enough\r\nto care for such things, and she enjoyed it exceedingly. They left home\r\nin July, and did not return until September, so that the little girl\r\nhad time to rest and recruit, both mentally and physically, and was\r\nready to begin her studies again with zeal and energy; yet it was so\r\npleasant to be her papa\'s constant companion, and she had so enjoyed\r\nher freedom from the restraints of the school-room, that she was not at\r\nall sorry to learn, on their arrival at Roselands, that the governess\r\nwould still be absent for some weeks.\r\n\r\n"How bright and happy the child looks!" was Adelaide\'s remark on the\r\nday of their return, as, from the opposite side of the room, she\r\nwatched the speaking countenance of the little girl, who was giving\r\nEnna and the boys an animated description of her journey.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lora, "and how entirely she seems to have overcome her fear\r\nof her father!" for at that instant Elsie suddenly left the little\r\ngroup, and running to him, leaned confidingly on his knee, while\r\napparently urging some request, which he answered with a smile and a\r\nnod of acquiescence; when she left the room, and presently returned\r\ncarrying a richly bound book of engravings.\r\n\r\nYes, Elsie had lost her fear of her father, and could now talk to him,\r\nand tell him her feelings and wishes, as freely as ever Enna did; and\r\nno wonder, for in all these weeks he had never given her one harsh word\r\nor look; but indeed he had had no occasion to do so, for she was always\r\ndocile and obedient.\r\n\r\nIt was Sabbath afternoon--the first Sabbath after their return--and\r\nElsie was in her own room alone with the books she loved best--her\r\nBible, hymnbook, and "Pilgrim\'s Progress."\r\n\r\nShe had spent a very happy hour in self-examination, reading and\r\nprayer, and was singing to herself in a low tone her favorite hymn,\r\n\r\n    "I lay my sins on Jesus,"\r\n\r\nwhile turning over the leaves of her Bible to find the story of Elijah,\r\nwhich she had promised to read to Chloe that afternoon, when a child\'s\r\nfootsteps were heard coming down the hall, the handle of the door was\r\nturned hastily, and then, as it refused to yield, Enna\'s voice called\r\nout in a fretful, imperious tone, "Open this door, Elsie Dinsmore. I\r\nwant in, I say."\r\n\r\nElsie sighed, as she thought, "There is an end to my nice afternoon,"\r\nbut she rose at once, and quickly crossing the room, opened the door,\r\nasking pleasantly, "What do you want, Enna?"\r\n\r\n"I _told_ you I wanted to come _in_," replied Enna, saucily, "and now\r\nyou\'ve got to tell me a story to amuse me; mamma says so, because you\r\nknow I\'ve got a cold, and she won\'t let me go out."\r\n\r\n"Well, Enna," said Elsie, patiently, "I am going to read a very\r\nbeautiful story to mammy, and you are quite welcome to sit here and\r\nlisten."\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t have it read! I said you were to _tell_ it. I don\'t like to\r\nhear reading," replied Enna in her imperious way, at the same time\r\ntaking quiet possession of Elsie\'s little rosewood rocking-chair--a\r\nlate present from her papa, and highly prized by the little girl on\r\nthat account--and beginning to scratch with her thumb nail upon the arm.\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t scratch my pretty new chair, Enna!" Elsie entreated; "it is\r\npapa\'s present, and I wouldn\'t have it spoiled for a great deal."\r\n\r\n"I will; who cares for your old chair?" was the reply in a scornful\r\ntone, as she gave another and harder dig with her nail. "You\'re a\r\nlittle old maid--so particular with all your things--that\'s what mamma\r\nsays you are. Now tell me that story."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you a story if you will stop scratching my chair, Enna,"\r\nsaid Elsie, almost with tears in her eyes, "I will tell you about\r\nElijah on Mount Carmel or Beishazzar\'s feast, or the children in the\r\nfiery furnace, or----"\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t hear any of those! I don\'t want any of your old Bible\r\nstories," interrupted Enna, insolently, "You must tell me that pretty\r\nfairy tale Herbert Carrington is so fond of."\r\n\r\n"No, Enna; I cannot tell you that _to-day_," replied Elsie, speaking\r\ngently, but very firmly.\r\n\r\n"I say you _shall!_" screamed Enna, springing to her feet. "I\'ll just\r\ngo and tell mamma, and she\'ll make you do it."\r\n\r\n"Stay, Enna," said Elsie, catching her hand to detain her; "I will tell\r\nyou any story I know that is suitable for the Sabbath; but I cannot\r\ntell the fairy tale to-day, because you know it would be wrong. I will\r\ntell it to you to-morrow, though, if you will wait."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a _bad_ girl, and I\'ll just tell mamma of you," exclaimed Enna,\r\npassionately, jerking her hand away and darting from the room.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if papa was only at home," sighed Elsie, sinking into her\r\nrocking-chair, pale and trembling; but she knew that he had gone out\r\nriding, and would probably not return for some time; he had invited her\r\nto accompany him, but she had begged to be allowed to stay at home, and\r\nhe had let her have her wish.\r\n\r\nAs she feared, she was immediately summoned to Mrs. Dinsmore\'s presence.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," said that lady, severely, "are you not ashamed of yourself, to\r\nrefuse Enna such a small favor especially when the poor child is not\r\nwell. I must say you are the most selfish, disobliging child I ever\r\nsaw."\r\n\r\n"I offered to tell her a Bible story, or anything suitable for the\r\nSabbath day," replied Elsie, meekly, "but I cannot tell the fairy tale,\r\nbecause it would be wrong."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! there\'s no harm at all in telling fairy tales to-day, any\r\nmore than any other day; that is just an excuse, Elsie," said Mrs.\r\nDinsmore, angrily.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want her old Bible stories. I won\'t have them. I want that\r\npretty fairy tale," sobbed Enna passionately; "_make_ her tell it,\r\nmamma."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, what is all this fuss about?" asked the elder Mr.\r\nDinsmore, coming in from an adjoining room.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said his wife, "except that Enna is not well enough to go\r\nout, and wants a fairy story to pass away the time, which Elsie alone\r\nis acquainted with, but is too lazy or too self-willed to relate."\r\n\r\nHe turned angrily to his little granddaughter.\r\n\r\n"Ah! indeed, is that it? Well, there is an old saying. \'A bird that\r\n_can_ sing, and _won\'t_ sing, must be _made_ to sing.\'"\r\n\r\nElsie was opening her lips to speak, but Mrs. Dinsmore bade her be\r\nsilent, and then went on. "She pretends it is all on account of\r\nconscientious scruples. \'It isn\'t fit for the Sabbath,\' she says. Now\r\n_I_ say it is a great piece of impertinence for a child of her years to\r\nset up her opinion against yours and mine; and I know very well it is\r\nnothing but an excuse, because she doesn\'t choose to be obliging."\r\n\r\n"Of _course_ it is; nothing in the _world_ but an excuse," responded\r\nMr. Dinsmore, hotly.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face flushed, and she answered a little indignantly,\r\n\r\n"No, grandpa, indeed it is _not_ merely an excuse, but--"\r\n\r\n"Do you _dare_ to contradict me, you impertinent little hussy?" cried\r\nthe old gentleman, interrupting her in the middle of her sentence; and\r\ncatching her by the arm, he shook her violently; then picking her up\r\nand setting her down hard upon a chair, he said, "Now, miss, sit you\r\nthere until your father comes home, then we will see what _he_ thinks\r\nof such impertinence; and if he doesn\'t give you the complete whipping\r\nyou deserve, I miss my guess."\r\n\r\n"Please, grandpa, I--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue! don\'t dare to speak another word until your father\r\ncomes home," said he, threateningly. "If you don\'t choose to say what\r\nyou\'re wanted to, you shall not talk at all."\r\n\r\nThen, going to the door, he called a servant and bade him tell "Mr.\r\nHorace," as soon as he returned, that he wished to see him.\r\n\r\nFor the next half-hour--and a very long one it seemed to her--Elsie sat\r\nthere wishing for, and yet dreading her father\'s coming. Would he\r\ninflict upon her the punishment which her grandfather evidently wished\r\nher to receive, without pausing to inquire into the merits of the case?\r\nor would he listen patiently to _her_ story? And even if he did, might\r\nhe not still think her deserving of punishment? She could not answer\r\nthese questions to her own satisfaction. A few months ago she would\r\nhave been certain of a very severe chastisement, and even now she\r\ntrembled with fear; for though she knew beyond a doubt that he loved\r\nher dearly, she knew also that he was a strict and severe\r\ndisciplinarian, and never excused her faults.\r\n\r\nAt last her ear caught the sound of his step in the hall, and her heart\r\nbeat fast and faster as it drew nearer, until he entered, and\r\naddressing his father, asked, "Did you wish to see me, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Horace, I want you to attend to this girl," replied the old\r\ngentleman, with a motion of the head toward Elsie. "She has been very\r\nimpertinent to me."\r\n\r\n"What! _Elsie_ impertinent! is it possible? I certainly expected better\r\nthings of her."\r\n\r\nHis tone expressed great surprise, and turning to his little daughter,\r\nhe regarded her with a grave, sad look that brought the tears to her\r\neyes; dearly as she loved him, it seemed almost harder to bear than the\r\nold expression of stern severity.\r\n\r\n"It is hard to believe," he said, "that my little Elsie would be guilty\r\nof such conduct; but if she has been, of course she must be punished,\r\nfor I cannot allow anything of the kind. Go. Elsie, to my dressing-room\r\nand remain there until I come to you."\r\n\r\n"Papa--" she began, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" he said, with something of the old sternness; "not a word; but\r\nobey me instantly."\r\n\r\nThen, as Elsie went sobbing from the room, he seated himself, and\r\nturning to his father, said, "Now, sir, if you please, I should like to\r\nhear the whole story; precisely what Elsie has done and said, and what\r\nwas the provocation; for _that_ must also be taken into the account, in\r\norder that I may be able to do her justice."\r\n\r\n"If you do her _justice_, you will whip her well," remarked his father\r\nin a tone of asperity.\r\n\r\nHorace colored violently, for nothing aroused his ire sooner than any\r\ninterference between him and his child; but controlling himself, he\r\nreplied quite calmly, "If I find her deserving of punishment, I will\r\nnot spare her; but I should be sorry indeed to punish her unjustly.\r\nWill you be so good as to tell me what she has done?"\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore referred him to his wife for the commencement of the\r\ntrouble, and she made out as bad a case against Elsie as possible; but\r\neven then there seemed to her father to be very little to condemn; and\r\nwhen Mrs. Dinsmore was obliged to acknowledge that it was Elsie\'s\r\nrefusal to humor Enna in her desire for a particular story which Elsie\r\nthought it not best to relate on the Sabbath, he bit his lip with\r\nvexation, and told her in a haughty tone, that though he did not\r\napprove of Elsie\'s strict notions regarding such matters, yet he wished\r\nher to understand that _his_ daughter was not to be made a slave to\r\nEnna\'s whims. If she _chose_ to tell her a story, or to do anything\r\nelse for her amusement, he had no objection, but she was never to be\r\n_forced_ to do it against her inclination, and Enna must understand\r\nthat it was done as a favor, and not at all as her right.\r\n\r\n"You are right enough there, Horace," remarked his father, "but that\r\ndoes not excuse Elsie for her impertinence to me. In the first place, I\r\nmust say I agree with my wife in thinking it quite a piece of\r\nimpertinence for a child of her years to set up her opinion against\r\nmine; and besides, she contradicted me flatly."\r\n\r\nHe then went on to repeat what he had said, and Elsie\'s denial of the\r\ncharge, using her exact words, but quite a different tone, and\r\nsuppressing the fact that he had interrupted her before she had\r\nfinished her sentence.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s tone, though slightly indignant, had still been respectful, but\r\nfrom her grandfather\'s rehearsal of the scene her father received the\r\nimpression that she had been exceedingly saucy, and he left the room\r\nwith the intention of giving her almost as severe a punishment as her\r\ngrandfather would have prescribed.\r\n\r\nOn the way up to his room, however, his anger had a little time to\r\ncool, and it occurred to him that it would be no more than just to hear\r\n_her_ side of the story ere he condemned her.\r\n\r\nElsie was seated on a couch at the far side of the room, and as he\r\nentered she turned on him a tearful, pleading look, that went straight\r\nto his heart.\r\n\r\nHis face was grave and sad, but there was very little sternness in it,\r\nas he sat down and took her in his arms.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he held her without speaking, while she lifted her eyes\r\ntimidly to his face. Then he said, as he gently stroked the hair back\r\nfrom her forehead, "I am very sorry, _very sorry indeed_, to hear so\r\nbad an account of my little daughter. I am afraid I shall have to\r\npunish her, and I don\'t like to do it."\r\n\r\nShe answered not a word, but burst into tears, and hiding her face on\r\nhis breast, sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\n"I will not condemn you unheard, Elsie," he said after a moment\'s\r\npause; "tell me how you came to be so impertinent to your grandfather."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to be saucy, papa, indeed I did not," she sobbed.\r\n\r\n"Stop crying then, daughter," he said kindly, "and tell me all about\r\nit. I know there was some trouble between you and Enna, and I want you\r\nto tell me all that occurred, and every word spoken by either of you,\r\nas well as all that passed between Mrs. Dinsmore, your grandfather, and\r\nyourself. I am very glad that I can trust my little girl to speak the\r\ntruth. I am quite sure she would not tell a falsehood even to save\r\nherself from punishment," he added tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear papa, for saying that," said Elsie, raising her head\r\nand almost smiling through her tears. "I will _try_ to tell it just as\r\nit happened."\r\n\r\nShe then told her story simply and truthfully, repeating, as he bade\r\nher, every word that had passed between Enna and herself, and between\r\nher and her grandparents. Her words to her grandfather sounded very\r\ndifferent, repeated in her quiet, respectful tones; and when she added\r\nthat if he would have allowed her, she was going on to explain that it\r\nwas not any unwillingness to oblige Enna, but the fear of doing wrong,\r\nthat led her to refuse her request, her father thought that after all\r\nshe deserved very little blame.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I was very saucy, papa?" she asked anxiously, when she\r\nhad finished her story.\r\n\r\n"So much depends upon the tone, Elsie," he said, "that I can hardly\r\ntell; if you used the same tone in speaking to your grandpa that you\r\ndid in repeating your words to me just now, I don\'t think it was _very_\r\nimpertinent; though the words themselves were not as respectful as they\r\nought to have been. You must always treat my father quite as\r\nrespectfully as you do me; and I think with him, too, that there is\r\nsomething quite impertinent in a little girl like you setting up her\r\nopinion against that of her elders. You must never try it with me, my\r\ndaughter."\r\n\r\nElsie hung down her head in silence for a moment, then asked in a\r\ntremulous tone, "Are you going to punish me, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "but first I am going to take you down-stairs and make\r\nyou beg your grandfather\'s pardon. I see you don\'t want to do it," he\r\nadded, looking keenly into her face, "but you _must_, and I hope I\r\nshall not be obliged to _enforce_ obedience to my commands."\r\n\r\n"I will do whatever you bid me, papa," she sobbed, "but I did not mean\r\nto be saucy. Please, papa, tell me what to say."\r\n\r\n"You must say, Grandpa, I did not intend to be impertinent to you, and\r\nI am very sorry for whatever may have seemed saucy in my words or\r\ntones; will you please to forgive me, and I will try always to be\r\nperfectly respectful in future. You can say all that with truth, I\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I _am_ sorry, and I _do_ intend to be respectful to grandpa\r\nalways," she answered, brushing away her tears, and putting her hand in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nHe then led her into her grandfather\'s presence, saying: "Elsie has\r\ncome to beg your pardon, sir."\r\n\r\n"That is as it should be," replied the old gentleman, glancing\r\ntriumphantly at his wife; "I told her you would not uphold her in any\r\nsuch impertinence."\r\n\r\n"No," said his son, with some displeasure in his tone; "I will neither\r\nuphold her in wrongdoing, nor suffer her to be imposed upon. Speak, my\r\ndaughter, and say what I bade you."\r\n\r\nElsie sobbed out the required words.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I must forgive you, of course," replied her grandfather, coldly,\r\n"but I hope your father is not going to let you off without proper\r\npunishment."\r\n\r\n"I will attend to that; I certainly intend to punish her _as she\r\ndeserves_" said his son, laying a marked emphasis upon the concluding\r\nwords of his sentence.\r\n\r\nElsie wholly misunderstood him, and so trembled with fear as he led her\r\nfrom the room, that she could scarcely walk; seeing which, he took her\r\nin his arms and carried her up-stairs, she sobbing on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak until he had locked the door, carried her across the\r\nroom, and seated himself upon the couch again, with her upon his knee.\r\n\r\nThen he said, in a soothing tone, as he wiped away her tears and kissed\r\nher kindly, "You need not tremble so, my daughter; I am not going to be\r\nsevere with you."\r\n\r\nShe looked up in glad surprise.\r\n\r\n"I said I would punish you as you _deserve_," he said, with a smile,\r\n"and I intend to keep you shut up here with me until bed-time, I shall\r\nnot allow you to go down-stairs to tea, and besides, I am going to give\r\nyou a long lesson to learn, which I shall require you to recite to me\r\nquite perfectly before you can go to bed."\r\n\r\nElsie grew frightened again at the mention of the lesson, for she\r\nfeared it might be something which she could not conscientiously study\r\non the Sabbath; but all her fear and trouble vanished as she saw her\r\nfather take up a Bible that lay on the table, and turn over the leaves\r\nas though selecting a passage.\r\n\r\nPresently he put it into her hands, and pointing to the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth chapters of John\'s Gospel, bade her carry the book to a low\r\nseat by the window, and sit there until she had learned them perfectly.\r\n\r\n"O papa! what a nice lesson!" she exclaimed, looking up delightedly\r\ninto his face; "but it won\'t be any punishment, because I love these\r\nchapters dearly, and have read them so often that I almost know every\r\nword already."\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush!" he said, pretending to be very stern; "don\'t tell me that\r\nmy punishments are _no_ punishments, I don\'t allow you to talk so; just\r\ntake the book and learn what I bid you; and if you know those two\r\nalready, you may learn the next."\r\n\r\nElsie laughed, kissed his hand, and tripped away to her window, while\r\nhe threw himself down on the couch and took up a newspaper, more as a\r\nscreen to his face, however, than for the purpose of reading; for he\r\nlay there closely watching his little daughter, as she sat in the rich\r\nglow of the sunset, with her sweet, grave little face bending over the\r\nholy book.\r\n\r\n"The darling!" he murmured to himself; "she is lovely as an angel, and\r\nshe is _mine_, mine only, mine own precious one; and loves me with her\r\nwhole soul. Ah! how can I ever find it in my heart to be stern to her?\r\nAh! if _I_ were but _half_ as good and pure as she is, I should be a\r\nbetter man than I am." And he heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour had passed, and still Elsie bent over her book. The\r\ntea-bell rang, and Mr. Dinsmore started up, and crossing the room, bent\r\ndown and stroked her hair.\r\n\r\n"Do you know it, darling?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Almost, papa," and she looked up into his face with a bright, sweet\r\nsmile, full of affection.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden impulse he caught her in his arms, and kissing her again\r\nand again, said with emotion, "Elsie, my darling, I love you _too_\r\nwell; I could never bear to lose you."\r\n\r\n"You must love Jesus better, my own precious papa," she replied,\r\nclasping her little arms around his neck, and returning his caresses.\r\n\r\nHe held her a moment, and then putting her down, said, "I shall send\r\nyou up some supper, and I want you to eat it; don\'t behave as you did\r\nabout the bread and water once, a good while ago."\r\n\r\n"Will it be bread and water this time, papa?" she asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"You will see," he said, laughingly, and quitted the room.\r\n\r\nElsie turned to her book again, but in a few moments was interrupted by\r\nthe entrance of a servant carrying on a silver waiter a plate of hot,\r\nbuttered muffins, a cup of jelly, another of hot coffee, and a piece of\r\nbroiled chicken. Elsie was all astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Why, Pomp," she asked, "did papa send it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Elsie, \'deed he did," replied the servant, with a grin of\r\nsatisfaction, as he set down his burden. "I reckon you been berry nice\r\ngal dis day; or else Marster Horace tink you little bit sick."\r\n\r\n"Papa is very good; and I am much obliged to you too, Pomp," said the\r\nlittle girl, laying aside her book, and seating herself before the\r\nwaiter.\r\n\r\n"Jes ring de bell, Miss Elsie, ef you want more, and dis chile fotch\r\n\'em up; Marster Horace say so hisself." And the grinning negro bowed\r\nhimself out, chuckling with delight, for Elsie had always been a great\r\nfavorite with him.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," Elsie said, when he came in again and smilingly asked if\r\nshe had eaten her prison fare, "what a good supper you sent me! But I\r\nthought you didn\'t allow me such things!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know," said he playfully, laying his hand upon her head,\r\n"that I am absolute monarch of this small kingdom, and you are not to\r\nquestion my doings or decrees?"\r\n\r\nThen in a more serious tone, "No, daughter, I do not allow it as a\r\nregular thing, because I do not think it for your good; but for once, I\r\nthought it would not hurt you. I know you are not one to presume upon\r\nfavors, and I wanted to indulge you a little, because I fear my little\r\ngirl has been made to suffer perhaps more than she quite deserved this\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\nHis voice had a very tender tone as he uttered the concluding words,\r\nand stooping, he pressed his lips to her forehead.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think, though," he added the next moment, "that I am excusing\r\nyou for impertinence, not at all; but it was what you have had to\r\nsuffer from Enna\'s insolence. I shall put a stop to that, for I will\r\nnot have it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind it much, papa," said Elsie gently, "I am quite used to\r\nit, for Enna has always treated me so."\r\n\r\n"And why did _I_ never hear of it before?" he asked, half angrily. "It\r\nis abominable! not to be endured!" he exclaimed, "and I shall see that\r\nMiss Enna is made to understand that _my_ daughter is fully her equal\r\nin every respect, and always to be treated as such."\r\n\r\nHe paused; but, Elsie, half frightened at his vehemence, made no reply;\r\nand he went on: "I have no  doubt your grandfather and his wife would\r\nhave been better pleased had I forced you to yield to Enna\'s whim; but\r\nI had no idea of such a thing; you shall use your own pleasure whenever\r\nshe is concerned; but: if _I_ had bidden you to  tell her that story it\r\nwould have been a very different matter; you need  never set up your\r\nwill, or your opinion of right and wrong, against mine, Elsie, for I\r\nshall not allow it. I don\'t altogether like some of those strict\r\nnotions you have got into your head, and I give you fair warning, that\r\nshould  they ever come into collision with _my_ wishes and commands,\r\nthey will have to be given up. But don\'t look so alarmed, daughter; I\r\nhope it may never happen; and we will say no more about it to-night,"\r\nhe added, kindly, for she had grown very pale and trembled visibly.\r\n\r\n"O papa, dear papa! don\'t ever bid me do anything wrong; it would break\r\nmy heart," she said, laying her head on his shoulder as he sat down and\r\ndrew her to his side.\r\n\r\n"I never intend to bid you do wrong, but, on the contrary, wish you\r\nalways to do right. But then, daughter, _I_ must be the judge of what\r\nis wrong or right for you; you must remember that you are only a very\r\nlittle girl, and not yet capable of judging for yourself, and all you\r\nhave to do is to obey your father without murmuring or hesitation, and\r\nthen there will be no trouble."\r\n\r\nHis tone, though mild, and not unkind, was very firm and decided, and\r\nElsie\'s heart sank; she seemed to feel herself in the shadow of some\r\ngreat trouble laid up in store for her in the future. But she strove,\r\nand ere long with success, to banish the foreboding of evil which\r\noppressed her, and give herself up to the enjoyment of present\r\nblessings. Her father loved her dearly--she knew that--and he was not\r\n_now_ requiring her to do aught against her conscience, and perhaps he\r\nnever might; he had said so himself, and God could incline his heart to\r\nrespect her scruples; or if, in His infinite wisdom, He saw that the\r\ndreaded trial was needed, He would give her strength to bear it; for\r\nhad He not promised, "As thy day, so shall thy strength be"?\r\n\r\nHer father\'s arm was around her, and she had been standing silently,\r\nwith her face hidden on his shoulder, while these thoughts were passing\r\nthrough her mind, and the little heart going up in prayer to God for\r\nhim and for herself.\r\n\r\n"What is my little girl thinking of?" he asked presently.\r\n\r\n"A good many things, papa," she said, raising her face, now quite\r\npeaceful and happy again. "I was thinking of what you had just been\r\nsaying to me, and that I am so glad I know that you love me dearly; and\r\nI was asking God to help us both to do His will, and that I might\r\nalways be able to do what you bid me, without disobeying Him," she\r\nadded simply; and then asked, "May I say my lesson now, papa? I think I\r\nknow it quite perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, in an absent way; "bring me the book."\r\n\r\nElsie brought it, and putting it into his hands, drew up a stool and\r\nsat down at his feet, resting her arm on his knee, and looking up into\r\nhis face; then in her sweet, low voice, she repeated slowly and\r\nfeelingly, with true and beautiful emphasis, the chapters he had given\r\nher to learn; that most touching description of the Last Supper, and\r\nour Saviour\'s farewell address to His sorrowing disciples.\r\n\r\n"Ah! papa, is it not beautiful?" she exclaimed, laying her head upon\r\nhis knee, while the tears trembled in her eyes. "Is not that a sweet\r\nverse, \'Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them\r\nunto the end\'? It seems so strange that He could be so thoughtful for\r\nthem, so kind and loving, when all the time He knew what a dreadful\r\ndeath He was just going to die; and knew besides that they were all\r\ngoing to run away and leave Him alone with His cruel enemies. Oh! it is\r\nso sweet to know that Jesus is so loving, and that He loves me, and\r\nwill always love me, even to the end, _forever_."\r\n\r\n"How do you know that, Elsie?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I know that He loves me, papa, because I love Him, and He has said, \'I\r\nlove them that love me;\' and I know that He will love me always,\r\nbecause He has said, \'I have loved thee with an _everlasting_ love,\'\r\nand in another place, \'I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.\'"\r\n\r\n"But do you think you are good enough, daughter, for Jesus to love you?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! papa, I know I am not at all good. I have a very wicked heart, and\r\noften my thoughts and feelings are all wrong, and Jesus knows all about\r\nit, but it does not keep Him from loving me, for you know it was\r\n_sinners_ He died to save. Ah! papa, how _good_ and _kind_ He was! Who\r\ncould help loving Him? I used to feel _so_ lonely and sad sometimes,\r\npapa, that I think my heart would have broken quite, and I should have\r\ndied, if I had not had Jesus to love me."\r\n\r\n"When were you so sad and lonely, darling?" he asked in a moved tone,\r\nas he laid his hand gently on her head, and stroked her hair\r\ncaressingly.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes when you were away, papa, and I had never seen you; but then\r\nI used to think of you, and my heart would long and _ache_ so to see\r\nyou, and hear you call me daughter, and to lay my head against your\r\nbreast and feel your arms folding me close to your heart, as you do so\r\noften now."\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, and struggled hard to keep down the rising sobs,\r\nas she added, "But when you came, papa, and I saw you did not love me,\r\noh! papa, that was the worst. I thought I could never, _never_ bear it.\r\nI thought my heart would break, and I wanted to die and go to Jesus,\r\nand to mamma."\r\n\r\nThe little frame shook with sobs.\r\n\r\n"My poor darling! my poor little pet!" he said, taking her in his arms\r\nagain, and caressing her with the greatest tenderness, "it was very\r\nhard, very cruel. I don\'t know how I could steel my heart so against my\r\nown little child; but I had been very much prejudiced, and led to\r\nsuppose that you looked upon me with fear and dislike, as a hated\r\ntyrant."\r\n\r\nElsie lifted her eyes to his face with a look of extreme surprise.\r\n\r\n"O papa!" she exclaimed, "how _could_ you think that? I have always\r\nloved you, ever since I can remember."\r\n\r\nWhen Elsie went to her room that evening she thought very seriously of\r\nall that had occurred during the afternoon, and all that her papa had\r\nsaid to her; and to her usual petitions was added a very fervent one\r\nthat he might never bid her break any command of God; or if he did,\r\nthat she might have strength given her according to her day.\r\n\r\nA shadow had fallen on her pathway, faint, but perceptible; a light,\r\nfleecy cloud obscured the brightness of her sun; yet it was not for\r\nsome weeks that even the most distant mutterings of the coming storm\r\ncould be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n    "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing\r\n    thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a Delight,\r\n    the Holy of the Lord, Honorable, and shalt honor him, not\r\n    doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor\r\n    speaking thine own words."\r\n                                 --_Isaiah_ Iviii. 13.\r\n\r\n    "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto\r\n    you, more than unto God, judge ye."\r\n                                 --_Acts_ iv. 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite a number of guests had dined at Roselands. They were nearly all\r\ngentlemen, and were now collected in the drawing-room, laughing,\r\njesting, talking politics, and conversing with each other and the\r\nladies upon various worldly topics, apparently quite forgetful that it\r\nwas the Lord\'s day, which He has commanded to be kept holy in thought\r\nand word, as well as deed.\r\n\r\n"May I ask what you are in search of, Mr. Eversham?" inquired Adelaide,\r\nas she noticed one of the guests glance around the room with a rather\r\ndisappointed air.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Adelaide; I was looking for little Miss Elsie. Travilla has\r\ngiven me so very glowing an account of her precocious musical talent,\r\nthat I have conceived a great desire to hear her play and sing."\r\n\r\n"Do you hear that, Horace?" asked Adelaide, turning to her brother.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I shall be most happy to gratify you, Eversham," replied the\r\nyoung father, with a proud smile.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the room to summon a servant, but as he placed his hand upon\r\nthe bell-rope, Mrs. Dinsmore arrested his movement.\r\n\r\n"Stay, Horace," she said; "you had better not send for her."\r\n\r\n"May I be permitted to ask _why_, madam?" he inquired in a tone of\r\nmingled surprise and annoyance.\r\n\r\n"Because she will not sing," answered the lady, coolly.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, madam, but I think she will, if _I bid_ her to do it," he\r\nsaid with flashing eyes.\r\n\r\n"No, she will not," persisted Mrs. Dinsmore, in the same cold, quiet\r\ntone; "she will tell you she is wiser than her father, and that it\r\nwould be a sin to obey him in this. Believe me, she will most assuredly\r\ndefy your authority; so you had better take my advice and let her\r\nalone--thus sparing yourself the mortification of exhibiting before\r\nyour guests your inability to govern your child."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore bit his lip with vexation.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he said, haughtily, "but I prefer convincing you that that\r\ninability lies wholly in your own imagination; and I am quite at a loss\r\nto understand upon what you found your opinion, as Elsie has never yet\r\nmade the very slightest resistance to my authority."\r\n\r\nHe had given the bell-rope a vigorous pull while speaking, and a\r\nservant now appearing in answer to the summons, he sent him with a\r\nmessage to Elsie, requiring her presence in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThen turning away from his step-mother, who looked after him with a\r\ngleam of triumph in her eye, he joined the group of gentlemen already\r\ngathered about the piano, where Adelaide had just taken her seat and\r\nbegun a brilliant overture.\r\n\r\nYet, outwardly calm and self-satisfied as his demeanor may have been,\r\nHorace Dinsmore was even now regretting the step he had just taken; for\r\nremembering Elsie\'s conscientious scruples regarding the observance of\r\nthe Sabbath--which he had for the moment forgotten--he foresaw that\r\nthere would be a struggle, probably a severe one; and though, having\r\nalways found her docile and yielding, he felt no doubt of the final\r\nresult, he would willingly have avoided the contest, could he have done\r\nso without a sacrifice of pride; but, as he said to himself, with a\r\nslight sigh, he had now gone too far to retreat; and then he had all\r\nalong felt that this struggle must come _some_ time, and perhaps it was\r\nas well now as at any other.\r\n\r\nElsie was alone in her own room, spending the Sabbath afternoon in her\r\nusual manner, when the servant came to say that her papa wished to see\r\nher in the drawing-room. The little girl was a good deal alarmed at the\r\nsummons, for the thought instantly flashed upon her, "He is going to\r\nbid me play and sing, or do something else which it is not right to do\r\non the Sabbath day."\r\n\r\nBut remembering that he never had done so, she hoped he might not now;\r\nyet ere she obeyed the call she knelt down for a moment, and prayed\r\nearnestly for strength to do right, however difficult it might be.\r\n\r\n"Come here, daughter," her father said as she entered the room. He\r\nspoke in his usual pleasant, affectionate tone, yet Elsie started,\r\ntrembled, and turned pale; for catching sight of the group at the\r\npiano, and her Aunt Adelaide just vacating the music-stool, she at once\r\nperceived what was in store for her.\r\n\r\n"Here, Elsie," said her father, selecting a song which she had learned\r\nduring their absence, and sang remarkably well, "I wish you to sing\r\nthis for my friends; they are anxious to hear it."\r\n\r\n"Will not to-morrow do, papa?" she asked in a low, tremulous tone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore, who had drawn near to listen, now looked at Horace with\r\na meaning smile, which he affected not to see.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, Elsie," he said; "we want it now. You know it quite\r\nwell enough without any more practice."\r\n\r\n"I did not want to wait for _that_ reason, papa," she replied in the\r\nsame low, trembling tones, "but you know this is the holy Sabbath day."\r\n\r\n"Well, my daughter, and what of that? _I_ consider this song perfectly\r\nproper to be sung to-day, and that ought to satisfy you that you will\r\nnot be doing wrong to sing it; remember what I said to you some weeks\r\nago; and now sit down and sing it at once, without any more ado."\r\n\r\n"O papa! I _cannot_ sing it to-day; _please_ let me wait until\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Elsie," he said in his sternest tones, "sit down to the piano\r\ninstantly, and do as I bid you, and let me hear no more of this\r\nnonsense."\r\n\r\nShe sat down, but raising her pleading eyes, brimful of tears to his\r\nface, she repeated her refusal. "Dear papa, I _cannot_ sing it to-day.\r\nI _cannot_ break the Sabbath."\r\n\r\n"Elsie, you _must_ sing it," said he, placing the music before her. "I\r\nhave told you that it will not be breaking the Sabbath, and that is\r\nsufficient; you must let me judge for you in these matters."\r\n\r\n"Let her wait until to-morrow, Dinsmore; tomorrow will suit us quite as\r\nwell," urged several of the gentlemen, while Adelaide good-naturedly\r\nsaid, "Let me play it, Horace; I have no such scruples, and presume I\r\ncan do it nearly as well as Elsie."\r\n\r\n"No," he replied, "when I give my child a command, it is to be obeyed;\r\nI have _said_ she should play it, and play it she _must_; she is not to\r\nsuppose that she may set up her opinion of right and wrong against\r\nmine."\r\n\r\nElsie sat with her little hands folded in her lap, the tears streaming\r\nfrom her downcast eyes over her pale cheeks. She was trembling, but\r\nthough there was no stubbornness in her countenance, the expression\r\nmeek and humble, she made no movement toward obeying her father\'s order.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silent waiting; then he said in his severest\r\ntone, "Elsie, you shall sit there till you obey me, though it should be\r\nuntil to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she replied in a scarcely audible voice, and they all\r\nturned away and left her.\r\n\r\n"You see now that you had better have taken my advice, Horace,"\r\nremarked Mrs. Dinsmore, in a triumphant aside; "I knew very well how it\r\nwould end."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said he, "but it has _not_ ended; and ere it does, I think\r\nshe will learn that she has a stronger will than her own to deal with."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s position was a most uncomfortable one; her seat high and\r\nuneasy, and seeming to grow more and more so as the weary moments\r\npassed slowly away. No one came near her or seemed to notice her, yet\r\nshe could hear them conversing in other parts of the room, and knew\r\nthat they were sometimes looking at her, and, timid and bashful as she\r\nwas, it seemed hard to bear. Then, too, her little heart was very sad\r\nas she thought of her father\'s displeasure, and feared that he would\r\nwithdraw from her the affection which had been for the last few months\r\nthe very sunshine of her life. Besides all this, the excitement of her\r\nfeelings, and the close and sultry air--for it was a very warm day--had\r\nbrought on a nervous headache. She leaned forward and rested her head\r\nagainst the instrument, feeling in momentary danger of falling from her\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThus two long hours had passed when Mr. Travilla came to her side, and\r\nsaid in a compassionate tone, "I am really very sorry for you, my\r\nlittle friend; but I advise you to submit to your papa. I see you are\r\ngetting very weary sitting there, and I warn you not to hope to conquer\r\nhim. I have known him for years, and a more determined person I never\r\nsaw. Had you not better sing the song? it will not take five minutes,\r\nand then your trouble will be all over."\r\n\r\nElsie raised her head, and answered gently, "Thank you for your\r\nsympathy, Mr. Travilla, you are very kind; but I could not do it,\r\nbecause Jesus says, \'He that loveth father or mother more than me, is\r\nnot worthy of me;\' and I cannot disobey Him, even to please my own dear\r\npapa."\r\n\r\n"But, Miss Elsie, why do you think it would be disobeying Him? Is there\r\nany verse in the Bible which says you must not sing songs on Sunday?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Travilla, it says the Sabbath is to be kept holy unto the Lord;\r\nthat we are not to think our own thoughts, nor speak our own words, nor\r\ndo our own actions; but all the day must be spent in studying God\'s\r\nword, or worshipping and praising Him; and there is no praise in that\r\nsong; not one word about God or heaven."\r\n\r\n"That is very true, Elsie, but still it is such a _very little_ thing,\r\nthat I cannot think there would be much harm in it, or that God would\r\nbe very angry with you for doing it."\r\n\r\n"O Mr. Travilla!" she said, looking up at him in great surprise,\r\n"surely you know that there is no such thing as a _little sin_; and\r\ndon\'t you remember about the man who picked up sticks on the Sabbath\r\nday?"\r\n\r\n"No; what was it?"\r\n\r\n"God commanded that he should be stoned to death, and it was done.\r\nWould you not have thought _that_ a very little thing, Mr. Travilla?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe I should," said he, turning away with a very grave face.\r\n\r\n"Dinsmore," he said, going up to his friend; "I am sure that child is\r\nconscientious; had you not better give up to her in this instance?"\r\n\r\n"_Never_, Travilla," he answered, with stern decision. "This is the\r\nfirst time she has rebelled against my authority, and if I let her\r\nconquer now, she will think she is always to have her own way. No; cost\r\nwhat it may, I _must_ subdue her; she will have to learn that my will\r\nis law."\r\n\r\n"Right, Horace," said the elder Mr. Dinsmore, approvingly, "let her\r\nunderstand from the first that you are to be master; it is always the\r\nbest plan."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Dinsmore," said Travilla; "but I must say that I think a\r\nparent has no right to coerce a child into doing violence to its\r\nconscience."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" replied his friend, a little angrily. "Elsie is entirely\r\ntoo young to set up her opinion against mine; she must allow me to\r\njudge for her in these matters for some years to come."\r\n\r\nEversham, who had been casting uneasy glances at Elsie all the\r\nafternoon, now drawing his chair near to Adelaide, said to her in an\r\nundertone, "Miss Adelaide, I am deeply sorry for the mischief I have\r\nunwittingly caused, and if you can tell me how to repair it you will\r\nlay me under lasting obligations."\r\n\r\nAdelaide shook her head. "There is no moving Horace when he has once\r\nset his foot down," she said; "and as to Elsie, I doubt whether any\r\npower on earth can make her do what she considers wrong."\r\n\r\n"Poor little thing!" said Eversham, sighing; "where in the world did\r\nshe get such odd notions?"\r\n\r\n"Partly from a pious Scotch woman, who had a good deal to do with her\r\nin her infancy, and partly from studying the Bible, I believe. She is\r\nalways at it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" and he relapsed into thoughtful silence.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed slowly away, and then the tea-bell rang.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," asked her father, coming to her side, "are you ready to obey\r\nme now? if so, we will wait a moment to hear the song, and then you can\r\ngo to your tea with us."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, I cannot break the Sabbath," she replied, in a low, gentle\r\ntone, without lifting her head.\r\n\r\n"Very well then, I cannot break my word; you must sit there until you\r\nwill submit; and until then you must fast. You are not only making\r\nyourself miserable by your disobedience and obstinacy, Elsie, but are\r\nmortifying and grieving _me_ very much," he added in a subdued tone,\r\nthat sent a sharp pang to the loving little heart, and caused some very\r\nbitter tears to fall, as he turned away and left her.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed wearily away to the little girl; the drawing-room\r\nwas but dimly lighted, for the company had all deserted it to wander\r\nabout the grounds, or sit in the portico enjoying the moonlight and the\r\npleasant evening breeze, and the air indoors seemed insupportably close\r\nand sultry. At times Elsie could scarcely breathe, and she longed\r\nintensely to get out into the open air; every moment her seat grew more\r\nuncomfortable and the pain in her head more severe: her thoughts began\r\nto wander, she forgot where she was, everything became confused, and at\r\nlength she lost all consciousness.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen, among whom were Mr. Horace Dinsmore and Mr.\r\nTravilla, were conversing together on the portico, when they were\r\nsuddenly startled by a sound as of something falling.\r\n\r\nTravilla, who was nearest the door, rushed into the drawing-room,\r\nfollowed by the others.\r\n\r\n"A light! quick, quick, a light!" he cried, raising Elsie\'s insensible\r\nform in his arms; "the child has fainted."\r\n\r\nOne of the others, instantly snatching a lamp from a distant table,\r\nbrought it near, and the increased light showed Elsie\'s little face,\r\nghastly as that of a corpse, while a stream of blood was flowing from a\r\nwound in the temple, made by striking against some sharp corner of the\r\nfurniture as she fell.\r\n\r\nShe was a pitiable sight indeed, with her fair face, her curls, and her\r\nwhite dress all dabbled in blood.\r\n\r\n"Dinsmore, you\'re a brute!" exclaimed Travilla indignantly, as he\r\nplaced her gently on a sofa.\r\n\r\nHorace made no reply, but, with a face almost as pale as her own, bent\r\nover his little daughter in speechless alarm, while one of the guests,\r\nwho happened to be a physician, hastily dressed the wound, and then\r\napplied restoratives.\r\n\r\nIt was some time ere consciousness returned, and the father trembled\r\nwith the agonizing fear that the gentle spirit had taken its flight.\r\n\r\nBut at length the soft eyes unclosed, and gazing with a troubled look\r\ninto his face, bent so anxiously over her, she asked, "Dear papa, are\r\nyou angry with me?"\r\n\r\n"No, darling," he replied in tones made tremulous with emotion, "not at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"What was it?" she asked in a bewildered way; "what did I do? what has\r\nhappened?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, daughter," he said, "you have been ill; but you are better\r\nnow, so don\'t think any more about it."\r\n\r\n"She had better be put to bed at once," said the physician.\r\n\r\n"There is blood on my dress," cried Elsie, in a startled tone; "where\r\ndid it come from?"\r\n\r\n"You fell and hurt your head," replied her father, raising her gently\r\nin his arms; "but don\'t talk any more now."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I remember," she moaned, an expression of keen distress coming\r\nover her face; "papa--"\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush! not a word more; we will let the past go," he said,\r\nkissing her lips. "I shall carry you to your room now, and see you put\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\nHe held her on his knee, her head resting on his shoulder, while Chloe\r\nprepared her for rest.\r\n\r\n"Are you hungry, daughter?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, papa; I only want to go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"There, Aunt Chloe, that will do," he said, as the old nurse tied on\r\nthe child\'s night-cap; and raising her again in his arms, he carried\r\nher to the bed and was about to place her on it.\r\n\r\n"Oh papa! my prayers first, you know," she cried eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Never mind them to-night," said he, "you are not able."\r\n\r\n"Please let me, dear papa," she pleaded; "I cannot go to sleep without."\r\n\r\nYielding to her entreaties, he placed her on her knees, and stood\r\nbeside her, listening to her murmured petitions, in which he more than\r\nonce heard his own name coupled with a request that he might be made to\r\nlove Jesus.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished, he again raised her in his arms, kissed her\r\ntenderly several times, and then laid her carefully on the bed, saying,\r\nas he did so, "Why did you ask, Elsie, that I might love Jesus?"\r\n\r\n"Because, papa, I do so want you to love Him; it would make you so\r\nhappy; and besides, you cannot go to heaven without it; the Bible says\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Does it? and what makes you think I don\'t love Him?"\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, please don\'t be angry," she pleaded, tearfully, "but you\r\nknow Jesus says, \'He that keepeth my commandments, he it is that loveth\r\nme.\'"\r\n\r\nHe stooped over her. "Good night, daughter," he said.\r\n\r\n"Dear, _dear_ papa," she cried, throwing her arm round his neck, and\r\ndrawing down his face close to hers, "I do love you so very, _very_\r\nmuch!"\r\n\r\n"Better than anybody else?" he asked\r\n\r\n"No, papa, I love Jesus best; you next."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her again, and with a half sigh turned away and left the\r\nroom. He was not entirely pleased; not quite willing that she should\r\nlove even her Saviour better than himself.\r\n\r\nElsie was very weary, and was soon asleep. She waked the next morning\r\nfeeling nearly as well as usual, and after she had had her bath and\r\nbeen dressed by Chloe\'s careful hands, the curls being arranged to\r\nconceal the plaster that covered the wound on her temple, there was\r\nnothing in her appearance, except a slight paleness, to remind her\r\nfriends of the last night\'s accident.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting reading her morning chapter when her father came in,\r\nand taking a seat by her side, lifted her to his knee, saying, as he\r\ncaressed her tenderly, "My little daughter is looking pretty well this\r\nmorning; how does she feel?"\r\n\r\n"Quite well, thank you, papa," she replied, looking up into his face\r\nwith a sweet, loving smile.\r\n\r\nHe raised the curls to look at the wounded temple; then, as he dropped\r\nthem again, he said, with a shudder, "Elsie, do you know that you were\r\nvery near being killed last night?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, was I?" she asked with an awe-struck countenance.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the doctor says if that wound had been made half an inch nearer\r\nyour eye--I should have been childless."\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled almost too much for utterance as he finished his\r\nsentence, and he strained her to his heart with a deep sigh of\r\nthankfulness for her escape.\r\n\r\nElsie was very quiet for some moments, and the little face was almost\r\nsad in its deep thoughtfulness.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of, darling?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to his face and he saw that they were brimful of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"O papa!" she said, dropping her head on his breast while the bright\r\ndrops fell like rain down her cheeks, "would you have been so very\r\nsorry?"\r\n\r\n"Sorry, darling! do you not know that you are more precious to me than\r\nall my wealth, all my friends and relatives put together? Yes, I would\r\nrather part with everything else than lose this one little girl," he\r\nsaid, kissing her again and again.\r\n\r\n"Dear, _dear_ papa! how glad I am that you love me so much!" she\r\nreplied; and then relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nHe watched her changing countenance for some time, then asked, "What is\r\nit, darling?"\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking," she said, "whether I was ready to go to heaven,\r\nand I believe I was; for I know that I love Jesus; and then I was\r\nthinking how glad mamma would have been to see me; don\'t you think she\r\nwould, papa?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t spare you to her yet," he replied with emotion, "and I think\r\nshe loves me too well to wish it."\r\n\r\nAs Miss Day had not yet returned, Elsie\'s time was still pretty much at\r\nher own disposal, excepting when her papa gave her something to do; so,\r\nafter breakfast, finding that he was engaged with some one in the\r\nlibrary, she took her Bible, and seeking out a shady retreat in the\r\ngarden, sat down to read.\r\n\r\nThe Bible was ever the book of books to her, and this morning the\r\nsolemn, tender feelings naturally caused by the discovery of her recent\r\nnarrow escape from sudden death made it even more than usually touching\r\nand beautiful in her eyes. She had been alone in the arbor for some\r\ntime, when, hearing a step at her side, she looked up, showing a face\r\nall wet with tears.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Travilla who stood beside her.\r\n\r\n"In tears, little Elsie! Pray, what may the book be that effects you\r\nso?" he asked, sitting down by her side and taking it from her hand.\r\n"The Bible, I declare!" he exclaimed in surprise. "What can there be in\r\nit that you find so affecting?"\r\n\r\n"O Mr. Travilla!" said the little girl, "does it not make your heart\r\nache to read how the Jews abused our dear, dear Saviour? and then to\r\nthink that it was all because of our sins," she sobbed.\r\n\r\nHe looked half distressed, half puzzled; it seemed a new idea to him.\r\n\r\n"Really, my little Elsie," he said, "you are quite original in your\r\nideas, I suppose I _ought_ to feel unhappy about these things, but\r\nindeed the truth is, I have never thought much about them."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t love Jesus," she answered, mournfully. "Ah! Mr.\r\nTravilla, how sorry I am."\r\n\r\n"Why, Elsie, what difference can it make to you whether I love Him or\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Because, Mr. Travilla, the Bible says, \'If any man love not the Lord\r\nJesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha,\' accursed from God. Oh!\r\nsir, think how dreadful! You cannot be _saved_ unless you love Jesus,\r\nand believe on Him. \'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt\r\nbe saved.\' That is what God says in his word."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with deep solemnity, the tears trembling in her eyes. He was\r\ntouched, but for a while sat perfectly silent.\r\n\r\nThen he said, with an effort to speak lightly. "Ah, well, my little\r\nfriend, I certainly intend to repent and believe before I die, but\r\nthere is time enough yet."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Travilla," she said, laying her hand on his arm and looking\r\nearnestly into his face, "how do you know that there is time enough\r\nyet? _don\'t_ put it off, I beg of you."\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment; then asked, "Do you know, Mr. Travilla, how near I\r\ncame to being killed last night?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Well, suppose I had been killed, and had not loved Jesus; where would\r\nI be now?"\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her, and giving her a kiss, said, "I don\'t think\r\nyou would have been in any very bad place, Elsie; a sweet, amiable\r\nlittle girl, who has never harmed any one, would surely not fare very\r\nbadly in another world."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head very gravely.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Mr. Travilla, you forget the anathema, maranatha; if I had not\r\nloved Jesus, and had my sins washed away in His blood, I could not have\r\nbeen saved."\r\n\r\nJust at this moment a servant came to tell Elsie that her papa wanted\r\nher in the drawing-room, and Mr. Travilla, taking her hand, led her\r\ninto the house.\r\n\r\nThey found the company again grouped about the piano, listening to\r\nAdelaide\'s music.\r\n\r\nElsie went directly to her father and stood by his side, putting her\r\nhand in his with a gesture of confiding affection.\r\n\r\nHe smiled down at her, and kept fast hold of it until his sister had\r\nrisen from the instrument, when putting Elsie in her place, he said,\r\n"Now, my daughter, let us have that song."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she replied, beginning the prelude at once, "I will do my\r\nvery best."\r\n\r\nAnd so she did. The song was both well played and well sung, and her\r\nfather looked proud and happy as the gentlemen expressed their pleasure\r\nand asked for another and another.\r\n\r\nThus the clouds which had so suddenly obscured little Elsie\'s sky,\r\nseemed to have vanished as speedily as they had arisen.\r\n\r\nHer father again treated her with all his wonted affection, and there\r\neven seemed to be a depth of tenderness in his love which it had not\r\nknown before, for he could not forget how nearly he had lost her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank\r\n    thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid\r\n    these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed\r\n    them unto babes; even so, Father; for so it seemed good in\r\n    thy sight."\r\n                                 --_Luke_ x. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nSays the Apostle Paul, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my\r\nconscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great\r\nheaviness and continual sorrow in my heart, for I could wish that\r\nmyself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my kinsmen according\r\nto the flesh.... Brethren, my heart\'s desire and prayer to God for\r\nIsrael is, that they might be saved."\r\n\r\nAnd such, dear reader, is, in greater or less degree, the feeling of\r\nevery renewed heart; loving Jesus, it would fain have others love Him\r\ntoo; it desires the salvation of all; but for that of its own dear ones\r\nit longs and labors and prays; it is like Jacob wrestling with the\r\nangel, when he said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me."\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was with Elsie. She knew now that her father was not a\r\nChristian; that he had no real love for Jesus, none of the true fear of\r\nGod before his eyes. She saw that if he permitted her to read to him\r\nfrom God\'s word, as he sometimes did, it was not that he felt any\r\npleasure in listening, but only to please her; she had no reason to\r\nsuppose he ever prayed, and though he went regularly to church, it was\r\nbecause he considered it proper and respectable to do so, and not that\r\nhe cared to worship God, or to learn His will.\r\n\r\nThis conviction, which had gradually dawned upon Elsie, until now it\r\namounted to certainty, caused her great grief; she shed many tears over\r\nit in secret, and very many and very earnest were the prayers she\r\noffered up for her dear father\'s conversion.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on his knee one evening in the drawing-room, while he\r\nand several other gentlemen were conversing on the subject of religion.\r\nThey were discussing the question whether or no a change of heart were\r\nnecessary to salvation.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion seemed to be that it was not, and Elsie listened\r\nwith pain while her father expressed his decided conviction that all\r\nwho led an honest, upright, moral life, and attended to the outward\r\nobservances of religion, were quite safe.\r\n\r\n"He could see no necessity for a change of heart; he did not believe in\r\nthe doctrine of total depravity, not he; no indeed, he thought the\r\nworld much better than many people would have us believe."\r\n\r\nElsie fixed her eyes on his face with a very mournful gaze while he was\r\nspeaking, but he was busy with his argument and did not notice her.\r\n\r\nBut one of the guests was just expressing his approval of Mr.\r\nDinsmore\'s sentiments, when catching sight of Elsie\'s face, he stopped,\r\nremarking, "Your little girl looks as if she had something to say on\r\nthe subject; what is it, my dear?"\r\n\r\nElsie blushed, hesitated, and looked at her father.\r\n\r\n"Yes, speak, my daughter, if you have anything to say," he said\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\nElsie lifted her eyes timidly to the gentleman\'s face as she replied,\r\n"I was just thinking, sir, of what our Saviour said to Nicodemus:\r\n\'Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot\r\nsee the kingdom of God.\' \'Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be\r\nborn again.\'"\r\n\r\nShe repeated these words of inspiration with a deep, earnest solemnity\r\nthat seemed to impress every hearer.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was a deep hush in the room.\r\n\r\nThen the gentleman asked, "Well, my little lady, and what is meant by\r\nbeing born again?"\r\n\r\n"O sir!" she replied, "surely you know that it means to have the image\r\nof God, lost in Adam\'s fall, restored to us; it means what David asked\r\nfor when he prayed, \'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a\r\nright spirit within me.\'"\r\n\r\n"Where did you learn all this?" he asked, looking at her with mingled\r\nsurprise and admiration.\r\n\r\n"In the Bible, sir," she modestly replied.\r\n\r\n"You seem to have read it to some purpose," said he; "and now since you\r\nconsider that change so necessary, can you tell me how it is to be\r\nbrought about?"\r\n\r\n"God\'s Holy Spirit, alone, can change a sinner\'s heart, sir."\r\n\r\n"And how am I to secure His aid?" he asked.\r\n\r\nElsie answered with a text: "God is more willing to give His Holy\r\nSpirit to them that ask Him, than parents are to give good gifts unto\r\ntheir children."\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment; then asked, "Have you obtained this new heart, Miss\r\nElsie?"\r\n\r\n"I hope I have, sir," she replied, the sweet little face all suffused\r\nwith blushes, and the soft, downcast eyes filling with tears.\r\n\r\n"Why do you think so?" he asked again, "I think there is a text that\r\nsays you must be able always to give a reason for the hope that is in\r\nyou, or something to that effect, is there not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir: \'Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh\r\nyou a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.\'" Then\r\nraising her eyes to his face with a touching mixture of deep humility\r\nand holy boldness, she continued, "And this, sir is my answer: Jesus\r\nsays, \'Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out;\' and I\r\nbelieve Him. I did go to Him, and He did not cast me out, but forgave\r\nmy sins, and taught me to love Him and desire to serve Him all my life."\r\n\r\nThis conversation between the gentleman and the little girl had drawn\r\nthe attention of all present; and now Mrs. Dinsmore, who had more than\r\nonce shown signs of impatience, said, "Well, Elsie, I think you have\r\nnow talked quite enough for a child of your age." Then, pulling out her\r\nwatch, "It is high time for little folks to be in bed."\r\n\r\nElsie, blushing deeply, would have retired immediately, but her father\r\nheld her fast, saying, as he gave his stepmother an angry glance, "You\r\nneed not go, Elsie, unless you choose; I am quite capable of judging\r\nwhen it is time to send you to bed."\r\n\r\n"I would rather go, if you please, papa," whispered Elsie, who had a\r\ngreat dread of Mrs. Dinsmore\'s anger.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, you may do as you like," he replied, giving her a\r\ngood-night kiss. And with a graceful good-night to the company, the\r\nlittle girl left the room.\r\n\r\nHer questioner followed her with an admiring glance, then turning to\r\nher father, exclaimed warmly, "She is a _remarkably_ intelligent child,\r\nDinsmore! one that any father might be proud of. I was astonished at\r\nher answers."\r\n\r\n"Yes," remarked Travilla, "a text has been running in my head ever\r\nsince you commenced your conversation; something about these things\r\nbeing hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes. And," he\r\nadded, "I am sure if ever I saw one who possessed that new nature of\r\nwhich she spoke, it is she herself. Has she any faults, Dinsmore?"\r\n\r\n"Very few, _I_ think; though she would tell you a different story,"\r\nreplied her father with a gratified smile.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Elsie was sitting reading her Bible, when she suddenly\r\nfelt a hand laid on her head, and her father\'s voice said, "Good\r\nmorning, little daughter."\r\n\r\n"Ah! papa, is that you?" she asked, raising her head to give him a\r\nsmile of joyful welcome. "I did not know you were there."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I have been watching you for several minutes," he said; "always\r\nporing over the same book, Elsie; do you never tire of it?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, papa; it is always new, and I do love it so; it is so very\r\nsweet. May I read a little to you?" she added coaxingly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I love to listen to anything read by my darling," he said,\r\nsitting down and taking her on his knee.\r\n\r\nShe opened at the third chapter of John\'s Gospel and read it through.\r\nAt the sixteenth verse, "For God so loved the world, that He gave His\r\nonly begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,\r\nbut have everlasting life," she paused, and asked, "Was not that a\r\nwonderful gift, papa? and wonderful love that prompted it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, absently stroking her hair.\r\n\r\nShe finished the chapter, and closing the book, laid her head on his\r\nbreast, asking, "Dear papa, don\'t you believe the Bible?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, daughter; I am not an infidel," he replied in a careless\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, papa," she continued, half hesitatingly, "does not this\r\nchapter teach very plainly that we must love Jesus, and have new\r\nhearts, if we want to go to heaven?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "I dare say it does."\r\n\r\nThen taking the book from her, he laid it aside, and giving her a kiss,\r\nsaid, "I was much pleased with your intelligent answers to Mr. Lee,\r\nlast evening."\r\n\r\nElsie sighed, and her eyes filled with tears. It was not what she\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n"What an odd child you are!" he said, laughing. "You really look as\r\nthough I had been scolding, instead of praising you."\r\n\r\nShe dropped her head on his breast, and burst into tears and sobs.\r\n\r\n"Why, Elsie, my own darling, what ails you?" he asked in great surprise.\r\n\r\n"O papa!" she sobbed, "I want you to love Jesus."\r\n\r\n"Oh! is _that_ all?" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd setting her on her feet, he took her by the hand and led her out\r\ninto the garden, where they met Mr. Travilla and another gentleman, who\r\nimmediately entered into conversation with Mr. Dinsmore, while Elsie\r\nwandered about amongst the flowers and shrubs, gathering a nosegay for\r\nher Aunt Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELFTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "She had waited for their coming,\r\n      She had kiss\'d them o\'er and o\'er--\r\n    And they were so fondly treasured\r\n      For the words of love they bore,\r\n    Words that whispered in the silence,\r\n      She had listened till his tone\r\n    Seemed to linger in the echo\r\n      \'Darling, thou art all mine own!\'"\r\n                                 --MRS. J. C. NEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Pray, what weighty matter is troubling your young brain, birdie?"\r\nasked Adelaide, laughingly laying her hand on Elsie\'s shoulder.\r\n"Judging from the exceeding gravity of your countenance, one might\r\nimagine that the affairs of the nation had been committed to your care."\r\n\r\n"O auntie! can\'t you help me? won\'t you?" answered the little girl,\r\nlooking up coaxingly into the bright, cheerful face bent over her.\r\n\r\n"Help you in what? reading with your book upside down, eh?" asked\r\nAdelaide, pointing with a quizzical look at the volume of fairy tales\r\nin her little niece\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Elsie, coloring and laughing in her turn, "I was not\r\nreading, and did not know that my book was wrong side up. But, Aunt\r\nAdelaide, you know Christmas is coming soon, and I want to give papa\r\nsomething, and I am quite puzzled about it. I thought of slippers, but\r\nhe has a very handsome pair, and besides there would hardly be time to\r\nwork them, as I have so many lessons; a purse won\'t do either, because\r\nI have given him one already, and I would like it to be something worth\r\nmore than either slippers or purse. But you are so much wiser than I,\r\ncan\'t you help me think?"\r\n\r\n"So _this_ is what has kept you so quiet and demure all day that I have\r\nscarcely once heard you laugh or sing; quite an unusual state of things\r\nof late," and Adelaide playfully pinched the round, rosy cheek. "Ahem!\r\nlet me put on my thinking cap," assuming an air of comic gravity. "Ah!\r\nyes, I have it! your miniature, little one, of course; what could\r\nplease him better?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes," cried Elsie, clapping her hands, "that will do nicely; why\r\ndidn\'t I think of it? Thank you, auntie. But then," she added, her\r\ncountenance falling, "how can I get it taken without his knowledge? you\r\nknow the surprise is half the fun."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, my dear, I\'ll find a way to manage that," replied\r\nAdelaide, confidently; "so just run away with you now, and see how much\r\nmoney you can scrape together to spend on it."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t take long to count it," Elsie said with a merry laugh. "But\r\nhere is papa just coming in at the door; I hope he won\'t suspect what\r\nwe have been talking about," and she bounded away to meet him and claim\r\nthe kiss he never refused her now.\r\n\r\nOnce Adelaide would not have been surprised at Elsie\'s quietness.\r\nPatient and sweet tempered the little girl had always been, but more\r\nespecially after her father\'s return from Europe--very quiet and timid,\r\nseeming to shrink from observation, with a constant dread of incurring\r\nreproof or punishment; but the last few happy months, during which her\r\nfather had continued to lavish upon her every proof of the tenderest\r\naffection, had wrought a great change in her; her manner had lost its\r\ntimidity, she moved about the house with a light and joyous step, and\r\nit was no unusual thing to hear her merry, silvery laugh ring out, or\r\nher sweet voice carolling like some wild bird of the wood--the natural\r\noutgushings of her joy and thankfulness; for the little heart that had\r\nso long been famishing for love, that had often grown so weary and sick\r\nin its hungering and thirsting for it, was now fully satisfied, and\r\nrevelled in its new-found happiness.\r\n\r\n"I have got it all arranged nicely, Elsie," Adelaide said, coming into\r\nthe room with a very pleased face as the little girl was preparing for\r\nbed that evening. "Your papa is going away in a day or two to attend to\r\nsome business matters connected with your property, and will be absent\r\nat least two weeks; so, unless he should take it into his head to carry\r\nyou along, we can easily manage about the picture."\r\n\r\nElsie looked up with a countenance of blank dismay.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Adelaide, laughing, "I thought you\'d be delighted with my\r\nnews, and instead of that, you look as if I had read you your\r\ndeath-warrant."\r\n\r\n"O Aunt Adelaide! two whole weeks without seeing papa! just think how\r\nlong."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! nonsense, child! it will be gone before you know it. But now\r\ntell me, how much money have you?"\r\n\r\n"I have saved my allowance for two months; that makes twenty dollars,\r\nyou know, auntie, and I have a little change besides; do you think it\r\nwill be enough?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly, I\'m afraid; but I can lend you some, if necessary."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, auntie," Elsie answered gratefully, "you are very kind; but\r\nI couldn\'t take it, because papa has told me expressly that I must\r\nnever borrow money, nor run into debt in any way."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" exclaimed Adelaide, a little impatiently; "Horace certainly\r\nis the most absurdly strict person I ever met with. But never mind, I\r\nthink we can manage it somehow," she added, in a livelier tone, as she\r\nstooped to kiss her little niece good-night.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s gentle rap was heard very early at her papa\'s door the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHe opened it immediately, and springing into his arms, she asked,\r\nalmost tearfully, "Are you going away, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, darling," he said, caressing her fondly. "I must leave home for a\r\nfew weeks; and though I at first thought of taking you with me, upon\r\nfurther consideration I have decided that it will be better to leave\r\nyou here; yet, if you desire it very much, my pet, I will take you\r\nalong. Shall I?"\r\n\r\n"You know I would always rather be with you than anywhere else, papa,"\r\nshe answered, laying her head on his shoulder; "but you know best, and\r\nI am quite willing to do whatever you say."\r\n\r\n"That is right, daughter; my little Elsie is a good, obedient child,"\r\nhe said, pressing her closer to him.\r\n\r\n"When are you going papa?" she asked, her voice trembling a little.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, directly after dinner, daughter."\r\n\r\n"So soon," she sighed.\r\n\r\n"The sooner I leave you the sooner I shall return, you know, darling,"\r\nhe said, patting her cheek, and smiling kindly on her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; but two weeks seems such a long, long time."\r\n\r\nHe smiled. "At your age I suppose it does, but when you are as old as I\r\nam, you will think it very short. But to make it pass more quickly, you\r\nmay write me a little letter every day, and I will send you one just as\r\noften."\r\n\r\n"Oh! thank you, papa; that will be so pleasant," she answered, with a\r\nbrightening countenance. "I do so love to get letters, and I would\r\nrather have one from you than from anybody else."\r\n\r\n"Ah? then I think you ought to be willing to spare me for two weeks. I\r\nhave been thinking my little girl might perhaps be glad of a little\r\nextra pocket-money for buying Christmas gifts," he said, taking out his\r\npurse. "Would you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; oh! _very_ much, indeed."\r\n\r\nHe laughed at her eager tone, and putting a fifty-dollar note into her\r\nhand, asked, "Will that be enough?"\r\n\r\nElsie\'s eyes opened wide with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"I never before had half so much as this," she exclaimed. "May I spend\r\nit _all_, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Provided you don\'t throw it away," he answered gravely; "but don\'t\r\nforget that I require a strict account of all your expenditure."\r\n\r\n"Must I tell you _every_ thing I buy?" she asked, her countenance\r\nfalling considerably.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my child, you must; not until after Christmas, however, if you\r\nwould rather not."\r\n\r\n"I will not mind it so much then," she answered, looking quite\r\nrelieved; "but indeed, papa, it is a great deal of trouble."\r\n\r\n"Ah! my little girl must not be lazy," he said, shaking his head\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nThis was Elsie\'s first parting from her father since they had learned\r\nto know and love each other; and when the time came to say good-by, she\r\nclung to him, and seemed so loath to let him go, that he quite repented\r\nof his determination to leave her at home.\r\n\r\n"O papa, papa! I cannot bear to have you go, and leave me behind," she\r\nsobbed. "I feel as if you were never coming back."\r\n\r\n"Why, my own darling," he said, kissing her again and again, "why do\r\nyou talk so? I shall certainly be at home again in a fortnight; but if\r\nI had thought you would feel so badly, I would have made arrangements\r\nto take you with me. It is too late now, however, and you must let me\r\ngo, dearest. Be a good girl while I am gone, and when I return I will\r\nbring you some handsome presents."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he embraced her once more, then putting her gently from him,\r\nsprang into the carriage and was driven rapidly away.\r\n\r\nElsie stood watching until it was out of sight, and then ran away to\r\nher own room to put her arms round her nurse\'s neck and hide her tears\r\non her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Dere, dere, darlin\'! dat will do now. Massa Horace he be back \'fore\r\nlong, and ole Chloe don\' like for to see her chile \'stressin\' herself\r\nso," and the large, dusky hand was passed lovingly over the bright\r\ncurls, and tenderly wiped away the falling tears.\r\n\r\n"But, O mammy! I\'m afraid he will never come back. I\'m afraid the\r\nsteamboat boiler will burst, or the cars will run off the track, or----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, darlin\'! dat\'s wicked; you must jes\' trust de Lord to take\r\ncare of Massa Horace; He\'s jes\' as able to do it one place as in\r\ntudder; an ef you an\' your ole mammy keep prayin\' for Massa, I\'se\r\n_sure_ he\'ll come back safe, kase don\'t you remember what de good book\r\nsays, \'If any two of you agree----\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, dear mammy, thank you for remembering it," exclaimed the\r\nlittle girl, lifting her head and smiling through her tears. "I won\'t\r\ncry any more now, but will just try to keep thinking how glad I will be\r\nwhen papa comes home again."\r\n\r\n"A very sensible resolution, my dear," said Adelaide, putting her head\r\nin at the door; "so come, dry your eyes, and let mammy put on your\r\nbonnet and cloak as fast as possible, for I have begged a holiday for\r\nyou, and am going to carry you off to the city to do some shopping, et\r\ncetera."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I think I know what that et cetera means, auntie, don\'t I?"\r\nlaughed Elsie, as she hastened to obey.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! how very wise some people are," said her aunt, smiling and\r\nnodding good-naturedly. "But make haste, my dear, for the carriage is\r\nat the door."\r\n\r\nWhen Elsie laid her head upon her pillow that night she acknowledged to\r\nherself, that in spite of her father\'s absence--and she had, at times,\r\nmissed him sadly--the day had been a very short and pleasant one to\r\nher, owing to her Aunt Adelaide\'s thoughtful kindness in taking her out\r\ninto new scenes, and giving agreeable occupation to her thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe rose at her usual early hour the next morning, and though feeling\r\nlonely, comforted herself with the hope of receiving the promised\r\nletter; and her face was full of eager expectation, as her grandfather,\r\nin his usual leisurely manner, opened the bag and distributed its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n"Two letters for Elsie!" he said, in a tone of surprise, just as she\r\nwas beginning to despair of her turn coming at all. "Ah; one is from\r\nHorace, I see; and the other from Miss Allison, no doubt."\r\n\r\nElsie could hardly restrain her eagerness while he held them in his\r\nhand, examining and commenting upon the address, postmark, etc.\r\n\r\nBut at length he tossed them to her, remarking, "There! if you are done\r\nyour breakfast, you had better run away and read them."\r\n\r\n"Oh! thank you, grandpa," she said, gladly availing herself of his\r\npermission.\r\n\r\n"Elsie is fortunate to-day," observed Lora looking after her. "I wonder\r\nwhich she will read first."\r\n\r\n"Her father\'s, of course," replied Adelaide. "He is more to her than\r\nall the rest of the world put together."\r\n\r\n"A matter of small concern to the rest of the world, I opine," remarked\r\nMrs. Dinsmore, dryly.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so, mamma," said Adelaide, quietly; "yet I think there are\r\n_some_ who prize Elsie\'s affection."\r\n\r\nYes, Adelaide was right. Miss Rose\'s letter was neglected and almost\r\nforgotten, while Elsie read and reread her papa\'s with the greatest\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nIt gave an amusing account of the day\'s journey; but what constituted\r\nits chief charm for the little girl was that it was filled with\r\nexpressions of the tenderest affection for her.\r\n\r\nThen came the pleasant task of answering, which occupied almost all her\r\nspare time, for letter-writing was still, to her, a rather new and\r\ndifficult business, Miss Allison having hitherto been her only\r\ncorrespondent. And this was a pleasure which was renewed every day, for\r\nher papa faithfully kept his promise, each morning bringing her a\r\nletter, until at length one came announcing the speedy return of the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nElsie was almost wild with delight.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Adelaide," she cried, running to her to communicate the glad\r\ntidings, "papa says he will be here this very afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, as we have already attended to all the business that\r\nneeded to be kept secret from him, I am very glad to hear it,\r\nespecially for _your_ sake," replied Adelaide, looking up for a moment\r\nfrom the book she was reading, and then returning to it again, while\r\nher little niece danced out of the room, with her papa\'s letter still\r\nin her hand, and a face beaming with happiness.\r\n\r\nShe met Mrs. Dinsmore in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Why are you skipping about in that mad fashion, Elsie?" she asked,\r\nseverely; "I believe you will never learn to move and act like a lady."\r\n\r\n"I will try, madam, indeed," Elsie answered, subsiding into a slow and\r\nsteady gait which would not have disgraced a woman of any age; "but I\r\nwas so glad that papa is coming home to-day, that I could not help\r\nskipping."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" and with a scornful toss of the head, Mrs. Dinsmore sailed\r\npast her and entered the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nElsie had once, on her first arrival at Roselands, addressed Mrs.\r\nDinsmore, in the innocence of her heart, as "grandma," but that lady\'s\r\nhorrified look, and indignant repudiation of the ancient title, had\r\nmade a deep impression on the little girl\'s memory, and effectually\r\nprevented any repetition of the offence.\r\n\r\nAs the hour drew near when her father might reasonably be expected,\r\nElsie took her station at one of the drawing-room windows overlooking\r\nthe avenue, and the moment the carriage appeared in sight, she ran out\r\nand stood waiting for him on the steps of the portico.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore put out his head as they drove up the avenue, and the\r\nfirst object that caught his eye was the fairy-like form of his little\r\ndaughter, in her blue merino dress, and the golden brown curls waving\r\nin the wind. He sprang out and caught her in his arms the instant the\r\ncarriage stopped.\r\n\r\n"My darling, darling child," he cried, kissing her over and over again,\r\nand pressing her fondly to his heart, "how glad I am to have you in my\r\narms again!"\r\n\r\n"Papa, papa, my own dear, dear papa!" she exclaimed, throwing her arms\r\naround his neck, "I\'m _so_ happy, now that you have come home safe and\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"Are you, darling? but I must not keep you out in this wind, for it is\r\nquite chilly."\r\n\r\nHe set her down, and leaving the servant to attend lo his baggage, led\r\nher into the hall.\r\n\r\n"Will you come into the drawing-room, papa?" she said; "there is a\r\nbright, warm fire there."\r\n\r\n"Is there not one in my dressing-room?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, a very good one."\r\n\r\n"Then we will go there. I dare say the rest of the family are in no\r\ngreat hurry to see me, and I want my little girl to myself for half an\r\nhour," he said, leading the way up-stairs as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThey found, as Elsie had reported, a very bright fire in the\r\ndressing-room. A large easy chair was drawn up near it, and a handsome\r\ndressing-gown and slippers were placed ready for use; all the work of\r\nElsie\'s loving little hands.\r\n\r\nHe saw it all at a glance, and with a pleased smile, stooped and kissed\r\nher again, saying, "My dear little daughter is very thoughtful for her\r\npapa\'s comfort."\r\n\r\nThen exchanging his warm out-door apparel and heavy boots for the\r\ndressing-gown and slippers, he seated himself in the chair and took her\r\non his knee.\r\n\r\n"Well, daughter," he said, passing his hand caressingly over her curls,\r\n"papa has brought you a present; will you have it now, or shall it be\r\nkept for Christmas?"\r\n\r\n"Keep it for Christmas, papa," she answered gayly. "Christmas is almost\r\nhere, and besides, I don\'t want to look at anything but you to-night."\r\n\r\n"Very well, look at me as much as you like," was his laughing\r\nrejoinder. "And now tell me, have you been a good girl in my absence?"\r\n\r\n"As good as I ever am, I believe, papa. I tried very hard; but you can\r\nask Miss Day."\r\n\r\n"No, I am entirely satisfied with your report, for I know my little\r\ndaughter is quite truthful."\r\n\r\nElsie colored with pleasure, then calling to mind the time when he had\r\nfor a moment suspected her of falsehood, she heaved a deep sigh,\r\ndropping her head upon his breast.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to understand her thoughts, for, pressing his lips to her\r\nforehead, he said gently and kindly, "I think I shall never again doubt\r\nmy little daughter\'s truth."\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a grateful smile.\r\n\r\n"Miss Day has gone away to stay until after New Year\'s day, papa," she\r\nsaid, "and so our holidays have begun."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I am very well satisfied," said he. "I think you have earned a\r\nholiday, and I hope you will enjoy it. But I don\'t know that I shall\r\nlet _you_ play _all_ the time," he added with a smile; "I have some\r\nnotion of giving you a lesson now and then, myself."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, how pleasant!" she exclaimed delightedly; "I do so love to\r\nsay lessons to you."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, we will spend an hour together every morning. But are you\r\nnot to have some company?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, papa, quite a house full," she said with a slight sigh. "The\r\nPercys, and the Howards, and all the Carringtons, and some others too,\r\nI believe."\r\n\r\n"Why do you sigh, daughter?" he asked; "do you not expect to enjoy\r\ntheir company?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I hope so," she answered, rather dubiously; "but when there\r\nare so many, and they stay so long, they are apt to disagree, and that,\r\nyou know, is not pleasant. I am sure I shall enjoy the hour with you\r\nbetter than anything else; it is so sweet to be quite alone with my own\r\ndarling papa," and the little arm stole softly round his neck again,\r\nand the rosy lips touched his cheek.\r\n\r\n"Well, when are the little plagues coming?" he asked, returning her\r\ncaress.\r\n\r\n"Some of them to-morrow, papa; no, Monday--to-morrow is Sabbath day."\r\n\r\n"Shall I bring in de trunks now, massa?" asked Mr. Dinsmore\'s servant,\r\nputting his head in at the door.\r\n\r\n"Yes, John, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Why, you brought back a new one, papa, didn\'t you?" asked Elsie, as\r\nJohn carried in one she was sure she had never seen before, and in\r\nobedience to a motion of her father\'s hand, set it down quite near them.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, it is yours. There, John, unlock it," tossing him the\r\nkey. "And now, daughter, get down and see what you can find in it worth\r\nhaving."\r\n\r\nElsie needed no second bidding, but in an instant was on her knees\r\nbeside the trunk, eager to examine its contents.\r\n\r\n"Take the lid off the band-box first, and see what is there," said her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"O papa, how _very_ pretty!" she cried, as she lifted out a beautiful\r\nlittle velvet hat adorned with a couple of ostrich feathers.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad it pleases you, my darling," he said, putting it on her\r\nhead, and gazing at her with proud delight in her rare beauty. "There!\r\nit fits exactly, and is very becoming."\r\n\r\nThen taking it off, he returned it to the box, and bade her look\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n"I am reserving the present for Christmas," he said, in answer to her\r\ninquiring look.\r\n\r\nElsie turned to the trunk again.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, how good you are to me!" she said, looking up at him almost\r\nwith tears of pleasure in her eyes, as she lifted out, one after\r\nanother, a number of costly toys, which she examined with exclamations\r\nof delight, and then several handsome dresses, some of the finest,\r\nsoftest merino, and others of thick rich silk, all ready made in\r\nfashionable style, and doing credit to his taste and judgment; and\r\nlastly a beautiful velvet pelisse, trimmed with costly fur, just the\r\nthing to wear with her pretty new hat.\r\n\r\nHe laughed and patted her cheek.\r\n\r\n"We must have these dresses tried on," he said, "at least one of them;\r\nfor as they were all cut by the same pattern--one of your old dresses\r\nwhich I took with me--I presume they will all fit alike. There, take\r\nthis one to mammy, and tell her to put it on you, and then come back to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I wondered how you could get them the right size, papa," Elsie\r\nanswered, as she skipped gayly out of the room.\r\n\r\nShe was back again in a very few moments, arrayed in the pretty silk he\r\nhad selected.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it seems to be a perfect fit," said he, turning her round and\r\nround, with a very gratified look.\r\n\r\n"Mammy must dress you to-morrow in one of these new frocks, and your\r\npretty hat and pelisse."\r\n\r\nElsie looked troubled.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I shall be thinking of them in church, papa, if I wear\r\nthem then for the first time."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! nonsense! what harm if you do? This squeamishness, Elsie, is the\r\none thing about you that displeases me very much. But there! don\'t look\r\nso distressed, my pet. I dare say you will get over it by-and-by, and\r\nbe all I wish; indeed I sometimes think you have improved a little\r\nalready, in that respect."\r\n\r\nOh! what a pang these words sent to her heart! was it indeed true that\r\nshe was losing her tenderness of conscience? that she was becoming less\r\nafraid of displeasing and dishonoring her Saviour than in former days?\r\nThe very thought was anguish.\r\n\r\nHer head drooped upon her bosom, and the small white hands were clasped\r\nconvulsively together, while a bitter, repenting cry, a silent earnest\r\nprayer for pardon and help went up to Him whose ear is ever open to the\r\ncry of His children.\r\n\r\nHer father looked at her in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"What is it, darling?" he asked, drawing her tenderly toward him, and\r\npushing back the curls from her face; "why do you look so pained? what\r\ndid I say that could have hurt you so? I did not mean to be harsh and\r\nsevere, for it was a very trifling fault."\r\n\r\nShe hid her face on his shoulder and burst into an agony of tears.\r\n\r\n"It was not that, papa, but--but----"\r\n\r\n"But what, my darling? don\'t be afraid to tell me," he answered,\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\n"O papa! I--I am afraid I don\'t--love Jesus--as much as I did," she\r\nfaltered out between her sobs.\r\n\r\n"Ah! _that_ is it, eh? Well, well, you needn\'t cry any more. _I_ think\r\nyou are a very good little girl, though rather a silly one, I am\r\nafraid, and quite too morbidly conscientious."\r\n\r\nHe took her on his knee as he spoke, wiped away her tears, and then\r\nbegan talking in a lively strain of something else.\r\n\r\nElsie listened, and answered him cheerfully, but all the evening he\r\nnoticed that whenever she was quiet, an unusual expression of sadness\r\nwould steal over her face.\r\n\r\n"What a strange child she is!" he said to himself, as he sat musing\r\nover the fire, after sending her to bed. "I cannot understand her; it\r\nis very odd how often I wound, when I intend to please her."\r\n\r\nAs for Elsie, she scarcely thought of her new finery, so troubled was\r\nher tender conscience, so pained her little heart to think that she had\r\nbeen wandering from her dear Saviour.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie had learned that "if any man sin, we have an advocate with\r\nthe Father, Jesus Christ the righteous," and to Him she went with her\r\nsin and sorrow; she applied anew to the pardoning, peace-speaking blood\r\nof Christ--that "blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than\r\nthat of Abel;" and thus the sting of conscience was taken away and her\r\npeace restored, and she was soon resting quietly on her pillow, for,\r\n"so He giveth His beloved sleep."\r\n\r\nEven her father\'s keen, searching glance, when she came to him in the\r\nmorning, could discover no trace of sadness in her face; very quiet and\r\nsober it was, but entirely peaceful and happy, and so it remained all\r\nthrough the day. Her new clothes did not trouble her; she was hardly\r\nconscious of wearing them, and quite able to give her usual solemn and\r\nfixed attention to the services of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going, daughter?" Mr. Dinsmore asked, as Elsie gently\r\nwithdrew her hand from his on leaving the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"To my room, papa," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Come with me," he said; "I want you."\r\n\r\n"What do you want me for, papa?" she asked, as he sat down and took her\r\non his knee.\r\n\r\n"What for? why to keep, to love, and to look at," he said laughing. "I\r\nhave been away from my little girl so long, that now I want her close\r\nby my side, or on my knee, all the time. Do you not like to be with me?"\r\n\r\n"_Dearly_ well, my own darling papa," she answered, flinging her little\r\narms around his neck, and laying her head on his breast.\r\n\r\nHe fondled her, and chatted with her for some time, then, still keeping\r\nher on his knee, took up a book and began to read.\r\n\r\nElsie saw with pain that it was a novel and longed to beg him to put it\r\naway, and spend the precious hours of the holy Sabbath in the study of\r\nGod\'s word, or some of the lesser helps to Zion\'s pilgrims which the\r\nsaints of our own or other ages have prepared. But she knew that it\r\nwould be quite out of place for a little child like her to attempt to\r\ncounsel or reprove her father; and that, tenderly as he loved and\r\ncherished her, he would never for one moment allow her to forget their\r\nrelative positions.\r\n\r\nAt length she ventured to ask softly, "Papa, may I go to my own room\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"What for?" he asked; "are you tired of my company?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, _oh! no;_ but I want--" she hesitated and hung her head for\r\nan instant, while the rich color mounted to cheek and brow; then\r\nraising it again, she said fearlessly, "I always want to spend a little\r\nwhile with my best Friend on Sabbath afternoon, papa."\r\n\r\nHe looked puzzled, and also somewhat displeased.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you, Elsie," he said; "you surely can have no\r\nbetter friend than your own father; and can it be _possible_ that you\r\nlove any one else better than you love me?"\r\n\r\nAgain the little arms were round his neck, and hugging him close and\r\ncloser, she whispered, "It was Jesus I meant, papa; you know He loves\r\nme even better than you do, and I must love Him best of all; but there\r\nis no one else that I love half so much as I love you, my own dear,\r\ndear precious father."\r\n\r\n"Well, you may go; but only for a little while, mind," he answered,\r\ngiving her a kiss, and setting her down. "Nay," he added hastily, "stay\r\nas long as you like; if you feel it a punishment to be kept here with\r\nme, I would rather do without you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no, papa," she said beseechingly, and with tears in her eyes;\r\n"I do so love to be with you. Please don\'t be angry; please let me come\r\nback soon."\r\n\r\n"No, darling, I am not angry," he answered, smoothing her hair and\r\nsmiling kindly on her; "come back just when you like, and the sooner\r\nthe better."\r\n\r\nElsie did not stay away very long; in less than an hour she returned,\r\nbringing her Bible and "Pilgrim\'s Progress" with her.\r\n\r\nHer father welcomed her with a smile, and then turned to his novel\r\nagain, while she drew a stool to his side, and, sitting down, leaned\r\nher head against his knee, and read until the short winter day began to\r\nclose in, and Mr. Dinsmore, whose hand had been every now and then laid\r\ncaressingly upon her curls, said, "Put away your book now, daughter; it\r\nis growing too dark for you to read without straining your eyes."\r\n\r\n"Please, papa, let me finish the paragraph first; may I?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No; you must always obey the instant I speak to you."\r\n\r\nElsie rose at once, and without another word laid her books upon the\r\ntable; then coming back, claimed her accustomed place upon his knee,\r\nwith her head resting on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm around her, and they sat silently thus for some moments.\r\nAt length Elsie asked, "Papa, did you ever read \'Pilgrim\'s Progress!\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes; a good while ago, when I was quite a boy."\r\n\r\n"And you did not like it, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, very much, though I have nearly forgotten the story now. Do _you_\r\nlike it?"\r\n\r\n"Very much, indeed, papa; I think it comes next to the Bible."\r\n\r\n"Next to the Bible, eh? well, I believe you are the only little girl of\r\nmy acquaintance who thinks _that_ the most beautiful and interesting\r\nbook in the world. But, let me see, what is this \'Pilgrim\'s Progress\'\r\nabout? some foolish story of a man with a great load on his back; is it\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Foolish! papa; oh! I am sure you don\'t mean it; you couldn\'t think it\r\nfoolish. Ah! I know by your smile that you are only saying it to tease\r\nme. It is a beautiful story, papa, about Christian: how he lived in the\r\nCity of Destruction, and had a great burden on his back, which he tried\r\nin every way to get rid of, but all in vain, until he came to the\r\nCross; but then it seemed suddenly to loosen of itself, and dropped\r\nfrom his back, and rolled away, and fell into the sepulchre, where it\r\ncould not be seen any more."\r\n\r\n"Well, and is not _that_ a foolish story? can you see any sense or\r\nmeaning in it?" he asked, with a slight smile, and a keen glance into\r\nthe eager little face upturned to his.\r\n\r\n"Ah! papa, I know what it means," she answered, in a half-sorrowful\r\ntone. "Christian, with the load on his back, is a person who has been\r\nconvinced of sin by God\'s Holy Spirit, and feels his sins a heavy\r\nburden--too heavy for him to bear; and then he tries to get rid of them\r\nby leaving off his wicked ways, and by doing good deeds; but he soon\r\nfinds he can\'t get rid of his load that way, for it only grows heavier\r\nand heavier, until at last he gives up trying to save himself, and just\r\ngoes to the cross of Jesus Christ; and the moment he looks to Jesus and\r\ntrusts in Him, his load of sin is all gone."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore was surprised; as indeed he had often been at Elsie\'s\r\nknowledge of spiritual things.\r\n\r\n"Who told you all that?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I read it in the Bible, papa; and besides, I know, because I have felt\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHe did not speak again for some moments; and then he said very gravely,\r\n"I am afraid you read too many of those dull books. I don\'t want you to\r\nread things that fill you with sad and gloomy thoughts, and make you\r\nunhappy. I want my little girl to be merry and happy as the day is\r\nlong."\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t forbid me to read them, papa," she pleaded with a look of\r\napprehension, "for indeed they don\'t make me unhappy, and I love them\r\nso dearly."\r\n\r\n"You need not be alarmed. I shall not do so unless I see that they do\r\naffect your spirits," he answered in a reassuring tone, and she thanked\r\nhim with her own bright, sweet smile.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment, then asked suddenly, "Papa, may I say some\r\nverses to you?"\r\n\r\n"Some time," he said, "but not now, for there is the tea-bell;" and\r\ntaking her hand, he led her down to the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThey went to the drawing-room after tea, but did not stay long. There\r\nwere no visitors, and it was very dull and quiet there, no one seeming\r\ninclined for conversation. Old Mr. Dinsmore sat nodding in his chair,\r\nLouise was drumming on the piano, and the rest were reading or sitting\r\nlistlessly, saying nothing, and Elsie and her papa soon slipped away to\r\ntheir old seat by his dressing-room fire.\r\n\r\n"Sing something for me, my pet, some of those little hymns I often hear\r\nyou singing to yourself," he said, as he took her on his knee; and\r\nElsie gladly obeyed.\r\n\r\nSome of the pieces she sang alone, but in others which were familiar to\r\nhim, her father joined his deep bass notes to her sweet treble, at\r\nwhich she was greatly delighted. Then they read several chapters of the\r\nBible together, and thus the evening passed so quickly and pleasantly\r\nthat she was very much surprised when her papa, taking out his watch,\r\ntold her it was her bed-time.\r\n\r\n"O papa! it has been such a nice, _nice_ evening!" she said, as she\r\nbade him good-night; "so like the dear old times I used to have with\r\nMiss Rose, only--"\r\n\r\nShe paused and colored deeply.\r\n\r\n"Only what, darling?" he asked, drawing her caressingly to him.\r\n\r\n"Only, papa, if you would pray with me, like she did," she whispered,\r\nwinding her arms about his neck, and hiding her face on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"That I cannot do, my pet, I have never learned how; and so I fear you\r\nwill have to do all the praying for yourself and me too," he said, with\r\na vain effort to speak lightly, for both heart and conscience were\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe only reply was a tightening of the clasp of the little arms about\r\nhis neck, and a half-suppressed sob; then two trembling lips touched\r\nhis, a warm tear fell on his cheek, and she turned away and ran quickly\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\nOh! how earnest and importunate were Elsie\'s pleadings at a throne of\r\ngrace that night, that her "dear, _dear_ papa might soon be taught to\r\nlove Jesus, and how to pray to Him." Tears fell fast while she prayed,\r\nbut she rose from her knees feeling a joyful assurance that her\r\npetitions had been heard, and would be granted in God\'s own good time.\r\n\r\nShe had hardly laid her head upon her pillow, when her father came in,\r\nand saying, "I have come to sit beside my little girl till she falls\r\nasleep," placed himself in a chair close by her side, taking her hand\r\nin his and holding it, as she loved so to have him do.\r\n\r\n"I am _so_ glad you have come, papa," she said, her whole face lighting\r\nup with pleased surprise.\r\n\r\n"Are you?" he answered with a smile. "I\'m afraid I am spoiling you; but\r\nI can\'t help it to-night. I think you forget your wish to repeat some\r\nverses to me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, papa!" she said, "but may I say them now?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded assent, and she went on. "They are some Miss Rose sent me in\r\none of her letters. She cut them out of a newspaper, she said, and sent\r\nthem to me because she liked them so much; and I too think they are\r\nvery sweet. The piece is headed:\r\n\r\n             "\'THE PILGRIM\'S WANTS.\'\r\n\r\n    "\'I want a sweet sense of Thy pardoning love,\r\n      That my manifold sins are forgiven;\r\n    That Christ, as my Advocate, pleadeth above,\r\n      That my name is recorded in heaven.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want every moment to feel\r\n      That thy Spirit resides in my heart--\r\n    That his power is present to cleanse and to heal,\r\n      And newness of life to impart.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want--oh! I want to attain\r\n       Some likeness, my Saviour, to thee!\r\n    That longed for resemblance once more to regain,\r\n      Thy comeliness put upon me.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want to be marked for thine own--\r\n      Thy seal on my forehead to wear;\r\n    To receive that new name on the mystic white stone\r\n      Which none but thyself can declare.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want so in thee to abide\r\n      As to bring forth some fruit to thy praise;\r\n    The branch which thou prunest, though feeble and dried,\r\n      May languish, but never decays.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want thine own hand to unbind\r\n      Each tie to terrestrial things,\r\n    Too tenderly cherished, too closely entwined,\r\n      Where my heart so tenaciously clings.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want, by my aspect serene,\r\n      My actions and words, to declare\r\n    That my treasure is placed in a country unseen,\r\n      That my heart\'s best affections are there.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want as a trav\'ller to haste\r\n      Straight onward, nor pause on my way;\r\n    Nor forethought in anxious contrivance to waste\r\n      On the tent only pitched for a day.\r\n\r\n    "\'I want--and this sums up my prayer--\r\n      To glorify thee till I die;\r\n    Then calmly to yield up my soul to thy care,\r\n      And breathe out in faith my last sigh.\'"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: These beautiful words are not mine, nor do I know either the\r\nname of the author or where they were originally published.]\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment after she had repeated the last verse, then\r\nlaying his hand softly on her head, and looking searchingly into her\r\neyes, he asked, "And does my little one really wish all that those\r\nwords express?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, for myself and for you too," she answered. "O papa! I do\r\nwant to be all that Jesus would have me! just like Him; so like Him\r\nthat everybody who knows me will see the likeness and know that I\r\nbelong to Him."\r\n\r\n"Nay, you belong to me," he said, leaning over her and patting her\r\ncheek. "Hush! not a syllable from your lips. I will have no gainsaying\r\nof my words," he added, with a mixture of authority and playfulness, as\r\nshe seemed about to reply. "Now shut your eyes and go to sleep; I will\r\nhave no more talking to-night."\r\n\r\nShe obeyed at once; the white lids gently closed over the sweet eyes,\r\nthe long, dark lashes rested quietly on the fair, round cheek, and soon\r\nher soft regular breathing told that she had passed into the land of\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nHer father sat, still holding the little hand, and still gazing\r\ntenderly upon the sweet young face, till, something in its expression\r\nreminding him of words she had just repeated,\r\n\r\n    "I want to be marked for thine own--\r\n     Thy seal on my forehead to wear,"\r\n\r\nhe laid it gently down, rose, and bent over her with a troubled look.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my darling, _that_ prayer is granted already!" he murmured; "for,\r\nah me! you seem almost too good and pure for earth. But oh, God forbid\r\nthat you should be taken from me to that place where I can see that\r\nyour heart is even now. How desolate should I be!" and he turned away\r\nwith a shiver and a heavy sigh, and hastily quitted the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "An angel face! its sunny wealth of hair,\r\n    In radiant ripples bathed the graceful throat\r\n    And dimpled shoulders."\r\n                                 --MRS. OSGOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cold gray light of a winter morning was stealing in through the\r\nhalf-closed blinds as Elsie awoke, and started up in bed, with the\r\nthought that this was the day on which several of her young guests were\r\nexpected, and that her papa had promised her a walk with him before\r\nbreakfast, if she were ready in time.\r\n\r\nAunt Chloe had already risen, and a bright fire was blazing and\r\ncrackling on the hearth, which she was carefully sweeping up.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, mammy," said the little girl. "Are you ready to dress me\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"What, you \'wake, darlin\'?" cried the fond old creature, turning\r\nquickly round at the sound of her nursling\'s voice. "Better lie still,\r\nhoney, till de room gets warm."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wait a little while, mammy," Elsie said, lying down again, "but I\r\nmust get up soon; for I wouldn\'t miss my walk with papa for a great\r\ndeal. Please throw the shutters wide open, and let the daylight in. I\'m\r\nso glad it has come."\r\n\r\n"Why, my bressed lamb, you didn\'t lie awake lookin\' for de mornin\', did\r\nyou? You ain\'t sick, nor sufferin\' any way?" exclaimed Chloe, in a tone\r\nof mingled concern and inquiry, as she hastily set down her broom, and\r\ncame toward the bed, with a look of loving anxiety on her dark face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, mammy! I slept nicely, and feel as well as can be," replied\r\nthe little girl; "but I am glad to see this new day, because I hope it\r\nis going to be a very happy one. Carry Howard, and a good many of my\r\nlittle friends are coming, you know, and I think we will have a very\r\npleasant time together."\r\n\r\n"Your ole mammy hopes you will, darlin\'," replied Chloe, heartily; "an\'\r\nI\'se glad \'nough to see you lookin\' so bright an\' well; but jes you lie\r\nstill till it gets warm here. I\'ll open de shutters, an\' fotch some\r\nmore wood for de fire, an\' clar up de room, an\' by dat time I reckon\r\nyou can get up."\r\n\r\nElsie waited patiently till Chloe pronounced the room warm enough, then\r\nsprang up with an eager haste, asking to be dressed as quickly as\r\npossible, that she might go to her papa.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you go for to worry yourself, darlin\'; dere\'s plenty ob time,"\r\nsaid Chloe, beginning her work with all speed, however; "de mistress\r\nhad ordered de breakfast at nine, dese holiday times, to let de ladies\r\nan\' gen\'lemen take a mornin\' nap if dey likes it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, mammy! and that reminds me that papa said I must eat a\r\ncracker or something before I take my walk, because he thinks it isn\'t\r\ngood for people to exercise much on an entirely empty stomach," said\r\nElsie. "Will you get me one when you have done my curls?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, honey, dere\'s a paper full in de drawer yonder," replied Chloe,\r\n"an\' I reckon you better eat two or three, or you\'ll be mighty hungry\r\n\'fore you gits your breakfast."\r\n\r\nIt still wanted a few minutes of eight o\'clock when Elsie\'s gentle rap\r\nwas heard at her papa\'s dressing-room door. He opened it, and stooping\r\nto give her a good-morning kiss, said, with a pleased smile, "How\r\nbright and well my darling looks! Had you a good night\'s rest?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, papa! I never waked once till it began to be light," she\r\nreplied; "and now I\'m all ready for our walk."\r\n\r\n"In good season, too," he said. "Well, we will start presently; but\r\ntake off your hat and come and sit on my knee a little while first;\r\nbreakfast will be late this morning, and we need not hurry. Did you get\r\nsomething to eat?" he asked, as he seated himself by the fire and drew\r\nher to his side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I ate a cracker, and I think I will not get very hungry\r\nbefore nine o\'clock; and I\'m very glad we have so much time for our\r\nwalk," she replied, as she took her place on his knee. "Shall we not\r\nstart soon?"\r\n\r\n"Presently," he said, stroking her hair; "but it will not hurt you to\r\nget well warmed first, for it is a sharp morning."\r\n\r\n"You are very careful of me, dear papa," she said, laying her head on\r\nhis breast, "and oh! it is so nice to have a papa to love me and take\r\ncare of me."\r\n\r\n"And it is so nice to have a dear little daughter to love and to take\r\ncare of," he answered, pressing her closer to him.\r\n\r\nThe house was still very quiet, no one seeming to be astir but the\r\nservants, as Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie went down the stairs and passed out\r\nthrough the hall.\r\n\r\n"O papa! it is going to be such a nice day, and I feel so happy!" Elsie\r\ngayly exclaimed, as they started down the avenue.\r\n\r\n"Do you, daughter?" he said, regarding her with an expression of\r\nintense yearning affection; "I wish I could make you always as gay and\r\nhappy as you are at this moment. But alas! it cannot be, my darling,"\r\nhe added with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"I know that, papa," she said with sudden gravity, "\'for man that is\r\nborn of woman is of few days, and full of trouble,\' the Bible says; but\r\nI don\'t feel frightened at that, because it tells me, besides, that\r\nJesus loves me, _oh, so dearly!_ and will never leave nor forsake me;\r\nand that He has all power in heaven and in earth, and will _never_ let\r\nanything happen to me but what shall do me good. O papa, it is such a\r\n_happy_ thing to have the dear Lord Jesus for your friend!"\r\n\r\n"It is strange how everything seems to lead your thoughts to Him," he\r\nsaid, giving her a wondering look.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, it is because I love Him so," she answered, simply; and the\r\nfather sighed as the thought arose, "Better than she loves me, even as\r\nshe told me herself. Ah! I would I could be _all_--_everything_ to her,\r\nas she is fast becoming to me. I cannot feel satisfied, and yet I\r\nbelieve few daughters love their fathers as well as she loves me;" and\r\nfondly pressing the little hand he held, he looked down upon her with\r\nbeaming eyes.\r\n\r\nShe raised hers to his face with an expression of confiding affection;\r\nand, as though she had read his thoughts: "Yes, papa," she said, "I\r\nlove _you_ dearly, dearly, too; better than all the world besides."\r\n\r\nBreakfast--always a plentiful and inviting meal at Roselands--was\r\nalready upon the table when they returned, and they brought to it\r\nappetites sufficiently keen to make it very enjoyable.\r\n\r\nElsie spent the first hour after breakfast at the piano, practising,\r\nand the second in her papa\'s dressing-room, studying and reciting to\r\nhim; then they took a long ride on horseback, and when they returned\r\nshe found that quite a number of the expected guests had already\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nAmong them was Caroline Howard, a favorite friend of Elsie\'s; a pretty,\r\nsweet-tempered little girl, about a year older than herself.\r\n\r\nCaroline had been away paying a long visit to some friends in the\r\nNorth, and so the two little girls had not met for nearly a year, and\r\nof course they had a great deal to say to each other.\r\n\r\nThey chatted a few moments in the drawing-room, and then Elsie carried\r\nher friend off with her to her own room, that they might go on with\r\ntheir talk while she was getting dressed for dinner. Caroline had much\r\nto tell of her Northern relatives, and of all she had seen and heard,\r\nand Elsie of her new-found parent, and her happiness in being so loved\r\nand cared for; and so the little tongues ran very fast, neither of them\r\nfeeling Chloe\'s presence any restraint. But she soon completed her\r\ntask, and went out, leaving the two sitting on the sofa together,\r\nlaughing and talking merrily while awaiting the summons to dinner,\r\nwhich they were to take that day along with their elders.\r\n\r\n"How pretty your hair is, Elsie," said Caroline, winding the glossy\r\nringlets around her finger. "I wish you\'d give me one of these curls. I\r\nwant to get a bracelet made for mamma, and she thinks so much of you,\r\nand your hair is such a lovely color, that I am sure she would be\r\ndelighted with one made of it."\r\n\r\n"A Christmas gift is it to be?" asked Elsie; "but how will you get it\r\ndone in time? for you know day after to-morrow is Christmas."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; but if I could get into the city this afternoon, I think\r\nI might get them to promise it by to-morrow night."\r\n\r\n"Well, you shall have the curl, at any rate, if you will just take the\r\nscissors and help yourself, and poor mammy will have the fewer to curl\r\nthe next time," Elsie answered, laughingly. "But mind," she added, as\r\nCaroline prepared to avail herself of the permission, "that you take it\r\nwhere it will not be missed."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will; I don\'t want to spoil your beauty, though you are so\r\nmuch prettier than I," was Caroline\'s laughing rejoinder. "There," she\r\ncried, holding up the severed ringlet, "isn\'t it a beauty? but don\'t\r\nlook scared, it will never be missed among so many; I don\'t even miss\r\nit myself, although I know it is gone."\r\n\r\n"Well," Elsie said, shaking back her curls, "suppose we go down to the\r\ndrawing-room now, and I will ask papa to take us to the city this\r\nafternoon; or, if he is too busy to go himself, to let Pomp or Ajax\r\ndrive us in."\r\n\r\n"I think it would be better fun to go alone, Elsie--don\'t you?" asked\r\nCaroline, with some hesitation; adding quickly: "Don\'t be vexed, but I\r\nmust confess I am more than half afraid of your father."\r\n\r\n"Oh! you wouldn\'t be, Carry, if you knew him," Elsie answered, in her\r\neager way; "I was a little myself, at first, but now I love him so\r\ndearly, I never want to go anywhere without him."\r\n\r\nThey found Mr. Dinsmore in the drawing-room, where most of the guests\r\nand the older members of the family were assembled. He was conversing\r\nwith a strange gentleman, and his little girl stood quietly at his\r\nside, patiently waiting until he should be ready to give her his\r\nattention. She had to wait some moments, for the gentlemen were\r\ndiscussing some political question, and were too much engaged to notice\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut at length her father put his arm around her, and with a kind smile\r\nasked, "What is it, daughter?"\r\n\r\n"Carry and I want to go to the city, this afternoon; won\'t you take us,\r\npapa?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I could, my dear, but I have an engagement, which makes it\r\nquite impossible."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m so sorry! but then, papa, we may have one of the carriages,\r\nand Pomp or Ajax to drive us, may we not?"\r\n\r\n"No, daughter; I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am afraid you are\r\ntoo young to be trusted on such an expedition with only a servant. You\r\nmust wait until to-morrow, when I can take you myself."\r\n\r\n"But, papa, we want to go to-day. Oh! please do say yes; we want to go\r\nso very much, and I\'m sure we could do very nicely by ourselves."\r\n\r\nHer arm was around his neck, and both tone and look were very coaxing.\r\n\r\n"My little daughter forgets that when papa says no, she is never to ask\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nElsie blushed and hung her head. His manner was quite too grave and\r\ndecided for her to venture another word.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter? what does Elsie want?" asked Adelaide, who was\r\nstanding near, and had overheard enough to have some idea of the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore explained, and Adelaide at once offered to take charge of\r\nthe little girls, saying that she intended shopping a little in the\r\ncity herself that very afternoon.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said her brother, looking very much pleased; "that\r\nobviates the difficulty entirely. Elsie, you may go, if Mrs. Howard\r\ngives Caroline permission."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear papa, thank you so very much," she answered\r\ngratefully, and then ran away to tell Carry of her success, and secure\r\nMrs. Howard\'s permission, which was easily obtained.\r\n\r\nElsie had intended buying some little present for each of the\r\nhouse-servants, and had taken a great deal of pleasure in making out a\r\nlist of such articles as she thought would be suitable; but, on\r\nexamining her purse, she found to her dismay that she had already spent\r\nso much on the miniature, and various gifts intended for other members\r\nof the family, that there was very little left; and it was with a very\r\nsober, almost sorrowful face, that she came down to take her place in\r\nthe carriage; it brightened instantly, though, as she caught sight of\r\nher father waiting to see her off.\r\n\r\n"All ready, my darling?" he said, holding out his hand; "I think you\r\nwill have a pleasant ride."\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes, if you were only going too, papa," she answered regretfully.\r\n\r\n"Quite impossible, my pet; but here is something to help you in your\r\nshopping; use it wisely;" and he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, papa! how good and kind you are to me!" she exclaimed,\r\nher whole face lighting up with pleasure; "now I can buy some things I\r\nwanted to get for mammy and the rest. But how could you know I wanted\r\nmore money?"\r\n\r\nHe only smiled, lifted her up in his arms, and kissed her fondly; then,\r\nplacing her in the carriage, said to the coachman, "Drive carefully,\r\nAjax; you are carrying my greatest treasure."\r\n\r\n"Nebber fear, marster; dese ole horses nebber tink ob running away,"\r\nreplied the negro, with a bow and a grin, as he touched his horses with\r\nthe whip, and drove off.\r\n\r\nIt was growing quite dark when the carriage again drove up the avenue;\r\nand Mr. Horace Dinsmore, who was beginning to feel a little anxious,\r\ncame out to receive them, and ask what had detained them so long.\r\n\r\n"Long!" said Adelaide, in a tone of surprise, "you gentlemen really\r\nhave no idea what an undertaking it is to shop. Why, I thought we got\r\nthrough in a wonderfully short time."\r\n\r\n"O papa, I have bought such quantities of nice things," cried Elsie,\r\nspringing into his arms.\r\n\r\n"Such as tobacco pipes, red flannel, et cetera," remarked Adelaide,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Miss Adelaide!" exclaimed Carry, somewhat indignantly, "you\r\nforget the----"\r\n\r\nBut Elsie\'s little hand was suddenly placed over her mouth, and Carry\r\nlaughed pleasantly, saying, "Ah! I forgot, I mustn\'t tell."\r\n\r\n"Papa, papa," cried Elsie, catching hold of his hand, "do come with me\r\nto my room, and let me show you my purchases."\r\n\r\n"I will, darling," he answered, pinching her cheek, "Here, Bill"--to a\r\nservant--"carry these bundles to Miss Elsie\'s room."\r\n\r\nThen, picking her up, he tossed her over his shoulder, and carried her\r\nup-stairs as easily as though she had been a baby, she clinging to him\r\nand laughing merrily.\r\n\r\n"Why, papa, how strong you are," she said, as he set her down. "I\r\nbelieve you can carry me as easily as I can my doll."\r\n\r\n"To be sure; you are my doll," said he, "and a very light burden for a\r\nman of my size and strength. But here come the bundles! what a number!\r\nno wonder you were late in getting home."\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, papa see! I want to show you!" and catching up one of them,\r\nshe hastily tore it open, displaying a very gay handkerchief. "This is\r\na turban for Aunt Phillis; and this is a pound of tobacco for old Uncle\r\nJack, and a nice pipe, too. Look, mammy! won\'t he be pleased? And\r\nhere\'s some flannel for poor old Aunt Dinah, who has the rheumatism;\r\nand that--oh! no, no, mammy! don\'t you open that! It\'s a nice shawl for\r\nher, papa," she whispered in his ear.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he said, smiling; "and which is my present? You had better point\r\nit out, lest I should stumble upon it and learn the secret too soon."\r\n\r\n"There is none here for you, sir," she replied, looking up into his\r\nface with an arch smile. "I would give you the bundle you carried\r\nup-stairs, just now, but I\'m afraid you would say that was not mine to\r\ngive, because it belongs to you already."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it does, and I feel richer in that possession than all the gold\r\nof California could make me," he said, pressing her to his heart.\r\n\r\nShe looked surpassingly lovely at that moment, her cheeks burning, and\r\nher eyes sparkling with excitement; the dark, fur-trimmed pelisse, and\r\nthe velvet hat and plumes, setting off to advantage the whiteness of\r\nher pure complexion and the glossy ringlets falling in rich masses on\r\nher shoulders.\r\n\r\n"My own papa! I\'m so glad I do belong to you," she said, throwing her\r\narms around his neck, and laying her cheek to his for an instant. Then\r\nspringing away, she added: "But I must show you the rest of the things;\r\nthere are a good many more."\r\n\r\nAnd she went on opening bundle after bundle, displaying their contents,\r\nand telling him for whom she intended them, until at last they had all\r\nbeen examined, and then she said, a little wearily, "Now, mammy, please\r\nput them all away until to-morrow. But first take off my things and get\r\nme ready to go downstairs."\r\n\r\n"No, daughter," Mr. Dinsmore said in a gentle but firm tone; "you are\r\nnot ready to have them put away until the price of each has been set\r\ndown in your book."\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa," she pleaded, "won\'t to-morrow do? I\'m tired now, and isn\'t\r\nit almost tea-time?"\r\n\r\n"No; never put off till to-morrow what may as well be done to-day.\r\nThere is nearly an hour yet before tea, and I do not think it need\r\nfatigue you much."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face clouded, and the slightest approach to a pout might have\r\nbeen perceived.\r\n\r\n"I hope my little girl is not going to be naughty," he said, very\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nHer face brightened in an instant. "No, papa," she answered cheerfully,\r\n"I will be good, and do whatever you bid me."\r\n\r\n"That is my own darling," said he, "and I will help you, and it will\r\nnot take long."\r\n\r\nHe opened her writing-desk as he spoke, and took out her account-book.\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa," she cried in a startled tone, springing forward and taking\r\nhold of his hand, "please, please don\'t look! you know you said I need\r\nnot show you until after Christmas."\r\n\r\n"No, I will not," he replied, smiling at her eagerness; "you shall put\r\ndown the items in the book, while I write the labels, and Aunt Chloe\r\npins them on. Will that do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! that\'s a nice plan, papa," she said gayly, as she threw off her\r\nhat and pelisse, and seating herself before the desk, took out her pen\r\nand ink.\r\n\r\nChloe put the hat and pelisse carefully away, brought a comb and brush,\r\nand smoothed her nursling\'s hair, and then began her share of the\r\nbusiness on hand.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour\'s work finished it all, and Elsie wiped her pen, and laid\r\nit away, saying joyously, "Oh! I\'m so glad it is all done."\r\n\r\n"Papa knew best, after all, did he not?" asked her father, drawing her\r\nto him, and patting her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she said softly; "you always know best, and I am very\r\nsorry I was naughty."\r\n\r\nHe answered with a kiss, and, taking her hand, led her down to the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nAfter tea the young people adjourned to the nursery, where they amused\r\nthemselves with a variety of innocent games. Quite early in the\r\nevening, and greatly to Elsie\'s delight, her father joined them; and,\r\nthough some of the young strangers were at first rather shy of him,\r\nthey soon found that he could enter heartily into their sports, and\r\nbefore the time came to separate for the night, he had made himself\r\nvery popular with nearly all.\r\n\r\nTime flew fast, and Elsie was very much surprised when the clock struck\r\neight. Half-past was her bedtime; and, as she now and then glanced up\r\nat the dial-plate, she thought the hands had never moved so fast. As it\r\nstruck the half hour she drew near her father\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Papa," she asked, "is the clock right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, it is," he replied, comparing it with his watch.\r\n\r\n"And must I go to bed now?" she asked, half hoping for permission to\r\nstay up a little longer.\r\n\r\n"Yes, daughter; keep to rules."\r\n\r\nElsie looked disappointed, and several little voices urged, "Oh, do let\r\nher stay up another hour, or at least till nine o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"No; I cannot often allow a departure from rules," he said kindly, but\r\nfirmly; "and to-morrow night Elsie will find it harder to go to bed in\r\nseason than to-night. Bid your little friends good-night, my dear, and\r\ngo at once."\r\n\r\nElsie obeyed, readily and cheerfully. "You, too, papa," she said,\r\ncoming to him last.\r\n\r\n"No, darling," he answered, laying his hand caressingly on her head,\r\nand smiling approvingly on her; "I will come for my good-night kiss\r\nbefore you are asleep."\r\n\r\nElsie looked very glad, and went away feeling herself the happiest\r\nlittle girl in the land, in spite of the annoyance of being forced to\r\nleave the merry group in the nursery. She was just ready for bed when\r\nher papa came in, and, taking her in his arms, folded her to his heart,\r\nsaying, "My own darling! my good, obedient little daughter!"\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, I love you so much!" she replied, twining her arms around\r\nhis neck, "I love you all the better for never letting me have my own\r\nway, but always making me obey and keep to rules."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt it, daughter," he said, "for I have often noticed that\r\nspoiled, petted children, usually have very little love for their\r\nparents, or indeed for any one but themselves. But I must put you in\r\nyour bed, or you will be in danger of taking cold."\r\n\r\nHe laid her down, tucked the clothes snugly about her, and pressing one\r\nmore kiss on the round, rosy cheek, left her to her slumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n                  "You play the spaniel,\r\n    And think with wagging of your tongue to win me."\r\n                           --SHAKESPEARE\'s _Henry Eighth_.\r\n\r\n   "These delights, if thou canst give,\r\n    Mirth, with thee I mean to live."\r\n                                 --MILTON\'s _L\'Allegro_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young party at Roselands had now grown so large--several additions\r\nhaving been made to it on Monday afternoon and evening--that a separate\r\ntable was ordered to be spread for them in the nursery, where they took\r\ntheir meals together; Mrs. Brown, the housekeeper, taking the head of\r\nthe table, for the double purpose of keeping them in order, and seeing\r\nthat their wants were well supplied.\r\n\r\nElsie came in to breakfast, from a brisk walk with her papa, looking\r\nfresh and rosy, and bright as the morning; quite different from some of\r\nthe little guests, who had been up far beyond their usual hours the\r\nnight before, and, having just left their beds, had come down pale and\r\nlanguid in looks, and in some instances showing peevish and fretful\r\ntempers, very trying to the patience of their attendants.\r\n\r\n"O Elsie!" exclaimed Carry Howard, as the little girl took her place at\r\nthe table, "we were all so sorry that you had to leave us so soon last\r\nnight; we had lots of fun after you left. I think your papa might have\r\nlet you stay up a little longer; but he has promised that tonight--as\r\nwe are to have the Christmas-tree, and ever so much will be going\r\non--you shall stay up till half-past nine, if you like. Aren\'t you\r\nglad? I\'m sure I am."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa is very kind, and I know I feel much better for going to bed\r\nearly last night," said Elsie, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," remarked Mrs. Brown, "late hours and rich food are very\r\nbad for little folks, and I notice that Miss Elsie has grown a deal\r\nstronger and healthier-looking since her papa came home; he takes such\r\ngood care of her."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he does," said Elsie heartily, thanking Mrs. Brown with one of\r\nher sweetest smiles.\r\n\r\n"What are we going to do to-day, Elsie?" asked Caroline.\r\n\r\n"Whatever you all prefer," said Elsie. "If you like I will practice\r\nthat duet with you the first hour after breakfast, or do anything else\r\nyou wish; but the second hour I must spend with papa, and after that I\r\nhave nothing to do but entertain my company all day."\r\n\r\n"Do you do lessons in holidays?" asked Mary Leslie, a merry, fun-loving\r\nchild, about Elsie\'s own age, who considered lessons an intolerable\r\nbore, and had some vague idea that they must have been invented for the\r\nsole purpose of tormenting children. Her blue eyes opened wide with\r\nastonishment when Elsie quietly replied that her papa had kindly\r\narranged to give her an hour every morning, because he knew it would be\r\nso much pleasanter for her than spending the whole day in play.\r\n\r\nElsie did keenly enjoy that quiet hour spent in studying and reciting\r\nto her father, sitting on a low stool at his feet, or perhaps oftener\r\non his knee, with his arm around her waist.\r\n\r\nShe had an eager and growing thirst for knowledge, and was an apt\r\nscholar, whom any one with the least love for the profession might have\r\ndelighted in teaching; and Mr. Dinsmore, a thorough scholar himself,\r\nand loving knowledge for its own sake--loving also his little pupil\r\nwith all a father\'s fond, yearning affection--delighted in his task.\r\n\r\nWhen Elsie left her father she found that the Carringtons had just\r\narrived. She and Lucy had not seen each other since the week the latter\r\nhad spent at Roselands early in the summer, and both felt pleased to\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrington gave Elsie a warm embrace, remarking that she had\r\ngrown, and was looking extremely well; better than she had ever seen\r\nher. But no one was more delighted to meet Elsie than Herbert, and she\r\nwas very glad to learn that his health was gradually improving. He was\r\nnot, however, at all strong, even yet, and his mother thought it best\r\nfor him to lie down and rest a little after his ride. She promised to\r\nsit by him, and the two little girls went in search of the rest of the\r\nyoung folks.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the older boys had gone out walking or riding, but the\r\nyounger ones, and all the little girls, were gathered in a little back\r\nparlor, where, by Adelaide\'s care and forethought, a variety of\r\nstory-books, toys, and games, had been provided for their amusement.\r\nElsie\'s entrance was hailed with delight, for she was a general\r\nfavorite.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Elsie, can\'t you tell us what to play?" cried Mary Leslie; "I\'m so\r\ntired," and she yawned wearily.\r\n\r\n"Here are some dissected maps, Mary," replied Elsie, opening a drawer;\r\n"would you not like them?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, thank you; they are too much like lessons."\r\n\r\n"Here are blocks; will you build houses?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I am too big for that; they are very nice for little children."\r\n\r\n"Will you play jack-stones? here are some smooth pebbles."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you and Carry, and Lucy, will play with me."\r\n\r\n"Agreed!" said the others, "let\'s have a game."\r\n\r\nSo, Elsie having first set the little ones to building block-houses,\r\nsupplied Harry Carrington--an older brother of Lucy\'s--with a book, and\r\ntwo younger boys with dissected maps to arrange, the four girls sat\r\ndown in a circle on the carpet and began their game.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments all went on smoothly; but soon angry and complaining\r\nwords were heard coming from the corner where the house-building was\r\ngoing on. Elsie left her game to try to make peace.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, Flora, dear?" she asked soothingly of a little\r\ncurly-headed girl, who was sobbing, and wiping her eyes with the corner\r\nof her apron.\r\n\r\n"Enna took my blocks," sobbed the child.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Enna, won\'t you give them back?" said Elsie, coaxingly; "you know\r\nFlora is a visitor, and we must be very polite to her."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t," returned Enna, flatly; "she\'s got enough now."\r\n\r\n"No, I haven\'t; I can\'t build a house with those," Flora said, with\r\nanother sob.\r\n\r\nElsie stood a moment looking much perplexed; then, with a brightening\r\nface, exclaimed in her cheerful, pleasant way, "Well, never mind,\r\nFlora, dear, I will get you my doll. Will not that do quite as\r\nwell?"--"Oh! yes, I\'d rather have the doll, Elsie," the little weeper\r\nanswered eagerly, smiling through her tears.\r\n\r\nElsie ran out of the room and was back again almost in a moment, with\r\nthe doll in her arms.\r\n\r\n"There, dear little Flora," she said, laying it gently on the child\'s\r\nlap, "please be careful of it for I have had it a long while, and prize\r\nit very much, because my guardian gave it to me when I was a very\r\nlittle girl, and he is dead now."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t break it, Elsie, indeed I won\'t," replied Flora, confidently;\r\nand Elsie sat down to her game again.\r\n\r\nA few moments afterward Mr. Horace Dinsmore passed through the room.\r\n\r\n"Elsie," he said, as he caught sight of his little daughter, "go up to\r\nmy dressing-room."\r\n\r\nThere was evidently displeasure and reproof in his tone, and, entirely\r\nunconscious of wrongdoing, Elsie looked up in surprise, asking, "Why,\r\npapa?"\r\n\r\n"Because _I bid_ you," he replied; and she silently obeyed, wondering\r\ngreatly what she had done to displease her father.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore passed out of one door while Elsie left by the other.\r\n\r\nThe three little girls looked inquiringly into each other\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter? what has Elsie done?" asked Carry in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; nothing I guess," replied Lucy, indignantly. "I do\r\nbelieve he\'s just the crossest man alive! When I was here last summer\r\nhe was all the time scolding and punishing poor Elsie for just nothing\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"I think he must be very strict," said Carry; "but Elsie seems to love\r\nhim very much."\r\n\r\n"Strict! I guess he is!" exclaimed Mary; "why, only think, girls, he\r\nmakes her do her lessons in the holidays!"\r\n\r\n"I suspect she did not know her lesson, and has to learn it over," said\r\nCarry, shaking her head wisely; and that was the conclusion they all\r\ncame to.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Elsie sat down alone in her banishment, and tried to\r\nthink what she could have done to deserve it.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before she could form any idea of its cause; but at\r\nlength it suddenly came to her recollection that once, several months\r\nbefore this, her father had found her sitting on the carpet, and had\r\nbade her get up immediately and sit on a chair or stool, saying, "Never\r\nlet me see you sitting on the floor, Elsie, when there are plenty of\r\nseats at hand. I consider it a very unladylike and slovenly trick."\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands, and sat thus for some moments,\r\nfeeling very sorry for her forgetfulness and disobedience; very\r\npenitent on account of it; and then, kneeling down, she asked\r\nforgiveness of God.\r\n\r\nA full hour she had been there alone, and the time had seemed very\r\nlong, when at last the door opened and her father came in.\r\n\r\nElsie rose and came forward to meet him with the air of one who had\r\noffended and knew she was in disgrace; but putting one of her little\r\nhands in his, she looked up pleadingly into his face, asking, in a\r\nslightly tremulous tone, "Dear papa, are you angry with me?"\r\n\r\n"I am always displeased when you disobey me, Elsie," he replied, very\r\ngravely, laying his other hand on her head.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry I was naughty, papa," she said, humbly, and casting\r\ndown her eyes, "but I had quite forgotten that you had told me not to\r\nsit on the floor, and I could not think for a good while what it was\r\nthat I had done wrong."\r\n\r\n"Is _that_ an excuse for disobedience, Elsie?" he asked in a tone of\r\ngrave displeasure.\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I did not mean it so, and I am very, very sorry; dear papa,\r\nplease forgive me, and I will try never to forget again."\r\n\r\n"I think you disobeyed in another matter," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I know it was very naughty to ask why, but I think I will\r\nremember not to do it again. Dear papa, won\'t you forgive me?"\r\n\r\nHe sat down and took her on his knee.\r\n\r\n"Yes, daughter, I will," he said, in his usual kind, affectionate tone;\r\n"I am always ready to forgive my little girl when I see that she is\r\nsorry for a fault."\r\n\r\nShe held up her face for a kiss, which he gave.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could always be good, papa," she said, "but I am naughty so\r\noften."\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "I think you have been a very good girl for quite a long\r\ntime. If you were as naughty as Arthur and Enna, I don\'t know what I\r\nshould do with you; whip you every day, I suspect, until I made a\r\nbetter girl of you. Now you may go down to your mates; but _remember_,\r\nyou are not to play jack-stones again."\r\n\r\nIt was now lunch-time, and Elsie found the children in the nursery\r\nengaged in eating.\r\n\r\nFlora turned to her as she entered.\r\n\r\n"Please, Elsie, don\'t be cross," she said coaxingly: "I am real sorry\r\nyour doll\'s broken, but it wasn\'t my fault Enna would try to snatch it,\r\nand that made it fall and break its head."\r\n\r\nPoor Elsie! this was quite a trial, and she could scarcely keep back\r\nthe tears as, following Flora\'s glance, she saw her valued doll lying\r\non the window-seat with its head broken entirely off. She said not a\r\nword, but, hastily crossing the room, took it up and gazed mournfully\r\nat it.\r\n\r\nKind Mrs. Brown, who had just finished helping her young charge all\r\nround, followed her to the window, "Never mind, dear," she said in her\r\npleasant, cheery tone, patting Elsie\'s cheek and smoothing her hair\r\n"I\'ve got some excellent glue, and I think I can stick it on again and\r\nmake it almost as good as ever. So come, sit down and eat your lunch,\r\nand don\'t fret any more."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am, you are very kind," Elsie said, trying to smile, as\r\nthe kind-hearted old lady led her to the table and filled her plate\r\nwith fruit and cakes.\r\n\r\n"These cakes are very simple, not at all rich, my dear, but quite what\r\nyour papa would approve of," she said, seeing the little girl look\r\ndoubtfully at them.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t your papa let you eat anything good, Elsie?" asked Mary Leslie\r\nacross the table. "He must be cross."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, he is not, Mary, and he lets me eat everything that he\r\nthinks is good for me," Elsie answered with some warmth.\r\n\r\nShe was seated between Caroline Howard and Lucy Carrington.\r\n\r\n"What _did_ your papa send you away for, Elsie?" whispered the latter.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t ask me, Lucy," replied the little girl, blushing deeply.\r\n"Papa always has a good reason for what he does, and he is just the\r\ndearest, kindest, and best father that ever anybody had."\r\n\r\nElsie spoke in an eager, excited, almost angry manner, quite unusual\r\nwith her, while the hot tears came into her eyes, for she knew very\r\nwell what was Lucy\'s opinion of her father, and more than half\r\nsuspected that she had been making some unkind remark about him to the\r\nothers, and she was eager to remove any unfavorable impression they\r\nmight have received.\r\n\r\n"I am sure he must love you very dearly, Elsie," remarked Caroline,\r\nsoothingly; "no one could help seeing that just by the way he looks at\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nElsie answered her with a pleased and grateful look; and then changed\r\nthe subject by proposing that they should all take a walk as soon as\r\nthey had finished eating, as the day was fine, and there would be\r\nplenty of time before dinner.\r\n\r\nThe motion was carried without a dissenting voice, and in a few moments\r\nthey all set out, a very merry party, full of fun and frolic. They had\r\na very pleasant time, and returned barely in season to be dressed for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThey dined by themselves in the nursery, but were afterward taken down\r\nto the drawing-room. Here Elsie found herself immediately seized upon\r\nby a young lady, dressed in very gay and fashionable style, whom she\r\ndid not remember ever to have seen before, but who insisted on seating\r\nthe little girl on the sofa by her side, and keeping her there a long\r\nwhile, loading her with caresses and flattery.\r\n\r\n"My dear child," she said, "what lovely hair you have! so fine, and\r\nsoft, and glossy; such a beautiful color, too, and curls so\r\n_splendidly! Natural_ ringlets, I\'m sure, are they not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," Elsie answered, simply, wishing from the bottom of her\r\nheart that the lady would release her, and talk to some one else.\r\n\r\nBut the lady had no such intention.\r\n\r\n"You are a very sweet little girl, I am sure, and I shall love you\r\ndearly," she said, kissing her several times. "Ah! I would give\r\n_anything_ if I had such a clear fair complexion and such rosy cheeks.\r\nThat makes you blush. Well, I like to see it; blushes are very\r\nbecoming. Oh! you needn\'t pretend you don\'t know you\'re handsome;\r\nyou\'re a perfect little beauty. Do tell me, where did you get such\r\nsplendid eyes! But I needn\'t ask, for I have only to look at your\r\nfather to see where they came from. Mr. Dinsmore"--to Elsie\'s papa, who\r\njust then came toward them--"you ought to be very proud of this child;\r\nshe is the very image of yourself, and a perfect little beauty, too."\r\n\r\n"Miss Stevens is pleased to flatter me," he said, bowing low; "but\r\nflattery is not good for either grown-up children or younger ones, and\r\nI must beg leave to decline the compliment, as I cannot see that Elsie\r\nbears the slightest resemblance to me or any of my family. She is very\r\nlike her mother, though," he added, with a half sigh and a tender,\r\nloving glance at his little girl, "and that is just what I would have\r\nher. But I am forgetting my errand, Miss Stevens; I came to ask if you\r\nwill ride this afternoon, as we are getting up a small party."\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you, I should like it dearly, it is such a lovely day. But\r\nhow soon do you start?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as the ladies can be ready. The horses will be at the door in\r\na very few moments."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then I must go and prepare," she said, rising and sailing out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore took the seat she had vacated, and, passing his arm round\r\nhis little girl, said to her in an undertone, "My little daughter must\r\nnot be so foolish as to believe that people mean all they say to her;\r\nfor some persons talk in a very thoughtless way, and, without perhaps\r\nintending to be exactly untruthful, say a great deal that they really\r\ndo not mean. And I should be sorry, indeed, to see my little girl so\r\nspoiled by all this silly flattery as to grow up conceited and vain."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with her own sweet innocent smile, free from the\r\nslightest touch of vanity.\r\n\r\n"No, papa," she said, "I do not mind, when people say such things,\r\nbecause I know the Bible says, \'Favor is deceitful, and beauty is\r\nvain;\' and in another place, \'He that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth\r\na net for his feet.\' So I will try to keep away from that lady; shall I\r\nnot, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Whenever you can do so without rudeness, daughter;" and he moved away,\r\nthinking to himself, "How strangely the teachings of that book seem to\r\npreserve my child from every evil influence."\r\n\r\nA sigh escaped him. There was lurking within his breast a vague\r\nconsciousness that her father needed such a safeguard, but had it not.\r\n\r\nLucy, who was standing at the window, turned quickly round.\r\n\r\n"Come, girls," she said, "let us run out and see them off; they\'re\r\nbringing up the horses. And see, there\'s Miss Adelaide in her\r\nriding-dress and cap; how pretty she looks! And there\'s that Miss\r\nStevens coming out now; hateful thing! I can\'t bear her! Come, Elsie\r\nand Carry!"\r\n\r\nAnd she ran out, Caroline and Elsie following. Elsie, however, went no\r\nfurther than the hall, where she stood still at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Come, Elsie," called the other two from the portico, "come out here."\r\n\r\n"No," replied the little girl, "I cannot come without something round\r\nme. Papa says it is too cold for me to be out in the wind to-day with\r\nmy neck and arms bare."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! nonsense!" said Lucy, "\'tain\'t a bit cold; _do_ come now."\r\n\r\n"No, Lucy, I must obey my father," Elsie answered in a very pleasant\r\nbut no less decided tone.\r\n\r\nSome one caught her round the waist and lifted her up.\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa," she exclaimed, "I did not know you were there! I wish I was\r\ngoing too; I don\'t like to have _you_ go without me."\r\n\r\n"I wish you were, my pet; I always love to have you with me; but you\r\nknow it wouldn\'t do; you have your little guests to entertain. Good-by,\r\ndarling. Don\'t go out in the cold."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her, as he always did now, when leaving her even for an hour\r\nor two, and set her down.\r\n\r\nThe little girls watched until the last of the party had disappeared\r\ndown the avenue, and then ran gayly up-stairs to Elsie\'s room, where\r\nthey busied themselves until tea-time in various little preparations\r\nfor the evening, such as dressing dolls, and tying up bundles of\r\nconfectionery, etc., to be hung upon the Christmas-tree.\r\n\r\nThe children had all noticed that the doors of a parlor opening into\r\nthe drawing-room had been closed since morning to all but a favored\r\nfew, who passed in and out, with an air of mystery and importance, and\r\ngenerally laden with some odd-looking bundle when going in, which they\r\ninvariably left behind on coming out again, and many a whispered\r\nconsultation had been held as to what was probably going on in there.\r\nElsie and Carry seemed to be in the secret, but only smiled and shook\r\ntheir heads wisely when questioned.\r\n\r\nBut at length tea being over, and all, both old and young, assembled as\r\nif by common consent in the drawing-room, it began to be whispered\r\nabout that their curiosity was now on the point of being gratified.\r\n\r\nAll were immediately on the _qui vive_, and every face brightened with\r\nmirth and expectation; and when, a moment after, the doors were thrown\r\nopen, there was a universal burst of applause.\r\n\r\nA large Christmas-tree had been set up at the further end of the room,\r\nand, with its myriad of lighted tapers, and its load of toys and\r\nbonbons, interspersed with many a richer and more costly gift, made\r\nquite a display.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful! beautiful!" cried the children, clapping their hands and\r\ndancing about with delight, while their elders, perhaps equally\r\npleased, expressed their admiration after a more staid and sober\r\nfashion. When they thought their handiwork had been sufficiently\r\nadmired, Mrs. Dinsmore and Adelaide approached the tree and began the\r\npleasant task of distributing the gifts.\r\n\r\nEverything was labelled, and each, as his or her name was called out,\r\nstepped forward to receive the present.\r\n\r\nNo one had been forgotten; each had something, and almost every one had\r\nseveral pretty presents. Mary Leslie and little Flora Arnott were made\r\nperfectly happy with wax dolls that could open and shut their eyes;\r\nCaroline Howard received a gold chain from her mamma, and a pretty pin\r\nfrom Elsie; Lucy, a set of coral ornaments, besides several smaller\r\npresents; and others were equally fortunate. All was mirth and\r\nhilarity; only one clouded face to be seen, and that belonged to Enna,\r\nwho was pouting in a corner because Mary Leslie\'s doll was a little\r\nlarger than hers.\r\n\r\nElsie had already received a pretty bracelet from her Aunt Adelaide, a\r\nneedle-case from Lora, and several little gifts from her young guests,\r\nand was just beginning to wonder what had become of her papa\'s promised\r\npresent, when she heard her name again, and Adelaide, turning to her\r\nwith a pleased look, slipped a most beautiful diamond ring on her\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n"From your papa," she said. "Go and thank him: it is well worth it."\r\n\r\nElsie sought him out where he stood alone in a corner, an amused\r\nspectator of the merry scene.\r\n\r\n"See, papa," she said, holding up her hand. "I think it very beautiful;\r\nthank you, dear papa, thank you very much."\r\n\r\n"Does it please you, my darling?" he asked, stooping to press a kiss on\r\nthe little upturned face, so bright and happy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I think it is lovely! the very prettiest ring I ever saw."\r\n\r\n"Yet I think there is something else you would have liked better; is\r\nthere not?" he asked, looking searchingly into her face.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, I like it _very_ much; I would rather have it than anything\r\nelse on the tree."\r\n\r\n"Still you have not answered my question," he said, with a smile, as he\r\nsat down and drew her to his side, adding in a playful tone, "Come, I\r\nam not going to put up with any evasion; tell me truly if you would\r\nhave preferred something else, and if so, what it is."\r\n\r\nElsie blushed and looked down; then raising her eyes, and seeing with\r\nwhat a tender, loving glance he was regarding her, she took courage to\r\nsay, "Yes papa, there is _one_ thing I would have liked better, and\r\nthat is your miniature."\r\n\r\nTo her surprise he looked highly pleased at her reply, and giving her\r\nanother kiss, said, "Well, darling, some day you shall have it."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Horace Dinsmore," called Adelaide, taking some small, glittering\r\nobject from the tree.\r\n\r\n"Another present for me?" he asked, as Walter came running with it.\r\n\r\nHe had already received several, from his father and sisters, but none\r\nhad seemed to give him half the pleasure that this did when he saw that\r\nit was labelled, "From his little daughter."\r\n\r\nIt was only a gold pencil. The miniature--with which the artist had\r\nsucceeded so well that nothing could have been prettier except the\r\noriginal herself--she had reserved to be given in another way.\r\n\r\n"Do you like it, papa?" she asked, her face glowing with delight to see\r\nhow pleased he was.\r\n\r\n"Yes, darling, very much; and I shall always think of my little girl\r\nwhen I use it."\r\n\r\n"Keep it in your pocket, and use it every day, won\'t you, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my pet, I will; but I thought you said you had no present for me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no, papa; I said there was none for you amongst those bundles.\r\nI had bought this, but had given it to Aunt Adelaide to take care of,\r\nfor fear you might happen to see it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that was it, eh?" and he laughed and stroked her hair.\r\n\r\n"Here, Elsie, here is your bundle of candy," said Walter, running up to\r\nthem again. "Everybody has one, and that is yours, Adelaide says."\r\n\r\nHe put it in her hand, and ran away again. Elsie looked up in her\r\nfather\'s face inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"No, darling," he said, taking the paper from her hand and examining\r\nits contents, "not to-night; to-morrow, after breakfast, you may eat\r\nthe cream-candy and the rock, but none of the others; they are colored,\r\nand very unwholesome."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t _you_ eat some, papa?" she asked with winning sweetness.\r\n\r\n"No, dearest," he said; "for though I, too, am fond of sweet things, I\r\nwill not eat them while I refuse them to you."\r\n\r\n"Do, papa," she urged, "it would give me pleasure to see you enjoying\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No, darling, _I_ will wait until to-morrow, too."\r\n\r\n"Then please keep it for me until to-morrow, papa, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, putting it in his pocket; and then, as the gifts had\r\nall been distributed, and the little folks were in high glee, a variety\r\nof sports were commenced by them, in which some of their elders also\r\ntook a part; and thus the hours sped away so rapidly that Elsie was\r\nvery much surprised when her father called her to go to bed.\r\n\r\n"Is it half-past nine already, papa?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"It is ten, my dear child, and high time you were in bed," he said,\r\nsmiling at her look of astonishment. "I hope you have enjoyed yourself."\r\n\r\n"Oh! _so_ much, papa. Good-night, and thank you for letting me stay up\r\nso long."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Ask me not why I should love her;--\r\n      Look upon those soulful eyes!\r\n    Look while mirth or feeling move her,\r\n      And see there how sweetly rise\r\n    Thoughts gay and gentle from a breast\r\n    Which is of innocence the nest--\r\n    Which, though each joy were from it shred,\r\n    By truth would still be tenanted!"\r\n                                 --HOFFMAN\'S _Poems_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was yet dark when Elsie awoke, but, hearing the clock strike five,\r\nshe knew it was morning. She lay still a little while, and then,\r\nslipping softly out of bed, put her feet into her slippers, threw her\r\nwarm dressing-gown around her, and feeling for a little package she had\r\nleft on her toilet-table, she secured it and stole noiselessly from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAll was darkness and silence in the house, but she had no thought of\r\nfear; and, gliding gently down the hall to her papa\'s door, she turned\r\nthe handle very cautiously, when, to her great delight, she found it\r\nhad been left unfastened, and yielded readily to her touch.\r\n\r\nShe entered as quietly as a little mouse, listened a moment until\r\nsatisfied from his breathing that her father was still sound asleep,\r\nthen, stepping softly across the room, she laid her package down where\r\nhe could not fail to see it as soon as daylight came and his eyes were\r\nopened. This accomplished, she stole back again as noiselessly as she\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\n"Who dat?" demanded Chloe, starting up in bed as Elsie reentered her\r\nown apartment.\r\n\r\n"It is only I; did I frighten you, mammy?" answered the little girl\r\nwith a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n"Ki? chile, dat _you?_ what you doin\' runnin\' \'bout de house all in de\r\ndark, cold night?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t night, mammy; I heard it strike five some time ago."\r\n\r\n"Well, den, dis chile gwine get right up an\' make de fire. But jes you\r\ncreep back into de bed, darlin\', \'fore you cotch your death ob cold."\r\n\r\n"I will, mammy," Elsie said, doing as she was desired; "but please\r\ndress me as soon as the room is warm enough, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, darlin\', kase ob course I knows you want to be up early o\'\r\nChristmas mornin\'. Ki! Miss Elsie, dat\'s a beautiful shawl you gave\r\nyour ole mammy. I sha\'n\'t feel de cold at all dis winter."\r\n\r\n"I hope not, mammy; and were Aunt Phillis, and Uncle Jack, and all the\r\nrest pleased with their presents?"\r\n\r\n"I reckon dey was, darlin\', mos\' ready to go off de handle, \'tirely."\r\n\r\nChloe had soon built up her fire and coaxed it into a bright blaze, and\r\nin a few moments more she pronounced the room sufficiently warm for her\r\nnursling to get up and be dressed.\r\n\r\nElsie was impatient to go to her father; but, even after she had been\r\ncarefully dressed and all her morning duties attended to, it was still\r\nso early that Chloe advised her to wait a little longer, assuring her\r\nthat it was only a very short time since John had gone in to make his\r\nmaster\'s fire and supply him with hot water for shaving.\r\n\r\nSo the little girl sat down and tried to drown her impatience in the\r\npages of a new book--one of her Christmas presents. But Chloe presently\r\nstole softly behind her chair, and, holding up high above her head some\r\nglittering object attached to a pretty gold chain, let it gradually\r\ndescend until it rested upon the open book.\r\n\r\nElsie started and jumped up with an exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n"Wonder if you knows dat gen\'leman, darlin\'?" laughed Chloe.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is papa," cried the little girl, catching it in her hand, "my\r\nown dear, darling papa! oh! how good of him to give it to me!" and she\r\ndanced about the room in her delight. "It is just himself, so exactly\r\nlike him! _Isn\'t_ it a good likeness, mammy?" she asked, drawing near\r\nthe light to examine it more closely. "Dear, dear, _darling_ papa!" and\r\nshe kissed it again and again.\r\n\r\nThen gently drawing her mother\'s miniature from her bosom, she laid\r\nthem side by side.\r\n\r\n"My papa and mamma; are they not beautiful, mammy? both of them?" she\r\nasked, raising her swimming eyes to the dusky face leaning over her,\r\nand gazing with such mournful fondness at the sweet girlish\r\ncountenance, so life-like and beautiful, yet calling up thoughts of\r\nsorrow and bereavement.\r\n\r\n"My darling young missus!" murmured the old nurse, "my own precious\r\nchile dat dese arms hab carried so many years, dis ole heart like to\r\nbreak when-eber I tinks ob you, an\' \'members how your bright young face\r\ndone gone away foreber."\r\n\r\nThe big tears were rolling fast down the sable cheeks, and dropping\r\nlike rain on Elsie\'s curls, while the broad bosom heaved with sobs.\r\n"But your ole mammy\'s been good to your little chile dat you lef\'\r\nbehind, darlin\',\'deed she has," she went on.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mammy, indeed, indeed you have," Elsie said, twining her arms\r\nlovingly around her. "But don\'t let us cry any more, for we know that\r\ndear mamma is very happy in heaven, and does not wish us to grieve for\r\nher now. I shall not show you the picture any more if it makes you cry\r\nlike that," she added half playfully.\r\n\r\n"Not always, chile," Chloe said, wiping away her tears, "but jes dis\r\nhere mornin\'--Christmas mornin\', when she was always so bright and\r\nmerry. It seems only yesterday she went dancin\' about jes like you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mammy dear, but she is with the angels now--my sweet, pretty\r\nmamma!" Elsie whispered softly, with another tender, loving look at the\r\npicture ere she returned it to its accustomed resting-place in her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n"And now I must go to papa," she said more cheerfully, "for it is\r\nalmost breakfast time."\r\n\r\n"Is my darling satisfied _now?_" he asked, as she ran into his arms and\r\nwas folded in a close embrace.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, indeed I am; thank you a thousand times; it is all I\r\nwanted."\r\n\r\n"And you have given me the most acceptable present you could have\r\nfound. It is a most excellent likeness, and I am delighted with it."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad, papa, but it was Aunt Adelaide who thought of it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that was very kind of her. But how does my little girl feel this\r\nmorning, after all her dissipation?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! very well, thank you, papa."\r\n\r\n"You will not want to say any lesson to-day, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, if you please, papa, and it does not give you too much\r\ntrouble," she said. "It is the very pleasantest hour in the day,\r\nexcept--"\r\n\r\n"Well, except what? Ah, yes, I understand. Well, my pet, it shall be as\r\nyou wish; but come to me directly after breakfast, as I am going out\r\nearly."\r\n\r\nElsie had had her hour with her father, but, though he had left her and\r\ngone out, she still lingered in his dressing-room, looking over the\r\nnext day\'s lesson. At length, however, she closed the book and left the\r\nroom, intending to seek her young guests, who were in the lower part of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens\' door was open as she passed, and that lady called to her,\r\n"Elsie, dear, you sweet little creature, come here, and see what I have\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\nElsie obeyed, though rather reluctantly, and Miss Stevens bidding her\r\nsit down, went to a drawer, and took out a large paper of mixed candy,\r\nall of the best and most expensive kinds, which she put into the little\r\ngirl\'s hands with one of her sweetest smiles.\r\n\r\nIt was a strong temptation to a child who had a great fondness for such\r\nthings, but Elsie had prayed from her heart that morning for strength\r\nto resist temptation, and it was given her.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am, you are very kind," she said gratefully, "but I\r\ncannot take it, because papa does not approve of my eating such things.\r\nHe gave me a little this morning, but said I must not have any more for\r\na long time."\r\n\r\n"Now, that is quite too bad," exclaimed Miss Stevens, "but at least\r\ntake one or two, child; that much couldn\'t possibly hurt you, and your\r\npapa need never know."\r\n\r\nElsie gave her a look of grieved surprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh! could you think I would do that?" she said. "But _God_ would know,\r\nMiss Stevens; and I should know it myself, and how could I ever look my\r\npapa in the face again after deceiving him so?"\r\n\r\n"Really, my dear, you are making a very serious matter of a mere\r\ntrifle," laughed the lady; "why, I have deceived my father more than\r\nfifty times, and never thought it any harm. But here is something I am\r\nsure you can take, and indeed you must, for I bought both it and the\r\ncandy expressly for you."\r\n\r\nShe replaced the candy in the drawer as she spoke, and took from\r\nanother a splendidly-bound book which she laid in Elsie\'s lap, saying,\r\nwith a triumphant air, "There, my dear, what do you think of that? is\r\nit not handsome?"\r\n\r\nElsie\'s eyes sparkled; books were her greatest treasures; but feeling\r\nan instinctive repugnance to taking a gift from one whom she could\r\nneither respect nor love, she made an effort to decline it, though at\r\nthe same time thanking the lady warmly for her kind intentions.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Stevens would hear of no refusal, and fairly forced it upon\r\nher acceptance, declaring that, as she had bought it expressly for her,\r\nshe should feel extremely hurt if she did not take it.\r\n\r\n"Then I will, Miss Stevens," said the little girl, "and I am sure you\r\nare very kind. I love books and pictures, too, and these are lovely\r\nengravings," she added turning over the leaves with undisguised\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the stories are right pretty, too," remarked Miss Stevens.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, they look as if they were, and I should like dearly to\r\nread them."\r\n\r\n"Well, dear, just sit down and read; there\'s nothing to hinder. I\'m\r\nsure your little friends can do without you for an hour or two. Or, if\r\nyou prefer it, take the book and enjoy it with them; it is your own,\r\nyou know, to use as you like."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am; but, though I can look at the pictures, I must not\r\nread the stories until I have asked papa, because he does not allow me\r\nto read anything now without first showing it to him."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! how very strict he is!" exclaimed Miss Stevens.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," she thought to herself, "if he would expect to domineer\r\nover his wife in that style?"\r\n\r\nElsie was slowly turning over the leaves of the book, enjoying the\r\npictures very much, studying them intently, but resolutely refraining\r\nfrom even glancing over the printed pages. But at length she closed it,\r\nand, looking out of the window, said, with a slight sigh, "Oh! I wish\r\npapa would come; but I\'m afraid he won\'t for a long while, and I do so\r\nwant to read these stories."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you let me read one to you," suggested Miss Stevens; "that\r\nwould not be _your_ reading it, you know."\r\n\r\nElsie looked shocked at the proposal. "Oh! no, ma\'am, thank you, I know\r\nyou mean to be kind; but I could not do it; it would be so very wrong;\r\nquite the same, I am sure, as if I read it with my own eyes," she\r\nanswered hurriedly; and then, fearing to be tempted further, she\r\nexcused herself and went in search of her young companions.\r\n\r\nShe found them in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it too provoking, Elsie, that those people didn\'t send home my\r\nbracelet last night?" exclaimed Caroline Howard. "I have just been\r\ntelling Lucy about it. I think that it was such a shame for them to\r\ndisappoint me, for I wanted to have it on the tree."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you were disappointed, Carry, but perhaps it will come\r\nto-day," Elsie answered in a sympathizing tone. And then she showed the\r\nnew book, which she still held in her hand.\r\n\r\nThey spent some time in examining it, talking about and admiring the\r\npictures, and then went out for a walk.\r\n\r\n"Has papa come in yet, mammy?" was Elsie\'s first question on returning.\r\n\r\n"Yes, darlin\', I tink he\'s in the drawin\'-room dis berry minute," Chloe\r\nanswered, as she took off the little girl\'s hat, and carefully smoothed\r\nher hair.\r\n\r\n"There, there! mammy, won\'t that do now? I\'m in a little bit of a\r\nhurry," Elsie said with a merry little laugh, as she slipped playfully\r\nfrom under her nurse\'s hand, and ran down-stairs.\r\n\r\nBut she was doomed to disappointment for the present, for her papa was\r\nseated on the sofa, beside Miss Stevens, talking to her; and so she\r\nmust wait a little longer. At last, however, he rose, went to the other\r\nside of the room, and stood a moment looking out of the window.\r\n\r\nThen Elsie hastened to take her book from a table, where she had laid\r\nit, and going up to him, said, "Papa!"\r\n\r\nHe turned round instantly, asking in a pleasant tone, "Well, daughter,\r\nwhat is it?"\r\n\r\nShe put the book into his hand, saying eagerly, "It is a Christmas gift\r\nfrom Miss Stevens, papa; will you let me read it?"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer immediately, but turned over the leaves, glancing\r\nrapidly over page after page, but not too rapidly to be able to form a\r\npretty correct idea of the contents.\r\n\r\n"No, daughter," he said, handing it back to her, "you must content\r\nyourself with looking at the pictures; they are by far the best part;\r\nthe stories are very unsuitable for a little girl of your age, and\r\nwould, indeed, be unprofitable reading for any one."\r\n\r\nShe looked a little disappointed.\r\n\r\n"I am glad I can _trust_ my little daughter, and feel certain that she\r\nwill not disobey me," he said, smiling kindly on her, and patting her\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nShe answered him with a bright, happy look, full of confiding\r\naffection, laid the book away without a murmur, and left the room--her\r\nfather\'s eyes following her with a fond, loving glance.\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens, who had watched them both closely during this little\r\nscene, bit her lips with vexation at the result of her manoeuvre.\r\n\r\nShe had come to Roselands with the fixed determination to lay siege to\r\nMr. Horace Dinsmore\'s heart, and flattering and petting his little\r\ndaughter was one of her modes of attack; but his decided disapproval of\r\nher present, she perceived, did not augur well for the success of her\r\nschemes. She was by no means in despair, however, for she had great\r\nconfidence in the power of her own personal attractions, being really\r\ntolerably pretty, and considering herself a great beauty, as well as\r\nvery highly accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs Elsie ran out into the hall, she found herself suddenly caught in\r\nMr. Travilla\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"\'A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\' little Elsie," he said,\r\nkissing her on both cheeks. "Now I have caught you figuratively and\r\nliterally, my little lady, so what are you going to give me, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir, I think you\'ve helped yourself to the only thing I have\r\nto give at present," she answered with a merry silvery laugh.\r\n\r\n"Nay, _give_ me one, little lady," said he, "one such hug and kiss as I\r\ndare say your father gets half-a-dozen times in a day."\r\n\r\nShe gave it very heartily.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I wish you were ten years older," he said as he set her down.\r\n\r\n"If I had been, you wouldn\'t have got the kiss," she replied, smiling\r\narchly.\r\n\r\n"Now, it\'s my turn," he said, taking something from his pocket.\r\n\r\n"I expected you\'d catch _me_, and so thought it best to come prepared."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, as he spoke, and placed a beautiful little gold\r\nthimble on her finger. "There, that\'s to encourage you in industry."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir; oh! it\'s a little beauty! I must run and show it to\r\npapa. But I must not forget my politeness," she added, hastily throwing\r\nopen the drawing-room door. "Come in, Mr. Travilla."\r\n\r\nShe waited quietly until the usual greetings were exchanged, then went\r\nup to her father and showed her new gift.\r\n\r\nHe quite entered into her pleasure, and remarked, with a glance at Miss\r\nStevens, "that her friends were very kind."\r\n\r\nThe lady\'s hopes rose. He was then pleased with her attention to his\r\nchild, even though he did not altogether approve her choice of a gift.\r\n\r\nThere was a large party to dinner that day, and the children came down\r\nto the dessert. Miss Stevens, who had contrived to be seated next to\r\nMr. Dinsmore, made an effort, on the entrance of the juveniles, to have\r\nElsie placed on her other side; but Mr. Travilla was too quick for her,\r\nand had his young favorite on his knee before she could gain her\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe lady was disappointed, and Elsie herself only half satisfied; but\r\nthe two gentlemen, who thoroughly understood Miss Stevens and saw\r\nthrough all her manoeuvres, exchanged glances of amusement and\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Mr. Travilla invited Elsie, Carry, Lucy, and Mary, to take\r\na ride in his carriage, which invitation was joyfully accepted by\r\nall--Mr. Dinsmore giving a ready consent to Elsie\'s request to be\r\npermitted to go.\r\n\r\nThey had a very merry time, for Mr. Travilla quite laid himself out for\r\ntheir entertainment, and no one knew better than he how to amuse ladies\r\nof their age.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark when they returned, and Elsie went at once to her\r\nroom to be dressed for the evening. But she found it unoccupied--Aunt\r\nChloe, as it afterward appeared, having gone down to the quarter to\r\ncarry some of the little girl\'s gifts to one or two who were too old\r\nand feeble to come up to the house to receive them.\r\n\r\nElsie rang the bell, waited a little, and then, feeling impatient to be\r\ndressed, ran down to the kitchen to see what had become of her nurse.\r\n\r\nA very animated discussion was going on there, just at that moment,\r\nbetween the cook and two or three of her sable companions, and the\r\nfirst words that reached the child\'s ears, as she stood on the\r\nthreshold, were, "I tell you, you ole darkie, you dunno nuffin\' \'bout\r\nit! Massa Horace gwine marry _dat_ bit ob paint an\' finery! no such\r\nting! Massa\'s got more sense."\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken in a most scornful tone, and Elsie, into whose\r\nchildish mind the possibility of her father\'s marrying again had never\r\nentered, stood spellbound with astonishment.\r\n\r\nBut the conversation went on, the speakers quite unconscious of her\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nIt was Pompey\'s voice that replied.\r\n\r\n"Ef Marse Horace don\'t like her, what for they been gwine ridin\' ebery\r\nafternoon? will you tell me dat, darkies? an\' don\'t dis niggah see him\r\nsit beside her mornin\', noon, an\' night, laughin\' an\' talkin\' at de\r\ntable an\' in de parlor? an\' don\'t she keep a kissin\' little Miss Elsie,\r\nan\' callin\' her pretty critter, sweet critter, an\' de like?"\r\n\r\n"_She_ ma to our sweet little Miss Elsie! Bah! I tell you, Pomp, Marse\r\nHorace got more sense," returned the cook, indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Chloe don\'t b\'lieve no such stuff," put in another voice; "she\r\nsays Marse Horace _couldn\'t_ put such trash in her sweet young mistis\'s\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Chloe\'s a berry fine woman, no doubt," observed Pomp\r\ndisdainfully, "but I reckon Marse Horace ain\'t gwine to infide his\r\nmatermonical intentions to her; and I consider it quite consequential\r\non Marster\'s being young and handsome that he will take another wife."\r\n\r\nThe next speaker said something about his having lived a good while\r\nwithout, and though Miss Stevens _was_ setting her cap, maybe he\r\nwouldn\'t be caught. But Elsie only gathered the sense of it, hardly\r\nheard the words, and, bounding away like a frightened deer to her own\r\nroom, her little heart beating wildly with a confused sense of\r\nsuffering, she threw herself on the bed. She shed no tears, but there\r\nwas, oh! such a weight on her heart, such a terrible though vague sense\r\nof the instability of all earthly happiness.\r\n\r\nThere Chloe found her, and wondered much what ailed her darling, what\r\nmade her so silent, and yet so restless, and caused such a deep flush\r\non her cheek. She feared she was feverish, her little hand was so hot\r\nand dry; but Elsie insisted that she was quite well, and so Chloe tried\r\nto think it was only fatigue.\r\n\r\nShe would fain have persuaded the little girl to lie still upon her bed\r\nand rest, and let her tea be brought to her there; but Elsie answered\r\nthat she would much rather be dressed, and join her young companions in\r\nthe nursery. They, too, wondered what ailed her, she was so very quiet\r\nand ate almost nothing at all. They asked if she was sick. She only\r\nshook her head. "Was she tired, then?" "Yes, she believed she was," and\r\nshe leaned her head wearily on her hand.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, most of the party seemed dull; they had gone through such\r\na round of pleasure and excitement, for the last two or three days,\r\nthat now a reaction was beginning, and they wanted rest, especially the\r\nvery little ones, who all retired quite early, when Elsie and her mates\r\njoined their parents in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nElsie looked eagerly around for her father, the moment she entered the\r\nroom. He was beside Miss Stevens, who was at the piano, performing a\r\nvery difficult piece of music. He was leaning over her, turning the\r\nleaves, and apparently listening with a great deal of pleasure, for she\r\nwas really a fine musician.\r\n\r\nElsie felt sick at heart at the sight--although a few hours before it\r\nwould have given her no concern--and found it very difficult to listen\r\nto and answer the remarks Mrs. Carrington was making to her about her\r\nChristmas presents, and the nice ride they had had that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla was watching her; he had noticed, as soon as she came in,\r\nthe sad and troubled look which had come over her face, and, following\r\nthe glance of her eyes, he guessed at the cause.\r\n\r\nHe knew there was no danger of the trial that she feared, and would\r\nhave been glad to tell her so; but he felt that it was too delicate a\r\nsubject for him to venture on; it might seem too much like meddling in\r\nMr. Dinsmore\'s affairs. But he did the next best thing--got the four\r\nlittle girls into a corner, and tried to entertain them with stories\r\nand charades.\r\n\r\nElsie seemed interested for a time, but every now and then her eyes\r\nwould wander to the other side of the room, where her father still\r\nstood listening to Miss Stevens\' music.\r\n\r\nAt length Mr. Travilla was called away to give his opinion about some\r\ntableaux the young ladies were arranging; and Elsie, knowing it was her\r\nusual time for retiring, and not caring to avail herself of her\r\nfather\'s permission to stay up until nine o\'clock, stole quietly away\r\nto her room unobserved by any one, and feeling as if Miss Stevens had\r\nalready robbed her of her father.\r\n\r\nShe wiped away a few quiet tears, as she went, and was very silent and\r\nsad, while her mammy was preparing her for bed. She hardly knew how to\r\ndo without her good-night kiss, but feeling as she did, it had seemed\r\nquite impossible to ask for it while Miss Stevens was so near him.\r\n\r\nWhen she knelt down to pray, she became painfully conscious that a\r\nfeeling of positive dislike to that lady had been creeping into her\r\nheart, and she asked earnestly to be enabled to put it away. But she\r\nprayed, also, that she might be spared the trial that she feared, if\r\nGod\'s will were so; and she thought surely it was because she had found\r\nout that Miss Stevens was not good, not truthful, or sincere.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps dear papa will come to say good-night before I am asleep," she\r\nmurmured to herself as, calmed and soothed by thus casting her burden\r\non the Lord, she laid her head upon her pillow.\r\n\r\nHe, however, had become interested in the subject of the tableaux, and\r\ndid not miss his little girl until the sound of the clock striking ten\r\nreminded him of her, and he looked around expecting to see her still in\r\nthe room; but, not seeing her, he asked Lucy Carrington where she was.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Lucy, "she\'s been gone these two hours, I should think! I\r\nguess she must have gone to bed."\r\n\r\n"Strange that she did not come to bid me goodnight," he exclaimed in a\r\nlow tone, more as if thinking aloud than speaking to Lucy.\r\n\r\nHe hastily left the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla followed.\r\n\r\n"Dinsmore," said he.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore stopped, and Travilla, drawing him to one side, said in an\r\nundertone, "I think my little friend is in trouble to-night."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he exclaimed, with a startled look, "what can it be? I did not\r\nhear of any accident--she has not been hurt? is not sick? tell me,\r\nTravilla, quickly, if anything ails my child."\r\n\r\n"Nothing, nothing, Dinsmore, only you know servants will talk, and\r\nchildren have ears, and eyes, too, sometimes, and I saw her watching\r\nyou to-night with a very sad expression."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" exclaimed Mr. Dinsmore, growing very red and looking\r\nextremely vexed; "I wouldn\'t have had such thoughts put into the\r\nchild\'s head for any money. Are you sure of it, Travilla?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure she was watching you very closely tonight, and looking very\r\nmiserable."\r\n\r\n"Poor darling!" murmured the father. "Thank you, Travilla," shaking his\r\nfriend heartily by the hand. "Good-night; I shall not be down again if\r\nyou will be so good as to excuse me to the others."\r\n\r\nAnd he went up the stairs almost at a bound, and the next moment was\r\nstanding beside his sleeping child, looking anxiously down at the\r\nlittle flushed cheeks and tear-swollen eyes, for, disappointed that he\r\ndid not come to bid her good-night, she had cried herself to sleep.\r\n\r\n"Poor darling!" he murmured again, as he stooped over her and kissed\r\naway a tear that still trembled on her eyelash.\r\n\r\nHe longed to tell her that all her fears were groundless, that none\r\nother could ever fill her place in his heart, but he did not like to\r\nwake her, and so, pressing another light kiss on her cheek, he left her\r\nto dream on unconscious of his visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Elsie Dinsmore, by Martha Finley\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ELSIE DINSMORE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 6440.txt or 6440.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/4/4/6440/\r\n\r\nProduced by Vital Debroey, Charles Franks and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
