Tradesmen\r\ntrouble us a bit, so does the scraper.  The Curate calls and pays me a\r\ngreat compliment.\r\n\r\nMy dear wife Carrie and I have just been a week in our new house, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nLaurels,\xe2\x80\x9d Brickfield Terrace, Holloway\xe2\x80\x94a nice six-roomed residence, not\r\ncounting basement, with a front breakfast-parlour.  We have a little\r\nfront garden; and there is a flight of ten steps up to the front door,\r\nwhich, by-the-by, we keep locked with the chain up.  Cummings, Gowing,\r\nand our other intimate friends always come to the little side entrance,\r\nwhich saves the servant the trouble of going up to the front door,\r\nthereby taking her from her work.  We have a nice little back garden\r\nwhich runs down to the railway.  We were rather afraid of the noise of\r\nthe trains at first, but the landlord said we should not notice them\r\nafter a bit, and took \xc2\xa32 off the rent.  He was certainly right; and\r\nbeyond the cracking of the garden wall at the bottom, we have suffered no\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nAfter my work in the City, I like to be at home.  What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of a\r\nhome, if you are never in it?  \xe2\x80\x9cHome, Sweet Home,\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s my motto.  I am\r\nalways in of an evening.  Our old friend Gowing may drop in without\r\nceremony; so may Cummings, who lives opposite.  My dear wife Caroline and\r\nI are pleased to see them, if they like to drop in on us.  But Carrie and\r\nI can manage to pass our evenings together without friends.  There is\r\nalways something to be done: a tin-tack here, a Venetian blind to put\r\nstraight, a fan to nail up, or part of a carpet to nail down\xe2\x80\x94all of which\r\nI can do with my pipe in my mouth; while Carrie is not above putting a\r\nbutton on a shirt, mending a pillow-case, or practising the \xe2\x80\x9cSylvia\r\nGavotte\xe2\x80\x9d on our new cottage piano (on the three years\xe2\x80\x99 system),\r\nmanufactured by W. Bilkson (in small letters), from Collard and Collard\r\n(in very large letters).  It is also a great comfort to us to know that\r\nour boy Willie is getting on so well in the Bank at Oldham.  We should\r\nlike to see more of him.  Now for my diary:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAPRIL 3.\xe2\x80\x94Tradesmen called for custom, and I promised Farmerson, the\r\nironmonger, to give him a turn if I wanted any nails or tools.\r\nBy-the-by, that reminds me there is no key to our bedroom door, and the\r\nbells must be seen to.  The parlour bell is broken, and the front door\r\nrings up in the servant\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, which is ridiculous.  Dear friend\r\nGowing dropped in, but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay, saying there was an infernal smell\r\nof paint.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 4.  Tradesmen still calling; Carrie being out, I arranged to deal\r\nwith Horwin, who seemed a civil butcher with a nice clean shop.  Ordered\r\na shoulder of mutton for to-morrow, to give him a trial.  Carrie arranged\r\nwith Borset, the butterman, and ordered a pound of fresh butter, and a\r\npound and a half of salt ditto for kitchen, and a shilling\xe2\x80\x99s worth of\r\neggs.  In the evening, Cummings unexpectedly dropped in to show me a\r\nmeerschaum pipe he had won in a raffle in the City, and told me to handle\r\nit carefully, as it would spoil the colouring if the hand was moist.  He\r\nsaid he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay, as he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much for the smell of the paint,\r\nand fell over the scraper as he went out.  Must get the scraper removed,\r\nor else I shall get into a _scrape_.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t often make jokes.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 5.\xe2\x80\x94Two shoulders of mutton arrived, Carrie having arranged with\r\nanother butcher without consulting me.  Gowing called, and fell over\r\nscraper coming in.  _Must_ get that scraper removed.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 6.\xe2\x80\x94Eggs for breakfast simply shocking; sent them back to Borset\r\nwith my compliments, and he needn\xe2\x80\x99t call any more for orders.  Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind umbrella, and though it was pouring with rain, had to go without it.\r\nSarah said Mr. Gowing must have took it by mistake last night, as there\r\nwas a stick in the \xe2\x80\x98all that didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to nobody.  In the evening,\r\nhearing someone talking in a loud voice to the servant in the downstairs\r\nhall, I went out to see who it was, and was surprised to find it was\r\nBorset, the butterman, who was both drunk and offensive.  Borset, on\r\nseeing me, said he would be hanged if he would ever serve City clerks any\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94the game wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the candle.  I restrained my feelings, and\r\nquietly remarked that I thought it was _possible_ for a city clerk to be\r\na _gentleman_.  He replied he was very glad to hear it, and wanted to\r\nknow whether I had ever come across one, for _he_ hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.  He left the\r\nhouse, slamming the door after him, which nearly broke the fanlight; and\r\nI heard him fall over the scraper, which made me feel glad I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremoved it.  When he had gone, I thought of a splendid answer I ought to\r\nhave given him.  However, I will keep it for another occasion.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 7.\xe2\x80\x94Being Saturday, I looked forward to being home early, and\r\nputting a few things straight; but two of our principals at the office\r\nwere absent through illness, and I did not get home till seven.  Found\r\nBorset waiting.  He had been three times during the day to apologise for\r\nhis conduct last night.  He said he was unable to take his Bank Holiday\r\nlast Monday, and took it last night instead.  He begged me to accept his\r\napology, and a pound of fresh butter.  He seems, after all, a decent sort\r\nof fellow; so I gave him an order for some fresh eggs, with a request\r\nthat on this occasion they _should_ be fresh.  I am afraid we shall have\r\nto get some new stair-carpets after all; our old ones are not quite wide\r\nenough to meet the paint on either side.  Carrie suggests that we might\r\nourselves broaden the paint.  I will see if we can match the colour (dark\r\nchocolate) on Monday.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 8, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94After Church, the Curate came back with us.  I sent\r\nCarrie in to open front door, which we do not use except on special\r\noccasions.  She could not get it open, and after all my display, I had to\r\ntake the Curate (whose name, by-the-by, I did not catch,) round the side\r\nentrance.  He caught his foot in the scraper, and tore the bottom of his\r\ntrousers.  Most annoying, as Carrie could not well offer to repair them\r\non a Sunday.  After dinner, went to sleep.  Took a walk round the garden,\r\nand discovered a beautiful spot for sowing mustard-and-cress and\r\nradishes.  Went to Church again in the evening: walked back with the\r\nCurate.  Carrie noticed he had got on the same pair of trousers, only\r\nrepaired.  He wants me to take round the plate, which I think a great\r\ncompliment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTradesmen and the scraper still troublesome.  Gowing rather tiresome with\r\nhis complaints of the paint.  I make one of the best jokes of my life.\r\nDelights of Gardening.  Mr. Stillbrook, Gowing, Cummings, and I have a\r\nlittle misunderstanding.  Sarah makes me look a fool before Cummings.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 9.\xe2\x80\x94Commenced the morning badly.  The butcher, whom we decided _not_\r\nto arrange with, called and blackguarded me in the most uncalled-for\r\nmanner.  He began by abusing me, and saying he did not want my custom.  I\r\nsimply said: \xe2\x80\x9cThen what are you making all this fuss about it for?\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nhe shouted out at the top of his voice, so that all the neighbours could\r\nhear: \xe2\x80\x9cPah! go along.  Ugh!  I could buy up \xe2\x80\x98things\xe2\x80\x99 like you by the\r\ndozen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shut the door, and was giving Carrie to understand that this\r\ndisgraceful scene was entirely her fault, when there was a violent\r\nkicking at the door, enough to break the panels.  It was the blackguard\r\nbutcher again, who said he had cut his foot over the scraper, and would\r\nimmediately bring an action against me.  Called at Farmerson\xe2\x80\x99s, the\r\nironmonger, on my way to town, and gave him the job of moving the scraper\r\nand repairing the bells, thinking it scarcely worth while to trouble the\r\nlandlord with such a trifling matter.\r\n\r\nArrived home tired and worried.  Mr. Putley, a painter and decorator, who\r\nhad sent in a card, said he could not match the colour on the stairs, as\r\nit contained Indian carmine.  He said he spent half-a-day calling at\r\nwarehouses to see if he could get it.  He suggested he should entirely\r\nrepaint the stairs.  It would cost very little more; if he tried to match\r\nit, he could only make a bad job of it.  It would be more satisfactory to\r\nhim and to us to have the work done properly.  I consented, but felt I\r\nhad been talked over.  Planted some mustard-and-cress and radishes, and\r\nwent to bed at nine.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 10.\xe2\x80\x94Farmerson came round to attend to the scraper himself.  He\r\nseems a very civil fellow.  He says he does not usually conduct such\r\nsmall jobs personally, but for me he would do so.  I thanked him, and\r\nwent to town.  It is disgraceful how late some of the young clerks are at\r\narriving.  I told three of them that if Mr. Perkupp, the principal, heard\r\nof it, they might be discharged.\r\n\r\nPitt, a monkey of seventeen, who has only been with us six weeks, told me\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto keep my hair on!\xe2\x80\x9d  I informed him I had had the honour of being in\r\nthe firm twenty years, to which he insolently replied that I \xe2\x80\x9clooked it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI gave him an indignant look, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI demand from you some respect,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, go on demanding.\xe2\x80\x9d  I would not argue with\r\nhim any further.  You cannot argue with people like that.  In the evening\r\nGowing called, and repeated his complaint about the smell of paint.\r\nGowing is sometimes very tedious with his remarks, and not always\r\ncautious; and Carrie once very properly reminded him that she was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 11.\xe2\x80\x94Mustard-and-cress and radishes not come up yet.  To-day was a\r\nday of annoyances.  I missed the quarter-to-nine \xe2\x80\x99bus to the City,\r\nthrough having words with the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy, who for the second time had\r\nthe impertinence to bring his basket to the hall-door, and had left the\r\nmarks of his dirty boots on the fresh-cleaned door-steps.  He said he had\r\nknocked at the side door with his knuckles for a quarter of an hour.  I\r\nknew Sarah, our servant, could not hear this, as she was upstairs doing\r\nthe bedrooms, so asked the boy why he did not ring the bell?  He replied\r\nthat he did pull the bell, but the handle came off in his hand.\r\n\r\nI was half-an-hour late at the office, a thing that has never happened to\r\nme before.  There has recently been much irregularity in the attendance\r\nof the clerks, and Mr. Perkupp, our principal, unfortunately chose this\r\nvery morning to pounce down upon us early.  Someone had given the tip to\r\nthe others.  The result was that I was the only one late of the lot.\r\nBuckling, one of the senior clerks, was a brick, and I was saved by his\r\nintervention.  As I passed by Pitt\xe2\x80\x99s desk, I heard him remark to his\r\nneighbour: \xe2\x80\x9cHow disgracefully late some of the head clerks arrive!\xe2\x80\x9d  This\r\nwas, of course, meant for me.  I treated the observation with silence,\r\nsimply giving him a look, which unfortunately had the effect of making\r\nboth of the clerks laugh.  Thought afterwards it would have been more\r\ndignified if I had pretended not to have heard him at all.  Cummings\r\ncalled in the evening, and we played dominoes.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 12.\xe2\x80\x94Mustard-and-cress and radishes not come up yet.  Left Farmerson\r\nrepairing the scraper, but when I came home found three men working.  I\r\nasked the meaning of it, and Farmerson said that in making a fresh hole\r\nhe had penetrated the gas-pipe.  He said it was a most ridiculous place\r\nto put the gas-pipe, and the man who did it evidently knew nothing about\r\nhis business.  I felt his excuse was no consolation for the expense I\r\nshall be put to.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after tea, Gowing dropped in, and we had a smoke together\r\nin the breakfast-parlour.  Carrie joined us later, but did not stay long,\r\nsaying the smoke was too much for her.  It was also rather too much for\r\nme, for Gowing had given me what he called a green cigar, one that his\r\nfriend Shoemach had just brought over from America.  The cigar didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook green, but I fancy I must have done so; for when I had smoked a\r\nlittle more than half I was obliged to retire on the pretext of telling\r\nSarah to bring in the glasses.\r\n\r\nI took a walk round the garden three or four times, feeling the need of\r\nfresh air.  On returning Gowing noticed I was not smoking: offered me\r\nanother cigar, which I politely declined.  Gowing began his usual\r\nsniffing, so, anticipating him, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to complain of\r\nthe smell of paint again?\xe2\x80\x9d  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not this time; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what, I distinctly smell dry rot.\xe2\x80\x9d  I don\xe2\x80\x99t often make jokes, but I\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re talking a lot of _dry rot_ yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d  I could not help\r\nroaring at this, and Carrie said her sides quite ached with laughter.  I\r\nnever was so immensely tickled by anything I have ever said before.  I\r\nactually woke up twice during the night, and laughed till the bed shook.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 13.\xe2\x80\x94An extraordinary coincidence: Carrie had called in a woman to\r\nmake some chintz covers for our drawing-room chairs and sofa to prevent\r\nthe sun fading the green rep of the furniture.  I saw the woman, and\r\nrecognised her as a woman who used to work years ago for my old aunt at\r\nClapham.  It only shows how small the world is.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 14.\xe2\x80\x94Spent the whole of the afternoon in the garden, having this\r\nmorning picked up at a bookstall for fivepence a capital little book, in\r\ngood condition, on _Gardening_.  I procured and sowed some half-hardy\r\nannuals in what I fancy will be a warm, sunny border.  I thought of a\r\njoke, and called out Carrie.  Carrie came out rather testy, I thought.  I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI have just discovered we have got a lodging-house.\xe2\x80\x9d  She replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the _boarders_.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthat all you wanted me for?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cAny other time you would have\r\nlaughed at my little pleasantry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94_at any other\r\ntime_, but not when I am busy in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d  The stairs looked very\r\nnice.  Gowing called, and said the stairs looked _all right_, but it made\r\nthe banisters look _all wrong_, and suggested a coat of paint on them\r\nalso, which Carrie quite agreed with.  I walked round to Putley, and\r\nfortunately he was out, so I had a good excuse to let the banisters\r\nslide.  By-the-by, that is rather funny.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 15, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94At three o\xe2\x80\x99clock Cummings and Gowing called for a good\r\nlong walk over Hampstead and Finchley, and brought with them a friend\r\nnamed Stillbrook.  We walked and chatted together, except Stillbrook, who\r\nwas always a few yards behind us staring at the ground and cutting at the\r\ngrass with his stick.\r\n\r\nAs it was getting on for five, we four held a consultation, and Gowing\r\nsuggested that we should make for \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cow and Hedge\xe2\x80\x9d and get some tea.\r\nStillbrook said: \xe2\x80\x9cA brandy-and-soda was good enough for him.\xe2\x80\x9d  I reminded\r\nthem that all public-houses were closed till six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.  Stillbrook\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x94_bona-fide_ travellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe arrived; and as I was trying to pass, the man in charge of the gate\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere from?\xe2\x80\x9d  I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway.\xe2\x80\x9d  He immediately put up his\r\narm, and declined to let me pass.  I turned back for a moment, when I saw\r\nStillbrook, closely followed by Cummings and Gowing, make for the\r\nentrance.  I watched them, and thought I would have a good laugh at their\r\nexpense, I heard the porter say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere from?\xe2\x80\x9d  When, to my surprise, in\r\nfact disgust, Stillbrook replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBlackheath,\xe2\x80\x9d and the three were\r\nimmediately admitted.\r\n\r\nGowing called to me across the gate, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t be a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI waited for them the best part of an hour.  When they appeared they were\r\nall in most excellent spirits, and the only one who made an effort to\r\napologise was Mr. Stillbrook, who said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very rough on you\r\nto be kept waiting, but we had another spin for S. and B.\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d  I walked\r\nhome in silence; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to them.  I felt very dull all the\r\nevening, but deemed it advisable _not_ to say anything to Carrie about\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 16.\xe2\x80\x94After business, set to work in the garden.  When it got dark I\r\nwrote to Cummings and Gowing (who neither called, for a wonder; perhaps\r\nthey were ashamed of themselves) about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s adventure at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cow\r\nand Hedge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Afterwards made up my mind not to write _yet_.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 17.\xe2\x80\x94Thought I would write a kind little note to Gowing and Cummings\r\nabout last Sunday, and warning them against Mr. Stillbrook.  Afterwards,\r\nthinking the matter over, tore up the letters and determined not to\r\n_write_ at all, but to _speak_ quietly to them.  Dumfounded at receiving\r\na sharp letter from Cummings, saying that both he and Gowing had been\r\nwaiting for an explanation of _my_ (mind you, MY) extraordinary conduct\r\ncoming home on Sunday.  At last I wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was the aggrieved\r\nparty; but as I freely forgive you, you\xe2\x80\x94feeling yourself aggrieved\xe2\x80\x94should\r\nbestow forgiveness on me.\xe2\x80\x9d  I have copied this _verbatim_ in the diary,\r\nbecause I think it is one of the most perfect and thoughtful sentences I\r\nhave ever written.  I posted the letter, but in my own heart I felt I was\r\nactually apologising for having been insulted.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 18.\xe2\x80\x94Am in for a cold.  Spent the whole day at the office sneezing.\r\nIn the evening, the cold being intolerable, sent Sarah out for a bottle\r\nof Kinahan.  Fell asleep in the arm-chair, and woke with the shivers.\r\nWas startled by a loud knock at the front door.  Carrie awfully flurried.\r\nSarah still out, so went up, opened the door, and found it was only\r\nCummings.  Remembered the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy had again broken the side-bell.\r\nCummings squeezed my hand, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just seen Gowing.  All right.\r\nSay no more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no doubt they are both under the\r\nimpression I have apologised.\r\n\r\nWhile playing dominoes with Cummings in the parlour, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-by,\r\ndo you want any wine or spirits?  My cousin Merton has just set up in the\r\ntrade, and has a splendid whisky, four years in bottle, at thirty-eight\r\nshillings.  It is worth your while laying down a few dozen of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\ntold him my cellars, which were very small, were full up.  To my horror,\r\nat that very moment, Sarah entered the room, and putting a bottle of\r\nwhisky, wrapped in a dirty piece of newspaper, on the table in front of\r\nus, said: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, the grocer says he ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no more Kinahan, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find this very good at two-and-six, with twopence returned on the\r\nbottle; and, please, did you want any more sherry? as he has some at\r\none-and-three, as dry as a nut!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nA conversation with Mr. Merton on Society.  Mr. and Mrs. James, of\r\nSutton, come up.  A miserable evening at the Tank Theatre.  Experiments\r\nwith enamel paint.  I make another good joke; but Gowing and Cummings are\r\nunnecessarily offended.  I paint the bath red, with unexpected result.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 19.\xe2\x80\x94Cummings called, bringing with him his friend Merton, who is in\r\nthe wine trade.  Gowing also called.  Mr. Merton made himself at home at\r\nonce, and Carrie and I were both struck with him immediately, and\r\nthoroughly approved of his sentiments.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must take me as I am;\xe2\x80\x9d and I\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and you must take us as we are.  We\xe2\x80\x99re homely people, we\r\nare not swells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can see that,\xe2\x80\x9d and Gowing roared with laughter; but\r\nMerton in a most gentlemanly manner said to Gowing: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nquite understand me.  I intended to convey that our charming host and\r\nhostess were superior to the follies of fashion, and preferred leading a\r\nsimple and wholesome life to gadding about to twopenny-halfpenny\r\ntea-drinking afternoons, and living above their incomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was immensely pleased with these sensible remarks of Merton\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nconcluded that subject by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, candidly, Mr. Merton, we don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\ninto Society, because we do not care for it; and what with the expense of\r\ncabs here and cabs there, and white gloves and white ties, etc., it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem worth the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerton said in reference to _friends_: \xe2\x80\x9cMy motto is \xe2\x80\x98Few and True;\xe2\x80\x99 and,\r\nby the way, I also apply that to wine, \xe2\x80\x98Little and Good.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and sometimes \xe2\x80\x98cheap and tasty,\xe2\x80\x99 eh, old man?\xe2\x80\x9d  Merton, still\r\ncontinuing, said he should treat me as a friend, and put me down for a\r\ndozen of his \xe2\x80\x9cLockanbar\xe2\x80\x9d whisky, and as I was an old friend of Gowing, I\r\nshould have it for 36s., which was considerably under what he paid for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe booked his own order, and further said that at any time I wanted any\r\npasses for the theatre I was to let him know, as his name stood good for\r\nany theatre in London.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 20.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie reminded me that as her old school friend, Annie Fullers\r\n(now Mrs. James), and her husband had come up from Sutton for a few days,\r\nit would look kind to take them to the theatre, and would I drop a line\r\nto Mr. Merton asking him for passes for four, either for the Italian\r\nOpera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum.  I wrote Merton to that effect.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 21.\xe2\x80\x94Got a reply from Merton, saying he was very busy, and just at\r\npresent couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage passes for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy,\r\nor Lyceum, but the best thing going on in London was the _Brown Bushes_,\r\nat the Tank Theatre, Islington, and enclosed seats for four; also bill\r\nfor whisky.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 23.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. and Mrs. James (Miss Fullers that was) came to meat tea,\r\nand we left directly after for the Tank Theatre.  We got a \xe2\x80\x99bus that took\r\nus to King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross, and then changed into one that took us to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. James each time insisted on paying for all, saying that I\r\nhad paid for the tickets and that was quite enough.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at theatre, where, curiously enough, all our \xe2\x80\x99bus-load except\r\nan old woman with a basket seemed to be going in.  I walked ahead and\r\npresented the tickets.  The man looked at them, and called out: \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nWillowly! do you know anything about these?\xe2\x80\x9d holding up my tickets.  The\r\ngentleman called to, came up and examined my tickets, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWho gave\r\nyou these?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said, rather indignantly: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Merton, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d  He\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cMerton?  Who\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d  I answered, rather sharply: \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to\r\nknow, his name\xe2\x80\x99s good at any theatre in London.\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! is it?\r\nWell, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good here.  These tickets, which are not dated, were\r\nissued under Mr. Swinstead\xe2\x80\x99s management, which has since changed hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhile I was having some very unpleasant words with the man, James, who\r\nhad gone upstairs with the ladies, called out: \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d  I went up\r\nafter them, and a very civil attendant said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis way, please, box H.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said to James: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how on earth did you manage it?\xe2\x80\x9d and to my horror\r\nhe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, paid for it of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was humiliating enough, and I could scarcely follow the play, but I\r\nwas doomed to still further humiliation.  I was leaning out of the box,\r\nwhen my tie\xe2\x80\x94a little black bow which fastened on to the stud by means of\r\na new patent\xe2\x80\x94fell into the pit below.  A clumsy man not noticing it, had\r\nhis foot on it for ever so long before he discovered it.  He then picked\r\nit up and eventually flung it under the next seat in disgust.  What with\r\nthe box incident and the tie, I felt quite miserable.  Mr. James, of\r\nSutton, was very good.  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry\xe2\x80\x94no one will notice it with\r\nyour beard.  That is the only advantage of growing one that I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was no occasion for that remark, for Carrie is very proud of my\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nTo hide the absence of the tie I had to keep my chin down the rest of the\r\nevening, which caused a pain at the back of my neck.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 24.\xe2\x80\x94Could scarcely sleep a wink through thinking of having brought\r\nup Mr. and Mrs. James from the country to go to the theatre last night,\r\nand his having paid for a private box because our order was not honoured,\r\nand such a poor play too.  I wrote a very satirical letter to Merton, the\r\nwine merchant, who gave us the pass, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering we had to pay\r\nfor our seats, we did our best to appreciate the performance.\xe2\x80\x9d  I thought\r\nthis line rather cutting, and I asked Carrie how many p\xe2\x80\x99s there were in\r\nappreciate, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOne.\xe2\x80\x9d  After I sent off the letter I looked at\r\nthe dictionary and found there were two.  Awfully vexed at this.\r\n\r\nDecided not to worry myself any more about the James\xe2\x80\x99s; for, as Carrie\r\nwisely said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll make it all right with them by asking them up from\r\nSutton one evening next week to play at B\xc3\xa9zique.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAPRIL 25.\xe2\x80\x94In consequence of Brickwell telling me his wife was working\r\nwonders with the new Pinkford\xe2\x80\x99s enamel paint, I determined to try it.  I\r\nbought two tins of red on my way home.  I hastened through tea, went into\r\nthe garden and painted some flower-pots.  I called out Carrie, who said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve always got some newfangled craze;\xe2\x80\x9d but she was obliged to admit\r\nthat the flower-pots looked remarkably well.  Went upstairs into the\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom and painted her washstand, towel-horse, and chest of\r\ndrawers.  To my mind it was an extraordinary improvement, but as an\r\nexample of the ignorance of the lower classes in the matter of taste, our\r\nservant, Sarah, on seeing them, evinced no sign of pleasure, but merely\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cshe thought they looked very well as they was before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAPRIL 26.\xe2\x80\x94Got some more red enamel paint (red, to my mind, being the best\r\ncolour), and painted the coal-scuttle, and the backs of our _Shakspeare_,\r\nthe binding of which had almost worn out.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27.\xe2\x80\x94Painted the bath red, and was delighted with the result.  Sorry\r\nto say Carrie was not, in fact we had a few words about it.  She said I\r\nought to have consulted her, and she had never heard of such a thing as a\r\nbath being painted red.  I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s merely a matter of taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortunately, further argument on the subject was stopped by a voice\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d  It was only Cummings, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour maid\r\nopened the door, and asked me to excuse her showing me in, as she was\r\nwringing out some socks.\xe2\x80\x9d  I was delighted to see him, and suggested we\r\nshould have a game of whist with a dummy, and by way of merriment said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can be the dummy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cummings (I thought rather ill-naturedly)\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cFunny as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d  He said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop, he only called to\r\nleave me the _Bicycle News_, as he had done with it.\r\n\r\nAnother ring at the bell; it was Gowing, who said he \xe2\x80\x9cmust apologise for\r\ncoming so often, and that one of these days we must come round to _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cA very extraordinary thing has struck me.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cSomething funny, as\r\nusual,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cummings.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI think even you will say so\r\nthis time.  It\xe2\x80\x99s concerning you both; for doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem odd that\r\nGowing\xe2\x80\x99s always coming and Cummings\xe2\x80\x99 always going?\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie, who had\r\nevidently quite forgotten about the bath, went into fits of laughter, and\r\nas for myself, I fairly doubled up in my chair, till it cracked beneath\r\nme.  I think this was one of the best jokes I have ever made.\r\n\r\nThen imagine my astonishment on perceiving both Cummings and Gowing\r\nperfectly silent, and without a smile on their faces.  After rather an\r\nunpleasant pause, Cummings, who had opened a cigar-case, closed it up\r\nagain and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I think, after that, I _shall_ be going, and I am\r\nsorry I fail to see the fun of your jokes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind a\r\njoke when it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t rude, but a pun on a name, to his thinking, was\r\ncertainly a little wanting in good taste.  Cummings followed it up by\r\nsaying, if it had been said by anyone else but myself, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nentered the house again.  This rather unpleasantly terminated what might\r\nhave been a cheerful evening.  However, it was as well they went, for the\r\ncharwoman had finished up the remains of the cold pork.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 28.\xe2\x80\x94At the office, the new and very young clerk Pitt, who was very\r\nimpudent to me a week or so ago, was late again.  I told him it would be\r\nmy duty to inform Mr. Perkupp, the principal.  To my surprise, Pitt\r\napologised most humbly and in a most gentlemanly fashion.  I was\r\nunfeignedly pleased to notice this improvement in his manner towards me,\r\nand told him I would look over his unpunctuality.  Passing down the room\r\nan hour later.  I received a smart smack in the face from a rolled-up\r\nball of hard foolscap.  I turned round sharply, but all the clerks were\r\napparently riveted to their work.  I am not a rich man, but I would give\r\nhalf-a-sovereign to know whether that was thrown by accident or design.\r\nWent home early and bought some more enamel paint\xe2\x80\x94black this time\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nspent the evening touching up the fender, picture-frames, and an old pair\r\nof boots, making them look as good as new.  Also painted Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalking-stick, which he left behind, and made it look like ebony.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 29, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Woke up with a fearful headache and strong symptoms of\r\na cold.  Carrie, with a perversity which is just like her, said it was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpainter\xe2\x80\x99s colic,\xe2\x80\x9d and was the result of my having spent the last few\r\ndays with my nose over a paint-pot.  I told her firmly that I knew a\r\ngreat deal better what was the matter with me than she did.  I had got a\r\nchill, and decided to have a bath as hot as I could bear it.  Bath\r\nready\xe2\x80\x94could scarcely bear it so hot.  I persevered, and got in; very hot,\r\nbut very acceptable.  I lay still for some time.\r\n\r\nOn moving my hand above the surface of the water, I experienced the\r\ngreatest fright I ever received in the whole course of my life; for\r\nimagine my horror on discovering my hand, as I thought, full of blood.\r\nMy first thought was that I had ruptured an artery, and was bleeding to\r\ndeath, and should be discovered, later on, looking like a second Marat,\r\nas I remember seeing him in Madame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s.  My second thought was to\r\nring the bell, but remembered there was no bell to ring.  My third was,\r\nthat there was nothing but the enamel paint, which had dissolved with\r\nboiling water.  I stepped out of the bath, perfectly red all over,\r\nresembling the Red Indians I have seen depicted at an East-End theatre.\r\nI determined not to say a word to Carrie, but to tell Farmerson to come\r\non Monday and paint the bath white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ball at the Mansion House.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 30.\xe2\x80\x94Perfectly astounded at receiving an invitation for Carrie and\r\nmyself from the Lord and Lady Mayoress to the Mansion House, to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet the\r\nRepresentatives of Trades and Commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  My heart beat like that of a\r\nschoolboy\xe2\x80\x99s.  Carrie and I read the invitation over two or three times.\r\nI could scarcely eat my breakfast.  I said\xe2\x80\x94and I felt it from the bottom\r\nof my heart,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCarrie darling, I was a proud man when I led you down the\r\naisle of the church on our wedding-day; that pride will be equalled, if\r\nnot surpassed, when I lead my dear, pretty wife up to the Lord and Lady\r\nMayoress at the Mansion House.\xe2\x80\x9d  I saw the tears in Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and\r\nshe said: \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie dear, it is _I_ who have to be proud of you.  And I am\r\nvery, very proud of you.  You have called me pretty; and as long as I am\r\npretty in your eyes, I am happy.  You, dear old Charlie, are not\r\nhandsome, but you are _good_, which is far more noble.\xe2\x80\x9d  I gave her a\r\nkiss, and she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if there will be any dancing?  I have not\r\ndanced with you for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cannot tell what induced me to do it, but I seized her round the waist,\r\nand we were silly enough to be executing a wild kind of polka when Sarah\r\nentered, grinning, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a man, mum, at the door who wants\r\nto know if you want any good coals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most annoyed at this.  Spent the\r\nevening in answering, and tearing up again, the reply to the Mansion\r\nHouse, having left word with Sarah if Gowing or Cummings called we were\r\nnot at home.  Must consult Mr. Perkupp how to answer the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nMAY 1.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to send mother the invitation to look\r\nat.\xe2\x80\x9d  I consented, as soon as I had answered it.  I told Mr. Perkupp, at\r\nthe office, with a feeling of pride, that we had received an invitation\r\nto the Mansion House; and he said, to my astonishment, that he himself\r\ngave in my name to the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s secretary.  I felt this rather\r\ndiscounted the value of the invitation, but I thanked him; and in reply\r\nto me, he described how I was to answer it.  I felt the reply was too\r\nsimple; but of course Mr. Perkupp knows best.\r\n\r\nMAY 2.\xe2\x80\x94Sent my dress-coat and trousers to the little tailor\xe2\x80\x99s round the\r\ncorner, to have the creases taken out.  Told Gowing not to call next\r\nMonday, as we were going to the Mansion House.  Sent similar note to\r\nCummings.\r\n\r\nMAY 3.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie went to Mrs. James, at Sutton, to consult about her dress\r\nfor next Monday.  While speaking incidentally to Spotch, one of our head\r\nclerks, about the Mansion House, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m asked, but don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nI shall go.\xe2\x80\x9d  When a vulgar man like Spotch is asked, I feel my\r\ninvitation is considerably discounted.  In the evening, while I was out,\r\nthe little tailor brought round my coat and trousers, and because Sarah\r\nhad not a shilling to pay for the pressing, he took them away again.\r\n\r\nMAY 4.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s mother returned the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, which was\r\nsent to her to look at, with apologies for having upset a glass of port\r\nover it.  I was too angry to say anything.\r\n\r\nMAY 5.\xe2\x80\x94Bought a pair of lavender kid-gloves for next Monday, and two\r\nwhite ties, in case one got spoiled in the tying.\r\n\r\nMAY 6, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94A very dull sermon, during which, I regret to say, I twice\r\nthought of the Mansion House reception to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMAY 7.\xe2\x80\x94A big red-letter day; viz., the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s reception.  The whole\r\nhouse upset.  I had to get dressed at half-past six, as Carrie wanted the\r\nroom to herself.  Mrs. James had come up from Sutton to help Carrie; so I\r\ncould not help thinking it unreasonable that she should require the\r\nentire attention of Sarah, the servant, as well.  Sarah kept running out\r\nof the house to fetch \xe2\x80\x9csomething for missis,\xe2\x80\x9d and several times I had, in\r\nmy full evening-dress, to answer the back-door.\r\n\r\nThe last time it was the greengrocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy, who, not seeing it was me,\r\nfor Sarah had not lighted the gas, pushed into my hands two cabbages and\r\nhalf-a-dozen coal-blocks.  I indignantly threw them on the ground, and\r\nfelt so annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy\xe2\x80\x99s ears.  He\r\nwent away crying, and said he should summons me, a thing I would not have\r\nhappen for the world.  In the dark, I stepped on a piece of the cabbage,\r\nwhich brought me down on the flags all of a heap.  For a moment I was\r\nstunned, but when I recovered I crawled upstairs into the drawing-room\r\nand on looking into the chimney-glass discovered that my chin was\r\nbleeding, my shirt smeared with the coal-blocks, and my left trouser torn\r\nat the knee.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mrs. James brought me down another shirt, which I changed in the\r\ndrawing-room.  I put a piece of court-plaster on my chin, and Sarah very\r\nneatly sewed up the tear at the knee.  At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock Carrie swept into\r\nthe room, looking like a queen.  Never have I seen her look so lovely, or\r\nso distinguished.  She was wearing a satin dress of sky-blue\xe2\x80\x94my favourite\r\ncolour\xe2\x80\x94and a piece of lace, which Mrs. James lent her, round the\r\nshoulders, to give a finish.  I thought perhaps the dress was a little\r\ntoo long behind, and decidedly too short in front, but Mrs. James said it\r\nwas _\xc3\xa0 la mode_.  Mrs. James was most kind, and lent Carrie a fan of\r\nivory with red feathers, the value of which, she said, was priceless, as\r\nthe feathers belonged to the Kachu eagle\xe2\x80\x94a bird now extinct.  I preferred\r\nthe little white fan which Carrie bought for three-and-six at\r\nShoolbred\xe2\x80\x99s, but both ladies sat on me at once.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the Mansion House too early, which was rather fortunate,\r\nfor I had an opportunity of speaking to his lordship, who graciously\r\ncondescended to talk with me some minutes; but I must say I was\r\ndisappointed to find he did not even know Mr. Perkupp, our principal.\r\n\r\nI felt as if we had been invited to the Mansion House by one who did not\r\nknow the Lord Mayor himself.  Crowds arrived, and I shall never forget\r\nthe grand sight.  My humble pen can never describe it.  I was a little\r\nannoyed with Carrie, who kept saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a pity we don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce she quite lost her head.  I saw someone who looked like Franching,\r\nfrom Peckham, and was moving towards him when she seized me by the\r\ncoat-tails, and said quite loudly: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me,\xe2\x80\x9d which caused an\r\nelderly gentleman, in a court-suit, and a chain round him, and two\r\nladies, to burst out laughing.  There was an immense crowd in the\r\nsupper-room, and, my stars! it was a splendid supper\xe2\x80\x94any amount of\r\nchampagne.\r\n\r\nCarrie made a most hearty supper, for which I was pleased; for I\r\nsometimes think she is not strong.  There was scarcely a dish she did not\r\ntaste.  I was so thirsty, I could not eat much.  Receiving a sharp slap\r\non the shoulder, I turned, and, to my amazement, saw Farmerson, our\r\nironmonger.  He said, in the most familiar way: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is better than\r\nBrickfield Terrace, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d  I simply looked at him, and said coolly: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever expected to see you here.\xe2\x80\x9d  He said, with a loud, coarse laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlike that\xe2\x80\x94if _you_, why not _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d  I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d I wish I\r\ncould have thought of something better to say.  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cCan I get your\r\ngood lady anything?\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d for which I was\r\npleased.  I said, by way of reproof to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou never sent to-day to\r\npaint the bath, as I requested.\xe2\x80\x9d  Farmerson said: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Mr. Pooter,\r\nno shop when we\xe2\x80\x99re in company, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could think of a reply, one of the sheriffs, in full Court\r\ncostume, slapped Farmerson on the back and hailed him as an old friend,\r\nand asked him to dine with him at his lodge.  I was astonished.  For full\r\nfive minutes they stood roaring with laughter, and stood digging each\r\nother in the ribs.  They kept telling each other they didn\xe2\x80\x99t look a day\r\nolder.  They began embracing each other and drinking champagne.\r\n\r\nTo think that a man who mends our scraper should know any member of our\r\naristocracy!  I was just moving with Carrie, when Farmerson seized me\r\nrather roughly by the collar, and addressing the sheriff, said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\nintroduce my neighbour, Pooter.\xe2\x80\x9d  He did not even say \xe2\x80\x9cMister.\xe2\x80\x9d  The\r\nsheriff handed me a glass of champagne.  I felt, after all, it was a\r\ngreat honour to drink a glass of wine with him, and I told him so.  We\r\nstood chatting for some time, and at last I said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse me now\r\nif I join Mrs. Pooter.\xe2\x80\x9d  When I approached her, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\ntake you away from friends.  I am quite happy standing here alone in a\r\ncrowd, knowing nobody!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs it takes two to make a quarrel, and as it was neither the time nor the\r\nplace for it, I gave my arm to Carrie, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope my darling\r\nlittle wife will dance with me, if only for the sake of saying we had\r\ndanced at the Mansion House as guests of the Lord Mayor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Finding the\r\ndancing after supper was less formal, and knowing how much Carrie used to\r\nadmire my dancing in the days gone by, I put my arm round her waist and\r\nwe commenced a waltz.\r\n\r\nA most unfortunate accident occurred.  I had got on a new pair of boots.\r\nFoolishly, I had omitted to take Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s advice; namely, to scratch the\r\nsoles of them with the points of the scissors or to put a little wet on\r\nthem.  I had scarcely started when, like lightning, my left foot slipped\r\naway and I came down, the side of my head striking the floor with such\r\nviolence that for a second or two I did not know what had happened.  I\r\nneedly hardly say that Carrie fell with me with equal violence, breaking\r\nthe comb in her hair and grazing her elbow.\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter, which was immediately checked when people\r\nfound that we had really hurt ourselves.  A gentleman assisted Carrie to\r\na seat, and I expressed myself pretty strongly on the danger of having a\r\nplain polished floor with no carpet or drugget to prevent people\r\nslipping.  The gentleman, who said his name was Darwitts, insisted on\r\nescorting Carrie to have a glass of wine, an invitation which I was\r\npleased to allow Carrie to accept.\r\n\r\nI followed, and met Farmerson, who immediately said, in his loud voice\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, are you the one who went down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered with an indignant look.\r\n\r\nWith execrable taste, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, old man, we are too old for\r\nthis game.  We must leave these capers to the youngsters.  Come and have\r\nanother glass, that is more in our line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough I felt I was buying his silence by accepting, we followed the\r\nothers into the supper-room.\r\n\r\nNeither Carrie nor I, after our unfortunate mishap, felt inclined to stay\r\nlonger.  As we were departing, Farmerson said: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going? if so, you\r\nmight give me a lift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it better to consent, but wish I had first consulted Carrie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Mansion House Ball.  Carrie offended.  Gowing also offended.  A\r\npleasant party at the Cummings\xe2\x80\x99.  Mr. Franching, of Peckham, visits us.\r\n\r\nMAY 8.\xe2\x80\x94I woke up with a most terrible headache.  I could scarcely see,\r\nand the back of my neck was as if I had given it a crick.  I thought\r\nfirst of sending for a doctor; but I did not think it necessary.  When\r\nup, I felt faint, and went to Brownish\xe2\x80\x99s, the chemist, who gave me a\r\ndraught.  So bad at the office, had to get leave to come home.  Went to\r\nanother chemist in the City, and I got a draught.  Brownish\xe2\x80\x99s dose seems\r\nto have made me worse; have eaten nothing all day.  To make matters\r\nworse, Carrie, every time I spoke to her, answered me sharply\xe2\x80\x94that is,\r\nwhen she answered at all.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I felt very much worse again and said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nbelieve I\xe2\x80\x99ve been poisoned by the lobster mayonnaise at the Mansion House\r\nlast night;\xe2\x80\x9d she simply replied, without taking her eyes from her sewing:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChampagne never did agree with you.\xe2\x80\x9d  I felt irritated, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nnonsense you talk; I only had a glass and a half, and you know as well as\r\nI do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  Before I could complete the sentence she bounced out of the room.\r\nI sat over an hour waiting for her to return; but as she did not, I\r\ndetermined I would go to bed.  I discovered Carrie had gone to bed\r\nwithout even saying \xe2\x80\x9cgood-night\xe2\x80\x9d; leaving me to bar the scullery door and\r\nfeed the cat.  I shall certainly speak to her about this in the morning.\r\n\r\nMAY 9.\xe2\x80\x94Still a little shaky, with black specks.  The _Blackfriars\r\nBi-weekly News_ contains a long list of the guests at the Mansion House\r\nBall.  Disappointed to find our names omitted, though Farmerson\xe2\x80\x99s is in\r\nplainly enough with M.L.L. after it, whatever that may mean.  More than\r\nvexed, because we had ordered a dozen copies to send to our friends.\r\nWrote to the _Blackfriars Bi-weekly News_, pointing out their omission.\r\n\r\nCarrie had commenced her breakfast when I entered the parlour.  I helped\r\nmyself to a cup of tea, and I said, perfectly calmly and quietly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarrie, I wish a little explanation of your conduct last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! and I desire something more than a little\r\nexplanation of your conduct the night before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, coolly: \xe2\x80\x9cReally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie said sneeringly: \xe2\x80\x9cProbably not; you were scarcely in a condition\r\nto understand anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was astounded at this insinuation and simply ejaculated: \xe2\x80\x9cCaroline!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be theatrical, it has no effect on me.  Reserve that\r\ntone for your new friend, Mister Farmerson, the ironmonger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to speak, when Carrie, in a temper such as I have never seen\r\nher in before, told me to hold my tongue.  She said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ going to\r\nsay something!  After professing to snub Mr. Farmerson, you permit him to\r\nsnub _you_, in my presence, and then accept his invitation to take a\r\nglass of champagne with you, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t limit yourself to one glass.\r\nYou then offer this vulgar man, who made a bungle of repairing our\r\nscraper, a seat in our cab on the way home.  I say nothing about his\r\ntearing my dress in getting in the cab, nor of treading on Mrs. James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpensive fan, which you knocked out of my hand, and for which he never\r\neven apologised; but you smoked all the way home without having the\r\ndecency to ask my permission.  That is not all!  At the end of the\r\njourney, although he did not offer you a farthing towards his share of\r\nthe cab, you asked him in.  Fortunately, he was sober enough to detect,\r\nfrom my manner, that his company was not desirable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoodness knows I felt humiliated enough at this; but, to make matters\r\nworse, Gowing entered the room, without knocking, with two hats on his\r\nhead and holding the garden-rake in his hand, with Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s fur tippet\r\n(which he had taken off the downstairs hall-peg) round his neck, and\r\nannounced himself in a loud, coarse voice: \xe2\x80\x9cHis Royal Highness, the Lord\r\nMayor!\xe2\x80\x9d  He marched twice round the room like a buffoon, and finding we\r\ntook no notice, said: \xe2\x80\x9cHulloh! what\xe2\x80\x99s up?  Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 quarrel, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence for a moment, so I said quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Gowing, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot very well, and not quite in the humour for joking; especially when\r\nyou enter the room without knocking, an act which I fail to see the fun\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, but I called for my stick, which I thought\r\nyou would have sent round.\xe2\x80\x9d  I handed him his stick, which I remembered I\r\nhad painted black with the enamel paint, thinking to improve it.  He\r\nlooked at it for a minute with a dazed expression and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWho did\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cEh, did what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cDid what?  Why, destroyed my stick!  It belonged to my poor\r\nuncle, and I value it more than anything I have in the world!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll know\r\nwho did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry.  I dare say it will come off.  I did it for the\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cThen all I can say is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a confounded liberty; and I\r\n_would_ add, you\xe2\x80\x99re a bigger fool than you look, only _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ absolutely\r\nimpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMAY 12.\xe2\x80\x94Got a single copy of the _Blackfriars Bi-weekly News_.  There was\r\na short list of several names they had omitted; but the stupid people had\r\nmentioned our names as \xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. C. Porter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most annoying!  Wrote\r\nagain and I took particular care to write our name in capital letters,\r\n_POOTER_, so that there should be no possible mistake this time.\r\n\r\nMAY 16.\xe2\x80\x94Absolutely disgusted on opening the _Blackfriars Bi-weekly News_\r\nof to-day, to find the following paragraph: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have received two letters\r\nfrom Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pewter, requesting us to announce the important\r\nfact that they were at the Mansion House Ball.\xe2\x80\x9d  I tore up the paper and\r\nthrew it in the waste-paper basket.  My time is far too valuable to\r\nbother about such trifles.\r\n\r\nMAY 21.\xe2\x80\x94The last week or ten days terribly dull, Carrie being away at\r\nMrs. James\xe2\x80\x99s, at Sutton.  Cummings also away.  Gowing, I presume, is\r\nstill offended with me for black enamelling his stick without asking him.\r\n\r\nMAY 22.\xe2\x80\x94Purchased a new stick mounted with silver, which cost\r\nseven-and-sixpence (shall tell Carrie five shillings), and sent it round\r\nwith nice note to Gowing.\r\n\r\nMAY 23.\xe2\x80\x94Received strange note from Gowing; he said: \xe2\x80\x9cOffended? not a bit,\r\nmy boy\xe2\x80\x94I thought you were offended with me for losing my temper.\r\nBesides, I found after all, it was not my poor old uncle\xe2\x80\x99s stick you\r\npainted.  It was only a shilling thing I bought at a tobacconist\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHowever, I am much obliged to you for your handsome present all same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMAY 24.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie back.  Hoorah!  She looks wonderfully well, except that\r\nthe sun has caught her nose.\r\n\r\nMAY 25.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie brought down some of my shirts and advised me to take them\r\nto Trillip\xe2\x80\x99s round the corner.  She said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fronts and cuffs are much\r\nfrayed.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _\xe2\x80\x99frayed_ they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLor! how we roared.  I thought we should never stop laughing.  As I\r\nhappened to be sitting next the driver going to town on the \xe2\x80\x99bus, I told\r\nhim my joke about the \xe2\x80\x9cfrayed\xe2\x80\x9d shirts.  I thought he would have rolled\r\noff his seat.  They laughed at the office a good bit too over it.\r\n\r\nMAY 26.\xe2\x80\x94Left the shirts to be repaired at Trillip\xe2\x80\x99s.  I said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n_\xe2\x80\x99fraid_ they are _frayed_.\xe2\x80\x9d  He said, without a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re bound to\r\ndo that, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d  Some people seem to be quite destitute of a sense of\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\nJUNE 1.\xe2\x80\x94The last week has been like old times, Carrie being back, and\r\nGowing and Cummings calling every evening nearly.  Twice we sat out in\r\nthe garden quite late.  This evening we were like a pack of children, and\r\nplayed \xe2\x80\x9cconsequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a good game.\r\n\r\nJUNE 2.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cConsequences\xe2\x80\x9d again this evening.  Not quite so successful as\r\nlast night; Gowing having several times overstepped the limits of good\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nJUNE 4.\xe2\x80\x94In the evening Carrie and I went round to Mr. and Mrs. Cummings\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto spend a quiet evening with them.  Gowing was there, also Mr.\r\nStillbrook.  It was quiet but pleasant.  Mrs. Cummings sang five or six\r\nsongs, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Garden of Sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d being best in my humble\r\njudgment; but what pleased me most was the duet she sang with\r\nCarrie\xe2\x80\x94classical duet, too.  I think it is called, \xe2\x80\x9cI would that my\r\nlove!\xe2\x80\x9d  It was beautiful.  If Carrie had been in better voice, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink professionals could have sung it better.  After supper we made them\r\nsing it again.  I never liked Mr. Stillbrook since the walk that Sunday\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x9cCow and Hedge,\xe2\x80\x9d but I must say he sings comic-songs well.  His\r\nsong: \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t Want the old men now,\xe2\x80\x9d made us shriek with laughter,\r\nespecially the verse referring to Mr. Gladstone; but there was one verse\r\nI think he might have omitted, and I said so, but Gowing thought it was\r\nthe best of the lot.\r\n\r\nJUNE 6.\xe2\x80\x94Trillip brought round the shirts and, to my disgust, his charge\r\nfor repairing was more than I gave for them when new.  I told him so, and\r\nhe impertinently replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they are better now than when they were\r\nnew.\xe2\x80\x9d  I paid him, and said it was a robbery.  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wanted\r\nyour shirt-fronts made out of pauper-linen, such as is used for packing\r\nand bookbinding, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJUNE 7.\xe2\x80\x94A dreadful annoyance.  Met Mr. Franching, who lives at Peckham,\r\nand who is a great swell in his way.  I ventured to ask him to come home\r\nto meat-tea, and take pot-luck.  I did not think he would accept such a\r\nhumble invitation; but he did, saying, in a most friendly way, he would\r\nrather \xe2\x80\x9cpeck\xe2\x80\x9d with us than by himself.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe had better get into\r\nthis blue \xe2\x80\x99bus.\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo blue-bussing for me.  I have had enough\r\nof the blues lately.  I lost a cool \xe2\x80\x98thou\xe2\x80\x99 over the Copper Scare.  Step\r\nin here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe drove up home in style, in a hansom-cab, and I knocked three times at\r\nthe front door without getting an answer.  I saw Carrie, through the\r\npanels of ground-glass (with stars), rushing upstairs.  I told Mr.\r\nFranching to wait at the door while I went round to the side.  There I\r\nsaw the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy actually picking off the paint on the door, which\r\nhad formed into blisters.  No time to reprove him; so went round and\r\neffected an entrance through the kitchen window.  I let in Mr. Franching,\r\nand showed him into the drawing-room.  I went upstairs to Carrie, who was\r\nchanging her dress, and told her I had persuaded Mr. Franching to come\r\nhome.  She replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you do such a thing?  You know it\xe2\x80\x99s Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nholiday, and there\xe2\x80\x99s not a thing in the house, the cold mutton having\r\nturned with the hot weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEventually Carrie, like a good creature as she is, slipped down, washed\r\nup the teacups, and laid the cloth, and I gave Franching our views of\r\nJapan to look at while I ran round to the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s to get three chops.\r\n\r\nJULY 30.\xe2\x80\x94The miserable cold weather is either upsetting me or Carrie, or\r\nboth.  We seem to break out into an argument about absolutely nothing,\r\nand this unpleasant state of things usually occurs at meal-times.\r\n\r\nThis morning, for some unaccountable reason, we were talking about\r\nballoons, and we were as merry as possible; but the conversation drifted\r\ninto family matters, during which Carrie, without the slightest reason,\r\nreferred in the most uncomplimentary manner to my poor father\xe2\x80\x99s pecuniary\r\ntrouble.  I retorted by saying that \xe2\x80\x9cPa, at all events, was a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhereupon Carrie burst out crying.  I positively could not eat any\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nAt the office I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, who said he was very sorry,\r\nbut I should have to take my annual holidays from next Saturday.\r\nFranching called at office and asked me to dine at his club, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nConstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fearing disagreeables at home after the \xe2\x80\x9ctiff\xe2\x80\x9d this\r\nmorning, I sent a telegram to Carrie, telling her I was going out to dine\r\nand she was not to sit up.  Bought a little silver bangle for Carrie.\r\n\r\nJULY 31.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie was very pleased with the bangle, which I left with an\r\naffectionate note on her dressing-table last night before going to bed.\r\nI told Carrie we should have to start for our holiday next Saturday.  She\r\nreplied quite happily that she did not mind, except that the weather was\r\nso bad, and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get her a\r\nseaside dress in time.  I told Carrie that I thought the drab one with\r\npink bows looked quite good enough; and Carrie said she should not think\r\nof wearing it.  I was about to discuss the matter, when, remembering the\r\nargument yesterday, resolved to hold my tongue.\r\n\r\nI said to Carrie: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can do better than \xe2\x80\x98Good old\r\nBroadstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie not only, to my astonishment, raised an objection\r\nto Broadstairs, for the first time; but begged me not to use the\r\nexpression, \xe2\x80\x9cGood old,\xe2\x80\x9d but to leave it to Mr. Stillbrook and other\r\n_gentlemen_ of his type.  Hearing my \xe2\x80\x99bus pass the window, I was obliged\r\nto rush out of the house without kissing Carrie as usual; and I shouted\r\nto her: \xe2\x80\x9cI leave it to you to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d  On returning in the evening,\r\nCarrie said she thought as the time was so short she had decided on\r\nBroadstairs, and had written to Mrs. Beck, Harbour View Terrace, for\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1.\xe2\x80\x94Ordered a new pair of trousers at Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s, and told them not\r\nto cut them so loose over the boot; the last pair being so loose and also\r\ntight at the knee, looked like a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s, and I heard Pitt, that\r\nobjectionable youth at the office, call out \xe2\x80\x9cHornpipe\xe2\x80\x9d as I passed his\r\ndesk.  Carrie has ordered of Miss Jibbons a pink Garibaldi and blue-serge\r\nskirt, which I always think looks so pretty at the seaside.  In the\r\nevening she trimmed herself a little sailor-hat, while I read to her the\r\n_Exchange and Mart_.  We had a good laugh over my trying on the hat when\r\nshe had finished it; Carrie saying it looked so funny with my beard, and\r\nhow the people would have roared if I went on the stage like it.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 2.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Beck wrote to say we could have our usual rooms at\r\nBroadstairs.  That\xe2\x80\x99s off our mind.  Bought a coloured shirt and a pair of\r\ntan-coloured boots, which I see many of the swell clerks wearing in the\r\nCity, and hear are all the \xe2\x80\x9cgo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAUGUST 3.\xe2\x80\x94A beautiful day.  Looking forward to to-morrow.  Carrie bought\r\na parasol about five feet long.  I told her it was ridiculous.  She said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. James, of Sutton, has one twice as long so;\xe2\x80\x9d the matter dropped.  I\r\nbought a capital hat for hot weather at the seaside.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nit is called, but it is the shape of the helmet worn in India, only made\r\nof straw.  Got three new ties, two coloured handkerchiefs, and a pair of\r\nnavy-blue socks at Pope Brothers.  Spent the evening packing.  Carrie\r\ntold me not to forget to borrow Mr. Higgsworth\xe2\x80\x99s telescope, which he\r\nalways lends me, knowing I know how to take care of it.  Sent Sarah out\r\nfor it.  While everything was seeming so bright, the last post brought us\r\na letter from Mrs. Beck, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI have just let all my house to one\r\nparty, and am sorry I must take back my words, and am sorry you must find\r\nother apartments; but Mrs. Womming, next door, will be pleased to\r\naccommodate you, but she cannot take you before Monday, as her rooms are\r\nengaged Bank Holiday week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unexpected Arrival Home of our Son, Willie Lupin Pooter.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 4.\xe2\x80\x94The first post brought a nice letter from our dear son Willie,\r\nacknowledging a trifling present which Carrie sent him, the day before\r\nyesterday being his twentieth birthday.  To our utter amazement he turned\r\nup himself in the afternoon, having journeyed all the way from Oldham.\r\nHe said he had got leave from the bank, and as Monday was a holiday he\r\nthought he would give us a little surprise.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 5, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94We have not seen Willie since last Christmas, and are\r\npleased to notice what a fine young man he has grown.  One would scarcely\r\nbelieve he was Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s son.  He looks more like a younger brother.  I\r\nrather disapprove of his wearing a check suit on a Sunday, and I think he\r\nought to have gone to church this morning; but he said he was tired after\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s journey, so I refrained from any remark on the subject.  We\r\nhad a bottle of port for dinner, and drank dear Willie\xe2\x80\x99s health.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, by-the-by, did I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99ve cut my first name,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98William,\xe2\x80\x99 and taken the second name \xe2\x80\x98Lupin\xe2\x80\x99?  In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m only known at\r\nOldham as \xe2\x80\x98Lupin Pooter.\xe2\x80\x99  If you were to \xe2\x80\x98Willie\xe2\x80\x99 me there, they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course, Lupin being a purely family name, Carrie was delighted, and\r\nbegan by giving a long history of the Lupins.  I ventured to say that I\r\nthought William a nice simple name, and reminded him he was christened\r\nafter his Uncle William, who was much respected in the City.  Willie, in\r\na manner which I did not much care for, said sneeringly: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know all\r\nabout that\xe2\x80\x94Good old Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d and helped himself to a third glass of port.\r\n\r\nCarrie objected strongly to my saying \xe2\x80\x9cGood old,\xe2\x80\x9d but she made no remark\r\nwhen Willie used the double adjective.  I said nothing, but looked at\r\nher, which meant more.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Willie, I hope you are happy\r\nwith your colleagues at the Bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin, if you please;\r\nand with respect to the Bank, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a clerk who is a gentleman, and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98boss\xe2\x80\x99 is a cad.\xe2\x80\x9d  I felt so shocked, I could say nothing, and my\r\ninstinct told me there was something wrong.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 6, Bank Holiday.\xe2\x80\x94As there was no sign of Lupin moving at nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, I knocked at his door, and said we usually breakfasted at\r\nhalf-past eight, and asked how long would he be?  Lupin replied that he\r\nhad had a lively time of it, first with the train shaking the house all\r\nnight, and then with the sun streaming in through the window in his eyes,\r\nand giving him a cracking headache.  Carrie came up and asked if he would\r\nlike some breakfast sent up, and he said he could do with a cup of tea,\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything to eat.\r\n\r\nLupin not having come down, I went up again at half-past one, and said we\r\ndined at two; he said he \xe2\x80\x9cwould be there.\xe2\x80\x9d  He never came down till a\r\nquarter to three.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have not seen much of you, and you will\r\nhave to return by the 5.30 train; therefore you will have to leave in an\r\nhour, unless you go by the midnight mail.\xe2\x80\x9d  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Guv\xe2\x80\x99nor,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s no use beating about the bush.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve tendered my resignation at the\r\nBank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment I could not speak.  When my speech came again, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ndare you, sir?  How dare you take such a serious step without consulting\r\nme?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me, sir!\xe2\x80\x94you will sit down immediately, and write a\r\nnote at my dictation, withdrawing your resignation and amply apologising\r\nfor your thoughtlessness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImagine my dismay when he replied with a loud guffaw: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use.  If\r\nyou want the good old truth, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the chuck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAUGUST 7.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Perkupp has given me leave to postpone my holiday a week,\r\nas we could not get the room.  This will give us an opportunity of trying\r\nto find an appointment for Willie before we go.  The ambition of my life\r\nwould be to get him into Mr. Perkupp\xe2\x80\x99s firm.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 11.\xe2\x80\x94Although it is a serious matter having our boy Lupin on our\r\nhands, still it is satisfactory to know he was asked to resign from the\r\nBank simply because \xe2\x80\x9che took no interest in his work, and always arrived\r\nan hour (sometimes two hours) late.\xe2\x80\x9d  We can all start off on Monday to\r\nBroadstairs with a light heart.  This will take my mind off the worry of\r\nthe last few days, which have been wasted over a useless correspondence\r\nwith the manager of the Bank at Oldham.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 13.\xe2\x80\x94Hurrah! at Broadstairs.  Very nice apartments near the\r\nstation.  On the cliffs they would have been double the price.  The\r\nlandlady had a nice five o\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner and tea ready, which we all\r\nenjoyed, though Lupin seemed fastidious because there happened to be a\r\nfly in the butter.  It was very wet in the evening, for which I was\r\nthankful, as it was a good excuse for going to bed early.  Lupin said he\r\nwould sit up and read a bit.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 14.\xe2\x80\x94I was a little annoyed to find Lupin, instead of reading last\r\nnight, had gone to a common sort of entertainment, given at the Assembly\r\nRooms.  I expressed my opinion that such performances were unworthy of\r\nrespectable patronage; but he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was only \xe2\x80\x98for one night\r\nonly.\xe2\x80\x99  I had a fit of the blues come on, and thought I would go to see\r\nPolly Presswell, England\xe2\x80\x99s Particular Spark.\xe2\x80\x9d  I told him I was proud to\r\nsay I had never heard of her.  Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo let the boy alone.  He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite old enough to take care of himself, and won\xe2\x80\x99t forget he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman.  Remember, you were young once yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rained all day\r\nhard, but Lupin would go out.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 15.\xe2\x80\x94Cleared up a bit, so we all took the train to Margate, and the\r\nfirst person we met on the jetty was Gowing.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cHulloh!  I thought\r\nyou had gone to Barmouth with your Birmingham friends?\xe2\x80\x9d  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nbut young Peter Lawrence was so ill, they postponed their visit, so I\r\ncame down here.  You know the Cummings\xe2\x80\x99 are here too?\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nthat will be delightful!  We must have some evenings together and have\r\ngames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI introduced Lupin, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be pleased to find we have our dear\r\nboy at home!\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?  You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say he\xe2\x80\x99s left\r\nthe Bank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI changed the subject quickly, and thereby avoided any of those awkward\r\nquestions which Gowing always has a knack of asking.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 16.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin positively refused to walk down the Parade with me\r\nbecause I was wearing my new straw helmet with my frock-coat.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what the boy is coming to.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 17.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin not falling in with our views, Carrie and I went for a\r\nsail.  It was a relief to be with her alone; for when Lupin irritates me,\r\nshe always sides with him.  On our return, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Shilling Emetic,\xe2\x80\x99 have you?  You\xe2\x80\x99ll come to six-pennorth on the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Liver Jerker\xe2\x80\x99 next.\xe2\x80\x9d  I presume he meant a tricycle, but I affected not\r\nto understand him.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 18.\xe2\x80\x94Gowing and Cummings walked over to arrange an evening at\r\nMargate.  It being wet, Gowing asked Cummings to accompany him to the\r\nhotel and have a game of billiards, knowing I never play, and in fact\r\ndisapprove of the game.  Cummings said he must hasten back to Margate;\r\nwhereupon Lupin, to my horror, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a game, Gowing\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhundred up.  A walk round the cloth will give me an appetite for dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Mister Gowing does not care to play with boys.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing\r\nsurprised me by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I do, if they play well,\xe2\x80\x9d and they\r\nwalked off together.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 19, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94I was about to read Lupin a sermon on smoking (which\r\nhe indulges in violently) and billiards, but he put on his hat and walked\r\nout.  Carrie then read _me_ a long sermon on the palpable inadvisability\r\nof treating Lupin as if he were a mere child.  I felt she was somewhat\r\nright, so in the evening I offered him a cigar.  He seemed pleased, but,\r\nafter a few whiffs, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a good old tup\xe2\x80\x99ny\xe2\x80\x94try one of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he handed me a cigar as long as it was strong, which is saying a good\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 20.\xe2\x80\x94I am glad our last day at the seaside was fine, though clouded\r\noverhead.  We went over to Cummings\xe2\x80\x99 (at Margate) in the evening, and as\r\nit was cold, we stayed in and played games; Gowing, as usual,\r\noverstepping the mark.  He suggested we should play \xe2\x80\x9cCutlets,\xe2\x80\x9d a game we\r\nnever heard of.  He sat on a chair, and asked Carrie to sit on his lap,\r\nan invitation which dear Carrie rightly declined.\r\n\r\nAfter some species of wrangling, I sat on Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s knees and Carrie sat\r\non the edge of mine.  Lupin sat on the edge of Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s lap, then\r\nCummings on Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s, and Mrs. Cummings on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s.  We looked very\r\nridiculous, and laughed a good deal.\r\n\r\nGowing then said: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a believer in the Great Mogul?\xe2\x80\x9d  We had to\r\nanswer all together: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94oh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d (three times).  Gowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cSo am\r\nI,\xe2\x80\x9d and suddenly got up.  The result of this stupid joke was that we all\r\nfell on the ground, and poor Carrie banged her head against the corner of\r\nthe fender.  Mrs. Cummings put some vinegar on; but through this we\r\nmissed the last train, and had to drive back to Broadstairs, which cost\r\nme seven-and-sixpence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nHome again.  Mrs. James\xe2\x80\x99 influence on Carrie.  Can get nothing for Lupin.\r\nNext-door neighbours are a little troublesome.  Some one tampers with my\r\ndiary.  Got a place for Lupin.  Lupin startles us with an announcement.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 22.\xe2\x80\x94Home sweet Home again!  Carrie bought some pretty blue-wool\r\nmats to stand vases on.  Fripps, Janus and Co. write to say they are\r\nsorry they have no vacancy among their staff of clerks for Lupin.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 23.\xe2\x80\x94I bought a pair of stags\xe2\x80\x99 heads made of plaster-of-Paris and\r\ncoloured brown.  They will look just the thing for our little hall, and\r\ngive it style; the heads are excellent imitations.  Poolers and Smith are\r\nsorry they have nothing to offer Lupin.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 24.\xe2\x80\x94Simply to please Lupin, and make things cheerful for him, as\r\nhe is a little down, Carrie invited Mrs. James to come up from Sutton and\r\nspend two or three days with us.  We have not said a word to Lupin, but\r\nmean to keep it as a surprise.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 25.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. James, of Sutton, arrived in the afternoon, bringing with\r\nher an enormous bunch of wild flowers.  The more I see of Mrs. James the\r\nnicer I think she is, and she is devoted to Carrie.  She went into\r\nCarrie\xe2\x80\x99s room to take off her bonnet, and remained there nearly an hour\r\ntalking about dress.  Lupin said he was not a bit surprised at Mrs.\r\nJames\xe2\x80\x99 _visit_, but was surprised at _her_.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 26, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Nearly late for church, Mrs. James having talked\r\nconsiderably about what to wear all the morning.  Lupin does not seem to\r\nget on very well with Mrs. James.  I am afraid we shall have some trouble\r\nwith our next-door neighbours who came in last Wednesday.  Several of\r\ntheir friends, who drive up in dog-carts, have already made themselves\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nAn evening or two ago I had put on a white waistcoat for coolness, and\r\nwhile walking past with my thumbs in my waistcoat pockets (a habit I\r\nhave), one man, seated in the cart, and looking like an American,\r\ncommenced singing some vulgar nonsense about \xe2\x80\x9c_I had thirteen dollars in\r\nmy waistcoat pocket_.\xe2\x80\x9d  I fancied it was meant for me, and my suspicions\r\nwere confirmed; for while walking round the garden in my tall hat this\r\nafternoon, a \xe2\x80\x9cthrow-down\xe2\x80\x9d cracker was deliberately aimed at my hat, and\r\nexploded on it like a percussion cap.  I turned sharply, and am positive\r\nI saw the man who was in the cart retreating from one of the bedroom\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 27.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie and Mrs. James went off shopping, and had not returned\r\nwhen I came back from the office.  Judging from the subsequent\r\nconversation, I am afraid Mrs. James is filling Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s head with a lot\r\nof nonsense about dress.  I walked over to Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s and asked him to drop\r\nin to supper, and make things pleasant.\r\n\r\nCarrie prepared a little extemporised supper, consisting of the remainder\r\nof the cold joint, a small piece of salmon (which I was to refuse, in\r\ncase there was not enough to go round), and a blanc-mange and custards.\r\nThere was also a decanter of port and some jam puffs on the sideboard.\r\nMrs. James made us play rather a good game of cards, called \xe2\x80\x9cMuggings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo my surprise, in fact disgust, Lupin got up in the middle, and, in a\r\nmost sarcastic tone, said: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, this sort of thing is too fast for\r\nme, I shall go and enjoy a quiet game of marbles in the back-garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThings might have become rather disagreeable but for Gowing (who seems to\r\nhave taken to Lupin) suggesting they should invent games.  Lupin said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s play \xe2\x80\x98monkeys.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  He then led Gowing all round the room, and\r\nbrought him in front of the looking-glass.  I must confess I laughed\r\nheartily at this.  I was a little vexed at everybody subsequently\r\nlaughing at some joke which they did not explain, and it was only on\r\ngoing to bed I discovered I must have been walking about all the evening\r\nwith an antimacassar on one button of my coat-tails.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 28.\xe2\x80\x94Found a large brick in the middle bed of geraniums, evidently\r\ncome from next door.  Pattles and Pattles can\xe2\x80\x99t find a place for Lupin.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 29.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. James is making a positive fool of Carrie.  Carrie\r\nappeared in a new dress like a smock-frock.  She said \xe2\x80\x9csmocking\xe2\x80\x9d was all\r\nthe rage.  I replied it put me in a rage.  She also had on a hat as big\r\nas a kitchen coal-scuttle, and the same shape.  Mrs. James went home, and\r\nboth Lupin and I were somewhat pleased\xe2\x80\x94the first time we have agreed on a\r\nsingle subject since his return.  Merkins and Son write they have no\r\nvacancy for Lupin.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 30.\xe2\x80\x94I should very much like to know who has wilfully torn the\r\nlast five or six weeks out of my diary.  It is perfectly monstrous!  Mine\r\nis a large scribbling diary, with plenty of space for the record of my\r\neveryday events, and in keeping up that record I take (with much pride) a\r\ngreat deal of pains.\r\n\r\nI asked Carrie if she knew anything about it.  She replied it was my own\r\nfault for leaving the diary about with a charwoman cleaning and the\r\nsweeps in the house.  I said that was not an answer to my question.  This\r\nretort of mine, which I thought extremely smart, would have been more\r\neffective had I not jogged my elbow against a vase on a table temporarily\r\nplaced in the passage, knocked it over, and smashed it.\r\n\r\nCarrie was dreadfully upset at this disaster, for it was one of a pair of\r\nvases which cannot be matched, given to us on our wedding-day by Mrs.\r\nBurtsett, an old friend of Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s cousins, the Pommertons, late of\r\nDalston.  I called to Sarah, and asked her about the diary.  She said she\r\nhad not been in the sitting-room at all; after the sweep had left, Mrs.\r\nBirrell (the charwoman) had cleaned the room and lighted the fire\r\nherself.  Finding a burnt piece of paper in the grate, I examined it, and\r\nfound it was a piece of my diary.  So it was evident some one had torn my\r\ndiary to light the fire.  I requested Mrs. Birrell to be sent to me\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 31.\xe2\x80\x94Received a letter from our principal, Mr. Perkupp, saying\r\nthat he thinks he knows of a place at last for our dear boy Lupin.  This,\r\nin a measure, consoles me for the loss of a portion of my diary; for I am\r\nbound to confess the last few weeks have been devoted to the record of\r\ndisappointing answers received from people to whom I have applied for\r\nappointments for Lupin.  Mrs. Birrell called, and, in reply to me, said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never _see_ no book, much less take such a liberty as _touch_ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I was determined to find out who did it, whereupon she said she\r\nwould do her best to help me; but she remembered the sweep lighting the\r\nfire with a bit of the _Echo_.  I requested the sweep to be sent to me\r\nto-morrow.  I wish Carrie had not given Lupin a latch-key; we never seem\r\nto see anything of him.  I sat up till past one for him, and then retired\r\ntired.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 1.\xe2\x80\x94My entry yesterday about \xe2\x80\x9cretired tired,\xe2\x80\x9d which I did not\r\nnotice at the time, is rather funny.  If I were not so worried just now,\r\nI might have had a little joke about it.  The sweep called, but had the\r\naudacity to come up to the hall-door and lean his dirty bag of soot on\r\nthe door-step.  He, however, was so polite, I could not rebuke him.  He\r\nsaid Sarah lighted the fire.  Unfortunately, Sarah heard this, for she\r\nwas dusting the banisters, and she ran down, and flew into a temper with\r\nthe sweep, causing a row on the front door-steps, which I would not have\r\nhad happen for anything.  I ordered her about her business, and told the\r\nsweep I was sorry to have troubled him; and so I was, for the door-steps\r\nwere covered with soot in consequence of his visit.  I would willingly\r\ngive ten shillings to find out who tore my diary.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 2.\xe2\x80\x94I spent the evening quietly with Carrie, of whose company I\r\nnever tire.  We had a most pleasant chat about the letters on \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nMarriage a Failure?\xe2\x80\x9d  It has been no failure in our case.  In talking\r\nover our own happy experiences, we never noticed that it was past\r\nmidnight.  We were startled by hearing the door slam violently.  Lupin\r\nhad come in.  He made no attempt to turn down the gas in the passage, or\r\neven to look into the room where we were, but went straight up to bed,\r\nmaking a terrible noise.  I asked him to come down for a moment, and he\r\nbegged to be excused, as he was \xe2\x80\x9cdead beat,\xe2\x80\x9d an observation that was\r\nscarcely consistent with the fact that, for a quarter of an hour\r\nafterwards, he was positively dancing in his room, and shouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cSee\r\nme dance the polka!\xe2\x80\x9d or some such nonsense.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 3.\xe2\x80\x94Good news at last.  Mr. Perkupp has got an appointment for\r\nLupin, and he is to go and see about it on Monday.  Oh, how my mind is\r\nrelieved!  I went to Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s room to take the good news to him, but he\r\nwas in bed, very seedy, so I resolved to keep it over till the evening.\r\n\r\nHe said he had last night been elected a member of an Amateur Dramatic\r\nClub, called the \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians\xe2\x80\x9d; and, though it was a pleasant\r\nevening, he had sat in a draught, and got neuralgia in the head.  He\r\ndeclined to have any breakfast, so I left him.   In the evening I had up\r\na special bottle of port, and, Lupin being in for a wonder, we filled our\r\nglasses, and I said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin my boy, I have some good and unexpected news\r\nfor you.  Mr. Perkupp has procured you an appointment!\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood biz!\xe2\x80\x9d and we drained our glasses.\r\n\r\nLupin then said: \xe2\x80\x9cFill up the glasses again, for I have some good and\r\nunexpected news for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had some slight misgivings, and so evidently had Carrie, for she said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we shall think it good news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right!  _I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged to be married_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDaisy Mutlar sole topic of conversation.  Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s new berth.  Fireworks\r\nat the Cummings\xe2\x80\x99.  The \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sarah quarrels with the\r\ncharwoman.  Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s uncalled-for interference.  Am introduced to Daisy\r\nMutlar.  We decide to give a party in her honour.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 5, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie and I troubled about that mere boy Lupin\r\ngetting engaged to be married without consulting us or anything.  After\r\ndinner he told us all about it.  He said the lady\xe2\x80\x99s name was Daisy\r\nMutlar, and she was the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he\r\never met.  He loved her the moment he saw her, and if he had to wait\r\nfifty years he would wait, and he knew she would wait for him.\r\n\r\nLupin further said, with much warmth, that the world was a different\r\nworld to him now,\xe2\x80\x94it was a world worth living in.  He lived with an\r\nobject now, and that was to make Daisy Mutlar\xe2\x80\x94Daisy Pooter, and he would\r\nguarantee she would not disgrace the family of the Pooters.  Carrie here\r\nburst out crying, and threw her arms round his neck, and in doing so,\r\nupset the glass of port he held in his hand all over his new light\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nI said I had no doubt we should like Miss Mutlar when we saw her, but\r\nCarrie said she loved her already.  I thought this rather premature, but\r\nheld my tongue.  Daisy Mutlar was the sole topic of conversation for the\r\nremainder of the day.  I asked Lupin who her people were, and he replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know Mutlar, Williams and Watts.\xe2\x80\x9d  I did not know, but refrained\r\nfrom asking any further questions at present, for fear of irritating\r\nLupin.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 6.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin went with me to the office, and had a long conversation\r\nwith Mr. Perkupp, our principal, the result of which was that he accepted\r\na clerkship in the firm of Job Cleanands and Co., Stock and Share\r\nBrokers.  Lupin told me, privately, it was an advertising firm, and he\r\ndid not think much of it.  I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBeggars should not be choosers;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand I will do Lupin the justice to say, he looked rather ashamed of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we went round to the Cummings\xe2\x80\x99, to have a few fireworks.\r\nIt began to rain, and I thought it rather dull.  One of my squibs would\r\nnot go off, and Gowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cHit it on your boot, boy; it will go off\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d  I gave it a few knocks on the end of my boot, and it went off\r\nwith one loud explosion, and burnt my fingers rather badly.  I gave the\r\nrest of the squibs to the little Cummings\xe2\x80\x99 boy to let off.\r\n\r\nAnother unfortunate thing happened, which brought a heap of abuse on my\r\nhead.  Cummings fastened a large wheel set-piece on a stake in the ground\r\nby way of a grand finale.  He made a great fuss about it; said it cost\r\nseven shillings.  There was a little difficulty in getting it alight.  At\r\nlast it went off; but after a couple of slow revolutions it stopped.  I\r\nhad my stick with me, so I gave it a tap to send it round, and,\r\nunfortunately, it fell off the stake on to the grass.  Anybody would have\r\nthought I had set the house on fire from the way in which they stormed at\r\nme.  I will never join in any more firework parties.  It is a ridiculous\r\nwaste of time and money.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 7.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin asked Carrie to call on Mrs. Mutlar, but Carrie said\r\nshe thought Mrs. Mutlar ought to call on her first.  I agreed with\r\nCarrie, and this led to an argument.  However, the matter was settled by\r\nCarrie saying she could not find any visiting cards, and we must get some\r\nmore printed, and when they were finished would be quite time enough to\r\ndiscuss the etiquette of calling.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 8.\xe2\x80\x94I ordered some of our cards at Black\xe2\x80\x99s, the stationers.  I\r\nordered twenty-five of each, which will last us for a good long time.  In\r\nthe evening, Lupin brought in Harry Mutlar, Miss Mutlar\xe2\x80\x99s brother.  He\r\nwas rather a gawky youth, and Lupin said he was the most popular and best\r\namateur in the club, referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin\r\nwhispered to us that if we could only \xe2\x80\x9cdraw out\xe2\x80\x9d Harry a bit, he would\r\nmake us roar with laughter.\r\n\r\nAt supper, young Mutlar did several amusing things.  He took up a knife,\r\nand with the flat part of it played a tune on his cheek in a wonderful\r\nmanner.  He also gave an imitation of an old man with no teeth, smoking a\r\nbig cigar.  The way he kept dropping the cigar sent Carrie into fits.\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation, Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s name cropped up, and young Mutlar\r\nsaid he would bring his sister round to us one evening\xe2\x80\x94his parents being\r\nrather old-fashioned, and not going out much.  Carrie said we would get\r\nup a little special party.  As young Mutlar showed no inclination to go,\r\nand it was approaching eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as a hint I reminded Lupin that he\r\nhad to be up early to-morrow.  Instead of taking the hint, Mutlar began a\r\nseries of comic imitations.  He went on for an hour without cessation.\r\nPoor Carrie could scarcely keep her eyes open.  At last she made an\r\nexcuse, and said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMutlar then left, and I heard him and Lupin whispering in the hall\r\nsomething about the \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians,\xe2\x80\x9d and to my disgust, although it\r\nwas past midnight, Lupin put on his hat and coat, and went out with his\r\nnew companion.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 9.\xe2\x80\x94My endeavours to discover who tore the sheets out of my diary\r\nstill fruitless.  Lupin has Daisy Mutlar on the brain, so we see little\r\nof him, except that he invariably turns up at meal times.  Cummings\r\ndropped in.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 10.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin seems to like his new berth\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort.  Daisy\r\nMutlar the sole topic of conversation during tea.  Carrie almost as full\r\nof it as Lupin.  Lupin informs me, to my disgust, that he has been\r\npersuaded to take part in the forthcoming performance of the \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway\r\nComedians.\xe2\x80\x9d  He says he is to play Bob Britches in the farce, _Gone to my\r\nUncle\xe2\x80\x99s_; Frank Mutlar is going to play old Musty.  I told Lupin pretty\r\nplainly I was not in the least degree interested in the matter, and\r\ntotally disapproved of amateur theatricals.  Gowing came in the evening.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 11.\xe2\x80\x94Returned home to find the house in a most disgraceful\r\nuproar, Carrie, who appeared very frightened, was standing outside her\r\nbedroom, while Sarah was excited and crying.  Mrs. Birrell (the\r\ncharwoman), who had evidently been drinking, was shouting at the top of\r\nher voice that she was \xe2\x80\x9cno thief, that she was a respectable woman, who\r\nhad to work hard for her living, and she would smack anyone\xe2\x80\x99s face who\r\nput lies into her mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin, whose back was towards me, did not hear\r\nme come in.  He was standing between the two women, and, I regret to say,\r\nin his endeavour to act as peacemaker, he made use of rather strong\r\nlanguage in the presence of his mother; and I was just in time to hear\r\nhim say: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all this fuss about the loss of a few pages from a rotten\r\ndiary that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fetch three-halfpence a pound!\xe2\x80\x9d  I said, quietly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Lupin, that is a matter of opinion; and as I am master of\r\nthis house, perhaps you will allow me to take the reins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ascertained that the cause of the row was, that Sarah had accused Mrs.\r\nBirrell of tearing the pages out of my diary to wrap up some kitchen fat\r\nand leavings which she had taken out of the house last week.  Mrs.\r\nBirrell had slapped Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s face, and said she had taken nothing out of\r\nthe place, as there was \xe2\x80\x9cnever no leavings to take.\xe2\x80\x9d  I ordered Sarah\r\nback to her work, and requested Mrs. Birrell to go home.  When I entered\r\nthe parlour Lupin was kicking his legs in the air, and roaring with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 12, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Coming home from church Carrie and I met Lupin,\r\nDaisy Mutlar, and her brother.  Daisy was introduced to us, and we walked\r\nhome together, Carrie walking on with Miss Mutlar.  We asked them in for\r\na few minutes, and I had a good look at my future daughter-in-law.  My\r\nheart quite sank.  She is a big young woman, and I should think at least\r\neight years older than Lupin.  I did not even think her good-looking.\r\nCarrie asked her if she could come in on Wednesday next with her brother\r\nto meet a few friends.  She replied that she would only be too pleased.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 13.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie sent out invitations to Gowing, the Cummings, to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. James (of Sutton), and Mr. Stillbrook.  I wrote a note to Mr.\r\nFranching, of Peckham.  Carrie said we may as well make it a nice affair,\r\nand why not ask our principal, Mr. Perkupp?  I said I feared we were not\r\nquite grand enough for him.  Carrie said there was \xe2\x80\x9cno offence in asking\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d and I wrote him a letter.  Carrie\r\nconfessed she was a little disappointed with Daisy Mutlar\xe2\x80\x99s appearance,\r\nbut thought she seemed a nice girl.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 14.\xe2\x80\x94Everybody so far has accepted for our quite grand little\r\nparty for to-morrow.  Mr. Perkupp, in a nice letter which I shall keep,\r\nwrote that he was dining in Kensington, but if he could get away, he\r\nwould come up to Holloway for an hour.  Carrie was busy all day, making\r\nlittle cakes and open jam puffs and jellies.  She said she felt quite\r\nnervous about her responsibilities to-morrow evening.  We decided to have\r\nsome light things on the table, such as sandwiches, cold chicken and ham,\r\nand some sweets, and on the sideboard a nice piece of cold beef and a\r\nPaysandu tongue\xe2\x80\x94for the more hungry ones to peg into if they liked.\r\n\r\nGowing called to know if he was to put on \xe2\x80\x9cswallow-tails\xe2\x80\x9d to-morrow.\r\nCarrie said he had better dress, especially as Mr. Franching was coming,\r\nand there was a possibility of Mr. Perkupp also putting in an appearance.\r\n\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I only wanted to know, for I have not worn my\r\ndress-coat for some time, and I must send it to have the creases pressed\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter Gowing left, Lupin came in, and in his anxiety to please Daisy\r\nMutlar, carped at and criticised the arrangements, and, in fact,\r\ndisapproved of everything, including our having asked our old friend\r\nCummings, who, he said, would look in evening-dress like a green-grocer\r\nengaged to wait, and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one.\r\n\r\nI fairly lost my temper, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin, allow me to tell you Miss\r\nDaisy Mutlar is not the Queen of England.  I gave you credit for more\r\nwisdom than to allow yourself to be inveigled into an engagement with a\r\nwoman considerably older than yourself.  I advise you to think of earning\r\nyour living before entangling yourself with a wife whom you will have to\r\nsupport, and, in all probability, her brother also, who appeared to be\r\nnothing but a loafer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of receiving this advice in a sensible manner, Lupin jumped up\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you insult the lady I am engaged to, you insult me.  I will\r\nleave the house and never darken your doors again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out of the house, slamming the hall-door.  But it was all right.\r\nHe came back to supper, and we played B\xc3\xa9zique till nearly twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first important Party.  Old Friends and New Friends.  Gowing is a\r\nlittle annoying; but his friend, Mr. Stillbrook, turns out to be quite\r\namusing.  Inopportune arrival of Mr. Perkupp, but he is most kind and\r\ncomplimentary.  Party a great success.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 15.\xe2\x80\x94A red-letter day.  Our first important party since we have\r\nbeen in this house.  I got home early from the City.  Lupin insisted on\r\nhaving a hired waiter, and stood a half-dozen of champagne.  I think this\r\nan unnecessary expense, but Lupin said he had had a piece of luck, having\r\nmade three pounds out a private deal in the City.  I hope he won\xe2\x80\x99t gamble\r\nin his new situation.  The supper-room looked so nice, and Carrie truly\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWe need not be ashamed of its being seen by Mr. Perkupp, should he\r\nhonour us by coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dressed early in case people should arrive punctually at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nand was much vexed to find my new dress-trousers much too short.\r\n\r\nLupin, who is getting beyond his position, found fault with my wearing\r\nordinary boots instead of dress-boots.\r\n\r\nI replied satirically: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear son, I have lived to be above that sort\r\nof thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin burst out laughing, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cA man generally was above his\r\nboots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis may be funny, or it may _not_; but I was gratified to find he had\r\nnot discovered the coral had come off one of my studs.  Carrie looked a\r\npicture, wearing the dress she wore at the Mansion House.  The\r\narrangement of the drawing-room was excellent.  Carrie had hung muslin\r\ncurtains over the folding-doors, and also over one of the entrances, for\r\nwe had removed the door from its hinges.\r\n\r\nMr. Peters, the waiter, arrived in good time, and I gave him strict\r\norders not to open another bottle of champagne until the previous one was\r\nempty.  Carrie arranged for some sherry and port wine to be placed on the\r\ndrawing-room sideboard, with some glasses.  By-the-by, our new enlarged\r\nand tinted photographs look very nice on the walls, especially as Carrie\r\nhas arranged some Liberty silk bows on the four corners of them.\r\n\r\nThe first arrival was Gowing, who, with his usual taste, greeted me with:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloh, Pooter, why your trousers are too short!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI simply said: \xe2\x80\x9cVery likely, and you will find my temper \xe2\x80\x98_short_\xe2\x80\x99 also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t make your trousers longer, Juggins.  You should get\r\nyour missus to put a flounce on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wonder I waste my time entering his insulting observations in my diary.\r\n\r\nThe next arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Cummings.  The former said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about dress, I have come \xe2\x80\x98half dress.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  He had on a\r\nblack frock-coat and white tie.  The James\xe2\x80\x99, Mr. Merton, and Mr.\r\nStillbrook arrived, but Lupin was restless and unbearable till his Daisy\r\nMutlar and Frank arrived.\r\n\r\nCarrie and I were rather startled at Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.  She had a\r\nbright-crimson dress on, cut very low in the neck.  I do not think such a\r\nstyle modest.  She ought to have taken a lesson from Carrie, and covered\r\nher shoulders with a little lace.  Mr. Nackles, Mr. Sprice-Hogg and his\r\nfour daughters came; so did Franching, and one or two of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\nfriends, members of the \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians.\xe2\x80\x9d  Some of these seemed\r\nrather theatrical in their manner, especially one, who was posing all the\r\nevening, and leant on our little round table and cracked it.  Lupin\r\ncalled him \xe2\x80\x9cour Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d and said he was \xe2\x80\x9cour lead at the H.C.\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d and was\r\nquite as good in that department as Harry Mutlar was as the low-comedy\r\nmerchant.  All this is Greek to me.\r\n\r\nWe had some music, and Lupin, who never left Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s side for a moment,\r\nraved over her singing of a song, called \xe2\x80\x9cSome Day.\xe2\x80\x9d  It seemed a pretty\r\nsong, but she made such grimaces, and sang, to my mind, so out of tune, I\r\nwould not have asked her to sing again; but Lupin made her sing four\r\nsongs right off, one after the other.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock we went down to supper, and from the way Gowing and\r\nCummings ate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month.\r\nI told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr. Perkupp should come by\r\nmere chance.  Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of\r\nchampagne, and drinking it straight off.  He repeated this action, and\r\nmade me fear our half-dozen of champagne would not last out.  I tried to\r\nkeep a bottle back, but Lupin got hold of it, and took it to the\r\nside-table with Daisy and Frank Mutlar.\r\n\r\nWe went upstairs, and the young fellows began skylarking.  Carrie put a\r\nstop to that at once.  Stillbrook amused us with a song, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you\r\ndone with your Cousin John?\xe2\x80\x9d  I did not notice that Lupin and Frank had\r\ndisappeared.  I asked Mr. Watson, one of the Holloways, where they were,\r\nand he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a case of \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what a surprise!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were directed to form a circle\xe2\x80\x94which we did.  Watson then said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave much pleasure in introducing the celebrated Blondin Donkey.\xe2\x80\x9d  Frank\r\nand Lupin then bounded into the room.  Lupin had whitened his face like a\r\nclown, and Frank had tied round his waist a large hearthrug.  He was\r\nsupposed to be the donkey, and he looked it.  They indulged in a very\r\nnoisy pantomime, and we were all shrieking with laughter.\r\n\r\nI turned round suddenly, and then I saw Mr. Perkupp standing half-way in\r\nthe door, he having arrived without our knowing it.  I beckoned to\r\nCarrie, and we went up to him at once.  He would not come right into the\r\nroom.  I apologised for the foolery, but Mr. Perkupp said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it seems\r\namusing.\xe2\x80\x9d  I could see he was not a bit amused.\r\n\r\nCarrie and I took him downstairs, but the table was a wreck.  There was\r\nnot a glass of champagne left\xe2\x80\x94not even a sandwich.  Mr. Perkupp said he\r\nrequired nothing, but would like a glass of seltzer or soda water.  The\r\nlast syphon was empty.  Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have plenty of port wine left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Perkupp said, with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you.  I really require\r\nnothing, but I am most pleased to see you and your husband in your own\r\nhome.  Good-night, Mrs. Pooter\xe2\x80\x94you will excuse my very short stay, I\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d  I went with him to his carriage, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble to\r\ncome to the office till twelve to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt despondent as I went back to the house, and I told Carrie I\r\nthought the party was a failure.  Carrie said it was a great success, and\r\nI was only tired, and insisted on my having some port myself.  I drank\r\ntwo glasses, and felt much better, and we went into the drawing-room,\r\nwhere they had commenced dancing.  Carrie and I had a little dance, which\r\nI said reminded me of old days.  She said I was a spooney old thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nReflections.  I make another Good Joke.  Am annoyed at the constant\r\nserving-up of the \xe2\x80\x9cBlanc-Mange.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin expresses his opinion of\r\nWeddings.  Lupin falls out with Daisy Mutlar.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 16.\xe2\x80\x94Woke about twenty times during the night, with terrible\r\nthirst.  Finished off all the water in the bottle, as well as half that\r\nin the jug.  Kept dreaming also, that last night\xe2\x80\x99s party was a failure,\r\nand that a lot of low people came without invitation, and kept chaffing\r\nand throwing things at Mr. Perkupp, till at last I was obliged to hide\r\nhim in the box-room (which we had just discovered), with a bath-towel\r\nover him.  It seems absurd now, but it was painfully real in the dream.\r\nI had the same dream about a dozen times.\r\n\r\nCarrie annoyed me by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know champagne never agrees with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI told her I had only a couple of glasses of it, having kept myself\r\nentirely to port.  I added that good champagne hurt nobody, and Lupin\r\ntold me he had only got it from a traveller as a favour, as that\r\nparticular brand had been entirely bought up by a West-End club.\r\n\r\nI think I ate too heartily of the \xe2\x80\x9cside dishes,\xe2\x80\x9d as the waiter called\r\nthem.  I said to Carrie: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had put those \xe2\x80\x98side dishes\xe2\x80\x99 _aside_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI repeated this, but Carrie was busy, packing up the teaspoons we had\r\nborrowed of Mrs. Cummings for the party.  It was just half-past eleven,\r\nand I was starting for the office, when Lupin appeared, with a yellow\r\ncomplexion, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cHulloh! Guv., what priced head have you this\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d  I told him he might just as well speak to me in Dutch.  He\r\nadded: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I woke this morning, my head was as big as Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nballoon.\xe2\x80\x9d  On the spur of the moment I said the cleverest thing I think I\r\nhave ever said; viz.: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that accounts for the para_shooting_\r\npains.\xe2\x80\x9d  We roared.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 17.\xe2\x80\x94Still feel tired and headachy!  In the evening Gowing\r\ncalled, and was full of praise about our party last Wednesday.  He said\r\neverything was done beautifully, and he enjoyed himself enormously.\r\nGowing can be a very nice fellow when he likes, but you never know how\r\nlong it will last.  For instance, he stopped to supper, and seeing some\r\n_blanc-mange_ on the table, shouted out, while the servant was in the\r\nroom: \xe2\x80\x9cHulloh!  The remains of Wednesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 18.\xe2\x80\x94Woke up quite fresh after a good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, and feel\r\nquite myself again.  I am satisfied a life of going-out and Society is\r\nnot a life for me; we therefore declined the invitation which we received\r\nthis morning to Miss Bird\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.  We only met her twice at Mrs.\r\nJames\xe2\x80\x99, and it means a present.  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am with you for once.  To\r\nmy mind a wedding\xe2\x80\x99s a very poor play.  There are only two parts in it\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbride and bridegroom.  The best man is only a walking gentleman.  With\r\nthe exception of a crying father and a snivelling mother, the rest are\r\n_supers_ who have to dress well and have to _pay_ for their insignificant\r\nparts in the shape of costly presents.\xe2\x80\x9d  I did not care for the\r\ntheatrical slang, but thought it clever, though disrespectful.\r\n\r\nI told Sarah not to bring up the _blanc-mange_ again for breakfast.  It\r\nseems to have been placed on our table at every meal since Wednesday.\r\nCummings came round in the evening, and congratulated us on the success\r\nof our party.  He said it was the best party he had been to for many a\r\nyear; but he wished we had let him know it was full dress, as he would\r\nhave turned up in his swallow-tails.  We sat down to a quiet game of\r\ndominoes, and were interrupted by the noisy entrance of Lupin and Frank\r\nMutlar.  Cummings and I asked them to join us.  Lupin said he did not\r\ncare for dominoes, and suggested a game of \xe2\x80\x9cSpoof.\xe2\x80\x9d  On my asking if it\r\nrequired counters, Frank and Lupin in measured time said: \xe2\x80\x9cOne, two,\r\nthree; go!  Have you an estate in Greenland?\xe2\x80\x9d  It was simply Greek to me,\r\nbut it appears it is one of the customs of the \xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians\xe2\x80\x9d to do\r\nthis when a member displays ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my instructions, that _blanc-mange_ was brought up again for\r\nsupper.  To make matters worse, there had been an attempt to disguise it,\r\nby placing it in a glass dish with jam round it.  Carrie asked Lupin if\r\nhe would have some, and he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo second-hand goods for me, thank\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d  I told Carrie, when we were alone, if that _blanc-mange_ were\r\nplaced on the table again I should walk out of the house.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 19, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94A delightfully quiet day.  In the afternoon Lupin\r\nwas off to spend the rest of the day with the Mutlars.  He departed in\r\nthe best of spirits, and Carrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, one advantage of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nengagement with Daisy is that the boy seems happy all day long.  That\r\nquite reconciles me to what I must confess seems an imprudent\r\nengagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie and I talked the matter over during the evening, and agreed that\r\nit did not always follow that an early engagement meant an unhappy\r\nmarriage.  Dear Carrie reminded me that we married early, and, with the\r\nexception of a few trivial misunderstandings, we had never had a really\r\nserious word.  I could not help thinking (as I told her) that half the\r\npleasures of life were derived from the little struggles and small\r\nprivations that one had to endure at the beginning of one\xe2\x80\x99s married life.\r\nSuch struggles were generally occasioned by want of means, and often\r\nhelped to make loving couples stand together all the firmer.\r\n\r\nCarrie said I had expressed myself wonderfully well, and that I was quite\r\na philosopher.\r\n\r\nWe are all vain at times, and I must confess I felt flattered by Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle compliment.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be able to express myself in fine\r\nlanguage, but I feel I have the power of expressing my thoughts with\r\nsimplicity and lucidness.  About nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, to our surprise, Lupin\r\nentered, with a wild, reckless look, and in a hollow voice, which I must\r\nsay seemed rather theatrical, said: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any brandy?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo;\r\nbut here is some whisky.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin drank off nearly a wineglassful without\r\nwater, to my horror.\r\n\r\nWe all three sat reading in silence till ten, when Carrie and I rose to\r\ngo to bed.  Carrie said to Lupin: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope Daisy is well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin, with a forced careless air that he must have picked up from the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians,\xe2\x80\x9d replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Daisy?  You mean Miss Mutlar.  I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know whether she is well or not, but please _never to mention her\r\nname again in my presence_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a dose of Irving imitations.  Make the acquaintance of a Mr.\r\nPadge.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him.  Mr. Burwin-Fosselton becomes a nuisance.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 20.\xe2\x80\x94Have seen nothing of Lupin the whole day.  Bought a cheap\r\naddress-book.  I spent the evening copying in the names and addresses of\r\nmy friends and acquaintances.  Left out the Mutlars of course.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 21.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin turned up for a few minutes in the evening.  He asked\r\nfor a drop of brandy with a sort of careless look, which to my mind was\r\ntheatrical and quite ineffective.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, I have none, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I should give it you if I had.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go where I\r\ncan get some,\xe2\x80\x9d and walked out of the house.  Carrie took the boy\xe2\x80\x99s part,\r\nand the rest of the evening was spent in a disagreeable discussion, in\r\nwhich the words \xe2\x80\x9cDaisy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMutlar\xe2\x80\x9d must have occurred a thousand times.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 22.\xe2\x80\x94Gowing and Cummings dropped in during the evening.  Lupin\r\nalso came in, bringing his friend, Mr. Burwin-Fosselton\xe2\x80\x94one of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolloway Comedians\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94who was at our party the other night, and who\r\ncracked our little round table.  Happy to say Daisy Mutlar was never\r\nreferred to.  The conversation was almost entirely monopolised by the\r\nyoung fellow Fosselton, who not only looked rather like Mr. Irving, but\r\nseemed to imagine that he _was_ the celebrated actor.  I must say he gave\r\nsome capital imitations of him.  As he showed no signs of moving at\r\nsupper time, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you like to stay, Mr. Fosselton, for our usual\r\ncrust\xe2\x80\x94pray do.\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! thanks; but please call me\r\nBurwin-Fosselton.  It is a double name.  There are lots of Fosseltons,\r\nbut please call me Burwin-Fosselton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began doing the Irving business all through supper.  He sank so low\r\ndown in his chair that his chin was almost on a level with the table, and\r\ntwice he kicked Carrie under the table, upset his wine, and flashed a\r\nknife uncomfortably near Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s face.  After supper he kept stretching\r\nout his legs on the fender, indulging in scraps of quotations from plays\r\nwhich were Greek to me, and more than once knocked over the fire-irons,\r\nmaking a hideous row\xe2\x80\x94poor Carrie already having a bad headache.\r\n\r\nWhen he went, he said, to our surprise: \xe2\x80\x9cI will come to-morrow and bring\r\nmy Irving make-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it\r\nand would come too.  I could not help thinking they might as well give a\r\nparty at my house while they are about it.  However, as Carrie sensibly\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cDo anything, dear, to make Lupin forget the Daisy Mutlar\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 23.\xe2\x80\x94In the evening, Cummings came early.  Gowing came a little\r\nlater and brought, without asking permission, a fat and, I think, very\r\nvulgar-looking man named Padge, who appeared to be all moustache.  Gowing\r\nnever attempted any apology to either of us, but said Padge wanted to see\r\nthe Irving business, to which Padge said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d and that is\r\nabout all he _did_ say during the entire evening.  Lupin came in and\r\nseemed in much better spirits.  He had prepared a bit of a surprise.  Mr.\r\nBurwin-Fosselton had come in with him, but had gone upstairs to get\r\nready.  In half-an-hour Lupin retired from the parlour, and returning in\r\na few minutes, announced \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henry Irving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI must say we were all astounded.  I never saw such a resemblance.  It\r\nwas astonishing.  The only person who did not appear interested was the\r\nman Padge, who had got the best arm-chair, and was puffing away at a foul\r\npipe into the fireplace.  After some little time I said; \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do actors\r\nalways wear their hair so long?\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie in a moment said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hare\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t wear long _hair_.\xe2\x80\x9d  How we laughed except Mr. Fosselton, who\r\nsaid, in a rather patronising kind of way, \xe2\x80\x9cThe joke, Mrs. Pooter, is\r\nextremely appropriate, if not altogether new.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thinking this rather a\r\nsnub, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fosselton, I fancy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  He interrupted me by saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. _Burwin_-Fosselton, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d which made me quite forget what\r\nI was going to say to him.  During the supper Mr. Burwin-Fosselton again\r\nmonopolised the conversation with his Irving talk, and both Carrie and I\r\ncame to the conclusion one can have even too much imitation of Irving.\r\nAfter supper, Mr. Burwin-Fosselton got a little too boisterous over his\r\nIrving imitation, and suddenly seizing Gowing by the collar of his coat,\r\ndug his thumb-nail, accidentally of course, into Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s neck and took a\r\npiece of flesh out.  Gowing was rightly annoyed, but that man Padge, who\r\nhaving declined our modest supper in order that he should not lose his\r\ncomfortable chair, burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter at the\r\nlittle misadventure.  I was so annoyed at the conduct of Padge, I said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you would have laughed if he had poked Mr. Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s eye out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto which Padge replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d and laughed more than ever.  I\r\nthink perhaps the greatest surprise was when we broke up, for Mr.\r\nBurwin-Fosselton said: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mr. Pooter.  I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you like the\r\nimitation, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring _the other make-up to-morrow night_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 24.\xe2\x80\x94I went to town without a pocket-handkerchief.  This is the\r\nsecond time I have done this during the last week.  I must be losing my\r\nmemory.  Had it not been for this Daisy Mutlar business, I would have\r\nwritten to Mr. Burwin-Fosselton and told him I should be out this\r\nevening, but I fancy he is the sort of young man who would come all the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nDear old Cummings came in the evening; but Gowing sent round a little\r\nnote saying he hoped I would excuse his not turning up, which rather\r\namused me.  He added that his neck was still painful.  Of course,\r\nBurwin-Fosselton came, but Lupin never turned up, and imagine my utter\r\ndisgust when that man Padge actually came again, and not even accompanied\r\nby Gowing.  I was exasperated, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Padge, this is a\r\n_surprise_.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dear Carrie, fearing unpleasantness, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I suppose\r\nMr. Padge has only come to see the other Irving make-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Padge\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d and took the best chair again, from which he never\r\nmoved the whole evening.\r\n\r\nMy only consolation is, he takes no supper, so he is not an expensive\r\nguest, but I shall speak to Gowing about the matter.  The Irving\r\nimitations and conversations occupied the whole evening, till I was sick\r\nof it.  Once we had a rather heated discussion, which was commenced by\r\nCummings saying that it appeared to him that Mr. Burwin-Fosselton was not\r\nonly _like_ Mr. Irving, but was in his judgment every way as _good_ or\r\neven _better_.  I ventured to remark that after all it was but an\r\nimitation of an original.\r\n\r\nCummings said surely some imitations were better than the originals.  I\r\nmade what I considered a very clever remark: \xe2\x80\x9cWithout an original there\r\ncan be no imitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Burwin-Fosselton said quite impertinently:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t discuss me in my presence, if you please; and, Mr. Pooter, I\r\nshould advise you to talk about what you understand;\xe2\x80\x9d to which that cad\r\nPadge replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dear Carrie saved the whole thing by\r\nsuddenly saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be Ellen Terry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dear Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s imitation wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nbit liked, but she was so spontaneous and so funny that the disagreeable\r\ndiscussion passed off.  When they left, I very pointedly said to Mr.\r\nBurwin-Fosselton and Mr. Padge that we should be engaged to-morrow\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 25.\xe2\x80\x94Had a long letter from Mr. Fosselton respecting last night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nIrving discussion.  I was very angry, and I wrote and said I knew little\r\nor nothing about stage matters, was not in the least interested in them\r\nand positively declined to be drawn into a discussion on the subject,\r\neven at the risk of its leading to a breach of friendship.  I never wrote\r\na more determined letter.\r\n\r\nOn returning home at the usual hour on Saturday afternoon I met near the\r\nArchway Daisy Mutlar.  My heart gave a leap.  I bowed rather stiffly, but\r\nshe affected not to have seen me.  Very much annoyed in the evening by\r\nthe laundress sending home an odd sock.  Sarah said she sent two pairs,\r\nand the laundress declared only a pair and a half were sent.  I spoke to\r\nCarrie about it, but she rather testily replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI am tired of speaking\r\nto her; you had better go and speak to her yourself.  She is outside.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\ndid so, but the laundress declared that only an odd sock was sent.\r\n\r\nGowing passed into the passage at this time and was rude enough to listen\r\nto the conversation, and interrupting, said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste the odd sock,\r\nold man; do an act of charity and give it to some poor man with only one\r\nleg.\xe2\x80\x9d  The laundress giggled like an idiot.  I was disgusted and walked\r\nupstairs for the purpose of pinning down my collar, as the button had\r\ncome off the back of my shirt.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the parlour, Gowing was retailing his idiotic joke\r\nabout the odd sock, and Carrie was roaring with laughter.  I suppose I am\r\nlosing my sense of humour.  I spoke my mind pretty freely about Padge.\r\nGowing said he had met him only once before that evening.  He had been\r\nintroduced by a friend, and as he (Padge) had \xe2\x80\x9cstood\xe2\x80\x9d a good dinner,\r\nGowing wished to show him some little return.  Upon my word, Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoolness surpasses all belief.  Lupin came in before I could reply, and\r\nGowing unfortunately inquired after Daisy Mutlar.  Lupin shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cMind\r\nyour own business, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d and bounced out of the room, slamming the door.\r\nThe remainder of the night was Daisy Mutlar\xe2\x80\x94Daisy Mutlar\xe2\x80\x94Daisy Mutlar.\r\nOh dear!\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 26, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94The curate preached a very good sermon to-day\xe2\x80\x94very\r\ngood indeed.  His appearance is never so impressive as our dear old\r\nvicar\xe2\x80\x99s, but I am bound to say his sermons are much more impressive.  A\r\nrather annoying incident occurred, of which I must make mention.  Mrs.\r\nFernlosse, who is quite a grand lady, living in one of those large houses\r\nin the Camden Road, stopped to speak to me after church, when we were all\r\ncoming out.  I must say I felt flattered, for she is thought a good deal\r\nof.  I suppose she knew me through seeing me so often take round the\r\nplate, especially as she always occupies the corner seat of the pew.  She\r\nis a very influential lady, and may have had something of the utmost\r\nimportance to say, but unfortunately, as she commenced to speak a strong\r\ngust of wind came and blew my hat off into the middle of the road.\r\n\r\nI had to run after it, and had the greatest difficulty in recovering it.\r\nWhen I had succeeded in doing so, I found Mrs. Fernlosse had walked on\r\nwith some swell friends, and I felt I could not well approach her now,\r\nespecially as my hat was smothered with mud.  I cannot say how\r\ndisappointed I felt.\r\n\r\nIn the evening (_Sunday_ evening of all others) I found an impertinent\r\nnote from Mr. Burwin-Fosselton, which ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. POOTER,\xe2\x80\x94Although your junior by perhaps some twenty or\r\n    thirty years\xe2\x80\x94which is sufficient reason that you ought to have a\r\n    longer record of the things and ways in this miniature of a planet\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n    feel it is just within the bounds of possibility that the wheels of\r\n    your life don\xe2\x80\x99t travel so quickly round as those of the humble writer\r\n    of these lines.  The dandy horse of past days has been known to\r\n    overtake the _slow coach_.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDo I make myself understood?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then!  Permit me, Mr. Pooter, to advise you to accept the\r\n    _verb. sap_.  Acknowledge your defeat, and take your whipping\r\n    gracefully; for remember you threw down the glove, and I cannot claim\r\n    to be either mentally or physically a _coward_!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_Revenons \xc3\xa0 nos moutons_.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOur lives run in different grooves.  I live for MY ART\xe2\x80\x94THE STAGE.\r\n    Your life is devoted to commercial pursuits\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98A life among Ledgers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    My books are of different metal.  Your life in the City is\r\n    honourable, I admit.  _But how different_!  Cannot even you see the\r\n    ocean between us?  A channel that prevents the meeting of our brains\r\n    in harmonious accord.  Ah!  But _cha\xc3\xa7un \xc3\xa0 son go\xc3\xbbt_.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI have registered a vow to mount the steps of fame.  I may crawl, I\r\n    may slip, I may even falter (we are all weak), but _reach the top\r\n    rung of the ladder I will_!!!  When there, my voice shall be heard,\r\n    for I will shout to the multitudes below: \xe2\x80\x98_Vici_!\xe2\x80\x99  For the present\r\n    I am only an amateur, and my work is unknown, forsooth, save to a\r\n    party of friends, with here and there an enemy.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Pooter, let me ask you, \xe2\x80\x98What is the difference between the\r\n    amateur and the professional?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNone!!!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cStay!  Yes, there is a difference.  One is _paid_ for doing what the\r\n    other does as skilfully for _nothing_!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will be _paid_, too!  For _I_, contrary to the wishes of my\r\n    family and friends, have at last elected to adopt the stage as _my_\r\n    profession.  And when the _farce_ craze is over\xe2\x80\x94and, _mark you_,\r\n    _that will be soon_\xe2\x80\x94I will make my power known; for I feel\xe2\x80\x94pardon my\r\n    apparent conceit\xe2\x80\x94that there is no living man who can play the\r\n    hump-backed Richard as I _feel_ and _know_ I can.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd _you_ will be the first to come round and bend your head in\r\n    submission.  There are many matters you may understand, but knowledge\r\n    of the fine art of acting is to you an _unknown quantity_.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPray let this discussion cease with this letter.  _Vale_!\r\n\r\n                                                              Yours truly,\r\n                                                       \xe2\x80\x9cBURWIN-FOSSELTON.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was disgusted.  When Lupin came in, I handed him this impertinent\r\nletter, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, in that letter you can see the true character\r\nof your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin, to my surprise, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes.  He showed me the letter before he\r\nsent it.  I think he is right, and you ought to apologise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nA serious discussion concerning the use and value of my diary.  Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion of \xe2\x80\x99Xmas.  Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate engagement is on again.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 17.\xe2\x80\x94As I open my scribbling diary I find the words \xe2\x80\x9cOxford\r\nMichaelmas Term ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  Why this should induce me to indulge in\r\nretrospective I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but it does.  The last few weeks of my diary\r\nare of minimum interest.  The breaking off of the engagement between\r\nLupin and Daisy Mutlar has made him a different being, and Carrie a\r\nrather depressing companion.  She was a little dull last Saturday, and I\r\nthought to cheer her up by reading some extracts from my diary; but she\r\nwalked out of the room in the middle of the reading, without a word.  On\r\nher return, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cDid my diary bore you, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied, to my surprise: \xe2\x80\x9cI really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t listening, dear.  I was\r\nobliged to leave to give instructions to the laundress.  In consequence\r\nof some stuff she puts in the water, two more of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s coloured shirts\r\nhave run and he says he won\xe2\x80\x99t wear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is Lupin.  It\xe2\x80\x99s all Lupin, Lupin, Lupin.  There was\r\nnot a single button on my shirt yesterday, but _I_ made no complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie simply replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou should do as all other men do, and wear\r\nstuds.  In fact, I never saw anyone but you wear buttons on the\r\nshirt-fronts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly wore none yesterday, for there were none on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the\r\nevening, and Cummings never does.  I fear they don\xe2\x80\x99t get on well with\r\nLupin.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 18.\xe2\x80\x94Yesterday I was in a retrospective vein\xe2\x80\x94to-day it is\r\n_prospective_.  I see nothing but clouds, clouds, clouds.  Lupin is\r\nperfectly intolerable over the Daisy Mutlar business.  He won\xe2\x80\x99t say what\r\nis the cause of the breach.  He is evidently condemning her conduct, and\r\nyet, if we venture to agree with him, says he won\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word against\r\nher.  So what is one to do?  Another thing which is disappointing to me\r\nis, that Carrie and Lupin take no interest whatever in my diary.\r\n\r\nI broached the subject at the breakfast-table to-day.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was in\r\nhopes that, if anything ever happened to me, the diary would be an\r\nendless source of pleasure to you both; to say nothing of the chance of\r\nthe remuneration which may accrue from its being published.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth Carrie and Lupin burst out laughing.  Carrie was sorry for this, I\r\ncould see, for she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI did not mean to be rude, dear Charlie; but\r\ntruly I do not think your diary would sufficiently interest the public to\r\nbe taken up by a publisher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure it would prove quite as interesting as some of the\r\nridiculous reminiscences that have been published lately.  Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe diary that makes the man.  Where would Evelyn and Pepys have been if\r\nit had not been for their diaries?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie said I was quite a philosopher; but Lupin, in a jeering tone,\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been written on larger paper, Guv., we might get a fair\r\nprice from a butterman for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I am in the prospective vein, I vow the end of this year will see the\r\nend of my diary.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 19.\xe2\x80\x94The annual invitation came to spend Christmas with Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94the usual family festive gathering to which we always look\r\nforward.  Lupin declined to go.  I was astounded, and expressed my\r\nsurprise and disgust.  Lupin then obliged us with the following Radical\r\nspeech: \xe2\x80\x9cI hate a family gathering at Christmas.  What does it mean?  Why\r\nsomeone says: \xe2\x80\x98Ah! we miss poor Uncle James, who was here last year,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwe all begin to snivel.  Someone else says: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s two years since poor\r\nAunt Liz used to sit in that corner.\xe2\x80\x99  Then we all begin to snivel again.\r\nThen another gloomy relation says \xe2\x80\x98Ah!  I wonder whose turn it will be\r\nnext?\xe2\x80\x99  Then we all snivel again, and proceed to eat and drink too much;\r\nand they don\xe2\x80\x99t discover until _I_ get up that we have been seated\r\nthirteen at dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 20.\xe2\x80\x94Went to Smirksons\xe2\x80\x99, the drapers, in the Strand, who this\r\nyear have turned out everything in the shop and devoted the whole place\r\nto the sale of Christmas cards.  Shop crowded with people, who seemed to\r\ntake up the cards rather roughly, and, after a hurried glance at them,\r\nthrow them down again.  I remarked to one of the young persons serving,\r\nthat carelessness appeared to be a disease with some purchasers.  The\r\nobservation was scarcely out of my mouth, when my thick coat-sleeve\r\ncaught against a large pile of expensive cards in boxes one on top of the\r\nother, and threw them down.  The manager came forward, looking very much\r\nannoyed, and picking up several cards from the ground, said to one of the\r\nassistants, with a palpable side-glance at me: \xe2\x80\x9cPut these amongst the\r\nsixpenny goods; they can\xe2\x80\x99t be sold for a shilling now.\xe2\x80\x9d  The result was,\r\nI felt it my duty to buy some of these damaged cards.\r\n\r\nI had to buy more and pay more than intended.  Unfortunately I did not\r\nexamine them all, and when I got home I discovered a vulgar card with a\r\npicture of a fat nurse with two babies, one black and the other white,\r\nand the words: \xe2\x80\x9cWe wish Pa a Merry Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d  I tore up the card and\r\nthrew it away.  Carrie said the great disadvantage of going out in\r\nSociety and increasing the number of our friends was, that we should have\r\nto send out nearly two dozen cards this year.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 21.\xe2\x80\x94To save the postman a miserable Christmas, we follow the\r\nexample of all unselfish people, and send out our cards early.  Most of\r\nthe cards had finger-marks, which I did not notice at night.  I shall buy\r\nall future cards in the daytime.  Lupin (who, ever since he has had the\r\nappointment with a stock and share broker, does not seem over-scrupulous\r\nin his dealings) told me never to rub out the pencilled price on the\r\nbacks of the cards.  I asked him why.  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose your card is\r\nmarked 9d.  Well, all you have to do is to pencil a 3\xe2\x80\x94and a long\r\ndown-stroke after it\xe2\x80\x94in _front_ of the ninepence, and people will think\r\nyou have given five times the price for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening Lupin was very low-spirited, and I reminded him that\r\nbehind the clouds the sun was shining.  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cUgh! it never shines on\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cStop, Lupin, my boy; you are worried about Daisy Mutlar.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t think of her any more.  You ought to congratulate yourself on\r\nhaving got off a very bad bargain.  Her notions are far too grand for our\r\nsimple tastes.\xe2\x80\x9d  He jumped up and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t allow one word to be\r\nuttered against her.  She\xe2\x80\x99s worth the whole bunch of your friends put\r\ntogether, that inflated, sloping-head of a Perkupp included.\xe2\x80\x9d  I left the\r\nroom with silent dignity, but caught my foot in the mat.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23.\xe2\x80\x94I exchanged no words with Lupin in the morning; but as he\r\nseemed to be in exuberant spirits in the evening, I ventured to ask him\r\nwhere he intended to spend his Christmas.  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, most likely\r\nat the Mutlars\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn wonderment, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! after your engagement has been broken off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cWho said it is off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have given us both to understand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe interrupted me by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind what I said.  _It is on\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94there_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI receive an insulting Christmas card.  We spend a pleasant Christmas at\r\nCarrie\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s.  A Mr. Moss is rather too free.  A boisterous evening,\r\nduring which I am struck in the dark.  I receive an extraordinary letter\r\nfrom Mr. Mutlar, senior, respecting Lupin.  We miss drinking out the Old\r\nYear.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 24.\xe2\x80\x94I am a poor man, but I would gladly give ten shillings to\r\nfind out who sent me the insulting Christmas card I received this\r\nmorning.  I never insult people; why should they insult me?  The worst\r\npart of the transaction is, that I find myself suspecting all my friends.\r\nThe handwriting on the envelope is evidently disguised, being written\r\nsloping the wrong way.  I cannot think either Gowing or Cummings would do\r\nsuch a mean thing.  Lupin denied all knowledge of it, and I believe him;\r\nalthough I disapprove of his laughing and sympathising with the offender.\r\nMr. Franching would be above such an act; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of the\r\nMutlars would descend to such a course.  I wonder if Pitt, that impudent\r\nclerk at the office, did it?  Or Mrs. Birrell, the charwoman, or\r\nBurwin-Fosselton?  The writing is too good for the former.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DAY.\xe2\x80\x94We caught the 10.20 train at Paddington, and spent a\r\npleasant day at Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s.  The country was quite nice and\r\npleasant, although the roads were sloppy.  We dined in the middle of the\r\nday, just ten of us, and talked over old times.  If everybody had a nice,\r\n_un_interfering mother-in-law, such as I have, what a deal of happiness\r\nthere would be in the world.  Being all in good spirits, I proposed her\r\nhealth, and I made, I think, a very good speech.\r\n\r\nI concluded, rather neatly, by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cOn an occasion like this\xe2\x80\x94whether\r\nrelatives, friends, or acquaintances,\xe2\x80\x94we are all inspired with good\r\nfeelings towards each other.  We are of one mind, and think only of love\r\nand friendship.  Those who have quarrelled with absent friends should\r\nkiss and make it up.  Those who happily have not fallen out, can kiss all\r\nthe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the tears in the eyes of both Carrie and her mother, and must say I\r\nfelt very flattered by the compliment.  That dear old Reverend John Panzy\r\nSmith, who married us, made a most cheerful and amusing speech, and said\r\nhe should act on my suggestion respecting the kissing.  He then walked\r\nround the table and kissed all the ladies, including Carrie.  Of course\r\none did not object to this; but I was more than staggered when a young\r\nfellow named Moss, who was a stranger to me, and who had scarcely spoken\r\na word through dinner, jumped up suddenly with a sprig of misletoe, and\r\nexclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cHulloh!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on in this scene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBefore one could realise what he was about to do, he kissed Carrie and\r\nthe rest of the ladies.\r\n\r\nFortunately the matter was treated as a joke, and we all laughed; but it\r\nwas a dangerous experiment, and I felt very uneasy for a moment as to the\r\nresult.  I subsequently referred to the matter to Carrie, but she said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s not much more than a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said that he had a very large\r\nmoustache for a boy.  Carrie replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say he was not a nice\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 26.\xe2\x80\x94I did not sleep very well last night; I never do in a\r\nstrange bed.  I feel a little indigestion, which one must expect at this\r\ntime of the year.  Carrie and I returned to Town in the evening.  Lupin\r\ncame in late.  He said he enjoyed his Christmas, and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as\r\nfit as a Lowther Arcade fiddle, and only require a little more \xe2\x80\x98oof\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nfeel as fit as a \xc2\xa3500 Stradivarius.\xe2\x80\x9d  I have long since given up trying\r\nto understand Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s slang, or asking him to explain it.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 27.\xe2\x80\x94I told Lupin I was expecting Gowing and Cummings to drop in\r\nto-morrow evening for a quiet game.  I was in hope the boy would\r\nvolunteer to stay in, and help to amuse them.  Instead of which, he said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you had better put them off, as I have asked Daisy and Frank Mutlar\r\nto come.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said I could not think of doing such a thing.  Lupin said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will send a wire, and put off Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d  I suggested that a\r\npost-card or letter would reach her quite soon enough, and would not be\r\nso extravagant.\r\n\r\nCarrie, who had listened to the above conversation with apparent\r\nannoyance, directed a well-aimed shaft at Lupin.  She said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin, why\r\ndo you object to Daisy meeting your father\xe2\x80\x99s friends?  Is it because they\r\nare not good enough for her, or (which is equally possible) _she_ is not\r\ngood enough for them?\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin was dumbfounded, and could make no reply.\r\nWhen he left the room, I gave Carrie a kiss of approval.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 28\xe2\x80\x94Lupin, on coming down to breakfast, said to his mother: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave not put off Daisy and Frank, and should like them to join Gowing and\r\nCummings this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d  I felt very pleased with the boy for this.\r\nCarrie said, in reply: \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you let me know in time, as I can turn\r\nover the cold leg of mutton, dress it with a little parsley, and no one\r\nwill know it has been cut.\xe2\x80\x9d  She further said she would make a few\r\ncustards, and stew some pippins, so that they would be cold by the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nFinding Lupin in good spirits, I asked him quietly if he really had any\r\npersonal objection to either Gowing or Cummings.  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNot in the\r\nleast.  I think Cummings looks rather an ass, but that is partly due to\r\nhis patronising \xe2\x80\x98the three-and-six-one-price hat company,\xe2\x80\x99 and wearing a\r\nreach-me-down frock-coat.  As for that perpetual brown velveteen jacket\r\nof Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94why, he resembles an itinerant photographer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said it was not the coat that made the gentleman; whereupon Lupin, with\r\na laugh, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a gentleman who made their\r\ncoats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were rather jolly at supper, and Daisy made herself very agreeable,\r\nespecially in the earlier part of the evening, when she sang.  At supper,\r\nhowever, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cCan you make tee-to-tums with bread?\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\ncommenced rolling up pieces of bread, and twisting them round on the\r\ntable.  I felt this to be bad manners, but of course said nothing.\r\nPresently Daisy and Lupin, to my disgust, began throwing bread-pills at\r\neach other.  Frank followed suit, and so did Cummings and Gowing, to my\r\nastonishment.  They then commenced throwing hard pieces of crust, one\r\npiece catching me on the forehead, and making me blink.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cSteady,\r\nplease; steady!\xe2\x80\x9d  Frank jumped up and said: \xe2\x80\x9cTum, tum; then the band\r\nplayed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not know what this meant, but they all roared, and continued the\r\nbread-battle.  Gowing suddenly seized all the parsley off the cold\r\nmutton, and threw it full in my face.  I looked daggers at Gowing, who\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, it\xe2\x80\x99s no good trying to look indignant, with your hair\r\nfull of parsley.\xe2\x80\x9d  I rose from the table, and insisted that a stop should\r\nbe put to this foolery at once.  Frank Mutlar shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cTime, gentlemen,\r\nplease! time!\xe2\x80\x9d and turned out the gas, leaving us in absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nI was feeling my way out of the room, when I suddenly received a hard\r\nintentional punch at the back of my head.  I said loudly: \xe2\x80\x9cWho did that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was no answer; so I repeated the question, with the same result.  I\r\nstruck a match, and lighted the gas.  They were all talking and laughing,\r\nso I kept my own counsel; but, after they had gone, I said to Carrie;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person who sent me that insulting post-card at Christmas was here\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 29.\xe2\x80\x94I had a most vivid dream last night.  I woke up, and on\r\nfalling asleep, dreamed the same dream over again precisely.  I dreamt I\r\nheard Frank Mutlar telling his sister that he had not only sent me the\r\ninsulting Christmas card, but admitted that he was the one who punched my\r\nhead last night in the dark.  As fate would have it, Lupin, at breakfast,\r\nwas reading extracts from a letter he had just received from Frank.\r\n\r\nI asked him to pass the envelope, that I might compare the writing.  He\r\ndid so, and I examined it by the side of the envelope containing the\r\nChristmas card.  I detected a similarity in the writing, in spite of the\r\nattempted disguise.  I passed them on to Carrie, who began to laugh.  I\r\nasked her what she was laughing at, and she said the card was never\r\ndirected to me at all.  It was \xe2\x80\x9cL. Pooter,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cC. Pooter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin asked\r\nto look at the direction and the card, and exclaimed, with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nyes, Guv., it\xe2\x80\x99s meant for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in the habit of receiving insulting Christmas cards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, and of _sending_ them, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening Gowing called, and said he enjoyed himself very much last\r\nnight.  I took the opportunity to confide in him, as an old friend, about\r\nthe vicious punch last night.  He burst out laughing, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\r\nwas _your head_, was it?  I know I accidentally hit something, but I\r\nthought it was a brick wall.\xe2\x80\x9d  I told him I felt hurt, in both senses of\r\nthe expression.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 30, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin spent the whole day with the Mutlars.  He\r\nseemed rather cheerful in the evening, so I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you so\r\nhappy, Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d  He answered: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Daisy is a splendid girl, but I was\r\nobliged to take her old fool of a father down a peg.  What with his\r\nmeanness over his cigars, his stinginess over his drinks, his farthing\r\neconomy in turning down the gas if you only quit the room for a second,\r\nwriting to one on half-sheets of note-paper, sticking the remnant of the\r\nlast cake of soap on to the new cake, putting two bricks on each side of\r\nthe fireplace, and his general \xe2\x80\x98outside-halfpenny-\xe2\x80\x98bus-ness,\xe2\x80\x99 I was\r\ncompelled to let him have a bit of my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin, you are not\r\nmuch more than a boy; I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t repent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 31.\xe2\x80\x94The last day of the Old Year.  I received an extraordinary\r\nletter from Mr. Mutlar, senior.  He writes: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir,\xe2\x80\x94For a long time\r\npast I have had considerable difficulty deciding the important question,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is the master of my own house?  Myself, or _your son_ Lupin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBelieve me, I have no prejudice one way or the other; but I have been\r\nmost reluctantly compelled to give judgment to the effect that I am the\r\nmaster of it.  Under the circumstances, it has become my duty to forbid\r\nyour son to enter my house again.  I am sorry, because it deprives me of\r\nthe society of one of the most modest, unassuming, and gentlemanly\r\npersons I have ever had the honour of being acquainted with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not desire the last day to wind up disagreeably, so I said nothing\r\nto either Carrie or Lupin about the letter.\r\n\r\nA most terrible fog came on, and Lupin would go out in it, but promised\r\nto be back to drink out the Old Year\xe2\x80\x94a custom we have always observed.\r\nAt a quarter to twelve Lupin had not returned, and the fog was fearful.\r\nAs time was drawing close, I got out the spirits.  Carrie and I deciding\r\non whisky, I opened a fresh bottle; but Carrie said it smelt like brandy.\r\nAs I knew it to be whisky, I said there was nothing to discuss.  Carrie,\r\nevidently vexed that Lupin had not come in, did discuss it all the same,\r\nand wanted me to have a small wager with her to decide by the smell.  I\r\nsaid I could decide it by the taste in a moment.  A silly and unnecessary\r\nargument followed, the result of which was we suddenly saw it was a\r\nquarter-past twelve, and, for the first time in our married life, we\r\nmissed welcoming in the New Year.  Lupin got home at a quarter-past two,\r\nhaving got lost in the fog\xe2\x80\x94so he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBegin the year with an unexpected promotion at the office.  I make two\r\ngood jokes.  I get an enormous rise in my salary.  Lupin speculates\r\nsuccessfully and starts a pony-trap.  Have to speak to Sarah.\r\nExtraordinary conduct of Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 1.\xe2\x80\x94I had intended concluding my diary last week; but a most\r\nimportant event has happened, so I shall continue for a little while\r\nlonger on the fly-leaves attached to the end of my last year\xe2\x80\x99s diary.  It\r\nhad just struck half-past one, and I was on the point of leaving the\r\noffice to have my dinner, when I received a message that Mr. Perkupp\r\ndesired to see me at once.  I must confess that my heart commenced to\r\nbeat and I had most serious misgivings.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkupp was in his room writing, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cTake a seat, Mr.\r\nPooter, I shall not be a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI watched the clock on the mantelpiece, and I was waiting quite twenty\r\nminutes; but it seemed hours.  Mr. Perkupp at last got up himself.\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope there is nothing wrong, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no! quite the reverse, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d  What a weight off\r\nmy mind!  My breath seemed to come back again in an instant.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkupp said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Buckling is going to retire, and there will be\r\nsome slight changes in the office.  You have been with us nearly\r\ntwenty-one years, and, in consequence of your conduct during that period,\r\nwe intend making a special promotion in your favour.  We have not quite\r\ndecided how you will be placed; but in any case there will be a\r\nconsiderable increase in your salary, which, it is quite unnecessary for\r\nme to say, you fully deserve.  I have an appointment at two; but you\r\nshall hear more to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then left the room quickly, and I was not even allowed time or thought\r\nto express a single word of grateful thanks to him.  I need not say how\r\ndear Carrie received this joyful news.  With perfect simplicity she said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last we shall be able to have a chimney-glass for the back\r\ndrawing-room, which we always wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d  I added: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and at last you\r\nshall have that little costume which you saw at Peter Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ncheap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJANUARY 2.\xe2\x80\x94I was in a great state of suspense all day at the office.  I\r\ndid not like to worry Mr. Perkupp; but as he did not send for me, and\r\nmentioned yesterday that he would see me again to-day, I thought it\r\nbetter, perhaps, to go to him.  I knocked at his door, and on entering,\r\nMr. Perkupp said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s you, Mr. Pooter; do you want to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I thought you wanted to see me!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nremember.  Well, I am very busy to-day; I will see you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJANUARY 3.\xe2\x80\x94Still in a state of anxiety and excitement, which was not\r\nalleviated by ascertaining that Mr. Perkupp sent word he should not be at\r\nthe office to-day.  In the evening, Lupin, who was busily engaged with a\r\npaper, said suddenly to me: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything about _chalk pits_,\r\nGuv.?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nI give you the tip; _chalk pits_ are as safe as Consols, and pay six per\r\ncent. at par.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said a rather neat thing, viz.: \xe2\x80\x9cThey may be six per\r\ncent. at _par_, but your _pa_ has no money to invest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie and I both\r\nroared with laughter.  Lupin did not take the slightest notice of the\r\njoke, although I purposely repeated it for him; but continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI give\r\nyou the tip, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94_chalk pits_!\xe2\x80\x9d  I said another funny thing: \xe2\x80\x9cMind\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t fall into them!\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin put on a supercilious smile, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!  Joe Miller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJANUARY 4.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Perkupp sent for me and told me that my position would be\r\nthat of one of the senior clerks.  I was more than overjoyed.  Mr.\r\nPerkupp added, he would let me know to-morrow what the salary would be.\r\nThis means another day\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, for it is anxiety of the\r\nright sort.  That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin\r\nabout the letter I received from Mr. Mutlar, senr.  I broached the\r\nsubject to Lupin in the evening, having first consulted Carrie.  Lupin\r\nwas riveted to the _Financial News_, as if he had been a born capitalist,\r\nand I said: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me a moment, Lupin, how is it you have not been to\r\nthe Mutlars\xe2\x80\x99 any day this week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI told you!  I cannot stand old Mutlar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mutlar writes to me to say pretty plainly that he cannot\r\nstand you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I like his cheek in writing to _you_.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll find out\r\nif his father is still alive, and I will write _him_ a note complaining\r\nof _his_ son, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll state pretty clearly that his son is a blithering\r\nidiot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin, please moderate your expressions in the presence of your\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, but there is no other expression one can\r\napply to him.  However, I\xe2\x80\x99m determined not to enter his place again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Lupin, he has forbidden you the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we won\xe2\x80\x99t split straws\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same.  Daisy is\r\na trump, and will wait for me ten years, if necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5.\xe2\x80\x94I can scarcely write the news.  Mr. Perkupp told me my salary\r\nwould be raised \xc2\xa3100!  I stood gaping for a moment unable to realise it.\r\nI annually get \xc2\xa310 rise, and I thought it might be \xc2\xa315 or even \xc2\xa320; but\r\n\xc2\xa3100 surpasses all belief.  Carrie and I both rejoiced over our good\r\nfortune.  Lupin came home in the evening in the utmost good spirits.  I\r\nsent Sarah quietly round to the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s for a bottle of champagne, the\r\nsame as we had before, \xe2\x80\x9cJackson Fr\xc3\xa8res.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was opened at supper, and I\r\nsaid to Lupin: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is to celebrate some good news I have received\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHooray, Guv.!  And I have some good news, also;\r\na double event, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, as a result of twenty-one years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nindustry and strict attention to the interests of my superiors in office,\r\nI have been rewarded with promotion and a rise in salary of \xc2\xa3100.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin gave three cheers, and we rapped the table furiously, which brought\r\nin Sarah to see what the matter was.  Lupin ordered us to \xe2\x80\x9cfill up\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nagain, and addressing us upstanding, said: \xe2\x80\x9cHaving been in the firm of\r\nJob Cleanands, stock and share-brokers, a few weeks, and not having paid\r\nparticular attention to the interests of my superiors in office, my\r\nGuv\xe2\x80\x99nor, as a reward to me, allotted me \xc2\xa35 worth of shares in a really\r\ngood thing.  The result is, to-day I have made \xc2\xa3200.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin,\r\nyou are joking.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Guv., it\xe2\x80\x99s the good old truth; Job Cleanands _put\r\nme on to Chlorates_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJANUARY 21.\xe2\x80\x94I am very much concerned at Lupin having started a pony-trap.\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin, are you justified in this outrageous extravagance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLupin replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, one must get to the City somehow.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve only hired\r\nit, and can give it up any time I like.\xe2\x80\x9d  I repeated my question: \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou justified in this extravagance?\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Guv.,\r\nexcuse me saying so, but you\xe2\x80\x99re a bit out of date.  It does not pay\r\nnowadays, fiddling about over small things.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything\r\npersonal, Guv\xe2\x80\x99nor.  My boss says if I take his tip, and stick to big\r\nthings, I can make big money!\xe2\x80\x9d  I said I thought the very idea of\r\nspeculation most horrifying.  Lupin said \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not speculation, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndead cert.\xe2\x80\x9d  I advised him, at all events, not to continue the pony and\r\ncart; but he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI made \xc2\xa3200 in one day; now suppose I only make\r\n\xc2\xa3200 in a month, or put it at \xc2\xa3100 a month, which is ridiculously\r\nlow\xe2\x80\x94why, that is \xc2\xa31,250 a year.  What\xe2\x80\x99s a few pounds a week for a trap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not pursue the subject further, beyond saying that I should feel\r\nglad when the autumn came, and Lupin would be of age and responsible for\r\nhis own debts.  He answered: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Guv., I promise you faithfully that\r\nI will never speculate with what I have not got.  I shall only go on Job\r\nCleanands\xe2\x80\x99 tips, and as he is in the \xe2\x80\x98know\xe2\x80\x99 it is pretty safe sailing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI felt somewhat relieved.  Gowing called in the evening and, to my\r\nsurprise, informed me that, as he had made \xc2\xa310 by one of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s tips, he\r\nintended asking us and the Cummings round next Saturday.  Carrie and I\r\nsaid we should be delighted.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 22.\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t generally lose my temper with servants; but I had to\r\nspeak to Sarah rather sharply about a careless habit she has recently\r\ncontracted of shaking the table-cloth, after removing the breakfast\r\nthings, in a manner which causes all the crumbs to fall on the carpet,\r\neventually to be trodden in.  Sarah answered very rudely: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are\r\nalways complaining.\xe2\x80\x9d  I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I am not.  I spoke to you last\r\nweek about walking all over the drawing-room carpet with a piece of\r\nyellow soap on the heel of your boot.\xe2\x80\x9d  She said: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re always\r\ngrumbling about your breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not; but I feel\r\nperfectly justified in complaining that I never can get a hard-boiled\r\negg.  The moment I crack the shell it spurts all over the plate, and I\r\nhave spoken to you at least fifty times about it.\xe2\x80\x9d  She began to cry and\r\nmake a scene; but fortunately my \xe2\x80\x99bus came by, so I had a good excuse for\r\nleaving her.  Gowing left a message in the evening, that we were not to\r\nforget next Saturday.  Carrie amusingly said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs he has never asked any\r\nfriends before, we are not likely to forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJANUARY 23.\xe2\x80\x94I asked Lupin to try and change the hard brushes, he recently\r\nmade me a present of, for some softer ones, as my hair-dresser tells me I\r\nought not to brush my hair too much just now.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 24.\xe2\x80\x94The new chimney-glass came home for the back drawing-room.\r\nCarrie arranged some fans very prettily on the top and on each side.  It\r\nis an immense improvement to the room.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 25.\xe2\x80\x94We had just finished our tea, when who should come in but\r\nCummings, who has not been here for over three weeks.  I noticed that he\r\nlooked anything but well, so I said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cummings, how are you?  You\r\nlook a little blue.\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes! and I feel blue too.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing, except that I have been\r\non my back for a couple of weeks, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.  At one time my doctor\r\nnearly gave me up, yet not a soul has come near me.  No one has even\r\ntaken the trouble to inquire whether I was alive or dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first I have heard of it.  I have passed your house\r\nseveral nights, and presumed you had company, as the rooms were so\r\nbrilliantly lighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCummings replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo!  The only company I have had was my wife, the\r\ndoctor, and the landlady\xe2\x80\x94the last-named having turned out a perfect\r\ntrump.  I wonder you did not see it in the paper.  I know it was\r\nmentioned in the _Bicycle News_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought to cheer him up, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are all right now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the question.  The question is whether an illness\r\ndoes not enable you to discover who are your _true_ friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said such an observation was unworthy of him.  To make matters worse,\r\nin came Gowing, who gave Cummings a violent slap on the back, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloh!  Have you seen a ghost?  You look scared to death, like Irving\r\nin _Macbeth_.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cGently, Gowing, the poor fellow has been very\r\nill.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing roared with laughter and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you look it, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCummings quietly said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I feel it too\xe2\x80\x94not that I suppose you\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn awkward silence followed.  Gowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Cummings, you and\r\nthe missis come round to my place to-morrow, and it will cheer you up a\r\nbit; for we\xe2\x80\x99ll open a bottle of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJANUARY 26.\xe2\x80\x94An extraordinary thing happened.  Carrie and I went round to\r\nGowing\xe2\x80\x99s, as arranged, at half-past seven.  We knocked and rang several\r\ntimes without getting an answer.  At last the latch was drawn and the\r\ndoor opened a little way, the chain still being up.  A man in\r\nshirt-sleeves put his head through and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?  What do you\r\nwant?\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gowing, he is expecting us.\xe2\x80\x9d  The man said (as well\r\nas I could hear, owing to the yapping of a little dog): \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\r\nis.  Mr. Gowing is not at home.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be in directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that observation he slammed the door, leaving Carrie and me standing\r\non the steps with a cutting wind blowing round the corner.\r\n\r\nCarrie advised me to knock again.  I did so, and then discovered for the\r\nfirst time that the knocker had been newly painted, and the paint had\r\ncome off on my gloves\xe2\x80\x94which were, in consequence, completely spoiled.\r\n\r\nI knocked at the door with my stick two or three times.\r\n\r\nThe man opened the door, taking the chain off this time, and began\r\nabusing me.  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by scratching the paint with your\r\nstick like that, spoiling the varnish?  You ought to be ashamed of\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Mr. Gowing invited\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe interrupted and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for Mr. Gowing, or any of his\r\nfriends.  This is _my_ door, not Mr. Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s.  There are people here\r\nbesides Mr. Gowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impertinence of this man was nothing.  I scarcely noticed it, it was\r\nso trivial in comparison with the scandalous conduct of Gowing.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Cummings and his wife arrived.  Cummings was very lame and\r\nleaning on a stick; but got up the steps and asked what the matter was.\r\n\r\nThe man said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gowing said nothing about expecting anyone.  All he\r\nsaid was he had just received an invitation to Croydon, and he should not\r\nbe back till Monday evening.  He took his bag with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he slammed the door again.  I was too indignant with Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct to say anything.  Cummings looked white with rage, and as he\r\ndescended the steps struck his stick violently on the ground and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nGowing explains his conduct.  Lupin takes us for a drive, which we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nenjoy.  Lupin introduces us to Mr. Murray Posh.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 8.\xe2\x80\x94It does seem hard I cannot get good sausages for breakfast.\r\nThey are either full of bread or spice, or are as red as beef.  Still\r\nanxious about the \xc2\xa320 I invested last week by Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s advice.  However,\r\nCummings has done the same.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 9.\xe2\x80\x94Exactly a fortnight has passed, and I have neither seen nor\r\nheard from Gowing respecting his extraordinary conduct in asking us round\r\nto his house, and then being out.  In the evening Carrie was engaged\r\nmarking a half-dozen new collars I had purchased.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll back Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarking against anybody\xe2\x80\x99s.  While I was drying them at the fire, and\r\nCarrie was rebuking me for scorching them, Cummings came in.\r\n\r\nHe seemed quite well again, and chaffed us about marking the collars.  I\r\nasked him if he had heard from Gowing, and he replied that he had not.  I\r\nsaid I should not have believed that Gowing could have acted in such an\r\nungentlemanly manner.  Cummings said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mild in your description\r\nof him; I think he has acted like a cad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth when the door opened, and\r\nGowing, putting in his head, said: \xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCarrie said very pointedly: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _are_ a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on and off to Croydon during the last fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\ncould see Cummings was boiling over, and eventually he tackled Gowing\r\nvery strongly respecting his conduct last Saturday week.  Gowing appeared\r\nsurprised, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I posted a letter to you in the morning\r\nannouncing that the party was \xe2\x80\x98off, very much off.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\ngot it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing, turning to Carrie, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose letters sometimes\r\n_miscarry_, don\xe2\x80\x99t they, _Mrs._ Carrie?\xe2\x80\x9d  Cummings sharply said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nnot a time for joking.  I had no notice of the party being put off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGowing replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI told Pooter in my note to tell you, as I was in a\r\nhurry.  However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll inquire at the post-office, and we must meet again\r\nat my place.\xe2\x80\x9d  I added that I hoped he would be present at the next\r\nmeeting.  Carrie roared at this, and even Cummings could not help\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 10, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Contrary to my wishes, Carrie allowed Lupin to\r\npersuade her to take her for a drive in the afternoon in his trap.  I\r\nquite disapprove of driving on a Sunday, but I did not like to trust\r\nCarrie alone with Lupin, so I offered to go too.  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\r\nis nice of you, Guv., but you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind sitting on the back-seat of the\r\ncart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin proceeded to put on a bright-blue coat that seemed miles too large\r\nfor him.  Carrie said it wanted taking in considerably at the back.\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen a box-coat before?  You can\xe2\x80\x99t drive in\r\nanything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe may wear what he likes in the future, for I shall never drive with him\r\nagain.  His conduct was shocking.  When we passed Highgate Archway, he\r\ntried to pass everything and everybody.  He shouted to respectable people\r\nwho were walking quietly in the road to get out of the way; he flicked at\r\nthe horse of an old man who was riding, causing it to rear; and, as I had\r\nto ride backwards, I was compelled to face a gang of roughs in a\r\ndonkey-cart, whom Lupin had chaffed, and who turned and followed us for\r\nnearly a mile, bellowing, indulging in coarse jokes and laughter, to say\r\nnothing of occasionally pelting us with orange-peel.\r\n\r\nLupin\xe2\x80\x99s excuse\xe2\x80\x94that the Prince of Wales would have to put up with the\r\nsame sort of thing if he drove to the Derby\xe2\x80\x94was of little consolation to\r\neither Carrie or myself.  Frank Mutlar called in the evening, and Lupin\r\nwent out with him.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11.\xe2\x80\x94Feeling a little concerned about Lupin, I mustered up\r\ncourage to speak to Mr. Perkupp about him.  Mr. Perkupp has always been\r\nmost kind to me, so I told him everything, including yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadventure.  Mr. Perkupp kindly replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity for you to\r\nbe anxious, Mr. Pooter.  It would be impossible for a son of such good\r\nparents to turn out erroneously.  Remember he is young, and will soon get\r\nolder.  I wish we could find room for him in this firm.\xe2\x80\x9d  The advice of\r\nthis good man takes loads off my mind.  In the evening Lupin came in.\r\n\r\nAfter our little supper, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear parents, I have some news,\r\nwhich I fear will affect you considerably.\xe2\x80\x9d  I felt a qualm come over me,\r\nand said nothing.  Lupin then said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt may distress you\xe2\x80\x94in fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure it will\xe2\x80\x94but this afternoon I have given up my pony and trap for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d  It may seem absurd, but I was so pleased, I immediately opened a\r\nbottle of port.  Gowing dropped in just in time, bringing with him a\r\nlarge sheet, with a print of a tailless donkey, which he fastened against\r\nthe wall.  He then produced several separate tails, and we spent the\r\nremainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the\r\nproper place.  My sides positively ached with laughter when I went to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 12.\xe2\x80\x94In the evening I spoke to Lupin about his engagement with\r\nDaisy Mutlar.  I asked if he had heard from her.  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo; she\r\npromised that old windbag of a father of hers that she would not\r\ncommunicate with me.  I see Frank Mutlar, of course; in fact, he said he\r\nmight call again this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d  Frank called, but said he could not\r\nstop, as he had a friend waiting outside for him, named Murray Posh,\r\nadding he was quite a swell.  Carrie asked Frank to bring him in.\r\n\r\nHe was brought in, Gowing entering at the same time.  Mr. Murray Posh was\r\na tall, fat young man, and was evidently of a very nervous disposition,\r\nas he subsequently confessed he would never go in a hansom cab, nor would\r\nhe enter a four-wheeler until the driver had first got on the box with\r\nhis reins in his hands.\r\n\r\nOn being introduced, Gowing, with his usual want of tact, said: \xe2\x80\x9cAny\r\nrelation to \xe2\x80\x98Posh\xe2\x80\x99s three-shilling hats\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Posh replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes; but\r\nplease understand I don\xe2\x80\x99t try on hats myself.  I take no _active_ part in\r\nthe business.\xe2\x80\x9d  I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had a business like it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Posh\r\nseemed pleased, and gave a long but most interesting history of the\r\nextraordinary difficulties in the manufacture of cheap hats.\r\n\r\nMurray Posh evidently knew Daisy Mutlar very intimately from the way he\r\nwas talking of her; and Frank said to Lupin once, laughingly: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look out, Posh will cut you out!\xe2\x80\x9d  When they had all gone, I\r\nreferred to this flippant conversation; and Lupin said, sarcastically: \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nman who is jealous has no respect for himself.  A man who would be\r\njealous of an elephant like Murray Posh could only have a contempt for\r\nhimself.  I know Daisy.  She _would_ wait ten years for me, as I said\r\nbefore; in fact, if necessary, _she would wait twenty years for me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe lose money over Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s advice as to investment, so does Cummings.\r\nMurray Posh engaged to Daisy Mutlar.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18.\xe2\x80\x94Carrie has several times recently called attention to the\r\nthinness of my hair at the top of my head, and recommended me to get it\r\nseen to.  I was this morning trying to look at it by the aid of a small\r\nhand-glass, when somehow my elbow caught against the edge of the chest of\r\ndrawers and knocked the glass out of my hand and smashed it.  Carrie was\r\nin an awful way about it, as she is rather absurdly superstitious.  To\r\nmake matters worse, my large photograph in the drawing-room fell during\r\nthe night, and the glass cracked.\r\n\r\nCarrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cMark my words, Charles, some misfortune is about to\r\nhappen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening Lupin arrived home early, and seemed a little agitated.  I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d  He hesitated a good deal, and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow those Parachikka Chlorates I advised you to invest \xc2\xa320 in?\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are all right, I trust?\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, no!  To\r\nthe surprise of everybody, they have utterly collapsed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy breath was so completely taken away, I could say nothing.  Carrie\r\nlooked at me, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin, after a while,\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, you are specially fortunate.  I received an early tip,\r\nand sold out yours immediately, and was fortunate to get \xc2\xa32 for them.  So\r\nyou get something after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave a sigh of relief.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was not so sanguine as to suppose,\r\nas you predicted, that I should get six or eight times the amount of my\r\ninvestment; still a profit of \xc2\xa32 is a good percentage for such a short\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin said, quite irritably: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.  I sold your\r\n\xc2\xa320 shares for \xc2\xa32; you therefore lose \xc2\xa318 on the transaction, whereby\r\nCummings and Gowing will lose the whole of theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin, before going to town, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry about\r\nthose Parachikka Chlorates; it would not have happened if the boss, Job\r\nCleanands, had been in town.  Between ourselves, you must not be\r\nsurprised if something goes wrong at our office.  Job Cleanands has not\r\nbeen seen the last few days, and it strikes me several people _do_ want\r\nto see him very particularly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening Lupin was just on the point of going out to avoid a\r\ncollision with Gowing and Cummings, when the former entered the room,\r\nwithout knocking, but with his usual trick of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe entered, and to the surprise of Lupin and myself, seemed to be in the\r\nvery best of spirits.  Neither Lupin nor I broached the subject to him,\r\nbut he did so of his own accord.  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, those Parachikka\r\nChlorates have gone an awful smash!  You\xe2\x80\x99re a nice one, Master Lupin.\r\nHow much do you lose?\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin, to my utter astonishment, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh!  I\r\nhad nothing in them.  There was some informality in my application\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nforgot to enclose the cheque or something, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any.  The\r\nGuv. loses \xc2\xa318.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI quite understood you were in it, or nothing\r\nwould have induced me to speculate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nhelped; you must go double on the next tip.\xe2\x80\x9d  Before I could reply,\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I lose nothing, fortunately.  From what I heard, I\r\ndid not quite believe in them, so I persuaded Cummings to take my \xc2\xa315\r\nworth, as he had more faith in them than I had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin burst out laughing, and, in the most unseemly manner, said: \xe2\x80\x9cAlas,\r\npoor Cummings.  He\xe2\x80\x99ll lose \xc2\xa335.\xe2\x80\x9d  At that moment there was a ring at the\r\nbell.  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet Cummings.\xe2\x80\x9d  If he had gone out\r\nof the door he would have met him in the passage, so as quickly as\r\npossible Lupin opened the parlour window and got out.  Gowing jumped up\r\nsuddenly, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see him either!\xe2\x80\x9d and, before I\r\ncould say a word, he followed Lupin out of the window.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I was horrified to think my own son and one of my most\r\nintimate friends should depart from the house like a couple of\r\ninterrupted burglars.  Poor Cummings was very upset, and of course was\r\nnaturally very angry both with Lupin and Gowing.  I pressed him to have a\r\nlittle whisky, and he replied that he had given up whisky; but would like\r\na little \xe2\x80\x9cUnsweetened,\xe2\x80\x9d as he was advised it was the most healthy spirit.\r\nI had none in the house, but sent Sarah round to Lockwood\xe2\x80\x99s for some.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 20.\xe2\x80\x94The first thing that caught my eye on opening the _Standard_\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Failure of Stock and Share Dealers!  Mr. Job Cleanands\r\nabsconded!\xe2\x80\x9d  I handed it to Carrie, and she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s good.  I never did think it a suitable situation for him.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\nthought the whole affair very shocking.\r\n\r\nLupin came down to breakfast, and seeing he looked painfully distressed,\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know the news, my dear boy, and feel very sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know? who told you?\xe2\x80\x9d  I handed him the\r\n_Standard_.  He threw the paper down, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a button\r\nfor that!  I expected that, but I did not expect this.\xe2\x80\x9d  He then read a\r\nletter from Frank Mutlar, announcing, in a cool manner, that Daisy Mutlar\r\nis to be married next month to Murray Posh.  I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cMurray Posh!\r\nIs not that the very man Frank had the impudence to bring here last\r\nTuesday week?\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes; the \xe2\x80\x98_Posh\xe2\x80\x99s-three-shilling-hats_\xe2\x80\x99\r\nchap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all then ate our breakfast in dead silence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I could eat nothing.  I was not only too worried, but I cannot\r\nand will not eat cushion of bacon.  If I cannot get streaky bacon, I will\r\ndo without anything.\r\n\r\nWhen Lupin rose to go I noticed a malicious smile creep over his face.  I\r\nasked him what it meant.  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! only a little\r\nconsolation\xe2\x80\x94still it is a consolation.  I have just remembered that, by\r\n_my_ advice, Mr. Murray Posh has invested \xc2\xa3600 in Parachikka Chlorates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMarriage of Daisy Mutlar and Murray Posh.  The dream of my life realised.\r\nMr. Perkupp takes Lupin into the office.\r\n\r\nMARCH 20.\xe2\x80\x94To-day being the day on which Daisy Mutlar and Mr. Murray Posh\r\nare to be married, Lupin has gone with a friend to spend the day at\r\nGravesend.  Lupin has been much cut-up over the affair, although he\r\ndeclares that he is glad it is off.  I wish he would not go to so many\r\nmusic-halls, but one dare not say anything to him about it.  At the\r\npresent moment he irritates me by singing all over the house some\r\nnonsense about \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Gladstone?  He\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Lupin?  He\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d  _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t think either\r\nof them is.  In the evening Gowing called, and the chief topic of\r\nconversation was Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Murray Posh.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was glad\r\nthe matter was at an end, as Daisy would only have made a fool of Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGowing, with his usual good taste, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Master Lupin can make a\r\nfool of himself without any assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie very properly resented\r\nthis, and Gowing had sufficient sense to say he was sorry.\r\n\r\nMARCH 21.\xe2\x80\x94To-day I shall conclude my diary, for it is one of the happiest\r\ndays of my life.  My great dream of the last few weeks\xe2\x80\x94in fact, of many\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94has been realised.  This morning came a letter from Mr. Perkupp,\r\nasking me to take Lupin down to the office with me.  I went to Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom; poor fellow, he seemed very pale, and said he had a bad headache.\r\nHe had come back yesterday from Gravesend, where he spent part of the day\r\nin a small boat on the water, having been mad enough to neglect to take\r\nhis overcoat with him.  I showed him Mr. Perkupp\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and he got up\r\nas quickly as possible.  I begged of him not to put on his fast-coloured\r\nclothes and ties, but to dress in something black or quiet-looking.\r\n\r\nCarrie was all of a tremble when she read the letter, and all she could\r\nkeep on saying was: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _do_ hope it will be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d  For myself,\r\nI could scarcely eat any breakfast.  Lupin came down dressed quietly, and\r\nlooking a perfect gentleman, except that his face was rather yellow.\r\nCarrie, by way of encouragement said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou do look nice, Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good make-up, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  A\r\nregular-downright-respectable-funereal-first-class-City-firm-junior-\r\nclerk.\xe2\x80\x9d  He laughed rather ironically.\r\n\r\nIn the hall I heard a great noise, and also Lupin shouting to Sarah to\r\nfetch down his old hat.  I went into the passage, and found Lupin in a\r\nfury, kicking and smashing a new tall hat.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cLupin, my boy, what\r\nare you doing?  How wicked of you!  Some poor fellow would be glad to\r\nhave it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI would not insult any poor fellow by giving\r\nit to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone outside, I picked up the battered hat, and saw inside\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPosh\xe2\x80\x99s Patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Poor Lupin!  I can forgive him.  It seemed hours before\r\nwe reached the office.  Mr. Perkupp sent for Lupin, who was with him\r\nnearly an hour.  He returned, as I thought, crestfallen in appearance.  I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lupin, how about Mr. Perkupp?\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin commenced his song:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Perkupp?  He\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d  I felt instinctively\r\nmy boy was engaged.  I went to Mr. Perkupp, but I could not speak.  He\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Pooter, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d  I must have looked a fool, for all\r\nI could say was: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Perkupp, you are a good man.\xe2\x80\x9d  He looked at me for\r\na moment, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Pooter, _you_ are the good man; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee if we cannot get your son to follow such an excellent example.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Perkupp, may I go home?  I cannot work any more to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy good master shook my hand warmly as he nodded his head.  It was as\r\nmuch as I could do to prevent myself from crying in the \xe2\x80\x99bus; in fact, I\r\nshould have done so, had my thoughts not been interrupted by Lupin, who\r\nwas having a quarrel with a fat man in the \xe2\x80\x99bus, whom he accused of\r\ntaking up too much room.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Carrie sent round for dear old friend Cummings and his\r\nwife, and also to Gowing.  We all sat round the fire, and in a bottle of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJackson Fr\xc3\xa8res,\xe2\x80\x9d which Sarah fetched from the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s, drank Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth.  I lay awake for hours, thinking of the future.  My boy in the\r\nsame office as myself\xe2\x80\x94we can go down together by the \xe2\x80\x99bus, come home\r\ntogether, and who knows but in the course of time he may take great\r\ninterest in our little home.  That he may help me to put a nail in here\r\nor a nail in there, or help his dear mother to hang a picture.  In the\r\nsummer he may help us in our little garden with the flowers, and assist\r\nus to paint the stands and pots.  (By-the-by, I must get in some more\r\nenamel paint.)  All this I thought over and over again, and a thousand\r\nhappy thoughts beside.  I heard the clock strike four, and soon after\r\nfell asleep, only to dream of three happy people\xe2\x80\x94Lupin, dear Carrie, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTrouble with a stylographic pen.  We go to a Volunteer Ball, where I am\r\nlet in for an expensive supper.  Grossly insulted by a cabman.  An odd\r\ninvitation to Southend.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 8.\xe2\x80\x94No events of any importance, except that Gowing strongly\r\nrecommended a new patent stylographic pen, which cost me\r\nnine-and-sixpence, and which was simply nine-and-sixpence thrown in the\r\nmud.  It has caused me constant annoyance and irritability of temper.\r\nThe ink oozes out of the top, making a mess on my hands, and once at the\r\noffice when I was knocking the palm of my hand on the desk to jerk the\r\nink down, Mr. Perkupp, who had just entered, called out: \xe2\x80\x9cStop that\r\nknocking!  I suppose that is you, Mr. Pitt?\xe2\x80\x9d  That young monkey, Pitt,\r\ntook a malicious glee in responding quite loudly: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; I beg pardon,\r\nit is Mr. Pooter with his pen; it has been going on all the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d  To\r\nmake matters worse, I saw Lupin laughing behind his desk.  I thought it\r\nwiser to say nothing.  I took the pen back to the shop and asked them if\r\nthey would take it back, as it did not act.  I did not expect the full\r\nprice returned, but was willing to take half.  The man said he could not\r\ndo that\xe2\x80\x94buying and selling were two different things.  Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\r\nduring the period he has been in Mr. Perkupp\xe2\x80\x99s office has been most\r\nexemplary.  My only fear is, it is too good to last.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 9.\xe2\x80\x94Gowing called, bringing with him an invitation for Carrie and\r\nmyself to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which he thought\r\nwould be a swell affair, as the member for East Acton (Sir William Grime)\r\nhad promised his patronage.  We accepted of his kindness, and he stayed\r\nto supper, an occasion I thought suitable for trying a bottle of the\r\nsparkling Alg\xc3\xa9ra that Mr. James (of Sutton) had sent as a present.\r\nGowing sipped the wine, observing that he had never tasted it before, and\r\nfurther remarked that his policy was to stick to more recognised brands.\r\nI told him it was a present from a dear friend, and one mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look a\r\ngift-horse in the mouth.  Gowing facetiously replied: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nputting it in the mouth either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought the remarks were rude without being funny, but on tasting it\r\nmyself, came to the conclusion there was some justification for them.\r\nThe sparkling Alg\xc3\xa9ra is very like cider, only more sour.  I suggested\r\nthat perhaps the thunder had turned it a bit acid.  He merely replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xe2\x80\x9d  We had a very pleasant game of cards, though I\r\nlost four shillings and Carrie lost one, and Gowing said he had lost\r\nabout sixpence: how he could have lost, considering that Carrie and I\r\nwere the only other players, remains a mystery.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 14, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Owing, I presume, to the unsettled weather, I awoke\r\nwith a feeling that my skin was drawn over my face as tight as a drum.\r\nWalking round the garden with Mr. and Mrs. Treane, members of our\r\ncongregation who had walked back with us, I was much annoyed to find a\r\nlarge newspaper full of bones on the gravel-path, evidently thrown over\r\nby those young Griffin boys next door; who, whenever we have friends,\r\nclimb up the empty steps inside their conservatory, tap at the windows,\r\nmaking faces, whistling, and imitating birds.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 15.\xe2\x80\x94Burnt my tongue most awfully with the Worcester sauce, through\r\nthat stupid girl Sarah shaking the bottle violently before putting it on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 16.\xe2\x80\x94The night of the East Acton Volunteer Ball.  On my advice,\r\nCarrie put on the same dress that she looked so beautiful in at the\r\nMansion House, for it had occurred to me, being a military ball, that Mr.\r\nPerkupp, who, I believe, is an officer in the Honorary Artillery Company,\r\nwould in all probability be present.  Lupin, in his usual\r\nincomprehensible language, remarked that he had heard it was a \xe2\x80\x9cbounders\xe2\x80\x99\r\nball.\xe2\x80\x9d  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him what he meant though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.  Where\r\nhe gets these expressions from I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; he certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t learn\r\nthem at home.\r\n\r\nThe invitation was for half-past eight, so I concluded if we arrived an\r\nhour later we should be in good time, without being \xe2\x80\x9cunfashionable,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nMrs. James says.  It was very difficult to find\xe2\x80\x94the cabman having to get\r\ndown several times to inquire at different public-houses where the Drill\r\nHall was.  I wonder at people living in such out-of-the-way places.  No\r\none seemed to know it.  However, after going up and down a good many\r\nbadly-lighted streets we arrived at our destination.  I had no idea it\r\nwas so far from Holloway.  I gave the cabman five shillings, who only\r\ngrumbled, saying it was dirt cheap at half-a-sovereign, and was\r\nimpertinent enough to advise me the next time I went to a ball to take a\r\n\xe2\x80\x99bus.\r\n\r\nCaptain Welcut received us, saying we were rather late, but that it was\r\nbetter late than never.  He seemed a very good-looking gentleman though,\r\nas Carrie remarked, \xe2\x80\x9crather short for an officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  He begged to be\r\nexcused for leaving us, as he was engaged for a dance, and hoped we\r\nshould make ourselves at home.  Carrie took my arm and we walked round\r\nthe rooms two or three times and watched the people dancing.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind a single person I knew, but attributed it to most of them being in\r\nuniform.  As we were entering the supper-room I received a slap on the\r\nshoulder, followed by a welcome shake of the hand.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Padge, I\r\nbelieve;\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave Carrie a chair, and seated by her was a lady who made herself at\r\nhome with Carrie at once.\r\n\r\nThere was a very liberal repast on the tables, plenty of champagne,\r\nclaret, etc., and, in fact, everything seemed to be done regardless of\r\nexpense.  Mr. Padge is a man that, I admit, I have no particular liking\r\nfor, but I felt so glad to come across someone I knew, that I asked him\r\nto sit at our table, and I must say that for a short fat man he looked\r\nwell in uniform, although I think his tunic was rather baggy in the back.\r\nIt was the only supper-room that I have been in that was not\r\nover-crowded; in fact we were the only people there, everybody being so\r\nbusy dancing.\r\n\r\nI assisted Carrie and her newly-formed acquaintance, who said her name\r\nwas Lupkin, to some champagne; also myself, and handed the bottle to Mr.\r\nPadge to do likewise, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must look after yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d  He\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d and poured out half a tumbler and drank Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth, coupled, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith her worthy lord and master.\xe2\x80\x9d  We all\r\nhad some splendid pigeon pie, and ices to follow.\r\n\r\nThe waiters were very attentive, and asked if we would like some more\r\nwine.  I assisted Carrie and her friend and Mr. Padge, also some people\r\nwho had just come from the dancing-room, who were very civil.  It\r\noccurred to me at the time that perhaps some of the gentlemen knew me in\r\nthe City, as they were so polite.  I made myself useful, and assisted\r\nseveral ladies to ices, remembering an old saying that \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing\r\nlost by civility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe band struck up for the dance, and they all went into the ball-room.\r\nThe ladies (Carrie and Mrs. Lupkin) were anxious to see the dancing, and\r\nas I had not quite finished my supper, Mr. Padge offered his arms to them\r\nand escorted them to the ball-room, telling me to follow.  I said to Mr.\r\nPadge: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite a West End affair,\xe2\x80\x9d to which remark Mr. Padge\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I had quite finished my supper, and was leaving, the waiter who had\r\nbeen attending on us arrested my attention by tapping me on the shoulder.\r\nI thought it unusual for a waiter at a private ball to expect a tip, but\r\nnevertheless gave a shilling, as he had been very attentive.  He\r\nsmilingly replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir, this is no good,\xe2\x80\x9d alluding to\r\nthe shilling.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour party\xe2\x80\x99s had four suppers at 5s. a head, five ices at\r\n1s., three bottles of champagne at 11s. 6d., a glass of claret, and a\r\nsixpenny cigar for the stout gentleman\xe2\x80\x94in all \xc2\xa33 0s. 6d.!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I was ever so surprised in my life, and had only sufficient\r\nbreath to inform him that I had received a private invitation, to which\r\nhe answered that he was perfectly well aware of that; but that the\r\ninvitation didn\xe2\x80\x99t include eatables and drinkables.  A gentleman who was\r\nstanding at the bar corroborated the waiter\xe2\x80\x99s statement, and assured me\r\nit was quite correct.\r\n\r\nThe waiter said he was extremely sorry if I had been under any\r\nmisapprehension; but it was not his fault.  Of course there was nothing\r\nto be done but to pay.  So, after turning out my pockets, I just managed\r\nto scrape up sufficient, all but nine shillings; but the manager, on my\r\ngiving my card to him, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever felt more humiliated in my life, and I determined to\r\nkeep this misfortune from Carrie, for it would entirely destroy the\r\npleasant evening she was enjoying.  I felt there was no more enjoyment\r\nfor me that evening, and it being late, I sought Carrie and Mrs. Lupkin.\r\nCarrie said she was quite ready to go, and Mrs. Lupkin, as we were\r\nwishing her \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Carrie and myself if we ever paid a visit\r\nto Southend?  On my replying that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been there for many years, she\r\nvery kindly said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come down and stay at our place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs her invitation was so pressing, and observing that Carrie wished to\r\ngo, we promised we would visit her the next Saturday week, and stay till\r\nMonday.  Mrs. Lupkin said she would write to us to-morrow, giving us the\r\naddress and particulars of trains, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen we got outside the Drill Hall it was raining so hard that the roads\r\nresembled canals, and I need hardly say we had great difficulty in\r\ngetting a cabman to take us to Holloway.  After waiting a bit, a man said\r\nhe would drive us, anyhow, as far as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Angel,\xe2\x80\x9d at Islington, and we\r\ncould easily get another cab from there.  It was a tedious journey; the\r\nrain was beating against the windows and trickling down the inside of the\r\ncab.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Angel\xe2\x80\x9d the horse seemed tired out.  Carrie got\r\nout and ran into a doorway, and when I came to pay, to my absolute horror\r\nI remembered I had no money, nor had Carrie.  I explained to the cabman\r\nhow we were situated.  Never in my life have I ever been so insulted; the\r\ncabman, who was a rough bully and to my thinking not sober, called me\r\nevery name he could lay his tongue to, and positively seized me by the\r\nbeard, which he pulled till the tears came into my eyes.  I took the\r\nnumber of a policeman (who witnessed the assault) for not taking the man\r\nin charge.  The policeman said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere, that he had seen no\r\nassault, and that people should not ride in cabs without money.\r\n\r\nWe had to walk home in the pouring rain, nearly two miles, and when I got\r\nin I put down the conversation I had with the cabman, word for word, as I\r\nintend writing to the _Telegraph_ for the purpose of proposing that cabs\r\nshould be driven only by men under Government control, to prevent\r\ncivilians being subjected to the disgraceful insult and outrage that I\r\nhad had to endure.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 17.\xe2\x80\x94No water in our cistern again.  Sent for Putley, who said he\r\nwould soon remedy that, the cistern being zinc.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 18.\xe2\x80\x94Water all right again in the cistern.  Mrs. James, of Sutton,\r\ncalled in the afternoon.  She and Carrie draped the mantelpiece in the\r\ndrawing-room, and put little toy spiders, frogs and beetles all over it,\r\nas Mrs. James says it\xe2\x80\x99s quite the fashion.  It was Mrs. James\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsuggestion, and of course Carrie always does what Mrs. James suggests.\r\nFor my part, I preferred the mantelpiece as it was; but there, I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nplain man, and don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be in the fashion.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 19.\xe2\x80\x94Our next-door neighbour, Mr. Griffin, called, and in a rather\r\noffensive tone accused me, or \xe2\x80\x9csomeone,\xe2\x80\x9d of boring a hole in his cistern\r\nand letting out his water to supply our cistern, which adjoined his.  He\r\nsaid he should have his repaired, and send us in the bill.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 20.\xe2\x80\x94Cummings called, hobbling in with a stick, saying he had been\r\non his back for a week.  It appears he was trying to shut his bedroom\r\ndoor, which is situated just at the top of the staircase, and unknown to\r\nhim a piece of cork the dog had been playing with had got between the\r\ndoor, and prevented it shutting; and in pulling the door hard, to give it\r\nan extra slam, the handle came off in his hands, and he fell backwards\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Lupin suddenly jumped up from the couch and rushed out\r\nof the room sideways.  Cummings looked very indignant, and remarked it\r\nwas very poor fun a man nearly breaking his back; and though I had my\r\nsuspicions that Lupin was laughing, I assured Cummings that he had only\r\nrun out to open the door to a friend he expected.  Cummings said this was\r\nthe second time he had been laid up, and we had never sent to inquire.  I\r\nsaid I knew nothing about it.  Cummings said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was mentioned in the\r\n_Bicycle News_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAPRIL 22.\xe2\x80\x94I have of late frequently noticed Carrie rubbing her nails a\r\ngood deal with an instrument, and on asking her what she was doing, she\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going in for manicuring.  It\xe2\x80\x99s all the fashion now.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Mrs. James introduced that into your head.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie\r\nlaughingly replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes; but everyone does it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wish Mrs. James wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the house.  Whenever she does she\r\nalways introduces some new-fandangled rubbish into Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s head.  One of\r\nthese days I feel sure I shall tell her she\xe2\x80\x99s not welcome.  I am sure it\r\nwas Mrs. James who put Carrie up to writing on dark slate-coloured paper\r\nwith white ink.  Nonsense!\r\n\r\nAPRIL 23.\xe2\x80\x94Received a letter from Mrs. Lupkin, of Southend, telling us the\r\ntrain to come by on Saturday, and hoping we will keep our promise to stay\r\nwith her.  The letter concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must come and stay at our house; we\r\nshall charge you half what you will have to pay at the Royal, and the\r\nview is every bit as good.\xe2\x80\x9d  Looking at the address at the top of the\r\nnote-paper, I found it was \xe2\x80\x9cLupkin\xe2\x80\x99s Family and Commercial Hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wrote a note, saying we were compelled to \xe2\x80\x9cdecline her kind\r\ninvitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie thought this very satirical, and to the point.\r\n\r\nBy-the-by, I will never choose another cloth pattern at night.  I ordered\r\na new suit of dittos for the garden at Edwards\xe2\x80\x99, and chose the pattern by\r\ngaslight, and they seemed to be a quiet pepper-and-salt mixture with\r\nwhite stripes down.  They came home this morning, and, to my horror, I\r\nfound it was quite a flash-looking suit.  There was a lot of green with\r\nbright yellow-coloured stripes.\r\n\r\nI tried on the coat, and was annoyed to find Carrie giggling.  She said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mixture did you say you asked for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cA quiet pepper and salt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it looks more like mustard, if you want to know the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nMeet Teddy Finsworth, an old schoolfellow.  We have a pleasant and quiet\r\ndinner at his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, marred only by a few awkward mistakes on my part\r\nrespecting Mr. Finsworth\xe2\x80\x99s pictures.  A discussion on dreams.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27.\xe2\x80\x94Kept a little later than usual at the office, and as I was\r\nhurrying along a man stopped me, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cHulloh!  That\xe2\x80\x99s a face I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI replied politely: \xe2\x80\x9cVery likely; lots of people know me, although I may\r\nnot know them.\xe2\x80\x9d  He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBut you know me\xe2\x80\x94Teddy Finsworth.\xe2\x80\x9d  So it\r\nwas.  He was at the same school with me.  I had not seen him for years\r\nand years.  No wonder I did not know him!  At school he was at least a\r\nhead taller than I was; now I am at least a head taller than he is, and\r\nhe has a thick beard, almost grey.  He insisted on my having a glass of\r\nwine (a thing I never do), and told me he lived at Middlesboro\xe2\x80\x99, where he\r\nwas Deputy Town Clerk, a position which was as high as the Town Clerk of\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94in fact, higher.  He added that he was staying for a few days in\r\nLondon, with his uncle, Mr. Edgar Paul Finsworth (of Finsworth and\r\nPultwell).  He said he was sure his uncle would be only too pleased to\r\nsee me, and he had a nice house, Watney Lodge, only a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk\r\nfrom Muswell Hill Station.  I gave him our address, and we parted.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, to my surprise, he called with a very nice letter from\r\nMr. Finsworth, saying if we (including Carrie) would dine with them\r\nto-morrow (Sunday), at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he would be delighted.  Carrie did\r\nnot like to go; but Teddy Finsworth pressed us so much we consented.\r\nCarrie sent Sarah round to the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s and countermanded our half-leg\r\nof mutton, which we had ordered for to-morrow.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 28, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94We found Watney Lodge farther off than we anticipated,\r\nand only arrived as the clock struck two, both feeling hot and\r\nuncomfortable.  To make matters worse, a large collie dog pounced forward\r\nto receive us.  He barked loudly and jumped up at Carrie, covering her\r\nlight skirt, which she was wearing for the first time, with mud.  Teddy\r\nFinsworth came out and drove the dog off and apologised.  We were shown\r\ninto the drawing-room, which was beautifully decorated.  It was full of\r\nknick-knacks, and some plates hung up on the wall.  There were several\r\nlittle wooden milk-stools with paintings on them; also a white wooden\r\nbanjo, painted by one of Mr. Paul Finsworth\xe2\x80\x99s nieces\xe2\x80\x94a cousin of Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nMr. Paul Finsworth seemed quite a distinguished-looking elderly\r\ngentleman, and was most gallant to Carrie.  There were a great many\r\nwater-colours hanging on the walls, mostly different views of India,\r\nwhich were very bright.  Mr. Finsworth said they were painted by \xe2\x80\x9cSimpz,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand added that he was no judge of pictures himself but had been informed\r\non good authority that they were worth some hundreds of pounds, although\r\nhe had only paid a few shillings apiece for them, frames included, at a\r\nsale in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThere was also a large picture in a very handsome frame, done in coloured\r\ncrayons.  It looked like a religious subject.  I was very much struck\r\nwith the lace collar, it looked so real, but I unfortunately made the\r\nremark that there was something about the expression of the face that was\r\nnot quite pleasing.  It looked pinched.  Mr. Finsworth sorrowfully\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the face was done after death\xe2\x80\x94my wife\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt terribly awkward and bowed apologetically, and in a whisper said I\r\nhoped I had not hurt his feelings.  We both stood looking at the picture\r\nfor a few minutes in silence, when Mr. Finsworth took out a handkerchief\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cShe was sitting in our garden last summer,\xe2\x80\x9d and blew his nose\r\nviolently.  He seemed quite affected, so I turned to look at something\r\nelse and stood in front of a portrait of a jolly-looking middle-aged\r\ngentleman, with a red face and straw hat.  I said to Mr. Finsworth: \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nis this jovial-looking gentleman?  Life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to trouble him\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Finsworth said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.  _He is dead too_\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was absolutely horrified at my own awkwardness.  Fortunately at this\r\nmoment Carrie entered with Mrs. Finsworth, who had taken her upstairs to\r\ntake off her bonnet and brush her skirt.  Teddy said: \xe2\x80\x9cShort is late,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut at that moment the gentleman referred to arrived, and I was\r\nintroduced to him by Teddy, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Mr. Short?\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\nreplied, smiling, that I had not that pleasure, but I hoped it would not\r\nbe long before I knew Mr. _Short_.  He evidently did not see my little\r\njoke, although I repeated it twice with a little laugh.  I suddenly\r\nremembered it was Sunday, and Mr. Short was perhaps _very particular_.\r\nIn this I was mistaken, for he was not at all particular in several of\r\nhis remarks after dinner.  In fact I was so ashamed of one of his\r\nobservations that I took the opportunity to say to Mrs. Finsworth that I\r\nfeared she found Mr. Short occasionally a little embarrassing.  To my\r\nsurprise she said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! he is privileged you know.\xe2\x80\x9d  I did not know as a\r\nmatter of fact, and so I bowed apologetically.  I fail to see why Mr.\r\nShort should be privileged.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that annoyed me at dinner was that the collie dog, which\r\njumped up at Carrie, was allowed to remain under the dining-room table.\r\nIt kept growling and snapping at my boots every time I moved my foot.\r\nFeeling nervous rather, I spoke to Mrs. Finsworth about the animal, and\r\nshe remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only his play.\xe2\x80\x9d  She jumped up and let in a\r\nfrightfully ugly-looking spaniel called Bibbs, which had been scratching\r\nat the door.  This dog also seemed to take a fancy to my boots, and I\r\ndiscovered afterwards that it had licked off every bit of blacking from\r\nthem.  I was positively ashamed of being seen in them.  Mrs. Finsworth,\r\nwho, I must say, is not much of a Job\xe2\x80\x99s comforter, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! we are used\r\nto Bibbs doing that to our visitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Finsworth had up some fine port, although I question whether it is a\r\ngood thing to take on the top of beer.  It made me feel a little sleepy,\r\nwhile it had the effect of inducing Mr. Short to become \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nrather an alarming extent.  It being cold even for April, there was a\r\nfire in the drawing-room; we sat round in easy-chairs, and Teddy and I\r\nwaxed rather eloquent over the old school days, which had the effect of\r\nsending all the others to sleep.  I was delighted, as far as Mr. Short\r\nwas concerned, that it did have that effect on him.\r\n\r\nWe stayed till four, and the walk home was remarkable only for the fact\r\nthat several fools giggled at the unpolished state of my boots.  Polished\r\nthem myself when I got home.  Went to church in the evening, and could\r\nscarcely keep awake.  I will not take port on the top of beer again.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 29.\xe2\x80\x94I am getting quite accustomed to being snubbed by Lupin, and I\r\ndo not mind being sat upon by Carrie, because I think she has a certain\r\namount of right to do so; but I do think it hard to be at once snubbed by\r\nwife, son, and both my guests.\r\n\r\nGowing and Cummings had dropped in during the evening, and I suddenly\r\nremembered an extraordinary dream I had a few nights ago, and I thought I\r\nwould tell them about it.  I dreamt I saw some huge blocks of ice in a\r\nshop with a bright glare behind them.  I walked into the shop and the\r\nheat was overpowering.  I found that the blocks of ice were on fire.  The\r\nwhole thing was so real and yet so supernatural I woke up in a cold\r\nperspiration.  Lupin in a most contemptuous manner, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat utter\r\nrot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply, Gowing said there was nothing so completely\r\nuninteresting as other people\xe2\x80\x99s dreams.\r\n\r\nI appealed to Cummings, but he said he was bound to agree with the others\r\nand my dream was especially nonsensical.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed so real to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gowing replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, to _you_ perhaps, but not to _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhereupon they all roared.\r\n\r\nCarrie, who had hitherto been quiet, said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe tells me his stupid dreams\r\nevery morning nearly.\xe2\x80\x9d  I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, dear, I promise you I will\r\nnever tell you or anybody else another dream of mine the longest day I\r\nlive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cHear! hear!\xe2\x80\x9d and helped himself to another glass of\r\nbeer.  The subject was fortunately changed, and Cummings read a most\r\ninteresting article on the superiority of the bicycle to the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nDinner at Franching\xe2\x80\x99s to meet Mr. Hardfur Huttle.\r\n\r\nMAY 10.\xe2\x80\x94Received a letter from Mr. Franching, of Peckham, asking us to\r\ndine with him to-night, at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, to meet Mr. Hardfur Huttle, a\r\nvery clever writer for the American papers.  Franching apologised for the\r\nshort notice; but said he had at the last moment been disappointed of two\r\nof his guests and regarded us as old friends who would not mind filling\r\nup the gap.  Carrie rather demurred at the invitation; but I explained to\r\nher that Franching was very well off and influential, and we could not\r\nafford to offend him.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are sure to get a good dinner and a good\r\nglass of champagne.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWhich never agrees with you!\xe2\x80\x9d Carrie replied,\r\nsharply.  I regarded Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s observation as unsaid.  Mr. Franching asked\r\nus to wire a reply.  As he had said nothing about dress in the letter, I\r\nwired back: \xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure.  Is it full dress?\xe2\x80\x9d and by leaving out our\r\nname, just got the message within the sixpence.\r\n\r\nGot back early to give time to dress, which we received a telegram\r\ninstructing us to do.  I wanted Carrie to meet me at Franching\xe2\x80\x99s house;\r\nbut she would not do so, so I had to go home to fetch her.  What a long\r\njourney it is from Holloway to Peckham!  Why do people live such a long\r\nway off?  Having to change \xe2\x80\x99buses, I allowed plenty of time\xe2\x80\x94in fact, too\r\nmuch; for we arrived at twenty minutes to seven, and Franching, so the\r\nservant said, had only just gone up to dress.  However, he was down as\r\nthe clock struck seven; he must have dressed very quickly.\r\n\r\nI must say it was quite a distinguished party, and although we did not\r\nknow anybody personally, they all seemed to be quite swells.  Franching\r\nhad got a professional waiter, and evidently spared no expense.  There\r\nwere flowers on the table round some fairy-lamps and the effect, I must\r\nsay, was exquisite.  The wine was good and there was plenty of champagne,\r\nconcerning which Franching said he himself, never wished to taste better.\r\nWe were ten in number, and a _men\xc3\xbb_ card to each.  One lady said she\r\nalways preserved the _men\xc3\xbb_ and got the guests to write their names on\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\nWe all of us followed her example, except Mr. Huttle, who was of course\r\nthe important guest.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party consisted of Mr. Franching, Mr. Hardfur Huttle, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Samuel Hillbutter, Mrs. Field, Mr. and Mrs. Purdick, Mr. Pratt, Mr.\r\nR. Kent, and, last but not least, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pooter.  Franching\r\nsaid he was sorry he had no lady for me to take in to dinner.  I replied\r\nthat I preferred it, which I afterwards thought was a very\r\nuncomplimentary observation to make.\r\n\r\nI sat next to Mrs. Field at dinner.  She seemed a well-informed lady, but\r\nwas very deaf.  It did not much matter, for Mr. Hardfur Huttle did all\r\nthe talking.  He is a marvellously intellectual man and says things which\r\nfrom other people would seem quite alarming.  How I wish I could remember\r\neven a quarter of his brilliant conversation.  I made a few little\r\nreminding notes on the _men\xc3\xbb_ card.\r\n\r\nOne observation struck me as being absolutely powerful\xe2\x80\x94though not to my\r\nway of thinking of course.  Mrs. Purdick happened to say \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\ncertainly unorthodox, Mr. Huttle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Huttle, with a peculiar\r\nexpression (I can see it now) said in a slow rich voice: \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Purdick,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98orthodox\xe2\x80\x99 is a grandiloquent word implying sticking-in-the-mud.  If\r\nColumbus and Stephenson had been orthodox, there would neither have been\r\nthe discovery of America nor the steam-engine.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was quite a\r\nsilence.  It appeared to me that such teaching was absolutely dangerous,\r\nand yet I felt\xe2\x80\x94in fact we must all have felt\xe2\x80\x94there was no answer to the\r\nargument.  A little later on, Mrs. Purdick, who is Franching\xe2\x80\x99s sister and\r\nalso acted as hostess, rose from the table, and Mr. Huttle said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nladies, do you deprive us of your company so soon?  Why not wait while we\r\nhave our cigars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effect was electrical.  The ladies (including Carrie) were in no way\r\ninclined to be deprived of Mr. Huttle\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating society, and\r\nimmediately resumed their seats, amid much laughter and a little chaff.\r\nMr. Huttle said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s a real good sign; you shall not be\r\ninsulted by being called orthodox any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mrs. Purdick, who seemed\r\nto be a bright and rather sharp woman, said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Huttle, we will meet\r\nyou half-way\xe2\x80\x94that is, till you get half-way through your cigar.  That, at\r\nall events, will be the happy medium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the effect the words, \xe2\x80\x9chappy medium,\xe2\x80\x9d had upon him.\r\nHe was brilliant and most daring in his interpretation of the words.  He\r\npositively alarmed me.  He said something like the following: \xe2\x80\x9cHappy\r\nmedium, indeed.  Do you know \xe2\x80\x98happy medium\xe2\x80\x99 are two words which mean\r\n\xe2\x80\x98miserable mediocrity\xe2\x80\x99?  I say, go first class or third; marry a duchess\r\nor her kitchenmaid.  The happy medium means respectability, and\r\nrespectability means insipidness.  Does it not, Mr. Pooter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so taken aback by being personally appealed to, that I could only\r\nbow apologetically, and say I feared I was not competent to offer an\r\nopinion.  Carrie was about to say something; but she was interrupted, for\r\nwhich I was rather pleased, for she is not clever at argument, and one\r\nhas to be extra clever to discuss a subject with a man like Mr. Huttle.\r\n\r\nHe continued, with an amazing eloquence that made his unwelcome opinions\r\npositively convincing: \xe2\x80\x9cThe happy medium is nothing more or less than a\r\nvulgar half-measure.  A man who loves champagne and, finding a pint too\r\nlittle, fears to face a whole bottle and has recourse to an imperial\r\npint, will never build a Brooklyn Bridge or an Eiffel Tower.  No, he is\r\nhalf-hearted, he is a half-measure\xe2\x80\x94respectable\xe2\x80\x94in fact, a happy medium,\r\nand will spend the rest of his days in a suburban villa with a\r\nstucco-column portico, resembling a four-post bedstead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sort of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Huttle, \xe2\x80\x9cbelongs to a soft man, with\r\na soft beard with a soft head, with a made tie that hooks on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed rather personal and twice I caught myself looking in the\r\nglass of the cheffoni\xc3\xa8re; for _I_ had on a tie that hooked on\xe2\x80\x94and why\r\nnot?  If these remarks were not personal they were rather careless, and\r\nso were some of his subsequent observations, which must have made both\r\nMr. Franching and his guests rather uncomfortable.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr.\r\nHuttle meant to be personal, for he added; \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know that class here\r\nin this country: but we do in America, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve no use for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFranching several times suggested that the wine should be passed round\r\nthe table, which Mr. Huttle did not heed; but continued as if he were\r\ngiving a lecture:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we want in America is your homes.  We live on wheels.  Your simple,\r\nquiet life and home, Mr. Franching, are charming.  No display, no\r\npretension!  You make no difference in your dinner, I dare say, when you\r\nsit down by yourself and when you invite us.  You have your own personal\r\nattendant\xe2\x80\x94no hired waiter to breathe on the back of your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw Franching palpably wince at this.\r\n\r\nMr. Huttle continued: \xe2\x80\x9cJust a small dinner with a few good things, such\r\nas you have this evening.   You don\xe2\x80\x99t insult your guests by sending to\r\nthe grocer for champagne at six shillings a bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking of \xe2\x80\x9cJackson Fr\xc3\xa8res\xe2\x80\x9d at three-and-six!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Huttle, \xe2\x80\x9ca man is little less than a murderer who\r\ndoes.  That is the province of the milksop, who wastes his evening at\r\nhome playing dominoes with his wife.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of these people.  We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want them at this table.  Our party is well selected.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve no use\r\nfor deaf old women, who cannot follow intellectual conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll our eyes were turned to Mrs. Field, who fortunately, being deaf, did\r\nnot hear his remarks; but continued smiling approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no representative at Mr. Franching\xe2\x80\x99s table,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Huttle,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cof the unenlightened frivolous matron, who goes to a second class dance\r\nat Bayswater and fancies she is in Society.  Society does not know her;\r\nit has no use for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Huttle paused for a moment and the opportunity was afforded for the\r\nladies to rise.  I asked Mr. Franching quietly to excuse me, as I did not\r\nwish to miss the last train, which we very nearly did, by-the-by, through\r\nCarrie having mislaid the little cloth cricket-cap which she wears when\r\nwe go out.\r\n\r\nIt was very late when Carrie and I got home; but on entering the\r\nsitting-room I said: \xe2\x80\x9cCarrie, what do you think of Mr. Hardfur Huttle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe simply answered: \xe2\x80\x9cHow like Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d  The same idea occurred to me in\r\nthe train.  The comparison kept me awake half the night.  Mr. Huttle was,\r\nof course, an older and more influential man; but he _was_ like Lupin,\r\nand it made me think how dangerous Lupin would be if he were older and\r\nmore influential.  I feel proud to think Lupin _does_ resemble Mr. Huttle\r\nin some ways.  Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has original and sometimes\r\nwonderful ideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous.  They make\r\nmen extremely rich or extremely poor.  They make or break men.  I always\r\nfeel people are happier who live a simple unsophisticated life.  I\r\nbelieve _I_ am happy because I am not ambitious.  Somehow I feel that\r\nLupin, since he has been with Mr. Perkupp, has become content to settle\r\ndown and follow the footsteps of his father.  This is a comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nLupin is discharged.  We are in great trouble.  Lupin gets engaged\r\nelsewhere at a handsome salary.\r\n\r\nMAY 13.\xe2\x80\x94A terrible misfortune has happened: Lupin is discharged from Mr.\r\nPerkupp\xe2\x80\x99s office; and I scarcely know how I am writing my diary.  I was\r\naway from office last Sat., the first time I have been absent through\r\nillness for twenty years.  I believe I was poisoned by some lobster.  Mr.\r\nPerkupp was also absent, as Fate would have it; and our most valued\r\ncustomer, Mr. Crowbillon, went to the office in a rage, and withdrew his\r\ncustom.  My boy Lupin not only had the assurance to receive him, but\r\nrecommended him the firm of Gylterson, Sons and Co. Limited.  In my own\r\nhumble judgment, and though I have to say it against my own son, this\r\nseems an act of treachery.\r\n\r\nThis morning I receive a letter from Perkupp, informing me that Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservices are no longer required, and an interview with me is desired at\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.  I went down to the office with an aching heart, dreading\r\nan interview with Mr. Perkupp, with whom I have never had a word.  I saw\r\nnothing of Lupin in the morning.  He had not got up when it was time for\r\nme to leave, and Carrie said I should do no good by disturbing him.  My\r\nmind wandered so at the office that I could not do my work properly.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, and the following\r\nconversation ensued as nearly as I can remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkupp said: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Mr. Pooter!  This is a very serious\r\nbusiness.  I am not referring so much to the dismissal of your son, for I\r\nknew we should have to part sooner or later.  _I_ am the head of this\r\nold, influential, and much-respected firm; and when _I_ consider the time\r\nhas come to revolutionise the business, _I_ will do it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see my good master was somewhat affected, and I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\r\nsir, you do not imagine that I have in any way countenanced my son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunwarrantable interference?\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Perkupp rose from his seat and took my\r\nhand, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pooter, I would as soon suspect myself as suspect\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d  I was so agitated that in the confusion, to show my gratitude I\r\nvery nearly called him a \xe2\x80\x9cgrand old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortunately I checked myself in time, and said he was a \xe2\x80\x9cgrand old\r\nmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d  I was so unaccountable for my actions that I sat down, leaving\r\nhim standing.  Of course, I at once rose, but Mr. Perkupp bade me sit\r\ndown, which I was very pleased to do.  Mr. Perkupp, resuming, said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwill understand, Mr. Pooter, that the high-standing nature of our firm\r\nwill not admit of our bending to anybody.  If Mr. Crowbillon chooses to\r\nput his work into other hands\xe2\x80\x94I may add, less experienced hands\xe2\x80\x94it is not\r\nfor us to bend and beg back his custom.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cYou _shall_ not do it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid with indignation.  \xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Perkupp; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall _not_ do\r\nit.  But I was thinking this, Mr. Pooter.  Mr. Crowbillon is our most\r\nvalued client, and I will even confess\xe2\x80\x94for I know this will not go beyond\r\nourselves\xe2\x80\x94that we cannot afford very well to lose him, especially in\r\nthese times, which are not of the brightest.  Now, I fancy you can be of\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Perkupp, I will work day and night to serve you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Perkupp said: \xe2\x80\x9cI know you will.  Now, what I should like you to do is\r\nthis.  You yourself might write to Mr. Crowbillon\xe2\x80\x94you must not, of\r\ncourse, lead him to suppose I know anything about your doing so\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nexplain to him that your son was only taken on as a clerk\xe2\x80\x94quite an\r\ninexperienced one in fact\xe2\x80\x94out of the respect the firm had for you, Mr.\r\nPooter.  This is, of course, a fact.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t suggest that you should\r\nspeak in too strong terms of your own son\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; but I may add, that\r\nhad he been a son of mine, I should have condemned his interference with\r\nno measured terms.  That I leave to you.  I think the result will be that\r\nMr. Crowbillon will see the force of the foolish step he has taken, and\r\nour firm will neither suffer in dignity nor in pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking what a noble gentleman Mr. Perkupp is.  His\r\nmanners and his way of speaking seem to almost thrill one with respect.\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to see the letter before I send it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Perkupp said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh no!  I had better not.  I am supposed to know\r\nnothing about it, and I have every confidence in you.  You must write the\r\nletter carefully.  We are not very busy; you had better take the morning\r\nto-morrow, or the whole day if you like.  I shall be here myself all day\r\nto-morrow, in fact all the week, in case Mr. Crowbillon should call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went home a little more cheerful, but I left word with Sarah that I\r\ncould not see either Gowing or Cummings, nor in fact anybody, if they\r\ncalled in the evening.  Lupin came into the parlour for a moment with a\r\nnew hat on, and asked my opinion of it.  I said I was not in the mood to\r\njudge of hats, and I did not think he was in a position to buy a new one.\r\nLupin replied carelessly: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it; it was a present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have such terrible suspicions of Lupin now that I scarcely like to ask\r\nhim questions, as I dread the answers so.  He, however, saved me the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cI met a friend, an old friend, that I did not quite think a\r\nfriend at the time; but it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.  As he wisely said, \xe2\x80\x98all is fair\r\nin love and war,\xe2\x80\x99 and there was no reason why we should not be friends\r\nstill.  He\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly, good, all-round sort of fellow, and a very\r\ndifferent stamp from that inflated fool of a Perkupp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cHush, Lupin!  Do not pray add insult to injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by injury?  I repeat, I have done no\r\ninjury.  Crowbillon is simply tired of a stagnant stick-in-the-mud firm,\r\nand made the change on his own account.  I simply recommended the new\r\nfirm as a matter of biz\xe2\x80\x94good old biz!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your slang, and at my time of life\r\nhave no desire to learn it; so, Lupin, my boy, let us change the subject.\r\nI will, if it please you, _try_ and be interested in your new hat\r\nadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing much about it, except I have not once\r\nseen him since his marriage, and he said he was very pleased to see me,\r\nand hoped we should be friends.  I stood a drink to cement the\r\nfriendship, and he stood me a new hat\xe2\x80\x94one of his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said rather wearily: \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have not told me your old friend\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said, with affected carelessness: \xe2\x80\x9cOh didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?  Well, I will.  It\r\nwas _Murray Posh_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMAY 14.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin came down late, and seeing me at home all the morning,\r\nasked the reason of it.  Carrie and I both agreed it was better to say\r\nnothing to him about the letter I was writing, so I evaded the question.\r\n\r\nLupin went out, saying he was going to lunch with Murray Posh in the\r\nCity.  I said I hoped Mr. Posh would provide him with a berth.  Lupin\r\nwent out laughing, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind _wearing_ Posh\xe2\x80\x99s one-priced\r\nhats, but I am not going to _sell_ them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Poor boy, I fear he is\r\nperfectly hopeless.\r\n\r\nIt took me nearly the whole day to write to Mr. Crowbillon.  Once or\r\ntwice I asked Carrie for suggestions; and although it seems ungrateful,\r\nher suggestions were none of them to the point, while one or two were\r\nabsolutely idiotic.  Of course I did not tell her so.  I got the letter\r\noff, and took it down to the office for Mr. Perkupp to see, but he again\r\nrepeated that he could trust me.\r\n\r\nGowing called in the evening, and I was obliged to tell him about Lupin\r\nand Mr. Perkupp; and, to my surprise, he was quite inclined to side with\r\nLupin.  Carrie joined in, and said she thought I was taking much too\r\nmelancholy a view of it.  Gowing produced a pint sample-bottle of\r\nMadeira, which had been given him, which he said would get rid of the\r\nblues.  I dare say it would have done so if there had been more of it;\r\nbut as Gowing helped himself to three glasses, it did not leave much for\r\nCarrie and me to get rid of the blues with.\r\n\r\nMAY 15.\xe2\x80\x94A day of great anxiety, for I expected every moment a letter from\r\nMr. Crowbillon.  Two letters came in the evening\xe2\x80\x94one for me, with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrowbillon Hall\xe2\x80\x9d printed in large gold-and-red letters on the back of\r\nthe envelope; the other for Lupin, which I felt inclined to open and\r\nread, as it had \xe2\x80\x9cGylterson, Sons, and Co. Limited,\xe2\x80\x9d which was the\r\nrecommended firm.  I trembled as I opened Mr. Crowbillon\xe2\x80\x99s letter.  I\r\nwrote him sixteen pages, closely written; he wrote me less than sixteen\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nHis letter was: \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x94I totally disagree with you.  Your son, in the\r\ncourse of five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 conversation, displayed more intelligence than\r\nyour firm has done during the last five years.\xe2\x80\x94Yours faithfully, Gilbert\r\nE. Gillam O. Crowbillon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat am I to do?  Here is a letter that I dare not show to Mr. Perkupp,\r\nand would not show to Lupin for anything.  The crisis had yet to come;\r\nfor Lupin arrived, and, opening his letter, showed a cheque for \xc2\xa325 as a\r\ncommission for the recommendation of Mr. Crowbillon, whose custom to Mr.\r\nPerkupp is evidently lost for ever.  Cummings and Gowing both called, and\r\nboth took Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s part.  Cummings went so far as to say that Lupin would\r\nmake a name yet.  I suppose I was melancholy, for I could only ask: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nbut what sort of a name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMAY 16.\xe2\x80\x94I told Mr. Perkupp the contents of the letter in a modified form,\r\nbut Mr. Perkupp said: \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss the matter; it is at an end.\r\nYour son will bring his punishment upon himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  I went home in the\r\nevening, thinking of the hopeless future of Lupin.  I found him in most\r\nextravagant spirits and in evening dress.  He threw a letter on the table\r\nfor me to read.\r\n\r\nTo my amazement, I read that Gylterson and Sons had absolutely engaged\r\nLupin at a salary of \xc2\xa3200 a year, with other advantages.  I read the\r\nletter through three times and thought it must have been for me.  But\r\nthere it was\xe2\x80\x94Lupin Pooter\xe2\x80\x94plain enough.  I was silent.  Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nprice Perkupp now?  You take my tip, Guv.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 with Perkupp and freeze\r\non to Gylterson, the firm of the future!  Perkupp\xe2\x80\x99s firm?  The stagnant\r\ndummies have been standing still for years, and now are moving back.  I\r\nwant to go on.  In fact I must go _off_, as I am dining with the Murray\r\nPoshs to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the exuberance of his spirits he hit his hat with his stick, gave a\r\nloud war \xe2\x80\x9cWhoo-oop,\xe2\x80\x9d jumped over a chair, and took the liberty of\r\nrumpling my hair all over my forehead, and bounced out of the room,\r\ngiving me no chance of reminding him of his age and the respect which was\r\ndue to his parent.  Gowing and Cummings came in the evening, and\r\npositively cheered me up with congratulations respecting Lupin.\r\n\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cI always said he would get on, and, take my word, he has\r\nmore in his head than we three put together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a second Hardfur Huttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Percy Edgar Smith James.  Mrs. James (of Sutton) visits us again\r\nand introduces \xe2\x80\x9cSpiritual S\xc3\xa9ances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMAY 26, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94We went to Sutton after dinner to have meat-tea with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. James.  I had no appetite, having dined well at two, and the\r\nentire evening was spoiled by little Percy\xe2\x80\x94their only son\xe2\x80\x94who seems to me\r\nto be an utterly spoiled child.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times he came up to me and deliberately kicked my shins.  He\r\nhurt me once so much that the tears came into my eyes.  I gently\r\nremonstrated with him, and Mrs. James said: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t scold him; I do\r\nnot believe in being too severe with young children.  You spoil their\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Percy set up a deafening yell here, and when Carrie tried to\r\npacify him, he slapped her face.\r\n\r\nI was so annoyed, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not my idea of bringing up children,\r\nMrs. James.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. James said.  \xe2\x80\x9cPeople have different ideas of bringing up\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94even your son Lupin is not the standard of perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Mr. Mezzini (an Italian, I fancy) here took Percy in his lap.  The\r\nchild wriggled and kicked and broke away from Mr. Mezzini, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a dirty face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA very nice gentleman, Mr. Birks Spooner, took the child by the wrist and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, dear, and listen to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe detached his chronometer from the chain and made his watch strike six.\r\n\r\nTo our horror, the child snatched it from his hand and bounced it down\r\nupon the ground like one would a ball.\r\n\r\nMr. Birks Spooner was most amiable, and said he could easily get a new\r\nglass put in, and did not suppose the works were damaged.\r\n\r\nTo show you how people\xe2\x80\x99s opinions differ, Carrie said the child was\r\nbad-tempered, but it made up for that defect by its looks, for it was\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nher mind\xe2\x80\x94an unquestionably beautiful child.\r\n\r\nI may be wrong, but I do not think I have seen a much uglier child\r\nmyself.  That is _my_ opinion.\r\n\r\nMAY 30.\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it is, but I never anticipate with any pleasure\r\nthe visits to our house of Mrs. James, of Sutton.  She is coming again to\r\nstay for a few days.  I said to Carrie this morning, as I was leaving: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish, dear Carrie, I could like Mrs. James better than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie said: \xe2\x80\x9cSo do I, dear; but as for years I have had to put up with\r\nMr. Gowing, who is vulgar, and Mr. Cummings, who is kind but most\r\nuninteresting, I am sure, dear, you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind the occasional visits of\r\nMrs. James, who has more intellect in her little finger than both your\r\nfriends have in their entire bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so entirely taken back by this onslaught on my two dear old\r\nfriends, I could say nothing, and as I heard the \xe2\x80\x99bus coming, I left with\r\na hurried kiss\xe2\x80\x94a little too hurried, perhaps, for my upper lip came in\r\ncontact with Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s teeth and slightly cut it.  It was quite painful\r\nfor an hour afterwards.  When I came home in the evening I found Carrie\r\nburied in a book on Spiritualism, called _There is no Birth_, by Florence\r\nSingleyet.  I need scarcely say the book was sent her to read by Mrs.\r\nJames, of Sutton.  As she had not a word to say outside her book, I spent\r\nthe rest of the evening altering the stair-carpets, which are beginning\r\nto show signs of wear at the edges.\r\n\r\nMrs. James arrived and, as usual, in the evening took the entire\r\nmanagement of everything.  Finding that she and Carrie were making some\r\npreparations for table-turning, I thought it time really to put my foot\r\ndown.  I have always had the greatest contempt for such nonsense, and put\r\nan end to it years ago when Carrie, at our old house, used to have\r\ns\xc3\xa9ances every night with poor Mrs. Fussters (who is now dead).  If I\r\ncould see any use in it, I would not care.  As I stopped it in the days\r\ngone by, I determined to do so now.\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry Mrs. James, but I totally disapprove of it,\r\napart from the fact that I receive my old friends on this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. James said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read _There is no\r\nBirth_?\xe2\x80\x9d  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, and I have no intention of doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mrs. James\r\nseemed surprised and said: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the world is going mad over the book.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\nresponded rather cleverly: \xe2\x80\x9cLet it.  There will be one sane man in it, at\r\nall events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. James said she thought it was very unkind, and if people were all as\r\nprejudiced as I was, there would never have been the electric telegraph\r\nor the telephone.\r\n\r\nI said that was quite a different thing.\r\n\r\nMrs. James said sharply: \xe2\x80\x9cIn what way, pray\xe2\x80\x94in what way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn many ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. James said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, mention _one_ way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Mrs. James; I decline to discuss the\r\nmatter.  I am not interested in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSarah at this moment opened the door and showed in Cummings, for which I\r\nwas thankful, for I felt it would put a stop to this foolish\r\ntable-turning.  But I was entirely mistaken; for, on the subject being\r\nopened again, Cummings said he was most interested in Spiritualism,\r\nalthough he was bound to confess he did not believe much in it; still, he\r\nwas willing to be convinced.\r\n\r\nI firmly declined to take any part in it, with the result that my\r\npresence was ignored.  I left the three sitting in the parlour at a small\r\nround table which they had taken out of the drawing-room.  I walked into\r\nthe hall with the ultimate intention of taking a little stroll.  As I\r\nopened the door, who should come in but Gowing!\r\n\r\nOn hearing what was going on, he proposed that we should join the circle\r\nand he would go into a trance.  He added that he _knew_ a few things\r\nabout old Cummings, and would _invent_ a few about Mrs. James.  Knowing\r\nhow dangerous Gowing is, I declined to let him take part in any such\r\nfoolish performance.  Sarah asked me if she could go out for half an\r\nhour, and I gave her permission, thinking it would be more comfortable to\r\nsit with Gowing in the kitchen than in the cold drawing-room.  We talked\r\na good deal about Lupin and Mr. and Mrs. Murray Posh, with whom he is as\r\nusual spending the evening.  Gowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad\r\nthing for Lupin if old Posh kicked the bucket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart gave a leap of horror, and I rebuked Gowing very sternly for\r\njoking on such a subject.  I lay awake half the night thinking of it\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nother half was spent in nightmares on the same subject.\r\n\r\nMAY 31.\xe2\x80\x94I wrote a stern letter to the laundress.  I was rather pleased\r\nwith the letter, for I thought it very satirical.  I said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nreturned the handkerchiefs without the colour.  Perhaps you will return\r\neither the colour or the value of the handkerchiefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  I shall be rather\r\ncurious to know what she will have to say.\r\n\r\nMore table-turning in the evening.  Carrie said last night was in a\r\nmeasure successful, and they ought to sit again.  Cummings came in, and\r\nseemed interested.  I had the gas lighted in the drawing-room, got the\r\nsteps, and repaired the cornice, which has been a bit of an eyesore to\r\nme.  In a fit of unthinkingness\xe2\x80\x94if I may use such an expression,\xe2\x80\x94I gave\r\nthe floor over the parlour, where the s\xc3\xa9ance was taking place, two loud\r\nraps with the hammer.  I felt sorry afterwards, for it was the sort of\r\nridiculous, foolhardy thing that Gowing or Lupin would have done.\r\n\r\nHowever, they never even referred to it, but Carrie declared that a\r\nmessage came through the table to her of a wonderful description,\r\nconcerning someone whom she and I knew years ago, and who was quite\r\nunknown to the others.\r\n\r\nWhen we went to bed, Carrie asked me as a favour to sit to-morrow night,\r\nto oblige her.  She said it seemed rather unkind and unsociable on my\r\npart.  I promised I would sit once.\r\n\r\nJUNE 1.\xe2\x80\x94I sat reluctantly at the table in the evening, and I am bound to\r\nadmit some curious things happened.  I contend they were coincidences,\r\nbut they were curious.  For instance, the table kept tilting towards me,\r\nwhich Carrie construed as a desire that I should ask the spirit a\r\nquestion.  I obeyed the rules, and I asked the spirit (who said her name\r\nwas Lina) if she could tell me the name of an old aunt of whom I was\r\nthinking, and whom we used to call Aunt Maggie.  The table spelled out C\r\nA T.  We could make nothing out of it, till I suddenly remembered that\r\nher second name was Catherine, which it was evidently trying to spell.  I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think even Carrie knew this.  But if she did, she would never\r\ncheat.  I must admit it was curious.  Several other things happened, and\r\nI consented to sit at another s\xc3\xa9ance on Monday.\r\n\r\nJUNE 3.\xe2\x80\x94The laundress called, and said she was very sorry about the\r\nhandkerchiefs, and returned ninepence.  I said, as the colour was\r\ncompletely washed out and the handkerchiefs quite spoiled, ninepence was\r\nnot enough.  Carrie replied that the two handkerchiefs originally only\r\ncost sixpence, for she remembered buying them at a sale at the Holloway\r\n_Bon March\xc3\xa9_.  In that case, I insisted that threepence should be\r\nreturned to the laundress.  Lupin has gone to stay with the Poshs for a\r\nfew days.  I must say I feel very uncomfortable about it.  Carrie said I\r\nwas ridiculous to worry about it.  Mr. Posh was very fond of Lupin, who,\r\nafter all, was only a mere boy.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had another s\xc3\xa9ance, which, in some respects, was very\r\nremarkable, although the first part of it was a little doubtful.  Gowing\r\ncalled, as well as Cummings, and begged to be allowed to join the circle.\r\nI wanted to object, but Mrs. James, who appears a good Medium (that is,\r\nif there is anything in it at all), thought there might be a little more\r\nspirit power if Gowing joined; so the five of us sat down.\r\n\r\nThe moment I turned out the gas, and almost before I could get my hands\r\non the table, it rocked violently and tilted, and began moving quickly\r\nacross the room.  Gowing shouted out: \xe2\x80\x9cWay oh! steady, lad, steady!\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\ntold Gowing if he could not behave himself I should light the gas, and\r\nput an end to the s\xc3\xa9ance.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I thought Gowing was playing tricks, and I hinted as\r\nmuch; but Mrs. James said she had often seen the table go right off the\r\nground.  The spirit Lina came again, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWARN\xe2\x80\x9d three or four\r\ntimes, and declined to explain.  Mrs. James said \xe2\x80\x9cLina\xe2\x80\x9d was stubborn\r\nsometimes.  She often behaved like that, and the best thing to do was to\r\nsend her away.\r\n\r\nShe then hit the table sharply, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cGo away, Lina; you are\r\ndisagreeable.  Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d  I should think we sat nearly three-quarters of\r\nan hour with nothing happening.  My hands felt quite cold, and I\r\nsuggested we should stop the s\xc3\xa9ance.  Carrie and Mrs. James, as well as\r\nCummings, would not agree to it.  In about ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time there was\r\nsome tilting towards me.  I gave the alphabet, and it spelled out S P O O\r\nF.  As I have heard both Gowing and Lupin use the word, and as I could\r\nhear Gowing silently laughing, I directly accused him of pushing the\r\ntable.  He denied it; but, I regret to say, I did not believe him.\r\n\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it means \xe2\x80\x98Spook,\xe2\x80\x99 a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ know it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything of the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! very well\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I \xe2\x80\x98spook,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and he rose from the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nNo one took any notice of the stupid joke, and Mrs. James suggested he\r\nshould sit out for a while.  Gowing consented and sat in the arm-chair.\r\n\r\nThe table began to move again, and we might have had a wonderful s\xc3\xa9ance\r\nbut for Gowing\xe2\x80\x99s stupid interruptions.  In answer to the alphabet from\r\nCarrie the table spelt \xe2\x80\x9cNIPUL,\xe2\x80\x9d then the \xe2\x80\x9cWARN\xe2\x80\x9d three times.  We could\r\nnot think what it meant till Cummings pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9cNIPUL\xe2\x80\x9d was Lupin\r\nspelled backwards.  This was quite exciting.  Carrie was particularly\r\nexcited, and said she hoped nothing horrible was going to happen.\r\n\r\nMrs. James asked if \xe2\x80\x9cLina\xe2\x80\x9d was the spirit.  The table replied firmly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d and the spirit would not give his or her name.  We then had the\r\nmessage, \xe2\x80\x9cNIPUL will be very rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie said she felt quite relieved, but the word \xe2\x80\x9cWARN\xe2\x80\x9d was again spelt\r\nout.  The table then began to oscillate violently, and in reply to Mrs.\r\nJames, who spoke very softly to the table, the spirit began to spell its\r\nname.  It first spelled \xe2\x80\x9cDRINK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGowing here said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s more in my line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked him to be quiet as the name might not be completed.\r\n\r\nThe table then spelt \xe2\x80\x9cWATER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGowing here interrupted again, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s _not_ in my line.\r\n_Outside_ if you like, but not inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarrie appealed to him to be quiet.\r\n\r\nThe table then spelt \xe2\x80\x9cCAPTAIN,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. James startled us by crying out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Drinkwater, a very old friend of my father\xe2\x80\x99s, who has been dead\r\nsome years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was more interesting, and I could not help thinking that after all\r\nthere must be something in Spiritualism.\r\n\r\nMrs. James asked the spirit to interpret the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cWarn\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas applied to \xe2\x80\x9cNIPUL.\xe2\x80\x9d  The alphabet was given again, and we got the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBOSH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGowing here muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cSo it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. James said she did not think the spirit meant that, as Captain\r\nDrinkwater was a perfect gentleman, and would never have used the word in\r\nanswer to a lady\xe2\x80\x99s question.  Accordingly the alphabet was given again.\r\n\r\nThis time the table spelled distinctly \xe2\x80\x9cPOSH.\xe2\x80\x9d  We all thought of Mrs.\r\nMurray Posh and Lupin.  Carrie was getting a little distressed, and as it\r\nwas getting late we broke up the circle.\r\n\r\nWe arranged to have one more to-morrow, as it will be Mrs. James\xe2\x80\x99 last\r\nnight in town.  We also determined _not_ to have Gowing present.\r\n\r\nCummings, before leaving, said it was certainly interesting, but he\r\nwished the spirits would say something about him.\r\n\r\nJUNE 4.\xe2\x80\x94Quite looking forward to the s\xc3\xa9ance this evening.  Was thinking\r\nof it all the day at the office.\r\n\r\nJust as we sat down at the table we were annoyed by Gowing entering\r\nwithout knocking.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to stop, but I have brought with me a sealed\r\nenvelope, which I know I can trust with Mrs. Pooter.  In that sealed\r\nenvelope is a strip of paper on which I have asked a simple question.  If\r\nthe spirits can answer that question, I will believe in Spiritualism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ventured the expression that it might be impossible.\r\n\r\nMrs. James said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh no! it is of common occurrence for the spirits to\r\nanswer questions under such conditions\xe2\x80\x94and even for them to write on\r\nlocked slates.  It is quite worth trying.  If \xe2\x80\x98Lina\xe2\x80\x99 is in a good temper,\r\nshe is certain to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGowing said: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right; then I shall be a firm believer.  I shall\r\nperhaps drop in about half-past nine or ten, and hear the result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then left and we sat a long time.  Cummings wanted to know something\r\nabout some undertaking in which he was concerned, but he could get no\r\nanswer of any description whatever\xe2\x80\x94at which he said he was very\r\ndisappointed and was afraid there was not much in table-turning after\r\nall.  I thought this rather selfish of him.  The s\xc3\xa9ance was very similar\r\nto the one last night, almost the same in fact.  So we turned to the\r\nletter.  \xe2\x80\x9cLina\xe2\x80\x9d took a long time answering the question, but eventually\r\nspelt out \xe2\x80\x9cROSES, LILIES, AND COWS.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was great rocking of the\r\ntable at this time, and Mrs. James said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf that is Captain Drinkwater,\r\nlet us ask him the answer as well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the spirit of the Captain, and, most singular, he gave the same\r\nidentical answer: \xe2\x80\x9cROSES, LILIES, AND COWS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the agitation with which Carrie broke the seal, or the\r\ndisappointment we felt on reading the question, to which the answer was\r\nso inappropriate.  The question was, \xe2\x80\x9c_What\xe2\x80\x99s old Pooter\xe2\x80\x99s age_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis quite decided me.\r\n\r\nAs I had put my foot down on Spiritualism years ago, so I would again.\r\n\r\nI am pretty easy-going as a rule, but I can be extremely firm when driven\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nI said slowly, as I turned up the gas: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last of this nonsense\r\nthat shall ever take place under my roof.  I regret I permitted myself to\r\nbe a party to such tomfoolery.  If there is anything in it\xe2\x80\x94which I\r\ndoubt\xe2\x80\x94it is nothing of any good, and I _won\xe2\x80\x99t have it again_.  That is\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. James said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think, Mr. Pooter, you are rather over-stepping\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cHush, madam.  I am master of this house\xe2\x80\x94please understand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. James made an observation which I sincerely hope I was mistaken in.\r\nI was in such a rage I could not quite catch what she said.  But if I\r\nthought she said what it sounded like, she should never enter the house\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLupin leaves us.  We dine at his new apartments, and hear some\r\nextraordinary information respecting the wealth of Mr. Murray Posh.  Meet\r\nMiss Lilian Posh.  Am sent for by Mr. Hardfur Huttle.  Important.\r\n\r\nJULY 1.\xe2\x80\x94I find, on looking over my diary, nothing of any consequence has\r\ntaken place during the last month.  To-day we lose Lupin, who has taken\r\nfurnished apartments at Bayswater, near his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Murray\r\nPosh, at two guineas a week.  I think this is most extravagant of him, as\r\nit is half his salary.  Lupin says one never loses by a good address,\r\nand, to use his own expression, Brickfield Terrace is a bit \xe2\x80\x9coff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhether he means it is \xe2\x80\x9cfar off\xe2\x80\x9d I do not know.  I have long since given\r\nup trying to understand his curious expressions.  I said the\r\nneighbourhood had always been good enough for his parents.  His reply\r\nwas: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no question of being good or bad.  There is no money in it,\r\nand I am not going to rot away my life in the suburbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe are sorry to lose him, but perhaps he will get on better by himself,\r\nand there may be some truth in his remark that an old and a young horse\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t pull together in the same cart.\r\n\r\nGowing called, and said that the house seemed quite peaceful, and like\r\nold times.  He liked Master Lupin very well, but he occasionally suffered\r\nfrom what he could not help\xe2\x80\x94youth.\r\n\r\nJULY 2.\xe2\x80\x94Cummings called, looked very pale, and said he had been very ill\r\nagain, and of course not a single friend had been near him.  Carrie said\r\nshe had never heard of it, whereupon he threw down a copy of the _Bicycle\r\nNews_ on the table, with the following paragraph: \xe2\x80\x9cWe regret to hear that\r\nthat favourite old roadster, Mr. Cummings (\xe2\x80\x98Long\xe2\x80\x99 Cummings), has met with\r\nwhat might have been a serious accident in Rye Lane.  A mischievous boy\r\nthrew a stick between the spokes of one of the back wheels, and the\r\nmachine overturned, bringing our brother tricyclist heavily to the\r\nground.  Fortunately he was more frightened than hurt, but we missed his\r\nmerry face at the dinner at Chingford, where they turned up in good\r\nnumbers.  \xe2\x80\x98Long\xe2\x80\x99 Cummings\xe2\x80\x99 health was proposed by our popular Vice, Mr.\r\nWestropp, the prince of bicyclists, who in his happiest vein said it was\r\na case of \xe2\x80\x98_Cumming_(s) thro\xe2\x80\x99 the _Rye_, but fortunately there was more\r\n_wheel_ than _woe_,\xe2\x80\x99 a joke which created roars of laughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all said we were very sorry, and pressed Cummings to stay to supper.\r\nCummings said it was like old times being without Lupin, and he was much\r\nbetter away.\r\n\r\nJULY 3, Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94In the afternoon, as I was looking out of the parlour\r\nwindow, which was open, a grand trap, driven by a lady, with a gentleman\r\nseated by the side of her, stopped at our door.  Not wishing to be seen,\r\nI withdrew my head very quickly, knocking the back of it violently\r\nagainst the sharp edge of the window-sash.  I was nearly stunned.  There\r\nwas a loud double-knock at the front door; Carrie rushed out of the\r\nparlour, upstairs to her room, and I followed, as Carrie thought it was\r\nMr. Perkupp.  I thought it was Mr. Franching.\xe2\x80\x94I whispered to Sarah over\r\nthe banisters: \xe2\x80\x9cShow them into the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sarah said, as the\r\nshutters were not opened, the room would smell musty.  There was another\r\nloud rat-tat.  I whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cThen show them into the parlour, and say Mr.\r\nPooter will be down directly.\xe2\x80\x9d  I changed my coat, but could not see to\r\ndo my hair, as Carrie was occupying the glass.\r\n\r\nSarah came up, and said it was Mrs. Murray Posh and Mr. Lupin.\r\n\r\nThis was quite a relief.  I went down with Carrie, and Lupin met me with\r\nthe remark: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, what did you run away from the window for?  Did we\r\nfrighten you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI foolishly said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know.  Shut it.  You looked as if you were playing\r\nat Punch and Judy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn Carrie asking if she could offer them anything, Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\r\nthink Daisy will take on a cup of tea.  I can do with a B. and S.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid we have no soda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother about that.  You just trip out and hold the\r\nhorse; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Sarah understands it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stayed a very short time, and as they were leaving, Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant you both to come and dine with me next Wednesday, and see my new\r\nplace.  Mr. and Mrs. Murray Posh, Miss Posh (Murray\xe2\x80\x99s sister) are coming.\r\nEight o\xe2\x80\x99clock sharp.  No one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said we did not pretend to be fashionable people, and would like the\r\ndinner earlier, as it made it so late before we got home.\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cRats!  You must get used to it.  If it comes to that, Daisy\r\nand I can drive you home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe promised to go; but I must say in my simple mind the familiar way in\r\nwhich Mrs. Posh and Lupin addressed each other is reprehensible.  Anybody\r\nwould think they had been children together.  I certainly should object\r\nto a six months\xe2\x80\x99 acquaintance calling _my_ wife \xe2\x80\x9cCarrie,\xe2\x80\x9d and driving out\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nJULY 4.\xe2\x80\x94Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s rooms looked very nice; but the dinner was, I thought, a\r\nlittle too grand, especially as he commenced with champagne straight off.\r\nI also think Lupin might have told us that he and Mr. and Mrs. Murray\r\nPosh and Miss Posh were going to put on full evening dress.  Knowing that\r\nthe dinner was only for us six, we never dreamed it would be a full dress\r\naffair.  I had no appetite.  It was quite twenty minutes past eight\r\nbefore we sat down to dinner.  At six I could have eaten a hearty meal.\r\nI had a bit of bread-and-butter at that hour, feeling famished, and I\r\nexpect that partly spoiled my appetite.\r\n\r\nWe were introduced to Miss Posh, whom Lupin called \xe2\x80\x9cLillie Girl,\xe2\x80\x9d as if\r\nhe had known her all his life.  She was very tall, rather plain, and I\r\nthought she was a little painted round the eyes.  I hope I am wrong; but\r\nshe had such fair hair, and yet her eyebrows were black.  She looked\r\nabout thirty.  I did not like the way she kept giggling and giving Lupin\r\nsmacks and pinching him.  Then her laugh was a sort of a scream that went\r\nright through my ears, all the more irritating because there was nothing\r\nto laugh at.  In fact, Carrie and I were not at all prepossessed with\r\nher.  They all smoked cigarettes after dinner, including Miss Posh, who\r\nstartled Carrie by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you smoke, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d  I answered for\r\nCarrie, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Charles Pooter has not arrived at it yet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhereupon Miss Posh gave one of her piercing laughs again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Posh sang a dozen songs at least, and I can only repeat what I have\r\nsaid before\xe2\x80\x94she does _not_ sing in tune; but Lupin sat by the side of the\r\npiano, gazing into her eyes the whole time.  If I had been Mr. Posh, I\r\nthink I should have had something to say about it.  Mr. Posh made himself\r\nvery agreeable to us, and eventually sent us home in his carriage, which\r\nI thought most kind.  He is evidently very rich, for Mrs. Posh had on\r\nsome beautiful jewellery.  She told Carrie her necklace, which her\r\nhusband gave her as a birthday present, alone cost \xc2\xa3300.\r\n\r\nMr. Posh said he had a great belief in Lupin, and thought he would make\r\nrapid way in the world.\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking of the \xc2\xa3600 Mr. Posh lost over the _Parachikka\r\nChlorates_ through Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s advice.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening I had an opportunity to speak to Lupin, and expressed\r\na hope that Mr. Posh was not living beyond his means.\r\n\r\nLupin sneered, and said Mr. Posh was worth thousands.  \xe2\x80\x9cPosh\xe2\x80\x99s one-price\r\nhat\xe2\x80\x9d was a household word in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and all\r\nthe big towns throughout England.  Lupin further informed me that Mr.\r\nPosh was opening branch establishments at New York, Sydney, and\r\nMelbourne, and was negotiating for Kimberley and Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nI said I was pleased to hear it.\r\n\r\nLupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he has settled over \xc2\xa310,000 on Daisy, and the same\r\namount on \xe2\x80\x98Lillie Girl.\xe2\x80\x99  If at any time I wanted a little capital, he\r\nwould put up a couple of \xe2\x80\x98thou\xe2\x80\x99 at a day\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and could buy up\r\nPerkupp\xe2\x80\x99s firm over his head at any moment with ready cash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the way home in the carriage, for the first time in my life, I was\r\ninclined to indulge in the radical thought that money was _not_ properly\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nOn arriving home at a quarter-past eleven, we found a hansom cab, which\r\nhad been waiting for me for two hours with a letter.  Sarah said she did\r\nnot know what to do, as we had not left the address where we had gone.  I\r\ntrembled as I opened the letter, fearing it was some bad news about Mr.\r\nPerkupp.  The note was: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Pooter,\xe2\x80\x94Come down to the Victoria Hotel\r\nwithout delay.  Important.  Yours truly, Hardfur Huttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked the cabman if it was too late.  The cabman replied that it was\r\n_not_; for his instructions were, if I happened to be out, he was to wait\r\ntill I came home.  I felt very tired, and really wanted to go to bed.  I\r\nreached the hotel at a quarter before midnight.  I apologised for being\r\nso late, but Mr. Huttle said: \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; come and have a few oysters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI feel my heart beating as I write these words.  To be brief, Mr. Huttle\r\nsaid he had a rich American friend who wanted to do something large in\r\nour line of business, and that Mr. Franching had mentioned my name to\r\nhim.  We talked over the matter.  If, by any happy chance, the result be\r\nsuccessful, I can more than compensate my dear master for the loss of Mr.\r\nCrowbillon\xe2\x80\x99s custom.  Mr. Huttle had previously said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe glorious\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fourth\xe2\x80\x99 is a lucky day for America, and, as it has not yet struck\r\ntwelve, we will celebrate it with a glass of the best wine to be had in\r\nthe place, and drink good luck to our bit of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fervently hope it will bring good luck to us all.\r\n\r\nIt was two o\xe2\x80\x99clock when I got home.  Although I was so tired, I could not\r\nsleep except for short intervals\xe2\x80\x94then only to dream.\r\n\r\nI kept dreaming of Mr. Perkupp and Mr. Huttle.  The latter was in a\r\nlovely palace with a crown on.  Mr. Perkupp was waiting in the room.  Mr.\r\nHuttle kept taking off this crown and handing it to me, and calling me\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to take no notice of Mr. Perkupp, and I kept asking Mr.\r\nHuttle to give the crown to my worthy master.  Mr. Huttle kept saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, this is the White House of Washington, and you must keep your crown,\r\nMr. President.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all laughed long and very loudly, till I got parched, and then I woke\r\nup.  I fell asleep, only to dream the same thing over and over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the happiest days of my life.\r\n\r\nJULY 10.\xe2\x80\x94The excitement and anxiety through which I have gone the last\r\nfew days have been almost enough to turn my hair grey.  It is all but\r\nsettled.  To-morrow the die will be cast.  I have written a long letter\r\nto Lupin\xe2\x80\x94feeling it my duty to do so,\xe2\x80\x94regarding his attention to Mrs.\r\nPosh, for they drove up to our house again last night.\r\n\r\nJULY 11.\xe2\x80\x94I find my eyes filling with tears as I pen the note of my\r\ninterview this morning with Mr. Perkupp.  Addressing me, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfaithful servant, I will not dwell on the important service you have done\r\nour firm.  You can never be sufficiently thanked.  Let us change the\r\nsubject.  Do you like your house, and are you happy where you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; I love my house and I love the neighbourhood, and\r\ncould not bear to leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Perkupp, to my surprise, said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pooter, I will purchase the\r\nfreehold of that house, and present it to the most honest and most worthy\r\nman it has ever been my lot to meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook my hand, and said he hoped my wife and I would be spared many\r\nyears to enjoy it.  My heart was too full to thank him; and, seeing my\r\nembarrassment, the good fellow said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou need say nothing, Mr. Pooter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand left the office.\r\n\r\nI sent telegrams to Carrie, Gowing, and Cummings (a thing I have never\r\ndone before), and asked the two latter to come round to supper.\r\n\r\nOn arriving home I found Carrie crying with joy, and I sent Sarah round\r\nto the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s to get two bottles of \xe2\x80\x9cJackson Fr\xc3\xa8res.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy two dear friends came in the evening, and the last post brought a\r\nletter from Lupin in reply to mine.  I read it aloud to them all.  It\r\nran: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear old Guv.,\xe2\x80\x94Keep your hair on.  You are on the wrong tack\r\nagain.  I am engaged to be married to \xe2\x80\x98Lillie Girl.\xe2\x80\x99  I did not mention\r\nit last Thursday, as it was not definitely settled.  We shall be married\r\nin August, and amongst our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing\r\nand Cummings.  With much love to all, from _The same old Lupin_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DIARY OF A NOBODY ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
