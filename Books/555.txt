The meal was of that elegant proportion which,\r\nwhile ministering sympathetically to the desires of the moment, is\r\nhappily reminiscent of a satisfactory luncheon and blessedly expectant of\r\nan elaborate dinner to come.\r\n\r\nIn her younger days Francesca had been known as the beautiful Miss\r\nGreech; at forty, although much of the original beauty remained, she was\r\njust dear Francesca Bassington.  No one would have dreamed of calling her\r\nsweet, but a good many people who scarcely knew her were punctilious\r\nabout putting in the \xe2\x80\x9cdear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer enemies, in their honester moments, would have admitted that she was\r\nsvelte and knew how to dress, but they would have agreed with her friends\r\nin asserting that she had no soul.  When one\xe2\x80\x99s friends and enemies agree\r\non any particular point they are usually wrong.  Francesca herself, if\r\npressed in an unguarded moment to describe her soul, would probably have\r\ndescribed her drawing-room.  Not that she would have considered that the\r\none had stamped the impress of its character on the other, so that close\r\nscrutiny might reveal its outstanding features, and even suggest its\r\nhidden places, but because she might have dimly recognised that her\r\ndrawing-room was her soul.\r\n\r\nFrancesca was one of those women towards whom Fate appears to have the\r\nbest intentions and never to carry them into practice.  With the\r\nadvantages put at her disposal she might have been expected to command a\r\nmore than average share of feminine happiness.  So many of the things\r\nthat make for fretfulness, disappointment and discouragement in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife were removed from her path that she might well have been considered\r\nthe fortunate Miss Greech, or later, lucky Francesca Bassington.  And she\r\nwas not of the perverse band of those who make a rock-garden of their\r\nsouls by dragging into them all the stoney griefs and unclaimed troubles\r\nthey can find lying around them.  Francesca loved the smooth ways and\r\npleasant places of life; she liked not merely to look on the bright side\r\nof things but to live there and stay there.  And the fact that things\r\nhad, at one time and another, gone badly with her and cheated her of some\r\nof her early illusions made her cling the closer to such good fortune as\r\nremained to her now that she seemed to have reached a calmer period of\r\nher life.  To undiscriminating friends she appeared in the guise of a\r\nrather selfish woman, but it was merely the selfishness of one who had\r\nseen the happy and unhappy sides of life and wished to enjoy to the\r\nutmost what was left to her of the former.  The vicissitudes of fortune\r\nhad not soured her, but they had perhaps narrowed her in the sense of\r\nmaking her concentrate much of her sympathies on things that immediately\r\npleased and amused her, or that recalled and perpetuated the pleasing and\r\nsuccessful incidents of other days.  And it was her drawing-room in\r\nparticular that enshrined the memorials or tokens of past and present\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nInto that comfortable quaint-shaped room of angles and bays and alcoves\r\nhad sailed, as into a harbour, those precious personal possessions and\r\ntrophies that had survived the buffetings and storms of a not very\r\ntranquil married life.  Wherever her eyes might turn she saw the embodied\r\nresults of her successes, economies, good luck, good management or good\r\ntaste.  The battle had more than once gone against her, but she had\r\nsomehow always contrived to save her baggage train, and her complacent\r\ngaze could roam over object after object that represented the spoils of\r\nvictory or the salvage of honourable defeat.  The delicious bronze\r\nFremiet on the mantelpiece had been the outcome of a Grand Prix\r\nsweepstake of many years ago; a group of Dresden figures of some\r\nconsiderable value had been bequeathed to her by a discreet admirer, who\r\nhad added death to his other kindnesses; another group had been a\r\nself-bestowed present, purchased in blessed and unfading memory of a\r\nwonderful nine-days\xe2\x80\x99 bridge winnings at a country-house party.  There\r\nwere old Persian and Bokharan rugs and Worcester tea-services of glowing\r\ncolour, and little treasures of antique silver that each enshrined a\r\nhistory or a memory in addition to its own intrinsic value.  It amused\r\nher at times to think of the bygone craftsmen and artificers who had\r\nhammered and wrought and woven in far distant countries and ages, to\r\nproduce the wonderful and beautiful things that had come, one way and\r\nanother, into her possession.  Workers in the studios of medieval Italian\r\ntowns and of later Paris, in the bazaars of Baghdad and of Central Asia,\r\nin old-time English workshops and German factories, in all manner of\r\nqueer hidden corners where craft secrets were jealously guarded, nameless\r\nunremembered men and men whose names were world-renowned and deathless.\r\n\r\nAnd above all her other treasures, dominating in her estimation every\r\nother object that the room contained, was the great Van der Meulen that\r\nhad come from her father\xe2\x80\x99s home as part of her wedding dowry.  It fitted\r\nexactly into the central wall panel above the narrow buhl cabinet, and\r\nfilled exactly its right space in the composition and balance of the\r\nroom.  From wherever you sat it seemed to confront you as the dominating\r\nfeature of its surroundings.  There was a pleasing serenity about the\r\ngreat pompous battle scene with its solemn courtly warriors bestriding\r\ntheir heavily prancing steeds, grey or skewbald or dun, all gravely in\r\nearnest, and yet somehow conveying the impression that their campaigns\r\nwere but vast serious picnics arranged in the grand manner.  Francesca\r\ncould not imagine the drawing-room without the crowning complement of the\r\nstately well-hung picture, just as she could not imagine herself in any\r\nother setting than this house in Blue Street with its crowded Pantheon of\r\ncherished household gods.\r\n\r\nAnd herein sprouted one of the thorns that obtruded through the rose-leaf\r\ndamask of what might otherwise have been Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s peace of mind.\r\nOne\xe2\x80\x99s happiness always lies in the future rather than in the past.  With\r\ndue deference to an esteemed lyrical authority one may safely say that a\r\nsorrow\xe2\x80\x99s crown of sorrow is anticipating unhappier things.  The house in\r\nBlue Street had been left to her by her old friend Sophie Chetrof, but\r\nonly until such time as her niece Emmeline Chetrof should marry, when it\r\nwas to pass to her as a wedding present.  Emmeline was now seventeen and\r\npassably good-looking, and four or five years were all that could be\r\nsafely allotted to the span of her continued spinsterhood.  Beyond that\r\nperiod lay chaos, the wrenching asunder of Francesca from the sheltering\r\nhabitation that had grown to be her soul.  It is true that in imagination\r\nshe had built herself a bridge across the chasm, a bridge of a single\r\nspan.  The bridge in question was her schoolboy son Comus, now being\r\neducated somewhere in the southern counties, or rather one should say the\r\nbridge consisted of the possibility of his eventual marriage with\r\nEmmeline, in which case Francesca saw herself still reigning, a trifle\r\nsqueezed and incommoded perhaps, but still reigning in the house in Blue\r\nStreet.  The Van der Meulen would still catch its requisite afternoon\r\nlight in its place of honour, the Fremiet and the Dresden and Old\r\nWorcester would continue undisturbed in their accustomed niches.\r\nEmmeline could have the Japanese snuggery, where Francesca sometimes\r\ndrank her after-dinner coffee, as a separate drawing-room, where she\r\ncould put her own things.  The details of the bridge structure had all\r\nbeen carefully thought out.  Only\xe2\x80\x94it was an unfortunate circumstance that\r\nComus should have been the span on which everything balanced.\r\n\r\nFrancesca\xe2\x80\x99s husband had insisted on giving the boy that strange Pagan\r\nname, and had not lived long enough to judge as to the appropriateness,\r\nor otherwise, of its significance.  In seventeen years and some odd\r\nmonths Francesca had had ample opportunity for forming an opinion\r\nconcerning her son\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics.  The spirit of mirthfulness which\r\none associates with the name certainly ran riot in the boy, but it was a\r\ntwisted wayward sort of mirth of which Francesca herself could seldom see\r\nthe humorous side.  In her brother Henry, who sat eating small cress\r\nsandwiches as solemnly as though they had been ordained in some\r\nimmemorial Book of Observances, fate had been undisguisedly kind to her.\r\nHe might so easily have married some pretty helpless little woman, and\r\nlived at Notting Hill Gate, and been the father of a long string of pale,\r\nclever useless children, who would have had birthdays and the sort of\r\nillnesses that one is expected to send grapes to, and who would have\r\npainted fatuous objects in a South Kensington manner as Christmas\r\nofferings to an aunt whose cubic space for lumber was limited.  Instead\r\nof committing these unbrotherly actions, which are so frequent in family\r\nlife that they might almost be called brotherly, Henry had married a\r\nwoman who had both money and a sense of repose, and their one child had\r\nthe brilliant virtue of never saying anything which even its parents\r\ncould consider worth repeating.  Then he had gone into Parliament,\r\npossibly with the idea of making his home life seem less dull; at any\r\nrate it redeemed his career from insignificance, for no man whose death\r\ncan produce the item \xe2\x80\x9canother by-election\xe2\x80\x9d on the news posters can be\r\nwholly a nonentity.  Henry, in short, who might have been an\r\nembarrassment and a handicap, had chosen rather to be a friend and\r\ncounsellor, at times even an emergency bank balance; Francesca on her\r\npart, with the partiality which a clever and lazily-inclined woman often\r\nfeels for a reliable fool, not only sought his counsel but frequently\r\nfollowed it.  When convenient, moreover, she repaid his loans.\r\n\r\nAgainst this good service on the part of Fate in providing her with Henry\r\nfor a brother, Francesca could well set the plaguy malice of the destiny\r\nthat had given her Comus for a son.  The boy was one of those untameable\r\nyoung lords of misrule that frolic and chafe themselves through nursery\r\nand preparatory and public-school days with the utmost allowance of storm\r\nand dust and dislocation and the least possible amount of collar-work,\r\nand come somehow with a laugh through a series of catastrophes that has\r\nreduced everyone else concerned to tears or Cassandra-like forebodings.\r\nSometimes they sober down in after-life and become uninteresting,\r\nforgetting that they were ever lords of anything; sometimes Fate plays\r\nroyally into their hands, and they do great things in a spacious manner,\r\nand are thanked by Parliaments and the Press and acclaimed by gala-day\r\ncrowds.  But in most cases their tragedy begins when they leave school\r\nand turn themselves loose in a world that has grown too civilised and too\r\ncrowded and too empty to have any place for them.  And they are very\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nHenry Greech had made an end of biting small sandwiches, and settled down\r\nlike a dust-storm refreshed, to discuss one of the fashionably prevalent\r\ntopics of the moment, the prevention of destitution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a question that is only being nibbled at, smelt at, one might say,\r\nat the present moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is one that will have to\r\nengage our serious attention and consideration before long.  The first\r\nthing that we shall have to do is to get out of the dilettante and\r\nacademic way of approaching it.  We must collect and assimilate hard\r\nfacts.  It is a subject that ought to appeal to all thinking minds, and\r\nyet, you know, I find it surprisingly difficult to interest people in\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca made some monosyllabic response, a sort of sympathetic grunt\r\nwhich was meant to indicate that she was, to a certain extent, listening\r\nand appreciating.  In reality she was reflecting that Henry possibly\r\nfound it difficult to interest people in any topic that he enlarged on.\r\nHis talents lay so thoroughly in the direction of being uninteresting,\r\nthat even as an eye-witness of the massacre of St. Bartholomew he would\r\nprobably have infused a flavour of boredom into his descriptions of the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was speaking down in Leicestershire the other day on this subject,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cand I pointed out at some length a thing that few\r\npeople ever stop to consider\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca went over immediately but decorously to the majority that will\r\nnot stop to consider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come across any of the Barnets when you were down there?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninterrupted; \xe2\x80\x9cEliza Barnet is rather taken up with all those subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the propagandist movements of Sociology, as in other arenas of life\r\nand struggle, the fiercest competition and rivalry is frequently to be\r\nfound between closely allied types and species.  Eliza Barnet shared many\r\nof Henry Greech\xe2\x80\x99s political and social views, but she also shared his\r\nfondness for pointing things out at some length; there had been occasions\r\nwhen she had extensively occupied the strictly limited span allotted to\r\nthe platform oratory of a group of speakers of whom Henry Greech had been\r\nan impatient unit.  He might see eye to eye with her on the leading\r\nquestions of the day, but he persistently wore mental blinkers as far as\r\nher estimable qualities were concerned, and the mention of her name was a\r\nskilful lure drawn across the trail of his discourse; if Francesca had to\r\nlisten to his eloquence on any subject she much preferred that it should\r\nbe a disparagement of Eliza Barnet rather than the prevention of\r\ndestitution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt she means well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it would be a good thing\r\nif she could be induced to keep her own personality a little more in the\r\nbackground, and not to imagine that she is the necessary mouthpiece of\r\nall the progressive thought in the countryside.  I fancy Canon Besomley\r\nmust have had her in his mind when he said that some people came into the\r\nworld to shake empires and others to move amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca laughed with genuine amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she is really wonderfully well up in all the subjects she\r\ntalks about,\xe2\x80\x9d was her provocative comment.\r\n\r\nHenry grew possibly conscious of the fact that he was being drawn out on\r\nthe subject of Eliza Barnet, and he presently turned on to a more\r\npersonal topic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the general air of tranquillity about the house I presume Comus has\r\ngone back to Thaleby,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca, \xe2\x80\x9che went back yesterday.  Of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond\r\nof him, but I bear the separation well.  When he\xe2\x80\x99s here it\xe2\x80\x99s rather like\r\nhaving a live volcano in the house, a volcano that in its quietest\r\nmoments asks incessant questions and uses strong scent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only a temporary respite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry; \xe2\x80\x9cin a year or two he will\r\nbe leaving school, and then what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca closed her eyes with the air of one who seeks to shut out a\r\ndistressing vision.  She was not fond of looking intimately at the future\r\nin the presence of another person, especially when the future was draped\r\nin doubtfully auspicious colours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then what?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I suppose he will be upon my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t sit there looking judicial.  I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready to listen to\r\nsuggestions if you\xe2\x80\x99ve any to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of any ordinary boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cI might make lots of\r\nsuggestions as to the finding of suitable employment.  From what we know\r\nof Comus it would be rather a waste of time for either of us to look for\r\njobs which he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at when we\xe2\x80\x99d got them for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must do something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he must; but he never will.  At least, he\xe2\x80\x99ll never stick to\r\nanything.  The most hopeful thing to do with him will be to marry him to\r\nan heiress.  That would solve the financial side of his problem.  If he\r\nhad unlimited money at his disposal, he might go into the wilds somewhere\r\nand shoot big game.  I never know what the big game have done to deserve\r\nit, but they do help to deflect the destructive energies of some of our\r\nsocial misfits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry, who never killed anything larger or fiercer than a trout, was\r\nscornfully superior on the subject of big game shooting.\r\n\r\nFrancesca brightened at the matrimonial suggestion.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about\r\nan heiress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said reflectively.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Emmeline Chetrof of course.\r\nOne could hardly call her an heiress, but she\xe2\x80\x99s got a comfortable little\r\nincome of her own and I suppose something more will come to her from her\r\ngrandmother.  Then, of course, you know this house goes to her when she\r\nmarries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be very convenient,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, probably following a line of\r\nthought that his sister had trodden many hundreds of times before him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo she and Comus hit it off at all well together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well enough in boy and girl fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca.  \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\narrange for them to see more of each other in future.  By the way, that\r\nlittle brother of hers that she dotes on, Lancelot, goes to Thaleby this\r\nterm.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll write and tell Comus to be specially kind to him; that will\r\nbe a sure way to Emmeline\xe2\x80\x99s heart.  Comus has been made a prefect, you\r\nknow.  Heaven knows why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can only be for prominence in games,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Henry; \xe2\x80\x9cI think we may\r\nsafely leave work and conduct out of the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComus was not a favourite with his uncle.\r\n\r\nFrancesca had turned to her writing cabinet and was hastily scribbling a\r\nletter to her son in which the delicate health, timid disposition and\r\nother inevitable attributes of the new boy were brought to his notice,\r\nand commanded to his care.  When she had sealed and stamped the envelope\r\nHenry uttered a belated caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps on the whole it would be wiser to say nothing about the boy to\r\nComus.  He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always respond to directions you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca did know, and already was more than half of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion; but the woman who can sacrifice a clean unspoiled penny stamp is\r\nprobably yet unborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nLANCELOT CHETROF stood at the end of a long bare passage, restlessly\r\nconsulting his watch and fervently wishing himself half an hour older\r\nwith a certain painful experience already registered in the past;\r\nunfortunately it still belonged to the future, and what was still more\r\nhorrible, to the immediate future.  Like many boys new to a school he had\r\ncultivated an unhealthy passion for obeying rules and requirements, and\r\nhis zeal in this direction had proved his undoing.  In his hurry to be\r\ndoing two or three estimable things at once he had omitted to study the\r\nnotice-board in more than a perfunctory fashion and had thereby missed a\r\nfootball practice specially ordained for newly-joined boys.  His fellow\r\njuniors of a term\xe2\x80\x99s longer standing had graphically enlightened him as to\r\nthe inevitable consequences of his lapse; the dread which attaches to the\r\nunknown was, at any rate, deleted from his approaching doom, though at\r\nthe moment he felt scarcely grateful for the knowledge placed at his\r\ndisposal with such lavish solicitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get six of the very best, over the back of a chair,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll draw a chalk line across you, of course you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA chalk line?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather.  So that every cut can be aimed exactly at the same spot.  It\r\nhurts much more that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLancelot tried to nourish a wan hope that there might be an element of\r\nexaggeration in this uncomfortably realistic description.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in the prefects\xe2\x80\x99 room at the other end of the passage, Comus\r\nBassington and a fellow prefect sat also waiting on time, but in a mood\r\nof far more pleasurable expectancy.  Comus was one of the most junior of\r\nthe prefect caste, but by no means the least well-known, and outside the\r\nmasters\xe2\x80\x99 common-room he enjoyed a certain fitful popularity, or at any\r\nrate admiration.  At football he was too erratic to be a really brilliant\r\nplayer, but he tackled as if the act of bringing his man headlong to the\r\nground was in itself a sensuous pleasure, and his weird swear-words\r\nwhenever he got hurt were eagerly treasured by those who were fortunate\r\nenough to hear them.  At athletics in general he was a showy performer,\r\nand although new to the functions of a prefect he had already established\r\na reputation as an effective and artistic caner.  In appearance he\r\nexactly fitted his fanciful Pagan name.  His large green-grey eyes seemed\r\nfor ever asparkle with goblin mischief and the joy of revelry, and the\r\ncurved lips might have been those of some wickedly-laughing faun; one\r\nalmost expected to see embryo horns fretting the smoothness of his sleek\r\ndark hair.  The chin was firm, but one looked in vain for a redeeming\r\ntouch of ill-temper in the handsome, half-mocking, half-petulant face.\r\nWith a strain of sourness in him Comus might have been leavened into\r\nsomething creative and masterful; fate had fashioned him with a certain\r\nwhimsical charm, and left him all unequipped for the greater purposes of\r\nlife.  Perhaps no one would have called him a lovable character, but in\r\nmany respects he was adorable; in all respects he was certainly damned.\r\n\r\nRutley, his companion of the moment, sat watching him and wondering, from\r\nthe depths of a very ordinary brain, whether he liked or hated him; it\r\nwas easy to do either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not really your turn to cane,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, fingering a very serviceable-looking cane\r\nas lovingly as a pious violinist might handle his Strad.  \xe2\x80\x9cI gave Greyson\r\nsome mint-chocolate to let me toss whether I caned or him, and I won.  He\r\nwas rather decent over it and let me have half the chocolate back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe droll lightheartedness which won Comus Bassington such measure of\r\npopularity as he enjoyed among his fellows did not materially help to\r\nendear him to the succession of masters with whom he came in contact\r\nduring the course of his schooldays.  He amused and interested such of\r\nthem as had the saving grace of humour at their disposal, but if they\r\nsighed when he passed from their immediate responsibility it was a sigh\r\nof relief rather than of regret.  The more enlightened and experienced of\r\nthem realised that he was something outside the scope of the things that\r\nthey were called upon to deal with.  A man who has been trained to cope\r\nwith storms, to foresee their coming, and to minimise their consequences,\r\nmay be pardoned if he feels a certain reluctance to measure himself\r\nagainst a tornado.\r\n\r\nMen of more limited outlook and with a correspondingly larger belief in\r\ntheir own powers were ready to tackle the tornado had time permitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I could tame young Bassington if I had your opportunities,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nform-master once remarked to a colleague whose House had the embarrassing\r\ndistinction of numbering Comus among its inmates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid that I should try,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the housemaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reformer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Nature hates any interference with her own arrangements, and if\r\nyou start in to tame the obviously untameable you are taking a fearful\r\nresponsibility on yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense; boys are Nature\xe2\x80\x99s raw material.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMillions of boys are.  There are just a few, and Bassington is one of\r\nthem, who are Nature\xe2\x80\x99s highly finished product when they are in the\r\nschoolboy stage, and we, who are supposed to be moulding raw material,\r\nare quite helpless when we come in contact with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what happens to them when they grow up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey never do grow up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housemaster; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is their tragedy.\r\nBassington will certainly never grow out of his present stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you are talking in the language of Peter Pan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the form-master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not thinking in the manner of Peter Pan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cWith\r\nall reverence for the author of that masterpiece I should say he had a\r\nwonderful and tender insight into the child mind and knew nothing\r\nwhatever about boys.  To make only one criticism on that particular work,\r\ncan you imagine a lot of British boys, or boys of any country that one\r\nknows of, who would stay contentedly playing children\xe2\x80\x99s games in an\r\nunderground cave when there were wolves and pirates and Red Indians to be\r\nhad for the asking on the other side of the trap door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe form-master laughed.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou evidently think that the \xe2\x80\x98Boy who would\r\nnot grow up\xe2\x80\x99 must have been written by a \xe2\x80\x98grown-up who could never have\r\nbeen a boy.\xe2\x80\x99  Perhaps that is the meaning of the \xe2\x80\x98Never-never Land.\xe2\x80\x99  I\r\ndaresay you\xe2\x80\x99re right in your criticism, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you about\r\nBassington.  He\xe2\x80\x99s a handful to deal with, as anyone knows who has come in\r\ncontact with him, but if one\xe2\x80\x99s hands weren\xe2\x80\x99t full with a thousand and one\r\nother things I hold to my opinion that he could be tamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went his way, having maintained a form-master\xe2\x80\x99s inalienable\r\nprivilege of being in the right.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn the prefects\xe2\x80\x99 room, Comus busied himself with the exact position of a\r\nchair planted out in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think everything\xe2\x80\x99s ready,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nRutley glanced at the clock with the air of a Roman elegant in the\r\nCircus, languidly awaiting the introduction of an expected Christian to\r\nan expectant tiger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kid is due in two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d jolly well better not be late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus.\r\n\r\nComus had gone through the mill of many scorching castigations in his\r\nearlier school days, and was able to appreciate to the last ounce the\r\npanic that must be now possessing his foredoomed victim, probably at this\r\nmoment hovering miserably outside the door.  After all, that was part of\r\nthe fun of the thing, and most things have their amusing side if one\r\nknows where to look for it.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and Lancelot entered in response to a\r\nhearty friendly summons to \xe2\x80\x9ccome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to be caned,\xe2\x80\x9d he said breathlessly; adding by way of\r\nidentification, \xe2\x80\x9cmy name\xe2\x80\x99s Chetrof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite bad enough in itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is probably\r\nworse to follow.  You are evidently keeping something back from us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI missed a footer practice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lancelot\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus briefly, picking up his cane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the notice on the board,\xe2\x80\x9d hazarded Lancelot as a forlorn\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are always pleased to listen to excuses, and our charge is two extra\r\ncuts.  That will be eight.  Get over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Comus indicated the chair that stood in sinister isolation in the\r\nmiddle of the room.  Never had an article of furniture seemed more\r\nhateful in Lancelot\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  Comus could well remember the time when a\r\nchair stuck in the middle of a room had seemed to him the most horrible\r\nof manufactured things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend me a piece of chalk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his brother prefect.\r\n\r\nLancelot ruefully recognised the truth of the chalk-line story.\r\n\r\nComus drew the desired line with an anxious exactitude which he would\r\nhave scorned to apply to a diagram of Euclid or a map of the\r\nRusso-Persian frontier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBend a little more forward,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the victim, \xe2\x80\x9cand much tighter.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble to look pleasant, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t see your face anyway.  It\r\nmay sound unorthodox to say so, but this is going to hurt you much more\r\nthan it will hurt me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a carefully measured pause, and then Lancelot was made vividly\r\naware of what a good cane can be made to do in really efficient hands.\r\nAt the second cut he projected himself hurriedly off the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost count,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall have to begin all over\r\nagain.  Kindly get back into the same position.  If you get down again\r\nbefore I\xe2\x80\x99ve finished Rutley will hold you over and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a dozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLancelot got back on to the chair, and was re-arranged to the taste of\r\nhis executioner.  He stayed there somehow or other while Comus made eight\r\naccurate and agonisingly effective shots at the chalk line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his gasping and gulping victim when the\r\ninfliction was over, \xe2\x80\x9cyou said Chetrof, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?  I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nasked to be kind to you.  As a beginning you can clean out my study this\r\nafternoon.  Be awfully careful how you dust the old china.  If you break\r\nany don\xe2\x80\x99t come and tell me but just go and drown yourself somewhere; it\r\nwill save you from a worse fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where your study is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lancelot between his chokes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better find it or I shall have to beat you, really hard this time.\r\nHere, you\xe2\x80\x99d better keep this chalk in your pocket, it\xe2\x80\x99s sure to come in\r\nhandy later on.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to thank me for all I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, it only\r\nembarrasses me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Comus hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got a study Lancelot spent a feverish half-hour in\r\nlooking for it, incidentally missing another footer practice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is very jolly here,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Lancelot to his sister Emmeline.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prefects can give you an awful hot time if they like, but most of\r\nthem are rather decent.  Some are Beasts.  Bassington is a prefect though\r\nonly a junior one.  He is the Limit as Beasts go.  At least I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSchoolboy reticence went no further, but Emmeline filled in the gaps for\r\nherself with the lavish splendour of feminine imagination.  Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbridge went crashing into the abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nON the evening of a certain November day, two years after the events\r\nheretofore chronicled, Francesca Bassington steered her way through the\r\ncrowd that filled the rooms of her friend Serena Golackly, bestowing nods\r\nof vague recognition as she went, but with eyes that were obviously\r\nintent on focussing one particular figure.  Parliament had pulled its\r\nenergies together for an Autumn Session, and both political Parties were\r\nfairly well represented in the throng.  Serena had a harmless way of\r\ninviting a number of more or less public men and women to her house, and\r\nhoping that if you left them together long enough they would constitute a\r\n_salon_.  In pursuance of the same instinct she planted the flower\r\nborders at her week-end cottage retreat in Surrey with a large mixture of\r\nbulbs, and called the result a Dutch garden.  Unfortunately, though you\r\nmay bring brilliant talkers into your home, you cannot always make them\r\ntalk brilliantly, or even talk at all; what is worse you cannot restrict\r\nthe output of those starling-voiced dullards who seem to have, on all\r\nsubjects, so much to say that was well worth leaving unsaid.  One group\r\nthat Francesca passed was discussing a Spanish painter, who was\r\nforty-three, and had painted thousands of square yards of canvas in his\r\ntime, but of whom no one in London had heard till a few months ago; now\r\nthe starling-voices seemed determined that one should hear of very little\r\nelse.  Three women knew how his name was pronounced, another always felt\r\nthat she must go into a forest and pray whenever she saw his pictures,\r\nanother had noticed that there were always pomegranates in his later\r\ncompositions, and a man with an indefensible collar knew what the\r\npomegranates \xe2\x80\x9cmeant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I think so splendid about him,\xe2\x80\x9d said a stout\r\nlady in a loud challenging voice, \xe2\x80\x9cis the way he defies all the\r\nconventions of art while retaining all that the conventions stand for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but have you noticed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d put in the man with the atrocious collar, and\r\nFrancesca pushed desperately on, wondering dimly as she went, what people\r\nfound so unsupportable in the affliction of deafness.  Her progress was\r\nimpeded for a moment by a couple engaged in earnest and voluble\r\ndiscussion of some smouldering question of the day; a thin spectacled\r\nyoung man with the receding forehead that so often denotes advanced\r\nopinions, was talking to a spectacled young woman with a similar type of\r\nforehead, and exceedingly untidy hair.  It was her ambition in life to be\r\ntaken for a Russian girl-student, and she had spent weeks of patient\r\nresearch in trying to find out exactly where you put the tea-leaves in a\r\nsamovar.  She had once been introduced to a young Jewess from Odessa, who\r\nhad died of pneumonia the following week; the experience, slight as it\r\nwas, constituted the spectacled young lady an authority on all things\r\nRussian in the eyes of her immediate set.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk is helpful, talk is needful,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what\r\nwe have got to do is to lift the subject out of the furrow of\r\nindisciplined talk and place it on the threshing-floor of practical\r\ndiscussion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman took advantage of the rhetorical full-stop to dash in\r\nwith the remark which was already marshalled on the tip of her tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn emancipating the serfs of poverty we must be careful to avoid the\r\nmistakes which Russian bureaucracy stumbled into when liberating the\r\nserfs of the soil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused in her turn for the sake of declamatory effect, but recovered\r\nher breath quickly enough to start afresh on level terms with the young\r\nman, who had jumped into the stride of his next sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey got off to a good start that time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s the Prevention of Destitution they\xe2\x80\x99re hammering at.  What on\r\nearth would become of these dear good people if anyone started a crusade\r\nfor the prevention of mediocrity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidway through one of the smaller rooms, still questing for an elusive\r\npresence, she caught sight of someone that she knew, and the shadow of a\r\nfrown passed across her face.  The object of her faintly signalled\r\ndispleasure was Courtenay Youghal, a political spur-winner who seemed\r\nabsurdly youthful to a generation that had never heard of Pitt.  It was\r\nYoughal\xe2\x80\x99s ambition\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps his hobby\xe2\x80\x94to infuse into the greyness of\r\nmodern political life some of the colour of Disraelian dandyism, tempered\r\nwith the correctness of Anglo-Saxon taste, and supplemented by the\r\nflashes of wit that were inherent from the Celtic strain in him.  His\r\nsuccess was only a half-measure.  The public missed in him that touch of\r\nblatancy which it looks for in its rising public men; the decorative\r\nsmoothness of his chestnut-golden hair, and the lively sparkle of his\r\nepigrams were counted to him for good, but the restrained sumptuousness\r\nof his waistcoats and cravats were as wasted efforts.  If he had\r\nhabitually smoked cigarettes in a pink coral mouthpiece, or worn spats of\r\nMackenzie tartan, the great heart of the voting-man, and the gush of the\r\nparagraph-makers might have been unreservedly his.  The art of public\r\nlife consists to a great extent of knowing exactly where to stop and\r\ngoing a bit further.\r\n\r\nIt was not Youghal\xe2\x80\x99s lack of political sagacity that had brought the\r\nmomentary look of disapproval into Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s face.  The fact was that\r\nComus, who had left off being a schoolboy and was now a social problem,\r\nhad lately enrolled himself among the young politician\xe2\x80\x99s associates and\r\nadmirers, and as the boy knew and cared nothing about politics, and\r\nmerely copied Youghal\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoats, and, less successfully, his\r\nconversation, Francesca felt herself justified in deploring the intimacy.\r\nTo a woman who dressed well on comparatively nothing a year it was an\r\nanxious experience to have a son who dressed sumptuously on absolutely\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe cloud that had passed over her face when she caught sight of the\r\noffending Youghal was presently succeeded by a smile of gratified\r\nachievement, as she encountered a bow of recognition and welcome from a\r\nportly middle-aged gentleman, who seemed genuinely anxious to include her\r\nin the rather meagre group that he had gathered about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were just talking about my new charge,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed genially,\r\nincluding in the \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d his somewhat depressed-looking listeners, who in\r\nall human probability had done none of the talking.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was just telling\r\nthem, and you may be interested to hear this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca, with Spartan stoicism, continued to wear an ingratiating\r\nsmile, though the character of the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear and\r\nwill not hearken, seemed to her at that moment a beautiful one.\r\n\r\nSir Julian Jull had been a member of a House of Commons distinguished for\r\nits high standard of well-informed mediocrity, and had harmonised so\r\nthoroughly with his surroundings that the most attentive observer of\r\nParliamentary proceedings could scarcely have told even on which side of\r\nthe House he sat.  A baronetcy bestowed on him by the Party in power had\r\nat least removed that doubt; some weeks later he had been made Governor\r\nof some West Indian dependency, whether as a reward for having accepted\r\nthe baronetcy, or as an application of a theory that West Indian islands\r\nget the Governors they deserve, it would have been hard to say.  To Sir\r\nJulian the appointment was, doubtless, one of some importance; during the\r\nspan of his Governorship the island might possibly be visited by a member\r\nof the Royal Family, or at the least by an earthquake, and in either case\r\nhis name would get into the papers.  To the public the matter was one of\r\nabsolute indifference; \xe2\x80\x9cwho is he and where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d would have correctly\r\nepitomised the sum total of general information on the personal and\r\ngeographical aspects of the case.\r\n\r\nFrancesca, however, from the moment she had heard of the likelihood of\r\nthe appointment, had taken a deep and lively interest in Sir Julian.  As\r\na Member of Parliament he had not filled any very pressing social want in\r\nher life, and on the rare occasions when she took tea on the Terrace of\r\nthe House she was wont to lapse into rapt contemplation of St. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHospital whenever she saw him within bowing distance.  But as Governor of\r\nan island he would, of course, want a private secretary, and as a friend\r\nand colleague of Henry Greech, to whom he was indebted for many little\r\nacts of political support (they had once jointly drafted an amendment\r\nwhich had been ruled out of order), what was more natural and proper than\r\nthat he should let his choice fall on Henry\xe2\x80\x99s nephew Comus?  While\r\nprivately doubting whether the boy would make the sort of secretary that\r\nany public man would esteem as a treasure, Henry was thoroughly in\r\nagreement with Francesca as to the excellence and desirability of an\r\narrangement which would transplant that troublesome\xe2\x80\x99 young animal from\r\nthe too restricted and conspicuous area that centres in the parish of St.\r\nJames\xe2\x80\x99s to some misty corner of the British dominion overseas.  Brother\r\nand sister had conspired to give an elaborate and at the same time cosy\r\nlittle luncheon to Sir Julian on the very day that his appointment was\r\nofficially announced, and the question of the secretaryship had been\r\nmooted and sedulously fostered as occasion permitted, until all that was\r\nnow needed to clinch the matter was a formal interview between His\r\nExcellency and Comus.  The boy had from the first shewn very little\r\ngratification at the prospect of his deportation.  To live on a remote\r\nshark-girt island, as he expressed it, with the Jull family as his chief\r\nsocial mainstay, and Sir Julian\xe2\x80\x99s conversation as a daily item of his\r\nexistence, did not inspire him with the same degree of enthusiasm as was\r\ndisplayed by his mother and uncle, who, after all, were not making the\r\nexperiment.  Even the necessity for an entirely new outfit did not appeal\r\nto his imagination with the force that might have been expected.  But,\r\nhowever lukewarm his adhesion to the project might be, Francesca and her\r\nbrother were clearly determined that no lack of deft persistence on their\r\npart should endanger its success.  It was for the purpose of reminding\r\nSir Julian of his promise to meet Comus at lunch on the following day,\r\nand definitely settle the matter of the secretaryship that Francesca was\r\nnow enduring the ordeal of a long harangue on the value of the West\r\nIndian group as an Imperial asset.  Other listeners dexterously detached\r\nthemselves one by one, but Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s patience outlasted even Sir\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s flow of commonplaces, and her devotion was duly rewarded by a\r\nrenewed acknowledgment of the lunch engagement and its purpose.  She\r\npushed her way back through the throng of starling-voiced chatterers\r\nfortified by a sense of well-earned victory.  Dear Serena\xe2\x80\x99s absurd\r\n_salons_ served some good purpose after all.\r\n\r\nFrancesca was not an early riser and her breakfast was only just\r\nbeginning to mobilise on the breakfast-table next morning when a copy of\r\n_The Times_, sent by special messenger from her brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, was\r\nbrought up to her room.  A heavy margin of blue pencilling drew her\r\nattention to a prominently-printed letter which bore the ironical\r\nheading: \xe2\x80\x9cJulian Jull, Proconsul.\xe2\x80\x9d  The matter of the letter was a cruel\r\ndis-interment of some fatuous and forgotten speeches made by Sir Julian\r\nto his constituents not many years ago, in which the value of some of our\r\nColonial possessions, particularly certain West Indian islands, was\r\ndecried in a medley of pomposity, ignorance and amazingly cheap humour.\r\nThe extracts given sounded weak and foolish enough, taken by themselves,\r\nbut the writer of the letter had interlarded them with comments of his\r\nown, which sparkled with an ironical brilliance that was Cervantes-like\r\nin its polished cruelty.  Remembering her ordeal of the previous evening\r\nFrancesca permitted herself a certain feeling of amusement as she read\r\nthe merciless stabs inflicted on the newly-appointed Governor; then she\r\ncame to the signature at the foot of the letter, and the laughter died\r\nout of her eyes.  \xe2\x80\x9cComus Bassington\xe2\x80\x9d stared at her from above a thick\r\nlayer of blue pencil lines marked by Henry Greech\xe2\x80\x99s shaking hand.\r\n\r\nComus could no more have devised such a letter than he could have written\r\nan Episcopal charge to the clergy of any given diocese.  It was obviously\r\nthe work of Courtenay Youghal, and Comus, for a palpable purpose of his\r\nown, had wheedled him into foregoing for once the pride of authorship in\r\na clever piece of political raillery, and letting his young friend stand\r\nsponsor instead.  It was a daring stroke, and there could be no question\r\nas to its success; the secretaryship and the distant shark-girt island\r\nfaded away into the horizon of impossible things.  Francesca, forgetting\r\nthe golden rule of strategy which enjoins a careful choosing of ground\r\nand opportunity before entering on hostilities, made straight for the\r\nbathroom door, behind which a lively din of splashing betokened that\r\nComus had at least begun his toilet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wicked boy, what have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe washee,\xe2\x80\x9d came a cheerful shout; \xe2\x80\x9cme washee from the neck all the way\r\ndown to the merrythought, and now washee down from the merrythought to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have ruined your future.  _The Times_ has printed that miserable\r\nletter with your signature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA loud squeal of joy came from the bath.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mummy!  Let me see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were sounds as of a sprawling dripping body clambering hastily out\r\nof the bath.  Francesca fled.  One cannot effectively scold a moist\r\nnineteen-year old boy clad only in a bath-towel and a cloud of steam.\r\n\r\nAnother messenger arrived before Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast was over.  This\r\none brought a letter from Sir Julian Jull, excusing himself from\r\nfulfilment of the luncheon engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCESCA prided herself on being able to see things from other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoints of view, which meant, as it usually does, that she could see her\r\nown point of view from various aspects.  As regards Comus, whose doings\r\nand non-doings bulked largely in her thoughts at the present moment, she\r\nhad mapped out in her mind so clearly what his outlook in life ought to\r\nbe, that she was peculiarly unfitted to understand the drift of his\r\nfeelings or the impulses that governed them.  Fate had endowed her with a\r\nson; in limiting the endowment to a solitary offspring Fate had certainly\r\nshown a moderation which Francesca was perfectly willing to acknowledge\r\nand be thankful for; but then, as she pointed out to a certain complacent\r\nfriend of hers who cheerfully sustained an endowment of half-a-dozen male\r\noffsprings and a girl or two, her one child was Comus.  Moderation in\r\nnumbers was more than counterbalanced in his case by extravagance in\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nFrancesca mentally compared her son with hundreds of other young men whom\r\nshe saw around her, steadily, and no doubt happily, engaged in the\r\nprocess of transforming themselves from nice boys into useful citizens.\r\nMost of them had occupations, or were industriously engaged in qualifying\r\nfor such; in their leisure moments they smoked reasonably-priced\r\ncigarettes, went to the cheaper seats at music-halls, watched an\r\noccasional cricket match at Lord\xe2\x80\x99s with apparent interest, saw most of\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular events through the medium of the cinematograph,\r\nand were wont to exchange at parting seemingly superfluous injunctions to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbe good.\xe2\x80\x9d  The whole of Bond Street and many of the tributary\r\nthoroughfares of Piccadilly might have been swept off the face of modern\r\nLondon without in any way interfering with the supply of their daily\r\nwants.  They were doubtless dull as acquaintances, but as sons they would\r\nhave been eminently restful.  With a growing sense of irritation\r\nFrancesca compared these deserving young men with her own intractable\r\noffspring, and wondered why Fate should have singled her out to be the\r\nparent of such a vexatious variant from a comfortable and desirable type.\r\nAs far as remunerative achievement was concerned, Comus copied the\r\ninsouciance of the field lily with a dangerous fidelity.  Like his mother\r\nhe looked round with wistful irritation at the example afforded by\r\ncontemporary youth, but he concentrated his attention exclusively on the\r\nricher circles of his acquaintance, young men who bought cars and polo\r\nponies as unconcernedly as he might purchase a carnation for his\r\nbuttonhole, and went for trips to Cairo or the Tigris valley with less\r\ndifficulty and finance-stretching than he encountered in contriving a\r\nweek-end at Brighton.\r\n\r\nGaiety and good-looks had carried Comus successfully and, on the whole,\r\npleasantly, through schooldays and a recurring succession of holidays;\r\nthe same desirable assets were still at his service to advance him along\r\nhis road, but it was a disconcerting experience to find that they could\r\nnot be relied on to go all distances at all times.  In an animal world,\r\nand a fiercely competitive animal world at that, something more was\r\nneeded than the decorative _abandon_ of the field lily, and it was just\r\nthat something more which Comus seemed unable or unwilling to provide on\r\nhis own account; it was just the lack of that something more which left\r\nhim sulking with Fate over the numerous breakdowns and stumbling-blocks\r\nthat held him up on what he expected to be a triumphal or, at any rate,\r\nunimpeded progress.\r\n\r\nFrancesca was, in her own way, fonder of Comus than of anyone else in the\r\nworld, and if he had been browning his skin somewhere east of Suez she\r\nwould probably have kissed his photograph with genuine fervour every\r\nnight before going to bed; the appearance of a cholera scare or rumour of\r\nnative rising in the columns of her daily news-sheet would have caused\r\nher a flutter of anxiety, and she would have mentally likened herself to\r\na Spartan mother sacrificing her best-beloved on the altar of State\r\nnecessities.  But with the best-beloved installed under her roof,\r\noccupying an unreasonable amount of cubic space, and demanding daily\r\nsacrifices instead of providing the raw material for one, her feelings\r\nwere tinged with irritation rather than affection.  She might have\r\nforgiven Comus generously for misdeeds of some gravity committed in\r\nanother continent, but she could never overlook the fact that out of a\r\ndish of five plovers\xe2\x80\x99 eggs he was certain to take three.  The absent may\r\nbe always wrong, but they are seldom in a position to be inconsiderate.\r\n\r\nThus a wall of ice had grown up gradually between mother and son, a\r\nbarrier across which they could hold converse, but which gave a wintry\r\nchill even to the sparkle of their lightest words.  The boy had the gift\r\nof being irresistibly amusing when he chose to exert himself in that\r\ndirection, and after a long series of moody or jangling meal-sittings he\r\nwould break forth into a torrential flow of small talk, scandal and\r\nmalicious anecdote, true or more generally invented, to which Francesca\r\nlistened with a relish and appreciation, that was all the more flattering\r\nfrom being so unwillingly bestowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you chose your friends from a rather more reputable set you would be\r\ndoubtless less amusing, but there would be compensating advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca snapped the remark out at lunch one day when she had been\r\nbetrayed into a broader smile than she considered the circumstances of\r\nher attitude towards Comus warranted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to move in quite decent society to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Comus with\r\na pleased chuckle; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to meet you and Uncle Henry and heaps of\r\nnice dull God-fearing people at dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca gave a little gasp of surprise and annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say Caroline has asked you to dinner to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cand of course without telling me.  How exceedingly like her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Caroline Benaresq had reached that age when you can say and do what\r\nyou like in defiance of people\xe2\x80\x99s most sensitive feelings and most\r\ncherished antipathies.  Not that she had waited to attain her present age\r\nbefore pursuing that line of conduct; she came of a family whose\r\nindividual members went through life, from the nursery to the grave, with\r\nas much tact and consideration as a cactus-hedge might show in going\r\nthrough a crowded bathing tent.  It was a compensating mercy that they\r\ndisagreed rather more among themselves than they did with the outside\r\nworld; every known variety and shade of religion and politics had been\r\npressed into the family service to avoid the possibility of any agreement\r\non the larger essentials of life, and such unlooked-for happenings as the\r\nHome Rule schism, the Tariff-Reform upheaval and the Suffragette crusade\r\nwere thankfully seized on as furnishing occasion for further differences\r\nand sub-divisions.  Lady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s favourite scheme of entertaining was\r\nto bring jarring and antagonistic elements into close contact and play\r\nthem remorselessly one against the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne gets much better results\r\nunder those circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d she used to observe, \xe2\x80\x9cthan by asking people\r\nwho wish to meet each other.  Few people talk as brilliantly to impress a\r\nfriend as they do to depress an enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe admitted that her theory broke down rather badly if you applied it to\r\nParliamentary debates.  At her own dinner table its success was usually\r\ntriumphantly vindicated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho else is to be there?\xe2\x80\x9d Francesca asked, with some pardonable\r\nmisgiving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourtenay Youghal.  He\xe2\x80\x99ll probably sit next to you, so you\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nthink out a lot of annihilating remarks in readiness.  And Elaine de\r\nFrey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of her.  Who is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody in particular, but rather nice-looking in a solemn sort of way,\r\nand almost indecently rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry her\xe2\x80\x9d was the advice which sprang to Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but she\r\nchoked it back with a salted almond, having a rare perception of the fact\r\nthat words are sometimes given to us to defeat our purposes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaroline has probably marked her down for Toby or one of the\r\ngrand-nephews,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, carelessly; \xe2\x80\x9ca little money would be rather\r\nuseful in that quarter, I imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComus tucked in his underlip with just the shade of pugnacity that she\r\nwanted to see.\r\n\r\nAn advantageous marriage was so obviously the most sensible course for\r\nhim to embark on that she scarcely dared to hope that he would seriously\r\nentertain it; yet there was just a chance that if he got as far as the\r\nflirtation stage with an attractive (and attracted) girl who was also an\r\nheiress, the sheer perversity of his nature might carry him on to more\r\ndefinite courtship, if only from the desire to thrust other more\r\ngenuinely enamoured suitors into the background.  It was a forlorn hope;\r\nso forlorn that the idea even crossed her mind of throwing herself on the\r\nmercy of her _b\xc3\xaate noire_, Courtenay Youghal, and trying to enlist the\r\ninfluence which he seemed to possess over Comus for the purpose of\r\nfurthering her hurriedly conceived project.  Anyhow, the dinner promised\r\nto be more interesting than she had originally anticipated.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline was a professed Socialist in politics, chiefly, it was\r\nbelieved, because she was thus enabled to disagree with most of the\r\nLiberals and Conservatives, and all the Socialists of the day.  She did\r\nnot permit her Socialism, however, to penetrate below stairs; her cook\r\nand butler had every encouragement to be Individualists.  Francesca, who\r\nwas a keen and intelligent food critic, harboured no misgivings as to her\r\nhostess\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen and cellar departments; some of the human side-dishes\r\nat the feast gave her more ground for uneasiness.  Courtenay Youghal, for\r\ninstance, would probably be brilliantly silent; her brother Henry would\r\nalmost certainly be the reverse.\r\n\r\nThe dinner party was a large one and Francesca arrived late with little\r\ntime to take preliminary stock of the guests; a card with the name, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nde Frey,\xe2\x80\x9d immediately opposite her own place at the other side of the\r\ntable, indicated, however, the whereabouts of the heiress.  It was\r\ncharacteristic of Francesca that she first carefully read the menu from\r\nend to end, and then indulged in an equally careful though less open\r\nscrutiny of the girl who sat opposite her, the girl who was nobody in\r\nparticular, but whose income was everything that could be desired.  She\r\nwas pretty in a restrained nut-brown fashion, and had a look of grave\r\nreflective calm that probably masked a speculative unsettled temperament.\r\nHer pose, if one wished to be critical, was just a little too elaborately\r\ncareless.  She wore some excellently set rubies with that indefinable air\r\nof having more at home that is so difficult to improvise.  Francesca was\r\ndistinctly pleased with her survey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem interested in your _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Courtenay Youghal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost think I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca; \xe2\x80\x9cher face seems\r\nfamiliar to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe narrow gallery at the Louvre; attributed to Leonardo da Vinci,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nYoughal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca, her feelings divided between satisfaction at\r\ncapturing an elusive impression and annoyance that Youghal should have\r\nbeen her helper.  A stronger tinge of annoyance possessed her when she\r\nheard the voice of Henry Greech raised in painful prominence at Lady\r\nCaroline\xe2\x80\x99s end of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called on the Trudhams yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced; \xe2\x80\x9cit was their Silver\r\nWedding, you know, at least the day before was.  Such lots of silver\r\npresents, quite a show.  Of course there were a great many duplicates,\r\nbut still, very nice to have.  I think they were very pleased to get so\r\nmany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not grudge them their show of presents after their twenty-five\r\nyears of married life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline, gently; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the silver\r\nlining to their cloud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA third of the guests present were related to the Trudhams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Caroline is beginning well,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Courtenay Youghal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hardly call twenty-five years of married life a cloud,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHenry Greech, lamely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about married life,\xe2\x80\x9d said a tall handsome woman, who\r\nlooked like some modern painter\xe2\x80\x99s conception of the goddess Bellona;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my misfortune to write eternally about husbands and wives and their\r\nvariants.  My public expects it of me.  I do so envy journalists who can\r\nwrite about plagues and strikes and Anarchist plots, and other pleasing\r\nthings, instead of being tied down to one stale old topic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that woman and what has she written?\xe2\x80\x9d Francesca asked Youghal;\r\nshe dimly remembered having seen her at one of Serena Golackly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngatherings, surrounded by a little Court of admirers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forget her name; she has a villa at San Remo or Mentone, or somewhere\r\nwhere one does have villas, and plays an extraordinary good game of\r\nbridge.  Also she has the reputation, rather rare in your sex, of being a\r\nwonderfully sound judge of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has she written?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, several novels of the thinnish ice order.  Her last one, \xe2\x80\x98The Woman\r\nwho wished it was Wednesday,\xe2\x80\x99 has been banned at all the libraries.  I\r\nexpect you\xe2\x80\x99ve read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly because Comus lent me your copy yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal.  He threw\r\nback his handsome head and gave her a sidelong glance of quizzical\r\namusement.  He knew that she hated his intimacy with Comus, and he was\r\nsecretly rather proud of his influence over the boy, shallow and negative\r\nthough he knew it to be.  It had been, on his part, an unsought intimacy,\r\nand it would probably fall to pieces the moment he tried seriously to\r\ntake up the _r\xc3\xb4le_ of mentor.  The fact that Comus\xe2\x80\x99s mother openly\r\ndisapproved of the friendship gave it perhaps its chief interest in the\r\nyoung politician\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nFrancesca turned her attention to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s end of the table.  Henry\r\nGreech had willingly availed himself of the invitation to leave the\r\nsubject of married life, and had launched forthwith into the equally\r\nwell-worn theme of current politics.  He was not a person who was in much\r\ndemand for public meetings, and the House showed no great impatience to\r\nhear his views on the topics of the moment; its impatience, indeed, was\r\nmanifested rather in the opposite direction.  Hence he was prone to\r\nunburden himself of accumulated political wisdom as occasion presented\r\nitself\xe2\x80\x94sometimes, indeed, to assume an occasion that was hardly visible\r\nto the naked intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur opponents are engaged in a hopelessly uphill struggle, and they know\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he chirruped, defiantly; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ve become possessed, like the\r\nGadarene swine, with a whole legion of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely the Gadarene swine went downhill,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Lady Caroline in a\r\ngently enquiring voice.\r\n\r\nHenry Greech hastily abandoned simile and fell back on platitude and the\r\nsafer kinds of fact.\r\n\r\nFrancesca did not regard her brother\xe2\x80\x99s views on statecraft either in the\r\nlight of gospel or revelation; as Comus once remarked, they more usually\r\nsuggested exodus.  In the present instance she found distraction in a\r\nrenewed scrutiny of the girl opposite her, who seemed to be only\r\nmoderately interested in the conversational efforts of the diners on\r\neither side of her.  Comus who was looking and talking his best, was\r\nsitting at the further end of the table, and Francesca was quick to\r\nnotice in which direction the girl\xe2\x80\x99s glances were continually straying.\r\nOnce or twice the eyes of the young people met and a swift flush of\r\npleasure and a half-smile that spoke of good understanding came to the\r\nheiress\xe2\x80\x99s face.  It did not need the gift of the traditional intuition of\r\nher sex to enable Francesca to guess that the girl with the desirable\r\nbanking account was already considerably attracted by the lively young\r\nPagan who had, when he cared to practise it, such an art of winning\r\nadmiration.  For the first time for many, many months Francesca saw her\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s prospects in a rose-coloured setting, and she began, unconsciously,\r\nto wonder exactly how much wealth was summed up in the expressive label\r\n\xe2\x80\x9calmost indecently rich.\xe2\x80\x9d  A wife with a really large fortune and a\r\ncorrespondingly big dower of character and ambition, might, perhaps,\r\nsucceed in turning Comus\xe2\x80\x99s latent energies into a groove which would\r\nprovide him, if not with a career, at least with an occupation, and the\r\nyoung serious face opposite looked as if its owner lacked neither\r\ncharacter or ambition.  Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s speculations took a more personal\r\nturn.  Out of the well-filled coffers with which her imagination was\r\ntoying, an inconsiderable sum might eventually be devoted to the leasing,\r\nor even perhaps the purchase of, the house in Blue Street when the\r\npresent convenient arrangement should have come to an end, and Francesca\r\nand the Van der Meulen would not be obliged to seek fresh quarters.\r\n\r\nA woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice, talking in a discreet undertone on the other side of\r\nCourtenay Youghal, broke in on her bridge-building.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTons of money and really very presentable.  Just the wife for a rising\r\nyoung politician.  Go in and win her before she\xe2\x80\x99s snapped up by some\r\nfortune hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoughal and his instructress in worldly wisdom were looking straight\r\nacross the table at the Leonardo da Vinci girl with the grave reflective\r\neyes and the over-emphasised air of repose.  Francesca felt a quick throb\r\nof anger against her match-making neighbour; why, she asked herself, must\r\nsome women, with no end or purpose of their own to serve, except the\r\nsheer love of meddling in the affairs of others, plunge their hands into\r\nplots and schemings of this sort, in which the happiness of more than one\r\nperson was concerned?  And more clearly than ever she realised how\r\nthoroughly she detested Courtenay Youghal.  She had disliked him as an\r\nevil influence, setting before her son an example of showy ambition that\r\nhe was not in the least likely to follow, and providing him with a model\r\nof extravagant dandyism that he was only too certain to copy.  In her\r\nheart she knew that Comus would have embarked just as surely on his\r\npresent course of idle self-indulgence if he had never known of the\r\nexistence of Youghal, but she chose to regard that young man as her son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevil genius, and now he seemed likely to justify more than ever the\r\ncharacter she had fastened on to him.  For once in his life Comus\r\nappeared to have an idea of behaving sensibly and making some use of his\r\nopportunities, and almost at the same moment Courtenay Youghal arrived on\r\nthe scene as a possible and very dangerous rival.  Against the good looks\r\nand fitful powers of fascination that Comus could bring into the field,\r\nthe young politician could match half-a-dozen dazzling qualities which\r\nwould go far to recommend him in the eyes of a woman of the world, still\r\nmore in those of a young girl in search of an ideal.  Good-looking in his\r\nown way, if not on such showy lines as Comus, always well turned-out,\r\nwitty, self-confident without being bumptious, with a conspicuous\r\nParliamentary career alongside him, and heaven knew what else in front of\r\nhim, Courtenay Youghal certainly was not a rival whose chances could be\r\nheld very lightly.  Francesca laughed bitterly to herself as she\r\nremembered that a few hours ago she had entertained the idea of begging\r\nfor his good offices in helping on Comus\xe2\x80\x99s wooing.  One consolation, at\r\nleast, she found for herself: if Youghal really meant to step in and try\r\nand cut out his young friend, the latter at any rate had snatched a\r\nuseful start.  Comus had mentioned Miss de Frey at luncheon that day,\r\ncasually and dispassionately; if the subject of the dinner guests had not\r\ncome up he would probably not have mentioned her at all.  But they were\r\nobviously already very good friends.  It was part and parcel of the state\r\nof domestic tension at Blue Street that Francesca should only have come\r\nto know of this highly interesting heiress by an accidental sorting of\r\nguests at a dinner party.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s voice broke in on her reflections; it was a gentle\r\npurring voice, that possessed an uncanny quality of being able to make\r\nitself heard down the longest dinner table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dear Archdeacon is getting so absent-minded.  He read a list of\r\nbox-holders for the opera as the First Lesson the other Sunday, instead\r\nof the families and lots of the tribes of Israel that entered Canaan.\r\nFortunately no one noticed the mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nON a conveniently secluded bench facing the Northern Pheasantry in the\r\nZoological Society\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, Courtenay Youghal sat\r\nimmersed in mature flirtation with a lady, who, though certainly young in\r\nfact and appearance, was some four or five years his senior.  When he was\r\na schoolboy of sixteen, Molly McQuade had personally conducted him to the\r\nZoo and stood him dinner afterwards at Kettner\xe2\x80\x99s, and whenever the two of\r\nthem happened to be in town on the anniversary of that bygone festivity\r\nthey religiously repeated the programme in its entirety.  Even the menu\r\nof the dinner was adhered to as nearly as possible; the original\r\nselection of food and wine that schoolboy exuberance, tempered by\r\nschoolboy shyness, had pitched on those many years ago, confronted\r\nYoughal on those occasions, as a drowning man\xe2\x80\x99s past life is said to rise\r\nup and parade itself in his last moments of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe flirtation which was thus perennially restored to its old-time\r\nfooting owed its longevity more to the enterprising solicitude of Miss\r\nMcQuade than to any conscious sentimental effort on the part of Youghal\r\nhimself.  Molly McQuade was known to her neighbours in a minor hunting\r\nshire as a hard-riding conventionally unconventional type of young woman,\r\nwho came naturally into the classification, \xe2\x80\x9ca good sort.\xe2\x80\x9d  She was just\r\nsufficiently good-looking, sufficiently reticent about her own illnesses,\r\nwhen she had any, and sufficiently appreciative of her neighbours\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngardens, children and hunters to be generally popular.  Most men liked\r\nher, and the percentage of women who disliked her was not inconveniently\r\nhigh.  One of these days, it was assumed, she would marry a brewer or a\r\nMaster of Otter Hounds, and, after a brief interval, be known to the\r\nworld as the mother of a boy or two at Malvern or some similar seat of\r\nlearning.  The romantic side of her nature was altogether unguessed by\r\nthe countryside.\r\n\r\nHer romances were mostly in serial form and suffered perhaps in fervour\r\nfrom their disconnected course what they gained in length of days.  Her\r\naffectionate interest in the several young men who figured in her affairs\r\nof the heart was perfectly honest, and she certainly made no attempt\r\neither to conceal their separate existences, or to play them off one\r\nagainst the other.  Neither could it be said that she was a husband\r\nhunter; she had made up her mind what sort of man she was likely to\r\nmarry, and her forecast did not differ very widely from that formed by\r\nher local acquaintances.  If her married life were eventually to turn out\r\na failure, at least she looked forward to it with very moderate\r\nexpectations.  Her love affairs she put on a very different footing and\r\napparently they were the all-absorbing element in her life.  She\r\npossessed the happily constituted temperament which enables a man or\r\nwoman to be a \xe2\x80\x9cpluralist,\xe2\x80\x9d and to observe the sage precaution of not\r\nputting all one\xe2\x80\x99s eggs into one basket.  Her demands were not exacting;\r\nshe required of her affinity that he should be young, good-looking, and\r\nat least, moderately amusing; she would have preferred him to be\r\ninvariably faithful, but, with her own example before her, she was\r\nprepared for the probability, bordering on certainty, that he would be\r\nnothing of the sort.  The philosophy of the \xe2\x80\x9cGarden of Kama\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\ncompass by which she steered her barque and thus far, if she had\r\nencountered some storms and buffeting, she had at least escaped being\r\neither shipwrecked or becalmed.\r\n\r\nCourtenay Youghal had not been designed by Nature to fulfil the _r\xc3\xb4le_ of\r\nan ardent or devoted lover, and he scrupulously respected the limits\r\nwhich Nature had laid down.  For Molly, however, he had a certain\r\nresponsive affection.  She had always obviously admired him, and at the\r\nsame time she never beset him with crude flattery; the principal reason\r\nwhy the flirtation had stood the test of so many years was the fact that\r\nit only flared into active existence at convenient intervals.  In an age\r\nwhen the telephone has undermined almost every fastness of human privacy,\r\nand the sanctity of one\xe2\x80\x99s seclusion depends often on the ability for\r\ntactful falsehood shown by a club pageboy, Youghal was duly appreciative\r\nof the circumstance that his lady fair spent a large part of the year\r\npursuing foxes, in lieu of pursuing him.  Also the honestly admitted fact\r\nthat, in her human hunting, she rode after more than one quarry, made the\r\ninevitable break-up of the affair a matter to which both could look\r\nforward without a sense of coming embarrassment and recrimination.  When\r\nthe time for gathering ye rosebuds should be over, neither of them could\r\naccuse the other of having wrecked his or her entire life.  At the most\r\nthey would only have disorganised a week-end.\r\n\r\nOn this particular afternoon, when old reminiscences had been gone\r\nthrough, and the intervening gossip of past months duly recounted, a lull\r\nin the conversation made itself rather obstinately felt.  Molly had\r\nalready guessed that matters were about to slip into a new phase; the\r\naffair had reached maturity long ago, and a new phase must be in the\r\nnature of a wane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a clever brute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly, with an air of affectionate\r\nregret; \xe2\x80\x9cI always knew you\xe2\x80\x99d get on in the House, but I hardly expected\r\nyou to come to the front so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to the front,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Youghal, judicially; \xe2\x80\x9cthe problem is,\r\nshall I be able to stay there.  Unless something happens in the financial\r\nline before long, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I\xe2\x80\x99m to stay in Parliament at all.\r\nEconomy is out of the question.  It would open people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, I fancy, if\r\nthey knew how little I exist on as it is.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m living so far beyond\r\nmy income that we may almost be said to be living apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will have to be a rich wife, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Molly, slowly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe worst of success, it imposes so many conditions.  I rather knew, from\r\nsomething in your manner, that you were drifting that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoughal said nothing in the way of contradiction; he gazed steadfastly at\r\nthe aviary in front of him as though exotic pheasants were for the moment\r\nthe most absorbing study in the world.  As a matter of fact, his mind was\r\ncentred on the image of Elaine de Frey, with her clear untroubled eyes\r\nand her Leonardo da Vinci air.  He was wondering whether he was likely to\r\nfall into a frame of mind concerning her which would be in the least like\r\nfalling in love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall mind horribly,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Molly, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, of course,\r\nI have always known that something of the sort would have to happen one\r\nof these days.  When a man goes into politics he can\xe2\x80\x99t call his soul his\r\nown, and I suppose his heart becomes an impersonal possession in the same\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost people who know me would tell you that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nYoughal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often felt inclined to agree with them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Molly; \xe2\x80\x9cand then, now\r\nand again, I think you have a heart tucked away somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to break to you the\r\nfact that I think I\xe2\x80\x99m falling in love with somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMolly McQuade turned sharply to look at her companion, who still fixed\r\nhis gaze on the pheasant run in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re losing your head over somebody useless, someone\r\nwithout money,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could stand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment she feared that Courtenay\xe2\x80\x99s selfishness might have taken\r\nan unexpected turn, in which ambition had given way to the fancy of the\r\nhour; he might be going to sacrifice his Parliamentary career for a life\r\nof stupid lounging in momentarily attractive company.  He quickly\r\nundeceived her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got heaps of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMolly gave a grunt of relief.  Her affection for Courtenay had produced\r\nthe anxiety which underlay her first question; a natural jealousy\r\nprompted the next one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she young and pretty and all that sort of thing, or is she just a\r\ngood sort with a sympathetic manner and nice eyes?  As a rule that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nkind that goes with a lot of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung and quite good-looking in her way, and a distinct style of her\r\nown.  Some people would call her beautiful.  As a political hostess I\r\nshould think she\xe2\x80\x99d be splendid.  I imagine I\xe2\x80\x99m rather in love with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is she in love with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoughal threw back his head with the slight assertive movement that Molly\r\nknew and liked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a girl who I fancy would let judgment influence her a lot.  And\r\nwithout being stupidly conceited, I think I may say she might do worse\r\nthan throw herself away on me.  I\xe2\x80\x99m young and quite good-looking, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nmaking a name for myself in the House; she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to read all sorts\r\nof nice and horrid things about me in the papers at breakfast-time.  I\r\ncan be brilliantly amusing at times, and I understand the value of\r\nsilence; there is no fear that I shall ever degenerate into that fearsome\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94a cheerful talkative husband.  For a girl with money and social\r\nambitions I should think I was rather a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are certainly in love, Courtenay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Molly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s the old\r\nlove and not a new one.  I\xe2\x80\x99m rather glad.  I should have hated to have\r\nyou head-over-heels in love with a pretty woman, even for a short time.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be much happier as it is.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put all my feelings in\r\nthe background, and tell you to go in and win.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to marry a\r\nrich woman, and if she\xe2\x80\x99s nice and will make a good hostess, so much the\r\nbetter for everybody.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll be happier in your married life than I\r\nshall be in mine, when it comes; you\xe2\x80\x99ll have other interests to absorb\r\nyou.  I shall just have the garden and dairy and nursery and lending\r\nlibrary, as like as two peas to all the gardens and dairies and nurseries\r\nfor hundreds of miles round.  You won\xe2\x80\x99t care for your wife enough to be\r\nworried every time she has a finger-ache, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll like her well enough\r\nto be pleased to meet her sometimes at your own house.  I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwonder if you were quite happy.  She will probably be miserable, but any\r\nwoman who married you would be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause; they were both staring at the pheasant cages.\r\nThen Molly spoke again, with the swift nervous tone of a general who is\r\nhurriedly altering the disposition of his forces for a strategic retreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are safely married and honey-mooned and all that sort of thing,\r\nand have put your wife through her paces as a political hostess, some\r\ntime, when the House isn\xe2\x80\x99t sitting, you must come down by yourself, and\r\ndo a little hunting with us.  Will you?  It won\xe2\x80\x99t be quite the same as\r\nold times, but it will be something to look forward to when I\xe2\x80\x99m reading\r\nthe endless paragraphs about your fashionable political wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward pretty far,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9cthe lady may take\r\nyour view as to the probable unhappiness of a future shared with me, and\r\nI may have to content myself with penurious political bachelorhood.\r\nAnyhow, the present is still with us.  We dine at Kettner\xe2\x80\x99s to-night,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Molly, \xe2\x80\x9cthough it will be more or less a throat-lumpy\r\nfeast as far as I am concerned.  We shall have to drink to the health of\r\nthe future Mrs. Youghal.  By the way, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather characteristic of you\r\nthat you haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me who she is, and of me that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked.  And\r\nnow, like a dear boy, trot away and leave me.  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got to say\r\ngood-bye to you yet, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a quiet farewell of the\r\nPheasantry.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some jolly good talks, you and I, sitting on this\r\nseat, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?  And I know, as well as I know anything, that this is\r\nthe last of them.  Eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-night, as punctually as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe watched his retreating figure with eyes that grew slowly misty; he\r\nhad been such a jolly comely boy-friend, and they had had such good times\r\ntogether.  The mist deepened on her lashes as she looked round at the\r\nfamiliar rendezvous where they had so often kept tryst since the day when\r\nthey had first come there together, he a schoolboy and she but lately out\r\nof her teens.  For the moment she felt herself in the thrall of a very\r\nreal sorrow.\r\n\r\nThen, with the admirable energy of one who is only in town for a fleeting\r\nfortnight, she raced away to have tea with a world-faring naval admirer\r\nat his club.  Pluralism is a merciful narcotic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nELAINE DE FREY sat at ease\xe2\x80\x94at bodily ease\xe2\x80\x94at any rate\xe2\x80\x94in a low wicker\r\nchair placed under the shade of a group of cedars in the heart of a\r\nstately spacious garden that had almost made up its mind to be a park.\r\nThe shallow stone basin of an old fountain, on whose wide ledge a\r\nleaden-moulded otter for ever preyed on a leaden salmon, filled a\r\nconspicuous place in the immediate foreground.  Around its rim ran an\r\ninscription in Latin, warning mortal man that time flows as swiftly as\r\nwater and exhorting him to make the most of his hours; after which piece\r\nof Jacobean moralising it set itself shamelessly to beguile all who might\r\npass that way into an abandonment of contemplative repose.  On all sides\r\nof it a stretch of smooth turf spread away, broken up here and there by\r\ngroups of dwarfish chestnut and mulberry trees, whose leaves and branches\r\ncast a laced pattern of shade beneath them.  On one side the lawn sloped\r\ngently down to a small lake, whereon floated a quartette of swans, their\r\nmovements suggestive of a certain mournful listlessness, as though a\r\nweary dignity of caste held them back from the joyous bustling life of\r\nthe lesser waterfowl.  Elaine liked to imagine that they re-embodied the\r\nsouls of unhappy boys who had been forced by family interests to become\r\nhigh ecclesiastical dignitaries and had grown prematurely Right Reverend.\r\nA low stone balustrade fenced part of the shore of the lake, making a\r\nminiature terrace above its level, and here roses grew in a rich\r\nmultitude.  Other rose bushes, carefully pruned and tended, formed little\r\noases of colour and perfume amid the restful green of the sward, and in\r\nthe distance the eye caught the variegated blaze of a many-hued hedge of\r\nrhododendron.  With these favoured exceptions flowers were hard to find\r\nin this well-ordered garden; the misguided tyranny of staring geranium\r\nbeds and beflowered archways leading to nowhere, so dear to the suburban\r\ngardener, found no expression here.  Magnificent Amherst pheasants, whose\r\nplumage challenged and almost shamed the peacock on his own ground,\r\nstepped to and fro over the emerald turf with the assured self-conscious\r\npride of reigning sultans.  It was a garden where summer seemed a\r\npart-proprietor rather than a hurried visitor.\r\n\r\nBy the side of Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s chair under the shadow of the cedars a wicker\r\ntable was set out with the paraphernalia of afternoon tea.  On some\r\ncushions at her feet reclined Courtenay Youghal, smoothly preened and\r\nyouthfully elegant, the personification of decorative repose; equally\r\ndecorative, but with the showy restlessness of a dragonfly, Comus\r\ndisported his flannelled person over a considerable span of the available\r\nforeground.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy existing between the two young men had suffered no immediate\r\ndislocation from the circumstance that they were tacitly paying court to\r\nthe same lady.  It was an intimacy founded not in the least on friendship\r\nor community of tastes and ideas, but owed its existence to the fact that\r\neach was amused and interested by the other.  Youghal found Comus, for\r\nthe time being at any rate, just as amusing and interesting as a rival\r\nfor Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s favour as he had been in the _r\xc3\xb4le_ of scapegrace\r\nboy-about-Town; Comus for his part did not wish to lose touch with\r\nYoughal, who among other attractions possessed the recommendation of\r\nbeing under the ban of Comus\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  She disapproved, it is true, of a\r\ngreat many of her son\xe2\x80\x99s friends and associates, but this particular one\r\nwas a special and persistent source of irritation to her from the fact\r\nthat he figured prominently and more or less successfully in the public\r\nlife of the day.  There was something peculiarly exasperating in reading\r\na brilliant and incisive attack on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s rash handling of\r\npublic expenditure delivered by a young man who encouraged her son in\r\nevery imaginable extravagance.  The actual extent of Youghal\xe2\x80\x99s influence\r\nover the boy was of the slightest; Comus was quite capable of deriving\r\nencouragement to rash outlay and frivolous conversation from an anchorite\r\nor an East-end parson if he had been thrown into close companionship with\r\nsuch an individual.  Francesca, however, exercised a mother\xe2\x80\x99s privilege\r\nin assuming her son\xe2\x80\x99s bachelor associates to be industrious in labouring\r\nto achieve his undoing.  Therefore the young politician was a source of\r\nunconcealed annoyance to her, and in the same degree as she expressed her\r\ndisapproval of him Comus was careful to maintain and parade the intimacy.\r\nIts existence, or rather its continued existence, was one of the things\r\nthat faintly puzzled the young lady whose sought-for favour might have\r\nbeen expected to furnish an occasion for its rapid dissolution.\r\n\r\nWith two suitors, one of whom at least she found markedly attractive,\r\ncourting her at the same moment, Elaine should have had reasonable cause\r\nfor being on good terms with the world, and with herself in particular.\r\nHappiness was not, however, at this auspicious moment, her dominant mood.\r\nThe grave calm of her face masked as usual a certain degree of grave\r\nperturbation.  A succession of well-meaning governesses and a plentiful\r\nsupply of moralising aunts on both sides of her family, had impressed on\r\nher young mind the theoretical fact that wealth is a great\r\nresponsibility.  The consciousness of her responsibility set her\r\ncontinually wondering, not as to her own fitness to discharge her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstewardship,\xe2\x80\x9d but as to the motives and merits of people with whom she\r\ncame in contact.  The knowledge that there was so much in the world that\r\nshe could buy, invited speculation as to how much there was that was\r\nworth buying.  Gradually she had come to regard her mind as a sort of\r\nappeal court before whose secret sittings were examined and judged the\r\nmotives and actions, the motives especially, of the world in general.  In\r\nher schoolroom days she had sat in conscientious judgment on the motives\r\nthat guided or misguided Charles and Cromwell and Monck, Wallenstein and\r\nSavonarola.  In her present stage she was equally occupied in examining\r\nthe political sincerity of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the\r\ngood-faith of a honey-tongued but possibly loyal-hearted waiting-maid,\r\nand the disinterestedness of a whole circle of indulgent and flattering\r\nacquaintances.  Even more absorbing, and in her eyes, more urgently\r\nnecessary, was the task of dissecting and appraising the characters of\r\nthe two young men who were favouring her with their attentions.  And\r\nherein lay cause for much thinking and some perturbation.  Youghal, for\r\nexample, might have baffled a more experienced observer of human nature.\r\nElaine was too clever to confound his dandyism with foppishness or\r\nself-advertisement.  He admired his own toilet effect in a mirror from a\r\ngenuine sense of pleasure in a thing good to look upon, just as he would\r\nfeel a sensuous appreciation of the sight of a well-bred, well-matched,\r\nwell-turned-out pair of horses.  Behind his careful political flippancy\r\nand cynicism one might also detect a certain careless sincerity, which\r\nwould probably in the long run save him from moderate success, and turn\r\nhim into one of the brilliant failures of his day.  Beyond this it was\r\ndifficult to form an exact appreciation of Courtenay Youghal, and Elaine,\r\nwho liked to have her impressions distinctly labelled and pigeon-holed,\r\nwas perpetually scrutinising the outer surface of his characteristics and\r\nutterances, like a baffled art critic vainly searching beneath the\r\nvarnish and scratches of a doubtfully assigned picture for an\r\nenlightening signature.  The young man added to her perplexities by his\r\ndeliberate policy of never trying to show himself in a favourable light\r\neven when most anxious to impart a favourable impression.  He preferred\r\nthat people should hunt for his good qualities, and merely took very good\r\ncare that as far as possible they should never draw blank; even in the\r\nmatter of selfishness, which was the anchor-sheet of his existence, he\r\ncontrived to be noted, and justly noted, for doing remarkably unselfish\r\nthings.  As a ruler he would have been reasonably popular; as a husband\r\nhe would probably be unendurable.\r\n\r\nComus was to a certain extent as great a mystification as Youghal, but\r\nhere Elaine was herself responsible for some of the perplexity which\r\nenshrouded his character in her eyes.  She had taken more than a passing\r\nfancy for the boy\xe2\x80\x94for the boy as he might be, that was to say\xe2\x80\x94and she was\r\ndesperately unwilling to see him and appraise him as he really was.  Thus\r\nthe mental court of appeal was constantly engaged in examining witnesses\r\nas to character, most of whom signally failed to give any testimony which\r\nwould support the favourable judgment which the tribunal was so anxious\r\nto arrive at.  A woman with wider experience of the world\xe2\x80\x99s ways and\r\nshortcomings would probably have contented herself with an endeavour to\r\nfind out whether her liking for the boy outweighed her dislike of his\r\ncharacteristics; Elaine took her judgments too seriously to approach the\r\nmatter from such a simple and convenient standpoint.  The fact that she\r\nwas much more than half in love with Comus made it dreadfully important\r\nthat she should discover him to have a lovable soul, and Comus, it must\r\nbe confessed, did little to help forward the discovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate he is honest,\xe2\x80\x9d she would observe to herself, after some\r\noutspoken admission of unprincipled conduct on his part, and then she\r\nwould ruefully recall certain episodes in which he had figured, from\r\nwhich honesty had been conspicuously absent.  What she tried to label\r\nhonesty in his candour was probably only a cynical defiance of the laws\r\nof right and wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look more than usually thoughtful this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cas if you had invented this summer day and were trying to think out\r\nimprovements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had the power to create improvements anywhere I think I should\r\nbegin with you,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s much better to leave me as I am,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Comus; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlike a relative of mine up in Argyllshire, who spends his time producing\r\nimproved breeds of sheep and pigs and chickens.  So patronising and\r\nirritating to the Almighty I should think, to go about putting superior\r\nfinishing touches to Creation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine frowned, and then laughed, and finally gave a little sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to talk sense to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever else you take in hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must never improve\r\nthis garden.  It\xe2\x80\x99s what our idea of Heaven might be like if the Jews\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t invented one for us on totally different lines.  It\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful\r\nthat we should accept them as the impresarios of our religious dreamland\r\ninstead of the Greeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not very fond of the Jews,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve travelled and lived a good deal in Eastern Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems largely a question of geography,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine; \xe2\x80\x9cin England no\r\none really is anti-Semitic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoughal shook his head.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know a great many Jews who are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nServants had quietly, almost reverently, placed tea and its accessories\r\non the wicker table, and quietly receded from the landscape.  Elaine sat\r\nlike a grave young goddess about to dispense some mysterious potion to\r\nher devotees.  Her mind was still sitting in judgment on the Jewish\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nComus scrambled to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too hot for tea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go and feed the swans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he walked off with a little silver basket-dish containing brown\r\nbread-and-butter.\r\n\r\nElaine laughed quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so like Comus,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto go off with our one dish of\r\nbread-and-butter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoughal chuckled responsively.  It was an undoubted opportunity for him\r\nto put in some disparaging criticism of Comus, and Elaine sat alert in\r\nreadiness to judge the critic and reserve judgment on the criticised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis selfishness is splendid but absolutely futile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\nmy selfishness is commonplace, but always thoroughly practical and\r\ncalculated.  He will have great difficulty in getting the swans to accept\r\nhis offering, and he incurs the odium of reducing us to a\r\nbread-and-butterless condition.  Incidentally he will get very hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine again had the sense of being thoroughly baffled.  If Youghal had\r\nsaid anything unkind it was about himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my cousin Suzette had been here,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, with the shadow of a\r\nmalicious smile on her lips, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe she would have gone into a flood\r\nof tears at the loss of her bread-and-butter, and Comus would have\r\nfigured ever after in her mind as something black and destroying and\r\nhateful.  In fact I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know why we took our loss so\r\nunprotestingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are rather fond of Comus.  And I\xe2\x80\x94am\r\nnot very fond of bread-and-butter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jesting remark brought a throb of pleasure to Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s heart.  She\r\nhad known full well that she cared for Comus, but now that Courtenay\r\nYoughal had openly proclaimed the fact as something unchallenged and\r\nunderstood matters seemed placed at once on a more advanced footing.  The\r\nwarm sunlit garden grew suddenly into a Heaven that held the secret of\r\neternal happiness.  Youth and comeliness would always walk here, under\r\nthe low-boughed mulberry trees, as unchanging as the leaden otter that\r\nfor ever preyed on the leaden salmon on the edge of the old fountain, and\r\nsomehow the lovers would always wear the aspect of herself and the boy\r\nwho was talking to the four white swans by the water steps.  Youghal was\r\nright; this was the real Heaven of one\xe2\x80\x99s dreams and longings,\r\nimmeasurably removed from that Rue de la Paix Paradise about which one\r\nprofessed utterly insincere hankerings in places of public worship.\r\nElaine drank her tea in a happy silence; besides being a brilliant talker\r\nYoughal understood the rarer art of being a non-talker on occasion.\r\n\r\nComus came back across the grass swinging the empty basket-dish in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwans were very pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cand said they hoped I would\r\nkeep the bread-and-butter dish as a souvenir of a happy tea-party.  I may\r\nreally have it, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in an anxious voice; \xe2\x80\x9cit will do\r\nto keep studs and things in.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got the family crest on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine.  Some of the happiness\r\nhad died out of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have that scratched off and my own put on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been in the family for generations,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Elaine, who did not\r\nshare Comus\xe2\x80\x99s view that because you were rich your lesser possessions\r\ncould have no value in your eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want it dreadfully,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, sulkily, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ve heaps of other\r\nthings to put bread-and-butter in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment he was possessed by an overmastering desire to keep the\r\ndish at all costs; a look of greedy determination dominated his face, and\r\nhe had not for an instant relaxed his grip of the coveted object.\r\n\r\nElaine was genuinely angry by this time, and was busily telling herself\r\nthat it was absurd to be put out over such a trifle; at the same moment a\r\nsense of justice was telling her that Comus was displaying a good deal of\r\nrather shabby selfishness.  And somehow her chief anxiety at the moment\r\nwas to keep Courtenay Youghal from seeing that she was angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you don\xe2\x80\x99t really want it, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep it,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted\r\nComus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too hot to argue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy mistress of your destinies,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can suit your\r\ndisputations to the desired time and temperature.  I have to go and\r\nargue, or what is worse, listen to other people\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, in a hot and\r\ndoctored atmosphere suitable to an invalid lizard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t got to argue about a bread-and-butter dish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChiefly about bread-and-butter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9cour great preoccupation\r\nis other people\xe2\x80\x99s bread-and-butter.  They earn or produce the material,\r\nbut we busy ourselves with making rules how it shall be cut up, and the\r\nsize of the slices, and how much butter shall go on how much bread.  That\r\nis what is called legislation.  If we could only make rules as to how the\r\nbread-and-butter should be digested we should be quite happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine had been brought up to regard Parliaments as something to be\r\ntreated with cheerful solemnity, like illness or family re-unions.\r\nYoughal\xe2\x80\x99s flippant disparagement of the career in which he was involved\r\ndid not, however, jar on her susceptibilities.  She knew him to be not\r\nonly a lively and effective debater but an industrious worker on\r\ncommittees.  If he made light of his labours, at least he afforded no one\r\nelse a loophole for doing so.  And certainly, the Parliamentary\r\natmosphere was not inviting on this hot afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen must you go?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, sympathetically.\r\n\r\nYoughal looked ruefully at his watch.  Before he could answer, a cheerful\r\nhoot came through the air, as of an owl joyously challenging the sunlight\r\nwith a foreboding of the coming night.  He sprang laughing to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!  My summons back to my galley,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gods have given\r\nme an hour in this enchanted garden, so I must not complain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen in a lower voice he almost whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Persian debate\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the one hint he had given in the midst of his talking and laughing\r\nthat he was really keenly enthralled in the work that lay before him.  It\r\nwas the one little intimate touch that gave Elaine the knowledge that he\r\ncared for her opinion of his work.\r\n\r\nComus, who had emptied his cigarette-case, became suddenly clamorous at\r\nthe prospect of being temporarily stranded without a smoke.  Youghal took\r\nthe last remaining cigarette from his own case and gravely bisected it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriendship could go no further,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, as he gave one-half to the\r\ndoubtfully appeased Comus, and lit the other himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are heaps more in the hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only done for the Saint Martin of Tours effect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhate smoking when I\xe2\x80\x99m rushing through the air.  Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe departing galley-slave stepped forth into the sunlight, radiant and\r\nconfident.  A few minutes later Elaine could see glimpses of his white\r\ncar as it rushed past the rhododendron bushes.  He woos best who leaves\r\nfirst, particularly if he goes forth to battle or the semblance of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nSomehow Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s garden of Eternal Youth had already become clouded in\r\nits imagery.  The girl-figure who walked in it was still distinctly and\r\nunchangingly herself, but her companion was more blurred and undefined,\r\nas a picture that has been superimposed on another.\r\n\r\nYoughal sped townward well satisfied with himself.  To-morrow, he\r\nreflected, Elaine would read his speech in her morning paper, and he knew\r\nin advance that it was not going to be one of his worst efforts.  He knew\r\nalmost exactly where the punctuations of laughter and applause would\r\nburst in, he knew that nimble fingers in the Press Gallery would be\r\ntaking down each gibe and argument as he flung it at the impassive\r\nMinister confronting him, and that the fair lady of his desire would be\r\nable to judge what manner of young man this was who spent his afternoon\r\nin her garden, lazily chaffing himself and his world.\r\n\r\nAnd he further reflected, with an amused chuckle, that she would be\r\nvividly reminded of Comus for days to come, when she took her afternoon\r\ntea, and saw the bread-and-butter reposing in an unaccustomed dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWARDS four o\xe2\x80\x99clock on a hot afternoon Francesca stepped out from a shop\r\nentrance near the Piccadilly end of Bond Street and ran almost into the\r\narms of Merla Blathlington.  The afternoon seemed to get instantly\r\nhotter.  Merla was one of those human flies that buzz; in crowded\r\nstreets, at bazaars and in warm weather, she attained to the proportions\r\nof a human bluebottle.  Lady Caroline Benaresq had openly predicted that\r\na special fly-paper was being reserved for her accommodation in another\r\nworld; others, however, held the opinion that she would be miraculously\r\nmultiplied in a future state, and that four or more Merla Blathlingtons,\r\naccording to deserts, would be in perpetual and unremitting attendance on\r\neach lost soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a glad eager buzz, \xe2\x80\x9cpopping in and out of\r\nshops like rabbits; not that rabbits do pop in and out of shops very\r\nextensively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was evidently one of her bluebottle days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you love Bond Street?\xe2\x80\x9d she gabbled on.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something so\r\nunusual and distinctive about it; no other street anywhere else is quite\r\nlike it.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know those ikons and images and things scattered up\r\nand down Europe, that are supposed to have been painted or carved, as the\r\ncase may be, by St. Luke or Zaccheus, or somebody of that sort; I always\r\nlike to think that some notable person of those times designed Bond\r\nStreet.  St. Paul, perhaps.  He travelled about a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in Middlesex, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Merla; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen one wanders about as much as\r\nhe did one gets mixed up and forgets where one _has_ been.  I can never\r\nremember whether I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the Tyrol twice and St. Moritz once, or the\r\nother way about; I always have to ask my maid.  And there\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nabout the name Bond that suggests St. Paul; didn\xe2\x80\x99t he write a lot about\r\nthe bond and the free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy he wrote in Hebrew or Greek,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Francesca; \xe2\x80\x9cthe word\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the least resemblance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo dreadfully non-committal to go about pamphleteering in those bizarre\r\nlanguages,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Merla; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what makes all those people so\r\nelusive.  As soon as you try to pin them down to a definite statement\r\nabout anything you\xe2\x80\x99re told that some vitally important word has fifteen\r\nother meanings in the original.  I wonder our Cabinet Ministers and\r\npoliticians don\xe2\x80\x99t adopt a sort of dog-Latin or Esperanto jargon to\r\ndeliver their speeches in; what a lot of subsequent explaining away would\r\nbe saved.  But to go back to Bond Street\xe2\x80\x94not that we\xe2\x80\x99ve left it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I must leave it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca, preparing to turn up\r\nGrafton Street; \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you be going?  Come and have tea somewhere.  I know of a cosy\r\nlittle place where one can talk undisturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca repressed a shudder and pleaded an urgent engagement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know where you\xe2\x80\x99re going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Merla, with the resentful buzz of a\r\nbluebottle that finds itself thwarted by the cold unreasoning resistance\r\nof a windowpane.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to play bridge at Serena Golackly\xe2\x80\x99s.  She\r\nnever asks me to her bridge parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca shuddered openly this time; the prospect of having to play\r\nbridge anywhere in the near neighbourhood of Merla\xe2\x80\x99s voice was not one\r\nthat could be contemplated with ordinary calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she said again firmly, and passed out of earshot; it was\r\nrather like leaving the machinery section of an exhibition.  Merla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiagnosis of her destination had been a correct one; Francesca made her\r\nway slowly through the hot streets in the direction of Serena Golackly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse on the far side of Berkeley Square.  To the blessed certainty of\r\nfinding a game of bridge, she hopefully added the possibility of hearing\r\nsome fragments of news which might prove interesting and enlightening.\r\nAnd of enlightenment on a particular subject, in which she was acutely\r\nand personally interested, she stood in some need.  Comus of late had\r\nbeen provokingly reticent as to his movements and doings; partly,\r\nperhaps, because it was his nature to be provoking, partly because the\r\ndaily bickerings over money matters were gradually choking other forms of\r\nconversation.  Francesca had seen him once or twice in the Park in the\r\ndesirable company of Elaine de Frey, and from time to time she heard of\r\nthe young people as having danced together at various houses; on the\r\nother hand, she had seen and heard quite as much evidence to connect the\r\nheiress\xe2\x80\x99s name with that of Courtenay Youghal.  Beyond this meagre and\r\nconflicting and altogether tantalising information, her knowledge of the\r\npresent position of affairs did not go.  If either of the young men was\r\nseriously \xe2\x80\x9cmaking the running,\xe2\x80\x9d it was probable that she would hear some\r\nsly hint or open comment about it from one of Serena\xe2\x80\x99s gossip-laden\r\nfriends, without having to go out of her way to introduce the subject and\r\nunduly disclose her own state of ignorance.  And a game of bridge, played\r\nfor moderately high points, gave ample excuse for convenient lapses into\r\nreticence; if questions took an embarrassingly inquisitive turn, one\r\ncould always find refuge in a defensive spade.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was too warm to make bridge a generally popular diversion,\r\nand Serena\xe2\x80\x99s party was a comparatively small one.  Only one table was\r\nincomplete when Francesca made her appearance on the scene; at it was\r\nseated Serena herself, confronted by Ada Spelvexit, whom everyone was\r\nwont to explain as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the Cheshire Spelvexits,\xe2\x80\x9d as though any other\r\nvariety would have been intolerable.  Ada Spelvexit was one of those\r\nnaturally stagnant souls who take infinite pleasure in what are called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmovements.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cMost of the really great lessons I have learned have been\r\ntaught me by the Poor,\xe2\x80\x9d was one of her favourite statements.  The one\r\ngreat lesson that the Poor in general would have liked to have taught\r\nher, that their kitchens and sickrooms were not unreservedly at her\r\ndisposal as private lecture halls, she had never been able to assimilate.\r\nShe was ready to give them unlimited advice as to how they should keep\r\nthe wolf from their doors, but in return she claimed and enforced for\r\nherself the penetrating powers of an east wind or a dust storm.  Her\r\nvisits among her wealthier acquaintances were equally extensive and\r\nenterprising, and hardly more welcome; in country-house parties, while\r\npartaking to the fullest extent of the hospitality offered her, she made\r\na practice of unburdening herself of homilies on the evils of leisure and\r\nluxury, which did not particularly endear her to her fellow guests.\r\nHostesses regarded her philosophically as a form of social measles which\r\neveryone had to have once.\r\n\r\nThe third prospective player, Francesca noted without any special\r\nenthusiasm, was Lady Caroline Benaresq.  Lady Caroline was far from being\r\na remarkably good bridge player, but she always managed to domineer\r\nmercilessly over any table that was favoured with her presence, and\r\ngenerally managed to win.  A domineering player usually inflicts the\r\nchief damage and demoralisation on his partner; Lady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s special\r\nachievement was to harass and demoralise partner and opponents alike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeak and weak,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced in her gentle voice, as she cut her\r\nhostess for a partner; \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we had better play only five shillings\r\na hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca wondered at the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s moderate assessment of the stake,\r\nknowing her fondness for highish play and her usual good luck in card\r\nholding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind what we play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ada Spelvexit, with an incautious\r\nparade of elegant indifference; as a matter of fact she was inwardly\r\nrelieved and rejoicing at the reasonable figure proposed by Lady\r\nCaroline, and she would certainly have demurred if a higher stake had\r\nbeen suggested.  She was not as a rule a successful player, and money\r\nlost at cards was always a poignant bereavement to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen as you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it ten shillings a hundred,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady\r\nCaroline, with the pleased chuckle of one who has spread a net in the\r\nsight of a bird and disproved the vanity of the proceeding.\r\n\r\nIt proved a tiresome ding-dong rubber, with the strength of the cards\r\nslightly on Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s side, and the luck of the table going mostly the\r\nother way.  She was too keen a player not to feel a certain absorption in\r\nthe game once it had started, but she was conscious to-day of a\r\ndistracting interest that competed with the momentary importance of leads\r\nand discards and declarations.  The little accumulations of talk that\r\nwere unpent during the dealing of the hands became as noteworthy to her\r\nalert attention as the play of the hands themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite a small party this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Serena, in reply to a\r\nseemingly casual remark on Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s part; \xe2\x80\x9cand two or three\r\nnon-players, which is unusual on a Wednesday.  Canon Besomley was here\r\njust before you came; you know, the big preaching man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to hear him scold the human race once or twice,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFrancesca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strong man with a wonderfully strong message,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ada Spelvexit, in\r\nan impressive and assertive tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sort of popular pulpiteer who spanks the vices of his age and\r\nlunches with them afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly a fair summary of the man and his work,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Ada.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen to hear him many times when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been depressed or discouraged, and\r\nI simply can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the impression his words leave\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least you can tell us what you intend to make trumps,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in Lady\r\nCaroline, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiamonds,\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced Ada, after a rather flurried survey of her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubled,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline, with increased gentleness, and a few\r\nminutes later she was pencilling an addition of twenty-four to her score.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stayed with his people down in Herefordshire last May,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ada,\r\nreturning to the unfinished theme of the Canon; \xe2\x80\x9csuch an exquisite rural\r\nretreat, and so restful and healing to the nerves.  Real country scenery;\r\napple blossom everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely only on the apple trees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nAda Spelvexit gave up the attempt to reproduce the decorative setting of\r\nthe Canon\xe2\x80\x99s homelife, and fell back on the small but practical\r\nconsolation of scoring the odd trick in her opponent\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had led your highest club to start with, instead of the nine, we\r\nshould have saved the trick,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Lady Caroline to her partner in a\r\ntone of coldly, gentle reproof; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no use, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, as\r\nSerena flustered out a halting apology, \xe2\x80\x9cno earthly use to attempt to\r\nplay bridge at one table and try to see and hear what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at two\r\nor three other tables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can generally manage to attend to more than one thing at a time,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSerena, rashly; \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must have a sort of double brain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better to economise and have one really good one,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Lady\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_La belle dame sans merci_ scoring a verbal trick or two as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\na player at another table in a discreet undertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I tell you Sir Edward Roan is coming to my next big evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSerena, hurriedly, by way, perhaps, of restoring herself a little in her\r\nown esteem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear, good Sir Edward.  What have you made trumps?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady\r\nCaroline, in one breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClubs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca; \xe2\x80\x9cand pray, why these adjectives of\r\ncommiseration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca was a Ministerialist by family interest and allegiance, and was\r\ninclined to take up the cudgels at the suggested disparagement aimed at\r\nthe Foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe amuses me so much,\xe2\x80\x9d purred Lady Caroline.  Her amusement was usually\r\nof the sort that a sporting cat derives from watching the Swedish\r\nexercises of a well-spent and carefully thought-out mouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?  He has been rather a brilliant success at the Foreign Office,\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe reminds one so of a circus elephant\xe2\x80\x94infinitely more intelligent than\r\nthe people who direct him, but quite content to go on putting his foot\r\ndown or taking it up as may be required, quite unconcerned whether he\r\nsteps on a meringue or a hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nest in the process of going where he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpected to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you say such things?\xe2\x80\x9d protested Francesca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline; \xe2\x80\x9cCourtenay Youghal said it in the House\r\nlast night.  Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you read the debate?  He was really rather in form.\r\nI disagree entirely with his point of view, of course, but some of the\r\nthings he says have just enough truth behind them to redeem them from\r\nbeing merely smart; for instance, his summing up of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattitude towards our embarrassing Colonial Empire in the wistful phrase\r\n\xe2\x80\x98happy is the country that has no geography.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an absurdly unjust thing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Francesca; \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay some\r\nof our Party at some time have taken up that attitude, but every one\r\nknows that Sir Edward is a sound Imperialist at heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost politicians are something or other at heart, but no one would be\r\nrash enough to insure a politician against heart failure.  Particularly\r\nwhen he happens to be in office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that the Opposition leaders would have acted any\r\ndifferently in the present case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne should always speak guardedly of the Opposition leaders,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady\r\nCaroline, in her gentlest voice; \xe2\x80\x9cone never knows what a turn in the\r\nsituation may do for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean they may one day be at the head of affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Serena,\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean they may one day lead the Opposition.  One never knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Caroline had just remembered that her hostess was on the Opposition\r\nside in politics.\r\n\r\nFrancesca and her partner scored four tricks in clubs; the game stood\r\nirresolutely at twenty-four all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had followed the excellent lyrical advice given to the Maid of\r\nAthens and returned my heart we should have made two more tricks and gone\r\ngame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline to her partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Youghal seems pushing himself to the fore of late,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nFrancesca, as Serena took up the cards to deal.  Since the young\r\npolitician\xe2\x80\x99s name had been introduced into their conversation the\r\nopportunity for turning the talk more directly on him and his affairs was\r\ntoo good to be missed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s got a career before him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Serena; \xe2\x80\x9cthe House always\r\nfills when he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign.  And then he\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\nand got rather an attractive personality, which is always something in\r\nthe political world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis lack of money will handicap him, unless he can find himself a rich\r\nwife or persuade someone to die and leave him a fat legacy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFrancesca; \xe2\x80\x9csince M.P.\xe2\x80\x99s have become the recipients of a salary rather\r\nmore is expected and demanded of them in the expenditure line than\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the House of Commons still remains rather at the opposite pole to\r\nthe Kingdom of Heaven as regards entrance qualifications,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Lady\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ought to be no difficulty about Youghal picking up a girl with\r\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Serena; \xe2\x80\x9cwith his prospects he would make an excellent\r\nhusband for any woman with social ambitions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she half sighed, as though she almost regretted that a previous\r\nmatrimonial arrangement precluded her from entering into the competition\r\non her own account.\r\n\r\nFrancesca, under an assumption of languid interest, was watching Lady\r\nCaroline narrowly for some hint of suppressed knowledge of Youghal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourtship of Miss de Frey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom are you marrying and giving in marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question came from George St. Michael, who had strayed over from a\r\nneighbouring table, attracted by the fragments of small-talk that had\r\nreached his ears.\r\n\r\nSt. Michael was one of those dapper bird-like illusorily-active men, who\r\nseem to have been in a certain stage of middle-age for as long as human\r\nmemory can recall them.  A close-cut peaked beard lent a certain dignity\r\nto his appearance\xe2\x80\x94a loan which the rest of his features and mannerisms\r\nwere continually and successfully repudiating.  His profession, if he had\r\none, was submerged in his hobby, which consisted of being an\r\nadvance-agent for small happenings or possible happenings that were or\r\nseemed imminent in the social world around him; he found a perpetual and\r\nunflagging satisfaction in acquiring and retailing any stray items of\r\ngossip or information, particularly of a matrimonial nature, that chanced\r\nto come his way.  Given the bare outline of an officially announced\r\nengagement he would immediately fill it in with all manner of details,\r\ntrue or, at any rate, probable, drawn from his own imagination or from\r\nsome equally exclusive source.  The _Morning Post_ might content itself\r\nwith the mere statement of the arrangement which would shortly take\r\nplace, but it was St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s breathless little voice that proclaimed\r\nhow the contracting parties had originally met over a salmon-fishing\r\nincident, why the Guards\xe2\x80\x99 Chapel would not be used, why her Aunt Mary had\r\nat first opposed the match, how the question of the children\xe2\x80\x99s religious\r\nupbringing had been compromised, etc., etc., to all whom it might\r\ninterest and to many whom it might not.  Beyond his industriously-earned\r\npre-eminence in this special branch of intelligence, he was chiefly\r\nnoteworthy for having a wife reputed to be the tallest and thinnest woman\r\nin the Home Counties.  The two were sometimes seen together in Society,\r\nwhere they passed under the collective name of St. Michael and All\r\nAngles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are trying to find a rich wife for Courtenay Youghal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Serena,\r\nin answer to St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re a little late,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, glowing with\r\nthe importance of pending revelation; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re a little late,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe repeated, watching the effect of his words as a gardener might watch\r\nthe development of a bed of carefully tended asparagus.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think the\r\nyoung gentleman has been before you and already found himself a rich mate\r\nin prospect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice as he spoke, not with a view to imparting impressive\r\nmystery to his statement, but because there were other table groups\r\nwithin hearing to whom he hoped presently to have the privilege of\r\nre-disclosing his revelation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d began Serena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss de Frey,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in St. Michael, hurriedly, fearful lest his\r\nrevelation should be forestalled, even in guesswork; \xe2\x80\x9cquite an ideal\r\nchoice, the very wife for a man who means to make his mark in politics.\r\nTwenty-four thousand a year, with prospects of more to come, and a\r\ncharming place of her own not too far from town.  Quite the type of girl,\r\ntoo, who will make a good political hostess, brains without being brainy,\r\nyou know.  Just the right thing.  Of course, it would be premature to\r\nmake any definite announcement at present\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would hardly be premature for my partner to announce what she means\r\nto make trumps,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Lady Caroline, in a voice of such sinister\r\ngentleness that St. Michael fled headlong back to his own table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it me?  I beg your pardon.  I leave it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Serena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.  No trumps,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Lady Caroline.  The hand was\r\nsuccessful, and the rubber ultimately fell to her with a comfortable\r\nmargin of honours.  The same partners cut together again, and this time\r\nthe cards went distinctly against Francesca and Ada Spelvexit, and a\r\nheavily piled-up score confronted them at the close of the rubber.\r\nFrancesca was conscious that a certain amount of rather erratic play on\r\nher part had at least contributed to the result.  St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s incursion\r\ninto the conversation had proved rather a powerful distraction to her\r\nordinarily sound bridge-craft.\r\n\r\nAda Spelvexit emptied her purse of several gold pieces and infused a\r\ncorresponding degree of superiority into her manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be going now,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dining early.  I have to give\r\nan address to some charwomen afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady Caroline, with a disconcerting directness that was one\r\nof her most formidable characteristics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I have some things to say to them that I daresay they will\r\nlike to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ada, with a thin laugh.\r\n\r\nHer statement was received with a silence that betokened profound\r\nunbelief in any such probability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go about a good deal among working-class women,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has ever said it,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Lady Caroline, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how painfully\r\ntrue it is that the poor have us always with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAda Spelvexit hastened her departure; the marred impressiveness of her\r\nretreat came as a culminating discomfiture on the top of her ill-fortune\r\nat the card-table.  Possibly, however, the multiplication of her own\r\nannoyances enabled her to survey charwomen\xe2\x80\x99s troubles with increased\r\ncheerfulness.  None of them, at any rate, had spent an afternoon with\r\nLady Caroline.\r\n\r\nFrancesca cut in at another table and with better fortune attending on\r\nher, succeeded in winning back most of her losses.  A sense of\r\nsatisfaction was distinctly dominant as she took leave of her hostess.\r\nSt. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s gossip, or rather the manner in which it had been received,\r\nhad given her a clue to the real state of affairs, which, however slender\r\nand conjectural, at least pointed in the desired direction.  At first she\r\nhad been horribly afraid lest she should be listening to a definite\r\nannouncement which would have been the death-blow to her hopes, but as\r\nthe recitation went on without any of those assured little minor details\r\nwhich St. Michael so loved to supply, she had come to the conclusion that\r\nit was merely a piece of intelligent guesswork.  And if Lady Caroline had\r\nreally believed in the story of Elaine de Frey\xe2\x80\x99s virtual engagement to\r\nCourtenay Youghal she would have taken a malicious pleasure in\r\nencouraging St. Michael in his confidences, and in watching Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscomfiture under the recital.  The irritated manner in which she had\r\ncut short the discussion betrayed the fact, that, as far as the old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s information went, it was Comus and not Courtenay Youghal who held\r\nthe field.  And in this particular case Lady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s information was\r\nlikely to be nearer the truth than St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s confident gossip.\r\n\r\nFrancesca always gave a penny to the first crossing-sweeper or\r\nmatch-seller she chanced across after a successful sitting at bridge.\r\nThis afternoon she had come out of the fray some fifteen shillings to the\r\nbad, but she gave two pennies to a crossing-sweeper at the north-west\r\ncorner of Berkeley Square as a sort of thank-offering to the Gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was a fresh rain-repentant afternoon, following a morning that had\r\nbeen sultry and torrentially wet by turns; the sort of afternoon that\r\nimpels people to talk graciously of the rain as having done a lot of\r\ngood, its chief merit in their eyes probably having been its recognition\r\nof the art of moderation.  Also it was an afternoon that invited bodily\r\nactivity after the convalescent languor of the earlier part of the day.\r\nElaine had instinctively found her way into her riding-habit and sent an\r\norder down to the stables\xe2\x80\x94a blessed oasis that still smelt sweetly of\r\nhorse and hay and cleanliness in a world that reeked of petrol, and now\r\nshe set her mare at a smart pace through a succession of long-stretching\r\ncountry lanes.  She was due some time that afternoon at a garden-party,\r\nbut she rode with determination in an opposite direction.  In the first\r\nplace neither Comus or Courtenay would be at the party, which fact seemed\r\nto remove any valid reason that could be thought of for inviting her\r\nattendance thereat; in the second place about a hundred human beings\r\nwould be gathered there, and human gatherings were not her most crying\r\nneed at the present moment.  Since her last encounter with her wooers,\r\nunder the cedars in her own garden, Elaine realised that she was either\r\nvery happy or cruelly unhappy, she could not quite determine which.  She\r\nseemed to have what she most wanted in the world lying at her feet, and\r\nshe was dreadfully uncertain in her more reflective moments whether she\r\nreally wanted to stretch out her hand and take it.  It was all very like\r\nsome situation in an Arabian Nights tale or a story of Pagan Hellas, and\r\nconsequently the more puzzling and disconcerting to a girl brought up on\r\nthe methodical lines of Victorian Christianity.  Her appeal court was in\r\npermanent session these last few days, but it gave no decisions, at least\r\nnone that she would listen to.  And the ride on her fast light-stepping\r\nlittle mare, alone and unattended, through the fresh-smelling leafy lanes\r\ninto unexplored country, seemed just what she wanted at the moment.  The\r\nmare made some small delicate pretence of being roadshy, not the staring\r\ndolt-like kind of nervousness that shows itself in an irritating\r\nhanging-back as each conspicuous wayside object presents itself, but the\r\nnerve-flutter of an imaginative animal that merely results in a quick\r\nwhisk of the head and a swifter bound forward.  She might have\r\nparaphrased the mental attitude of the immortalised Peter Bell into\r\n\r\n    A basket underneath a tree\r\n    A yellow tiger is to me,\r\n             If it is nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe more really alarming episodes of the road, the hoot and whir of a\r\npassing motor-car or the loud vibrating hum of a wayside\r\nthreshing-machine, were treated with indifference.\r\n\r\nOn turning a corner out of a narrow coppice-bordered lane into a wider\r\nroad that sloped steadily upward in a long stretch of hill Elaine saw,\r\ncoming toward her at no great distance, a string of yellow-painted vans,\r\ndrawn for the most part by skewbald or speckled horses.  A certain rakish\r\nair about these oncoming road-craft proclaimed them as belonging to a\r\ntravelling wild-beast show, decked out in the rich primitive colouring\r\nthat one\xe2\x80\x99s taste in childhood would have insisted on before it had been\r\nschooled in the artistic value of dulness.  It was an unlooked-for and\r\ndistinctly unwelcome encounter.  The mare had already commenced a sixfold\r\nscrutiny with nostrils, eyes and daintily-pricked ears; one ear made\r\nhurried little backward movements to hear what Elaine was saying about\r\nthe eminent niceness and respectability of the approaching caravan, but\r\neven Elaine felt that she would be unable satisfactorily to explain the\r\nelephants and camels that would certainly form part of the procession.\r\nTo turn back would seem rather craven, and the mare might take fright at\r\nthe man\xc5\x93uvre and try to bolt; a gate standing ajar at the entrance to a\r\nfarmyard lane provided a convenient way out of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nAs Elaine pushed her way through she became aware of a man standing just\r\ninside the lane, who made a movement forward to open the gate for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.  I\xe2\x80\x99m just getting out of the way of a wild-beast show,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexplained; \xe2\x80\x9cmy mare is tolerant of motors and traction-engines, but I\r\nexpect camels\xe2\x80\x94hullo,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off, recognising the man as an old\r\nacquaintance, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard you had taken rooms in a farmhouse somewhere.\r\nFancy meeting you in this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the not very distant days of her little-girlhood, Tom Keriway had been\r\na man to be looked upon with a certain awe and envy; indeed the glamour\r\nof his roving career would have fired the imagination, and wistful desire\r\nto do likewise, of many young Englishmen.  It seemed to be the grown-up\r\nrealisation of the games played in dark rooms in winter fire-lit\r\nevenings, and the dreams dreamed over favourite books of adventure.\r\nMaking Vienna his headquarters, almost his home, he had rambled where he\r\nlisted through the lands of the Near and Middle East as leisurely and\r\nthoroughly as tamer souls might explore Paris.  He had wandered through\r\nHungarian horse-fairs, hunted shy crafty beasts on lonely Balkan\r\nhillsides, dropped himself pebble-wise into the stagnant human pool of\r\nsome Bulgarian monastery, threaded his way through the strange racial\r\nmosaic of Salonika, listened with amused politeness to the shallow\r\nultra-modern opinions of a voluble editor or lawyer in some wayside\r\nRussian town, or learned wisdom from a chance tavern companion, one of\r\nthe atoms of the busy ant-stream of men and merchandise that moves\r\nuntiringly round the shores of the Black Sea.  And far and wide as he\r\nmight roam he always managed to turn up at frequent intervals, at ball\r\nand supper and theatre, in the gay Hauptstadt of the Habsburgs, haunting\r\nhis favourite caf\xc3\xa9s and wine-vaults, skimming through his favourite\r\nnews-sheets, greeting old acquaintances and friends, from ambassadors\r\ndown to cobblers in the social scale.  He seldom talked of his travels,\r\nbut it might be said that his travels talked of him; there was an air\r\nabout him that a German diplomat once summed up in a phrase: \xe2\x80\x9ca man that\r\nwolves have sniffed at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then two things happened, which he had not mapped out in his route; a\r\nsevere illness shook half the life and all the energy out of him, and a\r\nheavy money loss brought him almost to the door of destitution.  With\r\nsomething, perhaps, of the impulse which drives a stricken animal away\r\nfrom its kind, Tom Keriway left the haunts where he had known so much\r\nhappiness, and withdrew into the shelter of a secluded farmhouse lodging;\r\nmore than ever he became to Elaine a hearsay personality.  And now the\r\nchance meeting with the caravan had flung her across the threshold of his\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a charming little nook you\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold of,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed with\r\ninstinctive politeness, and then looked searchingly round, and discovered\r\nthat she had spoken the truth; it really was charming.  The farmhouse had\r\nthat intensely English look that one seldom sees out of Normandy.  Over\r\nthe whole scene of rickyard, garden, outbuildings, horsepond and orchard,\r\nbrooded that air which seems rightfully to belong to out-of-the-way\r\nfarmyards, an air of wakeful dreaminess which suggests that here, man and\r\nbeast and bird have got up so early that the rest of the world has never\r\ncaught them up and never will.\r\n\r\nElaine dismounted, and Keriway led the mare round to a little paddock by\r\nthe side of a great grey barn.  At the end of the lane they could see the\r\nshow go past, a string of lumbering vans and great striding beasts that\r\nseemed to link the vast silences of the desert with the noises and sights\r\nand smells, the naphtha-flares and advertisement hoardings and trampled\r\norange-peel, of an endless succession of towns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better let the caravan pass well on its way before you get on\r\nthe road again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keriway; \xe2\x80\x9cthe smell of the beasts may make your\r\nmare nervous and restive going home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he called to a boy who was busy with a hoe among some defiantly\r\nprosperous weeds, to fetch the lady a glass of milk and a piece of\r\ncurrant loaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen anything so utterly charming and peaceful,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Elaine, propping herself on a seat that a pear-tree had obligingly\r\ndesigned in the fantastic curve of its trunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keriway, \xe2\x80\x9cbut too full of the stress of its\r\nown little life struggle to be peaceful.  Since I have lived here I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlearnt, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve always suspected, that a country farmhouse, set away in\r\na world of its own, is one of the most wonderful studies of interwoven\r\nhappenings and tragedies that can be imagined.  It is like the old\r\nchronicles of medieval Europe in the days when there was a sort of\r\nordered anarchy between feudal lords and overlords, and burg-grafs, and\r\nmitred abbots, and prince-bishops, robber barons and merchant guilds, and\r\nElectors and so forth, all striving and contending and counter-plotting,\r\nand interfering with each other under some vague code of loosely-applied\r\nrules.  Here one sees it reproduced under one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, like a musty page\r\nof black-letter come to life.  Look at one little section of it, the\r\npoultry-life on the farm.  Villa poultry, dull egg-machines, with records\r\nkept of how many ounces of food they eat, and how many pennyworths of\r\neggs they lay, give you no idea of the wonder-life of these farm-birds;\r\ntheir feuds and jealousies, and carefully maintained prerogatives, their\r\nunsparing tyrannies and persecutions, their calculated courage and\r\nbravado or sedulously hidden cowardice, it might all be some human\r\nchapter from the annals of the old Rhineland or medieval Italy.  And\r\nthen, outside their own bickering wars and hates, the grim enemies that\r\ncome up against them from the woodlands; the hawk that dashes among the\r\ncoops like a moss-trooper raiding the border, knowing well that a charge\r\nof shot may tear him to bits at any moment.  And the stoat, a creeping\r\nslip of brown fur a few inches long, intently and unstayably out for\r\nblood.  And the hunger-taught master of craft, the red fox, who has\r\nwaited perhaps half the afternoon for his chance while the fowls were\r\ndusting themselves under the hedge, and just as they were turning\r\nsupper-ward to the yard one has stopped a moment to give her feathers a\r\nfinal shake and found death springing upon her.  Do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, as Elaine fed herself and the mare with morsels of\r\ncurrant-loaf, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think any tragedy in literature that I have ever\r\ncome across impressed me so much as the first one, that I spelled out\r\nslowly for myself in words of three letters: the bad fox has got the red\r\nhen.  There was something so dramatically complete about it; the badness\r\nof the fox, added to all the traditional guile of his race, seemed to\r\nheighten the horror of the hen\xe2\x80\x99s fate, and there was such a suggestion of\r\nmasterful malice about the word \xe2\x80\x98got.\xe2\x80\x99  One felt that a countryside in\r\narms would not get that hen away from the bad fox.  They used to think me\r\na slow dull reader for not getting on with my lesson, but I used to sit\r\nand picture to myself the red hen, with its wings beating helplessly,\r\nscreeching in terrified protest, or perhaps, if he had got it by the\r\nneck, with beak wide agape and silent, and eyes staring, as it left the\r\nfarmyard for ever.  I have seen blood-spillings and down-crushings and\r\nabject defeat here and there in my time, but the red hen has remained in\r\nmy mind as the type of helpless tragedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was silent for a moment as\r\nif he were again musing over the three-letter drama that had so dwelt in\r\nhis childhood\xe2\x80\x99s imagination.  \xe2\x80\x9cTell me some of the things you have seen\r\nin your time,\xe2\x80\x9d was the request that was nearly on Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but she\r\nhastily checked herself and substituted another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me more about the farm, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he told her of a whole world, or rather of several intermingled\r\nworlds, set apart in this sleepy hollow in the hills, of beast lore and\r\nwood lore and farm craft, at times touching almost the border of\r\nwitchcraft\xe2\x80\x94passing lightly here, not with the probing eagerness of those\r\nwho know nothing, but with the averted glance of those who fear to see\r\ntoo much.  He told her of those things that slept and those that prowled\r\nwhen the dusk fell, of strange hunting cats, of the yard swine and the\r\nstalled cattle, of the farm folk themselves, as curious and remote in\r\ntheir way, in their ideas and fears and wants and tragedies, as the\r\nbrutes and feathered stock that they tended.  It seemed to Elaine as if a\r\nmusty store of old-world children\xe2\x80\x99s books had been fetched down from some\r\ncobwebbed lumber-room and brought to life.  Sitting there in the little\r\npaddock, grown thickly with tall weeds and rank grasses, and shadowed by\r\nthe weather-beaten old grey barn, listening to this chronicle of\r\nwonderful things, half fanciful, half very real, she could scarcely\r\nbelieve that a few miles away there was a garden-party in full swing,\r\nwith smart frocks and smart conversation, fashionable refreshments and\r\nfashionable music, and a fevered undercurrent of social strivings and\r\nsnubbings.  Did Vienna and the Balkan Mountains and the Black Sea seem as\r\nremote and hard to believe in, she wondered, to the man sitting by her\r\nside, who had discovered or invented this wonderful fairyland?  Was it a\r\ntrue and merciful arrangement of fate and life that the things of the\r\nmoment thrust out the after-taste of the things that had been?  Here was\r\none who had held much that was priceless in the hollow of his hand and\r\nlost it all, and he was happy and absorbed and well-content with the\r\nlittle wayside corner of the world into which he had crept.  And Elaine,\r\nwho held so many desirable things in the hollow of her hand, could not\r\nmake up her mind to be even moderately happy.  She did not even know\r\nwhether to take this hero of her childhood down from his pedestal, or to\r\nplace him on a higher one; on the whole she was inclined to resent rather\r\nthan approve the idea that ill-health and misfortune could so completely\r\nsubdue and tame an erstwhile bold and roving spirit.\r\n\r\nThe mare was showing signs of delicately-hinted impatience; the paddock,\r\nwith its teasing insects and very indifferent grazing, had not thrust out\r\nthe image of her own comfortable well-foddered loose-box.  Elaine\r\ndivested her habit of some remaining crumbs of bun-loaf and jumped\r\nlightly on to her saddle.  As she rode slowly down the lane, with Keriway\r\nescorting her as far as its gate, she looked round at what had seemed to\r\nher, a short while ago, just a picturesque old farmstead, a place of\r\nbee-hives and hollyhocks and gabled cart-sheds; now it was in her eyes a\r\nmagic city, with an undercurrent of reality beneath its magic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a person to be envied,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Keriway; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have created a\r\nfairyland, and you are living in it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnvied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shot the question out with sudden bitterness.  She looked down and saw\r\nthe wistful misery that had come into his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cin a German paper I read a short story about a\r\ntame crippled crane that lived in the park of some small town.  I forget\r\nwhat happened in the story, but there was one line that I shall always\r\nremember: \xe2\x80\x98it was lame, that is why it was tame.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had created a fairyland, but assuredly he was not living in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the warmth of a late June morning the long shaded stretch of raked\r\nearth, gravel-walk and rhododendron bush that is known affectionately as\r\nthe Row was alive with the monotonous movement and alert stagnation\r\nappropriate to the time and place.  The seekers after health, the seekers\r\nafter notoriety and recognition, and the lovers of good exercise were all\r\nwell represented on the galloping ground; the gravel-walk and chairs and\r\nlong seats held a population whose varied instincts and motives would\r\nhave baffled a social catalogue-maker.  The children, handled or in\r\nperambulators, might be excused from instinct or motive; they were\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nPleasingly conspicuous among a bunch of indifferent riders pacing along\r\nby the rails where the onlookers were thickest was Courtenay Youghal, on\r\nhis handsome plum-roan gelding Anne de Joyeuse.  That delicately stepping\r\nanimal had taken a prize at Islington and nearly taken the life of a\r\nstable-boy of whom he disapproved, but his strongest claims to\r\ndistinction were his good looks and his high opinion of himself.  Youghal\r\nevidently believed in thorough accord between horse and rider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease stop and talk to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said a quiet beckoning voice from the other\r\nside of the rails, and Youghal drew rein and greeted Lady Veula Croot.\r\nLady Veula had married into a family of commercial solidity and\r\nenterprising political nonentity.  She had a devoted husband, some blonde\r\nteachable children, and a look of unutterable weariness in her eyes.  To\r\nsee her standing at the top of an expensively horticultured staircase\r\nreceiving her husband\xe2\x80\x99s guests was rather like watching an animal\r\nperforming on a music-hall stage.\r\n\r\nOne always tells oneself that the animal likes it, and one always knows\r\nthat it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Veula is an ardent Free Trader, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d someone once remarked\r\nto Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline, in her gently questioning voice; \xe2\x80\x9ca woman\r\nwhose dresses are made in Paris and whose marriage has been made in\r\nHeaven might be equally biassed for and against free imports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Veula looked at Youghal and his mount with slow critical\r\nappraisement, and there was a note of blended raillery and wistfulness in\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou two dear things, I should love to stroke you both, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure\r\nhow Joyeuse would take it.  So I\xe2\x80\x99ll stroke you down verbally instead.  I\r\nadmired your attack on Sir Edward immensely, though of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nagree with a word of it.  Your description of him building a hedge round\r\nthe German cuckoo and hoping he was isolating it was rather sweet.\r\nSeriously though, I regard him as one of the pillars of the\r\nAdministration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9cthe misfortune is that he is merely propping up\r\na canvas roof.  It\xe2\x80\x99s just his regrettable solidity and integrity that\r\nmakes him so expensively dangerous.  The average Briton arrives at the\r\nsame judgment about Roan\xe2\x80\x99s handling of foreign affairs as Omar does of\r\nthe Supreme Being in his dealings with the world: He\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow and\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twill all be well.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Veula laughed lightly.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy Party is in power so I may exercise the\r\nprivilege of being optimistic.  Who is that who bowed to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, as a dark young man with an inclination to stoutness passed by\r\nthem on foot; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him about a good deal lately.  He\xe2\x80\x99s been to one\r\nor two of my dances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrei Drakoloff,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s just produced a play that has had\r\na big success in Moscow and is certain to be extremely popular all over\r\nRussia.  In the first three acts the heroine is supposed to be dying of\r\nconsumption; in the last act they find she is really dying of cancer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the Russians really such a gloomy people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGloom-loving but not in the least gloomy.  They merely take their\r\nsadness pleasurably, just as we are accused of taking our pleasures\r\nsadly.  Have you noticed that dreadful Klopstock youth has been pounding\r\npast us at shortening intervals.  He\xe2\x80\x99ll come up and talk if he half\r\ncatches your eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only just know him.  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he at an agricultural college or something\r\nof the sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, studying to be a gentleman farmer, he told me.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask if\r\nboth subjects were compulsory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re really rather dreadful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Veula, trying to look as if\r\nshe thought so; \xe2\x80\x9cremember, we are all equal in the sight of Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a preacher of wholesome truths her voice rather lacked conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I and Ernest Klopstock are really equal in the sight of Heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nYoughal, with intense complacency, \xe2\x80\x9cI should recommend Heaven to consult\r\nan eye specialist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a heavy spattering of loose earth, and a squelching of\r\nsaddle-leather, as the Klopstock youth lumbered up to the rails and\r\ndelivered himself of loud, cheerful greetings. Joyeuse laid his ears well\r\nback as the ungainly bay cob and his appropriately matched rider drew up\r\nbeside him; his verdict was reflected and endorsed by the cold stare of\r\nYoughal\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been having a nailing fine time,\xe2\x80\x9d recounted the newcomer with\r\nclamorous enthusiasm; \xe2\x80\x9cI was over in Paris last month and had lots of\r\nstrawberries there, then I had a lot more in London, and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nhaving a late crop of them in Herefordshire, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve had quite a lot this\r\nyear.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he laughed as one who had deserved well and received well of\r\nFate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe charm of that story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal, \xe2\x80\x9cis that it can be told in any\r\ndrawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d  And with a sweep of his wide-brimmed hat to Lady Veula he\r\nturned the impatient Joyeuse into the moving stream of horse and\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman reminds me of some verse I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and liked,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nYoughal, as Joyeuse sprang into a light showy canter that gave full\r\nrecognition to the existence of observant human beings along the side\r\nwalk.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he quoted almost aloud, as one does in the exhilaration of a canter:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHow much I loved that way you had\r\n    Of smiling most, when very sad,\r\n    A smile which carried tender hints\r\n    Of sun and spring,\r\n    And yet, more than all other thing,\r\n    Of weariness beyond all words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd having satisfactorily fitted Lady Veula on to a quotation he\r\ndismissed her from his mind.  With the constancy of her sex she thought\r\nabout him, his good looks and his youth and his railing tongue, till late\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWhile Youghal was putting Joyeuse through his paces under the elm trees\r\nof the Row a little drama in which he was directly interested was being\r\nplayed out not many hundred yards away.  Elaine and Comus were indulging\r\nthemselves in two pennyworths of Park chair, drawn aside just a little\r\nfrom the serried rows of sitters who were set out like bedded plants over\r\nan acre or so of turf.  Comus was, for the moment, in a mood of\r\npugnacious gaiety, disbursing a fund of pointed criticism and unsparing\r\nanecdote concerning those of the promenaders or loungers whom he knew\r\npersonally or by sight.  Elaine was rather quieter than usual, and the\r\ngrave serenity of the Leonardo da Vinci portrait seemed intensified in\r\nher face this morning.  In his leisurely courtship Comus had relied\r\nalmost exclusively on his physical attraction and the fitful drollery of\r\nhis wit and high spirits, and these graces had gone far to make him seem\r\na very desirable and rather lovable thing in Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  But he had\r\nleft out of account the disfavour which he constantly risked and\r\nsometimes incurred from his frank and undisguised indifference to other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s interests and wishes, including, at times, Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s.  And the\r\nmore that she felt that she liked him the more she was irritated by his\r\nlack of consideration for her.  Without expecting that her every wish\r\nshould become a law to him she would at least have liked it to reach the\r\nformality of a Second Reading.  Another important factor he had also left\r\nout of his reckoning, namely the presence on the scene of another suitor,\r\nwho also had youth and wit to recommend him, and who certainly did not\r\nlack physical attractions.  Comus, marching carelessly through unknown\r\ncountry to effect what seemed already an assured victory, made the\r\nmistake of disregarding the existence of an unbeaten army on his flank.\r\n\r\nTo-day Elaine felt that, without having actually quarrelled, she and\r\nComus had drifted a little bit out of sympathy with one another.  The\r\nfault she knew was scarcely hers, in fact from the most good-natured\r\npoint of view it could hardly be denied that it was almost entirely his.\r\nThe incident of the silver dish had lacked even the attraction of\r\nnovelty; it had been one of a series, all bearing a strong connecting\r\nlikeness.  There had been small unrepaid loans which Elaine would not\r\nhave grudged in themselves, though the application for them brought a\r\ncertain qualm of distaste; with the perversity which seemed inseparable\r\nfrom his doings, Comus had always flung away a portion of his borrowings\r\nin some ostentatious piece of glaring and utterly profitless\r\nextravagance, which outraged all the canons of her upbringing without\r\nbringing him an atom of understandable satisfaction.  Under these\r\nrepeated discouragements it was not surprising that some small part of\r\nher affection should have slipped away, but she had come to the Park that\r\nmorning with an unconfessed expectation of being gently wooed back to the\r\nmood of gracious forgetfulness that she was only too eager to assume.  It\r\nwas almost worth while being angry with Comus for the sake of\r\nexperiencing the pleasure of being coaxed into friendliness again with\r\nthe charm which he knew so well how to exert.  It was delicious here\r\nunder the trees on this perfect June morning, and Elaine had the blessed\r\nassurance that most of the women within range were envying her the\r\ncompanionship of the handsome merry-hearted youth who sat by her side.\r\nWith special complacence she contemplated her cousin Suzette, who was\r\nself-consciously but not very elatedly basking in the attentions of her\r\nfianc\xc3\xa9, an earnest-looking young man who was superintendent of a People\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething-or-other on the south side of the river, and whose clothes\r\nComus had described as having been made in Southwark rather than in\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nMost of the pleasures in life must be paid for, and the chair-ticket\r\nvendor in due time made his appearance in quest of pennies.\r\n\r\nComus paid him from out of a varied assortment of coins and then balanced\r\nthe remainder in the palm of his hand.  Elaine felt a sudden\r\nforeknowledge of something disagreeable about to happen and a red spot\r\ndeepened in her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour shillings and fivepence and a half-penny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus,\r\nreflectively.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a ridiculous sum to last me for the next three days,\r\nand I owe a card debt of over two pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d commented Elaine dryly and with an apparent lack of interest in\r\nhis exchequer statement.  Surely, she was thinking hurriedly to herself,\r\nhe could not be foolish enough to broach the matter of another loan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe card debt is rather a nuisance,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Comus, with fatalistic\r\npersistency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won seven pounds last week, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Elaine; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nput by any of your winnings to balance losses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe four shillings and the fivepence and the half-penny represent the\r\nrearguard of the seven pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus; \xe2\x80\x9cthe rest have fallen by the\r\nway.  If I can pay the two pounds to-day I daresay I shall win something\r\nmore to go on with; I\xe2\x80\x99m holding rather good cards just now.  But if I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t pay it of course I shan\xe2\x80\x99t show up at the club.  So you see the fix\r\nI am in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine took no notice of this indirect application.  The Appeal Court was\r\nassembling in haste to consider new evidence, and this time there was the\r\nrapidity of sudden determination about its movement.\r\n\r\nThe conversation strayed away from the fateful topic for a few moments\r\nand then Comus brought it deliberately back to the danger zone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be awfully nice if you would let me have a fiver for a few\r\ndays, Elaine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quickly; \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\r\nshall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are really bothered about your card debt I will send you the two\r\npounds by messenger boy early this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d  She spoke quietly and\r\nwith great decision.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall not be at the Connor\xe2\x80\x99s dance\r\nto-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s too hot for dancing.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going home now;\r\nplease don\xe2\x80\x99t bother to accompany me, I particularly wish to go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComus saw that he had overstepped the mark of her good nature.  Wisely he\r\nmade no immediate attempt to force himself back into her good graces.  He\r\nwould wait till her indignation had cooled.\r\n\r\nHis tactics would have been excellent if he had not forgotten that\r\nunbeaten army on his flank.\r\n\r\nElaine de Frey had known very clearly what qualities she had wanted in\r\nComus, and she had known, against all efforts at self-deception, that he\r\nfell far short of those qualities.  She had been willing to lower her\r\nstandard of moral requirements in proportion as she was fond of the boy,\r\nbut there was a point beyond which she would not go.  He had hurt her\r\npride besides alarming her sense of caution.\r\n\r\nSuzette, on whom she felt a thoroughly justified tendency to look down,\r\nhad at any rate an attentive and considerate lover.  Elaine walked\r\ntowards the Park gates feeling that in one essential Suzette possessed\r\nsomething that had been denied to her, and at the gates she met Joyeuse\r\nand his spruce young rider preparing to turn homeward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet rid of Joyeuse and come and take me out to lunch somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal.  \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go to the Corridor Restaurant.  The\r\nhead waiter there is an old Viennese friend of mine and looks after me\r\nbeautifully.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been there with a lady before, and he\xe2\x80\x99s sure to\r\nask me afterwards, in his fatherly way, if we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lunch was a success in every way.  There was just enough orchestral\r\neffort to immerse the conversation without drowning it, and Youghal was\r\nan attentive and inspired host.  Through an open doorway Elaine could see\r\nthe caf\xc3\xa9 reading-room, with its imposing array of _Neue Freie Presse_,\r\n_Berliner Tageblatt_, and other exotic newspapers hanging on the wall.\r\nShe looked across at the young man seated opposite her, who gave one the\r\nimpression of having centred the most serious efforts of his brain on his\r\ntoilet and his food, and recalled some of the flattering remarks that the\r\npress had bestowed on his recent speeches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it make you conceited, Courtenay,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto look at all\r\nthose foreign newspapers hanging there and know that most of them have\r\ngot paragraphs and articles about your Persian speech?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoughal laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always a chastening corrective in the thought that some of them\r\nmay have printed your portrait.  When once you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen your features\r\nhurriedly reproduced in the _Matin_, for instance, you feel you would\r\nlike to be a veiled Turkish woman for the rest of your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Youghal gazed long and lovingly at his reflection in the nearest\r\nmirror, as an antidote against possible incitements to humility in the\r\nportrait gallery of fame.\r\n\r\nElaine felt a certain soothed satisfaction in the fact that this young\r\nman, whose knowledge of the Middle East was an embarrassment to Ministers\r\nat question time and in debate, was showing himself equally well-informed\r\non the subject of her culinary likes and dislikes.  If Suzette could have\r\nbeen forced to attend as a witness at a neighbouring table she would have\r\nfelt even happier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the head waiter ask if we were engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Elaine, when\r\nCourtenay had settled the bill, and she had finished collecting her\r\nsunshade and gloves and other impedimenta from the hands of obsequious\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Youghal, \xe2\x80\x9cand he seemed quite crestfallen when I had to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98no.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be horrid to disappoint him when he\xe2\x80\x99s looked after us so\r\ncharmingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine; \xe2\x80\x9ctell him that we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Rutland Galleries were crowded, especially in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe tea-buffet, by a fashionable throng of art-patrons which had gathered\r\nto inspect Mervyn Quentock\xe2\x80\x99s collection of Society portraits.  Quentock\r\nwas a young artist whose abilities were just receiving due recognition\r\nfrom the critics; that the recognition was not overdue he owed largely to\r\nhis perception of the fact that if one hides one\xe2\x80\x99s talent under a bushel\r\none must be careful to point out to everyone the exact bushel under which\r\nit is hidden.  There are two manners of receiving recognition: one is to\r\nbe discovered so long after one\xe2\x80\x99s death that one\xe2\x80\x99s grandchildren have to\r\nwrite to the papers to establish their relationship; the other is to be\r\ndiscovered, like the infant Moses, at the very outset of one\xe2\x80\x99s career.\r\nMervyn Quentock had chosen the latter and happier manner.  In an age when\r\nmany aspiring young men strive to advertise their wares by imparting to\r\nthem a freakish imbecility, Quentock turned out work that was\r\ncharacterised by a pleasing delicate restraint, but he contrived to\r\nherald his output with a certain fanfare of personal eccentricity,\r\nthereby compelling an attention which might otherwise have strayed past\r\nhis studio.  In appearance he was the ordinary cleanly young Englishman,\r\nexcept, perhaps, that his eyes rather suggested a library edition of the\r\nArabian Nights; his clothes matched his appearance and showed no taint of\r\nthe sartorial disorder by which the bourgeois of the garden-city and the\r\nLatin Quarter anxiously seeks to proclaim his kinship with art and\r\nthought.  His eccentricity took the form of flying in the face of some of\r\nthe prevailing social currents of the day, but as a reactionary, never as\r\na reformer.  He produced a gasp of admiring astonishment in fashionable\r\ncircles by refusing to paint actresses\xe2\x80\x94except, of course, those who had\r\nleft the legitimate drama to appear between the boards of Debrett.  He\r\nabsolutely declined to execute portraits of Americans unless they hailed\r\nfrom certain favoured States.  His \xe2\x80\x9cwater-colour-line,\xe2\x80\x9d as a New York\r\npaper phrased it, earned for him a crop of angry criticisms and a shoal\r\nof Transatlantic commissions, and criticism and commissions were the\r\nthings that Quentock most wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he is perfectly right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline Benaresq, calmly\r\nrescuing a piled-up plate of caviare sandwiches from the neighbourhood of\r\na trio of young ladies who had established themselves hopefully within\r\neasy reach of it.  \xe2\x80\x9cArt,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, addressing herself to the Rev.\r\nPoltimore Vardon, \xe2\x80\x9chas always been geographically exclusive.  London may\r\nbe more important from most points of view than Venice, but the art of\r\nportrait painting, which would never concern itself with a Lord Mayor,\r\nsimply grovels at the feet of the Doges.  As a Socialist I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to\r\nrecognise the right of Ealing to compare itself with Avignon, but one\r\ncannot expect the Muses to put the two on a level.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExclusiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend Poltimore, \xe2\x80\x9chas been the salvation of\r\nArt, just as the lack of it is proving the downfall of religion.  My\r\ncolleagues of the cloth go about zealously proclaiming the fact that\r\nChristianity, in some form or other, is attracting shoals of converts\r\namong all sorts of races and tribes, that one had scarcely ever heard of,\r\nexcept in reviews of books of travel that one never read.  That sort of\r\nthing was all very well when the world was more sparsely populated, but\r\nnowadays, when it simply teems with human beings, no one is particularly\r\nimpressed by the fact that a few million, more or less, of converts, of a\r\nlow stage of mental development, have accepted the teachings of some\r\nparticular religion.  It not only chills one\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm, it positively\r\nshakes one\xe2\x80\x99s convictions when one hears that the things one has been\r\nbrought up to believe as true are being very favourably spoken of by\r\nBuriats and Samoyeds and Kanakas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Poltimore Vardon had once seen a resemblance in himself to\r\nVoltaire, and had lived alongside the comparison ever since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo modern cult or fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be favourably\r\ninfluenced by considerations based on statistics; fancy adopting a\r\ncertain style of hat or cut of coat, because it was being largely worn in\r\nLancashire and the Midlands; fancy favouring a certain brand of champagne\r\nbecause it was being extensively patronised in German summer resorts.  No\r\nwonder that religion is falling into disuse in this country under such\r\nill-directed methods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent the heathen being converted if they choose to be,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Lady Caroline; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is an age of toleration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could always deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rev. Poltimore, \xe2\x80\x9clike the Belgians\r\ndo with regrettable occurrences in the Congo.  But I would go further\r\nthan that.  I would stimulate the waning enthusiasm for Christianity in\r\nthis country by labelling it as the exclusive possession of a privileged\r\nfew.  If one could induce the Duchess of Pelm, for instance, to assert\r\nthat the Kingdom of Heaven, as far as the British Isles are concerned, is\r\nstrictly limited to herself, two of the under-gardeners at Pelmby, and,\r\npossibly, but not certainly, the Dean of Dunster, there would be an\r\ninstant reshaping of the popular attitude towards religious convictions\r\nand observances.  Once let the idea get about that the Christian Church\r\nis rather more exclusive than the Lawn at Ascot, and you would have a\r\nquickening of religious life such as this generation has never witnessed.\r\nBut as long as the clergy and the religious organisations advertise their\r\ncreed on the lines of \xe2\x80\x98Everybody ought to believe in us: millions do,\xe2\x80\x99\r\none can expect nothing but indifference and waning faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime is just as exclusive in its way as Art,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend Poltimore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pleasantries about religion would have sounded quite clever and\r\nadvanced in the early \xe2\x80\x99nineties.  To-day they have a dreadfully warmed-up\r\nflavour.  That is the great delusion of you would-be advanced satirists;\r\nyou imagine you can sit down comfortably for a couple of decades saying\r\ndaring and startling things about the age you live in, which, whatever\r\nother defects it may have, is certainly not standing still.  The whole of\r\nthe Sherard Blaw school of discursive drama suggests, to my mind, Early\r\nVictorian furniture in a travelling circus.  However, you will always\r\nhave relays of people from the suburbs to listen to the Mocking Bird of\r\nyesterday, and sincerely imagine it is the harbinger of something new and\r\nrevolutionising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Would_ you mind passing that plate of sandwiches,\xe2\x80\x9d asked one of the\r\ntrio of young ladies, emboldened by famine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline, deftly passing her a nearly empty\r\nplate of bread-and-butter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant the place of caviare sandwiches.  So sorry to trouble you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npersisted the young lady.\r\n\r\nHer sorrow was misapplied; Lady Caroline had turned her attention to a\r\nnewcomer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very interesting exhibition,\xe2\x80\x9d Ada Spelvexit was saying; \xe2\x80\x9cfaultless\r\ntechnique, as far as I am a judge of technique, and quite a master-touch\r\nin the way of poses.  But have you noticed how very animal his art is?\r\nHe seems to shut out the soul from his portraits.  I nearly cried when I\r\nsaw dear Winifred depicted simply as a good-looking healthy blonde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline; \xe2\x80\x9cthe spectacle of a strong, brave\r\nwoman weeping at a private view in the Rutland Galleries would have been\r\nso sensational.  It would certainly have been reproduced in the next\r\nDrury Lane drama.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m so unlucky; I never see these sensational\r\nevents.  I was ill with appendicitis, you know, when Lulu Braminguard\r\ndramatically forgave her husband, after seventeen years of estrangement,\r\nduring a State luncheon party at Windsor.  The old queen was furious\r\nabout it.  She said it was so disrespectful to the cook to be thinking of\r\nsuch a thing at such a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s recollections of things that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened at the Court\r\nof Queen Victoria were notoriously vivid; it was the very widespread fear\r\nthat she might one day write a book of reminiscences that made her so\r\nuniversally respected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for his full-length picture of Lady Brickfield,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ada,\r\nignoring Lady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s commentary as far as possible, \xe2\x80\x9call the\r\nexpression seems to have been deliberately concentrated in the feet;\r\nbeautiful feet, no doubt, but still, hardly the most distinctive part of\r\na human being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo paint the right people at the wrong end may be an eccentricity, but\r\nit is scarcely an indiscretion,\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nOne of the portraits which attracted more than a passing flutter of\r\nattention was a costume study of Francesca Bassington.  Francesca had\r\nsecured some highly desirable patronage for the young artist, and in\r\nreturn he had enriched her pantheon of personal possessions with a clever\r\npiece of work into which he had thrown an unusual amount of imaginative\r\ndetail.  He had painted her in a costume of the great Louis\xe2\x80\x99s brightest\r\nperiod, seated in front of a tapestry that was so prominent in the\r\ncomposition that it could scarcely be said to form part of the\r\nbackground.  Flowers and fruit, in exotic profusion, were its dominant\r\nnote; quinces, pomegranates, passion-flowers, giant convolvulus, great\r\nmauve-pink roses, and grapes that were already being pressed by gleeful\r\ncupids in a riotous Arcadian vintage, stood out on its woven texture.\r\nThe same note was struck in the beflowered satin of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s kirtle,\r\nand in the pomegranate pattern of the brocade that draped the couch on\r\nwhich she was seated.  The artist had called his picture \xe2\x80\x9cRecolte.\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nafter one had taken in all the details of fruit and flower and foliage\r\nthat earned the composition its name, one noted the landscape that showed\r\nthrough a broad casement in the left-hand corner.  It was a landscape\r\nclutched in the grip of winter, naked, bleak, black-frozen; a winter in\r\nwhich things died and knew no rewakening.  If the picture typified\r\nharvest, it was a harvest of artificial growth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt leaves a great deal to the imagination, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ada\r\nSpelvexit, who had edged away from the range of Lady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate one can tell who it\xe2\x80\x99s meant for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Serena Golackly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good likeness of dear Francesca,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Ada; \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\ncourse, it flatters her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, too, is a fault on the right side in portrait painting,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSerena; \xe2\x80\x9cafter all, if posterity is going to stare at one for centuries\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s only kind and reasonable to be looking just a little better than\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a curiously unequal style the artist has,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ada, almost as\r\nif she felt a personal grievance against him; \xe2\x80\x9cI was just noticing what a\r\nlack of soul there was in most of his portraits.  Dear Winifred, you\r\nknow, who speaks so beautifully and feelingly at my gatherings for old\r\nwomen, he\xe2\x80\x99s made her look just an ordinary dairy-maidish blonde; and\r\nFrancesca, who is quite the most soulless woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiven her quite\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Serena, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bassington boy is just behind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComus stood looking at the portrait of his mother with the feeling of one\r\nwho comes suddenly across a once-familiar half-forgotten acquaintance in\r\nunfamiliar surroundings.  The likeness was undoubtedly a good one, but\r\nthe artist had caught an expression in Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s eyes which few people\r\nhad ever seen there.  It was the expression of a woman who had forgotten\r\nfor one short moment to be absorbed in the small cares and excitements of\r\nher life, the money worries and little social plannings, and had found\r\ntime to send a look of half-wistful friendliness to some sympathetic\r\ncompanion.  Comus could recall that look, fitful and fleeting, in his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when she had been a few years younger, before her world had\r\ngrown to be such a committee-room of ways and means.  Almost as a\r\nre-discovery he remembered that she had once figured in his boyish mind\r\nas a \xe2\x80\x9crather good sort,\xe2\x80\x9d more ready to see the laughable side of a piece\r\nof mischief than to labour forth a reproof.  That the bygone feeling of\r\ngood fellowship had been stamped out was, he knew, probably in great part\r\nhis own doing, and it was possible that the old friendliness was still\r\nthere under the surface of things, ready to show itself again if he\r\nwilled it, and friends were becoming scarcer with him than enemies in\r\nthese days.  Looking at the picture with its wistful hint of a long ago\r\ncomradeship, Comus made up his mind that he very much wanted things to be\r\nback on their earlier footing, and to see again on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s face the\r\nlook that the artist had caught and perpetuated in its momentary\r\nflitting.  If the projected Elaine-marriage came off, and in spite of\r\nrecent maladroit behaviour on his part he still counted it an assured\r\nthing, much of the immediate cause for estrangement between himself and\r\nhis mother would be removed, or at any rate, easily removable.  With the\r\ninfluence of Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s money behind him he promised himself that he would\r\nfind some occupation that would remove from himself the reproach of being\r\na waster and idler.  There were lots of careers, he told himself, that\r\nwere open to a man with solid financial backing and good connections.\r\nThere might yet be jolly times ahead, in which his mother would have her\r\nshare of the good things that were going, and carking thin-lipped Henry\r\nGreech and other of Comus\xe2\x80\x99s detractors could take their sour looks and\r\nwords out of sight and hearing.  Thus, staring at the picture as though\r\nhe were studying its every detail, and seeing really only that wistful\r\nfriendly smile, Comus made his plans and dispositions for a battle that\r\nwas already fought and lost.\r\n\r\nThe crowd grew thicker in the galleries, cheerfully enduring an amount of\r\novercrowding that would have been fiercely resented in a railway\r\ncarriage.  Near the entrance Mervyn Quentock was talking to a Serene\r\nHighness, a lady who led a life of obtrusive usefulness, largely imposed\r\non her by a good-natured inability to say \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThat woman creates a\r\npositive draught with the number of bazaars she opens,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nfrivolously-spoken ex-Cabinet Minister had once remarked.  At the present\r\nmoment she was being whimsically apologetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think of the legions of well-meaning young men and women to whom\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve given away prizes for proficiency in art-school curriculum, I feel\r\nthat I ought not to show my face inside a picture gallery.  I always\r\nimagine that my punishment in another world will be perpetually\r\nsharpening pencils and cleaning palettes for unending relays of misguided\r\nyoung people whom I deliberately encouraged in their artistic delusions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose we shall all get appropriate punishments in another world\r\nfor our sins in this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Quentock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much for our sins as for our indiscretions; they are the things\r\nwhich do the most harm and cause the greatest trouble.  I feel certain\r\nthat Christopher Columbus will undergo the endless torment of being\r\ndiscovered by parties of American tourists.  You see I am quite old\r\nfashioned in my ideas about the terrors and inconveniences of the next\r\nworld.  And now I must be running away; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to open a Free Library\r\nsomewhere.  You know the sort of thing that happens\xe2\x80\x94one unveils a bust of\r\nCarlyle and makes a speech about Ruskin, and then people come in their\r\nthousands and read \xe2\x80\x98Rabid Ralph, or Should he have Bitten Her?\xe2\x80\x99  Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget, please, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have the medallion with the fat cupid\r\nsitting on a sundial.  And just one thing more\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I ought not to ask\r\nyou, but you have such nice kind eyes, you embolden one to make daring\r\nrequests, would you send me the recipe for those lovely\r\nchestnut-and-chicken-liver sandwiches?  I know the ingredients of course,\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s the proportions that make such a difference\xe2\x80\x94just how much liver\r\nto how much chestnut, and what amount of red pepper and other things.\r\nThank you so much.  I really am going now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStaring round with a vague half-smile at everybody within nodding\r\ndistance, Her Serene Highness made one of her characteristic exits, which\r\nLady Caroline declared always reminded her of a scrambled egg slipping\r\noff a piece of toast.  At the entrance she stopped for a moment to\r\nexchange a word or two with a young man who had just arrived.  From a\r\ncorner where he was momentarily hemmed in by a group of tea-consuming\r\ndowagers, Comus recognised the newcomer as Courtenay Youghal, and began\r\nslowly to labour his way towards him.  Youghal was not at the moment the\r\nperson whose society he most craved for in the world, but there was at\r\nleast the possibility that he might provide an opportunity for a game of\r\nbridge, which was the dominant desire of the moment.  The young\r\npolitician was already surrounded by a group of friends and\r\nacquaintances, and was evidently being made the recipient of a salvo of\r\ncongratulation\xe2\x80\x94presumably on his recent performances in the Foreign\r\nOffice debate, Comus concluded.  But Youghal himself seemed to be\r\nannouncing the event with which the congratulations were connected.  Had\r\nsome dramatic catastrophe overtaken the Government, Comus wondered.  And\r\nthen, as he pressed nearer, a chance word, the coupling of two names,\r\ntold him the news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the momentous lunch at the Corridor Restaurant Elaine had returned\r\nto Manchester Square (where she was staying with one of her numerous\r\naunts) in a frame of mind that embraced a tangle of competing emotions.\r\nIn the first place she was conscious of a dominant feeling of relief; in\r\na moment of impetuosity, not wholly uninfluenced by pique, she had\r\nsettled the problem which hours of hard thinking and serious\r\nheart-searching had brought no nearer to solution, and, although she felt\r\njust a little inclined to be scared at the headlong manner of her final\r\ndecision, she had now very little doubt in her own mind that the decision\r\nhad been the right one.  In fact the wonder seemed rather that she should\r\nhave been so long in doubt as to which of her wooers really enjoyed her\r\nhonest approval.  She had been in love, these many weeks past with an\r\nimaginary Comus, but now that she had definitely walked out of her\r\ndreamland she saw that nearly all the qualities that had appealed to her\r\non his behalf had been absent from, or only fitfully present in, the\r\ncharacter of the real Comus.  And now that she had installed Youghal in\r\nthe first place of her affections he had rapidly acquired in her eyes\r\nsome of the qualities which ranked highest in her estimation.  Like the\r\nproverbial buyer she had the happy feminine tendency of magnifying the\r\nworth of her possession as soon as she had acquired it.  And Courtenay\r\nYoughal gave Elaine some justification for her sense of having chosen\r\nwisely.  Above all other things, selfish and cynical though he might\r\nappear at times, he was unfailingly courteous and considerate towards\r\nher.  That was a circumstance which would always have carried weight with\r\nher in judging any man; in this case its value was enormously heightened\r\nby contrast with the behaviour of her other wooer.  And Youghal had in\r\nher eyes the advantage which the glamour of combat, even the combat of\r\nwords and wire-pulling, throws over the fighter.  He stood well in the\r\nforefront of a battle which however carefully stage-managed, however\r\nhoneycombed with personal insincerities and overlaid with calculated\r\nmock-heroics, really meant something, really counted for good or wrong in\r\nthe nation\xe2\x80\x99s development and the world\xe2\x80\x99s history.  Shrewd parliamentary\r\nobservers might have warned her that Youghal would never stand much\r\nhigher in the political world than he did at present, as a brilliant\r\nOpposition freelance, leading lively and rather meaningless forays\r\nagainst the dull and rather purposeless foreign policy of a Government\r\nthat was scarcely either to be blamed for or congratulated on its\r\nhandling of foreign affairs.  The young politician had not the strength\r\nof character or convictions that keeps a man naturally in the forefront\r\nof affairs and gives his counsels a sterling value, and on the other hand\r\nhis insincerity was not deep enough to allow him to pose artificially and\r\nsuccessfully as a leader of men and shaper of movements.  For the moment,\r\nhowever, his place in public life was sufficiently marked out to give him\r\na secure footing in that world where people are counted individually and\r\nnot in herds.  The woman whom he would make his wife would have the\r\nchance, too, if she had the will and the skill, to become an individual\r\nwho counted.\r\n\r\nThere was balm to Elaine in this reflection, yet it did not wholly\r\nsuffice to drive out the feeling of pique which Comus had called into\r\nbeing by his slighting view of her as a convenient cash supply in moments\r\nof emergency.  She found a certain satisfaction in scrupulously observing\r\nher promise, made earlier on that eventful day, and sent off a messenger\r\nwith the stipulated loan.  Then a reaction of compunction set in, and she\r\nreminded herself that in fairness she ought to write and tell her news in\r\nas friendly a fashion as possible to her dismissed suitor before it burst\r\nupon him from some other quarter.  They had parted on more or less\r\nquarrelling terms it was true, but neither of them had foreseen the\r\nfinality of the parting nor the permanence of the breach between them;\r\nComus might even now be thinking himself half-forgiven, and the awakening\r\nwould be rather cruel.  The letter, however, did not prove an easy one to\r\nwrite; not only did it present difficulties of its own but it suffered\r\nfrom the competing urgency of a desire to be doing something far\r\npleasanter than writing explanatory and valedictory phrases.  Elaine was\r\npossessed with an unusual but quite overmastering hankering to visit her\r\ncousin Suzette Brankley.  They met but rarely at each other\xe2\x80\x99s houses and\r\nvery seldom anywhere else, and Elaine for her part was never conscious of\r\nfeeling that their opportunities for intercourse lacked anything in the\r\nway of adequacy.  Suzette accorded her just that touch of patronage which\r\na moderately well-off and immoderately dull girl will usually try to mete\r\nout to an acquaintance who is known to be wealthy and suspected of\r\npossessing brains.  In return Elaine armed herself with that particular\r\nbrand of mock humility which can be so terribly disconcerting if properly\r\nwielded.  No quarrel of any description stood between them and one could\r\nnot legitimately have described them as enemies, but they never disarmed\r\nin one another\xe2\x80\x99s presence.  A misfortune of any magnitude falling on one\r\nof them would have been sincerely regretted by the other, but any minor\r\ndiscomfiture would have produced a feeling very much akin to\r\nsatisfaction.  Human nature knows millions of these inconsequent little\r\nfeuds, springing up and flourishing apart from any basis of racial,\r\npolitical, religious or economic causes, as a hint perhaps to crass\r\nunseeing altruists that enmity has its place and purpose in the world as\r\nwell as benevolence.\r\n\r\nElaine had not personally congratulated Suzette since the formal\r\nannouncement of her engagement to the young man with the dissentient\r\ntailoring effects.  The impulse to go and do so now, overmastered her\r\nsense of what was due to Comus in the way of explanation.  The letter was\r\nstill in its blank unwritten stage, an unmarshalled sequence of sentences\r\nforming in her brain, when she ordered her car and made a hurried but\r\nwell-thought-out change into her most sumptuously sober afternoon\r\ntoilette.  Suzette, she felt tolerably sure, would still be in the\r\ncostume that she had worn in the Park that morning, a costume that aimed\r\nat elaboration of detail, and was damned with overmuch success.\r\n\r\nSuzette\xe2\x80\x99s mother welcomed her unexpected visitor with obvious\r\nsatisfaction.  Her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s engagement, she explained, was not so\r\nbrilliant from the social point of view as a girl of Suzette\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattractions and advantages might have legitimately aspired to, but Egbert\r\nwas a thoroughly commendable and dependable young man, who would very\r\nprobably win his way before long to membership of the County Council.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom there, of course, the road would be open to him to higher things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine, \xe2\x80\x9che might become an alderman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen their photographs, taken together?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Brankley,\r\nabandoning the subject of Egbert\xe2\x80\x99s prospective career.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, do show me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine, with a flattering show of interest; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever seen that sort of thing before.  It used to be the fashion once for\r\nengaged couples to be photographed together, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _very_ much the fashion now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brankley assertively, but\r\nsome of the complacency had filtered out of her voice.  Suzette came into\r\nthe room, wearing the dress that she had worn in the Park that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing all about _the_ engagement from mother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried, and then set to work conscientiously to cover the same ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe met at Grindelwald, you know.  He always calls me his Ice Maiden\r\nbecause we first got to know each other on the skating rink.  Quite\r\nromantic, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  Then we asked him to tea one day, and we got to be\r\nquite friendly.  Then he proposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one who was smitten with Suzette,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brankley\r\nhastened to put in, fearful lest Elaine might suppose that Egbert had had\r\nthings all his own way.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere was an American millionaire who was quite\r\ntaken with her, and a Polish count of a very old family.  I assure you I\r\nfelt quite nervous at some of our tea-parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brankley had given Grindelwald a sinister but rather alluring\r\nreputation among a large circle of untravelled friends as a place where\r\nthe insolence of birth and wealth was held in precarious check from\r\nbreaking forth into scenes of savage violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy marriage with Egbert will, of course, enlarge the sphere of my life\r\nenormously,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Suzette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine; her eyes were rather remorselessly taking in the\r\ndetails of her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s toilette.  It is said that nothing is sadder than\r\nvictory except defeat.  Suzette began to feel that the tragedy of both\r\nwas concentrated in the creation which had given her such unalloyed\r\ngratification, till Elaine had come on the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman can be so immensely helpful in the social way to a man who is\r\nmaking a career for himself.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad to find that we\xe2\x80\x99ve a great\r\nmany ideas in common.  We each made out a list of our idea of the hundred\r\nbest books, and quite a number of them were the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks bookish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine, with a critical glance at the\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s not at all a bookworm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzette quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cthough he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntremendously well-read.  He\xe2\x80\x99s quite the man of action.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he hunt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much time or opportunity for riding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Elaine; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could marry a man who\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t fond of riding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzette, stiffly; \xe2\x80\x9chorsey men\r\nare not usually gifted with overmuch brains, are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is as much difference between a horseman and a horsey man as there\r\nis between a well-dressed man and a dressy one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine, judicially;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you may have noticed how seldom a dressy woman really knows how to\r\ndress.  As an old lady of my acquaintance observed the other day, some\r\npeople are born with a sense of how to clothe themselves, others acquire\r\nit, others look as if their clothes had been thrust upon them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave Lady Caroline her due quotation marks, but the sudden\r\ntactfulness with which she looked away from her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s frock was\r\nentirely her own idea.\r\n\r\nA young man entering the room at this moment caused a diversion that was\r\nrather welcome to Suzette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes Egbert,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced, with an air of subdued triumph; it\r\nwas at least a satisfaction to be able to produce the captive of her\r\ncharms, alive and in good condition, on the scene.  Elaine might be as\r\ncritical as she pleased, but a live lover outweighed any number of\r\nwell-dressed straight-riding cavaliers who existed only as a distant\r\nvision of the delectable husband.\r\n\r\nEgbert was one of those men who have no small talk, but possess an\r\ninexhaustible supply of the larger variety.  In whatever society he\r\nhappened to be, and particularly in the immediate neighbourhood of an\r\nafternoon-tea table, with a limited audience of womenfolk, he gave the\r\nimpression of someone who was addressing a public meeting, and would be\r\nhappy to answer questions afterwards.  A suggestion of gas-lit\r\nmission-halls, wet umbrellas, and discreet applause seemed to accompany\r\nhim everywhere.  He was an exponent, among other things, of what he\r\ncalled New Thought, which seemed to lend itself conveniently to the\r\nemployment of a good deal of rather stale phraseology.  Probably in the\r\ncourse of some thirty odd years of existence he had never been of any\r\nnotable use to man, woman, child or animal, but it was his\r\nfirmly-announced intention to leave the world a better, happier, purer\r\nplace than he had found it; against the danger of any relapse to earlier\r\nconditions after his disappearance from the scene, he was, of course,\r\npowerless to guard.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis not in mortals to insure succession, and Egbert\r\nwas admittedly mortal.\r\n\r\nElaine found him immensely entertaining, and would certainly have exerted\r\nherself to draw him out if such a proceeding had been at all necessary.\r\nShe listened to his conversation with the complacent appreciation that\r\none bestows on a stage tragedy, from whose calamities one can escape at\r\nany moment by the simple process of leaving one\xe2\x80\x99s seat.  When at last he\r\nchecked the flow of his opinions by a hurried reference to his watch, and\r\ndeclared that he must be moving on elsewhere, Elaine almost expected a\r\nvote of thanks to be accorded him, or to be asked to signify herself in\r\nfavour of some resolution by holding up her hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man had bidden the company a rapid business-like farewell,\r\ntempered in Suzette\xe2\x80\x99s case by the exact degree of tender intimacy that it\r\nwould have been considered improper to omit or overstep, Elaine turned to\r\nher expectant cousin with an air of cordial congratulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is exactly the husband I should have chosen for you, Suzette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the second time that afternoon Suzette felt a sense of waning\r\nenthusiasm for one of her possessions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brankley detected the note of ironical congratulation in her\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she means he\xe2\x80\x99s not her idea of a husband, but, he\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nenough for Suzette,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed to herself, with a snort that expressed\r\nitself somewhere in the nostrils of the brain.  Then with a smiling air\r\nof heavy patronage she delivered herself of her one idea of a damaging\r\ncounter-stroke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when are we to hear of your engagement, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine quietly, but with electrical effect; \xe2\x80\x9cI came to\r\nannounce it to you but I wanted to hear all about Suzette first.  It will\r\nbe formally announced in the papers in a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is it?  Is it the young man who was with you in the Park this\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Suzette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see, who was I with in the Park this morning?  A very\r\ngood-looking dark boy?  Oh no, not Comus Bassington.  Someone you know by\r\nname, anyway, and I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen his portrait in the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA flying-man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Brankley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourtenay Youghal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brankley and Suzette had often rehearsed in the privacy of their\r\nminds the occasion when Elaine should come to pay her personal\r\ncongratulations to her engaged cousin.  It had never been in the least\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nOn her return from her enjoyable afternoon visit Elaine found an express\r\nmessenger letter waiting for her.  It was from Comus, thanking her for\r\nher loan\xe2\x80\x94and returning it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I ought never to have asked you for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nare always so deliciously solemn about money matters that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nresist.  Just heard the news of your engagement to Courtenay.  Congrats.\r\nto you both.  I\xe2\x80\x99m far too stoney broke to buy you a wedding present so\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you back the bread-and-butter dish.  Luckily it still\r\nhas your crest on it.  I shall love to think of you and Courtenay eating\r\nbread-and-butter out of it for the rest of your lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was all he had to say on the matter about which Elaine had been\r\npreparing to write a long and kindly-expressed letter, closing a rather\r\nmomentous chapter in her life and his.  There was not a trace of regret\r\nor upbraiding in his note; he had walked out of their mutual fairyland as\r\nabruptly as she had, and to all appearances far more unconcernedly.\r\nReading the letter again and again Elaine could come to no decision as to\r\nwhether this was merely a courageous gibe at defeat, or whether it\r\nrepresented the real value that Comus set on the thing that he had lost.\r\n\r\nAnd she would never know.  If Comus possessed one useless gift to\r\nperfection it was the gift of laughing at Fate even when it had struck\r\nhim hardest.  One day, perhaps, the laughter and mockery would be silent\r\non his lips, and Fate would have the advantage of laughing last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nA DOOR closed and Francesca Bassington sat alone in her well-beloved\r\ndrawing-room.  The visitor who had been enjoying the hospitality of her\r\nafternoon-tea table had just taken his departure.  The t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate had\r\nnot been a pleasant one, at any rate as far as Francesca was concerned,\r\nbut at least it had brought her the information for which she had been\r\nseeking.  Her r\xc3\xb4le of looker-on from a tactful distance had necessarily\r\nleft her much in the dark concerning the progress of the all-important\r\nwooing, but during the last few hours she had, on slender though\r\nsignificant evidence, exchanged her complacent expectancy for a\r\nconviction that something had gone wrong.  She had spent the previous\r\nevening at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, and had naturally seen nothing of Comus\r\nin that uncongenial quarter; neither had he put in an appearance at the\r\nbreakfast table the following morning.  She had met him in the hall at\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and he had hurried past her, merely imparting the\r\ninformation that he would not be in till dinner that evening.  He spoke\r\nin his sulkiest tone, and his face wore a look of defeat, thinly masked\r\nby an air of defiance; it was not the defiance of a man who is losing,\r\nbut of one who has already lost.\r\n\r\nFrancesca\xe2\x80\x99s conviction that things had gone wrong between Comus and\r\nElaine de Frey grew in strength as the day wore on.  She lunched at a\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s house, but it was not a quarter where special social information\r\nof any importance was likely to come early to hand.  Instead of the news\r\nshe was hankering for, she had to listen to trivial gossip and\r\nspeculation on the flirtations and \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caffairs\xe2\x80\x9d of a string of\r\nacquaintances whose matrimonial projects interested her about as much as\r\nthe nesting arrangements of the wildfowl in St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said her hostess, with the duly impressive emphasis of a\r\nprivileged chronicler, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve always regarded Claire as the marrying one\r\nof the family, so when Emily came to us and said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some news for\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 we all said, \xe2\x80\x98Claire\xe2\x80\x99s engaged!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nClaire this time, it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\xe2\x80\x99  So then we had to guess who the lucky man\r\nwas.  \xe2\x80\x98It can\xe2\x80\x99t be Captain Parminter,\xe2\x80\x99 we all said, \xe2\x80\x98because he\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nbeen sweet on Joan.\xe2\x80\x99  And then Emily said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe recording voice reeled off the catalogue of inane remarks with a\r\ncomfortable purring complacency that held out no hope of an early\r\nabandoning of the topic.  Francesca sat and wondered why the innocent\r\nacceptance of a cutlet and a glass of indifferent claret should lay one\r\nopen to such unsparing punishment.\r\n\r\nA stroll homeward through the Park after lunch brought no further\r\nenlightenment on the subject that was uppermost in her mind; what was\r\nworse, it brought her, without possibility of escape, within hailing\r\ndistance of Merla Blathington, who fastened on to her with the enthusiasm\r\nof a lonely tsetse fly encountering an outpost of civilisation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think,\xe2\x80\x9d she buzzed inconsequently, \xe2\x80\x9cmy sister in Cambridgeshire has\r\nhatched out thirty-three White Orpington chickens in her incubator!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat eggs did she put in it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Francesca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, some very special strain of White Orpington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything remarkable in the result.  If she had put in\r\ncrocodile\xe2\x80\x99s eggs and hatched out White Orpingtons, there might have been\r\nsomething to write to _Country Life_ about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat funny fascinating things these little green park-chairs are,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMerla, starting off on a fresh topic; \xe2\x80\x9cthey always look so quaint and\r\nknowing when they\xe2\x80\x99re stuck away in pairs by themselves under the trees,\r\nas if they were having a heart-to-heart talk or discussing a piece of\r\nvery private scandal.  If they could only speak, what tragedies and\r\ncomedies they could tell us of, what flirtations and proposals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be devoutly thankful that they can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca, with a\r\nshuddering recollection of the luncheon-table conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it would make one very careful what one said before them\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nabove them rather,\xe2\x80\x9d Merla rattled on, and then, to Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s infinite\r\nrelief, she espied another acquaintance sitting in unprotected solitude,\r\nwho promised to supply a more durable audience than her present rapidly\r\nmoving companion.  Francesca was free to return to her drawing-room in\r\nBlue Street to await with such patience as she could command the coming\r\nof some visitor who might be able to throw light on the subject that was\r\npuzzling and disquieting her.  The arrival of George St. Michael boded\r\nbad news, but at any rate news, and she gave him an almost cordial\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far wrong about Miss de Frey and Courtenay\r\nYoughal, was I?\xe2\x80\x9d he chirruped, almost before he had seated himself.\r\nFrancesca was to be spared any further spinning-out of her period of\r\nuncertainty.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s officially given out,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nappear in the _Morning Post_ to-morrow.  I heard it from Colonel Deel\r\nthis morning, and he had it direct from Youghal himself.  Yes, please,\r\none lump; I\xe2\x80\x99m not fashionable, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d  He had made the same remark\r\nabout the sugar in his tea with unfailing regularity for at least thirty\r\nyears.  Fashions in sugar are apparently stationary.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he proposed to her on the Terrace of the\r\nHouse, and a division bell rang, and he had to hurry off before she had\r\ntime to give her answer, and when he got back she simply said, \xe2\x80\x98the Ayes\r\nhave it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  St. Michael paused in his narrative to give an appreciative\r\ngiggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the sort of inanity that would go the rounds,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Francesca,\r\nwith the satisfaction of knowing that she was making the criticism direct\r\nto the author and begetter of the inanity in question.  Now that the blow\r\nhad fallen and she knew the full extent of its weight, her feeling\r\ntowards the bringer of bad news, who sat complacently nibbling at her\r\ntea-cakes and scattering crumbs of tiresome small-talk at her feet, was\r\none of wholehearted dislike.  She could sympathise with, or at any rate\r\nunderstand, the tendency of oriental despots to inflict death or\r\nignominious chastisement on messengers bearing tidings of misfortune and\r\ndefeat, and St. Michael, she perfectly well knew, was thoroughly aware of\r\nthe fact that her hopes and wishes had been centred on the possibility of\r\nhaving Elaine for a daughter-in-law; every purring remark that his mean\r\nlittle soul prompted him to contribute to the conversation had an easily\r\nrecognizable undercurrent of malice.  Fortunately for her powers of\r\npolite endurance, which had been put to such searching and repeated tests\r\nthat day, St. Michael had planned out for himself a busy little\r\ntime-table of afternoon visits, at each of which his self-appointed task\r\nof forestalling and embellishing the newspaper announcements of the\r\nYoughal-de Frey engagement would be hurriedly but thoroughly performed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite one of the best-looking and most interesting couples of\r\nthe Season, won\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, by way of farewell.  The door closed\r\nand Francesca Bassington sat alone in her drawing-room.\r\n\r\nBefore she could give way to the bitter luxury of reflection on the\r\ndownfall of her hopes, it was prudent to take precautionary measures\r\nagainst unwelcome intrusion.  Summoning the maid who had just speeded the\r\ndeparting St. Michael, she gave the order: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at home this\r\nafternoon to Lady Caroline Benaresq.\xe2\x80\x9d  On second thoughts she extended\r\nthe taboo to all possible callers, and sent a telephone message to catch\r\nComus at his club, asking him to come and see her as soon as he could\r\nmanage before it was time to dress for dinner.  Then she sat down to\r\nthink, and her thinking was beyond the relief of tears.\r\n\r\nShe had built herself a castle of hopes, and it had not been a castle in\r\nSpain, but a structure well on the probable side of the Pyrenees.  There\r\nhad been a solid foundation on which to build.  Miss de Frey\xe2\x80\x99s fortune\r\nwas an assured and unhampered one, her liking for Comus had been an\r\nobvious fact; his courtship of her a serious reality.  The young people\r\nhad been much together in public, and their names had naturally been\r\ncoupled in the match-making gossip of the day.  The only serious shadow\r\ncast over the scene had been the persistent presence, in foreground or\r\nbackground, of Courtenay Youghal.  And now the shadow suddenly stood\r\nforth as the reality, and the castle of hopes was a ruin, a hideous\r\nmortification of dust and d\xc3\xa9bris, with the skeleton outlines of its\r\nchambers still standing to make mockery of its discomfited architect.\r\nThe daily anxiety about Comus and his extravagant ways and intractable\r\ndisposition had been gradually lulled by the prospect of his making an\r\nadvantageous marriage, which would have transformed him from a\r\nne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-well and adventurer into a wealthy idler.  He might even have\r\nbeen moulded, by the resourceful influence of an ambitious wife, into a\r\nman with some definite purpose in life.  The prospect had vanished with\r\ncruel suddenness, and the anxieties were crowding back again, more\r\ninsistent than ever.  The boy had had his one good chance in the\r\nmatrimonial market and missed it; if he were to transfer his attentions\r\nto some other well-dowered girl he would be marked down at once as a\r\nfortune-hunter, and that would constitute a heavy handicap to the most\r\nplausible of wooers.  His liking for Elaine had evidently been genuine in\r\nits way, though perhaps it would have been rash to read any deeper\r\nsentiment into it, but even with the spur of his own inclination to\r\nassist him he had failed to win the prize that had seemed so temptingly\r\nwithin his reach.  And in the dashing of his prospects, Francesca saw the\r\nthreatening of her own.  The old anxiety as to her precarious tenure of\r\nher present quarters put on again all its familiar terrors.  One day, she\r\nforesaw, in the horribly near future, George St. Michael would come\r\npattering up her stairs with the breathless intelligence that Emmeline\r\nChetrof was going to marry somebody or other in the Guards or the Record\r\nOffice as the case might be, and then there would be an uprooting of her\r\nlife from its home and haven in Blue Street and a wandering forth to some\r\ncheap unhappy far-off dwelling, where the stately Van der Meulen and its\r\ncompanion host of beautiful and desirable things would be stuffed and\r\nstowed away in soulless surroundings, like courtly \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s fallen on evil\r\ndays.  It was unthinkable, but the trouble was that it had to be thought\r\nabout.  And if Comus had played his cards well and transformed himself\r\nfrom an encumbrance into a son with wealth at his command, the tragedy\r\nwhich she saw looming in front of her might have been avoided or at the\r\nworst whittled down to easily bearable proportions.  With money behind\r\none, the problem of where to live approaches more nearly to the simple\r\nquestion of where do you wish to live, and a rich daughter-in-law would\r\nhave surely seen to it that she did not have to leave her square mile of\r\nMecca and go out into the wilderness of bricks and mortar.  If the house\r\nin Blue Street could not have been compounded for there were other\r\ndesirable residences which would have been capable of consoling Francesca\r\nfor her lost Eden.  And now the detested Courtenay Youghal, with his\r\nmocking eyes and air of youthful cynicism, had stepped in and overthrown\r\nthose golden hopes and plans whose non-fulfilment would make such a world\r\nof change in her future.  Assuredly she had reason to feel bitter against\r\nthat young man, and she was not disposed to take a very lenient view of\r\nComus\xe2\x80\x99s own mismanagement of the affair; her greeting when he at last\r\narrived, was not couched in a sympathetic strain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have lost your chance with the heiress,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, coolly; \xe2\x80\x9cCourtenay Youghal has added her to his other\r\nsuccesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have added her to your other failures,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Francesca,\r\nrelentlessly; her temper had been tried that day beyond ordinary limits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you seemed getting along so well with her,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, as\r\nComus remained uncommunicative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hit it off rather well together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, and added with\r\ndeliberate bluntness, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she got rather sick at my borrowing\r\nmoney from her.  She thought it was all I was after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou borrowed money from her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca; \xe2\x80\x9cyou were fool enough to\r\nborrow money from a girl who was favourably disposed towards you, and\r\nwith Courtenay Youghal in the background waiting to step in and oust\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled with misery and rage.  This great stroke of\r\ngood luck that had seemed about to fall into their laps had been thrust\r\naside by an act or series of acts of wanton paltry folly.  The good ship\r\nhad been lost for the sake of the traditional ha\xe2\x80\x99porth of tar.  Comus had\r\npaid some pressing tailor\xe2\x80\x99s or tobacconist\xe2\x80\x99s bill with a loan unwillingly\r\nput at his disposal by the girl he was courting, and had flung away his\r\nchances of securing a wealthy and in every way desirable bride.  Elaine\r\nde Frey and her fortune might have been the making of Comus, but he had\r\nhurried in as usual to effect his own undoing.  Calmness did not in this\r\ncase come with reflection; the more Francesca thought about the matter,\r\nthe more exasperated she grew.  Comus threw himself down in a low chair\r\nand watched her without a trace of embarrassment or concern at her\r\nmortification.  He had come to her feeling rather sorry for himself, and\r\nbitterly conscious of his defeat, and she had met him with a taunt and\r\nwithout the least hint of sympathy; he determined that she should be\r\ntantalised with the knowledge of how small and stupid a thing had stood\r\nbetween the realisation and ruin of her hopes for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think she should be captured by Courtenay Youghal,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFrancesca, bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always deplored your intimacy with that young\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hardly my intimacy with him that\xe2\x80\x99s made Elaine accept him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nComus.\r\n\r\nFrancesca realised the futility of further upbraiding.  Through the tears\r\nof vexation that stood in her eyes, she looked across at the handsome boy\r\nwho sat opposite her, mocking at his own misfortune, perversely\r\nindifferent to his folly, seemingly almost indifferent to its\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComus,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly and wearily, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are an exact reversal of the\r\nlegend of Pandora\xe2\x80\x99s Box.  You have all the charm and advantages that a\r\nboy could want to help him on in the world, and behind it all there is\r\nthe fatal damning gift of utter hopelessness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the best description that anyone has ever\r\ngiven of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment there was a flush of sympathy and something like outspoken\r\naffection between mother and son.  They seemed very much alone in the\r\nworld just now, and in the general overturn of hopes and plans, there\r\nflickered a chance that each might stretch out a hand to the other, and\r\nsummon back to their lives an old dead love that was the best and\r\nstrongest feeling either of them had known.  But the sting of\r\ndisappointment was too keen, and the flood of resentment mounted too high\r\non either side to allow the chance more than a moment in which to flicker\r\naway into nothingness.  The old fatal topic of estrangement came to the\r\nfore, the question of immediate ways and means, and mother and son faced\r\nthemselves again as antagonists on a well-disputed field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is done is done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca, with a movement of tragic\r\nimpatience that belied the philosophy of her words; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing to\r\nbe gained by crying over spilt milk.  There is the present and the future\r\nto be thought about, though.  One can\xe2\x80\x99t go on indefinitely as a\r\ntenant-for-life in a fools\xe2\x80\x99 paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then she pulled herself together\r\nand proceeded to deliver an ultimatum which the force of circumstances no\r\nlonger permitted her to hold in reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not much use talking to you about money, as I know from long\r\nexperience, but I can only tell you this, that in the middle of the\r\nSeason I\xe2\x80\x99m already obliged to be thinking of leaving Town.  And you, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid, will have to be thinking of leaving England at equally short\r\nnotice.  Henry told me the other day that he can get you something out in\r\nWest Africa.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve had your chance of doing something better for\r\nyourself from the financial point of view, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown it away for\r\nthe sake of borrowing a little ready money for your luxuries, so now you\r\nmust take what you can get.  The pay won\xe2\x80\x99t be very good at first, but\r\nliving is not dear out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWest Africa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, reflectively; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of modern\r\nsubstitute for the old-fashioned _oubliette_, a convenient depository for\r\ntiresome people.  Dear Uncle Henry may talk lugubriously about the burden\r\nof Empire, but he evidently recognises its uses as a refuse consumer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Comus, you are talking of the West Africa of yesterday.  While\r\nyou have been wasting your time at school, and worse than wasting your\r\ntime in the West End, other people have been grappling with the study of\r\ntropical diseases, and the West African coast country is being rapidly\r\ntransformed from a lethal chamber into a sanatorium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComus laughed mockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beautiful bit of persuasive prose; it reminds one of the Psalms\r\nand even more of a company prospectus.  If you were honest you\xe2\x80\x99d confess\r\nthat you lifted it straight out of a rubber or railway promotion scheme.\r\nSeriously, mother, if I must grub about for a living, why can\xe2\x80\x99t I do it\r\nin England?  I could go into a brewery for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca shook her head decisively; she could foresee the sort of steady\r\nwork Comus was likely to accomplish, with the lodestone of Town and the\r\nminor attractions of race-meetings and similar festivities always\r\nbeckoning to him from a conveniently attainable distance, but apart from\r\nthat aspect of the case there was a financial obstacle in the way of his\r\nobtaining any employment at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreweries and all those sort of things necessitate money to start with;\r\none has to pay premiums or invest capital in the undertaking, and so\r\nforth.  And as we have no money available, and can scarcely pay our debts\r\nas it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s no use thinking about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we sell something?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Comus.\r\n\r\nHe made no actual suggestion as to what should be sacrificed, but he was\r\nlooking straight at the Van der Meulen.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Francesca felt a stifling sensation of weakness, as though\r\nher heart was going to stop beating.  Then she sat forward in her chair\r\nand spoke with energy, almost fierceness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am dead my things can be sold and dispersed.  As long as I am\r\nalive I prefer to keep them by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her holy place, with all her treasured possessions around her, this\r\ndreadful suggestion had been made.  Some of her cherished household gods,\r\nsouvenirs and keepsakes from past days, would, perhaps, not have fetched\r\na very considerable sum in the auction-room, others had a distinct value\r\nof their own, but to her they were all precious.  And the Van der Meulen,\r\nat which Comus had looked with impious appraising eyes, was the most\r\nsacred of them all.  When Francesca had been away from her Town residence\r\nor had been confined to her bedroom through illness, the great picture\r\nwith its stately solemn representation of a long-ago battle-scene,\r\npainted to flatter the flattery-loving soul of a warrior-king who was\r\ndignified even in his campaigns\xe2\x80\x94this was the first thing she visited on\r\nher return to Town or convalescence.  If an alarm of fire had been raised\r\nit would have been the first thing for whose safety she would have\r\ntroubled.  And Comus had almost suggested that it should be parted with,\r\nas one sold railway shares and other soulless things.\r\n\r\nScolding, she had long ago realised, was a useless waste of time and\r\nenergy where Comus was concerned, but this evening she unloosed her\r\ntongue for the mere relief that it gave to her surcharged feelings.  He\r\nsat listening without comment, though she purposely let fall remarks that\r\nshe hoped might sting him into self-defence or protest.  It was an\r\nunsparing indictment, the more damaging in that it was so irrefutably\r\ntrue, the more tragic in that it came from perhaps the one person in the\r\nworld whose opinion he had ever cared for.  And he sat through it as\r\nsilent and seemingly unmoved as though she had been rehearsing a speech\r\nfor some drawing-room comedy.  When she had had her say his method of\r\nretort was not the soft answer that turneth away wrath but the\r\ninconsequent one that shelves it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and dress for dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe meal, like so many that Francesca and Comus had eaten in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany of late, was a silent one.  Now that the full bearings of the\r\ndisaster had been discussed in all its aspects there was nothing more to\r\nbe said.  Any attempt at ignoring the situation, and passing on to less\r\ncontroversial topics would have been a mockery and pretence which neither\r\nof them would have troubled to sustain.  So the meal went forward with\r\nits dragged-out dreary intimacy of two people who were separated by a\r\ngulf of bitterness, and whose hearts were hard with resentment against\r\none another.\r\n\r\nFrancesca felt a sense of relief when she was able to give the maid the\r\norder to serve her coffee upstairs.  Comus had a sullen scowl on his\r\nface, but he looked up as she rose to leave the room, and gave his\r\nhalf-mocking little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t look so tragic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to have your own\r\nway.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out to that West African hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMUS found his way to his seat in the stalls of the Straw Exchange\r\nTheatre and turned to watch the stream of distinguished and\r\ndistinguishable people who made their appearance as a matter of course at\r\na First Night in the height of the Season.  Pit and gallery were already\r\npacked with a throng, tense, expectant and alert, that waited for the\r\nrise of the curtain with the eager patience of a terrier watching a\r\ndilatory human prepare for outdoor exercises.  Stalls and boxes filled\r\nslowly and hesitatingly with a crowd whose component units seemed for the\r\nmost part to recognise the probability that they were quite as\r\ninteresting as any play they were likely to see.  Those who bore no\r\nparticular face-value themselves derived a certain amount of social\r\ndignity from the near neighbourhood of obvious notabilities; if one could\r\nnot obtain recognition oneself there was some vague pleasure in being\r\nable to recognise notoriety at intimately close quarters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that woman with the auburn hair and a rather effective\r\nbelligerent gleam in her eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a man sitting just behind Comus;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe looks as if she might have created the world in six days and\r\ndestroyed it on the seventh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forget her name,\xe2\x80\x9d said his neighbour; \xe2\x80\x9cshe writes.  She\xe2\x80\x99s the author\r\nof that book, \xe2\x80\x98The Woman who wished it was Wednesday,\xe2\x80\x99 you know.  It used\r\nto be the convention that women writers should be plain and dowdy; now we\r\nhave gone to the other extreme and build them on extravagantly decorative\r\nlines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA buzz of recognition came from the front rows of the pit, together with\r\na craning of necks on the part of those in less favoured seats.  It\r\nheralded the arrival of Sherard Blaw, the dramatist who had discovered\r\nhimself, and who had given so ungrudgingly of his discovery to the world.\r\nLady Caroline, who was already directing little conversational onslaughts\r\nfrom her box, gazed gently for a moment at the new arrival, and then\r\nturned to the silver-haired Archdeacon sitting beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say the poor man is haunted by the fear that he will die during a\r\ngeneral election, and that his obituary notices will be seriously\r\ncurtailed by the space taken up by the election results.  The curse of\r\nour party system, from his point of view, is that it takes up so much\r\nroom in the press.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon smiled indulgently.  As a man he was so exquisitely\r\nworldly that he fully merited the name of the Heavenly Worldling bestowed\r\non him by an admiring duchess, and withal his texture was shot with a\r\npattern of such genuine saintliness that one felt that whoever else might\r\nhold the keys of Paradise he, at least, possessed a private latchkey to\r\nthat abode.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not significant of the altered grouping of things,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the Church, as represented by me, sympathises with the message of\r\nSherard Blaw, while neither the man nor his message find acceptance with\r\nunbelievers like you, Lady Caroline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Caroline blinked her eyes.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Archdeacon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cno one\r\ncan be an unbeliever nowadays.  The Christian Apologists have left one\r\nnothing to disbelieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon rose with a delighted chuckle.  \xe2\x80\x9cI must go and tell that\r\nto De la Poulett,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indicating a clerical figure sitting in the\r\nthird row of the stalls; \xe2\x80\x9che spends his life explaining from his pulpit\r\nthat the glory of Christianity consists in the fact that though it is not\r\ntrue it has been found necessary to invent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of the box opened and Courtenay Youghal entered, bringing with\r\nhim subtle suggestion of chaminade and an atmosphere of political\r\ntension.  The Government had fallen out of the good graces of a section\r\nof its supporters, and those who were not in the know were busy\r\npredicting a serious crisis over a forthcoming division in the Committee\r\nstage of an important Bill.  This was Saturday night, and unless some\r\nsuccessful cajolery were effected between now and Monday afternoon,\r\nMinisters would be, seemingly, in danger of defeat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here is Youghal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Archdeacon; \xe2\x80\x9che will be able to tell us\r\nwhat is going to happen in the next forty-eight hours.  I hear the Prime\r\nMinister says it is a matter of conscience, and they will stand or fall\r\nby it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hopes and sympathies were notoriously on the Ministerial side.\r\n\r\nYoughal greeted Lady Caroline and subsided gracefully into a chair well\r\nin the front of the box.  A buzz of recognition rippled slowly across the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Government to fall on a matter of conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\nbe like a man cutting himself with a safety razor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Caroline purred a gentle approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s true, Archdeacon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nNo one can effectively defend a Government when it\xe2\x80\x99s been in office\r\nseveral years.  The Archdeacon took refuge in light skirmishing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe Lady Caroline sees the makings of a great Socialist statesman\r\nin you, Youghal,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Socialist statesmen aren\xe2\x80\x99t made, they\xe2\x80\x99re stillborn,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nYoughal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the play about to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a pale young woman who had taken\r\nno part in the talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s dull.  If there is\r\nany brilliant conversation in it I shall burst into tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the front row of the upper circle a woman with a restless\r\nstarling-voice was discussing the work of a temporarily fashionable\r\ncomposer, chiefly in relation to her own emotions, which she seemed to\r\nthink might prove generally interesting to those around her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I hear his music I feel that I want to go up into a mountain\r\nand pray.  Can you understand that feeling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl to whom she was unburdening herself shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard his music chiefly in Switzerland, and we were up\r\namong the mountains all the time, so it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made any\r\ndifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, who seemed to have emergency emotions to\r\nsuit all geographical conditions, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have wanted to be in a great\r\nsilent plain by the side of a rushing river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I think is so splendid about his music\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d commenced another\r\nstarling-voice on the further side of the girl.  Like sheep that feed\r\ngreedily before the coming of a storm the starling-voices seemed impelled\r\nto extra effort by the knowledge of four imminent intervals of acting\r\nduring which they would be hushed into constrained silence.\r\n\r\nIn the back row of the dress circle a late-comer, after a cursory glance\r\nat the programme, had settled down into a comfortable narrative, which\r\nwas evidently the resumed thread of an unfinished taxi-drive monologue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all said \xe2\x80\x98it can\xe2\x80\x99t be Captain Parminter, because he\xe2\x80\x99s always been\r\nsweet on Joan,\xe2\x80\x99 and then Emily said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curtain went up, and Emily\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the discussion had to be\r\nheld over till the entr\xe2\x80\x99acte.\r\n\r\nThe play promised to be a success.  The author, avoiding the pitfall of\r\nbrilliancy, had aimed at being interesting and as far as possible,\r\nbearing in mind that his play was a comedy, he had striven to be amusing.\r\nAbove all he had remembered that in the laws of stage proportions it is\r\npermissible and generally desirable that the part should be greater than\r\nthe whole; hence he had been careful to give the leading lady such a\r\nclear and commanding lead over the other characters of the play that it\r\nwas impossible for any of them ever to get on level terms with her.  The\r\naction of the piece was now and then delayed thereby, but the duration of\r\nits run would be materially prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe curtain came down on the first act amid an encouraging instalment of\r\napplause, and the audience turned its back on the stage and began to take\r\na renewed interest in itself.  The authoress of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Woman who wished it\r\nwas Wednesday\xe2\x80\x9d had swept like a convalescent whirlwind, subdued but\r\npotentially tempestuous, into Lady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just trodden with all my weight on the foot of an eminent publisher\r\nas I was leaving my seat,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a peal of delighted laughter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was such a dear about it; I said I hoped I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him, and he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose you think, who drives hard bargains should himself be\r\nhard.\xe2\x80\x99  Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it pet-lamb of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never trodden on a pet lamb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline, \xe2\x80\x9cso I\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea\r\nwhat its behaviour would be under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the authoress, coming to the front of the box, the better\r\nto survey the house, and perhaps also with a charitable desire to make\r\nthings easy for those who might pardonably wish to survey her, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me,\r\nplease, where is the girl sitting whom Courtenay Youghal is engaged to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine was pointed out to her, sitting in the fourth row of the stalls,\r\non the opposite side of the house to where Comus had his seat.  Once\r\nduring the interval she had turned to give him a friendly nod of\r\nrecognition as he stood in one of the side gangways, but he was absorbed\r\nat the moment in looking at himself in the glass panel.  The grave brown\r\neyes and the mocking green-grey ones had looked their last into each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s depths.\r\n\r\nFor Comus this first-night performance, with its brilliant gathering of\r\nspectators, its groups and coteries of lively talkers, even its\r\ncounterfoil of dull chatterers, its pervading atmosphere of stage and\r\nsocial movement, and its intruding undercurrent of political flutter, all\r\nthis composed a tragedy in which he was the chief character.  It was the\r\nlife he knew and loved and basked in, and it was the life he was leaving.\r\nIt would go on reproducing itself again and again, with its stage\r\ninterest and social interest and intruding outside interests, with the\r\nsame lively chattering crowd, the people who had done things being\r\npointed out by people who recognised them to people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it would\r\nall go on with unflagging animation and sparkle and enjoyment, and for\r\nhim it would have stopped utterly.  He would be in some unheard-of\r\nsun-blistered wilderness, where natives and pariah dogs and\r\nraucous-throated crows fringed round mockingly on one\xe2\x80\x99s loneliness, where\r\none rode for sweltering miles for the chance of meeting a collector or\r\npolice officer, with whom most likely on closer acquaintance one had\r\nhardly two ideas in common, where female society was represented at long\r\nintervals by some climate-withered woman missionary or official\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\nwhere food and sickness and veterinary lore became at last the three\r\noutstanding subjects on which the mind settled or rather sank.  That was\r\nthe life he foresaw and dreaded, and that was the life he was going to.\r\nFor a boy who went out to it from the dulness of some country rectory,\r\nfrom a neighbourhood where a flower show and a cricket match formed the\r\nsocial landmarks of the year, the feeling of exile might not be very\r\ncrushing, might indeed be lost in the sense of change and adventure.  But\r\nComus had lived too thoroughly in the centre of things to regard life in\r\na backwater as anything else than stagnation, and stagnation while one is\r\nyoung he justly regarded as an offence against nature and reason, in\r\nkeeping with the perverted mockery that sends decrepit invalids touring\r\npainfully about the world and shuts panthers up in narrow cages.  He was\r\nbeing put aside, as a wine is put aside, but to deteriorate instead of\r\ngaining in the process, to lose the best time of his youth and health and\r\ngood looks in a world where youth and health and good looks count for\r\nmuch and where time never returns lost possessions.  And thus, as the\r\ncurtain swept down on the close of each act, Comus felt a sense of\r\ndepression and deprivation sweep down on himself; bitterly he watched his\r\nlast evening of social gaiety slipping away to its end.  In less than an\r\nhour it would be over; in a few months\xe2\x80\x99 time it would be an unreal\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nIn the third interval, as he gazed round at the chattering house, someone\r\ntouched him on the arm.  It was Lady Veula Croot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time you\xe2\x80\x99ll be on the high seas,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncoming to your farewell dinner, you know; your mother has just asked me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk the usual rot to you about how much you will like\r\nit and so on.  I sometimes think that one of the advantages of Hell will\r\nbe that no one will have the impertinence to point out to you that you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nreally better off than you would be anywhere else.  What do you think of\r\nthe play?  Of course one can foresee the end; she will come to her\r\nhusband with the announcement that their longed-for child is going to be\r\nborn, and that will smooth over everything.  So conveniently effective,\r\nto wind up a comedy with the commencement of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy.  And\r\nevery one will go away saying \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it had a happy ending.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Veula moved back to her seat, with her pleasant smile on her lips\r\nand the look of infinite weariness in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe interval, the last interval, was drawing to a close and the house\r\nbegan to turn with fidgetty attention towards the stage for the unfolding\r\nof the final phase of the play.  Francesca sat in Serena Golackly\xe2\x80\x99s box\r\nlistening to Colonel Springfield\xe2\x80\x99s story of what happened to a\r\npigeon-cote in his compound at Poona.  Everyone who knew the Colonel had\r\nto listen to that story a good many times, but Lady Caroline had\r\nmitigated the boredom of the infliction, and in fact invested it with a\r\ncertain sporting interest, by offering a prize to the person who heard it\r\noftenest in the course of the Season, the competitors being under an\r\nhonourable understanding not to lead up to the subject.  Ada Spelvexit\r\nand a boy in the Foreign Office were at present at the top of the list\r\nwith five recitals each to their score, but the former was suspected of\r\ndoubtful adherence to the rules and spirit of the competition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there, dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cwere the eleven dead\r\npigeons.  What had become of the bandicoot no one ever knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca thanked him for his story, and complacently inscribed the\r\nfigure 4 on the margin of her theatre programme.  Almost at the same\r\nmoment she heard George St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s voice pattering out a breathless\r\npiece of intelligence for the edification of Serena Golackly and anyone\r\nelse who might care to listen.  Francesca galvanised into sudden\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmmeline Chetrof to a fellow in the Indian Forest Department.  He\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nnothing but his pay and they can\xe2\x80\x99t be married for four or five years; an\r\nabsurdly long engagement, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?  All very well to wait\r\nseven years for a wife in patriarchal times, when you probably had others\r\nto go on with, and you lived long enough to celebrate your own\r\ntercentenary, but under modern conditions it seems a foolish\r\narrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. Michael spoke almost with a sense of grievance.  A marriage project\r\nthat tied up all the small pleasant nuptial gossip-items about\r\nbridesmaids and honeymoon and recalcitrant aunts and so forth, for an\r\nindefinite number of years seemed scarcely decent in his eyes, and there\r\nwas little satisfaction or importance to be derived from early and\r\nspecial knowledge of an event which loomed as far distant as a\r\nPresidential Election or a change of Viceroy.  But to Francesca, who had\r\nlistened with startled apprehension at the mention of Emmeline Chetrof\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, the news came in a flood of relief and thankfulness.  Short of\r\nentering a nunnery and taking celibate vows, Emmeline could hardly have\r\nbehaved more conveniently than in tying herself up to a lover whose\r\ncircumstances made it necessary to relegate marriage to the distant\r\nfuture.  For four or five years Francesca was assured of undisturbed\r\npossession of the house in Blue Street, and after that period who knew\r\nwhat might happen?  The engagement might stretch on indefinitely, it\r\nmight even come to nothing under the weight of its accumulated years, as\r\nsometimes happened with these protracted affairs.  Emmeline might lose\r\nher fancy for her absentee lover, and might never replace him with\r\nanother.  A golden possibility of perpetual tenancy of her present home\r\nbegan to float once more through Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s mind.  As long as Emmeline\r\nhad been unbespoken in the marriage market there had always been the\r\nhaunting likelihood of seeing the dreaded announcement, \xe2\x80\x9ca marriage has\r\nbeen arranged and will shortly take place,\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with her name.\r\nAnd now a marriage had been arranged and would not shortly take place,\r\nmight indeed never take place.  St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s information was likely to\r\nbe correct in this instance; he would never have invented a piece of\r\nmatrimonial intelligence which gave such little scope for supplementary\r\ndetail of the kind he loved to supply.  As Francesca turned to watch the\r\nfourth act of the play, her mind was singing a p\xc3\xa6an of thankfulness and\r\nexultation.  It was as though some artificer sent by the Gods had\r\nreinforced with a substantial cord the horsehair thread that held up the\r\nsword of Damocles over her head.  Her love for her home, for her\r\ntreasured household possessions, and her pleasant social life was able to\r\nexpand once more in present security, and feed on future hope.  She was\r\nstill young enough to count four or five years as a long time, and\r\nto-night she was optimistic enough to prophesy smooth things of the\r\nfuture that lay beyond that span.  Of the fourth act, with its carefully\r\nheld back but obviously imminent reconciliation between the leading\r\ncharacters, she took in but little, except that she vaguely understood it\r\nto have a happy ending.  As the lights went up she looked round on the\r\ndispersing audience with a feeling of friendliness uppermost in her mind;\r\neven the sight of Elaine de Frey and Courtenay Youghal leaving the\r\ntheatre together did not inspire her with a tenth part of the annoyance\r\nthat their entrance had caused her.  Serena\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to go on to the\r\nSavoy for supper fitted in exactly with her mood of exhilaration.  It\r\nwould be a fit and appropriate wind-up to an auspicious evening.  The\r\ncold chicken and modest brand of Chablis waiting for her at home should\r\ngive way to a banquet of more festive nature.\r\n\r\nIn the crush of the vestibule, friends and enemies, personal and\r\npolitical, were jostled and locked together in the general effort to\r\nrejoin temporarily estranged garments and secure the attendance of\r\nelusive vehicles.  Lady Caroline found herself at close quarters with the\r\nestimable Henry Greech, and experienced some of the joy which comes to\r\nthe homeward wending sportsman when a chance shot presents itself on\r\nwhich he may expend his remaining cartridges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the Government is going to climb down, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a\r\nprovocative assumption of private information on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you the Government will do nothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nMember of Parliament with befitting dignity; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Prime Minister told me\r\nlast night that under no circumstances\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mr. Greech,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline, \xe2\x80\x9cwe all know that Prime\r\nMinisters are wedded to the truth, but like other wedded couples they\r\nsometimes live apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor her, at any rate, the comedy had had a happy ending.\r\n\r\nComus made his way slowly and lingeringly from the stalls, so slowly that\r\nthe lights were already being turned down and great shroud-like\r\ndust-cloths were being swaythed over the ornamental gilt-work.  The\r\nlaughing, chattering, yawning throng had filtered out of the vestibule,\r\nand was melting away in final groups from the steps of the theatre.  An\r\nimpatient attendant gave him his coat and locked up the cloak room.\r\nComus stepped out under the portico; he looked at the posters announcing\r\nthe play, and in anticipation he could see other posters announcing its\r\n200th performance.  Two hundred performances; by that time the Straw\r\nExchange Theatre would be to him something so remote and unreal that it\r\nwould hardly seem to exist or to have ever existed except in his fancy.\r\nAnd to the laughing chattering throng that would pass in under that\r\nportico to the 200th performance, he would be, to those that had known\r\nhim, something equally remote and non-existent.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe good-looking\r\nBassington boy?  Oh, dead, or rubber-growing or sheep-farming or\r\nsomething of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE farewell dinner which Francesca had hurriedly organised in honour of\r\nher son\xe2\x80\x99s departure threatened from the outset to be a doubtfully\r\nsuccessful function.  In the first place, as he observed privately, there\r\nwas very little of Comus and a good deal of farewell in it.  His own\r\nparticular friends were unrepresented.  Courtenay Youghal was out of the\r\nquestion; and though Francesca would have stretched a point and welcomed\r\nsome of his other male associates of whom she scarcely approved, he\r\nhimself had been opposed to including any of them in the invitations.  On\r\nthe other hand, as Henry Greech had provided Comus with this job that he\r\nwas going out to, and was, moreover, finding part of the money for the\r\nnecessary outfit, Francesca had felt it her duty to ask him and his wife\r\nto the dinner; the obtuseness that seems to cling to some people like a\r\ngarment throughout their life had caused Mr. Greech to accept the\r\ninvitation.  When Comus heard of the circumstance he laughed long and\r\nboisterously; his spirits, Francesca noted, seemed to be rising fast as\r\nthe hour for departure drew near.\r\n\r\nThe other guests included Serena Golackly and Lady Veula, the latter\r\nhaving been asked on the inspiration of the moment at the theatrical\r\nfirst-night.  In the height of the Season it was not easy to get together\r\na goodly selection of guests at short notice, and Francesca had gladly\r\nfallen in with Serena\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion of bringing with her Stephen Thorle,\r\nwho was alleged, in loose feminine phrasing, to \xe2\x80\x9cknow all about\xe2\x80\x9d tropical\r\nAfrica.  His travels and experiences in those regions probably did not\r\ncover much ground or stretch over any great length of time, but he was\r\none of those individuals who can describe a continent on the strength of\r\na few days\xe2\x80\x99 stay in a coast town as intimately and dogmatically as a\r\npaleontologist will reconstruct an extinct mammal from the evidence of a\r\nstray shin bone.  He had the loud penetrating voice and the prominent\r\npenetrating eyes of a man who can do no listening in the ordinary way and\r\nwhose eyes have to perform the function of listening for him.  His vanity\r\ndid not necessarily make him unbearable, unless one had to spend much\r\ntime in his society, and his need for a wide field of audience and\r\nadmiration was mercifully calculated to spread his operations over a\r\nconsiderable human area.  Moreover, his craving for attentive listeners\r\nforced him to interest himself in a wonderful variety of subjects on\r\nwhich he was able to discourse fluently and with a certain semblance of\r\nspecial knowledge.  Politics he avoided; the ground was too well known,\r\nand there was a definite no to every definite yes that could be put\r\nforward.  Moreover, argument was not congenial to his disposition, which\r\npreferred an unchallenged flow of dissertation modified by occasional\r\nhelpful questions which formed the starting point for new offshoots of\r\nword-spinning.  The promotion of cottage industries, the prevention of\r\njuvenile street trading, the extension of the Borstal prison system, the\r\nfurtherance of vague talkative religious movements the fostering of\r\ninter-racial _ententes_, all found in him a tireless exponent, a fluent\r\nand entertaining, though perhaps not very convincing, advocate.  With the\r\nreal motive power behind these various causes he was not very closely\r\nidentified; to the spade-workers who carried on the actual labours of\r\neach particular movement he bore the relation of a trowel-worker, delving\r\nsuperficially at the surface, but able to devote a proportionately far\r\ngreater amount of time to the advertisement of his progress and\r\nachievements.  Such was Stephen Thorle, a governess in the nursery of\r\nChelsea-bred religions, a skilled window-dresser in the emporium of his\r\nown personality, and needless to say, evanescently popular amid a wide\r\nbut shifting circle of acquaintances.  He improved on the record of a\r\nsocially much-travelled individual whose experience has become classical,\r\nand went to most of the best houses\xe2\x80\x94twice.\r\n\r\nHis inclusion as a guest at this particular dinner-party was not a very\r\nhappy inspiration.  He was inclined to patronise Comus, as well as the\r\nAfrican continent, and on even slighter acquaintance.  With the exception\r\nof Henry Greech, whose feelings towards his nephew had been soured by\r\nmany years of overt antagonism, there was an uncomfortable feeling among\r\nthose present that the topic of the black-sheep export trade, as Comus\r\nwould have himself expressed it, was being given undue prominence in what\r\nshould have been a festive farewell banquet.  And Comus, in whose honour\r\nthe feast was given, did not contribute much towards its success; though\r\nhis spirits seemed strung up to a high pitch his merriment was more the\r\nmerriment of a cynical and amused onlooker than of one who responds to\r\nthe gaiety of his companions.  Sometimes he laughed quietly to himself at\r\nsome chance remark of a scarcely mirth-provoking nature, and Lady Veula,\r\nwatching him narrowly, came to the conclusion that an element of fear was\r\nblended with his seemingly buoyant spirits.  Once or twice he caught her\r\neye across the table, and a certain sympathy seemed to grow up between\r\nthem, as though they were both consciously watching some lugubrious\r\ncomedy that was being played out before them.\r\n\r\nAn untoward little incident had marked the commencement of the meal.  A\r\nsmall still-life picture that hung over the sideboard had snapped its\r\ncord and slid down with an alarming clatter on to the crowded board\r\nbeneath it.  The picture itself was scarcely damaged, but its fall had\r\nbeen accompanied by a tinkle of broken glass, and it was found that a\r\nliqueur glass, one out of a set of seven that would be impossible to\r\nmatch, had been shivered into fragments.  Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s almost motherly\r\nlove for her possessions made her peculiarly sensible to a feeling of\r\nannoyance and depression at the accident, but she turned politely to\r\nlisten to Mrs. Greech\xe2\x80\x99s account of a misfortune in which four soup-plates\r\nwere involved.  Mrs. Henry was not a brilliant conversationalist, and her\r\nflank was speedily turned by Stephen Thorle, who recounted a slum\r\nexperience in which two entire families did all their feeding out of one\r\ndamaged soup-plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gratitude of those poor creatures when I presented them with a set\r\nof table crockery apiece, the tears in their eyes and in their voices\r\nwhen they thanked me, would be impossible to describe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you all the same for describing it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus.\r\n\r\nThe listening eyes went swiftly round the table to gather evidence as to\r\nhow this rather disconcerting remark had been received, but Thorle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice continued uninterruptedly to retail stories of East-end gratitude,\r\nnever failing to mention the particular deeds of disinterested charity on\r\nhis part which had evoked and justified the gratitude.  Mrs. Greech had\r\nto suppress the interesting sequel to her broken-crockery narrative, to\r\nwit, how she subsequently matched the shattered soup-plates at Harrod\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nLike an imported plant species that sometimes flourishes exceedingly, and\r\nmakes itself at home to the dwarfing and overshadowing of all native\r\nspecies, Thorle dominated the dinner-party and thrust its original\r\npurport somewhat into the background.  Serena began to look helplessly\r\napologetic.  It was altogether rather a relief when the filling of\r\nchampagne glasses gave Francesca an excuse for bringing matters back to\r\ntheir intended footing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must all drink a health,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cComus, my own dear boy, a safe\r\nand happy voyage to you, much prosperity in the life you are going out\r\nto, and in due time a safe and happy return\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand gave an involuntary jerk in the act of raising the glass, and\r\nthe wine went streaming across the tablecloth in a froth of yellow\r\nbubbles.  It certainly was not turning out a comfortable or auspicious\r\ndinner party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear mother,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Comus, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have been drinking healths all\r\nthe afternoon to make your hand so unsteady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed gaily and with apparent carelessness, but again Lady Veula\r\ncaught the frightened note in his laughter.  Mrs. Henry, with practical\r\nsympathy, was telling Francesca two good ways for getting wine stains out\r\nof tablecloths.  The smaller economies of life were an unnecessary branch\r\nof learning for Mrs. Greech, but she studied them as carefully and\r\nconscientiously as a stay-at-home plain-dwelling English child commits to\r\nmemory the measurements and altitudes of the world\xe2\x80\x99s principal mountain\r\npeaks.  Some women of her temperament and mentality know by heart the\r\nfavourite colours, flowers and hymn-tunes of all the members of the Royal\r\nFamily; Mrs. Greech would possibly have failed in an examination of that\r\nnature, but she knew what to do with carrots that have been over-long in\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nFrancesca did not renew her speech-making; a chill seemed to have fallen\r\nover all efforts at festivity, and she contented herself with refilling\r\nher glass and simply drinking to her boy\xe2\x80\x99s good health.  The others\r\nfollowed her example, and Comus drained his glass with a brief \xe2\x80\x9cthank you\r\nall very much.\xe2\x80\x9d  The sense of constraint which hung over the company was\r\nnot, however, marked by any uncomfortable pause in the conversation.\r\nHenry Greech was a fluent thinker, of the kind that prefer to do their\r\nthinking aloud; the silence that descended on him as a mantle in the\r\nHouse of Commons was an official livery of which he divested himself as\r\nthoroughly as possible in private life.  He did not propose to sit\r\nthrough dinner as a mere listener to Mr. Thorle\xe2\x80\x99s personal narrative of\r\nphilanthropic movements and experiences, and took the first opportunity\r\nof launching himself into a flow of satirical observations on current\r\npolitical affairs.  Lady Veula was inured to this sort of thing in her\r\nown home circle, and sat listening with the stoical indifference with\r\nwhich an Esquimau might accept the occurrence of one snowstorm the more,\r\nin the course of an Arctic winter.  Serena Golackly felt a certain relief\r\nat the fact that her imported guest was not, after all, monopolising the\r\nconversation.  But the latter was too determined a personality to allow\r\nhimself to be thrust aside for many minutes by the talkative M.P.  Henry\r\nGreech paused for an instant to chuckle at one of his own shafts of\r\nsatire, and immediately Thorle\xe2\x80\x99s penetrating voice swept across the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you politicians!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with pleasant superiority; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nalways fighting about how things should be done, and the consequence is\r\nyou are never able to do anything.  Would you like me to tell you what a\r\nUnitarian horsedealer said to me at Brindisi about politicians?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Unitarian horsedealer at Brindisi had all the allurement of the\r\nunexpected.  Henry Greech\xe2\x80\x99s witticisms at the expense of the Front\r\nOpposition bench were destined to remain as unfinished as his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory of the broken soup-plates.  Thorle was primed with an ample\r\nsuccession of stories and themes, chiefly concerning poverty,\r\nthriftlessness, reclamation, reformed characters, and so forth, which\r\ncarried him in an almost uninterrupted sequence through the remainder of\r\nthe dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want to do is to make people think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning his\r\nprominent eyes on to his hostess; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to make people think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate you give them the opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, cryptically.\r\n\r\nAs the ladies rose to leave the table Comus crossed over to pick up one\r\nof Lady Veula\xe2\x80\x99s gloves that had fallen to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know you kept a dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Veula.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Comus, \xe2\x80\x9cthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t one in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have sworn I saw one follow you across the hall this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA small black dog, something like a schipperke?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Comus in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it myself to-night; it ran from behind my chair just as I was\r\nsitting down.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to the others about it; it would\r\nfrighten my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever seen it before?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Veula asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce, when I was six years old.  It followed my father downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Veula said nothing.  She knew that Comus had lost his father at the\r\nage of six.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Serena made nervous excuses for her talkative friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, rather an interesting man, you know, and up to the eyes in all\r\nsorts of movements.  Just the sort of person to turn loose at a\r\ndrawing-room meeting, or to send down to a mission-hall in some\r\nunheard-of neighbourhood.  Given a sounding-board and a harmonium, and a\r\ntitled woman of some sort in the chair, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be perfectly happy; I\r\nmust say I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t realised how overpowering he might be at a small\r\ndinner-party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say he was a very good man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Greech; she had forgiven\r\nthe mutilation of her soup-plate story.\r\n\r\nThe party broke up early as most of the guests had other engagements to\r\nkeep.  With a belated recognition of the farewell nature of the occasion\r\nthey made pleasant little good-bye remarks to Comus, with the usual\r\npredictions of prosperity and anticipations of an ultimate auspicious\r\nreturn.  Even Henry Greech sank his personal dislike of the boy for the\r\nmoment, and made hearty jocular allusions to a home-coming, which, in the\r\nelder man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, seemed possibly pleasantly remote.  Lady Veula alone\r\nmade no reference to the future; she simply said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Comus,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nher voice was the kindest of all and he responded with a look of\r\ngratitude.  The weariness in her eyes was more marked than ever as she\r\nlay back against the cushions of her carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a tragedy life is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, aloud to herself.\r\n\r\nSerena and Stephen Thorle were the last to leave, and Francesca stood\r\nalone for a moment at the head of the stairway watching Comus laughing\r\nand chatting as he escorted the departing guests to the door.  The\r\nice-wall was melting under the influence of coming separation, and never\r\nhad he looked more adorably handsome in her eyes, never had his merry\r\nlaugh and mischief-loving gaiety seemed more infectious than on this\r\nnight of his farewell banquet.  She was glad enough that he was going\r\naway from a life of idleness and extravagance and temptation, but she\r\nbegan to suspect that she would miss, for a little while at any rate, the\r\nhigh-spirited boy who could be so attractive in his better moods.  Her\r\nimpulse, after the guests had gone, was to call him to her and hold him\r\nonce more in her arms, and repeat her wishes for his happiness and\r\ngood-luck in the land he was going to, and her promise of his welcome\r\nback, some not too distant day, to the land he was leaving.  She wanted\r\nto forget, and to make him forget, the months of irritable jangling and\r\nsharp discussions, the months of cold aloofness and indifference and to\r\nremember only that he was her own dear Comus as in the days of yore,\r\nbefore he had grown from an unmanageable pickle into a weariful problem.\r\nBut she feared lest she should break down, and she did not wish to cloud\r\nhis light-hearted gaiety on the very eve of his departure.  She watched\r\nhim for a moment as he stood in the hall, settling his tie before a\r\nmirror, and then went quietly back to her drawing-room.  It had not been\r\na very successful dinner party, and the general effect it had left on her\r\nwas one of depression.\r\n\r\nComus, with a lively musical-comedy air on his lips, and a look of\r\nwretchedness in his eyes, went out to visit the haunts that he was\r\nleaving so soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nELAINE YOUGHAL sat at lunch in the Speise Saal of one of Vienna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncostlier hotels.  The double-headed eagle, with its \xe2\x80\x9cK.u.K.\xe2\x80\x9d legend,\r\neverywhere met the eye and announced the imperial favour in which the\r\nestablishment basked.  Some several square yards of yellow bunting,\r\ncharged with the image of another double-headed eagle, floating from the\r\nhighest flag-staff above the building, betrayed to the initiated the fact\r\nthat a Russian Grand Duke was concealed somewhere on the premises.\r\nUnannounced by heraldic symbolism but unconcealable by reason of nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown blazonry, were several citizens and citizenesses of the great\r\nrepublic of the Western world.  One or two Cobdenite members of the\r\nBritish Parliament engaged in the useful task of proving that the cost of\r\nliving in Vienna was on an exorbitant scale, flitted with restrained\r\nimportance through a land whose fatness they had come to spy out; every\r\nfancied over-charge in their bills was welcome as providing another nail\r\nin the coffin of their fiscal opponents.  It is the glory of democracies\r\nthat they may be misled but never driven.  Here and there, like brave\r\ndeeds in a dust-patterned world, flashed and glittered the sumptuous\r\nuniforms of representatives of the Austrian military caste.  Also in\r\nevidence, at discreet intervals, were stray units of the Semetic tribe\r\nthat nineteen centuries of European neglect had been unable to mislay.\r\n\r\nElaine sitting with Courtenay at an elaborately appointed luncheon table,\r\ngay with high goblets of Bohemian glassware, was mistress of three\r\ndiscoveries.  First, to her disappointment, that if you frequent the more\r\nexpensive hotels of Europe you must be prepared to find, in whatever\r\ncountry you may chance to be staying, a depressing international likeness\r\nbetween them all.  Secondly, to her relief, that one is not expected to\r\nbe sentimentally amorous during a modern honeymoon.  Thirdly, rather to\r\nher dismay, that Courtenay Youghal did not necessarily expect her to be\r\nmarkedly affectionate in private.  Someone had described him, after their\r\nmarriage, as one of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s bachelors, and she began to see how aptly\r\nthe description fitted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill those Germans on our left never stop talking?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as an\r\nundying flow of Teutonic small talk rattled and jangled across the\r\nintervening stretch of carpet.  \xe2\x80\x9cNot one of those three women has ceased\r\ntalking for an instant since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will presently, if only for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Courtenay; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the\r\ndish you have ordered comes in there will be a deathly silence at the\r\nnext table.  No German can see a _plat_ brought in for someone else\r\nwithout being possessed with a great fear that it represents a more\r\ntoothsome morsel or a better money\xe2\x80\x99s worth than what he has ordered for\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exuberant Teutonic chatter was balanced on the other side of the room\r\nby an even more penetrating conversation unflaggingly maintained by a\r\nparty of Americans, who were sitting in judgment on the cuisine of the\r\ncountry they were passing through, and finding few extenuating\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Mr. Lonkins wants is a real _deep_ cherry pie,\xe2\x80\x9d announced a lady in\r\na tone of dramatic and honest conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, that is so,\xe2\x80\x9d corroborated a gentleman who was apparently the\r\nMr. Lonkins in question; \xe2\x80\x9ca real _deep_ cherry pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had the same trouble way back in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed another lady;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clittle Jerome and the girls don\xe2\x80\x99t want to eat any more _cr\xc3\xa8me\r\nrenvers\xc3\xa9e_.  I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything if they could get some real cherry pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReal _deep_ cherry pie,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr. Lonkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWay down in Ohio we used to have peach pie that was real good,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Lonkins, turning on a tap of reminiscence that presently flowed to a\r\ncascade.  The subject of pies seemed to lend itself to indefinite\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo those people think of nothing but their food?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Elaine, as the\r\nvirtues of roasted mutton suddenly came to the fore and received emphatic\r\nrecognition, even the absent and youthful Jerome being quoted in its\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Courtenay, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are a widely-travelled set, and\r\nthe man has had a notably interesting career.  It is a form of\r\nhome-sickness with them to discuss and lament the cookery and foods that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve never had the leisure to stay at home and digest.  The Wandering\r\nJew probably babbled unremittingly about some breakfast dish that took so\r\nlong to prepare that he had never time to eat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA waiter deposited a dish of Wiener Nierenbraten in front of Elaine.  At\r\nthe same moment a magic hush fell upon the three German ladies at the\r\nadjoining table, and the flicker of a great fear passed across their\r\neyes.  Then they burst forth again into tumultuous chatter.  Courtenay\r\nhad proved a reliable prophet.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment as the luncheon-dish appeared on the scene, two\r\nladies arrived at a neighbouring table, and bowed with dignified\r\ncordiality to Elaine and Courtenay.  They were two of the more worldly\r\nand travelled of Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s extensive stock of aunts, and they happened to\r\nbe making a short stay at the same hotel as the young couple.  They were\r\nfar too correct and rationally minded to intrude themselves on their\r\nniece, but it was significant of Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s altered view as to the sanctity\r\nof honeymoon life that she secretly rather welcomed the presence of her\r\ntwo relatives in the hotel, and had found time and occasion to give them\r\nmore of her society than she would have considered necessary or desirable\r\na few weeks ago.  The younger of the two she rather liked, in a\r\nrestrained fashion, as one likes an unpretentious watering-place or a\r\nrestaurant that does not try to give one a musical education in addition\r\nto one\xe2\x80\x99s dinner.  One felt instinctively about her that she would never\r\nwear rather more valuable diamonds than any other woman in the room, and\r\nwould never be the only person to be saved in a steamboat disaster or\r\nhotel fire.  As a child she might have been perfectly well able to recite\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Linden when the sun was low,\xe2\x80\x9d but one felt certain that nothing ever\r\ninduced her to do so.  The elder aunt, Mrs. Goldbrook, did not share her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s character as a human rest-cure; most people found her rather\r\ndisturbing, chiefly, perhaps, from her habit of asking unimportant\r\nquestions with enormous solemnity.  Her manner of enquiring after a\r\ntrifling ailment gave one the impression that she was more concerned with\r\nthe fortunes of the malady than with oneself, and when one got rid of a\r\ncold one felt that she almost expected to be given its postal address.\r\nProbably her manner was merely the defensive outwork of an innate\r\nshyness, but she was not a woman who commanded confidences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA telephone call for Courtenay,\xe2\x80\x9d commented the younger of the two women\r\nas Youghal hurriedly flashed through the room; \xe2\x80\x9cthe telephone system\r\nseems to enter very largely into that young man\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe telephone has robbed matrimony of most of its sting,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nelder; \xe2\x80\x9cso much more discreet than pen and ink communications which get\r\nread by the wrong people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine\xe2\x80\x99s aunts were conscientiously worldly; they were the natural\r\noutcome of a stock that had been conscientiously straight-laced for many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nElaine had progressed to the pancake stage before Courtenay returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry to be away so long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged something rather\r\nnice for to-night.  There\xe2\x80\x99s rather a jolly masquerade ball on.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n\xe2\x80\x99phoned about getting a costume for you and it\xe2\x80\x99s alright.  It will suit\r\nyou beautifully, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my harlequin dress with me.  Madame\r\nKelnicort, excellent soul, is going to chaperone you, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll take you\r\nback any time you like; I\xe2\x80\x99m quite unreliable when I get into fancy dress.\r\nI shall probably keep going till some unearthly hour of the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA masquerade ball in a strange city hardly represented Elaine\xe2\x80\x99s idea of\r\nenjoyment.  Carefully to disguise one\xe2\x80\x99s identity in a neighbourhood where\r\none was entirely unknown seemed to her rather meaningless.  With\r\nCourtenay, of course, it was different; he seemed to have friends and\r\nacquaintances everywhere.  However, the matter had progressed to a point\r\nwhich would have made a refusal to go seem rather ungracious.  Elaine\r\nfinished her pancake and began to take a polite interest in her costume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your character?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame Kelnicort that evening, as they\r\nuncloaked, preparatory to entering the already crowded ball-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to represent Marjolaine de Montfort, whoever she\r\nmay have been,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine.  \xe2\x80\x9cCourtenay declares he only wanted to marry\r\nme because I\xe2\x80\x99m his ideal of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what a mistake to go as a character you know nothing about.  To\r\nenjoy a masquerade ball you ought to throw away your own self and be the\r\ncharacter you represent.  Now Courtenay has been Harlequin since half-way\r\nthrough dinner; I could see it dancing in his eyes.  At about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nto-morrow morning he will fall asleep and wake up a member of the British\r\nHouse of Parliament on his honeymoon, but to-night he is unrestrainedly\r\nHarlequin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine stood in the ball-room surrounded by a laughing jostling throng of\r\npierrots, jockeys, Dresden-china shepherdesses, Roumanian peasant-girls\r\nand all the lively make-believe creatures that form the ingredients of a\r\nfancy-dress ball.  As she stood watching them she experienced a growing\r\nfeeling of annoyance, chiefly with herself.  She was assisting, as the\r\nFrench say, at one of the gayest scenes of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s gayest capital, and\r\nshe was conscious of being absolutely unaffected by the gaiety around\r\nher.  The costumes were certainly interesting to look at, and the music\r\ngood to listen to, and to that extent she was amused, but the _abandon_\r\nof the scene made no appeal to her.  It was like watching a game of which\r\nyou did not know the rules, and in the issue of which you were not\r\ninterested.  Elaine began to wonder what was the earliest moment at which\r\nshe could drag Madame Kelnicort away from the revel without being guilty\r\nof sheer cruelty.  Then Courtenay wriggled out of the crush and came\r\ntowards her, a joyous laughing Courtenay, looking younger and handsomer\r\nthan she had ever seen him.  She could scarcely recognise in him to-night\r\nthe rising young debater who made embarrassing onslaughts on the\r\nGovernment\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy before a crowded House of Commons.  He\r\nclaimed her for the dance that was just starting, and steered her\r\ndexterously into the heart of the waltzing crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look more like Marjolaine than I should have thought a mortal woman\r\nof these days could look,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, \xe2\x80\x9conly Marjolaine did smile\r\nsometimes.  You have rather the air of wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99d left out enough\r\ntea for the servants\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my teasing; I love you to\r\nlook like that, and besides, it makes a splendid foil to my Harlequin\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nselfishness coming to the fore again, you see.  But you really are to go\r\nhome the moment you\xe2\x80\x99re bored; the excellent Kelnicort gets heaps of\r\ndances throughout the winter, so don\xe2\x80\x99t mind sacrificing her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little later in the evening Elaine found herself standing out a dance\r\nwith a grave young gentleman from the Russian Embassy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Courtenay enjoys himself, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, as the\r\nyouthful-looking harlequin flashed past them, looking like some restless\r\ngorgeous-hued dragonfly; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy is it that the good God has given your\r\ncountrymen the boon of eternal youth?  Some of your countrywomen, too,\r\nbut all of the men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine could think of many of her countrymen who were not and never could\r\nhave been youthful, but as far as Courtenay was concerned she recognised\r\nthe fitness of the remark.  And the recognition carried with it a sense\r\nof depression.  Would he always remain youthful and keen on gaiety and\r\nrevelling while she grew staid and retiring?  She had thrust the lively\r\nintractable Comus out of her mind, as by his perverseness he had thrust\r\nhimself out of her heart, and she had chosen the brilliant young man of\r\naffairs as her husband.  He had honestly let her see the selfish side of\r\nhis character while he was courting her, but she had been prepared to\r\nmake due sacrifices to the selfishness of a public man who had his career\r\nto consider above all other things.  Would she also have to make\r\nsacrifices to the harlequin spirit which was now revealing itself as an\r\nundercurrent in his nature?  When one has inured oneself to the idea of a\r\nparticular form of victimisation it is disconcerting to be confronted\r\nwith another.  Many a man who would patiently undergo martyrdom for\r\nreligion\xe2\x80\x99s sake would be furiously unwilling to be a martyr to neuralgia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that is why you English love animals so much,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the young\r\ndiplomat; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are such splendid animals yourselves.  You are lively\r\nbecause you want to be lively, not because people are looking on at you.\r\nMonsieur Courtenay is certainly an animal.  I mean it as a high\r\ncompliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I an animal?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Elaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to say you are an angel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Russian, in some\r\nembarrassment, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not think that would do; angels and animals\r\nwould never get on together.  To get on with animals you must have a\r\nsense of humour, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose angels have any sense of humour; you\r\nsee it would be no use to them as they never hear any jokes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elaine, with a tinge of bitterness in her voice, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\r\nI am a vegetable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you most remind me of a picture,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Russian.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time Elaine had heard the simile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Narrow Gallery at the Louvre; attributed to\r\nLeonardo da Vinci.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvidently the impression she made on people was solely one of externals.\r\n\r\nWas that how Courtenay regarded her?  Was that to be her function and\r\nplace in life, a painted background, a decorative setting to other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s triumphs and tragedies?  Somehow to-night she had the feeling\r\nthat a general might have who brought imposing forces into the field and\r\ncould do nothing with them.  She possessed youth and good looks,\r\nconsiderable wealth, and had just made what would be thought by most\r\npeople a very satisfactory marriage.  And already she seemed to be\r\nstanding aside as an onlooker where she had expected herself to be taking\r\na leading part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes this sort of thing appeal to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked the young Russian,\r\nnodding towards the gay scrimmage of masqueraders and rather prepared to\r\nhear an amused negative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9ccostume balls, fancy fairs, caf\xc3\xa9\r\nchantant, casino, anything that is not real life appeals to us Russians.\r\nReal life with us is the sort of thing that Maxim Gorki deals in.  It\r\ninterests us immensely, but we like to get away from it sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Kelnicort came up with another prospective partner, and Elaine\r\ndelivered her ukase: one more dance and then back to the hotel.  Without\r\nany special regret she made her retreat from the revel which Courtenay\r\nwas enjoying under the impression that it was life and the young Russian\r\nunder the firm conviction that it was not.\r\n\r\nElaine breakfasted at her aunts\xe2\x80\x99 table the next morning at much her usual\r\nhour.  Courtenay was sleeping the sleep of a happy tired animal.  He had\r\ngiven instructions to be called at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, from which time onward\r\nthe _Neue Freie Presse_, the _Zeit_, and his toilet would occupy his\r\nattention till he appeared at the luncheon table.  There were not many\r\npeople breakfasting when Elaine arrived on the scene, but the room seemed\r\nto be fuller than it really was by reason of a penetrating voice that was\r\nengaged in recounting how far the standard of Viennese breakfast fare\r\nfell below the expectations and desires of little Jerome and the girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ever little Jerome becomes President of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nElaine, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be able to contribute quite an informing article on his\r\ngastronomic likes and dislikes to the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe aunts were discreetly inquisitive as to the previous evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Elaine would flirt mildly with somebody it would be such a good\r\nthing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Goldbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cit would remind Courtenay that he\xe2\x80\x99s not the\r\nonly attractive young man in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElaine, however, did not gratify their hopes; she referred to the ball\r\nwith the detachment she would have shown in describing a drawing-room\r\nshow of cottage industries.  It was not difficult to discern in her\r\ndescription of the affair the confession that she had been slightly\r\nbored.  From Courtenay, later in the day, the aunts received a much\r\nlivelier impression of the festivities, from which it was abundantly\r\nclear that he at any rate had managed to amuse himself.  Neither did it\r\nappear that his good opinion of his own attractions had suffered any\r\nserious shock.  He was distinctly in a very good temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret of enjoying a honeymoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Goldbrook afterwards to\r\nher sister, \xe2\x80\x9cis not to attempt too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourtenay is content to try and keep one person amused and happy, and he\r\nthoroughly succeeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think Elaine is going to be very happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nsister, \xe2\x80\x9cbut at least Courtenay saved her from making the greatest\r\nmistake she could have made\xe2\x80\x94marrying that young Bassington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Goldbrook, \xe2\x80\x9chelped her to make the next biggest\r\nmistake of her life\xe2\x80\x94marrying Courtenay Youghal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was late afternoon by the banks of a swiftly rushing river, a river\r\nthat gave back a haze of heat from its waters as though it were some\r\nstagnant steaming lagoon, and yet seemed to be whirling onward with the\r\ndetermination of a living thing, perpetually eager and remorseless,\r\nleaping savagely at any obstacle that attempted to stay its course; an\r\nunfriendly river, to whose waters you committed yourself at your peril.\r\nUnder the hot breathless shade of the trees on its shore arose that acrid\r\nall-pervading smell that seems to hang everywhere about the tropics, a\r\nsmell as of some monstrous musty still-room where herbs and spices have\r\nbeen crushed and distilled and stored for hundreds of years, and where\r\nthe windows have seldom been opened.  In the dazzling heat that still\r\nheld undisputed sway over the scene, insects and birds seemed\r\npreposterously alive and active, flitting their gay colours through the\r\nsunbeams, and crawling over the baked dust in the full swing and pursuit\r\nof their several businesses; the flies engaged in Heaven knows what, and\r\nthe fly-catchers busy with the flies.  Beasts and humans showed no such\r\nindifference to the temperature; the sun would have to slant yet further\r\ndownward before the earth would become a fit arena for their revived\r\nactivities.  In the sheltered basement of a wayside rest-house a gang of\r\nnative hammock-bearers slept or chattered drowsily through the last hours\r\nof the long mid-day halt; wide awake, yet almost motionless in the thrall\r\nof a heavy lassitude, their European master sat alone in an upper\r\nchamber, staring out through a narrow window-opening at the native\r\nvillage, spreading away in thick clusters of huts girt around with\r\ncultivated vegetation.  It seemed a vast human ant-hill, which would\r\npresently be astir with its teeming human life, as though the Sun God in\r\nhis last departing stride had roused it with a careless kick.  Even as\r\nComus watched he could see the beginnings of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s awakening.\r\nWomen, squatting in front of their huts, began to pound away at the rice\r\nor maize that would form the evening meal, girls were collecting their\r\nwater pots preparatory to a walk down to the river, and enterprising\r\ngoats made tentative forays through gaps in the ill-kept fences of\r\nneighbouring garden plots; their hurried retreats showed that here at\r\nleast someone was keeping alert and wakeful vigil.  Behind a hut perched\r\non a steep hillside, just opposite to the rest-house, two boys were\r\nsplitting wood with a certain languid industry; further down the road a\r\ngroup of dogs were leisurely working themselves up to quarrelling pitch.\r\nHere and there, bands of evil-looking pigs roamed about, busy with\r\nforaging excursions that came unpleasantly athwart the border-line of\r\nscavenging.  And from the trees that bounded and intersected the village\r\nrose the horrible, tireless, spiteful-sounding squawking of the\r\niron-throated crows.\r\n\r\nComus sat and watched it all with a sense of growing aching depression.\r\nIt was so utterly trivial to his eyes, so devoid of interest, and yet it\r\nwas so real, so serious, so implacable in its continuity.  The brain grew\r\ntired with the thought of its unceasing reproduction.  It had all gone\r\non, as it was going on now, by the side of the great rushing swirling\r\nriver, this tilling and planting and harvesting, marketing and\r\nstore-keeping, feast-making and fetish-worship and love-making, burying\r\nand giving in marriage, child-bearing and child-rearing, all this had\r\nbeen going on, in the shimmering, blistering heat and the warm nights,\r\nwhile he had been a youngster at school, dimly recognising Africa as a\r\ndivision of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface that it was advisable to have a certain\r\nnodding acquaintance with.\r\n\r\nIt had been going on in all its trifling detail, all its serious\r\nintensity, when his father and his grandfather in their day had been\r\nlittle boys at school, it would go on just as intently as ever long after\r\nComus and his generation had passed away, just as the shadows would\r\nlengthen and fade under the mulberry trees in that far away English\r\ngarden, round the old stone fountain where a leaden otter for ever preyed\r\non a leaden salmon.\r\n\r\nComus rose impatiently from his seat, and walked wearily across the hut\r\nto another window-opening which commanded a broad view of the river.\r\nThere was something which fascinated and then depressed one in its\r\nceaseless hurrying onward sweep, its tons of water rushing on for all\r\ntime, as long as the face of the earth should remain unchanged.  On its\r\nfurther shore could be seen spread out at intervals other teeming\r\nvillages, with their cultivated plots and pasture clearings, their moving\r\ndots which meant cattle and goats and dogs and children.  And far up its\r\ncourse, lost in the forest growth that fringed its banks, were hidden\r\naway yet more villages, human herding-grounds where men dwelt and worked\r\nand bartered, squabbled and worshipped, sickened and perished, while the\r\nriver went by with its endless swirl and rush of gleaming waters.  One\r\ncould well understand primitive early races making propitiatory\r\nsacrifices to the spirit of a great river on whose shores they dwelt.\r\nTime and the river were the two great forces that seemed to matter here.\r\n\r\nIt was almost a relief to turn back to that other outlook and watch the\r\nvillage life that was now beginning to wake in earnest.  The procession\r\nof water-fetchers had formed itself in a long chattering line that\r\nstretched river-wards.  Comus wondered how many tens of thousands of\r\ntimes that procession had been formed since first the village came into\r\nexistence.  They had been doing it while he was playing in the\r\ncricket-fields at school, while he was spending Christmas holidays in\r\nParis, while he was going his careless round of theatres, dances, suppers\r\nand card-parties, just as they were doing it now; they would be doing it\r\nwhen there was no one alive who remembered Comus Bassington.  This\r\nthought recurred again and again with painful persistence, a morbid\r\ngrowth arising in part from his loneliness.\r\n\r\nStaring dumbly out at the toiling sweltering human ant-hill Comus\r\nmarvelled how missionary enthusiasts could labour hopefully at the work\r\nof transplanting their religion, with its homegrown accretions of\r\nfatherly parochial benevolence, in this heat-blistered, fever-scourged\r\nwilderness, where men lived like groundbait and died like flies.  Demons\r\none might believe in, if one did not hold one\xe2\x80\x99s imagination in healthy\r\ncheck, but a kindly all-managing God, never.  Somewhere in the west\r\ncountry of England Comus had an uncle who lived in a rose-smothered\r\nrectory and taught a wholesome gentle-hearted creed that expressed itself\r\nin the spirit of \xe2\x80\x9cLittle lamb, who made thee?\xe2\x80\x9d and faithfully reflected\r\nthe beautiful homely Christ-child sentiment of Saxon Europe.  What a far\r\naway, unreal fairy story it all seemed here in this West African land,\r\nwhere the bodies of men were of as little account as the bubbles that\r\nfloated on the oily froth of the great flowing river, and where it\r\nrequired a stretch of wild profitless imagination to credit them with\r\nundying souls.  In the life he had come from Comus had been accustomed to\r\nthink of individuals as definite masterful personalities, making their\r\nseveral marks on the circumstances that revolved around them; they did\r\nwell or ill, or in most cases indifferently, and were criticised,\r\npraised, blamed, thwarted or tolerated, or given way to.  In any case,\r\nhumdrum or outstanding, they had their spheres of importance, little or\r\nbig.  They dominated a breakfast table or harassed a Government,\r\naccording to their capabilities or opportunities, or perhaps they merely\r\nhad irritating mannerisms.  At any rate it seemed highly probable that\r\nthey had souls.  Here a man simply made a unit in an unnumbered\r\npopulation, an inconsequent dot in a loosely-compiled deathroll.  Even\r\nhis own position as a white man exalted conspicuously above a horde of\r\nblack natives did not save Comus from the depressing sense of nothingness\r\nwhich his first experience of fever had thrown over him.  He was a lost,\r\nsoulless body in this great uncaring land; if he died another would take\r\nhis place, his few effects would be inventoried and sent down to the\r\ncoast, someone else would finish off any tea or whisky that he left\r\nbehind\xe2\x80\x94that would be all.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly time to be starting towards the next halting place where he\r\nwould dine or at any rate eat something.  But the lassitude which the\r\nfever had bequeathed him made the tedium of travelling through\r\ninterminable forest-tracks a weariness to be deferred as long as\r\npossible.  The bearers were nothing loth to let another half-hour or so\r\nslip by, and Comus dragged a battered paper-covered novel from the pocket\r\nof his coat.  It was a story dealing with the elaborately tangled love\r\naffairs of a surpassingly uninteresting couple, and even in his almost\r\nbookless state Comus had not been able to plough his way through more\r\nthan two-thirds of its dull length; bound up with the cover, however,\r\nwere some pages of advertisement, and these the exile scanned with a\r\nhungry intentness that the romance itself could never have commanded.\r\nThe name of a shop, of a street, the address of a restaurant, came to him\r\nas a bitter reminder of the world he had lost, a world that ate and drank\r\nand flirted, gambled and made merry, a world that debated and intrigued\r\nand wire-pulled, fought or compromised political battles\xe2\x80\x94and recked\r\nnothing of its outcasts wandering through forest paths and steamy swamps\r\nor lying in the grip of fever.  Comus read and re-read those few lines of\r\nadvertisement, just as he treasured a much-crumpled programme of a\r\nfirst-night performance at the Straw Exchange Theatre; they seemed to\r\nmake a little more real the past that was already so shadowy and so\r\nutterly remote.  For a moment he could almost capture the sensation of\r\nbeing once again in those haunts that he loved; then he looked round and\r\npushed the book wearily from him.  The steaming heat, the forest, the\r\nrushing river hemmed him in on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe two boys who had been splitting wood ceased from their labours and\r\nstraightened their backs; suddenly the smaller of the two gave the other\r\na resounding whack with a split lath that he still held in his hand, and\r\nflew up the hillside with a scream of laughter and simulated terror, the\r\nbigger lad following in hot pursuit.  Up and down the steep bush-grown\r\nslope they raced and twisted and dodged, coming sometimes to close\r\nquarters in a hurricane of squeals and smacks, rolling over and over like\r\nfighting kittens, and breaking away again to start fresh provocation and\r\nfresh pursuit.  Now and again they would lie for a time panting in what\r\nseemed the last stage of exhaustion, and then they would be off in\r\nanother wild scamper, their dusky bodies flitting through the bushes,\r\ndisappearing and reappearing with equal suddenness.  Presently two girls\r\nof their own age, who had returned from the water-fetching, sprang out on\r\nthem from ambush, and the four joined in one joyous gambol that lit up\r\nthe hillside with shrill echoes and glimpses of flying limbs.  Comus sat\r\nand watched, at first with an amused interest, then with a returning\r\nflood of depression and heart-ache.  Those wild young human kittens\r\nrepresented the joy of life, he was the outsider, the lonely alien,\r\nwatching something in which he could not join, a happiness in which he\r\nhad no part or lot.  He would pass presently out of the village and his\r\nbearers\xe2\x80\x99 feet would leave their indentations in the dust; that would be\r\nhis most permanent memorial in this little oasis of teeming life.  And\r\nthat other life, in which he once moved with such confident sense of his\r\nown necessary participation in it, how completely he had passed out of\r\nit.  Amid all its laughing throngs, its card parties and race-meetings\r\nand country-house gatherings, he was just a mere name, remembered or\r\nforgotten, Comus Bassington, the boy who went away.  He had loved himself\r\nvery well and never troubled greatly whether anyone else really loved\r\nhim, and now he realised what he had made of his life.  And at the same\r\ntime he knew that if his chance were to come again he would throw it away\r\njust as surely, just as perversely.  Fate played with him with loaded\r\ndice; he would lose always.\r\n\r\nOne person in the whole world had cared for him, for longer than he could\r\nremember, cared for him perhaps more than he knew, cared for him perhaps\r\nnow.  But a wall of ice had mounted up between him and her, and across it\r\nthere blew that cold-breath that chills or kills affection.\r\n\r\nThe words of a well-known old song, the wistful cry of a lost cause, rang\r\nwith insistent mockery through his brain:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBetter loved you canna be,\r\n    Will ye ne\xe2\x80\x99er come back again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf it was love that was to bring him back he must be an exile for ever.\r\nHis epitaph in the mouths of those that remembered him would be, Comus\r\nBassington, the boy who never came back.\r\n\r\nAnd in his unutterable loneliness he bowed his head on his arms, that he\r\nmight not see the joyous scrambling frolic on yonder hillside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE bleak rawness of a grey December day held sway over St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Park,\r\nthat sanctuary of lawn and tree and pool, into which the bourgeois\r\ninnovator has rushed ambitiously time and again, to find that he must\r\ntake the patent leather from off his feet, for the ground on which he\r\nstands is hallowed ground.\r\n\r\nIn the lonely hour of early afternoon, when the workers had gone back to\r\ntheir work, and the loiterers were scarcely yet gathered again, Francesca\r\nBassington made her way restlessly along the stretches of gravelled walk\r\nthat bordered the ornamental water.  The overmastering unhappiness that\r\nfilled her heart and stifled her thinking powers found answering echo in\r\nher surroundings.  There is a sorrow that lingers in old parks and\r\ngardens that the busy streets have no leisure to keep by them; the dead\r\nmust bury their dead in Whitehall or the Place de la Concorde, but there\r\nare quieter spots where they may still keep tryst with the living and\r\nintrude the memory of their bygone selves on generations that have almost\r\nforgotten them.  Even in tourist-trampled Versailles the desolation of a\r\ntragedy that cannot die haunts the terraces and fountains like a\r\nbloodstain that will not wash out; in the Saxon Garden at Warsaw there\r\nbroods the memory of long-dead things, coeval with the stately trees that\r\nshade its walks, and with the carp that swim to-day in its ponds as they\r\ndoubtless swam there when \xe2\x80\x9cLieber Augustin\xe2\x80\x9d was a living person and not\r\nas yet an immortal couplet.  And St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Park, with its lawns and\r\nwalks and waterfowl, harbours still its associations with a bygone order\r\nof men and women, whose happiness and sadness are woven into its history,\r\ndim and grey as they were once bright and glowing, like the faded pattern\r\nworked into the fabric of an old tapestry.  It was here that Francesca\r\nhad made her way when the intolerable inaction of waiting had driven her\r\nforth from her home.  She was waiting for that worst news of all, the\r\nnews which does not kill hope, because there has been none to kill, but\r\nmerely ends suspense.  An early message had said that Comus was ill,\r\nwhich might have meant much or little; then there had come that morning a\r\ncablegram which only meant one thing; in a few hours she would get a\r\nfinal message, of which this was the preparatory forerunner.  She already\r\nknew as much as that awaited message would tell her.  She knew that she\r\nwould never see Comus again, and she knew now that she loved him beyond\r\nall things that the world could hold for her.  It was no sudden rush of\r\npity or compunction that clouded her judgment or gilded her recollection\r\nof him; she saw him as he was, the beautiful, wayward, laughing boy, with\r\nhis naughtiness, his exasperating selfishness, his insurmountable folly\r\nand perverseness, his cruelty that spared not even himself, and as he\r\nwas, as he always had been, she knew that he was the one thing that the\r\nFates had willed that she should love.  She did not stop to accuse or\r\nexcuse herself for having sent him forth to what was to prove his death.\r\nIt was, doubtless, right and reasonable that he should have gone out\r\nthere, as hundreds of other men went out, in pursuit of careers; the\r\nterrible thing was that he would never come back.  The old cruel\r\nhopelessness that had always chequered her pride and pleasure in his good\r\nlooks and high spirits and fitfully charming ways had dealt her a last\r\ncrushing blow; he was dying somewhere thousands of miles away without\r\nhope of recovery, without a word of love to comfort him, and without hope\r\nor shred of consolation she was waiting to hear of the end.  The end;\r\nthat last dreadful piece of news which would write \xe2\x80\x9cnevermore\xe2\x80\x9d across his\r\nlife and hers.\r\n\r\nThe lively bustle in the streets had been a torture that she could not\r\nbear.  It wanted but two days to Christmas and the gaiety of the season,\r\nforced or genuine, rang out everywhere.  Christmas shopping, with its\r\nanxious solicitude or self-centred absorption, overspread the West End\r\nand made the pavements scarcely passable at certain favoured points.\r\nProud parents, parcel-laden and surrounded by escorts of their young\r\npeople, compared notes with one another on the looks and qualities of\r\ntheir offspring and exchanged loud hurried confidences on the difficulty\r\nor success which each had experienced in getting the right presents for\r\none and all.  Shouted directions where to find this or that article at\r\nits best mingled with salvos of Christmas good wishes.  To Francesca,\r\nmaking her way frantically through the carnival of happiness with that\r\nlonely deathbed in her eyes, it had seemed a callous mockery of her pain;\r\ncould not people remember that there were crucifixions as well as joyous\r\nbirthdays in the world?  Every mother that she passed happy in the\r\ncompany of a fresh-looking clean-limbed schoolboy son sent a fresh stab\r\nat her heart, and the very shops had their bitter memories.  There was\r\nthe tea-shop where he and she had often taken tea together, or, in the\r\ndays of their estrangement, sat with their separate friends at separate\r\ntables.  There were other shops where extravagantly-incurred bills had\r\nfurnished material for those frequently recurring scenes of\r\nrecrimination, and the Colonial outfitters, where, as he had phrased it\r\nin whimsical mockery, he had bought grave-clothes for his burying-alive.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9coubliette!\xe2\x80\x9d  She remembered the bitter petulant name he had flung at\r\nhis destined exile.  There at least he had been harder on himself than\r\nthe Fates were pleased to will; never, as long as Francesca lived and had\r\na brain that served her, would she be able to forget.  That narcotic\r\nwould never be given to her.  Unrelenting, unsparing memory would be with\r\nher always to remind her of those last days of tragedy.  Already her mind\r\nwas dwelling on the details of that ghastly farewell dinner-party and\r\nrecalling one by one the incidents of ill-omen that had marked it; how\r\nthey had sat down seven to table and how one liqueur glass in the set of\r\nseven had been shivered into fragments; how her glass had slipped from\r\nher hand as she raised it to her lips to wish Comus a safe return; and\r\nthe strange, quiet hopelessness of Lady Veula\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye\xe2\x80\x9d; she\r\nremembered now how it had chilled and frightened her at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe park was filling again with its floating population of loiterers, and\r\nFrancesca\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps began to take a homeward direction.  Something\r\nseemed to tell her that the message for which she waited had arrived and\r\nwas lying there on the hall table.  Her brother, who had announced his\r\nintention of visiting her early in the afternoon would have gone by now;\r\nhe knew nothing of this morning\xe2\x80\x99s bad news\xe2\x80\x94the instinct of a wounded\r\nanimal to creep away by itself had prompted her to keep her sorrow from\r\nhim as long as possible.  His visit did not necessitate her presence; he\r\nwas bringing an Austrian friend, who was compiling a work on the\r\nFranco-Flemish school of painting, to inspect the Van der Meulen, which\r\nHenry Greech hoped might perhaps figure as an illustration in the book.\r\nThey were due to arrive shortly after lunch, and Francesca had left a\r\nnote of apology, pleading an urgent engagement elsewhere.  As she turned\r\nto make her way across the Mall into the Green Park a gentle voice hailed\r\nher from a carriage that was just drawing up by the sidewalk.  Lady\r\nCaroline Benaresq had been favouring the Victoria Memorial with a long\r\nunfriendly stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn primitive days,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it was the fashion for\r\ngreat chiefs and rulers to have large numbers of their relatives and\r\ndependents killed and buried with them; in these more enlightened times\r\nwe have invented quite another way of making a great Sovereign\r\nuniversally regretted.  My dear Francesca,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off suddenly,\r\ncatching the misery that had settled in the other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the\r\nmatter?  Have you had bad news from out there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting for very bad news,\xe2\x80\x9d said Francesca, and Lady Caroline knew\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could say something; I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lady Caroline spoke in a harsh,\r\ngrunting voice that few people had ever heard her use.\r\n\r\nFrancesca crossed the Mall and the carriage drove on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven help that poor woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Caroline; which was, for her,\r\nstartlingly like a prayer.\r\n\r\nAs Francesca entered the hall she gave a quick look at the table; several\r\npackages, evidently an early batch of Christmas presents, were there, and\r\ntwo or three letters.  On a salver by itself was the cablegram for which\r\nshe had waited.  A maid, who had evidently been on the lookout for her,\r\nbrought her the salver.  The servants were well aware of the dreadful\r\nthing that was happening, and there was pity on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face and in\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis came for you ten minutes ago, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and Mr. Greech has been here,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, with another gentleman, and was sorry you weren\xe2\x80\x99t at home.  Mr.\r\nGreech said he would call again in about half-an-hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca carried the cablegram unopened into the drawing-room and sat\r\ndown for a moment to think.  There was no need to read it yet, for she\r\nknew what she would find written there.  For a few pitiful moments Comus\r\nwould seem less hopelessly lost to her if she put off the reading of that\r\nlast terrible message.  She rose and crossed over to the windows and\r\npulled down the blinds, shutting out the waning December day, and then\r\nreseated herself.  Perhaps in the shadowy half-light her boy would come\r\nand sit with her again for awhile and let her look her last upon his\r\nloved face; she could never touch him again or hear his laughing,\r\npetulant voice, but surely she might look on her dead.  And her starving\r\neyes saw only the hateful soulless things of bronze and silver and\r\nporcelain that she had set up and worshipped as gods; look where she\r\nwould they were there around her, the cold ruling deities of the home\r\nthat held no place for her dead boy.  He had moved in and out among them,\r\nthe warm, living, breathing thing that had been hers to love, and she had\r\nturned her eyes from that youthful comely figure to adore a few feet of\r\npainted canvas, a musty relic of a long departed craftsman.  And now he\r\nwas gone from her sight, from her touch, from her hearing for ever,\r\nwithout even a thought to flash between them for all the dreary years\r\nthat she should live, and these things of canvas and pigment and wrought\r\nmetal would stay with her.  They were her soul.  And what shall it profit\r\na man if he save his soul and slay his heart in torment?\r\n\r\nOn a small table by her side was Mervyn Quentock\xe2\x80\x99s portrait of her\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nprophetic symbol of her tragedy; the rich dead harvest of unreal things\r\nthat had never known life, and the bleak thrall of black unending Winter,\r\na Winter in which things died and knew no re-awakening.\r\n\r\nFrancesca turned to the small envelope lying in her lap; very slowly she\r\nopened it and read the short message.  Then she sat numb and silent for a\r\nlong, long time, or perhaps only for minutes.  The voice of Henry Greech\r\nin the hall, enquiring for her, called her to herself. Hurriedly she\r\ncrushed the piece of paper out of sight; he would have to be told, of\r\ncourse, but just yet her pain seemed too dreadful to be laid bare.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComus is dead\xe2\x80\x9d was a sentence beyond her power to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have bad news for you, Francesca, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry announced.\r\nHad he heard, too?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenneberg has been here and looked at the picture,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nseating himself by her side, \xe2\x80\x9cand though he admired it immensely as a\r\nwork of art he gave me a disagreeable surprise by assuring me that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot a genuine Van der Meulen.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid copy, but still,\r\nunfortunately, only a copy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry paused and glanced at his sister to see how she had taken the\r\nunwelcome announcement.  Even in the dim light he caught some of the\r\nanguish in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Francesca,\xe2\x80\x9d he said soothingly, laying his hand affectionately\r\non her arm, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that this must be a great disappointment to you,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve always set such store by this picture, but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take it too\r\nmuch to heart.  These disagreeable discoveries come at times to most\r\npicture fanciers and owners.  Why, about twenty per cent. of the alleged\r\nOld Masters in the Louvre are supposed to be wrongly attributed.  And\r\nthere are heaps of similar cases in this country.  Lady Dovecourt was\r\ntelling me the other day that they simply daren\xe2\x80\x99t have an expert in to\r\nexamine the Van Dykes at Columbey for fear of unwelcome disclosures.  And\r\nbesides, your picture is such an excellent copy that it\xe2\x80\x99s by no means\r\nwithout a value of its own.  You must get over the disappointment you\r\nnaturally feel, and take a philosophical view of the matter. . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancesca sat in stricken silence, crushing the folded morsel of paper\r\ntightly in her hand and wondering if the thin, cheerful voice with its\r\npitiless, ghastly mockery of consolation would never stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE UNBEARABLE BASSINGTON***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 555-0.txt or 555-0.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/5/5/555\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
