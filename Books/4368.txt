From the western half of the sky the\r\nsun was shying little golden disks at the sea--if you gazed\r\nintently enough you could see them skip from wave tip to wave tip\r\nuntil they joined a broad collar of golden coin that was\r\ncollecting half a mile out and would eventually be a dazzling\r\nsunset. About half-way between the Florida shore and the golden\r\ncollar a white steam-yacht, very young and graceful, was riding\r\nat anchor and under a blue-and-white awning aft a yellow-haired\r\ngirl reclined in a wicker settee reading The Revolt of the\r\nAngels, by Anatole France.\r\n\r\nShe was about nineteen, slender and supple, with a spoiled\r\nalluring mouth and quick gray eyes full of a radiant curiosity.\r\nHer feet, stockingless, and adorned rather than clad in\r\nblue-satin slippers which swung nonchalantly from her toes, were\r\nperched on the arm of a settee adjoining the one she occupied.\r\nAnd as she read she intermittently regaled herself by a faint\r\napplication to her tongue of a half-lemon that she held in her\r\nhand. The other half, sucked dry, lay on the deck at her feet and\r\nrocked very gently to and fro at the almost imperceptible motion\r\nof the tide.\r\n\r\nThe second half-lemon was well-nigh pulpless and the golden\r\ncollar had grown astonishing in width, when suddenly the drowsy\r\nsilence which enveloped the yacht was broken by the sound of\r\nheavy footsteps and an elderly man topped with orderly gray hair\r\nand clad in a white-flannel suit appeared at the head of the\r\ncompanionway. There he paused for a moment until his eyes became\r\naccustomed to the sun, and then seeing the girl under the awning\r\nhe uttered a long even grunt of disapproval.\r\n\r\nIf he had intended thereby to obtain a rise of any sort he was\r\ndoomed to disappointment. The girl calmly turned over two pages,\r\nturned back one, raised the lemon mechanically to tasting\r\ndistance, and then very faintly but quite unmistakably yawned.\r\n\r\n"Ardita!" said the gray-haired man sternly.\r\n\r\nArdita uttered a small sound indicating nothing.\r\n\r\n"Ardita!" he repeated. "Ardita!"\r\n\r\nArdita raised the lemon languidly, allowing three words to slip\r\nout before it reached her tongue.\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up."\r\n\r\n"Ardita!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Will you listen to me--or will I have to get a servant to hold\r\nyou while I talk to you?"\r\n\r\nThe lemon descended very slowly and scornfully.\r\n\r\n"Put it in writing."\r\n\r\n"Will you have the decency to close that abominable book and\r\ndiscard that damn lemon for two minutes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, can\'t you lemme alone for a second?"\r\n\r\n"Ardita, I have just received a telephone message from the\r\nshore---"\r\n\r\n"Telephone?" She showed for the first time a faint interest.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was---"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say," she interrupted wonderingly, "\'at they let\r\nyou run a wire out here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and just now---"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t other boats bump into it?"\r\n\r\n"No. It\'s run along the bottom. Five min---"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be darned! Gosh! Science is golden or\r\nsomething--isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Will you let me say what I started to?"\r\n\r\n"Shoot!"\r\n\r\n"Well it seems--well, I am up here--" He paused and swallowed\r\nseveral times distractedly. "Oh, yes. Young woman, Colonel\r\nMoreland has called up again to ask me to be sure to bring you in\r\nto dinner. His son Toby has come all the way from New York to\r\nmeet you and he\'s invited several other young people. For the\r\nlast time, will you---"\r\n\r\n"No," said Ardita shortly, "I won\'t. I came along on this darn\r\ncruise with the one idea of going to Palm Beach, and you knew it,\r\nand I absolutely refuse to meet any darn old colonel or any darn\r\nyoung Toby or any darn old young people or to set foot in any\r\nother darn old town in this crazy state. So you either take me to\r\nPalm Beach or else shut up and go away."\r\n\r\n"Very well. This is the last straw. In your infatuation for this\r\nman.--a man who is notorious for his excesses--a man your father\r\nwould not have allowed to so much as mention your name--you have\r\nrejected the demi-monde rather than the circles in which you have\r\npresumably grown up. From now on---"\r\n\r\n"I know," interrupted Ardita ironically, "from now on you go your\r\nway and I go mine. I\'ve heard that story before. You know I\'d\r\nlike nothing better."\r\n\r\n"From now on," he announced grandiloquently, "you are no niece of\r\nmine. I---"\r\n\r\n"O-o-o-oh!" The cry was wrung from Ardita with the agony of a\r\nlost soul. "Will you stop boring me! Will you go \'way! Will you\r\njump overboard and drown! Do you want me to throw this book at\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"If you dare do any---"\r\n\r\nSmack! The Revolt of the Angels sailed through the air, missed\r\nits target by the length of a short nose, and bumped cheerfully\r\ndown the companionway.\r\n\r\nThe gray-haired man made an instinctive step backward and then\r\ntwo cautious steps forward. Ardita jumped to her five feet four\r\nand stared at him defiantly, her gray eyes blazing.\r\n\r\n"Keep off!"\r\n\r\n"How dare you!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Because I darn please!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve grown unbearable! Your disposition---"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve made me that way! No child ever has a bad disposition\r\nunless it\'s her fancy\'s fault! Whatever I am, you did it."\r\n\r\nMuttering something under his breath her uncle turned and,\r\nwalking forward called in a loud voice for the launch. Then he\r\nreturned to the awning, where Ardita had again seated herself and\r\nresumed her attention to the lemon.\r\n\r\n"I am going ashore," he said slowly. "I will be out again at nine\r\no\'clock to-night. When I return we start back to New York,\r\nwither I shall turn you over to your aunt for the rest of your\r\nnatural, or rather unnatural, life."  He paused and looked at\r\nher, and then all at once something in the utter childness of her\r\nbeauty seemed to puncture his anger like an inflated tire, and\r\nrender him helpless, uncertain, utterly fatuous.\r\n\r\n"Ardita," he said not unkindly, "I\'m no fool. I\'ve been round. I\r\nknow men. And, child, confirmed libertines don\'t reform until\r\nthey\'re tired--and then they\'re not themselves--they\'re husks of\r\nthemselves." He looked at her as if expecting agreement, but\r\nreceiving no sight or sound of it he continued. "Perhaps the man\r\nloves you--that\'s possible. He\'s loved many women and he\'ll love\r\nmany more. Less than a month ago, one month, Ardita, he was\r\ninvolved in a notorious affair with that red-haired woman, Mimi\r\nMerril; promised to give her the diamond bracelet that the Czar\r\nof Russia gave his mother. You know--you read the papers."\r\n\r\n"Thrilling scandals by an anxious uncle," yawned Ardita. "Have it\r\nfilmed. Wicked clubman making eyes at virtuous flapper. Virtuous\r\nflapper conclusively vamped by his lurid past. Plans to meet him\r\nat Palm Beach. Foiled by anxious uncle."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me why the devil you want to marry him?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I couldn\'t say," said Audits shortly. "Maybe because\r\nhe\'s the only man I know, good or bad, who has an imagination and\r\nthe courage of his convictions. Maybe it\'s to get away from the\r\nyoung fools that spend their vacuous hours pursuing me around the\r\ncountry. But as for the famous Russian bracelet, you can set\r\nyour mind at rest on that score. He\'s going to give it to me at\r\nPalm Beach--if you\'ll show a little intelligence."\r\n\r\n"How about the--red-haired woman?"\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t seen her for six months," she said angrily. "Don\'t you\r\nsuppose I have enough pride to see to that? Don\'t you know by\r\nthis time that I can do any darn thing with any darn man I want\r\nto?"\r\n\r\nShe put her chin in the air like the statue of France Aroused,\r\nand then spoiled the pose somewhat by raising the lemon for\r\naction.\r\n\r\n"Is it the Russian bracelet that fascinates you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m merely trying to give you the sort of argument that\r\nwould appeal to your intelligence. And I wish you\'d go \'way," she\r\nsaid, her temper rising again. "You know I never change my mind.\r\nYou\'ve been boring me for three days until I\'m about to go\r\ncrazy. I won\'t go ashore! Won\'t! Do you hear? Won\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Very well," he said, "and you won\'t go to Palm Beach either. Of\r\nall the selfish, spoiled, uncontrolled disagreeable, impossible\r\ngirl I have---"\r\n\r\nSplush! The half-lemon caught him in the neck. Simultaneously\r\ncame a hail from over the side.\r\n\r\n"The launch is ready, Mr. Farnam."\r\n\r\nToo full of words and rage to speak, Mr. Farnam cast one utterly\r\ncondemning glance at his niece and, turning, ran swiftly down the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock robed down from the sun and plumped soundlessly into\r\nthe sea. The golden collar widened into a glittering island; and\r\na faint breeze that had been playing with the edges of the\r\nawning and swaying one of the dangling blue slippers became\r\nsuddenly freighted with song. It was a chorus of men in close\r\nharmony and in perfect rhythm to an accompanying sound of oars\r\ndealing the blue writers. Ardita lifted her head and listened.\r\n\r\n     "Carrots and Peas,\r\n      Beans on their knees,\r\n      Pigs in the seas,\r\n          Lucky fellows!\r\n      Blow us a breeze,\r\n      Blow us a breeze,\r\n      Blow us a breeze,\r\n          With your bellows."\r\n\r\nArdita\'s brow wrinkled in astonishment. Sitting very still she\r\nlistened eagerly as the chorus took up a second verse.\r\n\r\n     "Onions and beans,\r\n      Marshalls and Deans,\r\n      Goldbergs and Greens\r\n          And Costellos.\r\n      Blow us a breeze,\r\n      Blow us a breeze,\r\n      Blow us a breeze,\r\n          With your bellows."\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation she tossed her book to the desk, where it\r\nsprawled at a straddle, and hurried to the rail. Fifty feet away\r\na large rowboat was approaching containing seven men, six of them\r\nrowing and one standing up in the stern keeping time to their\r\nsong with an orchestra leader\'s baton.\r\n\r\n     "Oysters and Rocks,\r\n      Sawdust and socks,\r\n      Who could make clocks\r\n          Out of cellos?---"\r\n\r\nThe leader\'s eyes suddenly rested on Ardita, who was leaning over\r\nthe rail spellbound with curiosity. He made a quick movement\r\nwith his baton and the singing instantly ceased. She saw that he\r\nwas the only white man in the boat--the six rowers were negroes.\r\n\r\n"Narcissus ahoy!" he called politely.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the idea of all the discord?" demanded Ardita cheerfully.\r\n"Is this the varsity crew from the county nut farm?"\r\n\r\nBy this time the boat was scraping the side of the yacht and a\r\ngreat bulking negro in the bow turned round and grasped the\r\nladder. Thereupon the leader left his position in the stern and\r\nbefore Ardita had realized his intention he ran up the ladder and\r\nstood breathless before her on the deck.\r\n\r\n"The women and children will be spared!" he said briskly. "All\r\ncrying babies will be immediately drowned and all males put in\r\ndouble irons!" Digging her hands excitedly down into the pockets\r\nof her dress Ardita stared at him, speechless with astonishment.\r\nHe was a young man with a scornful mouth and the bright blue eyes\r\nof a healthy baby set in a dark sensitive face. His hair was\r\npitch black, damp and curly--the hair of a Grecian statue gone\r\nbrunette. He was trimly built, trimly dressed, and graceful as an\r\nagile quarter-back.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be a son of a gun!" she said dazedly.\r\n\r\nThey eyed each other coolly.\r\n\r\n"Do you surrender the ship?"\r\n\r\n"Is this an outburst of wit?" demanded Ardita. "Are you an\r\nidiot--or just being initiated to some fraternity?"\r\n\r\n"I asked you if you surrendered the ship."\r\n\r\n"I thought the country was dry," said Ardita disdainfully. "Have\r\nyou been drinking finger-nail enamel? You better get off this\r\nyacht!"\r\n\r\n"What?" the young man\'s voice expressed incredulity.\r\n\r\n"Get off the yacht! You heard me!"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment as if considering what she had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"No," said his scornful mouth slowly; "No, I won\'t get off the\r\nyacht. You can get off if you wish."\r\n\r\nGoing to the rail be gave a curt command and immediately the crew\r\nof the rowboat scrambled up the ladder and ranged themselves in\r\nline before him, a coal-black and burly darky at one end and a\r\nminiature mulatto of four feet nine at to other. They seemed to\r\nbe uniformly dressed in some sort of blue costume ornamented with\r\ndust, mud, and tatters; over the shoulder of each was slung a\r\nsmall, heavy-looking white sack, and under their arms they\r\ncarried large black cases apparently containing musical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n"\'Ten-SHUN!" commanded the young man, snapping his own heels\r\ntogether crisply. "Right DRISS! Front! Step out here, Babe!"\r\n\r\nThe smallest Negro took a quick step forward and saluted.\r\n\r\n"Take command, go down below, catch the crew and tie \'em up--all\r\nexcept the engineer. Bring him up to me. Oh, and pile those bags\r\nby the rail there."\r\n\r\n"Yas-suh!"\r\n\r\nBabe saluted again and wheeling about motioned for the five others\r\nto gather about him. Then after a short whispered consultation\r\nthey all filed noiselessly down the companionway.\r\n\r\n"Now," said the young man cheerfully to Ardita, who had witnessed\r\nthis last scene in withering silence, "if you will swear on your\r\nhonor as a flapper--which probably isn\'t worth much--that you\'ll\r\nkeep that spoiled little mouth of yours tight shut for\r\nforty-eight hours, you can row yourself ashore in our\r\nrowboat."\r\n\r\n"Otherwise what?"\r\n\r\n"Otherwise you\'re going to sea in a ship."\r\n\r\nWith a little sigh as for a crisis well passed, the young man\r\nsank into the settee Ardita had lately vacated and stretched his\r\narms lazily. The corners of his mouth relaxed appreciatively as\r\nhe looked round at the rich striped awning, the polished brass,\r\nand the luxurious fittings of the deck. His eye felt on the book,\r\nand then on the exhausted lemon.\r\n\r\n"Hm," he said, "Stonewall Jackson claimed that lemon-juice\r\ncleared his head. Your head feel pretty clear?"\r\n\r\nArdita disdained to answer.\r\n\r\n"Because inside of five minutes you\'ll have to make a clear\r\ndecision whether it\'s go or stay."\r\n\r\nHe picked up the book and opened it curiously.\r\n\r\n"The Revolt of the Angels. Sounds pretty good. French, eh?" He\r\nstared at her with new interest "You French?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Farnam."\r\n\r\n"Farnam what?"\r\n\r\n"Ardita Farnam."\r\n\r\n"Well Ardita, no use standing up there and chewing out the\r\ninsides of your mouth. You ought to break those nervous habits\r\nwhile you\'re young. Come over here and sit down."\r\n\r\nArdita took a carved jade case from her pocket, extracted a\r\ncigarette and lit it with a conscious coolness, though she knew\r\nher hand was trembling a little; then she crossed over with her\r\nsupple, swinging walk, and sitting down in the other settee blew\r\na mouthful of smoke at the awning.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t get me off this yacht," she raid steadily; "and you\r\nhaven\'t got very much sense if you think you\'ll get far with it.\r\nMy uncle\'ll have wirelesses zigzagging all over this ocean by\r\nhalf past six."\r\n\r\n"Hm."\r\n\r\nShe looked quickly at his face, caught anxiety stamped there\r\nplainly in the faintest depression of the mouth\'s corners.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all the same to me," she said, shrugging her shoulders.\r\n"\'Tisn\'t my yacht. I don\'t mind going for a coupla hours\' cruise.\r\nI\'ll even lend you that book so you\'ll have something to read on\r\nthe revenue boat that takes you up to Sing-Sing."\r\n\r\nHe laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n"If that\'s advice you needn\'t bother. This is part of a plan\r\narranged before I ever knew this yacht existed. If it hadn\'t been\r\nthis one it\'d have been the next one we passed anchored along\r\nthe coast."\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" demanded Ardita suddenly. "And what are you?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve decided not to go ashore?"\r\n\r\n"I never even faintly considered it."\r\n\r\n"We\'re generally known," he said "all seven of us, as Curtis\r\nCarlyle and his Six Black Buddies late of the Winter Garden and\r\nthe Midnight Frolic."\r\n\r\n"You\'re singers?"\r\n\r\n"We were until to-day. At present, due to those white bags you\r\nsee there we\'re fugitives from justice and if the reward offered\r\nfor our capture hasn\'t by this time reached twenty thousand\r\ndollars I miss my guess."\r\n\r\n"What\'s in the bags?" asked Ardita curiously.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said "for the present we\'ll call it--mud--Florida\r\nmud."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin ten minutes after Curtis Carlyle\'s interview with a very\r\nfrightened engineer the yacht Narcissus was under way, steaming\r\nsouth through a balmy tropical twilight. The little mulatto,\r\nBabe, who seems to have Carlyle\'s implicit confidence, took full\r\ncommand of the situation. Mr. Farnam\'s valet and the chef, the\r\nonly members of the crew on board except the engineer, having\r\nshown fight, were now reconsidering, strapped securely to their\r\nbunks below. Trombone Mose, the biggest negro, was set busy with\r\na can of paint obliterating the name Narcissus from the bow, and\r\nsubstituting the name Hula Hula, and the others congregated aft\r\nand became intently involved in a game of craps.\r\n\r\nHaving given order for a meal to be prepared and served on deck\r\nat seven-thirty, Carlyle rejoined Ardita, and, sinking back into\r\nhis settee, half closed his eyes and fell into a state of\r\nprofound abstraction.\r\n\r\nArdita scrutinized him carefully--and classed him immediately as\r\na romantic figure. He gave the effect of towering self-confidence\r\nerected on a slight foundation--just under the surface of each\r\nof his decisions she discerned a hesitancy that was in decided\r\ncontrast to the arrogant curl of his lips.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not like me," she thought "There\'s a difference somewhere."\r\nBeing a supreme egotist Ardita frequently thought about\r\nherself; never having had her egotism disputed she did it\r\nentirely naturally and with no detraction from her unquestioned\r\ncharm.  Though she was nineteen she gave the effect of a\r\nhigh-spirited precocious child, and in the present glow of her\r\nyouth and beauty all the men and women she had known were but\r\ndriftwood on the ripples of her temperament. She had met other\r\negotists--in fact she found that selfish people bored her rather\r\nless than unselfish people--but as yet there had not been one she\r\nhad not eventually defeated and brought to her feet.\r\n\r\nBut though she recognized an egotist in the settee, she felt none\r\nof that usual shutting of doors in her mind which meant clearing\r\nship for action; on the contrary her instinct told her that this\r\nman was somehow completely pregnable and quite defenseless. When\r\nArdita defied convention--and of late it had been her chief\r\namusement--it was from an intense desire to be herself, and she\r\nfelt that this man, on the contrary, was preoccupied with his own\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\nShe was much more interested in him than she was in her own\r\nsituation, which affected her as the prospect of a matine\xe9 might\r\naffect a ten-year-old child. She had implicit confidence in her\r\nability to take care of herself under any and all circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe night deepened. A pale new moon smiled misty-eyed upon the\r\nsea, and as the shore faded dimly out and dark clouds were blown\r\nlike leaves along the far horizon a great haze of moonshine\r\nsuddenly bathed the yacht and spread an avenue of glittering mail\r\nin her swift path. From time to time there was the bright flare\r\nof a match as one of them lighted a cigarette, but except for\r\nthe low under-tone of the throbbing engines and the even wash of\r\nthe waves about the stern the yacht was quiet as a dream boat\r\nstar-bound through the heavens. Round them bowed the smell of the\r\nnight sea, bringing with it an infinite languor.\r\n\r\nCarlyle broke the silence at last.\r\n\r\n"Lucky girl," he sighed "I\'ve always wanted to be rich--and buy\r\nall this beauty."\r\n\r\nArdita yawned.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather be you," she said frankly.\r\n\r\n"You would--for about a day. But you do seem to possess a lot of\r\nnerve for a flapper."\r\n\r\n"I wish you wouldn\'t call me that."\r\n\r\n"Beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"As to nerve," she continued slowly, "it\'s my one redeemiug\r\nfeature. I\'m not afraid of anything in heaven or earth."\r\n\r\n"Hm, I am."\r\n\r\n"To be afraid," said Ardita, "a person has either to be very\r\ngreat and strong--or else a coward. I\'m neither." She paused for\r\na moment, and eagerness crept into her tone. "But I want to talk\r\nabout you. What on earth have you done--and how did you do it?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" he demanded cynically.  "Going to write a movie, about\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Go on," she urged. "Lie to me by the moonlight. Do a fabulous\r\nstory."\r\n\r\nA negro appeared, switched on a string of small lights under the\r\nawning, and began setting the wicker table for supper. And while\r\nthey ate cold sliced chicken, salad, artichokes and strawberry\r\njam from the plentiful larder below, Carlyle began to talk,\r\nhesitatingly at first, but eagerly as he saw she was interested.\r\nArdita scarcely touched her food as she watched his dark young\r\nface--handsome, ironic faintly ineffectual.\r\n\r\nHe began life as a poor kid in a Tennessee town, he said, so poor\r\nthat his people were the only white family in their street. He\r\nnever remembered any white children--but there were inevitably a\r\ndozen pickaninnies streaming in his trail, passionate admirers\r\nwhom he kept in tow by the vividness of his imagination and the\r\namount of trouble he was always getting them in and out of. And\r\nit seemed that this association diverted a rather unusual musical\r\ngift into a strange channel.\r\n\r\nThere had been a colored woman named Belle Pope Calhoun who\r\nplayed the piano at parties given for white children--nice white\r\nchildren that would have passed Curtis Carlyle with a sniff. But\r\nthe ragged little "poh white" used to sit beside her piano by the\r\nhour and try to get in an alto with one of those kazoos that\r\nboys hum through. Before he was thirteen he was picking up a\r\nliving teasing ragtime out of a battered violin in little caf\xe9s\r\nround Nashville. Eight years later the ragtime craze hit the\r\ncountry, and he took six darkies on the Orpheum circuit. Five of\r\nthem were boys he had grown up with; the other was the little\r\nmulatto, Babe Divine, who was a wharf nigger round New York, and\r\nlong before that a plantation hand in Bermuda, until he stuck an\r\neight-inch stiletto in his master\'s back. Almost before Carlyle\r\nrealized his good fortune he was on Broadway, with offers of\r\nengagements on all sides, and more money than he had ever dreamed\r\nof.\r\n\r\nIt was about then that a change began in his whole attitude, a\r\nrather curious, embittering change. It was when he realized that\r\nhe was spending the golden years of his life gibbering round a\r\nstage with a lot of black men. His act was good of its\r\nkind--three trombones, three saxaphones, and Carlyle\'s flute--and\r\nit was his own peculiar sense of rhythm that made all the\r\ndifference; but he began to grow strangely sensitive about it,\r\nbegan to hate the thought of appearing, dreaded it from day to\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThey were making money--each contract he signed called for\r\nmore--but when he went to managers and told them that he wanted\r\nto separate from his sextet and go on as a regular pianist, they\r\nlaughed at him and told him he was crazy--it would be an artistic\r\nsuicide. He used to laugh afterward at the phrase "artistic\r\nsuicide." They all used it.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen times they played at private dances at three\r\nthousand dollars a night, and it seemed as if these crystallized\r\nall his distaste for his mode of livlihood.  They took place in\r\nclubs and houses that he couldn\'t have gone into in the daytime.\r\nAfter all, he was merely playing to r\xf4le of the eternal monkey, a\r\nsort of sublimated chorus man. He was sick of the very smell of\r\nthe theatre, of powder and rouge and the chatter of the\r\ngreenroom, and the patronizing approval of the boxes. He couldn\'t\r\nput his heart into it any more. The idea of a slow approach to\r\nthe luxury of leisure drove him wild. He was, of course,\r\nprogressing toward it, but, like a child, eating his ice-cream so\r\nslowly that he couldn\'t taste it at all.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to have a lot of money and time and opportunity to read\r\nand play, and the sort of men and women round him that he could\r\nnever have--the kind who, if they thought of him at all, would\r\nhave considered him rather contemptible; in short he wanted all\r\nthose things which he was beginning to lump under the general\r\nhead of aristocracy, an aristocracy which it seemed almost any\r\nmoney could buy except money made as he was making it.  He was\r\ntwenty-five then, without family or education or any promise that\r\nhe would succeed in a business career.  He began speculating\r\nwildly, and within three weeks he had lost every cent he had\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThen the war came.  He went to Plattsburg, and even there his\r\nprofession followed him. A brigadier-general called him up to\r\nheadquarters and told him he could serve his country better as a\r\nband leader--so he spent the war entertaining celebrities behind\r\nthe line with a headquarters band.  It was not so bad--except\r\nthat when the infantry came limping back from the trenches he\r\nwanted to be one of them.  The sweat and mud they wore seemed\r\nonly one of those ineffable symbols of aristocracy that were\r\nforever eluding him.\r\n\r\n"It was the private dances that did it.  After I came back from\r\nthe war the old routine started.  We had an offer from a\r\nsyndicate of Florida hotels.  It was only a question of time\r\nthen."\r\n\r\nHe broke off and Ardita looked at him expectantly, but he shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "I\'m going to tell you about it.  I\'m enjoying it\r\ntoo much, and I\'m afraid I\'d lose a little of that enjoyment if I\r\nshared it with anyone else.  I want to hang on to those few\r\nbreathless, heroic moments when I stood out before them all and\r\nlet them know I was more than a damn bobbing, squawking clown."\r\n\r\nFrom up forward came suddenly the low sound of singing. The\r\nnegroes had gathered together on the deck and their voices rose\r\ntogether in a haunting melody that soared in poignant harmonics\r\ntoward the moon. And Ardita listens in enchantment.\r\n\r\n    "Oh down---\r\n          oh down,\r\n     Mammy wanna take me down milky way,\r\n     Oh down,\r\n          oh down,\r\n     Pappy say to-morra-a-a-ah\r\n     But mammy say to-day,\r\n     Yes--mammy say to-day!"\r\n\r\nCarlyle sighed and was silent for a moment looking up at the\r\ngathered host of stars blinking like arc-lights in the warm sky.\r\nThe negroes\' song had died away to a plaintive humming and it\r\nseemed as if minute by minute the brightness and the great\r\nsilence were increasing until he could almost hear the midnight\r\ntoilet of the mermaids as they combed their silver dripping curls\r\nunder the moon and gossiped to each other of the fine wrecks\r\nthey lived on the green opalescent avenues below.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Carlyle softly, "this is the beauty I want.\r\nBeauty has got to be astonishing, astounding--it\'s got to burst\r\nin on you like a dream, like the exquisite eyes of a girl."\r\n\r\nHe turned to her, but she was silent.\r\n\r\n"You see, don\'t you, Anita--I mean, Ardita?"\r\n\r\nAgain she made no answer.  She had been sound asleep for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dense sun-flooded noon of next day a spot in the sea\r\nbefore them resolved casually into a green-and-gray islet,\r\napparently composed of a great granite cliff at its northern end\r\nwhich slanted south through a mile of vivid coppice and grass to\r\na sandy beach melting lazily into the surf.  When Ardita, reading\r\nin her favorite seat, came to the last page of The Revolt of the\r\nAngels, and slamming the book shut looked up and saw it, she\r\ngave a little cry of delight, and called to Carlyle, who was\r\nstanding moodily by the rail.\r\n\r\n"Is this it?  Is this where you\'re going?"\r\n\r\nCarlyle shrugged his shoulders carelessly.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got me."  He raised his voice and called up to the acting\r\nskipper: "Oh, Babe, is this your island?"\r\n\r\nThe mulatto\'s miniature head appeared from round the corner of\r\nthe deck-house.\r\n\r\n"Yas-suh!  This yeah\'s it."\r\n\r\nCarlyle joined Ardita.\r\n\r\n"Looks sort of sporting, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she agreed; "but it doesn\'t look big enough to be much of\r\na hiding-place."\r\n\r\n"You still putting your faith in those wirelesses your uncle was\r\ngoing to have zigzagging round?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Ardita frankly.  "I\'m all for you.  I\'d really like to\r\nsee you make a get-away."\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\n"You\'re our Lady Luck.  Guess we\'ll have to keep you with us as a\r\nmascot--for the present anyway."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t very well ask me to swim back," she said coolly.\r\n"If you do I\'m going to start writing dime novels founded on that\r\ninterminable history of your life you gave me last night."\r\n\r\nHe flushed and stiffened slightly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry I bored you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you didn\'t--until just at the end with some story about how\r\nfurious you were because you couldn\'t dance with the ladies you\r\nplayed music for."\r\n\r\nHe rose angrily.\r\n\r\n"You have got a darn mean little tongue."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," she said melting into laughter, "but I\'m not used to\r\nhaving men regale me with the story of their life\r\nambitions--especially if they\'ve lived such deathly platonic\r\nlives."\r\n\r\n"Why? What do men usually regale you with?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they talk about me," she yawned. "They tell me I\'m the\r\nspirit of youth and beauty."\r\n\r\n"What do you tell them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I agree quietly."\r\n\r\n"Does every man you meet tell you he loves you?"\r\n\r\nArdita nodded.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t he? All life is just a progression toward, and\r\nthen a recession from, one phrase--\'I love you.\'"\r\n\r\nCarlyle laughed and sat down.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very true. That\'s--that\'s not bad. Did you make that up?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--or rather I found it out. It doesn\'t mean anything\r\nespecially. It\'s just clever."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the sort of remark," he said gravely, "that\'s typical of\r\nyour class."\r\n\r\n"Oh," she interrupted impatiently, "don\'t start that lecture on\r\naristocracy again! I distrust people who can be intense at this\r\nhour in the morning. It\'s a mild form of insanity--a sort of\r\nbreakfast-food jag. Morning\'s the time to sleep, swim, and be\r\ncareless."\r\n\r\nTen minutes later they had swung round in a wide circle as if to\r\napproach the island from the north.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a trick somewhere," commented Ardita thoughtfully. "He\r\ncan\'t mean just to anchor up against this cliff."\r\n\r\nThey were heading straight in now toward the solid rock, which\r\nmust have been well over a hundred feet tall, and not until they\r\nwere within fifty yards of it did Ardita see their objective.\r\nThen she clapped her hands in delight. There was a break in the\r\ncliff entirely hidden by a curious overlapping of rock, and\r\nthrough this break the yacht entered and very slowly traversed a\r\nnarrow channel of crystal-clear water between high gray walls.\r\nThen they were riding at anchor in a miniature world of green and\r\ngold, a gilded bay smooth as glass and set round with tiny\r\npalms, the whole resembling the mirror lakes and twig trees that\r\nchildren set up in sand piles.\r\n\r\n"Not so darned bad!" cried Carlyle excitedly.\r\n\r\n"I guess that little coon knows his way round this corner of the\r\nAtlantic."\r\n\r\nHis exuberance was contagious, and Ardita became quite jubilant.\r\n\r\n"It\'s an absolutely sure-fire hiding-place!"\r\n\r\n"Lordy, yes! It\'s the sort of island you read about."\r\n\r\nThe rowboat was lowered into the golden lake and they pulled to\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n"Come on," said Carlyle as they landed in the slushy sand, "we\'ll\r\ngo exploring."\r\n\r\nThe fringe of palms was in turn ringed in by a round mile of\r\nflat, sandy country. They followed it south and brushing through\r\na farther rim of tropical vegetation came out on a pearl-gray\r\nvirgin beach where Ardita kicked of her brown golf shoes--she\r\nseemed to have permanently abandoned stockings--and went wading.\r\nThen they sauntered back to the yacht, where the indefatigable\r\nBabe had luncheon ready for them. He had posted a lookout on the\r\nhigh cliff to the north to watch the sea on both sides, though he\r\ndoubted if the entrance to the cliff was generally known--he had\r\nnever even seen a map on which the island was marked.\r\n\r\n"What\'s its name," asked Ardita--"the island, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"No name \'tall," chuckled Babe. "Reckin she jus\' island, \'at\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon they sat with their backs against great\r\nboulders on the highest part of the cliff and Carlyle sketched\r\nfor her his vague plans. He was sure they were hot after him by\r\nthis time. The total proceeds of the coup he had pulled off and\r\nconcerning which he still refused to enlighten her, he estimated\r\nas just under a million dollars. He counted on lying up here\r\nseveral weeks and then setting off southward, keeping well\r\noutside the usual channels of travel rounding the Horn and\r\nheading for Callao, in Peru. The details of coaling and\r\nprovisioning he was leaving entirely to Babe who, it seemed, had\r\nsailed these seas in every capacity from cabin-boy aboard a\r\ncoffee trader to virtual first mate on a Brazillian pirate craft,\r\nwhose skipper had long since been hung.\r\n\r\n"If he\'d been white he\'d have been king of South America long\r\nago," said Carlyle emphatically. "When it comes to intelligence\r\nhe makes Booker T. Washington look like a moron. He\'s got the\r\nguile of every race and nationality whose blood is in his veins,\r\nand that\'s half a dozen or I\'m a liar. He worships me because I\'m\r\nthe only man in the world who can play better ragtime than he\r\ncan. We used to sit together on the wharfs down on the New York\r\nwater-front, he with a bassoon and me with an oboe, and we\'d\r\nblend minor keys in African harmonics a thousand years old until\r\nthe rats would crawl up the posts and sit round groaning and\r\nsqueaking like dogs will in front of a phonograph."\r\n\r\nArdita roared.\r\n\r\n"How you can tell \'em!"\r\n\r\nCarlyle grinned.\r\n\r\n"I swear that\'s the gos---"\r\n\r\n"What you going to do when you get to Callao?" she interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Take ship for India. I want to be a rajah. I mean it. My idea is\r\nto go up into Afghanistan somewhere, buy up a palace and a\r\nreputation, and then after about five years appear in England\r\nwith a foreign accent and a mysterious past. But India first. Do\r\nyou know, they say that all the gold in the world drifts very\r\ngradually back to India. Something fascinating about that to me.\r\nAnd I want leisure to read--an immense amount."\r\n\r\n"How about after that?"\r\n\r\n"Then," he answered defiantly, "comes aristocracy. Laugh if you\r\nwant to--but at least you\'ll have to admit that I know what I\r\nwant--which I imagine is more than you do."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," contradicted Ardita, reaching in her pocket\r\nfor her cigarette case, "when I met you I was in the midst of a\r\ngreat uproar of all my friends and relatives because I did know\r\nwhat I wanted."\r\n\r\n"What was it?"\r\n\r\n"A man."\r\n\r\nHe started.\r\n\r\n"You mean you were engaged?"\r\n\r\n"After a fashion. If you hadn\'t come aboard I had every intention\r\nof slipping ashore yesterday evening--how long ago it seems--and\r\nmeeting him in Palm Beach. He\'s waiting there for me with a\r\nbracelet that once belonged to Catherine of Russia. Now don\'t\r\nmutter anything about aristocracy," she put in quickly. "I liked\r\nhim simply because he had had an imagination and the utter\r\ncourage of his convictions."\r\n\r\n"But your family disapproved, eh?"\r\n\r\n"What there is of it--only a silly uncle and a sillier aunt. It\r\nseems he got into some scandal with a red-haired woman name Mimi\r\nsomething--it was frightfully exaggerated, he said, and men don\'t\r\nlie to me--and anyway I didn\'t care what he\'d done; it was the\r\nfuture that counted. And I\'d see to that. When a man\'s in love\r\nwith me he doesn\'t care for other amusements. I told him to drop\r\nher like a hot cake, and he did."\r\n\r\n"I feel rather jealous," said Carlyle, frowning--and then he\r\nlaughed. "I guess I\'ll just keep you along with us until we get\r\nto Callao. Then I\'ll lend you enough money to get back to the\r\nStates. By that time you\'ll have had a chance to think that\r\ngentleman over a little more."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk to me like that!" fired up Ardita. "I won\'t tolerate\r\nthe parental attitude from anybody! Do you understand me?" He\r\nchuckled and then stopped, rather abashed, as her cold anger\r\nseemed to fold him about and chill him.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," he offered uncertainly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t apologize! I can\'t stand men who say \'I\'m sorry\' in\r\nthat manly, reserved tone. Just shut up!"\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, a pause which Carlyle found rather awkward, but\r\nwhich Ardita seemed not to notice at all as she sat contentedly\r\nenjoying her cigarette and gazing out at the shining sea. After a\r\nminute she crawled out on the rock and lay with her face over\r\nthe edge looking down. Carlyle, watching her, reflected how it\r\nseemed impossible for her to assume an ungraceful attitude.\r\n\r\n"Oh, look," she cried. "There\'s a lot of sort of ledges down\r\nthere. Wide ones of all different heights."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go swimming to-night!" she said excitedly. "By moonlight."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you rather go in at the beach on the other end?"\r\n\r\n"Not a chance. I like to dive. You can use my uncle\'s bathing\r\nsuit, only it\'ll fit you like a gunny sack, because he\'s a very\r\nflabby man. I\'ve got a one-piece that\'s shocked the natives all\r\nalong the Atlantic coast from Biddeford Pool to St. Augustine."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re a shark."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m pretty good. And I look cute too. A sculptor up at Rye\r\nlast summer told me my calves are worth five hundred dollars."\r\n\r\nThere didn\'t seem to be any answer to this, so Carlyle was\r\nsilent, permitting himself only a discreet interior smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the night crept down in shadowy blue and silver they\r\nthreaded the shimmering channel in the rowboat and, tying it to a\r\njutting rock, began climbing the cliff together. The first shelf\r\nwas ten feet up, wide, and furnishing a natural diving platform.\r\nThere they sat down in the bright moonlight and watched the\r\nfaint incessant surge of the waters almost stilled now as the\r\ntide set seaward.\r\n\r\n"Are you happy?" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Always happy near the sea. You know," she went on, "I\'ve been\r\nthinking all day that you and I are somewhat alike. We\'re both\r\nrebels--only for different reasons. Two years ago, when I was\r\njust eighteen and you were---"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-five."\r\n\r\n"---well, we were both conventional successes. I was an utterly\r\ndevastating d\xe9butante and you were a prosperous musician just\r\ncommissioned in the army---"\r\n\r\n"Gentleman by act of Congress," he put in ironically.\r\n\r\n"Well, at any rate, we both fitted. If our corners were not\r\nrubbed off they were at least pulled in.  But deep in us both was\r\nsomething that made us require more for happiness. I didn\'t know\r\nwhat I wanted. I went from man to man, restless, impatient,\r\nmonth by month getting less acquiescent and more dissatisfied. I\r\nused to sit sometimes chewing at the insides of my mouth and\r\nthinking I was going crazy--I had a frightful sense of\r\ntransiency. I wanted things now--now--now! Here I\r\nwas--beautiful--I am, aren\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Carlyle tentatively.\r\n\r\nArdita rose suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Wait a second. I want to try this delightful-looking sea."\r\n\r\nShe walked to the end of the ledge and shot out over the sea,\r\ndoubling up in mid-air and then straightening out and entering to\r\nwater straight as a blade in a perfect jack-knife dive.\r\n\r\nIn a minute her voice floated up to him.\r\n\r\n"You see, I used to read all day and most of the night. I began\r\nto resent society---"\r\n\r\n"Come on up here," he interrupted. "What on earth are you doing?"\r\n\r\n"Just floating round on my back. I\'ll be up in a minute. Let me\r\ntell you. The only thing I enjoyed was shocking people; wearing\r\nsomething quite impossible and quite charming to a fancy-dress\r\nparty, going round with the fastest men in New York, and getting\r\ninto some of the most hellish scrapes imaginable."\r\n\r\nThe sounds of splashing mingled with her words, and then he heard\r\nher hurried breathing as she began climbing up side to the\r\nledge.\r\n\r\n"Go on in!" she called\r\n\r\nObediently he rose and dived.  When he emerged, dripping, and\r\nmade the climb he found that she was no longer on the ledge, but\r\nafter a second frightened he heard her light laughter from another shelf\r\nten feet up. There he joined her and they both sat quietly for a\r\nmoment, their arms clasped round their knees, panting a little\r\nfrom the climb.\r\n\r\n"The family were wild," she said suddenly. "They tried to marry\r\nme off. And then when I\'d begun to feel that after all life was\r\nscarcely worth living I found something"--her eyes went skyward\r\nexultantly---"I found something!"\r\n\r\nCarlyle waited and her words came with a rush.\r\n\r\n"Courage--just that; courage as a rule of life, and something to\r\ncling to always. I began to build up this enormous faith in\r\nmyself. I began to see that in all my idols in the past some\r\nmanifestation of courage had unconsciously been the thing that\r\nattracted me. I began separating courage from the other things of\r\nlife. All sorts of courage--the beaten, bloody prize-fighter\r\ncoming up for more--I used to make men take me to prize-fights;\r\nthe d\xe9class\xe9 woman sailing through a nest of cats and looking at\r\nthem as if they were mud under her feet; the liking what you like\r\nalways; the utter disregard for other people\'s opinions--just to\r\nlive as I liked always and to die in my own way-- Did you bring\r\nup the cigarettes?"\r\n\r\nHe handed one over and held a match for her gently.\r\n\r\n"Still," Ardita continued, "the men kept gathering--old men and\r\nyoung men, my mental and physical inferiors, most of them, but\r\nall intensely desiring  to have me--to own this rather\r\nmagnificent proud tradition I\'d built up round me. Do you see?"\r\n\r\n"Sort of. You never were beaten and you never apologized."\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\nShe sprang to the edge, poised for a moment like a crucified\r\nfigure against the sky; then describing a dark parabola plunked\r\nwithout a slash between two silver ripples twenty feet below.\r\n\r\nHer voice floated up to him again.\r\n\r\n"And courage to me meant ploughing through that dull gray mist\r\nthat comes down on life--not only overriding people and\r\ncircumstances but overriding the bleakness of living. A sort of\r\ninsistence on the value of life and the worth of transient\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nShe was climbing up now, and at her last words her head, with the\r\ndamp yellow hair slicked symmetrically back appeared on his\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n"All very well," objected Carlyle. "You can call it courage, but\r\nyour courage is really built, after all, on a pride of birth. You\r\nwere bred to that defiant attitude. On my gray days even courage\r\nis one of the things that\'s gray and lifeless."\r\n\r\nShe was sitting near the edge, hugging her knees and gazing\r\nabstractedly at the white moon; he was farther back, crammed like\r\na grotesque god into a niche in the rock.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to sound like Pollyanna," she began, "but you\r\nhaven\'t grasped me yet. My courage is faith--faith in the eternal\r\nresilience of me--that joy\'ll come back, and hope and\r\nspontaneity. And I feel that till it does I\'ve got to keep my\r\nlips shut and my chin high, and my eyes wide--not necessarily any\r\nsilly smiling. Oh, I\'ve been through hell without a whine quite\r\noften--and the female hell is deadlier than the male."\r\n\r\n"But supposing," suggested Carlyle, "that before joy and hope and\r\nall that came back the curtain was drawn on you for good?"\r\n\r\nArdita rose, and going to the wall climbed with some difficulty\r\nto the next ledge, another ten or fifteen feet above.\r\n\r\n"Why," she called back "then I\'d have won!"\r\n\r\nHe edged out till he could see her.\r\n\r\n"Better not dive from there! You\'ll break your back," he said\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n"Not I!"\r\n\r\nSlowly she spread her arms and stood there swan-like, radiating a\r\npride in her young perfection that lit a warm glow in Carlyle\'s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going through the black air with our arms wide and our\r\nfeet straight out behind like a dolphin\'s tail, and we\'re going\r\nto think we\'ll never hit the silver down there till suddenly\r\nit\'ll be all warm round us and full of little kissing, caressing\r\nwaves."\r\n\r\nThen she was in the air, and Carlyle involuntarily held his\r\nbreath. He had not realized that the dive was nearly forty feet.\r\nIt seemed an eternity before he heard the swift compact sound as\r\nshe reached the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd it was with his glad sigh of relief when her light watery\r\nlaughter curled up the side of the cliff and into his anxious\r\nears that he knew he loved her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nTime, having no axe to grind, showered down upon them three days\r\nof afternoons.  When the sun cleared the port-hole of Ardita\'s\r\ncabin an hour after dawn she rose cheerily, donned her\r\nbathing-suit, and went up on deck.  The negroes would leave their\r\nwork when they saw her, and crowd, chuckling and chattering, to\r\nthe rail as she floated, an agile minnow, on and under the\r\nsurface of the clear water.  Again in the cool of the afternoon\r\nshe would swim--and loll and smoke with Carlyle upon the cliff;\r\nor else they would lie on their sides in the sands of the\r\nsouthern beach, talking little, but watching the day fade\r\ncolorfully and tragically into the infinite langour of a tropical\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAnd with the long, sunny hours Ardita\'s idea of the episode as\r\nincidental, madcap, a sprig of romance in a desert of reality,\r\ngradually left her.  She dreaded the time when he would strike\r\noff southward; she dreaded all the eventualities that presented\r\nthemselves to her; thoughts were suddenly troublesome and\r\ndecisions odious.  Had prayers found place in the pagan rituals\r\nof her soul she would have asked of life only to be unmolested\r\nfor a while, lazily acquiescent to the ready, na\xeff flow of\r\nCarlyle\'s ideas, his vivid boyish imagination, and the vein of\r\nmonomania that seemed to run crosswise through his temperament\r\nand colored his every action.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a story of two on an island, nor concerned\r\nprimarily with love bred of isolation. It is merely the\r\npresentation of two personalities, and its idyllic setting among\r\nthe palms of the Gulf Stream is quite incidental. Most of us are\r\ncontent to exist and breed and fight for the right to do both,\r\nand the dominant idea, the foredoomed attest to control one\'s\r\ndestiny, is reserved for the fortunate or unfortunate few. To me\r\nthe interesting thing about Ardita is the courage that will\r\ntarnish with her beauty and youth.\r\n\r\n"Take me with you," she said late one night as they sat lazily in\r\nthe grass under the shadowy spreading palms. The negroes had\r\nbrought ashore their musical instruments, and the sound of weird\r\nragtime was drifting softly over on the warm breath of the night.\r\n"I\'d love to reappear in ten years, as a fabulously wealthy\r\nhigh-caste Indian lady," she continued.\r\n\r\nCarlyle looked at her quickly.\r\n\r\n"You can, you know."\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n"Is it a proposal of marriage? Extra!  Ardita Farnam becomes\r\npirate\'s bride. Society girl kidnapped by ragtime bank robber."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t a bank."\r\n\r\n"What was it? Why won\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to break down your illusions."\r\n\r\n"My dear man, I have no illusions about you."\r\n\r\n"I mean your illusions about yourself."\r\n\r\nShe looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n"About myself! What on earth have I got to do with whatever stray\r\nfelonies you\'ve committed?"\r\n\r\n"That remains to be seen."\r\n\r\nShe reached over and patted his hand.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr. Curtis Carlyle," she said softly, "are you in love with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"As if it mattered."\r\n\r\n"But it does--because I think I\'m in love with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her ironically.\r\n\r\n"Thus swelling your January total to half a dozen," he suggested.\r\n"Suppose I call your bluff and ask you to come to India with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Shall I?"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"We can get married in Callao."\r\n\r\n"What sort of life can you offer me? I don\'t mean that unkindly,\r\nbut seriously; what would become of me if the people who want\r\nthat twenty-thousand-dollar reward ever catch up with you?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you weren\'t afraid."\r\n\r\n"I never am--but I won\'t throw my life away just to show one man\r\nI\'m not."\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d been poor. Just a little poor girl dreaming over a\r\nfence in a warm cow country."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it have been nice?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d have enjoyed astonishing you--watching your eyes open on\r\nthings. If you only wanted things! Don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"I know--like girls who stare into the windows of\r\njewelry-stores."\r\n\r\n"Yes--and want the big oblong watch that\'s platinum and has\r\ndiamonds all round the edge. Only you\'d decide it was too\r\nexpensive and choose one of white gold for a hundred dollar. Then\r\nI\'d say: \'Expensive? I should say not!\' And we\'d go into the\r\nstore and pretty soon the platinum one would be gleaming on your\r\nwrist."\r\n\r\n"That sounds so nice and vulgar--and fun, doesn\'t it?" murmured\r\nArdita.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t it? Can\'t you see us travelling round and spending money\r\nright and left, and being worshipped by bell-boys and waiters?\r\nOh, blessed are the simple rich for they inherit the earth!"\r\n\r\n"I honestly wish we were that way."\r\n\r\n"I love you, Ardita," he said gently.\r\n\r\nHer face lost its childish look for moment and became oddly\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n"I love to be with you," she said, "more than with any man I\'ve\r\never met. And I like your looks and your dark old hair, and the\r\nway you go over the side of the rail when we come ashore. In\r\nfact, Curtis Carlyle, I like all the things you do when you\'re\r\nperfectly natural. I think you\'ve got nerve and you know how I\r\nfeel about that. Sometimes when you\'re around I\'ve been tempted\r\nto kiss you suddenly and tell you that you were just an\r\nidealistic boy with a lot of caste nonsense in his head.\r\nPerhaps if I were just a little bit older and a little more bored\r\nI\'d go with you. As it is, I think I\'ll go back and marry--that\r\nother man."\r\n\r\nOver across the silver lake the figures of the negroes writhed\r\nand squirmed in the moonlight like acrobats who, having been too\r\nlong inactive, must go through their tacks from sheer surplus\r\nenergy. In single file they marched, weaving in concentric\r\ncircles, now with their heads thrown back, now bent over their\r\ninstruments like piping fauns. And from trombone and saxaphone\r\nceaselessly whined a blended melody, sometimes riotous and\r\njubilant, sometimes haunting and plaintive as a death-dance from\r\nthe Congo\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s dance," cried Ardita. "I can\'t sit still with that perfect\r\njazz going on."\r\n\r\nTaking her hand he led her out into a broad stretch of hard sandy\r\nsoil that the moon flooded with great splendor. They floated out\r\nlike drifting moths under the rich hazy light, and as the\r\nfantastic symphony wept and exulted and wavered and despaired\r\nArdita\'s last sense of reality dropped away, and she abandoned\r\nher imagination to the dreamy summer scents of tropical flowers\r\nand the infinite starry spaces overhead, feeling that if she\r\nopened her eyes it would be to find herself dancing with a ghost\r\nin a land created by her own fancy.\r\n\r\n"This is what I should call an exclusive private dance," he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n"I feel quite mad--but delightfully mad!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re enchanted.  The shades of unnumbered generations of\r\ncannibals are watching us from high up on the side of the cliff\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll bet the cannibal women are saying that we dance too\r\nclose, and that it was immodest of me to come without my\r\nnose-ring."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed softly--and then their laughter died as over\r\nacross the lake they heard the trombones stop in the middle of a\r\nbar, and the saxaphones give a startled moan and fade out.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" called Carlyle.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s silence they made out the dark figure of a man\r\nrounding the silver lake at a run. As he came closer they saw it\r\nwas Babe in a state of unusual excitement. He drew up before them\r\nand gasped out his news in a breath.\r\n\r\n"Ship stan\'in\' off sho\' \'bout half a mile suh. Mose, he uz on\r\nwatch, he say look\'s if she\'s done ancho\'d."\r\n\r\n"A ship--what kind of a ship?" demanded Carlyle\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\nDismay was in his voice, and Ardita\'s heart gave a sudden wrench\r\nas she saw his whole face suddenly droop.\r\n\r\n"He say he don\'t know, suh."\r\n\r\n"Are they landing a boat?"\r\n\r\n"No, suh."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go up," said Carlyle.\r\n\r\nThey ascended the hill in silence, Ardita\'s hand still resting in\r\nCarlyle\'s as it had when they finished dancing. She felt it\r\nclinch nervously from time to time as though he were unaware of\r\nthe contact, but though he hurt her she made no attempt to remove\r\nit. It seemed an hour\'s climb before they reached the top and\r\ncrept cautiously across the silhouetted plateau to the edge of\r\nthe cliff. After one short look Carlyle involuntarily gave a\r\nlittle cry. It was a revenue boat with six-inch guns mounted fore\r\nand aft.\r\n\r\n"They know!" he said with a short intake of breath. "They know!\r\nThey picked up the trail somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure they know about the channel? They may be only\r\nstanding by to take a look at the island in the morning. From\r\nwhere they are they couldn\'t see the opening in the cliff."\r\n\r\n"They could with field-glasses," he said hopelessly. He looked at\r\nhis wrist-watch. "It\'s nearly two now. They won\'t do anything\r\nuntil dawn, that\'s certain. Of course there\'s always the faint\r\npossibility that they\'re waiting for some other ship to join; or\r\nfor a coaler."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we may as well stay right here."\r\n\r\nThe hour passed and they lay there side by side, very silently,\r\ntheir chins in their hands like dreaming children. In back of\r\nthem squatted the negroes, patient, resigned, acquiescent,\r\nannouncing now and then with sonorous snores that not even the\r\npresence of danger could subdue their unconquerable African\r\ncraving for sleep.\r\n\r\nJust before five o\'clock Babe approached Carlyle. There were half\r\na dozen rifles aboard the Narcissus he said. Had it been decided\r\nto offer no resistance?\r\n\r\nA pretty good fight might be made, he thought, if they worked out\r\nsome plan.\r\n\r\nCarlyle laughed and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t a Spic army out there, Babe. That\'s a revenue boat.\r\nIt\'d be like a bow and arrow trying to fight a machine-gun. If\r\nyou want to bury those bags somewhere and take a chance on\r\nrecovering them later, go on and do it. But it won\'t work--they\'d\r\ndig this island over from one end to the other. It\'s a lost\r\nbattle all round, Babe."\r\n\r\nBabe inclined his head silently and turned away, and Carlyle\'s\r\nvoice was husky as he turned to Ardita.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the best friend I ever had. He\'d die for me, and be\r\nproud to, if I\'d let him."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve given up?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no choice. Of course there\'s always one way out--the sure\r\nway--but that can wait. I wouldn\'t miss my trial for\r\nanything--it\'ll be an interesting experiment in notoriety.  \'Miss\r\nFarnam testifies that the pirate\'s attitude to her was at all\r\ntimes that of a gentleman.\'"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!" she said. "I\'m awfully sorry."\r\n\r\nWhen the color faded from the sky and lustreless blue changed to\r\nleaden gray a commotion was visible on the ship\'s deck, and they\r\nmade out a group of officers clad in white duck, gathered near\r\nthe rail. They had field-glasses in their hands and were\r\nattentively examining the islet.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all up," said Carlyle grimly.\r\n\r\n"Damn," whispered Ardita. She felt tears gathering in her eyes\r\n"We\'ll go back to the yacht," he said. "I prefer that to being\r\nhunted out up here like a \'possum."\r\n\r\nLeaving the plateau they descended the hill, and reaching the\r\nlake were rowed out to the yacht by the silent negroes. Then,\r\npale and weary, they sank into the settees and waited.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later in the dim gray light the nose of the revenue\r\nboat appeared in the channel and stopped, evidently fearing that\r\nthe bay might be too shallow. From the peaceful look of the\r\nyacht, the man and the girl in the settees, and the negroes\r\nlounging curiously against the rail, they evidently judged that\r\nthere would be no resistance, for two boats were lowered casually\r\nover the side, one containing an officer and six bluejackets,\r\nand the other, four rowers and in the stern two gray-haired men\r\nin yachting flannels. Ardita and Carlyle stood up, and half\r\nunconsciously started toward each other.\r\n\r\nThen he paused and putting his hand suddenly into his pocket he\r\npulled out a round, glittering object and held it out to her.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she asked wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not positive, but I think from the Russian inscription\r\ninside that it\'s your promised bracelet."\r\n\r\n"Where--where on earth---"\r\n\r\n"It came out of one of those bags. You see, Curtis Carlyle and\r\nhis Six Black Buddies, in the middle of their performance in the\r\ntea-room of the hotel at Palm Beach, suddenly changed their\r\ninstruments for automatics and held up the crowd. I took this\r\nbracelet from a pretty, overrouged woman with red hair."\r\n\r\nArdita frowned and then smiled.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s what you did! You HAVE got nerve!"\r\n\r\nHe bowed.\r\n\r\n"A well-known bourgeois quality," he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then dawn slanted dynamically across the deck and flung the\r\nshadows reeling into gray corners. The dew rose and turned to\r\ngolden mist, thin as a dream, enveloping them until they seemed\r\ngossamer relics of the late night, infinitely transient and\r\nalready fading. For a moment sea and sky were breathless, and\r\ndawn held a pink hand over the young mouth of life--then from out\r\nin the lake came the complaint of a rowboat and the swish of\r\noars.\r\n\r\nSuddenly against the golden furnace low in the east their two\r\ngraceful figures melted into one, and he was kissing her spoiled\r\nyoung mouth.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a sort of glory," he murmured after a second.\r\n\r\nShe smiled up at him.\r\n\r\n"Happy, are you?"\r\n\r\nHer sigh was a benediction--an ecstatic surety that she was youth\r\nand beauty now as much as she would ever know. For another\r\ninstant life was radiant and time a phantom and their strength\r\neternal--then there was a bumping, scraping sound as the rowboat\r\nscraped alongside.\r\n\r\nUp the ladder scrambled the two gray-haired men, the officer and\r\ntwo of the sailors with their hands on their revolvers. Mr.\r\nFarnam folded his arms and stood looking at his niece.\r\n\r\n"So," he said nodding his head slowly.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh her arms unwound from Carlyle\'s neck, and her eyes,\r\ntransfigured and far away, fell upon the boarding party. Her\r\nuncle saw her upper lip slowly swell into that arrogant pout he\r\nknew so well.\r\n\r\n"So," he repeated savagely. "So this is your idea of--of romance.\r\nA runaway affair, with a high-seas pirate."\r\n\r\nArdita glanced at him carelessly.\r\n\r\n"What an old fool you are!" she said quietly.\r\n\r\n"Is that the best you can say for yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No," she said as if considering. "No, there\'s something else.\r\nThere\'s that well-known phrase with which I have ended most of\r\nour conversations for the past few years--\'Shut up!\'"\r\n\r\nAnd with that she turned, included the two old men, the officer,\r\nand the two sailors in a curt glance of contempt, and walked\r\nproudly down the companionway.\r\n\r\nBut had she waited an instant longer she would have heard a sound\r\nfrom her uncle quite unfamiliar in most of their interviews. He\r\ngave vent to a whole-hearted amused chuckle, in which the second\r\nold man joined.\r\n\r\nThe latter turned briskly to Carlyle, who had been regarding this\r\nscene with an air of cryptic amusement.\r\n\r\n"Well Toby," he said genially, "you incurable, hare-brained\r\nromantic chaser of rainbows, did you find that she was the person\r\nyou wanted?"\r\n\r\nCarlyle smiled confidently.\r\n\r\n"Why--naturally," he said "I\'ve been perfectly sure ever since I\r\nfirst heard tell of her wild career. That\'d why I had Babe send\r\nup the rocket last night."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you did," said Colonel Moreland gravely. "We\'ve been\r\nkeeping pretty close to you in case you should have trouble with\r\nthose six strange niggers. And we hoped we\'d find you two in some\r\nsuch compromising position," he sighed. "Well, set a crank to\r\ncatch a crank!"\r\n\r\n"Your father and I sat up all night hoping for the best--or\r\nperhaps it\'s the worst. Lord knows you\'re welcome to her, my boy.\r\nShe\'s run me crazy. Did you give her the Russian bracelet my\r\ndetective got from that Mimi woman?"\r\n\r\nCarlyle nodded.\r\n\r\n"Sh!" he said. "She\'s coming on deck."\r\n\r\nArdita appeared at the head of the companionway and gave a quick\r\ninvoluntary glance at Carlyle\'s wrists. A puzzled look passed\r\nacross her face. Back aft the negroes had begun to sing, and the\r\ncool lake, fresh with dawn, echoed serenely to their low voices.\r\n\r\n"Ardita," said Carlyle unsteadily.\r\n\r\nShe swayed a step toward him.\r\n\r\n"Ardita," he repeated breathlessly, "I\'ve got to tell you\r\nthe--the truth. It was all a plant, Ardita. My name isn\'t\r\nCarlyle. It\'s Moreland, Toby Moreland. The story was invented,\r\nArdita, invented out of thin Florida air."\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, bewildered, amazement, disbelief, and anger\r\nflowing in quick waves across her face. The three men held their\r\nbreaths. Moreland, Senior, took a step toward her; Mr. Farnam\'s\r\nmouth dropped a little open as he waited, panic-stricken, for the\r\nexpected crash.\r\n\r\nBut it did not come. Ardita\'s face became suddenly radiant, and\r\nwith a little laugh she went swiftly to young Moreland and looked\r\nup at him without a trace of wrath in her gray eyes.\r\n\r\n"Will you swear," she said quietly "That it was entirely a\r\nproduct of your own brain?"\r\n\r\n"I swear," said young Moreland eagerly.\r\n\r\nShe drew his head down and kissed him gently.\r\n\r\n"What an imagination!" she said softly and almost enviously. "I\r\nwant you to lie to me just as sweetly as you know how for the\r\nrest of my life."\r\n\r\nThe negroes\' voices floated drowsily back, mingled in an air that\r\nshe had heard them singing before.\r\n\r\n    "Time is a thief;\r\n     Gladness and grief\r\n     Cling to the leaf\r\n         As it yellows---"\r\n\r\n"What was in the bags?" she asked softly.\r\n\r\n"Florida mud," he answered. "That was one of the two true things\r\nI told you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I can guess the other one," she said; and reaching up on\r\nher tiptoes she kissed him softly in the illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ice Palace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sunlight dripped over the house like golden paint over an art\r\njar, and the freckling shadows here and there only intensified\r\nthe rigor of the bath of light. The Butterworth and Larkin houses\r\nflanking were entrenched behind great stodgy trees; only the\r\nHapper house took the full sun, and all day long faced the dusty\r\nroad-street with a tolerant kindly patience. This was the city of\r\nTarleton in southernmost Georgia, September afternoon.\r\n\r\nUp in her bedroom window Sally Carrol Happer rested her\r\nnineteen-year-old chin on a fifty-two-year-old sill and watched\r\nClark Darrow\'s ancient Ford turn the corner. The car was\r\nhot--being partly metallic it retained all the heat it absorbed\r\nor evolved--and Clark Darrow sitting bolt upright at the wheel\r\nwore a pained, strained expression as though he considered\r\nhimself a spare part, and rather likely to break. He laboriously\r\ncrossed two dust ruts, the wheels squeaking indignantly at the\r\nencounter, and then with a terrifying expression he gave the\r\nsteering-gear a final wrench and deposited self and car\r\napproximately in front of the Happer steps. There was a heaving\r\nsound, a death-rattle, followed by a short silence; and then the\r\nair was rent by a startling whistle.\r\n\r\nSally Carrol gazed down sleepily.  She started to yawn, but\r\nfinding this quite impossible unless she raised her chin from the\r\nwindow-sill, changed her mind and continued silently to regard\r\nthe car, whose owner sat brilliantly if perfunctorily at\r\nattention as he waited for an answer to his signal. After a\r\nmoment the whistle once more split the dusty air.\r\n\r\n"Good mawnin\'."\r\n\r\nWith difficulty Clark twisted his tall body round and bent a\r\ndistorted glance on the window.\r\n\r\n"Tain\'t mawnin\', Sally Carrol."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it, sure enough?"\r\n\r\n"What you doin\'?"\r\n\r\n"Eatin\' \'n apple."\r\n\r\n"Come on go swimmin\'--want to?"\r\n\r\n"Reckon so."\r\n\r\n"How \'bout hurryin\' up?"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough."\r\n\r\nSally Carrol sighed voluminously and raised herself with profound\r\ninertia from the floor where she had been occupied in\r\nalternately destroyed parts of a green apple and painting paper\r\ndolls for her younger sister. She approached a mirror, regarded\r\nher expression with a pleased and pleasant languor, dabbed two\r\nspots of rouge on her lips and a grain of powder on her nose, and\r\ncovered her bobbed corn-colored hair with a rose-littered\r\nsunbonnet. Then she kicked over the painting water, said, "Oh,\r\ndamn!"--but let it lay--and left the room.\r\n\r\n"How you, Clark?" she inquired a minute later as she slipped\r\nnimbly over the side of the car.\r\n\r\n"Mighty fine, Sally Carrol."\r\n\r\n"Where we go swimmin\'?"\r\n\r\n"Out to Walley\'s Pool. Told Marylyn we\'d call by an\' get her an\'\r\nJoe Ewing."\r\n\r\nClark was dark and lean, and when on foot was rather inclined to\r\nstoop. His eyes were ominous and his expression somewhat petulant\r\nexcept when startlingly illuminated by one of his frequent\r\nsmiles. Clark had "a income"--just enough to keep himself in ease\r\nand his car in gasolene--and he had spent the two years since he\r\ngraduated from Georgia Tech in dozing round the lazy streets of\r\nhis home town, discussing how he could best invest his capital\r\nfor an immediate fortune.\r\n\r\nHanging round he found not at all difficult; a crowd of little\r\ngirls had grown up beautifully, the amazing Sally Carrol foremost\r\namong them; and they enjoyed being swum with and danced with and\r\nmade love to in the flower-filled summery evenings--and they all\r\nliked Clark immensely. When feminine company palled there were\r\nhalf a dozen other youths who were always just about to do\r\nsomething, and meanwhile were quite willing to join him in a few\r\nholes of golf, or a game of billiards, or the consumption of a\r\nquart of "hard yella licker." Every once in a while one of these\r\ncontemporaries made a farewell round of calls before going up to\r\nNew York or Philadelphia or Pittsburgh to go into business, but\r\nmostly they just stayed round in this languid paradise of dreamy\r\nskies and firefly evenings and noisy nigger street fairs--and\r\nespecially of gracious, soft-voiced girls, who were brought up on\r\nmemories instead of money.\r\n\r\nThe Ford having been excited into a sort of restless resentful\r\nlife Clark and Sally Carrol rolled and rattled down Valley Avenue\r\ninto Jefferson Street, where the dust road became a pavement;\r\nalong opiate Millicent Place, where there were half a dozen\r\nprosperous, substantial mansions; and on into the down-town\r\nsection.  Driving was perilous here, for it was shopping time;\r\nthe population idled casually across the streets and a drove of\r\nlow-moaning oxen were being urged along in front of a placid\r\nstreet-car; even the shops seemed only yawning their doors and\r\nblinking their windows in the sunshine before retiring into a\r\nstate of utter and finite coma.\r\n\r\n"Sally Carrol," said Clark suddenly, "it a fact that you\'re\r\nengaged?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly.\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you hear that?"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough, you engaged?"\r\n\r\n"\'At\'s a nice question!"\r\n\r\n"Girl told me you were engaged to a Yankee you met up in\r\nAsheville last summer."\r\n\r\nSally Carrol sighed.\r\n\r\n"Never saw such an old town for rumors."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t marry a Yankee, Sally Carrol.  We need you round here."\r\n\r\nSally Carrol was silent a moment.\r\n\r\n"Clark," she demanded suddenly, "who on earth shall I marry?"\r\n\r\n"I offer my services."\r\n\r\n"Honey, you couldn\'t support a wife," she answered cheerfully.\r\n"Anyway, I know you too well to fall in love with you."\r\n\r\n"\'At doesn\'t mean you ought to marry a Yankee," he persisted.\r\n\r\n"S\'pose I love him?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t. He\'d be a lot different from us, every way."\r\n\r\nHe broke off as he halted the car in front of a rambling,\r\ndilapidated house. Marylyn Wade and Joe Ewing appeared in the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n"\'Lo Sally Carrol."\r\n\r\n"Hi!"\r\n\r\n"How you-all?"\r\n\r\n"Sally Carrol," demanded Marylyn as they started of again, "you\r\nengaged?"\r\n\r\n"Lawdy, where\'d all this start? Can\'t I look at a man \'thout\r\neverybody in town engagin\' me to him?"\r\n\r\nClark stared straight in front of him at a bolt on the clattering\r\nwind-shield.\r\n\r\n"Sally Carrol," he said with a curious intensity, "don\'t you\r\n\'like us?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Us down here?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Clark, you know I do. I adore all you boys."\r\n\r\n"Then why you gettin\' engaged to a Yankee?"\r\n\r\n"Clark, I don\'t know. I\'m not sure what I\'ll do, but--well, I\r\nwant to go places and see people. I want my mind to grow. I want\r\nto live where things happen on a big scale."\r\n\r\n"What you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Clark, I love you, and I love Joe here and Ben Arrot, and\r\nyou-all, but you\'ll--you\'ll---"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll all be failures?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I don\'t mean only money failures, but just sort of--of\r\nineffectual and sad, and--oh, how can I tell you?"\r\n\r\n"You mean because we stay here in Tarleton?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Clark; and because you like it and never want to change\r\nthings or think or go ahead."\r\n\r\nHe nodded and she reached over and pressed his hand.\r\n\r\n"Clark," she said softly, "I wouldn\'t change you for the world.\r\nYou\'re sweet the way you are. The things that\'ll make you fail\r\nI\'ll love always--the living in the past, the lazy days and\r\nnights you have, and all your carelessness and generosity."\r\n\r\n"But you\'re goin\' away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--because I couldn\'t ever marry you. You\'ve a place in my\r\nheart no one else ever could have, but tied down here I\'d get\r\nrestless. I\'d feel I was--wastin\' myself. There\'s two sides to\r\nme, you see. There\'s the sleepy old side you love an\' there\'s a\r\nsort of energy--the feeling that makes me do wild things. That\'s\r\nthe part of me that may be useful somewhere, that\'ll last when\r\nI\'m not beautiful any more."\r\n\r\nShe broke of with characteristic suddenness and sighed, "Oh,\r\nsweet cooky!" as her mood changed.\r\n\r\nHalf closing her eyes and tipping back her head till it rested on\r\nthe seat-back she let the savory breeze fan her eyes and ripple\r\nthe fluffy curls of her bobbed hair. They were in the country\r\nnow, hurrying between tangled growths of bright-green coppice and\r\ngrass and tall trees that sent sprays of foliage to hang a cool\r\nwelcome over the road. Here and there they passed a battered\r\nnegro cabin, its oldest white-haired inhabitant smoking a corncob\r\npipe beside the door, and half a dozen scantily clothed\r\npickaninnies parading tattered dolls on the wild-grown grass in\r\nfront. Farther out were lazy cotton-fields where even the workers\r\nseemed intangible shadows lent by the sun to the earth, not for\r\ntoil, but to while away some age-old tradition in the golden\r\nSeptember fields. And round the drowsy picturesqueness, over the\r\ntrees and shacks and muddy rivers, flowed the heat, never\r\nhostile, only comforting, like a great warm nourishing bosom for\r\nthe infant earth.\r\n\r\n"Sally Carrol, we\'re here!"\r\n\r\n"Poor chile\'s soun\' asleep."\r\n\r\n"Honey, you dead at last outa sheer laziness?"\r\n\r\n"Water, Sally Carrol! Cool water waitin\' for you!"\r\n\r\nHer eyes opened sleepily.\r\n\r\n"Hi!" she murmured, smiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November Harry Bellamy, tall, broad, and brisk, came down from\r\nhis Northern city to spend four days. His intention was to\r\nsettle a matter that had been hanging fire since he and Sally\r\nCarrol had met in Asheville, North Carolina, in midsummer. The\r\nsettlement took only a quiet afternoon and an evening in front of\r\na glowing open fire, for Harry Bellamy had everything she\r\nwanted; and, beside, she loved him--loved him with that side of\r\nher she kept especially for loving. Sally Carrol had several\r\nrather clearly defined sides.\r\n\r\nOn his last afternoon they walked, and she found their steps\r\ntending half-unconsciously toward one of her favorite haunts, the\r\ncemetery. When it came in sight, gray-white and golden-green\r\nunder the cheerful late sun, she paused, irresolute, by the iron\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n"Are you mournful by nature, Harry?" she asked with a faint\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Mournful? Not I."\r\n\r\n"Then let\'s go in here. It depresses some folks, but I like it."\r\n\r\nThey passed through the gateway and followed a path that led\r\nthrough a wavy valley of graves--dusty-gray and mouldy for the\r\nfifties; quaintly carved with flowers and jars for the seventies;\r\nornate and hideous for the nineties, with fat marble cherubs\r\nlying in sodden sleep on stone pillows, and great impossible\r\ngrowths of nameless granite flowers.\r\n\r\nOccasionally they saw a kneeling figure with tributary flowers,\r\nbut over most of the graves lay silence and withered leaves with\r\nonly the fragrance that their own shadowy memories could waken in\r\nliving minds.\r\n\r\nThey reached the top of a hill where they were fronted by a tall,\r\nround head-stone, freckled with dark spots of damp and half\r\ngrown over with vines.\r\n\r\n"Margery Lee," she read; "1844-1873.  Wasn\'t she nice?  She died\r\nwhen she was twenty-nine.  Dear Margery Lee," she added softly.\r\n"Can\'t you see her, Harry?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sally Carrol."\r\n\r\nHe felt a little hand insert itself into his.\r\n\r\n"She was dark, I think; and she always wore her hair with a\r\nribbon in it, and gorgeous hoop-skirts of Alice blue and old\r\nrose."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she was sweet, Harry!  And she was the sort of girl born to\r\nstand on a wide, pillared porch and welcome folks in.  I think\r\nperhaps a lot of men went away to war meanin\' to come back to\r\nher; but maybe none of \'em ever did."\r\n\r\nHe stooped down close to the stone, hunting for any record of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing here to show."\r\n\r\n"Of course not.  How could there be anything there better than\r\njust \'Margery Lee,\' and that eloquent date?"\r\n\r\nShe drew close to him and an unexpected lump came into his throat\r\nas her yellow hair brushed his cheek.\r\n\r\n"You see how she was, don\'t you Harry?"\r\n\r\n"I see," he agreed gently. "I see through your precious eyes.\r\nYou\'re beautiful now, so I know she must have been."\r\n\r\nSilent and close they stood, and he could feel her shoulders\r\ntrembling a little. An ambling breeze swept up the hill and\r\nstirred the brim of her floppidy hat.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go down there!"\r\n\r\nShe was pointing to a flat stretch on the other side of the hill\r\nwhere along the green turf were a thousand grayish-white crosses\r\nstretching in endless, ordered rows like the stacked arms of a\r\nbattalion.\r\n\r\n"Those are the Confederate dead," said Sally Carrol simply.\r\n\r\nThey walked along and read the inscriptions, always only a name\r\nand a date, sometimes quite indecipherable.\r\n\r\n"The last row is the saddest--see, \'way over there. Every cross\r\nhas just a date on it and the word \'Unknown.\'"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him and her eyes brimmed with tears.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you how real it is to me, darling--if you don\'t\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"How you feel about it is beautiful to me."\r\n\r\n"No, no, it\'s not me, it\'s them--that old time that I\'ve tried to\r\nhave live in me. These were just men, unimportant evidently or\r\nthey wouldn\'t have been \'unknown\'; but they died for the most\r\nbeautiful thing in the world--the dead South. You see," she\r\ncontinued, her voice still husky, her eyes glistening with tears,\r\n"people have these dreams they fasten onto things, and I\'ve\r\nalways grown up with that dream. It was so easy because it was\r\nall dead and there weren\'t any disillusions comin\' to me. I\'ve\r\ntried in a way to live up to those past standards of noblesse\r\noblige--there\'s just the last remnants of it, you know, like the\r\nroses of an old garden dying all round us--streaks of strange\r\ncourtliness and chivalry in some of these boys an\' stories I used\r\nto hear from a Confederate soldier who lived next door, and a\r\nfew old darkies. Oh, Harry, there was something, there was\r\nsomething! I couldn\'t ever make you understand but it was there."\r\n\r\n"I understand," he assured her again quietly.\r\n\r\nSally Carol smiled and dried her eyes on the tip of a\r\nhandkerchief protruding from his breast pocket.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t feel depressed, do you, lover?  Even when I cry I\'m\r\nhappy here, and I get a sort of strength from it."\r\n\r\nHand in hand they turned and walked slowly away. Finding soft\r\ngrass she drew him down to a seat beside her with their backs\r\nagainst the remnants of a low broken wall.\r\n\r\n"Wish those three old women would clear out," he complained. "I\r\nwant to kiss you, Sally Carrol."\r\n\r\n"Me, too."\r\n\r\nThey waited impatiently for the three bent figures to move off,\r\nand then she kissed him until the sky seemed to fade out and all\r\nher smiles and tears to vanish in an ecstasy of eternal seconds.\r\n\r\nAfterward they walked slowly back together, while on the corners\r\ntwilight played at somnolent black-and-white checkers with the\r\nend of day.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be up about mid-January," he said, "and you\'ve got to\r\nstay a month at least. It\'ll be slick. There\'s a winter carnival\r\non, and if you\'ve never really seen snow it\'ll be like fairy-land\r\nto you. There\'ll be skating and skiing and tobogganing and\r\nsleigh-riding, and all sorts of torchlight parades on snow-shoes.\r\nThey haven\'t had one for years, so they\'re gong to make it a\r\nknock-out."\r\n\r\n"Will I be cold, Harry?" she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n"You certainly won\'t. You may freeze your nose, but you won\'t be\r\nshivery cold. It\'s hard and dry, you know."\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'m a summer child. I don\'t like any cold I\'ve ever\r\nseen."\r\n\r\nShe broke off and they were both silent for a minute.\r\n\r\n"Sally Carol," he said very slowly, "what do you say to--March?"\r\n\r\n"I say I love you."\r\n\r\n"March?"\r\n\r\n"March, Harry."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night in the Pullman it was very cold. She rang for the\r\nporter to ask for another blanket, and when he couldn\'t give her\r\none she tried vainly, by squeezing down into the bottom of her\r\nberth and doubling back the bedclothes, to snatch a few hours\'\r\nsleep. She wanted to look her best in the morning.\r\n\r\nShe rose at six and sliding uncomfortably into her clothes\r\nstumbled up to the diner for a cup of coffee. The snow had\r\nfiltered into the vestibules and covered the door with a slippery\r\ncoating. It was intriguing this cold, it crept in everywhere.\r\nHer breath was quite visible and she blew into the air with a\r\nna\xefve enjoyment. Seated in the diner she stared out the window at\r\nwhite hills and valleys and scattered pines whose every branch\r\nwas a green platter for a cold feast of snow. Sometimes a\r\nsolitary farmhouse would fly by, ugly and bleak and lone on the\r\nwhite waste; and with each one she had an instant of chill\r\ncompassion for the souls shut in there waiting for spring.\r\n\r\nAs she left the diner and swayed back into the Pullman she\r\nexperienced a surging rush of energy and wondered if she was\r\nfeeling the bracing air of which Harry had spoken. This was the\r\nNorth, the North--her land now!\r\n\r\n     "Then blow, ye winds, heighho!\r\n      A-roving I will go,"\r\n\r\nshe chanted exultantly to herself.\r\n\r\n"What\'s \'at?" inquired the porter politely.\r\n\r\n"I said: \'Brush me off.\'"\r\n\r\nThe long wires of the telegraph poles doubled, two tracks ran up\r\nbeside the train--three--four; came a succession of white-roofed\r\nhouses, a glimpse of a trolley-car with frosted windows,\r\nstreets--more streets--the city.\r\n\r\nShe stood for a dazed moment in the frosty station before she saw\r\nthree fur-bundled figures descending upon her.\r\n\r\n"There she is!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sally Carrol!"\r\n\r\nSally Carrol dropped her bag.\r\n\r\n"Hi!"\r\n\r\nA faintly familiar icy-cold face kissed her, and then she was in\r\na group of faces all apparently emitting great clouds of heavy\r\nsmoke; she was shaking hands. There were Gordon, a short, eager\r\nman of thirty who looked like an amateur knocked-about model for\r\nHarry, and his wife, Myra, a listless lady with flaxen hair under\r\na fur automobile cap. Almost immediately Sally Carrol thought of\r\nher as vaguely Scandinavian. A cheerful chauffeur adopted her\r\nbag, and amid ricochets of half-phrases, exclamations and\r\nperfunctory listless "my dears" from Myra, they swept each other\r\nfrom the station.\r\n\r\nThen they were in a sedan bound through a crooked succession of\r\nsnowy streets where dozens of little boys were hitching sleds\r\nbehind grocery wagons and automobiles.\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried Sally Carrol, "I want to do that! Can we Harry?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s for kids. But we might---"\r\n\r\n"It looks like such a circus!" she said regretfully.\r\n\r\nHome was a rambling frame house set on a white lap of snow, and\r\nthere she met a big, gray-haired man of whom she approved, and a\r\nlady who was like an egg, and who kissed her--these were Harry\'s\r\nparents. There was a breathless indescribable hour crammed full\r\nof self-sentences, hot water, bacon and eggs and confusion; and\r\nafter that she was alone with Harry in the library, asking him if\r\nshe dared smoke.\r\n\r\nIt was a large room with a Madonna over the fireplace and rows\r\nupon rows of books in covers of light gold and dark gold and\r\nshiny red. All the chairs had little lace squares where one\'s head\r\nshould rest, the couch was just comfortable, the books looked as\r\nif they had been read--some--and Sally Carrol had an\r\ninstantaneous vision of the battered old library at home, with\r\nher father\'s huge medical books, and the oil-paintings of her\r\nthree great-uncles, and the old couch that had been mended up for\r\nforty-five years and was still luxurious to dream in.  This room\r\nstruck her as being neither attractive nor particularly\r\notherwise. It was simply a room with a lot of fairly expensive\r\nthings in it that all looked about fifteen years old.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it up here?" demanded Harry eagerly. "Does\r\nit surprise you? Is it what you expected I mean?"\r\n\r\n"You are, Harry," she said quietly, and reached out her arms to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut after a brief kiss he seemed to extort enthusiasm from her.\r\n\r\n"The town, I mean. Do you like it? Can you feel the pep in the\r\nair?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry," she laughed, "you\'ll have to give me time. You can\'t\r\njust fling questions at me."\r\n\r\nShe puffed at her cigarette with a sigh of contentment.\r\n\r\n"One thing I want to ask you," he began rather apologetically;\r\n"you Southerners put quite an emphasis on family, and all\r\nthat--not that it isn\'t quite all right, but you\'ll find it a\r\nlittle different here. I mean--you\'ll notice a lot of things\r\nthat\'ll seem to you sort of vulgar display at first, Sally\r\nCarrol; but just remember that this is a three-generation town.\r\nEverybody has a father, and about half of us have grandfathers.\r\nBack of that we don\'t go."\r\n\r\n"Of course," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Our grandfathers, you see, founded the place, and a lot of them\r\nhad to take some pretty queer jobs while they were doing the\r\nfounding. For instance there\'s one woman who at present is about\r\nthe social model for the town; well, her father was the first\r\npublic ash man--things like that."\r\n\r\n"Why," said Sally Carol, puzzled, "did you s\'pose I was goin\' to\r\nmake remarks about people?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," interrupted Harry, "and I\'m not apologizing for any\r\none either. It\'s just that--well, a Southern girl came up here\r\nlast summer and said some unfortunate things, and--oh, I just\r\nthought I\'d tell you."\r\n\r\nSally Carrol felt suddenly indignant--as though she had been\r\nunjustly spanked--but Harry evidently considered the subject\r\nclosed, for he went on with a great surge of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"It\'s carnival time, you know. First in ten years. And there\'s an\r\nice palace they\'re building new that\'s the first they\'ve had\r\nsince eighty-five. Built out of blocks of the clearest ice they\r\ncould find--on a tremendous scale."\r\n\r\nShe rose and walking to the window pushed aside the heavy Turkish\r\nporti\xe8res and looked out.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she cried suddenly. "There\'s two little boys makin\' a snow\r\nman! Harry, do you reckon I can go out an\' help \'em?"\r\n\r\n"You dream! Come here and kiss me."\r\n\r\nShe left the window rather reluctantly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t guess this is a very kissable climate, is it? I mean, it\r\nmakes you so you don\'t want to sit round, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re not going to. I\'ve got a vacation for the first week\r\nyou\'re here, and there\'s a dinner-dance to-night."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry," she confessed, subsiding in a heap, half in his lap,\r\nhalf in the pillows, "I sure do feel confused. I haven\'t got an\r\nidea whether I\'ll like it or not, an\' I don\'t know what people\r\nexpect, or anythin\'. You\'ll have to tell me, honey."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you," he said softly, "if you\'ll just tell me you\'re\r\nglad to be here."\r\n\r\n"Glad--just awful glad!" she whispered, insinuating herself into\r\nhis arms in her own peculiar way.  "Where you are is home for me,\r\nHarry."\r\n\r\nAnd as she said this she had the feeling for almost the first\r\ntime in her life that she was acting a part.\r\n\r\nThat night, amid the gleaming candles of a dinner-party, where\r\nthe men seemed to do most of the talking while the girls sat in a\r\nhaughty and expensive aloofness, even Harry\'s presence on her\r\nleft failed to make her feel at home.\r\n\r\n"They\'re a good-looking crowd, don\'t you think?" he demanded.\r\n"Just look round. There\'s Spud Hubbard, tackle at Princeton last\r\nyear, and Junie Morton--he and the red-haired fellow next to him\r\nwere both Yale hockey captains; Junie was in my class. Why, the\r\nbest athletes in the world come from these States round here.\r\nThis is a man\'s country, I tell you. Look at John J. Fishburn!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s he?" asked Sally Carrol innocently.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard the name."\r\n\r\n"Greatest wheat man in the Northwest, and one of the greatest\r\nfinanciers in the country."\r\n\r\nShe turned suddenly to a voice on her right.\r\n\r\n"I guess they forget to introduce us. My name\'s Roger Patton."\r\n\r\n"My name is Sally Carrol Happer," she said graciously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. Harry told me you were coming."\r\n\r\n"You a relative?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m a professor."\r\n\r\n"Oh," she laughed.\r\n\r\n"At the university.  You\'re from the South, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Tarleton, Georgia."\r\n\r\nShe liked him immediately--a reddish-brown mustache under watery\r\nblue eyes that had something in them that these other eyes\r\nlacked, some quality of appreciation. They exchanged stray\r\nsentences through dinner, and she made up her mind to see him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAfter coffee she was introduced to numerous good-looking young\r\nmen who danced with conscious precision and seemed to take it for\r\ngranted that she wanted to talk about nothing except Harry.\r\n\r\n"Heavens," she thought, "They talk as if my being engaged made me\r\nolder than they are--as if I\'d tell their mothers on them!"\r\n\r\nIn the South an engaged girl, even a young married woman,\r\nexpected the same amount of half-affectionate badinage and\r\nflattery that would be accorded a d\xe9butante, but here all that\r\nseemed banned.  One young man after getting well started on the\r\nsubject of Sally Carrol\'s eyes and, how they had allured him ever\r\nsince she entered the room, went into a violent convulsion when\r\nhe found she was visiting the Bellamys--was Harry\'s fianc\xe9e. He\r\nseemed to feel as though he had made some risqu\xe9 and inexcusable\r\nblunder, became immediately formal and left her at the first\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nShe was rather glad when Roger Patton cut in on her and suggested\r\nthat they sit out a while.\r\n\r\n"Well," he inquired, blinking cheerily, "how\'s Carmen from the\r\nSouth?"\r\n\r\n"Mighty fine.  How\'s--how\'s Dangerous Dan McGrew? Sorry, but he\'s\r\nthe only Northerner I know much about."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to enjoy that.\r\n\r\n"Of course," he confessed, "as a professor of literature I\'m not\r\nsupposed to have read Dangerous Dan McGrew."\r\n\r\n"Are you a native?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m a Philadelphian. Imported from Harvard to teach French.\r\nBut I\'ve been here ten years."\r\n\r\n"Nine years, three hundred an\' sixty-four days longer than me."\r\n\r\n"Like it here?"\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh.  Sure do!"\r\n\r\n"Really?"\r\n\r\n"Well, why not? Don\'t I look as if I were havin\' a good time?"\r\n\r\n"I saw you look out the window a minute ago--and shiver."\r\n\r\n"Just my imagination," laughed Sally Carroll "I\'m used to havin\'\r\neverythin\' quiet outside an\' sometimes I look out an\' see a\r\nflurry of snow an\' it\'s just as if somethin\' dead was movin\'."\r\n\r\nHe nodded appreciatively.\r\n\r\n"Ever been North before?"\r\n\r\n"Spent two Julys in Asheville, North Carolina."\r\n\r\n"Nice-looking crowd aren\'t they?" suggested Patton, indicating\r\nthe swirling floor.\r\n\r\nSally Carrol started. This had been Harry\'s remark.\r\n\r\n"Sure are! They\'re--canine."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\nShe flushed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry; that sounded worse than I meant it. You see I always\r\nthink of people as feline or canine, irrespective of sex."\r\n\r\n"Which are you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m feline. So are you. So are most Southern men an\' most of\r\nthese girls here."\r\n\r\n"What\'s Harry?"\r\n\r\n"Harry\'s canine distinctly. All the men I\'ve to-night seem to be\r\ncanine."\r\n\r\n"What does canine imply? A certain conscious masculinity as\r\nopposed to subtlety?"\r\n\r\n"Reckon so. I never analyzed it--only I just look at people an\'\r\nsay \'canine\' or \'feline\' right off. It\'s right absurd I guess."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I\'m interested. I used to have a theory about these\r\npeople. I think they\'re freezing up."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they\'re growing\' like Swedes--Ibsenesque, you know. Very\r\ngradually getting gloomy and melancholy. It\'s these long winters.\r\nEver read Ibsen?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Well, you find in his characters a certain brooding rigidity.\r\nThey\'re righteous, narrow, and cheerless, without infinite\r\npossibilities for great sorrow or joy."\r\n\r\n"Without smiles or tears?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly.  That\'s my theory.  You see there are thousands of\r\nSwedes up here. They come, I imagine, because the climate is very\r\nmuch like their own, and there\'s been a gradual mingling.\r\nThere\'re probably not half a dozen here to-night, but--we\'ve had\r\nfour Swedish governors. Am I boring you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty interested."\r\n\r\n"Your future sister-in-law is half Swedish. Personally I like\r\nher, but my theory is that Swedes react rather badly on us as a\r\nwhole. Scandinavians, you know, have the largest suicide rate in\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"Why do you live here if it\'s so depressing?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it doesn\'t get me. I\'m pretty well cloistered, and I suppose\r\nbooks mean more than people to me anyway."\r\n\r\n"But writers all speak about the South being tragic. You\r\nknow--Spanish se\xf1oritas, black hair and daggers an\' haunting\r\nmusic."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n"No, the Northern races are the tragic races--they don\'t indulge\r\nin the cheering luxury of tears."\r\n\r\nSally Carrol thought of her graveyard. She supposed that that was\r\nvaguely what she had meant when she said it didn\'t depress her.\r\n\r\n"The Italians are about the gayest people in the world--but it\'s\r\na dull subject," he broke off.  "Anyway, I want to tell you\r\nyou\'re marrying a pretty fine man."\r\n\r\nSally Carrol was moved by an impulse of confidence.\r\n\r\n"I know. I\'m the sort of person who wants to be taken care of\r\nafter a certain point, and I feel sure I will be."\r\n\r\n"Shall we dance? You know," he continued as they rose, "it\'s\r\nencouraging to find a girl who knows what she\'s marrying for.\r\nNine-tenths of them think of it as a sort of walking into a\r\nmoving-picture sunset."\r\n\r\nShe laughed and liked him immensely.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later on the way home she nestled near Harry in the\r\nback seat.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry," she whispered "it\'s so co-old!"\r\n\r\n"But it\'s warm in here, daring girl."\r\n\r\n"But outside it\'s cold; and oh, that howling wind!"\r\n\r\nShe buried her face deep in his fur coat and trembled\r\ninvoluntarily as his cold lips kissed the tip of her ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first week of her visit passed in a whirl. She had her\r\npromised toboggan-ride at the back of an automobile through a\r\nchill January twilight. Swathed in furs she put in a morning\r\ntobogganing on the country-club hill; even tried skiing, to sail\r\nthrough the air for a glorious moment and then land in a tangled\r\nlaughing bundle on a soft snow-drift. She liked all the winter\r\nsports, except an afternoon spent snow-shoeing over a glaring\r\nplain under pale yellow sunshine, but she soon realized that\r\nthese things were for children--that she was being humored and\r\nthat the enjoyment round her was only a reflection of her own.\r\n\r\nAt first the Bellamy family puzzled her. The men were reliable\r\nand she liked them; to Mr. Bellamy especially, with his iron-gray\r\nhair and energetic dignity, she took an immediate fancy, once\r\nshe found that he was born in Kentucky; this made of him a link\r\nbetween the old life and the new. But toward the women she felt a\r\ndefinite hostility. Myra, her future sister-in-law, seemed the\r\nessence of spiritless conversationality. Her conversation was so\r\nutterly devoid of personality that Sally Carrol, who came from a\r\ncountry where a certain amount of charm and assurance could be\r\ntaken for granted in the women, was inclined to despise her.\r\n\r\n"If those women aren\'t beautiful," she thought, "they\'re nothing.\r\nThey just fade out when you look at them. They\'re glorified\r\ndomestics. Men are the centre of every mixed group."\r\n\r\nLastly there was Mrs. Bellamy, whom Sally Carrol detested. The\r\nfirst day\'s impression of an egg had been confirmed--an egg with\r\na cracked, veiny voice and such an ungracious dumpiness of\r\ncarriage that Sally Carrol felt that if she once fell she would\r\nsurely scramble. In addition, Mrs. Bellamy seemed to typify the\r\ntown in being innately hostile to strangers. She called Sally\r\nCarrol "Sally," and could not be persuaded that the double name\r\nwas anything more than a tedious ridiculous nickname. To Sally\r\nCarrol this shortening of her name was presenting her to the\r\npublic half clothed. She loved "Sally Carrol"; she loathed\r\n"Sally."  She knew also that Harry\'s mother disapproved of her\r\nbobbed hair; and she had never dared smoke down-stairs after that\r\nfirst day when Mrs. Bellamy had come into the library sniffing\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\nOf all the men she met she preferred Roger Patton, who was a\r\nfrequent visitor at the house.  He never again alluded to the\r\nIbsenesque tendency of the populace, but when he came in one day\r\nand found her curled upon the sofa bent over "Peer Gynt" he\r\nlaughed and told her to forget what he\'d said--that it was all\r\nrot.\r\n\r\nThey had been walking homeward between mounds of high-piled snow\r\nand under a sun which Sally Carrol scarcely recognized. They\r\npassed a little girl done up in gray wool until she resembled a\r\nsmall Teddy bear, and Sally Carrol could not resist a gasp of\r\nmaternal appreciation.\r\n\r\n"Look! Harry!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"That little girl--did you see her face?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, why?"\r\n\r\n"It was red as a little strawberry.  Oh, she was cute!"\r\n\r\n"Why, your own face is almost as red as that already! Everybody\'s\r\nhealthy here.  We\'re out in the cold as soon as we\'re old enough\r\nto walk.  Wonderful climate!"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him and had to agree.  He was mighty\r\nhealthy-looking; so was his brother.  And she had noticed the new\r\nred in her own cheeks that very morning.\r\n\r\nSuddenly their glances were caught and held, and they stared for\r\na moment at the street-corner ahead of them.  A man was standing\r\nthere, his knees bent, his eyes gazing upward with a tense\r\nexpression as though he were about to make a leap toward the\r\nchilly sky.  And then they both exploded into a shout of\r\nlaughter, for coming closer they discovered it had been a\r\nludicrous momentary illusion produced by the extreme bagginess of\r\nthe man\'s trousers.\r\n\r\n"Reckon that\'s one on us," she laughed.\r\n\r\n"He must be Southerner, judging by those trousers," suggested\r\nHarry mischievously.\r\n\r\n"Why, Harry!"\r\n\r\nHer surprised look must have irritated him.\r\n\r\n"Those damn Southerners!"\r\n\r\nSally Carrol\'s eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call \'em that."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, dear," said Harry, malignantly apologetic, "but you\r\nknow what I think of them.  They\'re sort of--sort of\r\ndegenerates--not at all like the old Southerners.  They\'ve lived\r\nso long down there with all the colored people that they\'ve\r\ngotten lazy and shiftless."\r\n\r\n"Hush your mouth, Harry!" she cried angrily. "They\'re not! They\r\nmay be lazy--anybody would be in that climate--but they\'re my\r\nbest friends, an\' I don\'t want to hear \'em criticised in any such\r\nsweepin\' way. Some of \'em are the finest men in the world."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know. They\'re all right when they come North to college,\r\nbut of all the hangdog, ill-dressed, slovenly lot I ever saw, a\r\nbunch of small-town Southerners are the worst!"\r\n\r\nSally Carrol was clinching her gloved hands and biting her lip\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n"Why," continued Harry, "if there was one in my class at New\r\nHaven, and we all thought that at last we\'d found the true type\r\nof Southern aristocrat, but it turned out that he wasn\'t an\r\naristocrat at all--just the son of a Northern carpetbagger, who\r\nowned about all the cotton round Mobile."\r\n\r\n"A Southerner wouldn\'t talk the way you\'re talking now," she said\r\nevenly.\r\n\r\n"They haven\'t the energy!"\r\n\r\n"Or the somethin\' else."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry Sally Carrol, but I\'ve heard you say yourself that\r\nyou\'d never marry---"\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite different. I told you I wouldn\'t want to tie my\r\nlife to any of the boys that are round Tarleton now, but I never\r\nmade any sweepin\' generalities."\r\n\r\nThey walked along in silence.\r\n\r\n"I probably spread it on a bit thick Sally Carrol. I\'m sorry."\r\n\r\nShe nodded but made no answer.  Five minutes later as they stood\r\nin the hallway she suddenly threw her arms round him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry," she cried, her eyes brimming with tears; "let\'s get\r\nmarried next week. I\'m afraid of having fusses like that. I\'m\r\nafraid, Harry. It wouldn\'t be that way if we were married."\r\n\r\nBut Harry, being in the wrong, was still irritated.\r\n\r\n"That\'d be idiotic. We decided on March."\r\n\r\nThe tears in Sally Carrol\'s eyes faded; her expression hardened\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n"Very well--I suppose I shouldn\'t have said that."\r\n\r\nHarry melted.\r\n\r\n"Dear little nut!" he cried. "Come and kiss me and let\'s forget."\r\nThat very night at the end of a vaudeville performance the\r\norchestra played "Dixie" and Sally Carrol felt something stronger\r\nand more enduring than her tears and smiles of the day brim up\r\ninside her. She leaned forward gripping the arms of her chair\r\nuntil her face grew crimson.\r\n\r\n"Sort of get you dear?" whispered Harry.\r\n\r\nBut she did not hear him. To the limited throb of the violins and\r\nthe inspiring beat of the kettle-drums her own old ghosts were\r\nmarching by and on into the darkness, and as fifes whistled and\r\nsighed in the low encore they seemed so nearly out of sight that\r\nshe could have waved good-by.\r\n\r\n     "Away, Away,\r\n         Away down South in Dixie!\r\n      Away, away,\r\n         Away down South in Dixie!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a particularly cold night. A sudden thaw had nearly\r\ncleared the streets the day before, but now they were traversed\r\nagain with a powdery wraith of loose snow that travelled in wavy\r\nlines before the feet of the wind, and filled the lower air with\r\na fine-particled mist. There was no sky--only a dark, ominous\r\ntent that draped in the tops of the streets and was in reality a\r\nvast approaching army of snowflakes--while over it all, chilling\r\naway the comfort from the brown-and-green glow of lighted\r\nwindows and muffling the steady trot of the horse pulling their\r\nsleigh, interminably washed the north wind. It was a dismal town\r\nafter all, she though, dismal.\r\n\r\nSometimes at night it had seemed to her as though no one lived\r\nhere--they had all gone long ago--leaving lighted houses to be\r\ncovered in time by tombing heaps of sleet. Oh, if there should be\r\nsnow on her grave! To be beneath great piles of it all winter\r\nlong, where even her headstone would be a light shadow against\r\nlight shadows. Her grave--a grave that should be flower-strewn\r\nand washed with sun and rain.\r\n\r\nShe thought again of those isolated country houses that her train\r\nhad passed, and of the life there the long winter through--the\r\nceaseless glare through the windows, the crust forming on the\r\nsoft drifts of snow, finally the slow cheerless melting and the\r\nharsh spring of which Roger Patton had told her. Her spring--to\r\nlose it forever--with its lilacs and the lazy sweetness it\r\nstirred in her heart. She was laying away that spring--afterward\r\nshe would lay away that sweetness.\r\n\r\nWith a gradual insistence the storm broke. Sally Carrol felt a\r\nfilm of flakes melt quickly on her eyelashes, and Harry reached\r\nover a furry arm and drew down her complicated flannel cap. Then\r\nthe small flakes came in skirmish-line, and the horse bent his\r\nneck patiently as a transparency of white appeared momentarily on\r\nhis coat.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s cold, Harry," she said quickly.\r\n\r\n"Who? The horse? Oh, no, he isn\'t. He likes it!"\r\n\r\nAfter another ten minutes they turned a corner and came in sight\r\nof their destination. On a tall hill outlined in vivid glaring\r\ngreen against the wintry sky stood the ice palace. It was three\r\nstories in the air, with battlements and embrasures and narrow\r\nicicled windows, and the innumerable electric lights inside made\r\na gorgeous transparency of the great central hall. Sally Carrol\r\nclutched Harry\'s hand under the fur robe.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beautiful!" he cried excitedly. "My golly, it\'s beautiful,\r\nisn\'t it! They haven\'t had one here since eighty-five!"\r\n\r\nSomehow the notion of there not having been one since eighty-five\r\noppressed her. Ice was a ghost, and this mansion of it was\r\nsurely peopled by those shades of the eighties, with pale faces\r\nand blurred snow-filled hair.\r\n\r\n"Come on, dear," said Harry.\r\n\r\nShe followed him out of the sleigh and waited while he hitched\r\nthe horse. A party of four--Gordon, Myra, Roger Patton, and\r\nanother girl--drew up beside them with a mighty jingle of bells.\r\nThere were quite a crowd already, bundled in fur or sheepskin,\r\nshouting and calling to each other as they moved through the\r\nsnow, which was now so thick that people could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished a few yards away.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a hundred and seventy feet tall," Harry was saying to a\r\nmuffled figure beside him as they trudged toward the entrance;\r\n"covers six thousand square yards."\r\n\r\nShe caught snatches of conversation: "One main hall"--"walls\r\ntwenty to forty inches thick"--"and the ice cave has almost a\r\nmile of--"--"this Canuck who built it---"\r\n\r\nThey found their way inside, and dazed by the magic of the great\r\ncrystal walls Sally Carrol found herself repeating over and over\r\ntwo lines from "Kubla Khan":\r\n\r\n     "It was a miracle of rare device,\r\n      A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!"\r\n\r\nIn the great glittering cavern with the dark shut out she took a\r\nseat on a wooded bench and the evening\'s oppression lifted. Harry\r\nwas right--it was beautiful; and her gaze travelled the smooth\r\nsurface of the walls, the blocks for which had been selected for\r\ntheir purity and dearness to obtain this opalescent, translucent\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n"Look! Here we go--oh, boy!" cried Harry.\r\n\r\nA band in a far corner struck up "Hail, Hail, the Gang\'s All\r\nHere!" which echoed over to them in wild muddled acoustics, and\r\nthen the lights suddenly went out; silence seemed to flow down\r\nthe icy sides and sweep over them. Sally Carrol could still see\r\nher white breath in the darkness, and a dim row of pale faces\r\nover on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe music eased to a sighing complaint, and from outside drifted\r\nin the full-throated remnant chant of the marching clubs. It grew\r\nlouder like some p\xe6an of a viking tribe traversing an ancient\r\nwild; it swelled--they were coming nearer; then a row of torches\r\nappeared, and another and another, and keeping time with their\r\nmoccasined feet a long column of gray-mackinawed figures swept\r\nin, snow-shoes slung at their shoulders, torches soaring and\r\nflickering as their voice rose along the great walls.\r\n\r\nThe gray column ended and another followed, the light streaming\r\nluridly this time over red toboggan caps and flaming crimson\r\nmackinaws, and as they entered they took up the refrain; then\r\ncame a long platoon of blue and white, of green, of white, of\r\nbrown and yellow.\r\n\r\n"Those white ones are the Wacouta Club," whispered Harry eagerly.\r\n"Those are the men you\'ve met round at dances."\r\n\r\nThe volume of the voices grew; the great cavern was a\r\nphantasmagoria of torches waving in great banks of fire, of\r\ncolors and the rhythm of soft-leather steps. The leading column\r\nturned and halted, platoon deploys in front of platoon until the\r\nwhole procession made a solid flag of flame, and then from\r\nthousands of voices burst a mighty shout that filled the air like\r\na crash of thunder, and sent the torches wavering. It was\r\nmagnificent, it was tremendous! To Sally Carol it was the North\r\noffering sacrifice on some mighty altar to the gray pagan God of\r\nSnow. As the shout died the band struck up again and there came\r\nmore singing, and then long reverberating cheers by each club.\r\nShe sat very quiet listening while the staccato cries rent the\r\nstillness; and then she started, for there was a volley of\r\nexplosion, and great clouds of smoke went up here and there\r\nthrough the cavern--the flash-light photographers at work--and\r\nthe council was over. With the band at their head the clubs\r\nformed in column once more, took up their chant, and began to\r\nmarch out.\r\n\r\n"Come on!" shouted Harry. "We want to see the labyrinths\r\ndown-stairs before they turn the lights off!"\r\n\r\nThey all rose and started toward the chute--Harry and Sally\r\nCarrol in the lead, her little mitten buried in his big fur\r\ngantlet. At the bottom of the chute was a long empty room of ice,\r\nwith the ceiling so low that they had to stoop--and their hands\r\nwere parted. Before she realized what he intended Harry had\r\ndarted down one of the half-dozen glittering passages that\r\nopened into the room and was only a vague receding blot against\r\nthe green shimmer.\r\n\r\n"Harry!" she called.\r\n\r\n"Come on!" he cried back.\r\n\r\nShe looked round the empty chamber; the rest of the party had\r\nevidently decided to go home, were already outside somewhere in\r\nthe blundering snow. She hesitated and then darted in after\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n"Harry!" she shouted.\r\n\r\nShe had reached a turning-point thirty feet down; she heard a\r\nfaint muffled answer far to the left, and with a touch of panic\r\nfled toward it. She passed another turning, two more yawning\r\nalleys.\r\n\r\n"Harry!"\r\n\r\nNo answer. She started to run straight forward, and then turned\r\nlike lightning and sped back the way she had come, enveloped in a\r\nsudden icy terror.\r\n\r\nShe reached a turn--was it here?--took the left and came to what\r\nshould have been the outlet into the long, low room, but it was\r\nonly another glittering passage with darkness at the end. She\r\ncalled again, but the walls gave back a flat, lifeless echo with\r\nno reverberations. Retracing her steps she turned another corner,\r\nthis time following a wide passage. It was like the green lane\r\nbetween the parted water of the Red Sea, like a damp vault\r\nconnecting empty tombs.\r\n\r\nShe slipped a little now as she walked, for ice had formed on the\r\nbottom of her overshoes; she had to run her gloves along the\r\nhalf-slippery, half-sticky walls to keep her balance.\r\n\r\n"Harry!"\r\n\r\nStill no answer. The sound she made bounced mockingly down to the\r\nend of the passage.\r\n\r\nThen on an instant the lights went out, and she was in complete\r\ndarkness. She gave a small, frightened cry, and sank down into a\r\ncold little heap on the ice. She felt her left knee do something\r\nas she fell, but she scarcely noticed it as some deep terror far\r\ngreater than any fear of being lost settled upon her. She was\r\nalone with this presence that came out of the North, the dreary\r\nloneliness that rose from ice-bound whalers in the Arctic seas,\r\nfrom smokeless, trackless wastes where were strewn the whitened\r\nbones of adventure. It was an icy breath of death; it was rolling\r\ndown low across the land to clutch at her.\r\n\r\nWith a furious, despairing energy she rose again and started\r\nblindly down the darkness. She must get out. She might be lost in\r\nhere for days, freeze to death and lie embedded in the ice like\r\ncorpses she had read of, kept perfectly preserved until the\r\nmelting of a glacier. Harry probably thought she had left with\r\nthe others--he had gone by now; no one would know until next day.\r\nShe reached pitifully for the wall. Forty inches thick, they had\r\nsaid--forty inches thick!\r\n\r\nOn both sides of her along the walls she felt things creeping,\r\ndamp souls that haunted this palace, this town, this North.\r\n\r\n"Oh, send somebody--send somebody!" she cried aloud.\r\n\r\nClark Darrow--he would understand; or Joe Ewing; she couldn\'t be\r\nleft here to wander forever--to be frozen, heart, body, and soul.\r\nThis her--this Sally Carrol! Why, she was a happy thing. She\r\nwas a happy little girl. She liked warmth and summer and Dixie.\r\nThese things were foreign--foreign.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not crying," something said aloud. "You\'ll never cry any\r\nmore. Your tears would just freeze; all tears freeze up here!"\r\n\r\nShe sprawled full length on the ice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, God!" she faltered.\r\n\r\nA long single file of minutes went by, and with a great weariness\r\nshe felt her eyes dosing. Then some one seemed to sit down near\r\nher and take her face in warm, soft hands. She looked up\r\ngratefully.\r\n\r\n"Why it\'s Margery Lee," she crooned softly to herself. "I knew\r\nyou\'d come." It really was Margery Lee, and she was just as Sally\r\nCarrol had known she would be, with a young, white brow, and\r\nwide welcoming eyes, and a hoop-skirt of some soft material that\r\nwas quite comforting to rest on.\r\n\r\n"Margery Lee."\r\n\r\nIt was getting darker now and darker--all those tombstones ought\r\nto be repainted sure enough, only that would spoil \'em, of\r\ncourse. Still, you ought to be able to see \'em.\r\n\r\nThen after a succession of moments that went fast and then slow,\r\nbut seemed to be ultimately resolving themselves into a multitude\r\nof blurred rays converging toward a pale-yellow sun, she heard a\r\ngreat cracking noise break her new-found stillness.\r\n\r\nIt was the sun, it was a light; a torch, and a torch beyond that,\r\nand another one, and voices; a face took flesh below the torch,\r\nheavy arms raised her and she felt something on her cheek--it\r\nfelt wet. Some one had seized her and was rubbing her face with\r\nsnow. How ridiculous--with snow!\r\n\r\n"Sally Carrol! Sally Carrol!"\r\n\r\nIt was Dangerous Dan McGrew; and two other faces she didn\'t know.\r\n"Child, child! We\'ve been looking for you two hours! Harry\'s\r\nhalf-crazy!"\r\n\r\nThings came rushing back into place--the singing, the torches,\r\nthe great shout of the marching clubs. She squirmed in Patton\'s\r\narms and gave a long low cry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I want to get out of here! I\'m going back home. Take me\r\nhome"---her voice rose to a scream that sent a chill to Harry\'s\r\nheart as he came racing down the next passage--"to-morrow!" she\r\ncried with delirious, unstrained passion--"To-morrow! To-morrow!\r\nTo-morrow!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wealth of golden sunlight poured a quite enervating yet oddly\r\ncomforting heat over the house where day long it faced the dusty\r\nstretch of road. Two birds were making a great to-do in a cool\r\nspot found among the branches of a tree next door, and down the\r\nstreet a colored woman was announcing herself melodiously as a\r\npurveyor of strawberries. It was April afternoon.\r\n\r\nSally Carrol Happer, resting her chin on her arm, and her arm on\r\nan old window-seat, gazed sleepily down over the spangled dust\r\nwhence the heat waves were rising for the first time this spring.\r\nShe was watching a very ancient Ford turn a perilous corner and\r\nrattle and groan to a jolting stop at the end of the walk. See\r\nmade no sound and in a minute a strident familiar whistle rent\r\nthe air. Sally Carrol smiled and blinked.\r\n\r\n"Good mawnin\'."\r\n\r\nA head appeared tortuously from under the car-top below.\r\n\r\n"Tain\'t mawnin\', Sally Carrol."\r\n\r\n"Sure enough!" she said in affected surprise. "I guess maybe\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"What you doin\'?"\r\n\r\n"Eatin\' a green peach. \'Spect to die any minute."\r\n\r\nClark twisted himself a last impossible notch to get a view of\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n"Water\'s warm as a kettla steam, Sally Carol. Wanta go swimmin\'?"\r\n\r\n"Hate to move," sighed Sally Carol lazily, "but I reckon so."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHead and Shoulders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Horace Tarbox was thirteen years old. In that year he\r\ntook the examinations for entrance to Princeton University and\r\nreceived the Grade A--excellent--in C\xe6sar, Cicero, Vergil,\r\nXenophon, Homer, Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, and\r\nChemistry.\r\n\r\nTwo years later while George M. Cohan was composing "Over There,"\r\nHorace was leading the sophomore class by several lengths and\r\ndigging out theses on "The Syllogism as an Obsolete Scholastic\r\nForm," and during the battle of Ch\xe2teau-Thierry he was sitting at\r\nhis desk deciding whether or not to wait until his seventeenth\r\nbirthday before beginning his series of essays on "The Pragmatic\r\nBias of the New Realists."\r\n\r\nAfter a while some newsboy told him that the war was over, and he\r\nwas glad, because it meant that Peat Brothers, publishers, would\r\nget out their new edition of "Spinoza\'s Improvement of the\r\nUnderstanding." Wars were all very well in their way, made young\r\nmen self-reliant or something but Horace felt that he could never\r\nforgive the President for allowing a brass band to play under\r\nhis window the night of the false armistice, causing him to leave\r\nthree important sentences out of his thesis on "German\r\nIdealism."\r\n\r\nThe next year he went up to Yale to take his degree as Master of\r\nArts.\r\n\r\nHe was seventeen then, tall and slender, with near-sighted gray\r\neyes and an air of keeping himself utterly detached from the mere\r\nwords he let drop.\r\n\r\n"I never feel as though I\'m talking to him," expostulated\r\nProfessor Dillinger to a sympathetic colleague. "He makes me feel\r\nas though I were talking to his representative. I always expect\r\nhim to say: \'Well, I\'ll ask myself and find out.\'"\r\n\r\nAnd then, just as nonchalantly as though Horace Tarbox had been\r\nMr. Beef the butcher or Mr. Hat the haberdasher, life reached in,\r\nseized him,  handled him, stretched him, and unrolled him like a\r\npiece of Irish lace on a Saturday-afternoon bargain-counter.\r\n\r\nTo move in the literary fashion I should say that this was all\r\nbecause when way back in colonial days the hardy pioneers had\r\ncome to a bald place in Connecticut and asked of each other,\r\n"Now, what shall we build here?" the hardiest one among \'em had\r\nanswered: "Let\'s build a town where theatrical managers can try\r\nout musical comedies!" How afterward they founded Yale College\r\nthere, to try the musical comedies on, is a story every one\r\nknows. At any rate one December, "Home James" opened at the\r\nShubert, and all the students encored Marcia Meadow, who sang a\r\nsong about the Blundering Blimp in the first act and did a shaky,\r\nshivery, celebrated dance in the last.\r\n\r\nMarcia was nineteen. She didn\'t have wings, but audiences agreed\r\ngenerally that she didn\'t need them. She was a blonde by natural\r\npigment, and she wore no paint on the streets at high noon.\r\nOutside of that she was no better than most women.\r\n\r\nIt was Charlie Moon who promised her five thousand Pall Malls if\r\nshe would pay a call on Horace Tarbox, prodigy extraordinary.\r\nCharlie was a senior in Sheffield, and he and Horace were first\r\ncousins. They liked and pitied each other.\r\n\r\nHorace had been particularly busy that night. The failure of the\r\nFrenchman Laurier to appreciate the significance of the new\r\nrealists was preying on his mind. In fact, his only reaction to a\r\nlow, clear-cut rap at his study was to make him speculate as to\r\nwhether any rap would have actual existence without an ear there\r\nto hear it. He fancied he was verging more and more toward\r\npragmatism. But at that moment, though he did not know it, he was\r\nverging with astounding rapidity toward something quite\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe rap sounded--three seconds leaked by--the rap sounded.\r\n\r\n"Come in," muttered Horace automatically.\r\n\r\nHe heard the door open and then close, but, bent over his book in\r\nthe big armchair before the fire, he did not look up.\r\n\r\n"Leave it on the bed in the other room," he said absently.\r\n\r\n"Leave what on the bed in the other room?"\r\n\r\nMarcia Meadow had to talk her songs, but her speaking voice was\r\nlike byplay on a harp.\r\n\r\n"The laundry."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t."\r\n\r\nHorace stirred impatiently in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, because I haven\'t got it."\r\n\r\n"Hm!" he replied testily. "Suppose you go back and get it."\r\n\r\nAcross the fire from Horace was another easychair. He was\r\naccustomed to change to it in the course of an evening by way of\r\nexercise and variety. One chair he called Berkeley, the other he\r\ncalled Hume. He suddenly heard a sound as of a rustling,\r\ndiaphanous form sinking into Hume. He glanced up.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Marcia with the sweet smile she used in Act Two\r\n("Oh, so the Duke liked my dancing!") "Well, Omar Khayyam, here I\r\nam beside you singing in the wilderness."\r\n\r\nHorace stared at her dazedly. The momentary suspicion came to him\r\nthat she existed there only as a phantom of his imagination.\r\nWomen didn\'t come into men\'s rooms and sink into men\'s Humes.\r\nWomen brought laundry and took your seat in the street-car and\r\nmarried you later on when you were old enough to know fetters.\r\n\r\nThis woman had clearly materialized out of Hume. The very froth\r\nof her brown gauzy dress was art emanation from Hume\'s leather\r\narm there! If he looked long enough he would see Hume right\r\nthrough her and then he would be alone again in the room. He\r\npassed his fist across his eyes. He really must take up those\r\ntrapeze exercises again.\r\n\r\n"For Pete\'s sake, don\'t look so critical!" objected the emanation\r\npleasantly. "I feel as if you were going to wish me away with\r\nthat patent dome of yours. And then there wouldn\'t be anything\r\nleft of me except my shadow in your eyes."\r\n\r\nHorace coughed. Coughing was one of his two gestures. When he\r\ntalked you forgot he had a body at all. It was like hearing a\r\nphonograph record by a singer who had been dead a long time.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I want them letters," whined Marcia melodramatically--"them\r\nletters of mine you bought from my grandsire in 1881."\r\n\r\nHorace considered.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t got your letters," he said evenly. "I am only\r\nseventeen years old. My father was not born until March 3, 1879.\r\nYou evidently have me confused with some one else."\r\n\r\n"You\'re only seventeen?" repeated March suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Only seventeen."\r\n\r\n"I knew a girl," said Marcia reminiscently, "who went on the\r\nten-twenty-thirty when she was sixteen. She was so stuck on\r\nherself that she could never say \'sixteen\' without putting the\r\n\'only\' before it. We got to calling her \'Only Jessie.\' And she\'s\r\njust where she was when she started--only worse. \'Only\' is a bad\r\nhabit, Omar--it sounds like an alibi."\r\n\r\n"My name is not Omar."\r\n\r\n"I know," agreed Marcia, nodding--"your name\'s Horace. I just\r\ncall you Omar because you remind me of a smoked cigarette."\r\n\r\n"And I haven\'t your letters. I doubt if I\'ve ever met your\r\ngrandfather. In fact, I think it very improbable that you\r\nyourself were alive in 1881."\r\n\r\nMarcia stared at him in wonder.\r\n\r\n"Me--1881? Why sure! I was second-line stuff when the Florodora\r\nSextette was still in the convent. I was the original nurse to\r\nMrs. Sol Smith\'s Juliette. Why, Omar, I was a canteen singer\r\nduring the War of 1812."\r\n\r\nHorace\'s mind made a sudden successful leap, and he grinned.\r\n\r\n"Did Charlie Moon put you up to this?"\r\n\r\nMarcia regarded him inscrutably.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s Charlie Moon?"\r\n\r\n"Small--wide nostrils--big ears."\r\n\r\nShe grew several inches and sniffed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not in the habit of noticing my friends\' nostrils.\r\n\r\n"Then it was Charlie?"\r\n\r\nMarcia bit her lip--and then yawned.  "Oh, let\'s change the\r\nsubject, Omar. I\'ll pull a snore in this chair in a minute."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Horace gravely, "Hume has often been considered\r\nsoporific---"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s your friend--and will he die?"\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden Horace Tarbox rose slenderly and began to pace\r\nthe room with his hands in his pockets. This was his other\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for this," he said as if he were talking to\r\nhimself--"at all. Not that I mind your being here--I don\'t.\r\nYou\'re quite a pretty little thing, but I don\'t like Charlie\r\nMoon\'s sending you up here. Am I a laboratory experiment on which\r\nthe janitors as well as the chemists can make experiments? Is my\r\nintellectual development humorous in any way? Do I look like the\r\npictures of the little Boston boy in the comic magazines? Has\r\nthat callow ass, Moon, with his eternal tales about his week in\r\nParis, any right to---"\r\n\r\n"No," interrupted Marcia emphatically.  "And you\'re a sweet boy.\r\nCome here and kiss me."\r\n\r\nHorace stopped quickly in front of her.\r\n\r\n"Why do you want me to kiss you?" he asked intently, "Do you just\r\ngo round kissing people?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," admitted Marcia, unruffled. "\'At\'s all life is. Just\r\ngoing round kissing people."\r\n\r\n"Well," replied Horace emphatically, "I must say your ideas are\r\nhorribly garbled! In the first place life isn\'t just that, and in\r\nthe second place. I won\'t kiss you. It might get to be a habit\r\nand I can\'t get rid of habits. This year I\'ve got in the habit of\r\nlolling in bed until seven-thirty---"\r\n\r\nMarcia nodded understandingly.\r\n\r\n"Do you ever have any fun?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by fun?"\r\n\r\n"See here," said Marcia sternly, "I like you, Omar, but I wish\r\nyou\'d talk as if you had a line on what you were saying. You\r\nsound as if you were gargling a lot of words in your mouth and\r\nlost a bet every time you spilled a few. I asked you if you ever\r\nhad any fun."\r\n\r\nHorace shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Later, perhaps," he answered. "You see I\'m a plan. I\'m an\r\nexperiment. I don\'t say that I don\'t get tired of it sometimes--I\r\ndo. Yet--oh, I can\'t explain! But what you and Charlie Moon call\r\nfun wouldn\'t be fun to me."\r\n\r\n"Please explain."\r\n\r\nHorace stared at her, started to speak and then, changing his\r\nmind, resumed his walk. After an unsuccessful attempt to\r\ndetermine whether or not he was looking at her Marcia smiled at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Please explain."\r\n\r\nHorace turned.\r\n\r\n"If I do, will you promise to tell Charlie Moon that I wasn\'t\r\nin?"\r\n\r\n"Uh-uh."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then. Here\'s my history: I was a \'why\' child. I\r\nwanted to see the wheels go round. My father was a young\r\neconomics professor at Princeton. He brought me up on the system\r\nof answering every question I asked him to the best of his\r\nability. My response to that gave him the idea of making an\r\nexperiment in precocity. To aid in the massacre I had ear\r\ntrouble--seven operations between the age of nine and twelve. Of\r\ncourse this kept me apart from other boys and made me ripe for\r\nforcing. Anyway, while my generation was laboring through Uncle\r\nRemus I was honestly enjoying Catullus in the original.\r\n\r\n"I passed off my college examinations when I was thirteen because\r\nI couldn\'t help it. My chief associates were professors, and I\r\ntook a tremendous pride in knowing that I had a fine\r\nintelligence, for though I was unusually gifted I was not\r\nabnormal in other ways. When I was sixteen I got tired of being a\r\nfreak; I decided that some one had made a bad mistake. Still as\r\nI\'d gone that far I concluded to finish it up by taking my degree\r\nof Master of Arts. My chief interest in life is the study of\r\nmodern philosophy. I am a realist of the School of Anton\r\nLaurier--with Bergsonian trimmings--and I\'ll be eighteen years\r\nold in two months. That\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Whew!" exclaimed Marcia. "That\'s enough! You do a neat job with\r\nthe parts of speech."\r\n\r\n"Satisfied?"\r\n\r\n"No, you haven\'t kissed me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not in my programme," demurred Horace. "Understand that I\r\ndon\'t pretend to be above physical things. They have their place,\r\nbut---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be so darned reasonable!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"I hate these slot-machine people."\r\n\r\n"I assure you I---" began Horace.\r\n\r\n"Oh shut up!"\r\n\r\n"My own rationality---"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say anything about your nationality. You\'re Amuricun,\r\nar\'n\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s O.K. with me.  I got a notion I want to see you do\r\nsomething that isn\'t in your highbrow programme. I want to see if\r\na what-ch-call-em with Brazilian trimmings--that thing you said\r\nyou were--can be a little human."\r\n\r\nHorace shook his head again.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t kiss you."\r\n\r\n"My life is blighted," muttered Marcia tragically. "I\'m a beaten\r\nwoman. I\'ll go through life without ever having a kiss with\r\nBrazilian trimmings." She sighed. "Anyways, Omar, will you come\r\nand see my show?"\r\n\r\n"What show?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a wicked actress from \'Home James\'!"\r\n\r\n"Light opera?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--at a stretch. One of the characters is a Brazilian\r\nrice-planter. That might interest you."\r\n\r\n"I saw \'The Bohemian Girl\' once," reflected Horace aloud. "I\r\nenjoyed it--to some extent---"\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll come?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m--I\'m---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know--you\'ve got to run down to Brazil for the week-end."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I\'d be delighted to come---"\r\n\r\nMarcia clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n"Goodyforyou! I\'ll mail you a ticket--Thursday night?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I---"\r\n\r\n"Good! Thursday night it is."\r\n\r\nShe stood up and walking close to him laid both hands on his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n"I like you, Omar.  I\'m sorry I tried to kid you. I thought you\'d\r\nbe sort of frozen, but you\'re a nice boy."\r\n\r\nHe eyed her sardonically.\r\n\r\n"I\'m several thousand generations older than you are."\r\n\r\n"You carry your age well."\r\n\r\nThey shook hands gravely.\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Marcia Meadow," she said emphatically. "\'Member it--\r\nMarcia Meadow. And I won\'t tell Charlie Moon you were in."\r\n\r\nAn instant later as she was skimming down the last flight of\r\nstairs three at a time she heard a voice call over the upper\r\nbanister: "Oh, say---"\r\n\r\nShe stopped and looked up--made out a vague form leaning over.\r\n\r\n"Oh, say!" called the prodigy again. "Can you hear me?"\r\n\r\n"Here\'s your connection Omar."\r\n\r\n"I hope I haven\'t given you the impression that I consider\r\nkissing intrinsically irrational."\r\n\r\n"Impression? Why, you didn\'t even give me the kiss! Never\r\nfret--so long."\r\n\r\nTwo doors near her opened curiously at the sound of a feminine\r\nvoice. A tentative cough sounded from above. Gathering her\r\nskirts, Marcia dived wildly down the last flight, and was\r\nswallowed up in the murky Connecticut air outside.\r\n\r\nUp-stairs Horace paced the floor of his study. From time to time\r\nhe glanced toward Berkeley waiting there in suave dark-red\r\nreputability, an open book lying suggestively on his cushions.\r\nAnd then he found that his circuit of the floor was bringing him\r\neach time nearer to Hume. There was something about Hume that was\r\nstrangely and inexpressibly different. The diaphanous form still\r\nseemed hovering near, and had Horace sat there he would have\r\nfelt as if he were sitting on a lady\'s lap. And though Horace\r\ncouldn\'t have named the quality of difference, there was such a\r\nquality--quite intangible to the speculative mind, but real,\r\nnevertheless. Hume was radiating something that in all the two\r\nhundred years of his influence he had never radiated before.\r\n\r\nHume was radiating attar of roses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday night Horace Tarbox sat in an aisle seat in the fifth\r\nrow and witnessed "Home James." Oddly enough he found that he\r\nwas enjoying himself. The cynical students near him were annoyed\r\nat his audible appreciation of time-honored jokes in the\r\nHammerstein tradition. But Horace was waiting with anxiety for\r\nMarcia Meadow singing her song about a Jazz-bound Blundering\r\nBlimp. When she did appear, radiant under a floppity flower-faced\r\nhat, a warm glow settled over him, and when the song was over he\r\ndid not join in the storm of applause. He felt somewhat numb.\r\n\r\nIn the intermission after the second act an usher materialized\r\nbeside him, demanded to know if he were Mr. Tarbox, and then\r\nhanded him a note written in a round adolescent band. Horace read\r\nit in some confusion, while the usher lingered with withering\r\npatience in the aisle.\r\n\r\n"Dear Omar: After the show I always grow an awful hunger. If you\r\nwant to satisfy it for me in the Taft Grill just communicate your\r\nanswer to the big-timber guide that brought this and oblige.\r\n                        Your friend,\r\n                                                 Marcia Meadow."\r\n\r\n"Tell her,"--he coughed--"tell her that it will be quite all\r\nright. I\'ll meet her in front of the theatre."\r\n\r\nThe big-timber guide smiled arrogantly.\r\n\r\n"I giss she meant for you to come roun\' t\' the stage door."\r\n\r\n"Where--where is it?"\r\n\r\n"Ou\'side. Tunayulef. Down ee alley."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Ou\'side. Turn to y\' left! Down ee alley!"\r\n\r\nThe arrogant person withdrew. A freshman behind Horace snickered.\r\n\r\nThen half an hour later, sitting in the Taft Grill opposite the\r\nhair that was yellow by natural pigment, the prodigy was saying\r\nan odd thing.\r\n\r\n"Do you have to do that dance in the last act?" he was asking\r\nearnestly--"I mean, would they dismiss you if you refused to do it?"\r\n\r\nMarcia grinned.\r\n\r\n"It\'s fun to do it. I like to do it."\r\n\r\nAnd then Horace came out with a FAUX PAS.\r\n\r\n"I should think you\'d detest it," he remarked succinctly. "The\r\npeople behind me were making remarks about your bosom."\r\n\r\nMarcia blushed fiery red.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that," she said quickly. "The dance to me is only\r\na sort of acrobatic stunt. Lord, it\'s hard enough to do! I rub\r\nliniment into my shoulders for an hour every night."\r\n\r\n"Do you have--fun while you\'re on the stage?"\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh--sure! I got in the habit of having people look at me,\r\nOmar, and I like it."\r\n\r\n"Hm!" Horace sank into a brownish study.\r\n\r\n"How\'s the Brazilian trimmings?"\r\n\r\n"Hm!" repeated Horace, and then after a pause: "Where does the\r\nplay go from here?"\r\n\r\n"New York."\r\n\r\n"For how long?"\r\n\r\n"All depends.  Winter--maybe."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"Coming up to lay eyes on me, Omar, or aren\'t you int\'rested?\r\nNot as nice here, is it, as it was up in your room?  I wish we\r\nwas there now."\r\n\r\n"I feel idiotic in this place," confessed Horace, looking round\r\nhim nervously.\r\n\r\n"Too bad!  We got along pretty well."\r\n\r\nAt this he looked suddenly so melancholy that she changed her\r\ntone, and reaching over patted his hand.\r\n\r\n"Ever take an actress out to supper before?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Horace miserably, "and I never will again. I don\'t\r\nknow why I came to-night. Here under all these lights and with\r\nall these people laughing and chattering I feel completely out\r\nof my sphere. I don\'t know what to talk to you about."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll talk about me. We talked about you last time."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\n"Well, my name really is Meadow, but my first name isn\'t Marcia--\r\nit\'s Veronica. I\'m nineteen. Question--how did the girl make\r\nher leap to the footlights? Answer--she was born in Passaic, New\r\nJersey, and up to a year ago she got the right to breathe by\r\npushing Nabiscoes in Marcel\'s tea-room in Trenton. She started\r\ngoing with a guy named Robbins, a singer in the Trent House\r\ncabaret, and he got her to try a song and dance with him one\r\nevening. In a month we were filling the supper-room every night.\r\nThen we went to New York with meet-my-friend letters thick as a\r\npile of napkins.\r\n\r\n"In two days we landed a job at Divinerries\', and I learned to\r\nshimmy from a kid at the Palais Royal. We stayed at Divinerries\'\r\nsix months until one night Peter Boyce Wendell, the columnist,\r\nate his milk-toast there. Next morning a poem about Marvellous\r\nMarcia came out in his newspaper, and within two days I had\r\nthree vaudeville offers and a chance at the Midnight Frolic. I\r\nwrote Wendell a thank-you letter, and he printed it in his\r\ncolumn--said that the style was like Carlyle\'s, only more\r\nrugged and that I ought to quit dancing and do North American\r\nliterature. This got me a coupla more vaudeville offers and a\r\nchance as an ing\xe9nue in a regular show. I took it--and here I\r\nam, Omar."\r\n\r\nWhen she finished they sat for a moment in silence she draping\r\nthe last skeins of a Welsh rabbit on her fork and waiting for\r\nhim to speak.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s get out of here," he said suddenly.\r\n\r\nMarcia\'s eyes hardened.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the idea? Am I making you sick?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I don\'t like it here. I don\'t like to be sitting here\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\nWithout another word Marcia signalled for the waiter.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the check?" she demanded briskly "My part--the rabbit\r\nand the ginger ale."\r\n\r\nHorace watched blankly as the waiter figured it.\r\n\r\n"See here," he began, "I intended to pay for yours too. You\'re\r\nmy guest."\r\n\r\nWith a half-sigh Marcia rose from the table and walked from the\r\nroom. Horace, his face a document in bewilderment, laid a bill\r\ndown and followed her out, up the stairs and into the lobby. He\r\novertook her in front of the elevator and they faced each other.\r\n\r\n"See here," he repeated "You\'re my guest. Have I said something to\r\noffend you?"\r\n\r\nAfter an instant of wonder Marcia\'s eyes softened.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a rude fella!" she said slowly. "Don\'t you know you\'re\r\nrude?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it," said Horace with a directness she found quite\r\ndisarming. "You know I like you."\r\n\r\n"You said you didn\'t like being with me."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Fire blazed suddenly from the gray forests of his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Because I didn\'t. I\'ve formed the habit of liking you. I\'ve\r\nbeen thinking of nothing much else for two days."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you---"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," he interrupted. "I\'ve got something to say. It\'s\r\nthis: in six weeks I\'ll be eighteen years old. When I\'m\r\neighteen years old I\'m coming up to New York to see you. Is\r\nthere some place in New York where we can go and not have a lot\r\nof people in the room?"\r\n\r\n"Sure!" smiled Marcia. "You can come up to my \'partment. Sleep\r\non the couch if you want to."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t sleep on couches," he said shortly. "But I want to talk\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Why, sure," repeated Marcia, "in my \'partment."\r\n\r\nIn his excitement Horace put his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n"All right--just so I can see you alone. I want to talk to you\r\nas we talked up in my room."\r\n\r\n"Honey boy," cried Marcia, laughing, "is it that you want to kiss\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Horace almost shouted. "I\'ll kiss you if you want me to."\r\n\r\nThe elevator man was looking at them reproachfully. Marcia edged\r\ntoward the grated door.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll drop you a post-card," she said.\r\n\r\nHorace\'s eyes were quite wild.\r\n\r\n"Send me a post-card! I\'ll come up any time after January first.\r\nI\'ll be eighteen then."\r\n\r\nAnd as she stepped into the elevator he coughed enigmatically,\r\nyet with a vague challenge, at the calling, and walked quickly\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was there again. She saw him when she took her first glance\r\nat the restless Manhattan audience--down in the front row with\r\nhis head bent a bit forward and his gray eyes fixed on her. And\r\nshe knew that to him they were alone together in a world where\r\nthe high-rouged row of ballet faces and the massed whines of the\r\nviolins were as imperceivable as powder on a marble Venus. An\r\ninstinctive defiance rose within her.\r\n\r\n"Silly boy!" she said to herself hurriedly, and she didn\'t take\r\nher encore.\r\n\r\n"What do they expect for a hundred a week--perpetual motion?"\r\nshe grumbled to herself in the wings.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the trouble? Marcia?"\r\n\r\n"Guy I don\'t like down in front."\r\n\r\nDuring the last act as she waited for her specialty she had an\r\nodd attack of stage fright. She had never sent Horace the\r\npromised post-card. Last night she had pretended not to see him--\r\nhad hurried from the theatre immediately after her dance to\r\npass a sleepless night in her apartment, thinking--as she had\r\nso often in the last month--of his pale, rather intent face, his\r\nslim, boyish fore, the merciless, unworldly abstraction that\r\nmade him charming to her.\r\n\r\nAnd now that he had come she felt vaguely sorry--as though an\r\nunwonted responsibility was being forced on her.\r\n\r\n"Infant prodigy!" she said aloud.\r\n\r\n"What?" demanded the negro comedian standing beside her.\r\n\r\n"Nothing--just talking about myself."\r\n\r\nOn the stage she felt better. This was her dance--and she\r\nalways felt that the way she did it wasn\'t suggestive any more\r\nthan to some men every pretty girl is suggestive. She made it\r\na stunt.\r\n\r\n     "Uptown, downtown, jelly on a spoon,\r\n      After sundown shiver by the moon."\r\n\r\nHe was not watching her now. She saw that clearly. He was looking\r\nvery deliberately at a castle on the back drop, wearing that\r\nexpression he had worn in the Taft Grill. A wave of exasperation\r\nswept over her--he was criticising her.\r\n\r\n     "That\'s the vibration that thrills me,\r\n      Funny how affection fi-lls me\r\n            Uptown, downtown---"\r\n\r\nUnconquerable revulsion seized her. She was suddenly and horribly\r\nconscious of her audience as she had never been since her first\r\nappearance. Was that a leer on a pallid face in the front row, a\r\ndroop of disgust on one young girl\'s mouth? These shoulders of\r\nhers--these shoulders shaking--were they hers? Were they real?\r\nSurely shoulders weren\'t made for this!\r\n\r\n     "Then--you\'ll see at a glance\r\n      I\'ll need some funeral ushers with St. Vitus dance\r\n      At the end of the world I\'ll---"\r\n\r\nThe bassoon and two cellos crashed into a final chord. She paused\r\nand poised a moment on her toes with every muscle tense, her\r\nyoung face looking out dully at the audience in what one young\r\ngirl afterward called "such a curious, puzzled look," and then\r\nwithout bowing rushed from the stage. Into the dressing-room she\r\nsped, kicked out of one dress and into another, and caught a taxi\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nHer apartment was very warm--small, it was, with a row of\r\nprofessional pictures and sets of Kipling and O. Henry which she\r\nhad bought once from a blue-eyed agent and read occasionally. And\r\nthere were several chairs which matched, but were none of them\r\ncomfortable, and a pink-shaded lamp with blackbirds painted on it\r\nand an atmosphere of other stifled pink throughout. There were\r\nnice things in it--nice things unrelentingly hostile to each\r\nother, offspring of a vicarious, impatient taste acting in stray\r\nmoments. The worst was typified by a great picture framed in oak\r\nbark of Passaic as seen from the Erie Railroad--altogether a\r\nfrantic, oddly extravagant, oddly penurious attempt to make a\r\ncheerful room. Marcia knew it was a failure.\r\n\r\nInto this room came the prodigy and took her two hands awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"I followed you this time," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"I want you to marry me," he said.\r\n\r\nHer arms went out to him. She kissed his mouth with a sort of\r\npassionate wholesomeness.\r\n\r\n"There!"\r\n\r\n"I love you," he said.\r\n\r\nShe kissed him again and then with a little sigh flung herself\r\ninto an armchair and half lay there, shaken with absurd laughter.\r\n\r\n"Why, you infant prodigy!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"Very well, call me that if you want to. I once told you that I\r\nwas ten thousand years older than you--I am."\r\n\r\nShe laughed again.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to be disapproved of."\r\n\r\n"No one\'s ever going to disapprove of you again."\r\n\r\n"Omar," she asked, "why do you want to marry me?"\r\n\r\nThe prodigy rose and put his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n"Because I love you, Marcia Meadow."\r\n\r\nAnd then she stopped calling him Omar.\r\n\r\n"Dear boy," she said, "you know I sort of love you. There\'s\r\nsomething about you--I can\'t tell what--that just puts my heart\r\nthrough the wringer every time I\'m round you. But honey--" She\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"But lots of things. But you\'re only just eighteen, and I\'m\r\nnearly twenty."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" he interrupted. "Put it this way--that I\'m in my\r\nnineteenth year and you\'re nineteen. That makes us pretty\r\nclose--without counting that other ten thousand years I\r\nmentioned."\r\n\r\nMarcia laughed.\r\n\r\n"But there are some more \'buts.\' Your people---\r\n\r\n"My people!" exclaimed the prodigy ferociously. "My people tried\r\nto make a monstrosity out of me." His face grew quite crimson at\r\nthe enormity of what he was going to say. "My people can go way\r\nback and sit down!"\r\n\r\n"My heavens!" cried Marcia in alarm. "All that? On tacks, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\n"Tacks--yes," he agreed wildly--"on anything. The more I think of\r\nhow they allowed me to become a little dried-up mummy---"\r\n\r\n"What makes you thank you\'re that?" asked Marcia quietly--"me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Every person I\'ve met on the streets since I met you has\r\nmade me jealous because they knew what love was before I did. I\r\nused to call it the \'sex impulse.\' Heavens!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s more \'buts,\'" said Marcia\r\n\r\n"What are they?"\r\n\r\n"How could we live?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make a living."\r\n\r\n"You\'re in college."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I care anything about taking a Master of Arts\r\ndegree?"\r\n\r\n"You want to be Master of Me, hey?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! What? I mean, no!"\r\n\r\nMarcia laughed, and crossing swiftly over sat in his lap. He put\r\nhis arm round her wildly and implanted the vestige of a kiss\r\nsomewhere near her neck.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something white about you," mused Marcia "but it doesn\'t\r\nsound very logical."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be so darned reasonable!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it," said Marcia.\r\n\r\n"I hate these slot-machine people!"\r\n\r\n"But we---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up!"\r\n\r\nAnd as Marcia couldn\'t talk through her ears she had to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace and Marcia were married early in February. The sensation\r\nin academic circles both at Yale and Princeton was tremendous.\r\nHorace Tarbox, who at fourteen had been played up in the Sunday\r\nmagazines sections of metropolitan newspapers, was throwing over\r\nhis career, his chance of being a world authority on American\r\nphilosophy, by marrying a chorus girl--they made Marcia a chorus\r\ngirl. But like all modern stories it was a four-and-a-half-day\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nThey took a flat in Harlem. After two weeks\' search, during which\r\nhis idea of the value of academic knowledge faded unmercifully,\r\nHorace took a position as clerk with a South American export\r\ncompany--some one had told him that exporting was the coming\r\nthing. Marcia was to stay in her show for a few months--anyway\r\nuntil he got on his feet. He was getting a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five to start with, and though of course they told him it\r\nwas only a question of months until he would be earning double\r\nthat, Marcia refused even to consider giving up the hundred and\r\nfifty a week that she was getting at the time.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll call ourselves Head and Shoulders, dear," she said softly,\r\n"and the shoulders\'ll have to keep shaking a little longer until\r\nthe old head gets started."\r\n\r\n"I hate it," he objected gloomily.\r\n\r\n"Well," she replied emphatically, "Your salary wouldn\'t keep us\r\nin a tenement. Don\'t think I want to be public--I don\'t. I want\r\nto be yours. But I\'d be a half-wit to sit in one room and count\r\nthe sunflowers on the wall-paper while I waited for you. When you\r\npull down three hundred a month I\'ll quit."\r\n\r\nAnd much as it hurt his pride, Horace had to admit that hers was\r\nthe wiser course.\r\n\r\nMarch mellowed into April. May read a gorgeous riot act to the\r\nparks and waters of Manhatten, and they were very happy. Horace,\r\nwho had no habits whatsoever--he had never had time to form\r\nany--proved the most adaptable of husbands, and as Marcia\r\nentirely lacked opinions on the subjects that engrossed him there\r\nwere very few jottings and bumping. Their minds moved in\r\ndifferent spheres. Marcia acted as practical factotum, and Horace\r\nlived either in his old world of abstract ideas or in a sort of\r\ntriumphantly earthy worship and adoration of his wife. She was a\r\ncontinual source of astonishment to him--the freshness and\r\noriginality of her mind, her dynamic, clear-headed energy, and\r\nher unfailing good humor.\r\n\r\nAnd Marcia\'s co-workers in the nine-o\'clock show, whither she had\r\ntransferred her talents, were impressed with her tremendous\r\npride in her husband\'s mental powers. Horace they knew only as a\r\nvery slim, tight-lipped, and immature-looking young man, who\r\nwaited every night to take her home.\r\n\r\n"Horace," said Marcia one evening when she met him as usual at\r\neleven, "you looked like a ghost standing there against the\r\nstreet lights. You losing weight?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head vaguely.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. They raised me to a hundred and thirty-five\r\ndollars to-day, and---"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Marcia severely. "You\'re killing yourself\r\nworking at night. You read those big books on economy---"\r\n\r\n"Economics," corrected Horace.\r\n\r\n"Well, you read \'em every night long after I\'m asleep. And you\'re\r\ngetting all stooped over like you were before we were married."\r\n\r\n"But, Marcia, I\'ve got to---"\r\n\r\n"No, you haven\'t dear. I guess I\'m running this shop for the\r\npresent, and I won\'t let my fella ruin his health and eyes. You\r\ngot to get some exercise."\r\n\r\n"I do. Every morning I---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know! But those dumb-bells of yours wouldn\'t give a\r\nconsumptive two degrees of fever. I mean real exercise. You\'ve\r\ngot to join a gymnasium. \'Member you told me you were such a\r\ntrick gymnast once that they tried to get you out for the team in\r\ncollege and they couldn\'t because you had a standing date with\r\nHerb Spencer?"\r\n\r\n"I used to enjoy it," mused Horace, "but it would take up too\r\nmuch time now."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Marcia. "I\'ll make a bargain with you. You join\r\na gym and I\'ll read one of those books from the brown row of\r\n\'em."\r\n\r\n"\'Pepys\' Diary\'? Why, that ought to be enjoyable. He\'s very\r\nlight."\r\n\r\n"Not for me--he isn\'t. It\'ll be like digesting plate glass. But\r\nyou been telling me how much it\'d broaden my lookout. Well, you\r\ngo to a gym three nights a week and I\'ll take one big dose of\r\nSammy."\r\n\r\nHorace hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Well---"\r\n\r\n"Come on, now! You do some giant swings for me and I\'ll chase\r\nsome culture for you."\r\n\r\nSo Horace finally consented, and all through a baking summer he\r\nspent three and sometimes four evenings a week experimenting on\r\nthe trapeze in Skipper\'s Gymnasium. And in August he admitted to\r\nMarcia that it made him capable of more mental work during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n"MENS SANA IN CORPORE SANO," he said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t believe in it," replied Marcia. "I tried one of those\r\npatent medicines once and they\'re all bunk. You stick to\r\ngymnastics."\r\n\r\nOne night in early September while he was going through one of\r\nhis contortions on the rings in the nearly deserted room he was\r\naddressed by a meditative fat man whom he had noticed watching\r\nhim for several nights.\r\n\r\n"Say, lad, do that stunt you were doin\' last night."\r\n\r\nHorace grinned at him from his perch.\r\n\r\n"I invented it," he said. "I got the idea from the fourth\r\nproposition of Euclid."\r\n\r\n"What circus he with?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead."\r\n\r\n"Well, he must of broke his neck doin\' that stunt. I set here\r\nlast night thinkin\' sure you was goin\' to break yours."\r\n\r\n"Like this!" said Horace, and swinging onto the trapeze he did\r\nhis stunt.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t it kill your neck an\' shoulder muscles?"\r\n\r\n"It did at first, but inside of a week I wrote the QUOD ERAT\r\nDEMONSTRANDUM on it."\r\n\r\n"Hm!"\r\n\r\nHorace swung idly on the trapeze.\r\n\r\n"Ever think of takin\' it up professionally?" asked the fat man.\r\n\r\n"Not I."\r\n\r\n"Good money in it if you\'re willin\' to do stunts like \'at an\' can\r\nget away with it."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s another," chirped Horace eagerly, and the fat man\'s mouth\r\ndropped suddenly agape as he watched this pink-jerseyed\r\nPrometheus again defy the gods and Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\nThe night following this encounter Horace got home from work to\r\nfind a rather pale Marcia stretched out on the sofa waiting for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I fainted twice to-day," she began without preliminaries.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Yep. You see baby\'s due in four months now. Doctor says I ought\r\nto have quit dancing two weeks ago."\r\n\r\nHorace sat down and thought it over.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of course," he said pensively--"I mean glad that we\'re\r\ngoing to have a baby. But this means a lot of expense."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got two hundred and fifty in the bank," said Marcia\r\nhopefully, "and two weeks\' pay coming."\r\n\r\nHorace computed quickly.\r\n\r\n"Inducing my salary, that\'ll give us nearly fourteen hundred for\r\nthe next six months."\r\n\r\nMarcia looked blue.\r\n\r\n"That all? Course I can get a job singing somewhere this month.\r\nAnd I can go to work again in March."\r\n\r\n"Of course nothing!" said Horace gruffly. "You\'ll stay right\r\nhere. Let\'s see now--there\'ll be doctor\'s bills and a nurse,\r\nbesides the maid: We\'ve got to have some more money."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Marcia wearily, "I don\'t know where it\'s coming\r\nfrom. It\'s up to the old head now. Shoulders is out of business."\r\n\r\nHorace rose and pulled on his coat.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got an idea," he answered. "I\'ll be right back."\r\n\r\nTen minutes later as he headed down the street toward Skipper\'s\r\nGymnasium he felt a placid wonder, quite unmixed with humor, at\r\nwhat he was going to do. How he would have gaped at himself a\r\nyear before! How every one would have gaped! But when you opened\r\nyour door at the rap of life you let in many things.\r\n\r\nThe gymnasium was brightly lit, and when his eyes became\r\naccustomed to the glare he found the meditative fat man seated on\r\na pile of canvas mats smoking a big cigar.\r\n\r\n"Say," began Horace directly, "were you in earnest last night\r\nwhen you said I could make money on my trapeze stunts?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," said the fat man in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve been thinking it over, and I believe I\'d like to try\r\nit. I could work at night and on Saturday afternoons--and\r\nregularly if the pay is high enough."\r\n\r\nThe fat men looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "Charlie Paulson\'s the man to see. He\'ll book\r\nyou inside of four days, once he sees you work out. He won\'t be\r\nin now, but I\'ll get hold of him for to-morrow night."\r\n\r\nThe fat man was as good as his word. Charlie Paulson arrived next\r\nnight and put in a wondrous hour watching the prodigy swap\r\nthrough the air in amazing parabolas, and on the night following\r\nhe brought two age men with him who looked as though they had\r\nbeen born smoking black cigars and talking about money in low,\r\npassionate voices. Then on the succeeding Saturday Horace\r\nTarbox\'s torso made its first professional appearance in a\r\ngymnastic exhibition at the Coleman Street Gardens. But though\r\nthe audience numbered nearly five thousand people, Horace felt no\r\nnervousness. From his childhood he had read papers to\r\naudiences--learned that trick of detaching himself.\r\n\r\n"Marcia," he said cheerfully later that same night, "I think\r\nwe\'re out of the woods. Paulson thinks he can get me an opening\r\nat the Hippodrome, and that means an all-winter engagement. The\r\nHippodrome you know, is a big---"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe I\'ve heard of it," interrupted Marcia, "but I\r\nwant to know about this stunt you\'re doing. It isn\'t any\r\nspectacular suicide, is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing," said Horace quietly. "But if you can think of an\r\nnicer way of a man killing himself than taking a risk for you,\r\nwhy that\'s the way I want to die."\r\n\r\nMarcia reached up and wound both arms tightly round his neck.\r\n\r\n"Kiss me," she whispered, "and call me \'dear heart.\' I love to\r\nhear you say \'dear heart.\' And bring me a book to read to-morrow.\r\nNo more Sam Pepys, but something trick and trashy. I\'ve been\r\nwild for something to do all day. I felt like writing letters,\r\nbut I didn\'t have anybody to write to."\r\n\r\n"Write to me," said Horace. "I\'ll read them."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could," breathed Marcia. "If I knew words enough I\r\ncould write you the longest love-letter in the world--and never\r\nget tired."\r\n\r\nBut after two more months Marcia grew very tired indeed, and for\r\na row of nights it was a very anxious, weary-looking young\r\nathlete who walked out before the Hippodrome crowd. Then there\r\nwere two days when his place was taken by a young man who wore\r\npale blue instead of white, and got very little applause. But\r\nafter the two days Horace appeared again, and those who sat close\r\nto the stage remarked an expression of beatific happiness on\r\nthat young acrobat\'s face even when he was twisting breathlessly\r\nin the air an the middle of his amazing and original shoulder\r\nswing. After that performance he laughed at the elevator man and\r\ndashed up the stairs to the flat five steps at a time--and then\r\ntiptoed very carefully into a quiet room.\r\n\r\n"Marcia," he whispered.\r\n\r\n"Hello!" She smiled up at him wanly. "Horace, there\'s something I\r\nwant you to do. Look in my top bureau drawer and you\'ll find a\r\nbig stack of paper. It\'s a book--sort of--Horace. I wrote it down\r\nin these last three months while I\'ve been laid up. I wish you\'d\r\ntake it to that Peter Boyce Wendell who put my letter in his\r\npaper.  He could tell you whether it\'d be a good book. I wrote it\r\njust the way I talk, just the way I wrote that letter to him.\r\nIt\'s just a story about a lot of things that happened to me. Will\r\nyou take it to him, Horace?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, darling."\r\n\r\nHe leaned over the bed until his head was beside her on the\r\npillow, and began stroking back her yellow hair.\r\n\r\n"Dearest Marcia," he said softly.\r\n\r\n"No," she murmured, "call me what I told you to call me."\r\n\r\n"Dear heart," he whispered passionately--"dearest heart."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll we call her?"\r\n\r\nThey rested a minute in happy, drowsy content, while Horace\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll call her Marcia Hume Tarbox," he said at length.\r\n\r\n"Why the Hume?"\r\n\r\n"Because he\'s the fellow who first introduced us."\r\n\r\n"That so?" she murmured, sleepily surprised. "I thought his name\r\nwas Moon."\r\n\r\nHer eyes dosed, and after a moment the slow lengthening surge of\r\nthe bedclothes over her breast showed that she was asleep.\r\n\r\nHorace tiptoed over to the bureau and opening the top drawer\r\nfound a heap of closely scrawled, lead-smeared pages. He looked\r\nat the first sheet:\r\n\r\n                    SANDRA PEPYS, SYNCOPATED\r\n                        BY MARCIA TARBOX\r\n\r\nHe smiled. So Samuel Pepys had made an impression on her after\r\nall. He turned a page and began to read. His smile deepened--he\r\nread on. Half an hour passed and he became aware that Marcia had\r\nwaked and was watching him from the bed.\r\n\r\n"Honey," came in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"What Marcia?"\r\n\r\n"Do you like it?"\r\n\r\nHorace coughed.\r\n\r\n"I seem to be reading on. It\'s bright."\r\n\r\n"Take it to Peter Boyce Wendell. Tell him you got the highest\r\nmarks in Princeton once and that you ought to know when a book\'s\r\ngood. Tell him this one\'s a world beater."\r\n\r\n"All right, Marcia," Horace said gently.\r\n\r\nHer eyes closed again and Horace crossing over kissed her\r\nforehead--stood there for a moment with a look of tender pity.\r\nThen he left the room.\r\n\r\nAll that night the sprawly writing on the pages, the constant\r\nmistakes in spelling and grammar, and the weird punctuation\r\ndanced before his eyes. He woke several times in the night, each\r\ntime full of a welling chaotic sympathy for this desire of\r\nMarcia\'s soul to express itself in words. To him there was\r\nsomething infinitely pathetic about it, and for the first time in\r\nmonths he began to turn over in his mind his own half-forgotten\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nHe had meant to write a series of books, to popularize the new\r\nrealism as Schopenhauer had popularized pessimism and William\r\nJames pragmatism.\r\n\r\nBut life hadn\'t come that way. Life took hold of people and\r\nforced them into flying rings. He laughed to think of that rap at\r\nhis door, the diaphanous shadow in Hume, Marcia\'s threatened\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s still me," he said aloud in wonder as he lay awake in\r\nthe darkness. "I\'m the man who sat in Berkeley with temerity to\r\nwonder if that rap would have had actual existence had my ear not\r\nbeen there to hear it. I\'m still that man. I could be\r\nelectrocuted for the crimes he committed.\r\n\r\n"Poor gauzy souls trying to express ourselves in something\r\ntangible. Marcia with her written book; I with my unwritten ones.\r\nTrying to choose our mediums and then taking what we get--and\r\nbeing glad."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n"Sandra Pepys, Syncopated," with an introduction by Peter Boyce\r\nWendell the columnist, appeared serially in JORDAN\'S MAGAZINE,\r\nand came out in book form in March. From its first published\r\ninstalment it attracted attention far and wide. A trite enough\r\nsubject--a girl from a small New Jersey town coming to New York\r\nto go on the stage--treated simply, with a peculiar vividness of\r\nphrasing and a haunting undertone of sadness in the very\r\ninadequacy of its vocabulary, it made an irresistible appeal.\r\n\r\nPeter Boyce Wendell, who happened at that time to be advocating\r\nthe enrichment of the American language by the immediate adoption\r\nof expressive vernacular words, stood as its sponsor and\r\nthundered his indorsement over the placid bromides of the\r\nconventional reviewers.\r\n\r\nMarcia received three hundred dollars an instalment for the\r\nserial publication, which came at an opportune time, for though\r\nHorace\'s monthly salary at the Hippodrome was now more than\r\nMarcia\'s had ever been, young Marcia was emitting shrill cries\r\nwhich they interpreted as a demand for country air. So early April\r\nfound them installed in a bungalow in Westchester County, with a\r\nplace for a lawn, a place for a garage, and a place for\r\neverything, including a sound-proof impregnable study, in which\r\nMarcia faithfully promised Mr. Jordan she would shut herself up\r\nwhen her daughter\'s demands began to be abated, and compose\r\nimmortally illiterate literature.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not half bad," thought Horace one night as he was on his\r\nway from the station to his house. He was considering several\r\nprospects that had opened up, a four months\' vaudeville offer in\r\nfive figures, a chance to go back to Princeton in charge of all\r\ngymnasium work. Odd! He had once intended to go back there in\r\ncharge of all philosophic work, and now he had not even been\r\nstirred by the arrival in New York of Anton Laurier, his old\r\nidol.\r\n\r\nThe gravel crunched raucously under his heel. He saw the lights\r\nof his sitting-room gleaming and noticed a big car standing in\r\nthe drive. Probably Mr. Jordan again, come to persuade Marcia to\r\nsettle down\' to work.\r\n\r\nShe had heard the sound of his approach and her form was\r\nsilhouetted against the lighted door as she came out to meet him.\r\n"There\'s some Frenchman here," she whispered nervously. "I\r\ncan\'t pronounce his name, but he sounds awful deep. You\'ll have\r\nto jaw with him."\r\n\r\n"What Frenchman?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t prove it by me. He drove up an hour ago with Mr.\r\nJordan, and said he wanted to meet Sandra Pepys, and all that sort\r\nof thing."\r\n\r\nTwo men rose from chairs as they went inside.\r\n\r\n"Hello Tarbox," said Jordan. "I\'ve just been bringing together\r\ntwo celebrities. I\'ve brought M\'sieur Laurier out with me.\r\nM\'sieur Laurier, let me present Mr. Tarbox, Mrs. Tarbox\'s\r\nhusband."\r\n\r\n"Not Anton Laurier!" exclaimed Horace.\r\n\r\n"But, yes. I must come. I have to come. I have read the book of\r\nMadame, and I have been charmed"--he fumbled in his pocket--"ah\r\nI have read of you too. In this newspaper which I read to-day it\r\nhas your name."\r\n\r\nHe finally produced a clipping from a magazine.\r\n\r\n"Read it!" he said eagerly. "It has about you too."\r\n\r\nHorace\'s eye skipped down the page.\r\n\r\n"A distinct contribution to American dialect literature," it\r\nsaid. "No attempt at literary tone; the book derives its very\r\nquality from this fact, as did \'Huckleberry Finn.\'"\r\n\r\nHorace\'s eyes caught a passage lower down; he became suddenly\r\naghast--read on hurriedly:\r\n\r\n"Marcia Tarbox\'s connection with the stage is not only as a\r\nspectator but as the wife of a performer. She was married last\r\nyear to Horace Tarbox, who every evening delights the children at\r\nthe Hippodrome with his wondrous flying performance. It is said\r\nthat the young couple have dubbed themselves Head and Shoulders,\r\nreferring doubtless to the fact that Mrs. Tarbox supplies the\r\nliterary and mental qualities, while the supple and agile\r\nshoulder of her husband contribute their share to the family\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Tarbox seems to merit that much-abused title--\'prodigy.\'\r\nOnly twenty---"\r\n\r\nHorace stopped reading, and with a very odd expression in his\r\neyes gazed intently at Anton Laurier.\r\n\r\n"I want to advise you--" he began hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"About raps. Don\'t answer them! Let them alone--have a padded\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cut-Glass Bowl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a rough stone age and a smooth stone age and a bronze\r\nage, and many years afterward a cut-glass age. In the cut-glass\r\nage, when young ladies had persuaded young men with long, curly\r\nmustaches to marry them, they sat down several months afterward\r\nand wrote thank-you notes for all sorts of cut-glass\r\npresents--punch-bowls, finger-bowls, dinner-glasses,\r\nwine-glasses, ice-cream dishes, bonbon dishes, decanters, and\r\nvases--for, though cut glass was nothing new in the nineties, it\r\nwas then especially busy reflecting the dazzling light of fashion\r\nfrom the Back Bay to the fastnesses of the Middle West.\r\n\r\nAfter the wedding the punch-bowls were arranged in the sideboard\r\nwith the big bowl in the centre; the glasses were set up in the\r\nchina-closet; the candlesticks were put at both ends of\r\nthings--and then the struggle for existence began. The bonbon\r\ndish lost its little handle and became a pin-tray upstairs; a\r\npromenading cat knocked the little bowl off the sideboard, and\r\nthe hired girl chipped the middle-sized one with the sugar-dish;\r\nthen the wine-glasses succumbed to leg fractures, and even the\r\ndinner-glasses disappeared one by one like the ten little\r\nniggers, the last one ending up, scarred and maimed as a\r\ntooth-brush holder among other shabby genteels on the bathroom\r\nshelf. But by the time all this had happened the cut-glass age\r\nwas over, anyway.\r\n\r\nIt was well past its first glory on the day the curious Mrs.\r\nRoger Fairboalt came to see the beautiful Mrs. Harold Piper.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the curious Mrs. Roger Fairboalt, "I LOVE your\r\nhouse. I think it\'s QUITE artistic."\r\n\r\n"I\'m SO glad," said the beautiful Mrs. Harold Piper, lights\r\nappearing in her young, dark eyes; "and you MUST come often. I\'m\r\nalmost ALWAYS alone in the afternoon."\r\n\r\nMrs. Fairboalt would have liked to remark that she didn\'t believe\r\nthis at all and couldn\'t see how she\'d be expected to--it was\r\nall over town that Mr. Freddy Gedney had been dropping in on Mrs.\r\nPiper five afternoons a week for the past six months. Mrs.\r\nFairboalt was at that ripe age where she distrusted all beautiful\r\nwomen---\r\n\r\n"I love the dining-room MOST," she said, "all that MARVELLOUS\r\nchina, and that HUGE cut-glass bowl."\r\n\r\nMrs. Piper laughed, so prettily that Mrs. Fairboalt\'s lingering\r\nreservations about the Freddy Gedney story quite vanished.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that big bowl!" Mrs. Piper\'s mouth forming the words was a\r\nvivid rose petal. "There\'s a story about that bowl---"\r\n\r\n"Oh---"\r\n\r\n"You remember young Carleton Canby? Well, he was very attentive\r\nat one time, and the night I told him I was going to marry\r\nHarold, seven years ago in ninety-two, he drew himself way up and\r\nsaid: \'Evylyn, I\'m going to give a present that\'s as hard as you\r\nare and as beautiful and as empty and as easy to see through.\'\r\nHe frightened me a little--his eyes were so black. I thought he\r\nwas going to deed me a haunted house or something that would\r\nexplode when you opened it. That bowl came, and of course it\'s\r\nbeautiful. Its diameter or circumference or something is two and\r\na half feet--or perhaps it\'s three and a half. Anyway, the\r\nsideboard is really too small for it; it sticks way out."\r\n\r\n"My DEAR, wasn\'t that ODD! And he left town about then didn\'t\r\nhe?" Mrs. Fairboalt was scribbling italicized notes on her\r\nmemory--"hard, beautiful, empty, and easy to see through."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he went West--or South--or somewhere," answered Mrs. Piper,\r\nradiating that divine vagueness that helps to lift beauty out of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fairboalt drew on her gloves, approving the effect of\r\nlargeness given by the open sweep from the spacious music-room\r\nthrough the library, disclosing a part of the dining-room beyond.\r\nIt was really the nicest smaller house in town, and Mrs. Piper\r\nhad talked of moving to a larger one on Devereaux Avenue. Harold\r\nPiper must be COINING money.\r\n\r\nAs she turned into the sidewalk under the gathering autumn dusk\r\nshe assumed that disapproving, faintly unpleasant expression that\r\nalmost all successful women of forty wear on the street.\r\n\r\nIf _I_ were Harold Piper, she thought, I\'d spend a LITTLE less\r\ntime on business and a little more time at home. Some FRIEND\r\nshould speak to him.\r\n\r\nBut if Mrs. Fairboalt had considered it a successful afternoon\r\nshe would have named it a triumph had she waited two minutes\r\nlonger. For while she was still a black receding figure a hundred\r\nyards down the street, a very good-looking distraught young man\r\nturned up the walk to the Piper house. Mrs. Piper answered the\r\ndoor-bell herself, and with a rather dismayed expression led him\r\nquickly into the library.\r\n\r\n"I had to see you," he began wildly; "your note played the devil\r\nwith me. Did Harold frighten you into this?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m through, Fred," she said slowly, and her lips had never\r\nlooked to him so much like tearings from a rose. "He came home\r\nlast night sick with it. Jessie Piper\'s sense of duty was to much\r\nfor her, so she went down to his office and told him. He was hurt\r\nand--oh, I can\'t help seeing it his way, Fred. He says we\'ve been\r\nclub gossip all summer and he didn\'t know it, and now he\r\nunderstands snatches of conversation he\'s caught and veiled hints\r\npeople have dropped about me. He\'s mighty angry, Fred, and he\r\nloves me and I love him--rather."\r\n\r\nGedney nodded slowly and half closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said "yes, my trouble\'s like yours. I can see other\r\npeople\'s points of view too plainly." His gray eyes met her dark\r\nones frankly. "The blessed thing\'s over. My God, Evylyn, I\'ve\r\nbeen sitting down at the office all day looking at the outside of\r\nyour letter, and looking at it and looking at it---"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to go, Fred," she said steadily, and the slight\r\nemphasis of hurry in her voice was a new thrust for him. "I gave\r\nhim my word of honor I wouldn\'t see you. I know just how far I\r\ncan go with Harold, and being here with you this evening is one\r\nof the things I can\'t do."\r\n\r\nThey were still standing, and as she spoke she made a little\r\nmovement toward the door. Gedney looked at her miserably, trying,\r\nhere at the end, to treasure up a last picture of her--and then\r\nsuddenly both of them were stiffened into marble at the sound of\r\nsteps on the walk outside. Instantly her arm reached out grasping\r\nthe lapel of his coat--half urged, half swung him through the\r\nbig door into the dark dining-room.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make him go up-stairs," she whispered close to his ear;\r\n"don\'t move till you hear him on the stairs. Then go out the\r\nfront way."\r\n\r\nThen he was alone listening as she greeted her husband in the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nHarold Piper was thirty-six, nine years older than his wife. He\r\nwas handsome--with marginal notes: these being eyes that were too\r\nclose together, and a certain woodenness when his face was in\r\nrepose. His attitude toward this Gedney matter was typical of all\r\nhis attitudes. He had told Evylyn that he considered the subject\r\nclosed and would never reproach her nor allude to it in any\r\nform; and he told himself that this was rather a big way of\r\nlooking at it--that she was not a little impressed. Yet, like all\r\nmen who are preoccupied with their own broadness, he was\r\nexceptionally narrow.\r\n\r\nHe greeted Evylyn with emphasized cordiality this evening.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to hurry and dress, Harold," she said eagerly;\r\n"we\'re going to the Bronsons\'."\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t take me long to dress, dear," and, his words trailing\r\noff, he walked on into the library. Evylyn\'s heart clattered\r\nloudly.\r\n\r\n"Harold---" she began, with a little catch in her voice, and\r\nfollowed him in. He was lighting a cigarette. "You\'ll have to\r\nhurry, Harold," she finished, standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n"Why?" he asked a trifle impatiently; "you\'re not dressed\r\nyourself yet, Evie."\r\n\r\nHe stretched out in a Morris chair and unfolded a newspaper. With\r\na sinking sensation Evylyn saw that this meant at least ten\r\nminutes--and Gedney was standing breathless in the next room.\r\nSupposing Harold decided that before he went upstairs he wanted a\r\ndrink from the decanter on the sideboard. Then it occurred to\r\nher to forestall this contingency by bringing him the decanter\r\nand a glass. She dreaded calling his attention to the dining-room\r\nin any way, but she couldn\'t risk the other chance.\r\n\r\nBut at the same moment Harold rose and, throwing his paper down,\r\ncame toward her.\r\n\r\n"Evie, dear," he said, bending and putting his arms about her, "I\r\nhope you\'re not thinking about last night---" She moved close to\r\nhim, trembling. "I know," he continued, "it was just an\r\nimprudent friendship on your part. We all make mistakes."\r\n\r\nEvylyn hardly heard him. She was wondering if by sheer clinging\r\nto him she could draw him out and up the stairs. She thought of\r\nplaying sick, asking to be carried up--unfortunately she knew he\r\nwould lay her on the couch and bring her whiskey.\r\n\r\nSuddenly her nervous tension moved up a last impossible notch.\r\nShe had heard a very faint but quite unmistakable creak from the\r\nfloor of the dining room. Fred was trying to get out the back\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThen her heart took a flying leap as a hollow ringing note like a\r\ngong echoed and re-echoed through the house. Gedney\'s arm had\r\nstruck the big cut-glass bowl.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that!" cried Harold. "Who\'s there?"\r\n\r\nShe clung to him but he broke away, and the room seemed to crash\r\nabout her ears. She heard the pantry-door swing open, a scuffle,\r\nthe rattle of a tin pan, and in wild despair she rushed into the\r\nkitchen and pulled up the gas. Her husband\'s arm slowly unwound\r\nfrom Gedney\'s neck, and he stood there very still, first in\r\namazement, then with pain dawning in his face.\r\n\r\n"My golly!" he said in bewilderment, and then repeated: "My\r\nGOLLY!"\r\n\r\nHe turned as if to jump again at Gedney, stopped, his muscles\r\nvisibly relaxed, and he gave a bitter little laugh.\r\n\r\n"You people--you people---" Evylyn\'s arms were around him and her\r\neyes were pleading with him frantically, but he pushed her away\r\nand sank dazed into a kitchen chair, his face like porcelain.\r\n"You\'ve been doing things to me, Evylyn. Why, you little devil!\r\nYou little DEVIL!"\r\n\r\nShe had never felt so sorry for him; she had never loved him so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t her fault," said Gedney rather humbly. "I just came."\r\nBut Piper shook his head, and his expression when he stared up\r\nwas as if some physical accident had jarred his mind into a\r\ntemporary inability to function. His eyes, grown suddenly\r\npitiful, struck a deep, unsounded chord in Evylyn--and\r\nsimultaneously a furious anger surged in her. She felt her\r\neyelids burning; she stamped her foot violently; her hands\r\nscurried nervously over the table as if searching for a weapon,\r\nand then she flung herself wildly at Gedney.\r\n\r\n"Get out!" she screamed, dark eves blazing, little fists beating\r\nhelplessly on his outstretched arm. "You did this! Get out of\r\nhere--get out--get OUT! GET OUT!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning Mrs. Harold Piper at thirty-five, opinion was\r\ndivided--women said she was still handsome; men said she was\r\npretty no longer. And this was probably because the qualities in\r\nher beauty that women had feared and men had followed had\r\nvanished. Her eyes were still as large and as dark and as sad,\r\nbut the mystery had departed; their sadness was no longer\r\neternal, only human, and she had developed a habit, when she was\r\nstartled or annoyed, of twitching her brows together and blinking\r\nseveral times. Her mouth also had lost: the red had receded and\r\nthe faint down-turning of its corners when she smiled, that had\r\nadded to the sadness of the eyes and been vaguely mocking and\r\nbeautiful, was quite gone. When she smiled now the corners of her\r\nlips turned up. Back in the days when she revelled in her own\r\nbeauty Evylyn had enjoyed that smile of hers--she had accentuated\r\nit. When she stopped accentuating it, it faded out and the last\r\nof her mystery with it.\r\n\r\nEvylyn had ceased accentuating her smile within a month after the\r\nFreddy Gedney affair. Externally things had gone an very much as\r\nthey had before. But in those few minutes during which she had\r\ndiscovered how much she loved her husband, Evylyn had realized how\r\nindelibly she had hurt him. For a month she struggled against\r\naching silences, wild reproaches and accusations--she pled with\r\nhim, made quiet, pitiful little love to him, and he laughed at\r\nher bitterly--and then she, too, slipped gradually into silence\r\nand a shadowy, impenetrable barrier dropped between them. The\r\nsurge of love that had risen in her she lavished on Donald, her\r\nlittle boy, realizing him almost wonderingly as a part of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe next year a piling up of mutual interests and\r\nresponsibilities and some stray flicker from the past brought\r\nhusband and wife together again--but after a rather pathetic\r\nflood of passion Evylyn realized that her great opportunity was\r\ngone. There simply wasn\'t anything left. She might have been\r\nyouth and love for both--but that time of silence had slowly\r\ndried up the springs of affection and her own desire to drink\r\nagain of them was dead.\r\n\r\nShe began for the first time to seek women friends, to prefer\r\nbooks she had read before, to sew a little where she could watch\r\nher two children to whom she was devoted. She worried about\r\nlittle things--if she saw crumbs on the dinner-table her mind\r\ndrifted off the conversation: she was receding gradually into\r\nmiddle age.\r\n\r\nHer thirty-fifth birthday had been an exceptionally busy one, for\r\nthey were entertaining on short notice that night, as she stood\r\nin her bedroom window in the late afternoon she discovered that\r\nshe was quite tired. Ten years before she would have lain down\r\nand slept, but now she had a feeling that things needed watching:\r\nmaids were cleaning down-stairs, bric-\xe0-brac was all over the\r\nfloor, and there were sure to be grocery-men that had to be\r\ntalked to imperatively--and then there was a letter to write\r\nDonald, who was fourteen and in his first year away at school.\r\n\r\nShe had nearly decided to lie down, nevertheless, when she heard\r\na sudden familiar signal from little Julie down-stairs. She\r\ncompressed her lips, her brows twitched together, and she\r\nblinked.\r\n\r\n"Julie!" she called.\r\n\r\n"Ah-h-h-ow!" prolonged Julie plaintively. Then the voice of\r\nHilda, the second maid, floated up the stairs.\r\n\r\n"She cut herself a little, Mis\' Piper."\r\n\r\nEvylyn flew to her sewing-basket, rummaged until she found a torn\r\nhandkerchief, and hurried downstairs. In a moment Julie was\r\ncrying in her arms as she searched for the cut, faint,\r\ndisparaging evidences of which appeared on Julie\'s dress.\r\n\r\n"My THU-umb!" explained Julie. "Oh-h-h-h, t\'urts."\r\n\r\n"It was the bowl here, the he one," said Hilda apologetically.\r\n"It was waitin\' on the floor while I polished the sideboard, and\r\nJulie come along an\' went to foolin\' with it. She yust scratch\r\nherself."\r\n\r\nEvylyn frowned heavily at Hilda, and twisting Julie decisively in\r\nher lap, began tearing strips of the handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"Now--let\'s see it, dear."\r\n\r\nJulie held it up and Evelyn pounced.\r\n\r\n"There!"\r\n\r\nJulie surveyed her swathed thumb doubtfully. She crooked it; it\r\nwaggled. A pleased, interested look appeared in her tear-stained\r\nface. She sniffled and waggled it again.\r\n\r\n"You PRECIOUS!" cried Evylyn and kissed her, but before she left\r\nthe room she levelled another frown at Hilda. Careless! Servants\r\nall that way nowadays. If she could get a good Irishwoman--but\r\nyou couldn\'t any more--and these Swedes---\r\n\r\nAt five o\'clock Harold arrived and, coming up to her room,\r\nthreatened in a suspiciously jovial tone to kiss her thirty-five\r\ntimes for her birthday. Evylyn resisted.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been drinking," she said shortly, and then added\r\nqualitatively, "a little. You know I loathe the smell of it."\r\n\r\n"Evie," he said after a pause, seating himself in a chair by the\r\nwindow, "I can tell you something now. I guess you\'ve known\r\nthings haven\'t beep going quite right down-town."\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the window combing her hair, but at these\r\nwords she turned and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"How do you mean? You\'ve always said there was room for more than\r\none wholesale hardware house in town." Her voice expressed some\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n"There WAS," said Harold significantly, "but this Clarence Ahearn\r\nis a smart man."\r\n\r\n"I was surprised when you said he was coming to dinner."\r\n\r\n"Evie," he went on, with another slap at his knee, "after January\r\nfirst \'The Clarence Ahearn Company\' becomes \'The Ahearn, Piper\r\nCompany\'--and \'Piper Brothers\' as a company ceases to\r\nexist."\r\n\r\nEvylyn was startled. The sound of his name in second place was\r\nsomehow hostile to her; still he appeared jubilant.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand, Harold."\r\n\r\n"Well, Evie, Ahearn has been fooling around with Marx. If those\r\ntwo had combined we\'d have been the little fellow, struggling\r\nalong, picking up smaller orders, hanging back on risks. It\'s a\r\nquestion of capital, Evie, and \'Ahearn and Marx\' would have had\r\nthe business just like \'Ahearn and Piper\' is going to now." He\r\npaused and coughed and a little cloud of whiskey floated up to\r\nher nostrils. "Tell you the truth, Evie, I\'ve suspected that\r\nAhearn\'s wife had something to do with it. Ambitious little lady,\r\nI\'m told. Guess she knew the Marxes couldn\'t help her much\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Is she--common?" asked Evie.\r\n\r\n"Never met her, I\'m sure--but I don\'t doubt it. Clarence Ahearn\'s\r\nname\'s been up at the Country Club five months--no action\r\ntaken." He waved his hand disparagingly. "Ahearn and I had lunch\r\ntogether to-day and just about clinched it, so I thought it\'d be\r\nnice to have him and his wife up to-night--just have nine, mostly\r\nfamily. After all, it\'s a big thing for me, and of course we\'ll\r\nhave to see something of them, Evie."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Evie thoughtfully, "I suppose we will."\r\n\r\nEvylyn was not disturbed over the social end of it--but the idea\r\nof "Piper Brothers" becoming "The Ahearn, Piper Company" startled\r\nher. It seemed like going down in the world.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, as she began to dress for dinner, she heard\r\nhis voice from down-stairs.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Evie, come down!"\r\n\r\nShe went out into the hall and called over the banister:\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to help me make some of that punch before dinner."\r\n\r\nHurriedly rehooking her dress, she descended the stairs and found\r\nhim grouping the essentials on the dining-room table. She went\r\nto the sideboard and, lifting one of the bowls, carried it\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," he protested, "let\'s use the big one. There\'ll be\r\nAhearn and his wife and you and I and Milton, that\'s five, and\r\nTom and Jessie, that\'s seven: and your sister and Joe Ambler,\r\nthat\'s nine. You don\'t know how quick that stuff goes when YOU\r\nmake it."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll use this bowl," she insisted. "It\'ll hold plenty. You know\r\nhow Tom is."\r\n\r\nTom Lowrie, husband to Jessie, Harold\'s first cousin, was rather\r\ninclined to finish anything in a liquid way that he began.\r\n\r\nHarold shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be foolish. That one holds only about three quarts and\r\nthere\'s nine of us, and the servants\'ll want some--and it isn\'t\r\nstrong punch. It\'s  so much more cheerful to have a lot, Evie; we\r\ndon\'t have to drink all of it."\r\n\r\n"I say the small one."\r\n\r\nAgain he shook his head obstinately.\r\n\r\n"No; be reasonable."\r\n\r\n"I AM reasonable," she said shortly. "I don\'t want any drunken\r\nmen in the house."\r\n\r\n"Who said you did?"\r\n\r\n"Then use the small bowl."\r\n\r\n"Now, Evie---"\r\n\r\nHe grasped the smaller bowl to lift it back. Instantly her hands\r\nwere on it, holding it down. There was a momentary struggle, and\r\nthen, with a little exasperated grunt, he raised his side,\r\nslipped it from her fingers, and carried it to the sideboard.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him and tried to make her expression contemptuous,\r\nbut he only laughed. Acknowledging her defeat but disclaiming all\r\nfuture interest in the punch, she left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven-thirty, her cheeks glowing and her high-piled hair\r\ngleaming with a suspicion of brilliantine, Evylyn descended the\r\nstairs. Mrs. Ahearn, a little woman concealing a slight\r\nnervousness under red hair and an extreme Empire gown, greeted\r\nher volubly. Evelyn disliked her on the spot, but the husband she\r\nrather approved of. He had keen blue eyes and a natural gift of\r\npleasing people that might have made him, socially, had he not so\r\nobviously committed the blunder of marrying too early in his\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to know Piper\'s wife," he said simply. "It looks as\r\nthough your husband and I are going to see a lot of each other in\r\nthe future."\r\n\r\nShe bowed, smiled graciously, and turned to greet the others:\r\nMilton Piper, Harold\'s quiet, unassertive younger brother; the\r\ntwo Lowries, Jessie and Tom; Irene, her own unmarried sister; and\r\nfinally Joe Ambler, a confirmed bachelor and Irene\'s perennial\r\nbeau.\r\n\r\nHarold led the way into dinner.\r\n\r\n"We\'re having a punch evening," he announced jovially--Evylyn saw\r\nthat he had already sampled his concoction--"so there won\'t be\r\nany cocktails except the punch. It\'s m\' wife\'s greatest\r\nachievement, Mrs. Ahearn; she\'ll give you the recipe if you want\r\nit; but owing to a slight"--he caught his wife\'s eye and paused\r\n--"to a slight indisposition; I\'m responsible for this batch.\r\nHere\'s how!"\r\n\r\nAll through dinner there was punch, and Evylyn, noticing that\r\nAhearn and Milton Piper and all the women were shaking their\r\nheads negatively at the maid, knew she had been right about the\r\nbowl; it was still half full. She resolved to caution Harold\r\ndirectly afterward, but when the women left the table Mrs. Ahearn\r\ncornered her, and she found herself talking cities and\r\ndressmakers with a polite show of interest.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve moved around a lot," chattered Mrs. Ahearn, her red head\r\nnodding violently. "Oh, yes, we\'ve never stayed so long in a town\r\nbefore--but I do hope we\'re here for good. I like it here; don\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, I\'ve always lived here, so, naturally---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s true," said Mrs. Ahearn and laughed. Clarence always\r\nused to tell me he had to have a wife he could come home to and\r\nsay: "Well, we\'re going to Chicago to-morrow to live, so pack\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"I got so I never expected to live ANYwhere." She laughed her\r\nlittle laugh again; Evylyn suspected that it was her society\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Your husband is a very able man, I imagine."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," Mrs. Ahearn assured her eagerly. "He\'s brainy,\r\nClarence is. Ideas and enthusiasm, you know. Finds out what he\r\nwants and then goes and gets it."\r\n\r\nEvylyn nodded. She was wondering if the men were still drinking\r\npunch back in the dining-room. Mrs. Ahearn\'s history kept\r\nunfolding jerkily, but Evylyn had ceased to listen. The first\r\nodor of massed cigars began to drift in. It wasn\'t really a large\r\nhouse, she reflected; on an evening like this the library\r\nsometimes grew blue with smoke, and next day one had to leave the\r\nwindows open for hours to air the heavy staleness out of the\r\ncurtains. Perhaps this partnership might . . . she began to\r\nspeculate on a new house . . .\r\n\r\nMrs. Ahearn\'s voice drifted in on her:\r\n\r\n"I really would like the recipe if you have it written down\r\nsomewhere---"\r\n\r\nThen there was a sound of chairs in the dining-room and the men\r\nstrolled in. Evylyn saw at once that her worst fears were\r\nrealized. Harold\'s face was flushed and his words ran together at\r\nthe ends of sentences, while Tom Lowrie lurched when he walked\r\nand narrowly missed Irene\'s lap when he tried to sink onto the\r\ncouch beside her. He sat there blinking dazedly at the company.\r\nEvylyn found herself blinking back at him, but she saw no humor in\r\nit. Joe Ambler was smiling contentedly and purring on his cigar.\r\nOnly Ahearn and Milton Piper seemed unaffected.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pretty fine town, Ahearn," said Ambler, "you\'ll find\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve found it so," said Ahearn pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"You find it more, Ahearn," said Harold, nodding emphatically "\'f\r\nI\'ve an\'thin\' do \'th it."\r\n\r\nHe soared into a eulogy of the city, and Evylyn wondered\r\nuncomfortably if it bored every one as it bored her. Apparently\r\nnot. They were all listening attentively. Evylyn broke in at the\r\nfirst gap.\r\n\r\n"Where\'ve you been living, Mr. Ahearn?" she asked interestedly.\r\nThen she remembered that Mrs. Ahearn had told her, but it didn\'t\r\nmatter. Harold mustn\'t talk so much. He was such an ASS when he\'d\r\nbeen drinking. But he plopped directly back in.\r\n\r\n"Tell you, Ahearn. Firs\' you wanna get a house up here on the\r\nhill. Get Stearne house or Ridgeway house. Wanna have it so\r\npeople say: \'There\'s Ahearn house.\' Solid, you know, tha\'s effec\'\r\nit gives."\r\n\r\nEvylyn flushed. This didn\'t sound right at all. Still Ahearn\r\ndidn\'t seem to notice anything amiss, only nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n"Have you been looking---" But her words trailed off unheard as\r\nHarold\'s voice boomed on.\r\n\r\n"Get house--tha\'s start. Then you get know people. Snobbish town\r\nfirst toward outsider, but not long--after know you. People like\r\nyou"--he indicated Ahearn and his wife with a sweeping\r\ngesture--"all right. Cordial as an\'thin\' once get by first\r\nbarrer-bar-barrer--" He swallowed, and then said "barrier,"\r\nrepeated it masterfully.\r\n\r\nEvylyn looked appealingly at her brother-in-law, but before he\r\ncould intercede a thick mumble had come crowding out of Tom\r\nLowrie, hindered by the dead cigar which he gripped firmly with\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\n"Huma uma ho huma ahdy um---"\r\n\r\n"What?" demanded Harold earnestly.\r\n\r\nResignedly and with difficulty Tom removed the cigar--that is, he\r\nremoved part of it, and then blew the remainder with a WHUT\r\nsound across the room, where it landed liquidly and limply in\r\nMrs. Ahearn\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon," he mumbled, and rose with the vague intention of\r\ngoing after it. Milton\'s hand on his coat collapsed him in time,\r\nand Mrs. Ahearn not ungracefully flounced the tobacco from her\r\nskirt to the floor, never once looking at it.\r\n\r\n"I was sayin\'," continued Tom thickly, "\'fore \'at happened,"--he\r\nwaved his hand apologetically toward Mrs. Ahearn--"I was sayin\' I\r\nheard all truth that Country Club matter."\r\n\r\nMilton leaned and whispered something to him.\r\n\r\n"Lemme \'lone," he said petulantly; "know what I\'m doin\'.  \'Ats\r\nwhat they came for."\r\n\r\nEvylyn sat there in a panic, trying to make her mouth form words.\r\nShe saw her sister\'s sardonic expression and Mrs. Ahearn\'s face\r\nturning a vivid red. Ahearn was looking down at his watch-chain,\r\nfingering it.\r\n\r\n"I heard who\'s been keepin\' y\' out, an\' he\'s not a bit better\'n\r\nyou. I can fix whole damn thing up. Would\'ve before, but I didn\'t\r\nknow you. Harol\' tol\' me you felt bad about the thing---"\r\n\r\nMilton Piper rose suddenly and awkwardly to his feet. In a second\r\nevery one was standing tensely and Milton was saying something\r\nvery hurriedly about having to go early, and the Ahearns were\r\nlistening with eager intentness. Then Mrs. Ahearn swallowed and\r\nturned with a forced smile toward Jessie. Evylyn saw Tom lurch\r\nforward and put his hand on Ahearns shoulder--and suddenly she\r\nwas listening to a new, anxious voice at her elbow, and, turning,\r\nfound Hilda, the second maid.\r\n\r\n"Please, Mis\' Piper, I tank Yulie got her hand poisoned. It\'s all\r\nswole up and her cheeks is hot and she\'s moanin\' an\'\r\ngroanin\'---"\r\n\r\n"Julie is?" Evylyn asked sharply. The party suddenly receded. She\r\nturned quickly, sought with her eyes for Mrs. Ahearn, slipped\r\ntoward her.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll excuse me, Mrs.--" She had momentarily forgotten the\r\nname, but she went right on:  "My little girl\'s been taken sick.\r\nI\'ll be down when I can." She turned and ran quickly up the\r\nstairs, retaining a confused picture of rays of cigar smoke and a\r\nloud discussion in the centre of the room that seemed to be\r\ndeveloping into an argument.\r\n\r\nSwitching on the light in the nursery, she found Julie tossing\r\nfeverishly and giving out odd little cries. She put her hand\r\nagainst the cheeks. They were burning. With an exclamation she\r\nfollowed the arm down under the cover until she found the hand.\r\nHilda was right. The whole thumb was swollen to the wrist and in\r\nthe centre was a little inflamed sore. Blood-poisoning! her mind\r\ncried in terror. The bandage had come off the cut and she\'d\r\ngotten something in it. She\'d cut it at three o\'clock--it was now\r\nnearly eleven. Eight hours. Blood-poisoning couldn\'t possibly\r\ndevelop so soon.\r\n\r\nShe rushed to the \'phone.\r\n\r\nDoctor Martin across the street was out. Doctor Foulke, their\r\nfamily physician, didn\'t answer. She racked her brains and in\r\ndesperation called her throat specialist, and bit her lip\r\nfuriously while he looked up the numbers of two physicians.\r\nDuring that interminable moment she thought she heard loud voices\r\ndown-stairs--but she seemed to be in another world now. After\r\nfifteen minutes she located a physician who sounded angry and\r\nsulky at being called out of bed. She ran back to the nursery\r\nand, looking at the hand, found it was somewhat more\r\nswollen.\r\n\r\n"Oh, God!" she cried, and kneeling beside the bed began smoothing\r\nback Julie\'s hair over and over. With a vague idea of getting\r\nsome hot water, she rose and stared toward the door, but the lace\r\nof her dress caught in the bed-rail and she fell forward on her\r\nhands and knees. She struggled up and jerked frantically at the\r\nlace. The bed moved and Julie groaned. Then more quietly but with\r\nsuddenly fumbling fingers she found the pleat in front, tore the\r\nwhole pannier completely off, and rushed from the room.\r\n\r\nOut in the hall she heard a single loud, insistent voice, but as\r\nshe reached the head of the stairs it ceased and an outer door\r\nbanged.\r\n\r\nThe music-room came into view. Only Harold and Milton were there,\r\nthe former leaning against a chair, his face very pale, his\r\ncollar open, and his mouth moving loosely.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nMilton looked at her anxiously.\r\n\r\n"There was a little trouble---"\r\n\r\nThen Harold saw her and, straightening up with an effort, began\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n"Sult m\'own cousin m\'own house. God damn common nouveau rish.\r\n\'Sult m\'own cousin---"\r\n\r\n"Tom had trouble with Ahearn and Harold interfered," said Milton.\r\n"My Lord Milton," cried Evylyn, "couldn\'t you have done\r\nsomething?"\r\n\r\n"I tried; I---"\r\n\r\n"Julie\'s sick," she interrupted; "she\'s poisoned herself. Get him\r\nto bed if you can."\r\n\r\nHarold looked up.\r\n\r\n"Julie sick?"\r\n\r\nPaying no attention, Evylyn brushed by through the dining-room,\r\ncatching sight, with a burst of horror, of the big punch-bowl\r\nstill on the table, the liquid from melted ice in its bottom. She\r\nheard steps on the front stairs--it was Milton helping Harold\r\nup--and then a mumble: "Why, Julie\'s a\'righ\'."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let him go into the nursery!" she shouted.\r\n\r\nThe hours blurred into a nightmare. The doctor arrived just\r\nbefore midnight and within a half-hour had lanced the wound. He\r\nleft at two after giving her the addresses of two nurses to call\r\nup and promising to return at half past six. It was\r\nblood-poisoning.\r\n\r\nAt four, leaving Hilda by the bedside, she went to her room, and\r\nslipping with a shudder out of her evening dress, kicked it into a\r\ncorner. She put on a house dress and returned to the nursery\r\nwhile Hilda went to make coffee.\r\n\r\nNot until noon could she bring herself to look into Harold\'s\r\nroom, but when she did it was to find him awake and staring very\r\nmiserably at the ceiling. He turned blood-shot hollow eyes upon\r\nher. For a minute she hated him, couldn\'t speak. A husky voice\r\ncame from the bed.\r\n\r\n"What time is it?"\r\n\r\n"Noon."\r\n\r\n"I made a damn fool---"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter," she said sharply. "Julie\'s got\r\nblood-poisoning. They may"--she choked over the words--"they\r\nthink she\'ll have to lose her hand."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"She cut herself on that--that bowl."\r\n\r\n"Last night?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, what does it matter?" see cried; "she\'s got blood-poisoning.\r\nCan\'t you hear?" He looked at her bewildered--sat half-way up\r\nin bed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get dressed," he said.\r\n\r\nHer anger subsided and a great wave of weariness and pity for him\r\nrolled over her. After all, it was his trouble, too.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered listlessly, "I suppose you\'d better."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Evylyn\'s beauty had hesitated an her early thirties it came to\r\nan abrupt decision just afterward and completely left her. A\r\ntentative outlay of wrinkles on her face suddenly deepened and\r\nflesh collected rapidly on her legs and hips and arms. Her\r\nmannerism of drawing her brows together had become an\r\nexpression--it was habitual when she was reading or speaking and\r\neven while she slept. She was forty-six.\r\n\r\nAs in most families whose fortunes have gone down rather than up,\r\nshe and Harold had drifted into a colorless antagonism. In\r\nrepose they looked at each other with the toleration they might\r\nhave felt for broken old chairs; Evylyn worried a little when he\r\nwas sick and did her best to be cheerful under the wearying\r\ndepression of living with a disappointed man.\r\n\r\nFamily bridge was over for the evening and she sighed with\r\nrelief. She had made more mistakes than usual this evening and\r\nshe didn\'t care. Irene shouldn\'t have made that remark about the\r\ninfantry being particularly dangerous. There had been no letter\r\nfor three weeks now, and, while this was nothing out of the\r\nordinary, it never failed to make her nervous; naturally she\r\nhadn\'t known how many clubs were out.\r\n\r\nHarold had gone up-stairs, so she stepped out on the porch for a\r\nbreath of fresh air. There was a bright glamour of moonlight\r\ndiffusing on the sidewalks and lawns, and with a little half\r\nyawn, half laugh, she remembered one long moonlight affair of her\r\nyouth. It was astonishing to think that life had once been the\r\nsum of her current love-affairs. It was now the sum of her\r\ncurrent problems.\r\n\r\nThere was the problem of Julie--Julie was thirteen, and lately\r\nshe was growing more and more sensitive about her deformity and\r\npreferred to stay always in her room reading. A few years before\r\nshe had been frightened at the idea of going to school, and\r\nEvylyn could not bring herself to send her, so she grew up in her\r\nmother\'s shadow, a pitiful little figure with the artificial\r\nhand that she made no attempt to use but kept forlornly in her\r\npocket. Lately she had been taking lessons in using it because\r\nEvylyn had feared she would cease to lift the arm altogether, but\r\nafter the lessons, unless she made a move with it in listless\r\nobedience to her mother, the little hand would creep back to the\r\npocket of her dress. For a while her dresses were made without\r\npockets, but Julie had moped around the house so miserably at a\r\nloss all one month that Evylyn weakened and never tried the\r\nexperiment again.\r\n\r\nThe problem of Donald had been different from the start.  She had\r\nattempted vainly to keep him near her as she had tried to teach\r\nJulie to lean less on her--lately the problem of Donald had been\r\nsnatched out of her hands; his division had been abroad for three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nShe yawned again--life was a thing for youth.  What a happy youth\r\nshe must have had!  She remembered her pony, Bijou, and the trip\r\nto Europe with her mother when she was eighteen---\r\n\r\n"Very, very complicated," she said aloud and severely to the\r\nmoon, and, stepping inside, was about to close the door when she\r\nheard a noise in the library and started.\r\n\r\nIt was Martha, the middle-aged servant: they kept only one now.\r\n\r\n"Why, Martha!" she said in surprise.\r\n\r\nMartha turned quickly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought you was up-stairs.  I was jist---"\r\n\r\n"Is anything the matter?"\r\n\r\nMartha hesitated.\r\n\r\n"No; I---"  She stood there fidgeting.  "It was a letter, Mrs.\r\nPiper, that I put somewhere.\r\n\r\n"A letter?  Your own letter?" asked Evylyn.\r\n\r\n"No, it was to you. \'Twas this afternoon, Mrs. Piper, in the last\r\nmail. The postman give it to me and then the back door-bell\r\nrang. I had it in my hand, so I must have stuck it somewhere. I\r\nthought I\'d just slip in now and find it."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a letter?  From Mr. Donald?"\r\n\r\n"No, it was an advertisement, maybe, or a business letter. It was\r\na long narrow one, I remember."\r\n\r\nThey began a search through the music-room, looking on trays and\r\nmantelpieces, and then through the library, feeling on the tops\r\nof rows of books. Martha paused in despair.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think where. I went straight to the kitchen. The\r\ndining-room, maybe." She started hopefully for the dining-room,\r\nbut turned suddenly at the sound of a gasp behind her. Evylyn had\r\nsat down heavily in a Morris chair, her brows drawn very close\r\ntogether eyes blanking furiously.\r\n\r\n"Are you sick?"\r\n\r\nFor a minute there was no answer. Evylyn sat there very still and\r\nMartha could see the very quick rise and fall of her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Are you sick?" she repeated.\r\n\r\n"No," said Evylyn slowly, "but I know where the letter is. Go\r\n\'way, Martha. I know."\r\n\r\nWonderingly, Martha withdrew, and still Evylyn sat there, only\r\nthe muscles around her eyes moving--contracting and relaxing and\r\ncontracting again. She knew now where the letter was--she knew\r\nas well as if she had put it there herself. And she felt\r\ninstinctively and unquestionably what the letter was. It was long\r\nand narrow like an advertisement, but up in the corner in large\r\nletters it said "War Department" and, in smaller letters below,\r\n"Official Business." She knew it lay there in the big bowl with\r\nher name in ink on the outside and her soul\'s death within.\r\n\r\nRising uncertainly, she walked toward the dining-room, feeling\r\nher way along the bookcases and through the doorway. After a\r\nmoment she found the light and switched it on.\r\n\r\nThere was the bowl, reflecting the electric light in crimson\r\nsquares edged with black and yellow squares edged with blue,\r\nponderous and glittering, grotesquely and triumphantly ominous.\r\nShe took a step forward and paused again; another step and she\r\nwould see over the top and into the inside--another step and she\r\nwould see an edge of white--another step--her hands fell on the\r\nrough, cold surface--\r\n\r\nIn a moment she was tearing it open, fumbling with an obstinate\r\nfold, holding it before her while the typewritten page glared out\r\nand struck at her. Then it fluttered like a bird to the floor.\r\nThe house that had seemed whirring, buzzing a moment since, was\r\nsuddenly very quiet; a breath of air crept in through the open\r\nfront door carrying the noise of a passing motor; she heard faint\r\nsounds from upstairs and then a grinding racket in the pipe\r\nbehind the bookcases-her husband turning of a water-tap---\r\n\r\nAnd in that instant it was as if this were not, after all,\r\nDonald\'s hour except in so far as he was a marker in the\r\ninsidious contest that had gone on in sudden surges and long,\r\nlistless interludes between Evylyn and this cold, malignant thing\r\nof beauty, a gift of enmity from a man whose face she had long\r\nsince forgotten.  With its massive, brooding passivity it lay\r\nthere in the centre of her house as it had lain for years,\r\nthrowing out the ice-like beams of a thousand eyes, perverse\r\nglitterings merging each into each, never aging, never changing.\r\n\r\nEvylyn sat down on the edge of the table and stared at it\r\nfascinated. It seemed to be smiling now, a very cruel smile, as\r\nif to say:\r\n\r\n"You see, this time I didn\'t have to hurt you directly. I didn\'t\r\nbother. You know it was I who took your son away. You know how\r\ncold I am and how hard and how beautiful, because once you were\r\njust as cold and hard and beautiful."\r\n\r\nThe bowl seemed suddenly to turn itself over and then to distend\r\nand swell until it became a great canopy that glittered and\r\ntrembled over the room, over the house, and, as the walls melted\r\nslowly into mist, Evylyn saw that it was still moving out, out\r\nand far away from her, shutting off far horizons and suns and\r\nmoons and stars except as inky blots seen faintly through it. And\r\nunder it walked all the people, and the light that came through\r\nto them was refracted and twisted until shadow seamed light and\r\nlight seemed shadow--until the whole panoply of the world became\r\nchanged and distorted under the twinkling heaven of\r\nthe bowl.\r\n\r\nThen there came a far-away, booming voice like a low, clear bell.\r\nIt came from the centre of the bowl and down the great sides to\r\nthe ground and then bounced toward her eagerly.\r\n\r\n"You see, I am fate," it shouted, "and stronger than your puny\r\nplans; and I am how-things-turn-out and I am different from your\r\nlittle dreams, and I am the flight of time and the end of beauty\r\nand unfulfilled desire; all the accidents and imperceptions and\r\nthe little minutes that shape the crucial hours are mine. I am\r\nthe exception that proves no rules, the limits of your control,\r\nthe condiment in the dish of life."\r\n\r\nThe booming sound stopped; the echoes rolled away over the wide\r\nland to the edge of the bowl that bounded the world and up the\r\ngreat sides and back to the centre where they hummed for a moment\r\nand died. Then the great walls began slowly to bear down upon\r\nher, growing smaller and smaller, coming closer and closer as if\r\nto crush her; and as she clinched her hands and waited for the\r\nswift bruise of the cold glass, the bowl gave a sudden wrench and\r\nturned over--and lay there on the side-board, shining and\r\ninscrutable, reflecting in a hundred prisms, myriad, many-colored\r\nglints and gleams and crossings and interlaces of light.\r\n\r\nThe cold wind blew in again through to front door, and with a\r\ndesperate, frantic energy Evylyn stretched both her arms around\r\nthe bowl. She must be quick--she must be strong. She tightened\r\nher arms until they ached, tauted the thin strips of muscle under\r\nher soft flesh, and with a mighty effort raised it and held it.\r\nShe felt the wind blow cold on her back where her dress had come\r\napart from the strain of her effort, and as she felt it she\r\nturned toward it and staggered under the great weight out through\r\nthe library and on toward the front door.  She must be\r\nquick--she must be strong. The blood in her arms throbbed dully\r\nand her knees kept giving way under her, but the feel of the cool\r\nglass was good.\r\n\r\nOut the front door she tottered and over to the stone steps, and\r\nthere, summoning every fibre of her soul and body for a last\r\neffort, swung herself half around--for a second, as she tried to\r\nloose her hold, her numb fingers clung to the rough surface, and\r\nin that second she slipped and, losing balance, toppled forward\r\nwith a despairing cry, her arms still around the bowl . . . down\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nOver the way lights went on; far down the block the crash was\r\nheard, and pedestrians rushed up wonderingly; up-stairs a tired\r\nman awoke from the edge of sleep and a little girl whimpered in a\r\nhaunted doze. And all over the moonlit sidewalk around the\r\nstill, black form, hundreds of prisms and cubes and splinters of\r\nglass reflected the light in little gleams of blue, and black\r\nedged with yellow, and yellow, and crimson edged with black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBernice Bobs Her Hair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dark on Saturday night one could stand on the first tee of\r\nthe golf-course and see the country-club windows as a yellow\r\nexpanse over a very black and wavy ocean. The waves of this\r\nocean, so to speak, were the heads of many curious caddies, a few\r\nof the more ingenious chauffeurs, the golf professional\'s deaf\r\nsister--and there were usually several stray, diffident waves who\r\nmight have rolled inside had they so desired. This was the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nThe balcony was inside. It consisted of the circle of wicker\r\nchairs that lined the wall of the combination clubroom and\r\nballroom. At these Saturday-night dances it was largely feminine;\r\na great babel of middle-aged ladies with sharp eyes and icy\r\nhearts behind lorgnettes and large bosoms. The main function of\r\nthe balcony was critical, it occasionally showed grudging\r\nadmiration, but never approval, for it is well known among ladies\r\nover thirty-five that when the younger set dance in the\r\nsummer-time it is with the very worst intentions in the world,\r\nand if they are not bombarded with stony eyes stray couples will\r\ndance weird barbaric interludes in the corners, and the more\r\npopular, more dangerous, girls will sometimes be kissed in the\r\nparked limousines of unsuspecting dowagers.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, this critical circle is not close enough to the\r\nstage to see the actors\' faces and catch the subtler byplay. It\r\ncan only frown and lean, ask questions and make satisfactory\r\ndeductions from its set of postulates, such as the one which\r\nstates that every young man with a large income leads the life of\r\na hunted partridge. It never really appreciates the drama of the\r\nshifting, semi-cruel world of adolescence. No; boxes,\r\norchestra-circle, principals, and chorus be represented by the\r\nmedley of faces and voices that sway to the plaintive African\r\nrhythm of Dyer\'s dance orchestra.\r\n\r\nFrom sixteen-year-old Otis Ormonde, who has two more years at\r\nHill School, to G. Reece Stoddard, over whose bureau at home\r\nhangs a Harvard law diploma; from little Madeleine Hogue, whose\r\nhair still feels strange and uncomfortable on top of her head, to\r\nBessie MacRae, who has been the life of the party a little too\r\nlong--more than ten years--the medley is not only the centre of\r\nthe stage but contains the only people capable of getting an\r\nunobstructed view of it.\r\n\r\nWith a flourish and a bang the music stops. The couples exchange\r\nartificial, effortless smiles, facetiously repeat "LA-de-DA-DA\r\ndum-DUM," and then the clatter of young feminine voices soars\r\nover the burst of clapping.\r\n\r\nA few disappointed stags caught in midfloor as they had been\r\nabout to cut in subsided listlessly back to the walls, because\r\nthis was not like the riotous Christmas dances--these summer\r\nhops were considered just pleasantly warm and exciting, where\r\neven the younger marrieds rose and performed ancient waltzes and\r\nterrifying fox trots to the tolerant amusement of their younger\r\nbrothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nWarren McIntyre, who casually attended Yale, being one of the\r\nunfortunate stags, felt in his dinner-coat pocket for a cigarette\r\nand strolled out onto the wide, semidark veranda, where couples\r\nwere scattered at tables, filling the lantern-hung night with\r\nvague words and hazy laughter. He nodded here and there at the\r\nless absorbed and as he passed each couple some half-forgotten\r\nfragment of a story played in his mind, for it was not a large\r\ncity and every one was Who\'s Who to every one else\'s past. There,\r\nfor example, were Jim Strain and Ethel Demorest, who had been\r\nprivately engaged for three years. Every one knew that as soon as\r\nJim managed to hold a job for more than two months she would\r\nmarry him. Yet how bored they both looked, and how wearily Ethel\r\nregarded Jim sometimes, as if she wondered why she had trained\r\nthe vines of her affection on such a wind-shaken poplar.\r\n\r\nWarren was nineteen and rather pitying with those of his friends\r\nwho hadn\'t gone East to college. But, like most boys, he bragged\r\ntremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from\r\nit. There was Genevieve Ormonde, who regularly made the rounds of\r\ndances, house-parties, and football games at Princeton, Yale,\r\nWilliams, and Cornell; there was black-eyed Roberta Dillon, who\r\nwas quite as famous to her own generation as Hiram Johnson or Ty\r\nCobb; and, of course, there was Marjorie Harvey, who besides\r\nhaving a fairylike face and a dazzling, bewildering tongue was\r\nalready justly celebrated for having turned five cart-wheels in\r\nsuccession during the last pump-and-slipper dance at New Haven.\r\n\r\nWarren, who had grown up across the street from Marjorie, had\r\nlong been "crazy about her." Sometimes she seemed to reciprocate\r\nhis feeling with a faint gratitude, but she had tried him by her\r\ninfallible test and informed him gravely that she did not love\r\nhim. Her test was that when she was away from him she forgot him\r\nand had affairs with other boys. Warren found this discouraging,\r\nespecially as Marjorie had been making little trips all summer,\r\nand for the first two or three days after each arrival home he\r\nsaw great heaps of mail on the Harveys\' hall table addressed to\r\nher in various masculine handwritings. To make matters worse, all\r\nduring the month of August she had been visited by her cousin\r\nBernice from Eau Claire, and it seemed impossible to see her\r\nalone. It was always necessary to hunt round and find some one to\r\ntake care of Bernice. As August waned this was becoming more and\r\nmore difficult.\r\n\r\nMuch as Warren worshipped Marjorie he had to admit that Cousin\r\nBernice was sorta dopeless. She was pretty, with dark hair and\r\nhigh color, but she was no fun on a party. Every Saturday night\r\nhe danced a long arduous duty dance with her to please Marjorie,\r\nbut he had never been anything but bored in her company.\r\n\r\n"Warren"---a soft voice at his elbow broke in upon his thoughts,\r\nand he turned to see Marjorie, flushed and radiant as usual. She\r\nlaid a hand on his shoulder and a glow settled almost\r\nimperceptibly over him.\r\n\r\n"Warren," she whispered "do something for me--dance with Bernice.\r\nShe\'s been stuck with little Otis Ormonde for almost an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\nWarren\'s glow faded.\r\n\r\n"Why--sure," he answered half-heartedly.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mind, do you? I\'ll see that you don\'t get stuck."\r\n\r\n"\'Sall right."\r\n\r\nMarjorie smiled--that smile that was thanks enough.\r\n\r\n"You\'re an angel, and I\'m obliged loads."\r\n\r\nWith a sigh the angel glanced round the veranda, but Bernice and\r\nOtis were not in sight. He wandered back inside, and there in\r\nfront of the women\'s dressing-room he found Otis in the centre of\r\na group of young men who were convulsed with laughter. Otis was\r\nbrandishing a piece of timber he had picked up, and discoursing\r\nvolubly.\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone in to fix her hair," he announced wildly. "I\'m\r\nwaiting to dance another hour with her."\r\n\r\nTheir laughter was renewed.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t some of you cut in?" cried Otis resentfully. "She\r\nlikes more variety."\r\n\r\n"Why, Otis," suggested a friend "you\'ve just barely got used to\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Why the two-by-four, Otis?" inquired Warren, smiling.\r\n\r\n"The two-by-four? Oh, this? This is a club. When she comes out\r\nI\'ll hit her on the head and knock her in again."\r\n\r\nWarren collapsed on a settee and howled with glee.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Otis," he articulated finally. "I\'m relieving you\r\nthis time."\r\n\r\nOtis simulated a sudden fainting attack and handed the stick to\r\nWarren.\r\n\r\n"If you need it, old man," he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\nNo matter how beautiful or brilliant a girl may be, the\r\nreputation of not being frequently cut in on makes her position\r\nat a dance unfortunate. Perhaps boys prefer her company to that\r\nof the butterflies with whom they dance a dozen times an but,\r\nyouth in this jazz-nourished generation is temperamentally\r\nrestless, and the idea of fox-trotting more than one full fox\r\ntrot with the same girl is distasteful, not to say odious. When\r\nit comes to several dances and the intermissions between she can\r\nbe quite sure that a young man, once relieved, will never tread\r\non her wayward toes again.\r\n\r\nWarren danced the next full dance with Bernice, and finally,\r\nthankful for the intermission, he led her to a table on the\r\nveranda. There was a moment\'s silence while she did unimpressive\r\nthings with her fan.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hotter here than in Eau Claire," she said.\r\n\r\nWarren stifled a sigh and nodded. It might be for all he knew or\r\ncared. He wondered idly whether she was a poor conversationalist\r\nbecause she got no attention or got no attention because she was\r\na poor conversationalist.\r\n\r\n"You going to be here much longer?" he asked and then turned\r\nrather red. She might suspect his reasons for asking.\r\n\r\n"Another week," she answered, and stared at him as if to lunge at\r\nhis next remark when it left his lips.\r\n\r\nWarren fidgeted. Then with a sudden charitable impulse he decided\r\nto try part of his line on her. He turned and looked at her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got an awfully kissable mouth," he began quietly.\r\n\r\nThis was a remark that he sometimes made to girls at college\r\nproms when they were talking in just such half dark as this.\r\nBernice distinctly jumped. She turned an ungraceful red and\r\nbecame clumsy with her fan. No one had ever made such a remark to\r\nher before.\r\n\r\n"Fresh!"---the word had slipped out before she realized it, and\r\nshe bit her lip. Too late she decided to be amused, and offered\r\nhim a flustered smile.\r\n\r\nWarren was annoyed. Though not accustomed to have that remark\r\ntaken seriously, still it usually provoked a laugh or a paragraph\r\nof sentimental banter. And he hated to be called fresh, except\r\nin a joking way. His charitable impulse died and he switched the\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\n"Jim Strain and Ethel Demorest sitting out as usual," he\r\ncommented.\r\n\r\nThis was more in Bernice\'s line, but a faint regret mingled with\r\nher relief as the subject changed. Men did not talk to her about\r\nkissable mouths, but she knew that they talked in some such way\r\nto other girls.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," she said, and laughed. "I hear they\'ve been mooning\r\naround for years without a red penny. Isn\'t it silly?"\r\n\r\nWarren\'s disgust increased. Jim Strain was a close friend of his\r\nbrother\'s, and anyway he considered it bad form to sneer at\r\npeople for not having money. But Bernice had had no intention of\r\nsneering. She was merely nervous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Marjorie and Bernice reached home at half after midnight\r\nthey said good night at the top of the stairs. Though cousins,\r\nthey were not intimates. As a matter of fact Marjorie had no\r\nfemale intimates--she considered girls stupid. Bernice on the\r\ncontrary all through this parent-arranged visit had rather longed\r\nto exchange those confidences flavored with giggles and tears\r\nthat she considered an indispensable factor in all feminine\r\nintercourse. But in this respect she found Marjorie rather cold;\r\nfelt somehow the same difficulty in talking to her that she had\r\nin talking to men. Marjorie never giggled, was never frightened,\r\nseldom embarrassed, and in fact had very few of the qualities\r\nwhich Bernice considered appropriately and blessedly feminine.\r\n\r\nAs Bernice busied herself with tooth-brush and paste this night\r\nshe wondered for the hundredth time why she never had any\r\nattention when she was away from home. That her family were the\r\nwealthiest in Eau Claire; that her mother entertained\r\ntremendously, gave little diners for her daughter before all\r\ndances and bought her a car of her own to drive round in, never\r\noccurred to her as factors in her home-town social success. Like\r\nmost girls she had been brought up on the warm milk prepared by\r\nAnnie Fellows Johnston and on novels in which the female was\r\nbeloved because of certain mysterious womanly qualities always\r\nmentioned but never displayed.\r\n\r\nBernice felt a vague pain that she was not at present engaged in\r\nbeing popular. She did not know that had it not been for\r\nMarjorie\'s campaigning she would have danced the entire evening\r\nwith one man; but she knew that even in Eau Claire other girls\r\nwith less position and less pulchritude were given a much bigger\r\nrush. She attributed this to something subtly unscrupulous in\r\nthose girls. It had never worried her, and if it had her mother\r\nwould have assured her that the other girls cheapened themselves\r\nand that men really respected girls like Bernice.\r\n\r\nShe turned out the light in her bathroom, and on an impulse\r\ndecided to go in and chat for a moment with her aunt Josephine,\r\nwhose light was still on. Her soft slippers bore her noiselessly\r\ndown the carpeted hall, but hearing voices inside she stopped\r\nnear the partly openers door. Then she caught her own name, and\r\nwithout any definite intention of eavesdropping lingered--and the\r\nthread of the conversation going on inside pierced her\r\nconsciousness sharply as if it had been drawn through with a\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\n"She\'s absolutely hopeless!" It was Marjorie\'s voice. "Oh, I know\r\nwhat you\'re going to say! So many people have told you how\r\npretty and sweet she is, and how she can cook! What of it? She\r\nhas a bum time. Men don\'t like her."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a little cheap popularity?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harvey sounded annoyed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s everything when you\'re eighteen," said Marjorie\r\nemphatically. "I\'ve done my best. I\'ve been polite and I\'ve made\r\nmen dance with her, but they just won\'t stand being bored. When I\r\nthink of that gorgeous coloring wasted on such a ninny, and\r\nthink what Martha Carey could do with it--oh!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no courtesy these days."\r\n\r\nMrs. Harvey\'s voice implied that modern situations were too much\r\nfor her. When she was a girl all young ladies who belonged to\r\nnice families had glorious times.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Marjorie, "no girl can permanently bolster up a\r\nlame-duck visitor, because these days it\'s every girl for\r\nherself. I\'ve even tried to drop hints about clothes and things,\r\nand she\'s been furious--given me the funniest looks. She\'s\r\nsensitive enough to know she\'s not getting away with much, but\r\nI\'ll bet she consoles herself by thinking that she\'s very\r\nvirtuous and that I\'m too gay and fickle and will come to a bad\r\nend. All unpopular girls think that way. Sour grapes! Sarah\r\nHopkins refers to Genevieve and Roberta and me as gardenia girls!\r\nI\'ll bet she\'d give ten years of her life and her European\r\neducation to be a gardenia girl and have three or four men in\r\nlove with her and be cut in on every few feet at dances."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," interrupted Mrs. Harvey rather wearily, "that\r\nyou ought to be able to do something for Bernice. I know she\'s\r\nnot very vivacious."\r\n\r\nMarjorie groaned.\r\n\r\n"Vivacious! Good grief! I\'ve never heard her say anything to a\r\nboy except that it\'s hot or the floor\'s crowded or that she\'s\r\ngoing to school in New York next year. Sometimes she asks them\r\nwhat kind of car they have and tells them the kind she has.\r\nThrilling!"\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence and then Mrs. Harvey took up her\r\nrefrain:\r\n\r\n"All I know is that other girls not half so sweet and attractive\r\nget partners. Martha Carey, for instance, is stout and loud, and\r\nher mother is distinctly common. Roberta Dillon is so thin this\r\nyear that she looks as though Arizona were the place for her.\r\nShe\'s dancing herself to death."\r\n\r\n"But, mother," objected Marjorie impatiently, "Martha is cheerful\r\nand awfully witty and an awfully slick girl, and Roberta\'s a\r\nmarvellous dancer. She\'s been popular for ages!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harvey yawned.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s that crazy Indian blood in Bernice," continued\r\nMarjorie. "Maybe she\'s a reversion to type.  Indian women all\r\njust sat round and never said anything."\r\n\r\n"Go to bed, you silly child," laughed Mrs. Harvey. "I wouldn\'t\r\nhave told you that if I\'d thought you were going to remember it.\r\nAnd I think most of your ideas are perfectly idiotic," she\r\nfinished sleepily.\r\n\r\nThere was another silence, while Marjorie considered whether or\r\nnot convincing her mother was worth the trouble. People over\r\nforty can seldom be permanently convinced of anything. At\r\neighteen our convictions are hills from which we look; at\r\nforty-five they are caves in which we hide.\r\n\r\nHaving decided this, Marjorie said good night. When she came out\r\ninto the hall it was quite empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Marjorie was breakfasting late next day Bernice came into\r\nthe room with a rather formal good morning, sat down opposite,\r\nstared intently over and slightly moistened her lips.\r\n\r\n"What\'s on your mind?" inquired Marjorie, rather puzzled.\r\n\r\nBernice paused before she threw her hand-grenade.\r\n\r\n"I heard what you said about me to your mother last night."\r\n\r\nMarjorie was startled, but she showed only a faintly heightened\r\ncolor and her voice was quite even when she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Where were you?"\r\n\r\n"In the hall. I didn\'t mean to listen--at first."\r\n\r\nAfter an involuntary look of contempt Marjorie dropped her eyes\r\nand became very interested in balancing a stray corn-flake on her\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'d better go back to Eau Claire--if I\'m such a\r\nnuisance." Bernice\'s lower lip was trembling violently and she\r\ncontinued on a wavering note: "I\'ve tried to be nice, and--and\r\nI\'ve been first neglected and then insulted. No one ever visited\r\nme and got such treatment."\r\n\r\nMarjorie was silent.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m in the way, I see. I\'m a drag on you. Your friends don\'t\r\nlike me." She paused, and then remembered another one of her\r\ngrievances. "Of course I was furious last week when you tried to\r\nhint to me that that dress was unbecoming. Don\'t you think I know\r\nhow to dress myself?"\r\n\r\n"No," murmured less than half-aloud.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t hint anything," said Marjorie succinctly. "I said, as I\r\nremember, that it was better to wear a becoming dress three\r\ntimes straight than to alternate it with two frights."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that was a very nice thing to say?"\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t trying to be nice." Then after a pause: "When do you\r\nwant to go?"\r\n\r\nBernice drew in her breath sharply.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" It was a little half-cry.\r\n\r\nMarjorie looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you say you were going?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you were only bluffing!"\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other across the breakfast-table for a\r\nmoment. Misty waves were passing before Bernice\'s eyes, while\r\nMarjorie\'s face wore that rather hard expression that she used\r\nwhen slightly intoxicated undergraduate\'s were making love to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"So you were bluffing," she repeated as if it were what she might\r\nhave expected.\r\n\r\nBernice admitted it by bursting into tears. Marjorie\'s eyes\r\nshowed boredom.\r\n\r\n"You\'re my cousin," sobbed Bernice. "I\'m v-v-visiting you. I was\r\nto stay a month, and if I go home my mother will know and she\'ll\r\nwah-wonder---"\r\n\r\nMarjorie waited until the shower of broken words collapsed into\r\nlittle sniffles.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you my month\'s allowance," she said coldly, "and you\r\ncan spend this last week anywhere you want. There\'s a very nice\r\nhotel---"\r\n\r\nBernice\'s sobs rose to a flute note, and rising of a sudden she\r\nfled from the room.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, while Marjorie was in the library absorbed in\r\ncomposing one of those non-committal marvelously elusive letters\r\nthat only a young girl can write, Bernice reappeared, very\r\nred-eyed, and consciously calm. She cast no glance at Marjorie\r\nbut took a book at random from the shelf and sat down as if to\r\nread. Marjorie seemed absorbed in her letter and continued\r\nwriting. When the clock showed noon Bernice closed her book with\r\na snap.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'d better get my railroad ticket."\r\n\r\nThis was not the beginning of the speech she had rehearsed\r\nup-stairs, but as Marjorie was not getting her cues--wasn\'t\r\nurging her to be reasonable; it\'s an a mistake--it was the best\r\nopening she could muster.\r\n\r\n"Just wait till I finish this letter," said Marjorie without\r\nlooking round. "I want to get it off in the next mail."\r\n\r\nAfter another minute, during which her pen scratched busily, she\r\nturned round and relaxed with an air of "at your service." Again\r\nBernice had to speak.\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to go home?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Marjorie, considering, "I suppose if you\'re not\r\nhaving a good time you\'d better go. No use being miserable."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think common kindness---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please don\'t quote \'Little Women\'!" cried Marjorie\r\nimpatiently. "That\'s out of style."\r\n\r\n"You think so?"\r\n\r\n"Heavens, yes! What modern girl could live like those inane\r\nfemales?"\r\n\r\n"They were the models for our mothers."\r\n\r\nMarjorie laughed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they were--not! Besides, our mothers were all very well in\r\ntheir way, but they know very little about their daughters\'\r\nproblems."\r\n\r\nBernice drew herself up.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t talk about my mother."\r\n\r\nMarjorie laughed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I mentioned her."\r\n\r\nBernice felt that she was being led away from her subject.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you\'ve treated me very well?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done my best. You\'re rather hard material to work with."\r\n\r\nThe lids of Bernice\'s eyes reddened.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re hard and selfish, and you haven\'t a feminine\r\nquality in you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Lord!" cried Marjorie in desperation "You little nut!\r\nGirls like you are responsible for all the tiresome colorless\r\nmarriages; all those ghastly inefficiencies that pass as feminine\r\nqualities. What a blow it must be when a man with imagination\r\nmarries the beautiful bundle of clothes that he\'s been building\r\nideals round, and finds that she\'s just a weak, whining, cowardly\r\nmass of affectations!"\r\n\r\nBernice\'s mouth had slipped half open.\r\n\r\n"The womanly woman!" continued Marjorie. "Her whole early life is\r\noccupied in whining criticisms of girls like me who really do\r\nhave a good time."\r\n\r\nBernice\'s jaw descended farther as Marjorie\'s voice rose.\r\n\r\n"There\'s some excuse for an ugly girl whining. If I\'d been\r\nirretrievably ugly I\'d never have forgiven my parents for\r\nbringing me into the world. But you\'re starting life without any\r\nhandicap--" Marjorie\'s little fist clinched, "If you expect me to\r\nweep with you you\'ll be disappointed. Go or stay, just as you\r\nlike." And picking up her letters she left the room.\r\n\r\nBernice claimed a headache and failed to appear at luncheon. They\r\nhad a matin\xe9e date for the afternoon, but the headache\r\npersisting, Marjorie made explanation to a not very downcast boy.\r\nBut when she returned late in the afternoon she found Bernice\r\nwith a strangely set face waiting for her in her bedroom.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve decided," began Bernice without preliminaries, "that maybe\r\nyou\'re right about things--possibly not. But if you\'ll tell me\r\nwhy your friends aren\'t--aren\'t interested in me I\'ll see if I\r\ncan do what you want me to."\r\n\r\nMarjorie was at the mirror shaking down her hair.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Without reservations? Will you do exactly what I say?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I---"\r\n\r\n"Well nothing! Will you do exactly as I say?"\r\n\r\n"If they\'re sensible things."\r\n\r\n"They\'re not! You\'re no case for sensible things."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to make--to recommend---"\r\n\r\n"Yes, everything. If I tell you to take boxing-lessons you\'ll\r\nhave to do it. Write home and tell your mother you\'re going\' to\r\nstay another two weeks.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll tell me---"\r\n\r\n"All right--I\'ll just give you a few examples now. First you have\r\nno ease of manner. Why? Because you\'re never sure about your\r\npersonal appearance. When a girl feels that she\'s perfectly\r\ngroomed and dressed she can forget that part of her. That\'s\r\ncharm. The more parts of yourself you can afford to forget the\r\nmore charm you have."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I look all right?"\r\n\r\n"No; for instance you never take care of your eyebrows. They\'re\r\nblack and lustrous, but by leaving them straggly they\'re a\r\nblemish. They\'d be beautiful if you\'d take care of them in\r\none-tenth the time you take doing nothing. You\'re going to brush\r\nthem so that they\'ll grow straight."\r\n\r\nBernice raised the brows in question.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that men notice eyebrows?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--subconsciously. And when you go home you ought to have your\r\nteeth straightened a little. It\'s almost imperceptible,\r\nstill---"\r\n\r\n"But I thought," interrupted Bernice in bewilderment, "that you\r\ndespised little dainty feminine things like that."\r\n\r\n"I hate dainty minds," answered Marjorie. "But a girl has to be\r\ndainty in person. If she looks like a million dollars she can\r\ntalk about Russia, ping-pong, or the League of Nations and get\r\naway with it."\r\n\r\n"What else?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m just beginning! There\'s your dancing."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I dance all right?"\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t--you lean on a man; yes, you do--ever so slightly.\r\nI noticed it when we were dancing together yesterday. And you\r\ndance standing up straight instead of bending over a little.\r\nProbably some old lady on the side-line once told you that you\r\nlooked so dignified that way. But except with a very small girl\r\nit\'s much harder on the man, and he\'s the one that counts."\r\n\r\n"Go on." Bernice\'s brain was reeling.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve got to learn to be nice to men who are sad birds.\r\nYou look as if you\'d been insulted whenever you\'re thrown with\r\nany except the most popular boys. Why, Bernice, I\'m cut in on\r\nevery few feet--and who does most of it? Why, those very sad\r\nbirds. No girl can afford to neglect them. They\'re the big part\r\nof any crowd. Young boys too shy to talk are the very best\r\nconversational practice. Clumsy boys are the best dancing\r\npractice. If you can follow them and yet look graceful you can\r\nfollow a baby tank across a barb-wire sky-scraper."\r\n\r\nBernice sighed profoundly, but Marjorie was not through.\r\n\r\n"If you go to a dance and really amuse, say, three sad birds that\r\ndance with you; if you talk so well to them that they forget\r\nthey\'re stuck with you, you\'ve done something. They\'ll come back\r\nnext time, and gradually so many sad birds will dance with you\r\nthat the attractive boys will see there\'s no danger of being\r\nstuck--then they\'ll dance with you."\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Bernice faintly. "I think I begin to see."\r\n\r\n"And finally," concluded Marjorie, "poise and charm will just\r\ncome. You\'ll wake up some morning knowing you\'ve attained it and\r\nmen will know it too."\r\n\r\nBernice rose.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been awfully kind of you--but nobody\'s ever talked to me\r\nlike this before, and I feel sort of startled."\r\n\r\nMarjorie made no answer but gazed pensively at her own image in\r\nthe mirror.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a peach to help me," continued Bernice.\r\n\r\nStill Marjorie did not answer, and Bernice thought she had seemed\r\ntoo grateful.\r\n\r\n"I know you don\'t like sentiment," she said timidly.\r\n\r\nMarjorie turned to her quickly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wasn\'t thinking about that. I was considering whether we\r\nhadn\'t better bob your hair."\r\n\r\nBernice collapsed backward upon the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following Wednesday evening there was a dinner-dance at\r\nthe country club. When the guests strolled in Bernice found her\r\nplace-card with a slight feeling of irritation. Though at her\r\nright sat G. Reece Stoddard, a most desirable and distinguished\r\nyoung bachelor, the all-important left held only Charley Paulson.\r\nCharley lacked height, beauty, and social shrewdness, and in her\r\nnew enlightenment Bernice decided that his only qualification to\r\nbe her partner was that he had never been stuck with her.  But\r\nthis feeling of irritation left with the last of the soup-plates,\r\nand Marjorie\'s specific instruction came to her. Swallowing her\r\npride she turned to Charley Paulson and plunged.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I ought to bob my hair, Mr. Charley Paulson?"\r\n\r\nCharley looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'m considering it. It\'s such a sure and easy way of\r\nattracting attention."\r\n\r\nCharley smiled pleasantly. He could not know this had been\r\nrehearsed. He replied that he didn\'t know much about bobbed hair.\r\nBut Bernice was there to tell him.\r\n\r\n"I want to be a society vampire, you see," she announced coolly,\r\nand went on to inform him that bobbed hair was the necessary\r\nprelude. She added that she wanted to ask his advice, because she\r\nhad heard he was so critical about girls.\r\n\r\nCharley, who knew as much about the psychology of women as he did\r\nof the mental states of Buddhist contemplatives, felt vaguely\r\nflattered.\r\n\r\n"So I\'ve decided," she continued, her voice rising slightly,\r\n"that early next week I\'m going down to the Sevier Hotel\r\nbarber-shop, sit in the first chair, and get my hair bobbed." She\r\nfaltered noticing that the people near her had paused in their\r\nconversation and were listening; but after a confused second\r\nMarjorie\'s coaching told, and she finished her paragraph to the\r\nvicinity at large. "Of course I\'m charging admission, but if\r\nyou\'ll all come down and encourage me I\'ll issue passes for the\r\ninside seats."\r\n\r\nThere was a ripple of appreciative laughter, and under cover of\r\nit G. Reece Stoddard leaned over quickly and said close to her\r\near: "I\'ll take a box right now."\r\n\r\nShe met his eyes and smiled as if he had said something\r\nsurprisingly brilliant.\r\n\r\n"Do you believe in bobbed hair?" asked G. Reece in the same\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s unmoral," affirmed Bernice gravely. "But, of\r\ncourse, you\'ve either got to amuse people or feed \'em or shock\r\n\'em." Marjorie had culled this from Oscar Wilde. It was greeted\r\nwith a ripple of laughter from the men and a series of quick,\r\nintent looks from the girls. And then as though she had said\r\nnothing of wit or moment Bernice turned again to Charley and\r\nspoke confidentially in his ear.\r\n\r\n"I want to ask you your opinion of several people. I imagine\r\nyou\'re a wonderful judge of character."\r\n\r\nCharley thrilled faintly--paid her a subtle compliment by\r\noverturning her water.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, while Warren McIntyre was standing passively in\r\nthe stag line abstractedly watching the dancers and wondering\r\nwhither and with whom Marjorie had disappeared, an unrelated\r\nperception began to creep slowly upon him--a perception that\r\nBernice, cousin to Marjorie, had been cut in on several times in\r\nthe past five minutes. He closed his eyes, opened them and looked\r\nagain. Several minutes back she had been dancing with a visiting\r\nboy, a matter easily accounted for; a visiting boy would know no\r\nbetter. But now she was dancing with some one else, and there\r\nwas Charley Paulson headed for her with enthusiastic\r\ndetermination in his eye. Funny--Charley seldom danced with more\r\nthan three girls an evening.\r\n\r\nWarren was distinctly surprised when--the exchange having been\r\neffected--the man relieved proved to be none ether than G. Reece\r\nStoddard himself. And G. Reece seemed not at all jubilant at\r\nbeing relieved. Next time Bernice danced near, Warren regarded\r\nher intently. Yes, she was pretty, distinctly pretty; and\r\nto-night her face seemed really vivacious. She had that look that\r\nno woman, however histrionically proficient, can successfully\r\ncounterfeit--she looked as if she were having a good time. He\r\nliked the way she had her hair arranged, wondered if it was\r\nbrilliantine that made it glisten so. And that dress was\r\nbecoming--a dark red that set off her shadowy eyes and high\r\ncoloring. He remembered that he had thought her pretty when she\r\nfirst came to town, before he had realized that she was dull. Too\r\nbad she was dull--dull girls unbearable--certainly pretty\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts zigzagged back to Marjorie. This disappearance would\r\nbe like other disappearances. When she reappeared he would\r\ndemand where she had been--would be told emphatically that it was\r\nnone of his business. What a pity she was so sure of him! She\r\nbasked in the knowledge that no other girl in town interested\r\nhim; she defied him to fall in love with Genevieve or\r\nRoberta.\r\n\r\nWarren sighed. The way to Marjorie\'s affections was a labyrinth\r\nindeed. He looked up. Bernice was again dancing with the visiting\r\nboy. Half unconsciously he took a step out from the stag line in\r\nher direction, and hesitated. Then he said to himself that it\r\nwas charity. He walked toward her--collided suddenly with G.\r\nReece Stoddard.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said Warren.\r\n\r\nBut G. Reece had not stopped to apologize. He had again cut in on\r\nBernice.\r\n\r\nThat night at one o\'clock Marjorie, with one hand on the\r\nelectric-light switch in the hall, turned to take a last look at\r\nBernice\'s sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n"So it worked?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Marjorie, yes!" cried Bernice.\r\n\r\n"I saw you were having a gay time."\r\n\r\n"I did! The only trouble was that about midnight I ran short of\r\ntalk. I had to repeat myself--with different men of course. I\r\nhope they won\'t compare notes."\r\n\r\n"Men don\'t," said Marjorie, yawning, "and it wouldn\'t matter if\r\nthey did--they\'d think you were even trickier."\r\n\r\nShe snapped out the light, and as they started up the stairs\r\nBernice grasped the banister thankfully. For the first time in\r\nher life she had been danced tired.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Marjorie it the top of the stairs, "one man sees\r\nanother man cut in and he thinks there must be something there.\r\nWell, we\'ll fix up some new stuff to-morrow.  Good night."\r\n\r\n"Good night."\r\n\r\nAs Bernice took down her hair she passed the evening before her\r\nin review.  She had followed instructions exactly.  Even when\r\nCharley Paulson cut in for the eighth time she had simulated\r\ndelight and had apparently been both interested and flattered.\r\nShe had not talked about the weather or Eau Claire or automobiles\r\nor her school, but had confined her conversation to me, you, and\r\nus.\r\n\r\nBut a few minutes before she fell asleep a rebellious thought was\r\nchurning drowsily in her brain--after all, it was she who had\r\ndone it.  Marjorie, to be sure, had given her her conversation,\r\nbut then Marjorie got much of her conversation out of things she\r\nread.  Bernice had bought the red dress, though she had never\r\nvalued it highly before Marjorie dug it out of her trunk--and her\r\nown voice had said the words, her own lips had smiled, her own\r\nfeet had danced.  Marjorie nice girl--vain, though--nice\r\nevening--nice boys--like Warren--Warren--Warren--what\'s his\r\nname--Warren---\r\n\r\nShe fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Bernice the next week was a revelation.  With the feeling that\r\npeople really enjoyed looking at her and listening to her came\r\nthe foundation of self-confidence.  Of course there were numerous\r\nmistakes at first.  She did not know, for instance, that\r\nDraycott Deyo was studying for the ministry; she was unaware that\r\nhe had cut in on her because he thought she was a quiet,\r\nreserved girl. Had she known these things she would not have\r\ntreated him to the line which began "Hello, Shell Shock!" and\r\ncontinued with the bathtub story--"It takes a frightful lot of\r\nenergy to fix my hair in the summer--there\'s so much of it--so I\r\nalways fix it first and powder my face and put on my hat; then I\r\nget into the bathtub, and dress afterward. Don\'t you think that\'s\r\nthe best plan?"\r\n\r\nThough Draycott Deyo was in the throes of difficulties concerning\r\nbaptism by immersion and might possibly have seen a connection,\r\nit must be admitted that he did not. He considered feminine\r\nbathing an immoral subject, and gave her some of his ideas on the\r\ndepravity of modern society.\r\n\r\nBut to offset that unfortunate occurrence Bernice had several\r\nsignal successes to her credit. Little Otis Ormonde pleaded off\r\nfrom a trip East and elected instead to follow her with a\r\npuppylike devotion, to the amusement of his crowd and to the\r\nirritation of G. Reece Stoddard, several of whose afternoon calls\r\nOtis completely ruined by the disgusting tenderness of the\r\nglances he bent on Bernice. He even told her the story of the\r\ntwo-by-four and the dressing-room to show her how frightfully\r\nmistaken he and every one else had been in their first judgment\r\nof her. Bernice laughed off that incident with a slight sinking\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nOf all Bernice\'s conversation perhaps the best known and most\r\nuniversally approved was the line about the bobbing of her hair.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bernice, when you goin\' to get the hair bobbed?"\r\n\r\n"Day after to-morrow maybe," she would reply, laughing. "Will you\r\ncome and see me? Because I\'m counting on you, you know."\r\n\r\n"Will we? You know! But you better hurry up."\r\n\r\nBernice, whose tonsorial intentions were strictly dishonorable,\r\nwould laugh again.\r\n\r\n"Pretty soon now. You\'d be surprised."\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most significant symbol of her success was the\r\ngray car of the hypercritical Warren McIntyre, parked daily in\r\nfront of the Harvey house. At first the parlor-maid was\r\ndistinctly startled when he asked for Bernice instead of\r\nMarjorie; after a week of it she told the cook that Miss Bernice\r\nhad gotta holda Miss Marjorie\'s best fella.\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Bernice had. Perhaps it began with Warren\'s desire to\r\nrouse jealousy in Marjorie; perhaps it was the familiar though\r\nunrecognized strain of Marjorie in Bernice\'s conversation;\r\nperhaps it was both of these and something of sincere attraction\r\nbesides. But somehow the collective mind of the younger set knew\r\nwithin a week that Marjorie\'s most reliable beau had made an\r\namazing face-about and was giving an indisputable rush to\r\nMarjorie\'s guest. The question of the moment was how Marjorie\r\nwould take it. Warren called Bernice on the \'phone twice a day,\r\nsent her notes, and they were frequently seen together in his\r\nroadster, obviously engrossed in one of those tense, significant\r\nconversations as to whether or not he was sincere.\r\n\r\nMarjorie on being twitted only laughed. She said she was mighty\r\nglad that Warren had at last found some one who appreciated him.\r\nSo the younger set laughed, too, and guessed that Marjorie didn\'t\r\ncare and let it go at that.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon when there were only three days left of her visit\r\nBernice was waiting in the hall for Warren, with whom she was\r\ngoing to a bridge party. She was in rather a blissful mood, and\r\nwhen Marjorie--also bound for the party--appeared beside her and\r\nbegan casually to adjust her hat in the mirror, Bernice was\r\nutterly unprepared for anything in the nature of a clash.\r\nMarjorie did her work very coldly and succinctly in three\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\n"You may as well get Warren out of your head," she said coldly.\r\n\r\n"What?" Bernice was utterly astounded.\r\n\r\n"You may as well stop making a fool of yourself over Warren\r\nMcIntyre. He doesn\'t care a snap of his fingers about you."\r\n\r\nFor a tense moment they regarded each other--Marjorie scornful,\r\naloof; Bernice astounded, half-angry, half-afraid. Then two cars\r\ndrove up in front of the house and there was a riotous honking.\r\nBoth of them gasped faintly, turned, and side by side hurried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAll through the bridge party Bernice strove in vain to master a\r\nrising uneasiness. She had offended Marjorie, the sphinx of\r\nsphinxes. With the most wholesome and innocent intentions in the\r\nworld she had stolen Marjorie\'s property. She felt suddenly and\r\nhorribly guilty. After the bridge game, when they sat in an\r\ninformal circle and the conversation became general, the storm\r\ngradually broke. Little Otis Ormonde inadvertently precipitated\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"When you going back to kindergarten, Otis?" some one had asked.\r\n\r\n"Me? Day Bernice gets her hair bobbed."\r\n\r\n"Then your education\'s over," said Marjorie quickly. "That\'s only\r\na bluff of hers. I should think you\'d have realized."\r\n\r\n"That a fact?" demanded Otis, giving Bernice a reproachful\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nBernice\'s ears burned as she tried to think up an effectual\r\ncome-back. In the face of this direct attack her imagination was\r\nparalyzed.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a lot of bluffs in the world," continued Marjorie quite\r\npleasantly. "I should think you\'d be young enough to know that,\r\nOtis."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Otis, "maybe so. But gee!  With a line like\r\nBernice\'s---"\r\n\r\n"Really?" yawned Marjorie. "What\'s her latest bon mot?"\r\n\r\nNo one seemed to know. In fact, Bernice, having trifled with her\r\nmuse\'s beau, had said nothing memorable of late.\r\n\r\n"Was that really all a line?" asked Roberta curiously.\r\n\r\nBernice hesitated. She felt that wit in some form was demanded of\r\nher, but under her cousin\'s suddenly frigid eyes she was\r\ncompletely incapacitated.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she stalled.\r\n\r\n"Splush!" said Marjorie. "Admit it!"\r\n\r\nBernice saw that Warren\'s eyes had left a ukulele he had been\r\ntinkering with and were fixed on her questioningly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know!" she repeated steadily. Her cheeks were\r\nglowing.\r\n\r\n"Splush!" remarked Marjorie again.\r\n\r\n"Come through, Bernice," urged Otis. "Tell her where to get off."\r\nBernice looked round again--she seemed unable to get away from\r\nWarren\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"I like bobbed hair," she said hurriedly, as if he had asked her\r\na question, "and I intend to bob mine."\r\n\r\n"When?" demanded Marjorie.\r\n\r\n"Any time."\r\n\r\n"No time like the present," suggested Roberta.\r\n\r\nOtis jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Good stuff!" he cried. "We\'ll have a summer bobbing party.\r\nSevier Hotel barber-shop, I think you said."\r\n\r\nIn an instant all were on their feet. Bernice\'s heart throbbed\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n"What?" she gasped.\r\n\r\nOut of the group came Marjorie\'s voice, very clear and\r\ncontemptuous.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry--she\'ll back out!"\r\n\r\n"Come on, Bernice!" cried Otis, starting toward the door.\r\n\r\nFour eyes--Warren\'s and Marjorie\'s--stared at her, challenged\r\nher, defied her. For another second she wavered wildly.\r\n\r\n"All right," she said swiftly "I don\'t care if I do."\r\n\r\nAn eternity of minutes later, riding down-town through the late\r\nafternoon beside Warren, the others following in Roberta\'s car\r\nclose behind, Bernice had all the sensations of Marie Antoinette\r\nbound for the guillotine in a tumbrel. Vaguely she wondered why\r\nshe did not cry out that it was all a mistake. It was all she\r\ncould do to keep from clutching her hair with both bands to\r\nprotect it from the suddenly hostile world. Yet she did neither.\r\nEven the thought of her mother was no deterrent now. This was the\r\ntest supreme of her sportsmanship; her right to walk\r\nunchallenged in the starry heaven of popular girls.\r\n\r\nWarren was moodily silent, and when they came to the hotel he\r\ndrew up at the curb and nodded to Bernice to precede him out.\r\nRoberta\'s car emptied a laughing crowd into the shop, which\r\npresented two bold plate-glass windows to the street.\r\n\r\nBernice stood on the curb and looked at the sign, Sevier\r\nBarber-Shop. It was a guillotine indeed, and the hangman was the\r\nfirst barber, who, attired in a white coat and smoking a\r\ncigarette, leaned nonchalantly against the first chair. He must\r\nhave heard of her; he must have been waiting all week, smoking\r\neternal cigarettes beside that portentous, too-often-mentioned\r\nfirst chair. Would they blind-fold her? No, but they would tie a\r\nwhite cloth round her neck lest any of her blood--nonsense--hair--should\r\nget on her clothes.\r\n\r\n"All right, Bernice," said Warren quickly.\r\n\r\nWith her chin in the air she crossed the sidewalk, pushed open\r\nthe swinging screen-door, and giving not a glance to the\r\nuproarious, riotous row that occupied the waiting bench, went up\r\nto the fat barber.\r\n\r\n"I want you to bob my hair."\r\n\r\nThe first barber\'s mouth slid somewhat open. His cigarette\r\ndropped to the floor.\r\n\r\n"Huh?"\r\n\r\n"My hair--bob it!"\r\n\r\nRefusing further preliminaries, Bernice took her seat on high. A\r\nman in the chair next to her turned on his side and gave her a\r\nglance, half lather, half amazement. One barber started and\r\nspoiled little Willy Schuneman\'s monthly haircut. Mr. O\'Reilly in\r\nthe last chair grunted and swore musically in ancient Gaelic as\r\na razor bit into his cheek. Two bootblacks became wide-eyed and\r\nrushed for her feet. No, Bernice didn\'t care for a shine.\r\n\r\nOutside a passer-by stopped and stared; a couple joined him; half\r\na dozen small boys\' nose sprang into life, flattened against the\r\nglass; and snatches of conversation borne on the summer breeze\r\ndrifted in through the screen-door.\r\n\r\n"Lookada long hair on a kid!"\r\n\r\n"Where\'d yuh get \'at stuff? \'At\'s a bearded lady he just finished\r\nshavin\'."\r\n\r\nBut Bernice saw nothing, heard nothing. Her only living sense\r\ntold her that this man in the white coat had removed one\r\ntortoise-shell comb and then another; that his fingers were\r\nfumbling clumsily with unfamiliar hairpins; that this hair, this\r\nwonderful hair of hers, was going--she would never again feel its\r\nlong voluptuous pull as it hung in a dark-brown glory down her\r\nback. For a second she was near breaking down, and then the\r\npicture before her swam mechanically into her vision--Marjorie\'s\r\nmouth curling in a faint ironic smile as if to say:\r\n\r\n"Give up and get down! You tried to buck me and I called your\r\nbluff. You see you haven\'t got a prayer."\r\n\r\nAnd some last energy rose up in Bernice, for she clinched her\r\nhands under the white cloth, and there was a curious narrowing of\r\nher eyes that Marjorie remarked on to some one long afterward.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later the barber swung her round to face the\r\nmirror, and she flinched at the full extent of the damage that\r\nhad been wrought. Her hair was not curls and now it lay in lank\r\nlifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly pale face. It was\r\nugly as sin--she had known it would be ugly as sin. Her face\'s\r\nchief charm had been a Madonna-like simplicity. Now that was gone\r\nand she was--well frightfully mediocre--not stagy; only\r\nridiculous, like a Greenwich Villager who had left her spectacles\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nAs she climbed down from the chair she tried to smile--failed\r\nmiserably. She saw two of the girls exchange glances; noticed\r\nMarjorie\'s mouth curved in attenuated mockery--and that Warren\'s\r\neyes were suddenly very cold.\r\n\r\n"You see,"--her words fell into an awkward pause--"I\'ve done it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'ve--done it," admitted Warren.\r\n\r\n"Do you like it?"\r\n\r\nThere was a half-hearted "Sure" from two or three voices, another\r\nawkward pause, and then Marjorie turned swiftly and with\r\nserpentlike intensity to Warren.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind running me down to the cleaners?" she asked.\r\n"I\'ve simply got to get a dress there before supper. Roberta\'s\r\ndriving right home and she can take the others."\r\n\r\nWarren stared abstractedly at some infinite speck out the window.\r\nThen for an instant his eyes rested coldly on Bernice before\r\nthey turned to Marjorie.\r\n\r\n"Be glad to," he said slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nBernice did not fully realize the outrageous trap that had been\r\nset for her until she met her aunt\'s amazed glance just before\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n"Why Bernice!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve bobbed it, Aunt Josephine."\r\n\r\n"Why, child!"\r\n\r\n"Do you like it?"\r\n\r\n"Why Bernice!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'ve shocked you."\r\n\r\n"No, but what\'ll Mrs. Deyo think tomorrow night? Bernice, you\r\nshould have waited until after the Deyo\'s dance--you should have\r\nwaited if you wanted to do that."\r\n\r\n"It was sudden, Aunt Josephine. Anyway, why does it matter to\r\nMrs. Deyo particularly?"\r\n\r\n"Why child," cried Mrs. Harvey, "in her paper on \'The Foibles of\r\nthe Younger Generation\' that she read at the last meeting of the\r\nThursday Club she devoted fifteen minutes to bobbed hair. It\'s\r\nher pet abomination. And the dance is for you and Marjorie!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bernice, what\'ll your mother say? She\'ll think I let you do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry."\r\n\r\nDinner was an agony. She had made a hasty attempt with a\r\ncurling-iron, and burned her finger and much hair. She could see\r\nthat her aunt was both worried and grieved, and her uncle kept\r\nsaying, "Well, I\'ll be darned!" over and over in a hurt and\r\nfaintly hostile torte. And Marjorie sat very quietly, intrenched\r\nbehind a faint smile, a faintly mocking smile.\r\n\r\nSomehow she got through the evening. Three boy\'s called; Marjorie\r\ndisappeared with one of them, and Bernice made a listless\r\nunsuccessful attempt to entertain the two others--sighed\r\nthankfully as she climbed the stairs to her room at half past\r\nten. What a day!\r\n\r\nWhen she had undressed for the night the door opened and Marjorie\r\ncame in.\r\n\r\n"Bernice," she said "I\'m awfully sorry about the Deyo dance. I\'ll\r\ngive you my word of honor I\'d forgotten all about it."\r\n\r\n"\'Sall right," said Bernice shortly. Standing before the mirror\r\nshe passed her comb slowly through her short hair.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take you down-town to-morrow," continued Marjorie, "and the\r\nhairdresser\'ll fix it so you\'ll look slick. I didn\'t imagine\r\nyou\'d go through with it. I\'m really mighty sorry."\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'sall right!"\r\n\r\n"Still it\'s your last night, so I suppose it won\'t matter much."\r\n\r\nThen Bernice winced as Marjorie tossed her own hair over her\r\nshoulders and began to twist it slowly into two long blond braids\r\nuntil in her cream-colored neglig\xe9e she looked like a delicate\r\npainting of some Saxon princess. Fascinated, Bernice watched the\r\nbraids grow. Heavy and luxurious they were moving under the\r\nsupple fingers like restive snakes--and to Bernice remained this\r\nrelic and the curling-iron and a to-morrow full of eyes. She\r\ncould see G. Reece Stoddard, who liked her, assuming his Harvard\r\nmanner and telling his dinner partner that Bernice shouldn\'t have\r\nbeen allowed to go to the movies so much; she could see Draycott\r\nDeyo exchanging glances with his mother and then being\r\nconscientiously charitable to her. But then perhaps by to-morrow\r\nMrs. Deyo would have heard the news; would send round an icy\r\nlittle note requesting that she fail to appear--and behind her\r\nback they would all laugh and know that Marjorie had made a fool\r\nof her; that her chance at beauty had been sacrificed to the\r\njealous whim of a selfish girl. She sat down suddenly before the\r\nmirror, biting the inside of her cheek.\r\n\r\n"I like it," she said with an effort. "I think it\'ll be\r\nbecoming."\r\n\r\nMarjorie smiled.\r\n\r\n"It looks all right. For heaven\'s sake, don\'t let it worry you!"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Good night Bernice."\r\n\r\nBut as the door closed something snapped within Bernice. She\r\nsprang dynamically to her feet, clinching her hands, then swiftly\r\nand noiseless crossed over to her bed and from underneath it\r\ndragged out her suitcase. Into it she tossed toilet articles and\r\na change of clothing, Then she turned to her trunk and quickly\r\ndumped in two drawerfulls of lingerie and stammer dresses. She\r\nmoved quietly, but deadly efficiency, and in three-quarters of an\r\nhour her trunk was locked and strapped and she was fully dressed\r\nin a becoming new travelling suit that Marjorie had helped her\r\npick out.\r\n\r\nSitting down at her desk she wrote a short note to Mrs. Harvey,\r\nin which she briefly outlined her reasons for going. She sealed\r\nit, addressed it, and laid it on her pillow. She glanced at her\r\nwatch. The train left at one, and she knew that if she walked\r\ndown to the Marborough Hotel two blocks away she could easily get\r\na taxicab.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she drew in her breath sharply and an expression flashed\r\ninto her eyes that a practiced character reader might have\r\nconnected vaguely with the set look she had worn in the barber\'s\r\nchair--somehow a development of it. It was quite a new look for\r\nBernice--and it carried consequences.\r\n\r\nShe went stealthily to the bureau, picked up an article that lay\r\nthere, and turning out all the lights stood quietly until her\r\neyes became accustomed to the darkness. Softly she pushed open\r\nthe door to Marjorie\'s room. She heard the quiet, even breathing\r\nof an untroubled conscience asleep.\r\n\r\nShe was by the bedside now, very deliberate and calm. She acted\r\nswiftly. Bending over she found one of the braids of Marjorie\'s\r\nhair, followed it up with her hand to the point nearest the head,\r\nand then holding it a little slack so that the sleeper would\r\nfeel no pull, she reached down with the shears and severed it.\r\nWith the pigtail in her hand she held her breath. Marjorie had\r\nmuttered something in her sleep. Bernice deftly amputated the\r\nother braid, paused for an instant, and then flitted swiftly and\r\nsilently back to her own room.\r\n\r\nDown-stairs she opened the big front door, closed it carefully\r\nbehind her, and feeling oddly happy and exuberant stepped off the\r\nporch into the moonlight, swinging her heavy grip like a\r\nshopping-bag. After a minute\'s brisk walk she discovered that her\r\nleft hand still held the two blond braids. She laughed\r\nunexpectedly--had to shut her mouth hard to keep from emitting an\r\nabsolute peal. She was passing Warren\'s house now, and on the\r\nimpulse she set down her baggage, and swinging the braids like\r\npiece of rope flung them at the wooden porch, where they landed\r\nwith a slight thud. She laughed again, no longer restraining\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"Huh," she giggled wildly. "Scalp the selfish thing!"\r\n\r\nThen picking up her staircase she set off at a half-run down the\r\nmoonlit street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenediction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore Station was hot and crowded, so Lois was forced to\r\nstand by the telegraph desk for interminable, sticky seconds\r\nwhile a clerk with big front teeth counted and recounted a large\r\nlady\'s day message, to determine whether it contained the\r\ninnocuous forty-nine words or the fatal fifty-one.\r\n\r\nLois, waiting, decided she wasn\'t quite sure of the address, so\r\nshe took the letter out of her bag and ran over it again.\r\n\r\n"Darling," IT BEGAN--"I understand and I\'m happier than life ever\r\nmeant me to be. If I could give you the things you\'ve always\r\nbeen in tune with--but I can\'t Lois; we can\'t marry and we can\'t\r\nlose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing.\r\n\r\n"Until your letter came, dear, I\'d been sitting here in the half\r\ndark and thinking where I could go and ever forget you; abroad,\r\nperhaps, to drift through Italy or Spain and dream away the pain\r\nof having lost you where the crumbling ruins of older, mellower\r\ncivilizations would mirror only the desolation of my heart--and\r\nthen your letter came.\r\n\r\n"Sweetest, bravest girl, if you\'ll wire me I\'ll meet you in\r\nWilmington--till then I\'ll be here just waiting and hoping for\r\nevery long dream of you to come true.\r\n                                           "Howard."\r\n\r\nShe had read the letter so many times that she knew it word by\r\nword, yet it still startled her. In it she found many faint\r\nreflections of the man who wrote it--the mingled sweetness and\r\nsadness in his dark eyes, the furtive, restless excitement she\r\nfelt sometimes when he talked to her, his dreamy sensuousness\r\nthat lulled her mind to sleep. Lois was nineteen and very\r\nromantic and curious and courageous.\r\n\r\nThe large lady and the clerk having compromised on fifty words,\r\nLois took a blank and wrote her telegram. And there were no\r\novertones to the finality of her decision.\r\n\r\nIt\'s just destiny--she thought--it\'s just the way things work\r\nout in this damn world. If cowardice is all that\'s been holding\r\nme back there won\'t be any more holding back. So we\'ll just let\r\nthings take their course and never be sorry.\r\n\r\nThe clerk scanned her telegram:\r\n\r\n"Arrived Baltimore today spend day with my brother meet me\r\nWilmington three P.M. Wednesday\r\nLove\r\n\r\n                                      "Lois."\r\n\r\n"Fifty-four cents," said the clerk admiringly.\r\n\r\nAnd never be sorry--thought Lois--and never be sorry---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees filtering light onto dapple grass. Trees like tall, languid\r\nladies with feather fans coquetting airily with the ugly roof of\r\nthe monastery. Trees like butlers, bending courteously over\r\nplacid walks and paths. Trees, trees over the hills on either\r\nside and scattering out in clumps and lines and woods all through\r\neastern Maryland, delicate lace on the hems of many yellow\r\nfields, dark opaque backgrounds for flowered bushes or wild\r\nclimbing garden.\r\n\r\nSome of the trees were very gay and young, but the monastery\r\ntrees were older than the monastery which, by true monastic\r\nstandards, wasn\'t very old at all. And, as a matter of fact, it\r\nwasn\'t technically called a monastery, but only a seminary;\r\nnevertheless it shall be a monastery here despite its Victorian\r\narchitecture or its Edward VII additions, or even its Woodrow\r\nWilsonian, patented, last-a-century roofing.\r\n\r\nOut behind was the farm where half a dozen lay brothers were\r\nsweating lustily as they moved with deadly efficiency around the\r\nvegetable-gardens. To the left, behind a row of elms, was an\r\ninformal baseball diamond where three novices were being batted\r\nout by a fourth, amid great chasings and puffings and blowings.\r\nAnd in front as a great mellow bell boomed the half-hour a swarm\r\nof black, human leaves were blown over the checker-board of paths\r\nunder the courteous trees.\r\n\r\nSome of these black leaves were very old with cheeks furrowed\r\nlike the first ripples of a splashed pool. Then there was a\r\nscattering of middle-aged leaves whose forms when viewed in\r\nprofile in their revealing gowns were beginning to be faintly\r\nunsymmetrical. These carried thick volumes of Thomas Aquinas and\r\nHenry James and Cardinal Mercier and Immanuel Kant and many\r\nbulging note-books filled with lecture data.\r\n\r\nBut most numerous were the young leaves; blond boys of nineteen\r\nwith very stern, conscientious expressions; men in the late\r\ntwenties with a keen self-assurance from having taught out in the\r\nworld for five years--several hundreds of them, from city and\r\ntown and country in Maryland and Pennsylvania and Virginia and\r\nWest Virginia and Delaware.\r\n\r\nThere were many Americans and some Irish and some tough Irish and\r\na few French, and several Italians and Poles, and they walked\r\ninformally arm in arm with each other in twos and threes or in\r\nlong rows, almost universally distinguished by the straight mouth\r\nand the considerable chin--for this was the Society of Jesus,\r\nfounded in Spain five hundred years before by a tough-minded\r\nsoldier who trained men to hold a breach or a salon, preach a\r\nsermon or write a treaty, and do it and not argue . . .\r\n\r\nLois got out of a bus into the sunshine down by the outer gate.\r\nShe was nineteen with yellow hair and eyes that people were\r\ntactful enough not to call green. When men of talent saw her in a\r\nstreet-car they often furtively produced little stub-pencils and\r\nbacks of envelopes and tried to sum up that profile or the thing\r\nthat the eyebrows did to her eyes. Later they looked at their\r\nresults and usually tore them up with wondering sighs.\r\n\r\nThough Lois was very jauntily attired in an expensively\r\nappropriate travelling affair, she did not linger to pat out the\r\ndust which covered her clothes, but started up the central walk\r\nwith curious glances at either side. Her face was very eager and\r\nexpectant, yet she hadn\'t at all that glorified expression that\r\ngirls wear when they arrive for a Senior Prom at Princeton or New\r\nHaven; still, as there were no senior proms here, perhaps it\r\ndidn\'t matter.\r\n\r\nShe was wondering what he would look like, whether she\'d possibly\r\nknow him from his picture. In the picture, which hung over her\r\nmother\'s bureau at home, he seemed very young and hollow-cheeked\r\nand rather pitiful, with only a well-developed mouth and all\r\nill-fitting probationer\'s gown to show that he had already made a\r\nmomentous decision about his life. Of course he had been only\r\nnineteen then and now he was thirty-six--didn\'t look like that at\r\nall; in recent snap-shots he was much broader and his hair had\r\ngrown a little thin--but the impression of her brother she had\r\nalways retained was that of the big picture. And so she had\r\nalways been a little sorry for him. What a life for a man!\r\nSeventeen years of preparation and he wasn\'t even a priest\r\nyet--wouldn\'t be for another year.\r\n\r\nLois had an idea that this was all going to be rather solemn if\r\nshe let it be. But she was going to give her very best imitation\r\nof undiluted sunshine, the imitation she could give even when her\r\nhead was splitting or when her mother had a nervous breakdown or\r\nwhen she was particularly romantic and curious and courageous.\r\nThis brother of hers undoubtedly needed cheering up, and he was\r\ngoing to be cheered up, whether he liked it or not.\r\n\r\nAs she drew near the great, homely front door she saw a man break\r\nsuddenly away from a group and, pulling up the skirts of his\r\ngown, run toward her. He was smiling, she noticed, and he looked\r\nvery big and--and reliable. She stopped and waited, knew that her\r\nheart was beating unusually fast.\r\n\r\n"Lois!" he cried, and in a second she was in his arms. She was\r\nsuddenly trembling.\r\n\r\n"Lois!" he cried again, "why, this is wonderful! I can\'t tell\r\nyou, Lois, how MUCH I\'ve looked forward to this. Why, Lois,\r\nyou\'re beautiful!"\r\n\r\nLois gasped.\r\n\r\nHis voice, though restrained, was vibrant with energy and that\r\nodd sort of enveloping personality she had thought that she only\r\nof the family possessed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty glad, too--Kieth."\r\n\r\nShe flushed, but not unhappily, at this first use of his name.\r\n\r\n"Lois--Lois--Lois," he repeated in wonder. "Child, we\'ll go in\r\nhere a minute, because I want you to meet the rector, and then\r\nwe\'ll walk around. I have a thousand things to talk to you\r\nabout."\r\n\r\nHis voice became graver. "How\'s mother?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a moment and then said something that she\r\nhad not intended to say at all, the very sort of thing she had\r\nresolved to avoid.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Kieth--she\'s--she\'s getting worse all the time, every way."\r\n\r\nHe nodded slowly as if he understood.\r\n\r\n"Nervous, well--you can tell me about that later. Now---"\r\n\r\nShe was in a small study with a large desk, saying something to a\r\nlittle, jovial, white-haired priest who retained her hand for\r\nsome seconds.\r\n\r\n"So this is Lois!"\r\n\r\nHe said it as if he had heard of her for years.\r\n\r\nHe entreated her to sit down.\r\n\r\nTwo other priests arrived enthusiastically and shook hands with\r\nher and addressed her as "Kieth\'s little sister," which she found\r\nshe didn\'t mind a bit.\r\n\r\nHow assured they seemed; she had expected a certain shyness,\r\nreserve at least. There were several jokes unintelligible to her,\r\nwhich seemed to delight every one, and the little Father Rector\r\nreferred to the trio of them as "dim old monks," which she\r\nappreciated, because of course they weren\'t monks at all. She had\r\na lightning impression that they were especially fond of\r\nKieth--the Father Rector had called him "Kieth" and one of the\r\nothers had kept a hand on his shoulder all through the\r\nconversation. Then she was shaking hands again and promising to\r\ncome back a little later for some ice-cream, and smiling and\r\nsmiling and being rather absurdly happy . . . she told herself\r\nthat it was because Kieth was so delighted in showing her off.\r\n\r\nThen she and Kieth were strolling along a path, arm in arm, and\r\nhe was informing her what an absolute jewel the Father Rector\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"Lois," he broke off suddenly, "I want to tell you before we go\r\nany farther how much it means to me to have you come up here. I\r\nthink it was--mighty sweet of you. I know what a gay time you\'ve\r\nbeen having."\r\n\r\nLois gasped. She was not prepared for this. At first when she had\r\nconceived the plan of taking the hot journey down to Baltimore\r\nstaying the night with a friend and then coming out to see her\r\nbrother, she had felt rather consciously virtuous, hoped he\r\nwouldn\'t be priggish or resentful about her not having come\r\nbefore--but walking here with him under the trees seemed such a\r\nlittle thing, and surprisingly a happy thing.\r\n\r\n"Why, Kieth," she said quickly, "you know I couldn\'t have waited\r\na day longer. I saw you when I was five, but of course I didn\'t\r\nremember, and how could I have gone on without practically ever\r\nhaving seen my only brother?"\r\n\r\n"It was mighty sweet of you, Lois," he repeated.\r\n\r\nLois blushed--he DID have personality.\r\n\r\n"I want you to tell me all about yourself," he said after a\r\npause. "Of course I have a general idea what you and mother did\r\nin Europe those fourteen years, and then we were all so worried,\r\nLois, when you had pneumonia and couldn\'t come down with\r\nmother--let\'s see that was two years ago--and then, well, I\'ve\r\nseen your name in the papers, but it\'s all been so\r\nunsatisfactory. I haven\'t known you, Lois."\r\n\r\nShe found herself analyzing his personality as she analyzed the\r\npersonality of every man she met. She wondered if the effect\r\nof--of intimacy that he gave was bred by his constant repetition\r\nof her name. He said it as if he loved the word, as if it had an\r\ninherent meaning to him.\r\n\r\n"Then you were at school," he continued.\r\n\r\n"Yes, at Farmington. Mother wanted me to go to a convent--but I\r\ndidn\'t want to."\r\n\r\nShe cast a side glance at him to see if he would resent this.\r\n\r\nBut he only nodded slowly.\r\n\r\n"Had enough convents abroad, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and Kieth, convents are different there anyway. Here even\r\nin the nicest ones there are so many COMMON girls."\r\n\r\nHe nodded again.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he agreed, "I suppose there are, and I know how you feel\r\nabout it. It grated on me here, at first, Lois, though I wouldn\'t\r\nsay that to any one but you; we\'re rather sensitive, you and I,\r\nto things like this."\r\n\r\n"You mean the men here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, some of them of course were fine, the sort of men I\'d\r\nalways been thrown with, but there were others; a man named\r\nRegan, for instance--I hated the fellow, and now he\'s about the\r\nbest friend I have. A wonderful character, Lois; you\'ll meet him\r\nlater. Sort of man you\'d like to have with you in a fight."\r\n\r\nLois was thinking that Kieth was the sort of man she\'d like to\r\nhave with HER in a fight.\r\n\r\n"How did you--how did you first happen to do it?" she asked,\r\nrather shyly, "to come here, I mean. Of course mother told me the\r\nstory about the Pullman car."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that---" He looked rather annoyed.\r\n\r\n"Tell me that. I\'d like to hear you tell it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s nothing except what you probably know. It was evening\r\nand I\'d been riding all day and thinking about--about a hundred\r\nthings, Lois, and then suddenly I had a sense that some one was\r\nsitting across from me, felt that he\'d been there for some time,\r\nand had a vague idea that he was another traveller. All at once\r\nhe leaned over toward me and I heard a voice say: \'I want you to\r\nbe a priest, that\'s what I want.\' Well I jumped up and cried out,\r\n\'Oh, my God, not that!\'--made an idiot of myself before about\r\ntwenty people; you see there wasn\'t any one sitting there at all.\r\nA week after that I went to the Jesuit College in Philadelphia\r\nand crawled up the last flight of stairs to the rector\'s office\r\non my hands and knees."\r\n\r\nThere was another silence and Lois saw that her brother\'s eyes\r\nwore a far-away look, that he was staring unseeingly out over the\r\nsunny fields. She was stirred by the modulations of his voice\r\nand the sudden silence that seemed to flow about him when he\r\nfinished speaking.\r\n\r\nShe noticed now that his eyes were of the same fibre as hers,\r\nwith the green left out, and that his mouth was much gentler,\r\nreally, than in the picture--or was it that the face had grown\r\nup to it lately? He was getting a little bald just on top of his\r\nhead. She wondered if that was from wearing a hat so much. It\r\nseemed awful for a man to grow bald and no one to care about it.\r\n\r\n"Were you--pious when you were young, Kieth?" she asked. "You\r\nknow what I mean. Were you religious? If you don\'t mind these\r\npersonal questions."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said with his eyes still far away--and she felt that\r\nhis intense abstraction was as much a part of his personality as\r\nhis attention. "Yes, I suppose I was, when I was--sober."\r\n\r\nLois thrilled slightly.\r\n\r\n"Did you drink?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n"I was on the way to making a bad hash of things." He smiled and,\r\nturning his gray eyes on her, changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"Child, tell me about mother. I know it\'s been awfully hard for\r\nyou there, lately. I know you\'ve had to sacrifice a lot and put\r\nup with a great deal and I want you to know how fine of you I\r\nthink it is. I feel, Lois, that you\'re sort of taking the place\r\nof both of us there."\r\n\r\nLois thought quickly how little she had sacrificed; how lately\r\nshe had constantly avoided her nervous, half-invalid mother.\r\n\r\n"Youth shouldn\'t be sacrificed to age, Kieth," she said steadily.\r\n\r\n"I know," he sighed, "and you oughtn\'t to have the weight on\r\nyour shoulders, child. I wish I were there to help you."\r\n\r\nShe saw how quickly he had turned her remark and instantly she\r\nknew what this quality was that he gave off. He was SWEET. Her\r\nthoughts went of on a side-track and then she broke the silence\r\nwith an odd remark.\r\n\r\n"Sweetness is hard," she said suddenly.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," she denied in confusion. "I didn\'t mean to speak\r\naloud. I was thinking of something--of a conversation with a man\r\nnamed Freddy Kebble."\r\n\r\n"Maury Kebble\'s brother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said rather surprised to think of him having known\r\nMaury Kebble. Still there was nothing strange about it. "Well, he\r\nand I were talking about sweetness a few weeks ago. Oh, I don\'t\r\nknow--I said that a man named Howard--that a man I knew was\r\nsweet, and he didn\'t agree with me, and we began talking about\r\nwhat sweetness in a man was: He kept telling me I meant a sort of\r\nsoppy softness, but I knew I didn\'t--yet I didn\'t know exactly\r\nhow to put it. I see now. I meant just the opposite. I suppose\r\nreal sweetness is a sort of hardness--and strength."\r\n\r\nKieth nodded.\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean. I\'ve known old priests who had it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m talking about young men," she said rather defiantly.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the now deserted baseball diamond and, pointing\r\nher to a wooden bench, he sprawled full length on the grass.\r\n\r\n"Are these YOUNG men happy here, Kieth?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they look happy, Lois?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so, but those YOUNG ones, those two we just\r\npassed--have they--are they---?\r\n\r\n"Are they signed up?" he laughed. "No, but they will be next\r\nmonth."\r\n\r\n"Permanently?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--unless they break down mentally or physically. Of course in\r\na discipline like ours a lot drop out."\r\n\r\n"But those BOYS. Are they giving up fine chances outside--like\r\nyou did?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Some of them."\r\n\r\n"But Kieth, they don\'t know what they\'re doing. They haven\'t had\r\nany experience of what they\'re missing."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t seem fair. Life has just sort of scared them at\r\nfirst. Do they all come in so YOUNG?"\r\n\r\n"No, some of them have knocked around, led pretty wild\r\nlives--Regan, for instance."\r\n\r\n"I should think that sort would be better," she said\r\nmeditatively, "men that had SEEN life."\r\n\r\n"No," said Kieth earnestly, "I\'m not sure that knocking about\r\ngives a man the sort of experience he can communicate to others.\r\nSome of the broadest men I\'ve known have been absolutely rigid\r\nabout themselves. And reformed libertines are a notoriously\r\nintolerant class. Don\'t you thank so, Lois?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, still meditative, and he continued:\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that when one weak reason goes to another, it\r\nisn\'t help they want; it\'s a sort of companionship in guilt,\r\nLois. After you were born, when mother began to get nervous she\r\nused to go and weep with a certain Mrs. Comstock. Lord, it used\r\nto make me shiver. She said it comforted her, poor old mother.\r\nNo, I don\'t think that to help others you\'ve got to show yourself\r\nat all. Real help comes from a stronger person whom you respect.\r\nAnd their sympathy is all the bigger because it\'s impersonal."\r\n\r\n"But people want human sympathy," objected Lois. "They want to\r\nfeel the other person\'s been tempted."\r\n\r\n"Lois, in their hearts they want to feel that the other person\'s\r\nbeen weak. That\'s what they mean by human.\r\n\r\n"Here in this old monkery, Lois," he continued with a smile, "they\r\ntry to get all that self-pity and pride in our own wills out of\r\nus right at the first. They put us to scrubbing floors--and other\r\nthings. It\'s like that idea of saving your life by losing it.\r\nYou see we sort of feel that the less human a man is, in your\r\nsense of human, the better servant he can be to humanity. We\r\ncarry it out to the end, too. When one of us dies his family\r\ncan\'t even have him then. He\'s buried here under plain wooden\r\ncross with a thousand others."\r\n\r\nHis tone changed suddenly and he looked at her with a great\r\nbrightness in his gray eyes.\r\n\r\n"But way back in a man\'s heart there are some things he can\'t get\r\nrid of--an one of them is that I\'m awfully in love with my\r\nlittle sister."\r\n\r\nWith a sudden impulse she knelt beside him in the grass and,\r\nLeaning over, kissed his forehead.\r\n\r\n"You\'re hard, Kieth," she said, "and I love you for it--and\r\nyou\'re sweet."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in the reception-room Lois met a half-dozen more of Kieth\'s\r\nparticular friends; there was a young man named Jarvis, rather\r\npale and delicate-looking, who, she knew, must be a grandson of\r\nold Mrs. Jarvis at home, and she mentally compared this ascetic\r\nwith a brace of his riotous uncles.\r\n\r\nAnd there was Regan with a scarred face and piercing intent eyes\r\nthat followed her about the room and often rested on Kieth with\r\nsomething very like worship.  She knew then what Kieth had meant\r\nabout "a good man to have with you in a fight."\r\n\r\nHe\'s the missionary type--she thought vaguely--China or something.\r\n\r\n"I want Kieth\'s sister to show us what the shimmy is," demanded\r\none young man with a broad grin.\r\n\r\nLois laughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid the Father Rector would send me shimmying out the\r\ngate. Besides, I\'m not an expert."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it wouldn\'t be best for Jimmy\'s soul anyway," said\r\nKieth solemnly. "He\'s inclined to brood about things like\r\nshimmys. They were just starting to do the--maxixe, wasn\'t it,\r\nJimmy?--when he became a monk, and it haunted him his whole first\r\nyear. You\'d see him when he was peeling potatoes, putting his\r\narm around the bucket and making irreligious motions with his\r\nfeet."\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh in which Lois joined.\r\n\r\n"An old lady who comes here to Mass sent Kieth this ice-cream,"\r\nwhispered Jarvis under cover of the laugh, "because she\'d heard\r\nyou were coming. It\'s pretty good, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThere were tears trembling in Lois\' eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThen half an hour later over in the chapel things suddenly went\r\nall wrong. It was several years since Lois had been at\r\nBenediction and at first she was thrilled by the gleaming\r\nmonstrance with its central spot of white, the air rich and heavy\r\nwith incense, and the sun shining through the stained-glass\r\nwindow of St. Francis Xavier overhead and falling in warm red\r\ntracery on the cassock of the man in front of her, but at the\r\nfirst notes of the "O SALUTARIS HOSTIA" a heavy weight seemed to\r\ndescend upon her soul. Kieth was on her right and young Jarvis on\r\nher left, and she stole uneasy glance at both of them.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the matter with me? she thought impatiently.\r\n\r\nShe looked again. Was there a certain coldness in both their\r\nprofiles, that she had not noticed before--a pallor about the\r\nmouth and a curious set expression in their eyes? She shivered\r\nslightly: they were like dead men.\r\n\r\nShe felt her soul recede suddenly from Kieth\'s. This was her\r\nbrother--this, this unnatural person. She caught herself in the\r\nact of a little laugh.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with me?"\r\n\r\nShe passed her hand over her eyes and the weight increased. The\r\nincense sickened her and a stray, ragged note from one of the\r\ntenors in the choir grated on her ear like the shriek of a\r\nslate-pencil. She fidgeted, and raising her hand to her hair\r\ntouched her forehead, found moisture on it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hot in here, hot as the deuce."\r\n\r\nAgain she repressed a faint laugh and, then in an instant the\r\nweight on her heart suddenly diffused into cold fear. . . . It\r\nwas that candle on the altar. It was all wrong--wrong. Why didn\'t\r\nsomebody see it? There was something IN it. There was something\r\ncoming out of it, taking form and shape above it.\r\n\r\nShe tried to fight down her rising panic, told herself it was the\r\nwick. If the wick wasn\'t straight, candles did something--but\r\nthey didn\'t do this! With incalculable rapidity a force was\r\ngathering within her, a tremendous, assimilative force, drawing\r\nfrom every sense, every corner of her brain, and as it surged up\r\ninside her she felt an enormous terrified repulsion. She drew her\r\narms in close to her side away from Kieth and Jarvis.\r\n\r\nSomething in that candle . . . she was leaning forward--in\r\nanother moment she felt she would go forward toward it--didn\'t\r\nany one see it? . . . anyone?\r\n\r\n"Ugh!"\r\n\r\nShe felt a space beside her and something told her that Jarvis\r\nhad gasped and sat down very suddenly . . . then she was kneeling\r\nand as the flaming monstrance slowly left the altar in the hands\r\nof the priest, she heard a great rushing noise in her ears--the\r\ncrash of the bells was like hammer-blows . . . and then in a\r\nmoment that seemed eternal a great torrent rolled over her\r\nheart--there was a shouting there and a lashing as of waves . . .\r\n\r\n. . . She was calling, felt herself calling for Kieth, her lips\r\nmouthing the words that would not come:\r\n\r\n"Kieth! Oh, my God! KIETH!"\r\n\r\nSuddenly she became aware of a new presence, something external,\r\nin front of her, consummated and expressed in warm red tracery.\r\nThen she knew. It was the window of St. Francis Xavier. Her mind\r\ngripped at it, clung to it finally, and she felt herself calling\r\nagain endlessly, impotently--Kieth--Kieth!\r\n\r\nThen out of a great stillness came a voice:\r\n\r\n"BLESSED BE GOD."\r\n\r\nWith a gradual rumble sounded the response rolling heavily\r\nthrough the chapel:\r\n\r\n"Blessed be God."\r\n\r\nThe words sang instantly in her heart; the incense lay mystically\r\nand sweetly peaceful upon the air, and THE CANDLE ON THE ALTAR\r\nWENT OUT.\r\n\r\n"Blessed be His Holy Name."\r\n\r\n"Blessed be His Holy Name."\r\n\r\nEverything blurred into a swinging mist. With a sound half-gasp,\r\nhalf-cry she rocked on her feet and reeled backward into Kieth\'s\r\nsuddenly outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n"Lie still, child."\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes again. She was on the grass outside, pillowed\r\non Kieth\'s arm, and Regan was dabbing her head with a cold towel.\r\n\r\n"I\'m all right," she said quietly.\r\n\r\n"I know, but just lie still a minute longer. It was too hot in\r\nthere. Jarvis felt it, too."\r\n\r\nShe laughed as Regan again touched her gingerly with the towel.\r\n\r\n"I\'m all right," she repeated.\r\n\r\nBut though a warm peace was falling her mind and heart she felt\r\noddly broken and chastened, as if some one had held her stripped\r\nsoul up and laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later she walked leaning on Kieth\'s arm down the\r\nlong central path toward the gate.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been such a short afternoon," he sighed, "and I\'m so sorry\r\nyou were sick, Lois."\r\n\r\n"Kieth, I\'m feeling fine now, really; I wish you wouldn\'t worry."\r\n\r\n"Poor old child. I didn\'t realize that Benediction\'d be a long\r\nservice for you after your hot trip out here and all."\r\n\r\nShe laughed cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"I guess the truth is I\'m not much used to Benediction. Mass is\r\nthe limit of my religious exertions."\r\n\r\nShe paused and then continued quickly:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to shock you, Kieth, but I can\'t tell you how--how\r\nINCONVENIENT being a Catholic is. It really doesn\'t seem to apply\r\nany more. As far as morals go, some of the wildest boys I know\r\nare Catholics. And the brightest boys--I mean the ones who think\r\nand read a lot, don\'t seem to believe in much of anything any\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about it. The bus won\'t be here for another half-hour."\r\n\r\nThey sat down on a bench by the path.\r\n\r\n"For instance, Gerald Carter, he\'s published a novel. He\r\nabsolutely roars when people mention immortality. And then\r\nHowa--well, another man I\'ve known well, lately, who was Phi Beta\r\nKappa at Harvard says that no intelligent person can believe in\r\nSupernatural Christianity. He says Christ was a great socialist,\r\nthough. Am I shocking you?"\r\n\r\nShe broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\nKieth smiled.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t shock a monk. He\'s a professional shock-absorber."\r\n\r\n"Well," she continued, "that\'s about all. It seems so--so NARROW.\r\nChurch schools, for instance. There\'s more freedom about things\r\nthat Catholic people can\'t see--like birth control."\r\n\r\nKieth winced, almost imperceptibly, but Lois saw it.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said quickly, "everybody talks about everything now."\r\n\r\n"It\'s probably better that way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, much better. Well, that\'s all, Kieth. I just wanted to\r\ntell you why I\'m a little--luke-warm, at present."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not shocked, Lois. I understand better than you think. We\r\nall go through those times. But I know it\'ll come out all right,\r\nchild. There\'s that gift of faith that we have, you and I,\r\nthat\'ll carry us past the bad spots."\r\n\r\nHe rose as he spoke and they started again down the path.\r\n\r\n"I want you to pray for me sometimes, Lois. I think your prayers\r\nwould be about what I need. Because we\'ve come very close in\r\nthese few hours, I think."\r\n\r\nHer eyes were suddenly shining.\r\n\r\n"Oh we have, we have!" she cried. "I feel closer to you now than\r\nto any one in the world."\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly and indicated the side of the path.\r\n\r\n"We might--just a minute---"\r\n\r\nIt was a piet\xe0, a life-size statue of the Blessed Virgin set\r\nwithin a semicircle of rocks.\r\n\r\nFeeling a little self-conscious she dropped on her knees beside\r\nhim and made an unsuccessful attempt at prayer.\r\n\r\nShe was only half through when he rose. He took her arm again.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to thank Her for letting as have this day together," he\r\nsaid simply.\r\n\r\nLois felt a sudden lump in her throat and she wanted to say\r\nsomething that would tell him how much it had meant to her, too.\r\nBut she found no words.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll always remember this," he continued, his voice trembling a\r\nlittle---"this summer day with you. It\'s been just what I\r\nexpected. You\'re just what I expected, Lois."\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully glad, Keith."\r\n\r\n"You see, when you were little they kept sending me snap-shots of\r\nyou, first as a baby and then as a child in socks playing on the\r\nbeach with a pail and shovel, and then suddenly as a wistful\r\nlittle girl with wondering, pure eyes--and I used to build dreams\r\nabout you. A man has to have something living to cling to. I\r\nthink, Lois, it was your little white soul I tried to keep near\r\nme--even when life was at its loudest and every intellectual idea\r\nof God seemed the sheerest mockery, and desire and love and a\r\nmillion things came up to me and said: \'Look here at me! See, I\'m\r\nLife. You\'re turning your back on it!\' All the way through that\r\nshadow, Lois, I could always see your baby soul flitting on ahead\r\nof me, very frail and clear and wonderful."\r\n\r\nLois was crying softly. They had reached the gate and she rested\r\nher elbow on it and dabbed furiously at her eyes.\r\n\r\n"And then later, child, when you were sick I knelt all one night\r\nand asked God to spare you for me--for I knew then that I wanted\r\nmore; He had taught me to want more. I wanted to know you moved\r\nand breathed in the same world with me. I saw you growing up,\r\nthat white innocence of yours changing to a flame and burning to\r\ngive light to other weaker souls. And then I wanted some day to\r\ntake your children on my knee and hear them call the crabbed old\r\nmonk Uncle Kieth."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be laughing now as he talked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lois, Lois, I was asking God for more then. I wanted the\r\nletters you\'d write me and the place I\'d have at your table. I\r\nwanted an awful lot, Lois, dear."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got me, Kieth," she sobbed "you know it, say you know it.\r\nOh, I\'m acting like a baby but I didn\'t think you\'d be this way,\r\nand I--oh, Kieth--Kieth---"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and patted it softly.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the bus. You\'ll come again won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nShe put her hands on his cheeks, add drawing his head down,\r\npressed her tear-wet face against his.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Kieth, brother, some day I\'ll tell you something."\r\n\r\nHe helped her in, saw her take down her handkerchief and smile\r\nbravely at him, as the driver kicked his whip and the bus rolled\r\noff. Then a thick cloud of dust rose around it and she was gone.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes he stood there on the road his hand on the\r\ngate-post, his lips half parted in a smile.\r\n\r\n"Lois," he said aloud in a sort of wonder, "Lois, Lois."\r\n\r\nLater, some probationers passing noticed him kneeling before the\r\npiet\xe0, and coming back after a time found him still there. And he\r\nwas there until twilight came down and the courteous trees grew\r\ngarrulous overhead and the crickets took up their burden of song\r\nin the dusky grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first clerk in the telegraph booth in the Baltimore Station\r\nwhistled through his buck teeth at the second clerk:\r\n\r\n"S\'matter?"\r\n\r\n"See that girl--no, the pretty one with the big black dots on her\r\nveil. Too late--she\'s gone. You missed somep\'n."\r\n\r\n"What about her?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. \'Cept she\'s damn good-looking. Came in here yesterday\r\nand sent a wire to some guy to meet her somewhere. Then a minute\r\nago she came in with a telegram all written out and was standin\'\r\nthere goin\' to give it to me when she changed her mind or somep\'n\r\nand all of a sudden tore it up."\r\n\r\n"Hm."\r\n\r\nThe first clerk came around tile counter and picking up the two\r\npieces of paper from the floor put them together idly. The second\r\nclerk read them over his shoulder and subconsciously counted the\r\nwords as he read. There were just thirteen.\r\n\r\n"This is in the way of a permanent goodbye. I should suggest\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n                                                      "Lois."\r\n\r\n"Tore it up, eh?" said the second clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDalyrimple Goes Wrong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the millennium an educational genius will write a book to be\r\ngiven to every young man on the date of his disillusion. This\r\nwork will have the flavor of Montaigne\'s essays and Samuel\r\nButler\'s note-books--and a little of Tolstoi and Marcus\r\nAurelius. It will be neither cheerful nor pleasant but will\r\ncontain numerous passages of striking humor. Since first-class\r\nminds never believe anything very strongly until they\'ve\r\nexperienced it, its value will be purely relative . . . all\r\npeople over thirty will refer to it as "depressing."\r\n\r\nThis prelude belongs to the story of a young man\r\nwho lived, as you and I do, before the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generation which numbered Bryan Dalyrimple drifted out of\r\nadolescence to a mighty fan-fare of trumpets. Bryan played the\r\nstar in an affair which included a Lewis gun and a nine-day romp\r\nbehind the retreating German lines, so luck triumphant or\r\nsentiment rampant awarded him a row of medals and on his arrival\r\nin the States he was told that he was second in importance only\r\nto General Pershing and Sergeant York. This was a lot of fun.\r\nThe governor of his State, a stray congressman, and a citizens\'\r\ncommittee gave him enormous smiles and "By God, Sirs" on the\r\ndock at Hoboken; there were newspaper reporters and\r\nphotographers who said "would you mind" and "if you could just";\r\nand back in his home town there were old ladies, the rims of\r\nwhose eyes grew red as they talked to him, and girls who hadn\'t\r\nremembered him so well since his father\'s business went blah! in\r\nnineteen-twelve.\r\n\r\nBut when the shouting died he realized that for a month he had\r\nbeen the house guest of the mayor, that he had only fourteen\r\ndollars in the world and that "the name that will live forever\r\nin the annals and legends of this State" was already living\r\nthere very quietly and obscurely.\r\n\r\nOne morning he lay late in bed and just outside his door he\r\nheard the up-stairs maid talking to the cook. The up-stairs maid\r\nsaid that Mrs. Hawkins, the mayor\'s wife, had been trying for a\r\nweek to hint Dalyrimple out of the house. He left at eleven\r\no\'clock in intolerable confusion, asking that his trunk be sent\r\nto Mrs. Beebe\'s boarding-house.\r\n\r\nDalyrimple was twenty-three and he had never worked. His father\r\nhad given him two years at the State University and passed away\r\nabout the time of his son\'s nine-day romp, leaving behind him\r\nsome mid-Victorian furniture and a thin packet of folded paper\r\nthat turned out to be grocery bills. Young Dalyrimple had very\r\nkeen gray eyes, a mind that delighted the army psychological\r\nexaminers, a trick of having read it--whatever it was--some time\r\nbefore, and a cool hand in a hot situation. But these things did\r\nnot save him a final, unresigned sigh when he realized that he\r\nhad to go to work--right away.\r\n\r\nIt was early afternoon when he walked into the office of Theron\r\nG. Macy, who owned the largest wholesale grocery house in town.\r\nPlump, prosperous, wearing a pleasant but quite unhumorous\r\nsmile, Theron G. Macy greeted him warmly.\r\n\r\n"Well--how do, Bryan? What\'s on your mind?"\r\n\r\nTo Dalyrimple, straining with his admission, his own words, when\r\nthey came, sounded like an Arab beggar\'s whine for alms.\r\n\r\n"Why--this question of a job." ("This question of a job" seemed\r\nsomehow more clothed than just "a job.")\r\n\r\n"A job?" An almost imperceptible breeze blew across Mr. Macy\'s\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n"You see, Mr. Macy," continued Dalyrimple, "I feel I\'m wasting\r\ntime. I want to get started at something. I had several chances\r\nabout a month ago but they all seem to have--gone---"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see," interrupted Mr. Macy. "What were they?"\r\n\r\n"Well, just at the first the governor said something about a\r\nvacancy on his staff. I was sort of counting on that for a\r\nwhile, but I hear he\'s given it to Allen Gregg, you know, son of\r\nG. P. Gregg. He sort of forgot what he said to me--just talking,\r\nI guess."\r\n\r\n"You ought to push those things."\r\n\r\n"Then there was that engineering expedition, but they decided\r\nthey\'d have to have a man who knew hydraulics, so they couldn\'t\r\nuse me unless I paid my own way."\r\n\r\n"You had just a year at the university?"\r\n\r\n"Two. But I didn\'t take any science or mathematics. Well, the\r\nday the battalion paraded, Mr. Peter Jordan said something about\r\na vacancy in his store. I went around there to-day and I found\r\nhe meant a sort of floor-walker--and then you said something one\r\nday"--he paused and waited for the older man to take him up, but\r\nnoting only a minute wince continued--"about a position, so I\r\nthought I\'d come and see you."\r\n\r\n"There was a position," confessed Mr. Macy reluctantly, "but\r\nsince then we\'ve filled it." He cleared his throat again.\r\n"You\'ve waited quite a while."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose I did. Everybody told me there was no hurry--and\r\nI\'d had these various offers."\r\n\r\nMr. Macy delivered a paragraph on present-day opportunities\r\nwhich Dalyrimple\'s mind completely skipped.\r\n\r\n"Have you had any business experience?"\r\n\r\n"I worked on a ranch two summers as a rider."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," Mr. Macy disparaged this neatly, and then continued:\r\n"What do you think you\'re worth?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Well, Bryan, I tell you, I\'m willing to strain a point and give\r\nyou a chance."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple nodded.\r\n\r\n"Your salary won\'t be much. You\'ll start by learning the stock.\r\nThen you\'ll come in the office for a while. Then you\'ll go on\r\nthe road. When could you begin?"\r\n\r\n"How about to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"All right. Report to Mr. Hanson in the stock-room. He\'ll start\r\nyou off."\r\n\r\nHe continued to regard Dalyrimple steadily until the latter,\r\nrealizing that the interview was over, rose awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Macy, I\'m certainly much obliged."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right. Glad to help you, Bryan."\r\n\r\nAfter an irresolute moment, Dalyrimple found himself in the\r\nhall. His forehead was covered with perspiration, and the room\r\nhad not been hot.\r\n\r\n"Why the devil did I thank the son of a gun?" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Mr. Hanson informed him coldly of the necessity of\r\npunching the time-clock at seven every morning, and delivered\r\nhim for instruction into the hands of a fellow worker, one\r\nCharley Moore.\r\n\r\nCharley was twenty-six, with that faint musk of weakness hanging\r\nabout him that is often mistaken for the scent of evil. It took\r\nno psychological examiner to decide that he had drifted into\r\nindulgence and laziness as casually as he had drifted into life,\r\nand was to drift out. He was pale and his clothes stank of\r\nsmoke; he enjoyed burlesque shows, billiards, and Robert\r\nService, and was always looking back upon his last intrigue or\r\nforward to his next one. In his youth his taste had run to loud\r\nties, but now it seemed to have faded, like his vitality, and\r\nwas expressed in pale-lilac four-in-hands and indeterminate\r\ngray collars. Charley was listlessly struggling that losing\r\nstruggle against mental, moral, and physical an\xe6mia that takes\r\nplace ceaselessly on the lower fringe of the middle classes.\r\n\r\nThe first morning he stretched himself on a row of cereal\r\ncartons and carefully went over the limitations of the Theron\r\nG. Macy Company.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a piker organization. My Gosh! Lookit what they give me.\r\nI\'m quittin\' in a coupla months. Hell! Me stay with this bunch!"\r\n\r\nThe Charley Moores are always going to change jobs next month.\r\nThey do, once or twice in their careers, after which they sit\r\naround comparing their last job with the present one, to the\r\ninfinite disparagement of the latter.\r\n\r\n"What do you get?" asked Dalyrimple curiously.\r\n\r\n"Me? I get sixty." This rather defiantly.\r\n\r\n"Did you start at sixty?"\r\n\r\n"Me? No, I started at thirty-five. He told me he\'d put me on the\r\nroad after I learned the stock. That\'s what he tells \'em all."\r\n\r\n"How long\'ve you been here?" asked Dalyrimple with a sinking\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n"Me? Four years. My last year, too, you bet your boots."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple rather resented the presence of the store detective\r\nas he resented the time-clock, and he came into contact with him\r\nalmost immediately through the rule against smoking. This rule\r\nwas a thorn in his side. He was accustomed to his three or four\r\ncigarettes in a morning, and after three days without it he\r\nfollowed Charley Moore by a circuitous route up a flight of back\r\nstairs to a little balcony where they indulged in peace. But\r\nthis was not for long. One day in his second week the detective\r\nmet him in a nook of the stairs, on his descent, and told him\r\nsternly that next time he\'d be reported to Mr. Macy. Dalyrimple\r\nfelt like an errant schoolboy.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant facts came to his knowledge. There were\r\n"cave-dwellers" in the basement who had worked there for ten or\r\nfifteen years at sixty dollars a month, rolling barrels and\r\ncarrying boxes through damp, cement-walled corridors, lost in\r\nthat echoing half-darkness between seven and five-thirty and,\r\nlike himself, compelled several times a month to work until nine\r\nat night.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month he stood in line and received forty\r\ndollars. He pawned a cigarette-case and a pair of field-glasses\r\nand managed to live--to eat, sleep, and smoke. It was, however,\r\na narrow scrape; as the ways and means of economy were a closed\r\nbook to him and the second month brought no increase, he voiced\r\nhis alarm.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve got a drag with old Macy, maybe he\'ll raise you," was\r\nCharley\'s disheartening reply. "But he didn\'t raise ME till I\'d\r\nbeen here nearly two years."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to live," said Dalyrimple simply. "I could get more\r\npay as a laborer on the railroad but, Golly, I want to feel I\'m\r\nwhere there\'s a chance to get ahead."\r\n\r\nCharles shook his head sceptically and Mr. Macy\'s answer next\r\nday was equally unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nDalyrimple had gone to the office just before closing time.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Macy, I\'d like to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"Why--yes." The unhumorous smile appeared. The voice was faintly\r\nresentful.\r\n\r\n"I want to speak to you in regard to more salary."\r\n\r\nMr. Macy nodded.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said doubtfully, "I don\'t know exactly what you\'re\r\ndoing. I\'ll speak to Mr. Hanson."\r\n\r\nHe knew exactly what Dalyrimple was doing, and Dalyrimple knew\r\nhe knew.\r\n\r\n"I\'m in the stock-room--and, sir, while I\'m here I\'d like to\r\nask you how much longer I\'ll have to stay there."\r\n\r\n"Why--I\'m not sure exactly. Of course it takes some time to\r\nlearn the stock."\r\n\r\n"You told me two months when I started."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Well, I\'ll speak to Mr. Hanson."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple paused irresolute.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir."\r\n\r\nTwo days later he again appeared in the office with the result\r\nof a count that had been asked for by Mr. Hesse, the bookkeeper.\r\nMr. Hesse was engaged and Dalyrimple, waiting, began idly\r\nfingering in a ledger on the stenographer\'s desk.\r\n\r\nHalf unconsciously he turned a page--he caught sight of his name\r\n--it was a salary list:\r\n\r\n     Dalyrimple\r\n     Demming\r\n     Donahoe\r\n     Everett\r\n\r\nHis eyes stopped--\r\n\r\n     Everett.........................$60\r\n\r\nSo Tom Everett, Macy\'s weak-chinned nephew, had started at sixty\r\n--and in three weeks he had been out of the packing-room and\r\ninto the office.\r\n\r\nSo that was it! He was to sit and see man after man pushed over\r\nhim: sons, cousins, sons of friends, irrespective of their\r\ncapabilities, while HE was cast for a pawn, with "going on the\r\nroad" dangled before his eyes--put off with the stock remark:\r\n"I\'ll see; I\'ll look into it." At forty, perhaps, he would be a\r\nbookkeeper like old Hesse, tired, listless Hesse with a dull\r\nroutine for his stint and a dull background of boarding-house\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThis was a moment when a genii should have pressed into his\r\nhand the book for disillusioned young men. But the book has\r\nnot been written.\r\n\r\nA great protest swelling into revolt surged up in him. Ideas\r\nhalf forgotten, chaoticly perceived and assimilated, filled his\r\nmind. Get on--that was the rule of life--and that was all. How\r\nhe did it, didn\'t matter--but to be Hesse or Charley Moore.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t!" he cried aloud.\r\n\r\nThe bookkeeper and the stenographers looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\nFor a second Dalyrimple stared--then walked up to the desk.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s that data," he said brusquely. "I can\'t wait any longer."\r\n\r\nMr. Hesse\'s face expressed surprise.\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t matter what he did--just so he got out\r\nof this rut. In a dream he stepped from the elevator into the\r\nstock-room, and walking to an unused aisle, sat down on a box,\r\ncovering his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nHis brain was whirring with the frightful jar of discovering a\r\nplatitude for himself.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to get out of this," he said aloud and then repeated,\r\n"I\'ve got to get out"--and he didn\'t mean only out of Macy\'s\r\nwholesale house.\r\n\r\nWhen he left at five-thirty it was pouring rain, but he struck\r\noff in the opposite direction from his boarding-house, feeling,\r\nin the first cool moisture that oozed soggily through his old\r\nsuit, an odd exultation and freshness. He wanted a world that\r\nwas like walking through rain, even though he could not see far\r\nahead of him, but fate had put him in the world of Mr. Macy\'s\r\nfetid storerooms and corridors. At first merely the overwhelming\r\nneed of change took him, then half-plans began to formulate in\r\nhis imagination.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go East--to a big city--meet people--bigger people--people\r\nwho\'ll help me. Interesting work somewhere. My God, there MUST\r\nbe."\r\n\r\nWith sickening truth it occurred to him that his facility for\r\nmeeting people was limited. Of all places it was here in his own\r\ntown that he should be known, was known--famous--before the water\r\nof oblivion had rolled over him.\r\n\r\nYou had to cut corners, that was all. Pull--relationship--wealthy\r\nmarriages---\r\n\r\nFor several miles the continued reiteration of this preoccupied\r\nhim and then he perceived that the rain had become thicker and\r\nmore opaque in the heavy gray of twilight and that the houses\r\nwere falling away. The district of full blocks, then of big\r\nhouses, then of scattering little ones, passed and great sweeps\r\nof misty country opened out on both sides. It was hard walking\r\nhere. The sidewalk had given place to a dirt road, streaked with\r\nfurious brown rivulets that splashed and squashed around his\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nCutting corners--the words began to fall apart, forming curious\r\nphrasings--little illuminated pieces of themselves. They\r\nresolved into sentences, each of which had a strangely familiar\r\nring.\r\n\r\nCutting corners meant rejecting the old childhood principles\r\nthat success came from faithfulness to duty, that evil was\r\nnecessarily punished or virtue necessarily rewarded--that honest\r\npoverty was happier than corrupt riches.\r\n\r\nIt meant being hard.\r\n\r\nThis phrase appealed to him and he repeated it over and over.\r\nIt had to do somehow with Mr. Macy and Charley Moore--the\r\nattitudes, the methods of each of them.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and felt his clothes. He was drenched to the skin. He\r\nlooked about him and, selecting a place in the fence where a\r\ntree sheltered it, perched himself there.\r\n\r\nIn my credulous years--he thought--they told me that evil was a\r\nsort of dirty hue, just as definite as a soiled collar, but it\r\nseems to me that evil is only a manner of hard luck, or\r\nheredity-and-environment, or "being found out." It hides in the\r\nvacillations of dubs like Charley Moore as certainly as it does\r\nin the intolerance of Macy, and if it ever gets much more\r\ntangible it becomes merely an arbitrary label to paste on the\r\nunpleasant things in other people\'s lives.\r\n\r\nIn fact--he concluded--it isn\'t worth worrying over what\'s evil\r\nand what isn\'t. Good and evil aren\'t any standard to me--and\r\nthey can be a devil of a bad hindrance when I want something.\r\nWhen I want something bad enough, common sense tells me to go\r\nand take it--and not get caught.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly Dalyrimple knew what he wanted first. He\r\nwanted fifteen dollars to pay his overdue board bill.\r\n\r\nWith a furious energy he jumped from the fence, whipped off his\r\ncoat, and from its black lining cut with his knife a piece about\r\nfive inches square. He made two holes near its edge and then\r\nfixed it on his face, pulling his hat down to hold it in place.\r\nIt flapped grotesquely and then dampened and clung clung to his\r\nforehead and cheeks.\r\n\r\nNow . . . The twilight had merged to dripping dusk . . . black\r\nas pitch. He began to walk quickly back toward town, not waiting\r\nto remove the mask but watching the road with difficulty through\r\nthe jagged eye-holes. He was not conscious of any nervousness\r\n. . . the only tension was caused by a desire to do the thing as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nHe reached the first sidewalk, continued on until he saw a hedge\r\nfar from any lamp-post, and turned in behind it. Within a minute\r\nhe heard several series of footsteps--he waited--it was a woman\r\nand he held his breath until she passed . . . and then a man,\r\na laborer. The next passer, he felt, would be what he wanted\r\n. . . the laborer\'s footfalls died far up the drenched street\r\n. . . other steps grew nears grew suddenly louder.\r\n\r\nDalyrimple braced himself.\r\n\r\n"Put up your hands!"\r\n\r\nThe man stopped, uttered an absurd little grunt, and thrust\r\npudgy arms skyward.\r\n\r\nDalyrimple went through the waistcoat.\r\n\r\n"Now, you shrimp," he said, setting his hand suggestively to\r\nhis own hip pocket, "you run, and stamp--loud! If I hear your\r\nfeet stop I\'ll put a shot after you!"\r\n\r\nThen he stood there in sudden uncontrollable laughter as\r\naudibly frightened footsteps scurried away into the night.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he thrust the roll of bills into his pocket,\r\nsnatched off his mask, and running quickly across the street,\r\ndarted down an alley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, however Dalyrimple justified himself intellectually, he had\r\nmany bad moments in the weeks immediately following his decision.\r\nThe tremendous pressure of sentiment and inherited ambition kept\r\nraising riot with his attitude. He felt morally lonely.\r\n\r\nThe noon after his first venture he ate in a little lunch-room\r\nwith Charley Moore and, watching him unspread the paper, waited\r\nfor a remark about the hold-up of the day before. But either the\r\nhold-up was not mentioned or Charley wasn\'t interested. He\r\nturned listlessly to the sporting sheet, read Doctor Crane\'s\r\ncrop of seasoned bromides, took in an editorial on ambition with\r\nhis mouth slightly ajar, and then skipped to Mutt and Jeff.\r\n\r\nPoor Charley--with his faint aura of evil and his mind that\r\nrefused to focus, playing a lifeless solitaire with cast-off\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nYet Charley belonged on the other side of the fence. In him\r\ncould be stirred up all the flamings and denunciations of\r\nrighteousness; he would weep at a stage heroine\'s lost virtue,\r\nhe could become lofty and contemptuous at the idea of dishonor.\r\n\r\nOn my side, thought Dalyrimple, there aren\'t any resting-places;\r\na man who\'s a strong criminal is after the weak criminals as\r\nwell, so it\'s all guerilla warfare over here.\r\n\r\nWhat will it all do to me? he thought with a persistent\r\nweariness. Will it take the color out of life with the honor?\r\nWill it scatter my courage and dull my mind?--despiritualize me\r\ncompletely--does it mean eventual barrenness, eventual remorse,\r\nfailure?\r\n\r\nWith a great surge of anger, he would fling his mind upon the\r\nbarrier--and stand there with the flashing bayonet of his pride.\r\nOther men who broke the laws of justice and charity lied to all\r\nthe world. He at any rate would not lie to himself. He was more\r\nthan Byronic now: not the spiritual rebel, Don Juan; not the\r\nphilosophical rebel, Faust; but a new psychological rebel of his\r\nown century--defying the sentimental a priori forms of his own\r\nmind---\r\n\r\nHappiness was what he wanted--a slowly rising scale of\r\ngratifications of the normal appetites--and he had a strong\r\nconviction that the materials, if not the inspiration of\r\nhappiness, could be bought with money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night came that drew him out upon his second venture, and\r\nas he walked the dark street he felt in himself a great\r\nresemblance to a cat--a certain supple, swinging litheness. His\r\nmuscles were rippling smoothly and sleekly under his spare,\r\nhealthy flesh--he had an absurd desire to bound along the\r\nstreet, to run dodging among trees, to turn "cart-wheels" over\r\nsoft grass.\r\n\r\nIt was not crisp, but in the air lay a faint suggestion of\r\nacerbity, inspirational rather than chilling.\r\n\r\n"The moon is down--I have not heard the clock!"\r\n\r\nHe laughed in delight at the line which an early memory had\r\nendowed with a hushed awesome beauty.\r\n\r\nHe passed a man and then another a quarter of mile afterward.\r\n\r\nHe was on Philmore Street now and it was very dark. He blessed\r\nthe city council for not having put in new lamp-posts as a\r\nrecent budget had recommended. Here was the red-brick Sterner\r\nresidence which marked the beginning of the avenue; here was the\r\nJordon house, the Eisenhaurs\', the Dents\', the Markhams\', the\r\nFrasers\'; the Hawkins\', where he had been a guest; the\r\nWilloughbys\', the Everett\'s, colonial and ornate; the little\r\ncottage where lived the Watts old maids between the imposing\r\nfronts of the Macys\' and the Krupstadts\'; the Craigs--\r\n\r\nAh . . . THERE! He paused, wavered violently--far up the street\r\nwas a blot, a man walking, possibly a policeman. After an\r\neternal second be found himself following the vague, ragged\r\nshadow of a lamp-post across a lawn, running bent very low.\r\nThen he was standing tense, without breath or need of it, in the\r\nshadow of his limestone prey.\r\n\r\nInterminably he listened--a mile off a cat howled, a hundred\r\nyards away another took up the hymn in a demoniacal snarl, and\r\nhe felt his heart dip and swoop, acting as shock-absorber for\r\nhis mind. There were other sounds; the faintest fragment of song\r\nfar away; strident, gossiping laughter from a back porch\r\ndiagonally across the alley; and crickets, crickets singing in\r\nthe patched, patterned, moonlit grass of the yard. Within the\r\nhouse there seemed to lie an ominous silence. He was glad he did\r\nnot know who lived here.\r\n\r\nHis slight shiver hardened to steel; the steel softened and his\r\nnerves became pliable as leather; gripping his hands he\r\ngratefully found them supple, and taking out knife and pliers he\r\nwent to work on the screen.\r\n\r\nSo sure was he that he was unobserved that, from the dining-room\r\nwhere in a minute he found himself, he leaned out and carefully\r\npulled the screen up into position, balancing it so it would\r\nneither fall by chance nor be a serious obstacle to a sudden\r\nexit.\r\n\r\nThen he put the open knife in his coat pocket, took out his\r\npocket-flash, and tiptoed around the room.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing here he could use--the dining-room had never\r\nbeen included in his plans for the town was too small to permit\r\ndisposing of silver.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact his plans were of the vaguest. He had found\r\nthat with a mind like his, lucrative in intelligence, intuition,\r\nand lightning decision, it was best to have but the skeleton of\r\na campaign. The machine-gun episode had taught him that. And he\r\nwas afraid that a method preconceived would give him two points\r\nof view in a crisis--and two points of view meant wavering.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled slightly on a chair, held his breath, listened, went\r\non, found the hall, found the stairs, started up; the seventh\r\nstair creaked at his step, the ninth, the fourteenth. He was\r\ncounting them automatically. At the third creak he paused again\r\nfor over a minute--and in that minute he felt more alone than he\r\nhad ever felt before. Between the lines on patrol, even when\r\nalone, he had had behind him the moral support of half a billion\r\npeople; now he was alone, pitted against that same moral\r\npressure--a bandit. He had never felt this fear, yet he had\r\nnever felt this exultation.\r\n\r\nThe stairs came to an end, a doorway approached; he went in and\r\nlistened to regular breathing. His feet were economical of steps\r\nand his body swayed sometimes at stretching as he felt over the\r\nbureau, pocketing all articles which held promise--he could not\r\nhave enumerated them ten seconds afterward. He felt on a chair\r\nfor possible trousers, found soft garments, women\'s lingerie.\r\nThe corners of his mouth smiled mechanically.\r\n\r\nAnother room . . . the same breathing, enlivened by one ghastly\r\nsnort that sent his heart again on its tour of his breast. Round\r\nobject--watch; chain; roll of bills; stick-pins; two rings--he\r\nremembered that he had got rings from the other bureau. He\r\nstarted out winced as a faint glow flashed in front of him,\r\nfacing him. God!--it was the glow of his own wrist-watch on his\r\noutstretched arm.\r\n\r\nDown the stairs. He skipped two crumbing steps but found\r\nanother. He was all right now, practically safe; as he neared\r\nthe bottom he felt a slight boredom. He reached the dining-room\r\n--considered the silver--again decided against it.\r\n\r\nBack in his room at the boarding-house he examined the additions\r\nto his personal property:\r\n\r\nSixty-five dollars in bills.\r\n\r\nA platinum ring with three medium diamonds, worth, probably,\r\nabout seven hundred dollars. Diamonds were going up.\r\n\r\nA cheap gold-plated ring with the initials O. S. and the date\r\ninside--\'03--probably a class-ring from school. Worth a few\r\ndollars. Unsalable.\r\n\r\nA red-cloth case containing a set of false teeth.\r\n\r\nA silver watch.\r\n\r\nA gold chain worth more than the watch.\r\n\r\nAn empty ring-box.\r\n\r\nA little ivory Chinese god--probably a desk ornament.\r\n\r\nA dollar and sixty-two cents in small change.\r\n\r\nHe put the money under his pillow and the other things in the\r\ntoe of an infantry boot, stuffing a stocking in on top of them.\r\nThen for two hours his mind raced like a high-power engine here\r\nand there through his life, past and future, through fear and\r\nlaughter. With a vague, inopportune wish that he were married,\r\nhe fell into a deep sleep about half past five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the newspaper account of the burglary failed to mention\r\nthe false teeth, they worried him considerably.  The picture of\r\na human waking in the cool dawn and groping for them in vain,\r\nof a soft, toothless breakfast, of a strange, hollow, lisping\r\nvoice calling the police station, of weary, dispirited visits\r\nto the dentist, roused a great fatherly pity in him.\r\n\r\nTrying to ascertain whether they belonged to a man or a woman,\r\nhe took them carefully out of the case and held them up near\r\nhis mouth. He moved his own jaws experimentally; he measured\r\nwith his fingers; but he failed to decide: they might belong\r\neither to a large-mouthed woman or a small-mouthed man.\r\n\r\nOn a warm impulse he wrapped them in brown paper from the\r\nbottom of his army trunk, and printed FALSE TEETH on the\r\npackage in clumsy pencil letters. Then, the next night, he\r\nwalked down Philmore Street, and shied the package onto the\r\nlawn so that it would be near the door. Next day the paper\r\nannounced that the police had a clew--they knew that the\r\nburglar was in town. However, they didn\'t mention what the\r\nclew was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month "Burglar Bill of the Silver District\r\nwas the nurse-girl\'s standby for frightening children. Five\r\nburglaries were attributed to him, but though Dalyrimple had\r\nonly committed three, he considered that majority had it and\r\nappropriated the title to himself. He had once been seen--"a\r\nlarge bloated creature with the meanest face you ever laid eyes\r\non." Mrs. Henry Coleman, awaking at two o\'clock at the beam of\r\nan electric torch flashed in her eye, could not have been\r\nexpected to recognize Bryan Dalyrimple at whom she had waved\r\nflags last Fourth of July, and whom she had described as "not\r\nat all the daredevil type, do you think?"\r\n\r\nWhen Dalyrimple kept his imagination at white heat he managed to\r\nglorify his own attitude, his emancipation from petty scruples\r\nand remorses--but let him once allow his thought to rove\r\nunarmored, great unexpected horrors and depressions would\r\novertake him. Then for reassurance he had to go back to think\r\nout the whole thing over again. He found that it was on the\r\nwhole better to give up considering himself as a rebel. It was\r\nmore consoling to think of every one else as a fool.\r\n\r\nHis attitude toward Mr. Macy underwent a change. He no longer\r\nfelt a dim animosity and inferiority in his presence. As his\r\nfourth month in the store ended he found himself regarding his\r\nemployer in a manner that was almost fraternal.  He had a vague\r\nbut very assured conviction that Mr. Macy\'s innermost soul would\r\nhave abetted and approved. He no longer worried about his\r\nfuture. He had the intention of accumulating several thousand\r\ndollars and then clearing out--going east, back to France, down\r\nto South America. Half a dozen times in the last two months he\r\nhad been about to stop work, but a fear of attracting attention\r\nto his being in funds prevented him. So he worked on, no longer\r\nin listlessness, but with contemptuous amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThen with astounding suddenness something happened that changed\r\nhis plans and put an end to his burglaries.\r\n\r\nMr. Macy sent for him one afternoon and with a great show of\r\njovial mystery asked him if he had an engagement that night. If\r\nhe hadn\'t, would he please call on Mr. Alfred J. Fraser at eight\r\no\'clock. Dalyrimple\'s wonder was mingled with uncertainty. He\r\ndebated with himself whether it were not his cue to take the\r\nfirst train out of town. But an hour\'s consideration decided him\r\nthat his fears were unfounded and at eight o\'clock he arrived at\r\nthe big Fraser house in Philmore Avenue.\r\n\r\nMr. Fraser was commonly supposed to be the biggest political\r\ninfluence in the city. His brother was Senator Fraser, his\r\nson-in-law was Congressman Demming, and his influence, though not\r\nwielded in such a way as to make him an objectionable boss, was\r\nstrong nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHe had a great, huge face, deep-set eyes, and a barn-door of an\r\nupper lip, the melange approaching a worthy climax in a long\r\nprofessional jaw.\r\n\r\nDuring his conversation with Dalyrimple his expression kept\r\nstarting toward a smile, reached a cheerful optimism, and then\r\nreceded back to imperturbability.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, sir?" he laid, holding out his hand. "Sit down.\r\nI suppose you\'re wondering why I wanted you. Sit down."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple sat down.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dalyrimple, how old are you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m twenty-three."\r\n\r\n"You\'re young. But that doesn\'t mean you\'re foolish. Mr.\r\nDalyrimple, what I\'ve got to say won\'t take long. I\'m going to\r\nmake you a proposition. To begin at the beginning, I\'ve been\r\nwatching you ever since last Fourth of July when you made that\r\nspeech in response to the loving-cup."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple murmured disparagingly, but Fraser waved him to\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"It was a speech I\'ve remembered. It was a brainy speech,\r\nstraight from the shoulder, and it got to everybody in that\r\ncrowd. I know. I\'ve watched crowds for years." He cleared his\r\nthroat as if tempted to digress on his knowledge of crowds--then\r\ncontinued. "But, Mr. Dalyrimple, I\'ve seen too many young men\r\nwho promised brilliantly go to pieces, fail through want of\r\nsteadiness, too many high-power ideas, and not enough\r\nwillingness to work. So I waited. I wanted to see what you\'d\r\ndo. I wanted to see if you\'d go to work, and if you\'d stick to\r\nwhat you started."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple felt a glow settle over him.\r\n\r\n"So," continued Fraser, "when Theron Macy told me you\'d started\r\ndown at his place, I kept watching you, and I followed your\r\nrecord through him.  The first month I was afraid for awhile.\r\nHe told me you were getting restless, too good for your job,\r\nhinting around for a raise---"\r\n\r\nDalyrimple started.\r\n\r\n"---But he said after that you evidently made up your mind to\r\nshut up and stick to it. That\'s the stuff I like in a young man!\r\nThat\'s the stuff that wins out. And don\'t think I don\'t\r\nunderstand. I know how much harder it was for you after all that\r\nsilly flattery a lot of old women had been giving you. I know\r\nwhat a fight it must have been---"\r\n\r\nDalyrimple\'s face was burning brightly. It felt young and\r\nstrangely ingenuous.\r\n\r\n"Dalyrimple, you\'ve got brains and you\'ve got the stuff in you--\r\nand that\'s what I want. I\'m going to put you into the State\r\nSenate."\r\n\r\n"The WHAT?"\r\n\r\n"The State Senate. We want a young man who has got brains, but\r\nis solid and not a loafer. And when I say State Senate I don\'t\r\nstop there. We\'re up against it here, Dalyrimple. We\'ve got to\r\nget some young men into politics--you know the old blood that\'s\r\nbeen running on the party ticket year in and year out."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple licked his lips.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll run me for the State Senate?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll PUT you in the State Senate."\r\n\r\nMr. Fraser\'s expression had now reached the\r\npoint nearest a smile and Dalyrimple in a happy frivolity felt\r\nhimself urging it mentally on--but it stopped, locked, and slid\r\nfrom him. The barn-door and the jaw were separated by a line\r\nstrait as a nail.  Dalyrimple remembered with an effort that it\r\nwas a mouth, and talked to it.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m through," he said.  "My notoriety\'s dead.  People are\r\nfed up with me."\r\n\r\n"Those things," answered Mr. Fraser, "are mechanical.  Linotype\r\nis a resuscitator of reputations.  Wait till you see the HERALD,\r\nbeginning next week--that is if you\'re with us--that is," and\r\nhis voice hardened slightly, "if you haven\'t got too many ideas\r\nyourself about how things ought to be run."\r\n\r\n"No," said Dalyrimple, looking him frankly in the eye.  "You\'ll\r\nhave to give me a lot of advice at first."\r\n\r\n"Very well.  I\'ll take care of your reputation then.  Just keep\r\nyourself on the right side of the fence."\r\n\r\nDalyrimple started at this repetition of a phrase he had thought\r\nof so much lately.  There was a sudden ring at the door-bell.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Macy now," observed Fraser, rising.  "I\'ll go let him in.\r\nThe servants have gone to bed."\r\n\r\nHe left Dalyrimple there in a dream.  The world was opening up\r\nsuddenly-- The State Senate, the United States Senate--so life\r\nwas this after all--cutting corners--common sense, that was the\r\nrule.  No more foolish risks now unless necessity called--but it\r\nwas being hard that counted-- Never to let remorse or\r\nself-reproach lose him a night\'s sleep--let his life be a sword of\r\ncourage--there was no payment--all that was drivel--drivel.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet with clinched hands in a sort of triumph.\r\n\r\n"Well, Bryan," said Mr. Macy stepping through the porti\xe8res.\r\n\r\nThe two older men smiled their half-smiles at him.\r\n\r\n"Well Bryan," said Mr. Macy again.\r\n\r\nDalyrimple smiled also.\r\n\r\n"How do, Mr. Macy?"\r\n\r\nHe wondered if some telepathy between them had made this new\r\nappreciation possible--some invisible realization. . . .\r\n\r\nMr. Macy held out his hand.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad we\'re to be associated in this scheme--I\'ve been for\r\nyou all along--especially lately. I\'m glad we\'re to be on the\r\nsame side of the fence."\r\n\r\n"I want to thank you, sir," said Dalyrimple simply. He felt a\r\nwhimsical moisture gathering back of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Four Fists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time no one I know has the slightest desire to\r\nhit Samuel Meredith; possibly this is because a man over fifty\r\nis liable to be rather severely cracked at the impact of a\r\nhostile fist, but, for my part, I am inclined to think that all\r\nhis hitable qualities have quite vanished. But it is certain\r\nthat at various times in his life hitable qualities were in his\r\nface, as surely as kissable qualities have ever lurked in a\r\ngirl\'s lips.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure every one has met a man like that, been casually\r\nintroduced, even made a friend of him, yet felt he was the sort\r\nwho aroused passionate dislike--expressed by some in the\r\ninvoluntary clinching of fists, and in others by mutterings\r\nabout "takin\' a poke" and "landin\' a swift smash in ee eye." In\r\nthe juxtaposition of Samuel Meredith\'s features this quality was\r\nso strong that it influenced his entire life.\r\n\r\nWhat was it? Not the shape, certainly, for he was a pleasant-looking\r\nman from earliest youth: broad-bowed with gray eyes that\r\nwere frank and friendly. Yet I\'ve heard him tell a room full of\r\nreporters angling for a "success" story that he\'d be ashamed to\r\ntell them the truth that they wouldn\'t believe it, that it\r\nwasn\'t one story but four, that the public would not want to\r\nread about a man who had been walloped into prominence.\r\n\r\nIt all started at Phillips Andover Academy when he was fourteen.\r\nHe had been brought up on a diet of caviar and bell-boys\' legs\r\nin half the capitals of Europe, and it was pure luck that his\r\nmother had nervous prostration and had to delegate his education\r\nto less tender, less biassed hands.\r\n\r\nAt Andover he was given a roommate named Gilly Hood. Gilly was\r\nthirteen, undersized, and rather the school pet. From the\r\nSeptember day when Mr. Meredith\'s valet stowed Samuel\'s clothing\r\nin the best bureau and asked, on departing, "hif there was\r\nhanything helse, Master Samuel?" Gilly cried out that the\r\nfaculty had played him false. He felt like an irate frog in\r\nwhose bowl has been put goldfish.\r\n\r\n"Good gosh!" he complained to his sympathetic contemporaries,\r\n"he\'s a damn stuck-up Willie. He said, \'Are the crowd here\r\ngentlemen?\' and I said, \'No, they\'re boys,\' and he said age\r\ndidn\'t matter, and I said, \'Who said it did?\' Let him get fresh\r\nwith me, the ole pieface!"\r\n\r\nFor three weeks Gilly endured in silence young Samuel\'s comments\r\non the clothes and habits of Gilly\'s personal friends, endured\r\nFrench phrases in conversation, endured a hundred half-feminine\r\nmeannesses that show what a nervous mother can do to a boy, if\r\nshe keeps close enough to him--then a storm broke in the aquarium.\r\n\r\nSamuel was out. A crowd had gathered to hear Gilly be wrathful\r\nabout his roommate\'s latest sins.\r\n\r\n"He said, \'Oh, I don\'t like the windows open at night,\' he said,\r\n\'except only a little bit,\'" complained Gilly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let him boss you."\r\n\r\n"Boss me?  You bet he won\'t.  I open those windows, I guess, but\r\nthe darn fool won\'t take turns shuttin\' \'em in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Make him, Gilly, why don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to."  Gilly nodded his head in fierce agreement.\r\n"Don\'t you worry.  He needn\'t think I\'m any ole butler."\r\n\r\n"Le\'s see you make him."\r\n\r\nAt this point the darn fool entered in person and included the\r\ncrowd in one of his irritating smiles.  Two boys said, "\'Lo,\r\nMer\'dith"; the others gave him a chilly glance and went on talking\r\nto Gilly.  But Samuel seemed unsatisfied.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind not sitting on my bed?" he suggested politely to\r\ntwo of Gilly\'s particulars who were perched very much at ease.\r\n\r\n"Huh?"\r\n\r\n"My bed.  Can\'t you understand English?"\r\n\r\nThis was adding insult to injury.  There were several comments on\r\nthe bed\'s sanitary condition and the evidence within it of animal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"S\'matter with your old bed?" demanded Gilly truculently.\r\n\r\n"The bed\'s all right, but---"\r\n\r\nGilly interrupted this sentence by rising and walking up to\r\nSamuel. He paused several inches away and eyed him fiercely.\r\n\r\n"You an\' your crazy ole bed," he began. "You an\' your crazy---"\r\n\r\n"Go to it, Gilly," murmured some one.\r\n\r\n"Show the darn fool--"\r\n\r\nSamuel returned the gaze coolly.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said finally, "it\'s my bed--"\r\n\r\nHe got no further, for Gilly hauled off and hit him succinctly in\r\nthe nose.\r\n\r\n"Yea! Gilly!"\r\n\r\n"Show the big bully!"\r\n\r\n"Just let him touch you--he\'ll see!"\r\n\r\nThe group closed in on them and for the first time in his life\r\nSamuel realized the insuperable inconvenience of being\r\npassionately detested. He gazed around helplessly at the\r\nglowering, violently hostile faces. He towered a head taller\r\nthan his roommate, so if he hit back he\'d be called a bully and\r\nhave half a dozen more fights on his hands within five minutes;\r\nyet if he didn\'t he was a coward. For a moment he stood there\r\nfacing Gilly\'s blazing eyes, and then, with a sudden choking\r\nsound, he forced his way through the ring and rushed from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe month following bracketed the thirty most miserable days of\r\nhis life. Every waking moment he was under the lashing tongues\r\nof his contemporaries; his habits and mannerisms became butts\r\nfor intolerable witticisms and, of course, the sensitiveness of\r\nadolescence was a further thorn. He considered that he was a\r\nnatural pariah; that the unpopularity at school would follow him\r\nthrough life. When he went home for the Christmas holidays he\r\nwas so despondent that his father sent him to a nerve\r\nspecialist. When he returned to Andover he arranged to arrive\r\nlate so that he could be alone in the bus during the drive from\r\nstation to school.\r\n\r\nOf course when he had learned to keep his mouth shut every one\r\npromptly forgot all about him. The next autumn, with his\r\nrealization that consideration for others was the discreet\r\nattitude, he made good use of the clean start given him by the\r\nshortness of boyhood memory. By the beginning of his senior year\r\nSamuel Meredith was one of the best-liked boys of his class--and\r\nno one was any stronger for him than his first friend and\r\nconstant companion, Gilly Hood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel became the sort of college student who in the early\r\nnineties drove tandems and coaches and tallyhos between\r\nPrinceton and Yale and New York City to show that they\r\nappreciated the social importance of football games. He believed\r\npassionately in good form--his choosing of gloves, his tying of\r\nties, his holding of reins were imitated by impressionable\r\nfreshmen. Outside of his own set he was considered rather a\r\nsnob, but as his set was THE set, it never worried him. He\r\nplayed football in the autumn, drank high-balls in the winter,\r\nand rowed in the spring. Samuel despised all those who were\r\nmerely sportsmen without being gentlemen or merely gentlemen\r\nwithout being sportsmen.\r\n\r\nHe lived in New York and often brought home several of his\r\nfriends for the week-end. Those were the days of the horse-car\r\nand in case of a crush it was, of course, the proper thing for\r\nany one of Samuel\'s set to rise and deliver his seat to a\r\nstanding lady with a formal bow. One night in Samuel\'s junior\r\nyear he boarded a car with two of his intimates. There were\r\nthree vacant seats. When Samuel sat down he noticed a heavy-eyed\r\nlaboring man sitting next to him who smelt objectionably of\r\ngarlic, sagged slightly against Samuel and, spreading a little\r\nas a tired man will, took up quite too much room.\r\n\r\nThe car had gone several blocks when it stopped for a quartet of\r\nyoung girls, and, of course, the three men of the world sprang\r\nto their feet and proffered their seats with due observance of\r\nform. Unfortunately, the laborer, being unacquainted with the\r\ncode of neckties and tallyhos, failed to follow their example,\r\nand one young lady was left at an embarrassed stance. Fourteen\r\neyes glared reproachfully at the barbarian; seven lips curled\r\nslightly; but the object of scorn stared stolidly into the\r\nforeground in sturdy unconsciousness of his despicable conduct.\r\nSamuel was the most violently affected. He was humiliated that\r\nany male should so conduct himself. He spoke aloud.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a lady standing," he said sternly.\r\n\r\nThat should have been quite enough, but the object of scorn only\r\nlooked up blankly. The standing girl tittered and exchanged\r\nnervous glances with her companions. But Samuel was aroused.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a lady standing," he repeated, rather raspingly. The\r\nman seemed to comprehend.\r\n\r\n"I pay my fare," he said quietly.\r\n\r\nSamuel turned red and his hands clinched, but the conductor was\r\nlooking their way, so at a warning nod from his friends he\r\nsubsided into sullen gloom.\r\n\r\nThey reached their destination and left the car, but so did the\r\nlaborer, who followed them, swinging his little pail. Seeing his\r\nchance, Samuel no longer resisted his aristocratic inclination.\r\nHe turned around and, launching a full-featured, dime-novel\r\nsneer, made a loud remark about the right of the lower animals\r\nto ride with human beings.\r\n\r\nIn a half-second the workman had dropped his pail and let fly at\r\nhim. Unprepared, Samuel took the blow neatly on the jaw and\r\nsprawled full length into the cobblestone gutter.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh at me!" cried his assailant. "I been workin\' all\r\nday. I\'m tired as hell!"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the sudden anger died out of his eyes and the mask\r\nof weariness dropped again over his face. He turned and picked\r\nup his pail. Samuel\'s friends took a quick step in his direction.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" Samuel had risen slowly and was motioning back. Some\r\ntime, somewhere, he had been struck like that before. Then he\r\nremembered--Gilly Hood. In the silence, as he dusted himself\r\noff, the whole scene in the room at Andover was before his eyes--\r\nand he knew intuitively that he had been wrong again.  This\r\nman\'s strength, his rest, was the protection of his family. He\r\nhad more use for his seat in the street-car than any young girl.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right," said Samuel gruffly. "Don\'t touch \'him. I\'ve\r\nbeen a damn fool."\r\n\r\nOf course it took more than an hour, or a week, for Samuel to\r\nrearrange his ideas on the essential importance of good form. At\r\nfirst he simply admitted that his wrongness had made him\r\npowerless--as it had made him powerless against Gilly--but\r\neventually his mistake about the workman influenced his entire\r\nattitude. Snobbishness is, after all, merely good breeding grown\r\ndictatorial; so Samuel\'s code remained but the necessity of\r\nimposing it upon others had faded out in a certain gutter.\r\nWithin that year his class had somehow stopped referring to him\r\nas a snob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a few years Samuel\'s university decided that it had shone\r\nlong enough in the reflected glory of his neckties, so they\r\ndeclaimed to him in Latin, charged him ten dollars for the paper\r\nwhich proved him irretrievably educated, and sent him into the\r\nturmoil with much self-confidence, a few friends, and the proper\r\nassortment of harmless bad habits.\r\n\r\nHis family had by that time started back to shirt-sleeves,\r\nthrough a sudden decline in the sugar-market, and it had already\r\nunbuttoned its vest, so to speak, when Samuel went to work. His\r\nmind was that exquisite TABULA RASA that a university education\r\nsometimes leaves, but he had both energy and influence, so he\r\nused his former ability as a dodging half-back in twisting\r\nthrough Wall Street crowds as runner for a bank.\r\n\r\nHis diversion was--women. There were half a dozen: two or three\r\nd\xe9butantes, an actress (in a minor way), a grass-widow, and one\r\nsentimental little brunette who was married and lived in a\r\nlittle house in Jersey City.\r\n\r\nThey had met on a ferry-boat. Samuel was crossing from New York\r\non business (he had been working several years by this time) and\r\nhe helped her look for a package that she had dropped in the crush.\r\n\r\n"Do you come over often?" he inquired casually.\r\n\r\n"Just to shop," she said shyly. She had great brown eyes and the\r\npathetic kind of little mouth. "I\'ve only been married three\r\nmonths, and we find it cheaper to live over here."\r\n\r\n"Does he--does your husband like your being alone like this?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, a cheery young laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear me, no. We were to meet for dinner but I must have\r\nmisunderstood the place. He\'ll be awfully worried."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Samuel disapprovingly, "he ought to be. If you\'ll\r\nallow me I\'ll see you home."\r\n\r\nShe accepted his offer thankfully, so they took the cable-car\r\ntogether. When they walked up the path to her little house they\r\nsaw a light there; her husband had arrived before her.\r\n\r\n"He\'s frightfully jealous," she announced, laughingly apologetic.\r\n\r\n"Very well," answered Samuel, rather stiffly. "I\'d better leave\r\nyou here."\r\n\r\nShe thanked him and, waving a good night, he left her.\r\n\r\nThat would have been quite all if they hadn\'t met on Fifth\r\nAvenue one morning a week later. She started and blushed and\r\nseemed so glad to see him that they chatted like old friends.\r\nShe was going to her dressmaker\'s, eat lunch alone at Taine\'s,\r\nshop all afternoon, and meet her husband on the ferry at five.\r\nSamuel told her that her husband was a very lucky man. She\r\nblushed again and scurried off.\r\n\r\nSamuel whistled all the way back to his office, but about twelve\r\no\'clock he began to see that pathetic, appealing little mouth\r\neverywhere--and those brown eyes. He fidgeted when he looked at\r\nthe clock; he thought of the grill down-stairs where he lunched\r\nand the heavy male conversation thereof, and opposed to that\r\npicture appeared another; a little table at Taine\'s with the\r\nbrown eyes and the mouth a few feet away. A few minutes before\r\ntwelve-thirty he dashed on his hat and rushed for the cable-car.\r\n\r\nShe was quite surprised to see him.\r\n\r\n"Why--hello," she said. Samuel could tell that she was just\r\npleasantly frightened.\r\n\r\n"I thought we might lunch together. It\'s so dull eating with a\r\nlot of men."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Why, I suppose there\'s no harm in it. How could there be!"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to her that her husband should have taken lunch with\r\nher--but he was generally so hurried at noon. She told Samuel\r\nall about him: he was a little smaller than Samuel, but, oh,\r\nMUCH better-looking. He was a book-keeper and not making a lot\r\nof money, but they were very happy and expected to be rich\r\nwithin three or four years.\r\n\r\nSamuel\'s grass-widow had been in a quarrelsome mood for three or\r\nfour weeks, and through contrast, he took an accentuated\r\npleasure in this meeting; so fresh was she, and earnest, and\r\nfaintly adventurous. Her name was Marjorie.\r\n\r\nThey made another engagement; in fact, for a month they lunched\r\ntogether two or three times a week. When she was sure that her\r\nhusband would work late Samuel took her over to New Jersey on\r\nthe ferry, leaving her always on the tiny front porch, after\r\nshe had gone in and lit the gas to use the security of his\r\nmasculine presence outside. This grew to be a ceremony--and it\r\nannoyed him. Whenever the comfortable glow fell out through the\r\nfront windows, that was his CONG\xc9; yet he never suggested coming\r\nin and Marjorie didn\'t invite him.\r\n\r\nThen, when Samuel and Marjorie had reached a stage in which they\r\nsometimes touched each other\'s arms gently, just to show that\r\nthey were very good friends, Marjorie and her husband had one of\r\nthose ultrasensitive, supercritical quarrels that couples never\r\nindulge in unless they care a great deal about each other. It\r\nstarted with a cold mutton-chop or a leak in the gas-jet--and\r\none day Samuel found her in Taine\'s, with dark shadows under her\r\nbrown eyes and a terrifying pout.\r\n\r\nBy this time Samuel thought he was in love with Marjorie--so he\r\nplayed up the quarrel for all it was worth. He was her best\r\nfriend and patted her hand--and leaned down close to her brown\r\ncurls while she whispered in little sobs what her husband had\r\nsaid that morning; and he was a little more than her best friend\r\nwhen he took her over to the ferry in a hansom.\r\n\r\n"Marjorie," he said gently, when he left her, as usual, on the\r\nporch, "if at any time you want to call on me, remember that I\r\nam always waiting, always waiting."\r\n\r\nShe nodded gravely and put both her hands in his. "I know," she\r\nsaid. "I know you\'re my friend, my best friend."\r\n\r\nThen she ran into the house and he watched there until the gas\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nFor the next week Samuel was in a nervous turmoil. Some\r\npersistently rational strain warned him that at bottom he and\r\nMarjorie had little in common, but in such cases there is\r\nusually so much mud in the water that one can seldom see to the\r\nbottom. Every dream and desire told him that he loved Marjorie,\r\nwanted her, had to have her.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel developed. Marjorie\'s husband took to staying in New\r\nYork until late at night, came home several times disagreeably\r\noverstimulated, and made her generally miserable. They must have\r\nhad too much pride to talk it out--for Marjorie\'s husband was,\r\nafter all, pretty decent--so it drifted on from one\r\nmisunderstanding to another. Marjorie kept coming more and more\r\nto Samuel; when a woman can accept masculine sympathy at is much\r\nmore satisfactory to her than crying to another girl. But\r\nMarjorie didn\'t realize how much she had begun to rely on him,\r\nhow much he was part of her little cosmos.\r\n\r\nOne night, instead of turning away when Marjorie went in and lit\r\nthe gas, Samuel went in, too, and they sat together on the sofa\r\nin the little parlor. He was very happy. He envied their home,\r\nand he felt that the man who neglected such a possession out of\r\nstubborn pride was a fool and unworthy of his wife. But when he\r\nkissed Marjorie for the first time she cried softly and told him\r\nto go. He sailed home on the wings of desperate excitement,\r\nquite resolved to fan this spark of romance, no matter how big\r\nthe blaze or who was burned. At the time he considered that his\r\nthoughts were unselfishly of her; in a later perspective he knew\r\nthat she had meant no more than the white screen in a motion\r\npicture: it was just Samuel--blind, desirous.\r\n\r\nNext day at Taine\'s, when they met for lunch, Samuel dropped all\r\npretense and made frank love to her. He had no plans, no\r\ndefinite intentions, except to kiss her lips again, to hold her\r\nin his arms and feel that she was very little and pathetic and\r\nlovable. . . . He took her home, and this time they kissed until\r\nboth their hearts beat high--words and phrases formed on his lips.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly there were steps on the porch--a hand tried\r\nthe outside door. Marjorie turned dead-white.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" she whispered to Samuel, in a frightened voice, but in\r\nangry impatience at the interruption he walked to the front door\r\nand threw it open.\r\n\r\nEvery one has seen such scenes on the stage--seen them so often\r\nthat when they actually happen people behave very much like\r\nactors. Samuel felt that he was playing a part and the lines\r\ncame quite naturally: he announced that all had a right to lead\r\ntheir own lives and looked at Marjorie\'s husband menacingly, as\r\nif daring him to doubt it. Marjorie\'s husband spoke of the\r\nsanctity of the home, forgetting that it hadn\'t seemed very holy\r\nto him lately; Samuel continued along the line of "the right to\r\nhappiness"; Marjorie\'s husband mentioned firearms and the\r\ndivorce court. Then suddenly he stopped and scrutinized both of\r\nthem--Marjorie in pitiful collapse on the sofa, Samuel\r\nharanguing the furniture in a consciously heroic pose.\r\n\r\n"Go up-stairs, Marjorie," he said, in a different tone.\r\n\r\n"Stay where you are!" Samuel countered quickly.\r\n\r\nMarjorie rose, wavered, and sat down, rose again and moved\r\nhesitatingly toward the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Come outside," said her husband to Samuel. "I want to talk to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nSamuel glanced at Marjorie, tried to get some message from her\r\neyes; then he shut his lips and went out.\r\n\r\nThere was a bright moon and when Marjorie\'s husband came down\r\nthe steps Samuel could see plainly that he was suffering--but\r\nhe felt no pity for him.\r\n\r\nThey stood and looked at each other, a few feet apart, and the\r\nhusband cleared his throat as though it were a bit husky.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my wife," he said quietly, and then a wild anger surged\r\nup inside him.  "Damn you!" he cried--and hit Samuel in the\r\nface with all his strength.\r\n\r\nIn that second, as Samuel slumped to the ground, it flashed to\r\nhim that he had been hit like that twice before, and\r\nsimultaneously the incident altered like a dream--he felt\r\nsuddenly awake.  Mechanically he sprang to his feet and squared\r\noff.  The other man was waiting, fists up, a yard away, but\r\nSamuel knew that though physically he had him by several inches\r\nand many pounds, he wouldn\'t hit him. The situation had\r\nmiraculously and entirely changed--a moment before Samuel had\r\nseemed to himself heroic; now he seemed the cad, the outsider,\r\nand Marjorie\'s husband, silhouetted against the lights of the\r\nlittle house, the eternal heroic figure, the defender of his home.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and then Samuel turned quickly away and went\r\ndown the path for the last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, after the third blow Samuel put in several weeks at\r\nconscientious introspection. The blow years before at Andover\r\nhad landed on his personal unpleasantness; the workman of his\r\ncollege days had jarred the snobbishness out of his system, and\r\nMarjorie\'s husband had given a severe jolt to his greedy\r\nselfishness. It threw women out of his ken until a year later,\r\nwhen he met his future wife; for the only sort of woman worth\r\nwhile seemed to be the one who could be protected as Marjorie\'s\r\nhusband had protected her. Samuel could not imagine his grass-widow,\r\nMrs. De Ferriac, causing any very righteous blows on her\r\nown account.\r\n\r\nHis early thirties found him well on his feet. He was associated\r\nwith old Peter Carhart, who was in those days a national figure.\r\nCarhart\'s physique was like a rough model for a statue of\r\nHercules, and his record was just as solid--a pile made for the\r\npure joy of it, without cheap extortion or shady scandal. He had\r\nbeen a great friend of Samuel\'s father, but he watched the son\r\nfor six years before taking him into his own office. Heaven\r\nknows how many things he controlled at that time--mines,\r\nrailroads, banks, whole cities. Samuel was very close to him,\r\nknew his likes and dislikes, his prejudices, weaknesses and\r\nmany strengths.\r\n\r\nOne day Carhart sent for Samuel and, closing the door of his\r\ninner office, offered him a chair and a cigar.\r\n\r\n"Everything O. K., Samuel?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been afraid you\'re getting a bit stale."\r\n\r\n"Stale?" Samuel was puzzled.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve done no work outside the office for nearly ten years?"\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve had vacations, in the Adiron---"\r\n\r\nCarhart waved this aside.\r\n\r\n"I mean outside work. Seeing the things move that we\'ve always\r\npulled the strings of here."\r\n\r\n"No," admitted Samuel; "I haven\'t."\r\n\r\n"So," he said abruptly "I\'m going to give you an outside job\r\nthat\'ll take about a month."\r\n\r\nSamuel didn\'t argue. He rather liked the idea and he made up his\r\nmind that, whatever it was, he would put it through just as\r\nCarhart wanted it. That was his employer\'s greatest hobby, and\r\nthe men around him were as dumb under direct orders as infantry\r\nsubalterns.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll go to San Antonio and see Hamil," continued Carhart.\r\n"He\'s got a job on hand and he wants a man to take charge."\r\n\r\nHamil was in charge of the Carhart interests in the Southwest, a\r\nman who had grown up in the shadow of his employer, and with\r\nwhom, though they had never met, Samuel had had much official\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n"When do I leave?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better go to-morrow," answered Carhart, glancing at the\r\ncalendar. "That\'s the 1st of May. I\'ll expect your report here on\r\nthe 1st of June."\r\n\r\nNext morning Samuel left for Chicago, and two days later he was\r\nfacing Hamil across a table in the office of the Merchants\'\r\nTrust in San Antonio. It didn\'t take long to get the gist of the\r\nthing. It was a big deal in oil which concerned the buying up of\r\nseventeen huge adjoining ranches. This buying up had to be done\r\nin one week, and it was a pure squeeze. Forces had been set in\r\nmotion that put the seventeen owners between the devil and the\r\ndeep sea, and Samuel\'s part was simply to "handle" the matter\r\nfrom a little village near Pueblo. With tact and efficiency the\r\nright man could bring it off without any friction, for it was\r\nmerely a question of sitting at the wheel and keeping a firm\r\nhold. Hamil, with an astuteness many times valuable to his\r\nchief, had arranged a situation that would give a much greater\r\nclear gain than any dealing in the open market. Samuel shook\r\nhands with Hamil, arranged to return in two weeks, and left for\r\nSan Felipe, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him, of course, that Carhart was trying him out.\r\nHamil\'s report on his handling of this might be a factor in\r\nsomething big for him, but even without that he would have done\r\nhis best to put the thing through. Ten years in New York hadn\'t\r\nmade him sentimental and he was quite accustomed to finish\r\neverything he began--and a little bit more.\r\n\r\nAll went well at first. There was no enthusiasm, but each one of\r\nthe seventeen ranchers concerned knew Samuel\'s business, knew\r\nwhat he had behind him, and that they had as little chance of\r\nholding out as flies on a window-pane. Some of them were\r\nresigned--some of them cared like the devil, but they\'d talked\r\nit over, argued it with lawyers and couldn\'t see any possible\r\nloophole. Five of the ranches had oil, the other twelve were\r\npart of the chance, but quite as necessary to Hamil\'s purpose,\r\nin any event.\r\n\r\nSamuel soon saw that the real leader was an early settler named\r\nMcIntyre, a man of perhaps fifty, gray-haired, clean-shaven,\r\nbronzed by forty New Mexico summers, and with those clear steady\r\neye that Texas and New Mexico weather are apt to give. His ranch\r\nhad not as yet shown oil, but it was in the pool, and if any man\r\nhated to lose his land McIntyre did. Every one had rather looked\r\nto him at first to avert the big calamity, and he had hunted all\r\nover the territory for the legal means with which to do it, but\r\nhe had failed, and he knew it. He avoided Samuel assiduously,\r\nbut Samuel was sure that when the day came for the signatures he\r\nwould appear.\r\n\r\nIt came--a baking May day, with hot wave rising off the parched\r\nland as far as eyes could see, and as Samuel sat stewing in his\r\nlittle improvised office--a few chairs, a bench, and a wooden\r\ntable--he was glad the thing was almost over.  He wanted to get\r\nback East the worst way, and join his wife and children for a\r\nweek at the seashore.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was set for four o\'clock, and he was rather\r\nsurprised at three-thirty when the door opened and McIntyre came\r\nin. Samuel could not help respecting the man\'s attitude, and\r\nfeeling a bit sorry for him. McIntyre seemed closely related to\r\nthe prairies, and Samuel had the little flicker of envy that\r\ncity people feel toward men who live in the open.\r\n\r\n"Afternoon," said McIntyre, standing in the open doorway, with\r\nhis feet apart and his hands on his hips.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Mr. McIntyre." Samuel rose, but omitted the formality of\r\noffering his hand. He imagined the rancher cordially loathed\r\nhim, and he hardly blamed him. McIntyre came in and sat down\r\nleisurely.\r\n\r\n"You got us," he said suddenly.\r\n\r\nThis didn\'t seem to require any answer.\r\n\r\n"When I heard Carhart was back of this," he continued, "I gave up."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Carhart is---" began Samuel, but McIntyre waved him silent.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk about the dirty sneak-thief!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. McIntyre," said Samuel briskly, "if this half-hour is to be\r\ndevoted to that sort of talk---"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dry up, young man," McIntyre interrupted, "you can\'t abuse\r\na man who\'d do a thing like this."\r\n\r\nSamuel made no answer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s simply a dirty filch. There just ARE skunks like him too\r\nbig to handle."\r\n\r\n"You\'re being paid liberally," offered Samuel.\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" roared McIntyre suddenly. "I want the privilege of\r\ntalking." He walked to the door and looked out across the land,\r\nthe sunny, steaming pasturage that began almost at his feet and\r\nended with the gray-green of the distant mountains. When he\r\nturned around his mouth was trembling.\r\n\r\n"Do you fellows love Wall Street?" he said hoarsely, "or\r\nwherever you do your dirty scheming---" He paused. "I suppose you\r\ndo. No critter gets so low that he doesn\'t sort of love the\r\nplace he\'s worked, where he\'s sweated out the best he\'s had in\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nSamuel watched him awkwardly. McIntyre wiped his forehead with a\r\nhuge blue handkerchief, and continued:\r\n\r\n"I reckon this rotten old devil had to have another million. I\r\nreckon we\'re just a few of the poor he\'s blotted out to buy a\r\ncouple more carriages or something." He waved his hand toward\r\nthe door. "I built a house out there when I was seventeen, with\r\nthese two hands. I took a wife there at twenty-one, added two\r\nwings, and with four mangy steers I started out. Forty summers\r\nI\'ve saw the sun come up over those mountains and drop down red\r\nas blood in the evening, before the heat drifted off and the\r\nstars came out. I been happy in that house. My boy was born\r\nthere and he died there, late one spring, in the hottest part of\r\nan afternoon like this. Then the wife and I lived there alone\r\nlike we\'d lived before, and sort of tried to have a home, after\r\nall, not a real home but nigh it--cause the boy always seemed\r\naround close, somehow, and we expected a lot of nights to see\r\nhim runnin\' up the path to supper." His voice was shaking so he\r\ncould hardly speak and he turned again to the door, his gray\r\neyes contracted.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my land out there," he said, stretching out his arm, "my\r\nland, by God-- It\'s all I got in the world--and ever wanted." He\r\ndashed his sleeve across his face, and his tone changed as he\r\nturned slowly and faced Samuel. "But I suppose it\'s got to go\r\nwhen they want it--it\'s got to go."\r\n\r\nSamuel had to talk. He felt that in a minute more he would lose\r\nhis head. So he began, as level-voiced as he could--in the sort\r\nof tone he saved for disagreeable duties.\r\n\r\n"It\'s business, Mr. McIntyre," he said. "It\'s inside the law.\r\nPerhaps we couldn\'t have bought out two or three of you at any\r\nprice, but most of you did have a price. Progress demands some\r\nthings---"\r\n\r\nNever had he felt so inadequate, and it was with the greatest\r\nrelief that he heard hoof-beats a few hundred yards away.\r\n\r\nBut at his words the grief in McIntyre\'s eyes had changed to fury.\r\n\r\n"You and your dirty gang of crooks!" he cried. "Not one of you\r\nhas got an honest love for anything on God\'s earth! You\'re a\r\nherd of money-swine!"\r\n\r\nSamuel rose and McIntyre took a step toward him.\r\n\r\n"You long-winded dude. You got our land--take that for Peter\r\nCarhart!"\r\n\r\nHe swung from the shoulder quick as lightning and down went\r\nSamuel in a heap. Dimly he heard steps in the doorway and knew\r\nthat some one was holding McIntyre, but there was no need. The\r\nrancher had sunk down in his chair, and dropped his head in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nSamuel\'s brain was whirring. He realized that the fourth fist\r\nhad hit him, and a great flood of emotion cried out that the law\r\nthat had inexorably ruled his life was in motion again. In a\r\nhalf-daze he got up and strode from the room.\r\n\r\nThe next ten minutes were perhaps the hardest of his life. People\r\ntalk of the courage of convictions, but in actual life a man\'s\r\nduty to his family may make a rigid corpse seem a selfish\r\nindulgence of his own righteousness. Samuel thought mostly of\r\nhis family, yet he never really wavered. That jolt had brought him\r\nto.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back in the room there were a log of worried faces\r\nwaiting for him, but he didn\'t waste any time explaining.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," he said, "Mr. McIntyre has been kind enough to\r\nconvince me that in this matter you are absolutely right and the\r\nPeter Carhart interests absolutely wrong. As far as I am\r\nconcerned you can keep your ranches to the rest of your days."\r\n\r\nHe pushed his way through an astounded gathering, and within a\r\nhalf-hour he had sent two telegrams that staggered the operator\r\ninto complete unfitness for business; one was to Hamil in San\r\nAntonio; one was to Peter Carhart in New York.\r\n\r\nSamuel didn\'t sleep much that night. He knew that for the first\r\ntime in his business career he had made a dismal, miserable\r\nfailure. But some instinct in him, stronger than will, deeper\r\nthan training, had forced him to do what would probably end his\r\nambitions and his happiness. But it was done and it never\r\noccurred to him that he could have acted otherwise.\r\n\r\nNext morning two telegrams were waiting for him. The first was\r\nfrom Hamil. It contained three words:\r\n\r\n"You blamed idiot!"\r\n\r\nThe second was from New York:\r\n\r\n"Deal off come to New York immediately Carhart."\r\n\r\nWithin a week things had happened. Hamil quarrelled furiously\r\nand violently defended his scheme. He was summoned to New York\r\nand spent a bad half-hour on the carpet in Peter Carhart\'s\r\noffice. He broke with the Carhart interests in July, and in\r\nAugust Samuel Meredith, at thirty-five years old, was, to all\r\nintents, made Carhart\'s partner. The fourth fist had done its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI suppose that there\'s a caddish streak in every man that runs\r\ncrosswise across his character and disposition and general\r\noutlook. With some men it\'s secret and we never know it\'s there\r\nuntil they strike us in the dark one night. But Samuel\'s showed\r\nwhen it was in action, and the sight of it made people see red.\r\nHe was rather lucky in that, because every time his little devil\r\ncame up it met a reception that sent it scurrying down below in\r\na sickly, feeble condition. It was the same devil, the same\r\nstreak that made him order Gilly\'s friends off the bed, that\r\nmade him go inside Marjorie\'s house.\r\n\r\nIf you could run your hand along Samuel Meredith\'s jaw you\'d\r\nfeel a lump. He admits he\'s never been sure which fist left it\r\nthere, but he wouldn\'t lose it for anything. He says there\'s no\r\ncad like an old cad, and that sometimes just before making a\r\ndecision, it\'s a great help to stroke his chin. The reporters\r\ncall it a nervous characteristic, but it\'s not that. It\'s so he\r\ncan feel again the gorgeous clarity, the lightning sanity of\r\nthose four fists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Flappers and Philosophers, by F.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
