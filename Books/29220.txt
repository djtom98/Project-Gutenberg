From room to room they\r\nwent, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making sure--a ghostly\r\ncouple.\r\n\r\n"Here we left it," she said. And he added, "Oh, but here too!" "It\'s\r\nupstairs," she murmured. "And in the garden," he whispered. "Quietly,"\r\nthey said, "or we shall wake them."\r\n\r\nBut it wasn\'t that you woke us. Oh, no. "They\'re looking for it; they\'re\r\ndrawing the curtain," one might say, and so read on a page or two. "Now\r\nthey\'ve found it," one would be certain, stopping the pencil on the\r\nmargin. And then, tired of reading, one might rise and see for oneself,\r\nthe house all empty, the doors standing open, only the wood pigeons\r\nbubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from\r\nthe farm. "What did I come in here for? What did I want to find?" My\r\nhands were empty. "Perhaps it\'s upstairs then?" The apples were in the\r\nloft. And so down again, the garden still as ever, only the book had\r\nslipped into the grass.\r\n\r\nBut they had found it in the drawing room. Not that one could ever see\r\nthem. The window panes reflected apples, reflected roses; all the leaves\r\nwere green in the glass. If they moved in the drawing room, the apple\r\nonly turned its yellow side. Yet, the moment after, if the door was\r\nopened, spread about the floor, hung upon the walls, pendant from the\r\nceiling--what? My hands were empty. The shadow of a thrush crossed the\r\ncarpet; from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its\r\nbubble of sound. "Safe, safe, safe," the pulse of the house beat softly.\r\n"The treasure buried; the room ..." the pulse stopped short. Oh, was\r\nthat the buried treasure?\r\n\r\nA moment later the light had faded. Out in the garden then? But the\r\ntrees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. So fine, so rare,\r\ncoolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always burnt behind\r\nthe glass. Death was the glass; death was between us; coming to the\r\nwoman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the house, sealing all the\r\nwindows; the rooms were darkened. He left it, left her, went North, went\r\nEast, saw the stars turned in the Southern sky; sought the house, found\r\nit dropped beneath the Downs. "Safe, safe, safe," the pulse of the house\r\nbeat gladly. "The Treasure yours."\r\n\r\nThe wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop and bend this way and that.\r\nMoonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam of the lamp\r\nfalls straight from the window. The candle burns stiff and still.\r\nWandering through the house, opening the windows, whispering not to wake\r\nus, the ghostly couple seek their joy.\r\n\r\n"Here we slept," she says. And he adds, "Kisses without number." "Waking\r\nin the morning--" "Silver between the trees--" "Upstairs--" "In the\r\ngarden--" "When summer came--" "In winter snowtime--" The doors go\r\nshutting far in the distance, gently knocking like the pulse of a heart.\r\n\r\nNearer they come; cease at the doorway. The wind falls, the rain slides\r\nsilver down the glass. Our eyes darken; we hear no steps beside us; we\r\nsee no lady spread her ghostly cloak. His hands shield the lantern.\r\n"Look," he breathes. "Sound asleep. Love upon their lips."\r\n\r\nStooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and deeply.\r\nLong they pause. The wind drives straightly; the flame stoops slightly.\r\nWild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall, and, meeting, stain\r\nthe faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces that search the sleepers\r\nand seek their hidden joy.\r\n\r\n"Safe, safe, safe," the heart of the house beats proudly. "Long years--"\r\nhe sighs. "Again you found me." "Here," she murmurs, "sleeping; in the\r\ngarden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the loft. Here we left our\r\ntreasure--" Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes. "Safe!\r\nsafe! safe!" the pulse of the house beats wildly. Waking, I cry "Oh, is\r\nthis _your_ buried treasure? The light in the heart."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how it all came about. Six or seven of us were sitting one day\r\nafter tea. Some were gazing across the street into the windows of a\r\nmilliner\'s shop where the light still shone brightly upon scarlet\r\nfeathers and golden slippers. Others were idly occupied in building\r\nlittle towers of sugar upon the edge of the tea tray. After a time, so\r\nfar as I can remember, we drew round the fire and began as usual to\r\npraise men--how strong, how noble, how brilliant, how courageous, how\r\nbeautiful they were--how we envied those who by hook or by crook managed\r\nto get attached to one for life--when Poll, who had said nothing, burst\r\ninto tears. Poll, I must tell you, has always been queer. For one thing\r\nher father was a strange man. He left her a fortune in his will, but on\r\ncondition that she read all the books in the London Library. We\r\ncomforted her as best we could; but we knew in our hearts how vain it\r\nwas. For though we like her, Poll is no beauty; leaves her shoe laces\r\nuntied; and must have been thinking, while we praised men, that not one\r\nof them would ever wish to marry her. At last she dried her tears. For\r\nsome time we could make nothing of what she said. Strange enough it was\r\nin all conscience. She told us that, as we knew, she spent most of her\r\ntime in the London Library, reading. She had begun, she said, with\r\nEnglish literature on the top floor; and was steadily working her way\r\ndown to the _Times_ on the bottom. And now half, or perhaps only a\r\nquarter, way through a terrible thing had happened. She could read no\r\nmore. Books were not what we thought them. "Books," she cried, rising to\r\nher feet and speaking with an intensity of desolation which I shall\r\nnever forget, "are for the most part unutterably bad!"\r\n\r\nOf course we cried out that Shakespeare wrote books, and Milton and\r\nShelley.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," she interrupted us. "You\'ve been well taught, I can see. But\r\nyou are not members of the London Library." Here her sobs broke forth\r\nanew. At length, recovering a little, she opened one of the pile of\r\nbooks which she always carried about with her--"From a Window" or "In a\r\nGarden," or some such name as that it was called, and it was written by\r\na man called Benton or Henson, or something of that kind. She read the\r\nfirst few pages. We listened in silence. "But that\'s not a book,"\r\nsomeone said. So she chose another. This time it was a history, but I\r\nhave forgotten the writer\'s name. Our trepidation increased as she went\r\non. Not a word of it seemed to be true, and the style in which it was\r\nwritten was execrable.\r\n\r\n"Poetry! Poetry!" we cried, impatiently. "Read us poetry!" I cannot\r\ndescribe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume\r\nand mouthed out the verbose, sentimental foolery which it contained.\r\n\r\n"It must have been written by a woman," one of us urged. But no. She\r\ntold us that it was written by a young man, one of the most famous poets\r\nof the day. I leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was.\r\nThough we all cried and begged her to read no more, she persisted and\r\nread us extracts from the Lives of the Lord Chancellors. When she had\r\nfinished, Jane, the eldest and wisest of us, rose to her feet and said\r\nthat she for one was not convinced.\r\n\r\n"Why," she asked, "if men write such rubbish as this, should our mothers\r\nhave wasted their youth in bringing them into the world?"\r\n\r\nWe were all silent; and, in the silence, poor Poll could be heard\r\nsobbing out, "Why, why did my father teach me to read?"\r\n\r\nClorinda was the first to come to her senses. "It\'s all our fault," she\r\nsaid. "Every one of us knows how to read. But no one, save Poll, has\r\never taken the trouble to do it. I, for one, have taken it for granted\r\nthat it was a woman\'s duty to spend her youth in bearing children. I\r\nvenerated my mother for bearing ten; still more my grandmother for\r\nbearing fifteen; it was, I confess, my own ambition to bear twenty. We\r\nhave gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious,\r\nand that their works were of equal merit. While we have borne the\r\nchildren, they, we supposed, have borne the books and the pictures. We\r\nhave populated the world. They have civilized it. But now that we can\r\nread, what prevents us from judging the results? Before we bring another\r\nchild into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world\r\nis like."\r\n\r\nSo we made ourselves into a society for asking questions. One of us was\r\nto visit a man-of-war; another was to hide herself in a scholar\'s study;\r\nanother was to attend a meeting of business men; while all were to read\r\nbooks, look at pictures, go to concerts, keep our eyes open in the\r\nstreets, and ask questions perpetually. We were very young. You can\r\njudge of our simplicity when I tell you that before parting that night\r\nwe agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good\r\nbooks. Our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these\r\nobjects were now attained by men. We vowed solemnly that we would not\r\nbear a single child until we were satisfied.\r\n\r\nOff we went then, some to the British Museum; others to the King\'s Navy;\r\nsome to Oxford; others to Cambridge; we visited the Royal Academy and\r\nthe Tate; heard modern music in concert rooms, went to the Law Courts,\r\nand saw new plays. No one dined out without asking her partner certain\r\nquestions and carefully noting his replies. At intervals we met together\r\nand compared our observations. Oh, those were merry meetings! Never have\r\nI laughed so much as I did when Rose read her notes upon "Honour" and\r\ndescribed how she had dressed herself as an AEthiopian Prince and gone\r\naboard one of His Majesty\'s ships. Discovering the hoax, the Captain\r\nvisited her (now disguised as a private gentleman) and demanded that\r\nhonour should be satisfied. "But how?" she asked. "How?" he bellowed.\r\n"With the cane of course!" Seeing that he was beside himself with rage\r\nand expecting that her last moment had come, she bent over and received,\r\nto her amazement, six light taps upon the behind. "The honour of the\r\nBritish Navy is avenged!" he cried, and, raising herself, she saw him\r\nwith the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand.\r\n"Away!" she exclaimed, striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity\r\nof his own expression, "My honour has still to be satisfied!" "Spoken\r\nlike a gentleman!" he returned, and fell into profound thought. "If six\r\nstrokes avenge the honour of the King\'s Navy," he mused, "how many\r\navenge the honour of a private gentleman?" He said he would prefer to\r\nlay the case before his brother officers. She replied haughtily that she\r\ncould not wait. He praised her sensibility. "Let me see," he cried\r\nsuddenly, "did your father keep a carriage?" "No," she said. "Or a\r\nriding horse!" "We had a donkey," she bethought her, "which drew the\r\nmowing machine." At this his face lighted. "My mother\'s name----" she\r\nadded. "For God\'s sake, man, don\'t mention your mother\'s name!" he\r\nshrieked, trembling like an aspen and flushing to the roots of his hair,\r\nand it was ten minutes at least before she could induce him to proceed.\r\nAt length he decreed that if she gave him four strokes and a half in the\r\nsmall of the back at a spot indicated by himself (the half conceded, he\r\nsaid, in recognition of the fact that her great grandmother\'s uncle was\r\nkilled at Trafalgar) it was his opinion that her honour would be as good\r\nas new. This was done; they retired to a restaurant; drank two bottles\r\nof wine for which he insisted upon paying; and parted with protestations\r\nof eternal friendship.\r\n\r\nThen we had Fanny\'s account of her visit to the Law Courts. At her first\r\nvisit she had come to the conclusion that the Judges were either made\r\nof wood or were impersonated by large animals resembling man who had\r\nbeen trained to move with extreme dignity, mumble and nod their heads.\r\nTo test her theory she had liberated a handkerchief of bluebottles at\r\nthe critical moment of a trial, but was unable to judge whether the\r\ncreatures gave signs of humanity for the buzzing of the flies induced so\r\nsound a sleep that she only woke in time to see the prisoners led into\r\nthe cells below. But from the evidence she brought we voted that it is\r\nunfair to suppose that the Judges are men.\r\n\r\nHelen went to the Royal Academy, but when asked to deliver her report\r\nupon the pictures she began to recite from a pale blue volume, "O! for\r\nthe touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still.\r\nHome is the hunter, home from the hill. He gave his bridle reins a\r\nshake. Love is sweet, love is brief. Spring, the fair spring, is the\r\nyear\'s pleasant King. O! to be in England now that April\'s there. Men\r\nmust work and women must weep. The path of duty is the way to glory--"\r\nWe could listen to no more of this gibberish.\r\n\r\n"We want no more poetry!" we cried.\r\n\r\n"Daughters of England!" she began, but here we pulled her down, a vase\r\nof water getting spilt over her in the scuffle.\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" she exclaimed, shaking herself like a dog. "Now I\'ll roll\r\non the carpet and see if I can\'t brush off what remains of the Union\r\nJack. Then perhaps--" here she rolled energetically. Getting up she\r\nbegan to explain to us what modern pictures are like when Castalia\r\nstopped her.\r\n\r\n"What is the average size of a picture?" she asked. "Perhaps two feet by\r\ntwo and a half," she said. Castalia made notes while Helen spoke, and\r\nwhen she had done, and we were trying not to meet each other\'s eyes,\r\nrose and said, "At your wish I spent last week at Oxbridge, disguised as\r\na charwoman. I thus had access to the rooms of several Professors and\r\nwill now attempt to give you some idea--only," she broke off, "I can\'t\r\nthink how to do it. It\'s all so queer. These Professors," she went on,\r\n"live in large houses built round grass plots each in a kind of cell by\r\nhimself. Yet they have every convenience and comfort. You have only to\r\npress a button or light a little lamp. Their papers are beautifully\r\nfiled. Books abound. There are no children or animals, save half a dozen\r\nstray cats and one aged bullfinch--a cock. I remember," she broke off,\r\n"an Aunt of mine who lived at Dulwich and kept cactuses. You reached the\r\nconservatory through the double drawing-room, and there, on the hot\r\npipes, were dozens of them, ugly, squat, bristly little plants each in a\r\nseparate pot. Once in a hundred years the Aloe flowered, so my Aunt\r\nsaid. But she died before that happened--" We told her to keep to the\r\npoint. "Well," she resumed, "when Professor Hobkin was out, I examined\r\nhis life work, an edition of Sappho. It\'s a queer looking book, six or\r\nseven inches thick, not all by Sappho. Oh, no. Most of it is a defence\r\nof Sappho\'s chastity, which some German had denied, and I can assure you\r\nthe passion with which these two gentlemen argued, the learning they\r\ndisplayed, the prodigious ingenuity with which they disputed the use of\r\nsome implement which looked to me for all the world like a hairpin\r\nastounded me; especially when the door opened and Professor Hobkin\r\nhimself appeared. A very nice, mild, old gentleman, but what could _he_\r\nknow about chastity?" We misunderstood her.\r\n\r\n"No, no," she protested, "he\'s the soul of honour I\'m sure--not that he\r\nresembles Rose\'s sea captain in the least. I was thinking rather of my\r\nAunt\'s cactuses. What could _they_ know about chastity?"\r\n\r\nAgain we told her not to wander from the point,--did the Oxbridge\r\nprofessors help to produce good people and good books?--the objects of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"There!" she exclaimed. "It never struck me to ask. It never occurred\r\nto me that they could possibly produce anything."\r\n\r\n"I believe," said Sue, "that you made some mistake. Probably Professor\r\nHobkin was a gynaecologist. A scholar is a very different sort of man. A\r\nscholar is overflowing with humour and invention--perhaps addicted to\r\nwine, but what of that?--a delightful companion, generous, subtle,\r\nimaginative--as stands to reason. For he spends his life in company with\r\nthe finest human beings that have ever existed."\r\n\r\n"Hum," said Castalia. "Perhaps I\'d better go back and try again."\r\n\r\nSome three months later it happened that I was sitting alone when\r\nCastalia entered. I don\'t know what it was in the look of her that so\r\nmoved me; but I could not restrain myself, and, dashing across the room,\r\nI clasped her in my arms. Not only was she very beautiful; she seemed\r\nalso in the highest spirits. "How happy you look!" I exclaimed, as she\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been at Oxbridge," she said.\r\n\r\n"Asking questions?"\r\n\r\n"Answering them," she replied.\r\n\r\n"You have not broken our vow?" I said anxiously, noticing something\r\nabout her figure.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the vow," she said casually. "I\'m going to have a baby, if that\'s\r\nwhat you mean. You can\'t imagine," she burst out, "how exciting, how\r\nbeautiful, how satisfying--"\r\n\r\n"What is?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"To--to--answer questions," she replied in some confusion. Whereupon she\r\ntold me the whole of her story. But in the middle of an account which\r\ninterested and excited me more than anything I had ever heard, she gave\r\nthe strangest cry, half whoop, half holloa--\r\n\r\n"Chastity! Chastity! Where\'s my chastity!" she cried. "Help Ho! The\r\nscent bottle!"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the room but a cruet containing mustard, which I\r\nwas about to administer when she recovered her composure.\r\n\r\n"You should have thought of that three months ago," I said severely.\r\n\r\n"True," she replied. "There\'s not much good in thinking of it now. It\r\nwas unfortunate, by the way, that my mother had me called Castalia."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Castalia, your mother--" I was beginning when she reached for the\r\nmustard pot.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," she said, shaking her head. "If you\'d been a chaste woman\r\nyourself you would have screamed at the sight of me--instead of which\r\nyou rushed across the room and took me in your arms. No, Cassandra. We\r\nare neither of us chaste." So we went on talking.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the room was filling up, for it was the day appointed to\r\ndiscuss the results of our observations. Everyone, I thought, felt as I\r\ndid about Castalia. They kissed her and said how glad they were to see\r\nher again. At length, when we were all assembled, Jane rose and said\r\nthat it was time to begin. She began by saying that we had now asked\r\nquestions for over five years, and that though the results were bound to\r\nbe inconclusive--here Castalia nudged me and whispered that she was not\r\nso sure about that. Then she got up, and, interrupting Jane in the\r\nmiddle of a sentence, said:\r\n\r\n"Before you say any more, I want to know--am I to stay in the room?\r\nBecause," she added, "I have to confess that I am an impure woman."\r\n\r\nEveryone looked at her in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"You are going to have a baby?" asked Jane.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head.\r\n\r\nIt was extraordinary to see the different expressions on their faces. A\r\nsort of hum went through the room, in which I could catch the words\r\n"impure," "baby," "Castalia," and so on. Jane, who was herself\r\nconsiderably moved, put it to us:\r\n\r\n"Shall she go? Is she impure?"\r\n\r\nSuch a roar filled the room as might have been heard in the street\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n"No! No! No! Let her stay! Impure? Fiddlesticks!" Yet I fancied that\r\nsome of the youngest, girls of nineteen or twenty, held back as if\r\novercome with shyness. Then we all came about her and began asking\r\nquestions, and at last I saw one of the youngest, who had kept in the\r\nbackground, approach shyly and say to her:\r\n\r\n"What is chastity then? I mean is it good, or is it bad, or is it\r\nnothing at all?" She replied so low that I could not catch what she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"You know I was shocked," said another, "for at least ten minutes."\r\n\r\n"In my opinion," said Poll, who was growing crusty from always reading\r\nin the London Library, "chastity is nothing but ignorance--a most\r\ndiscreditable state of mind. We should admit only the unchaste to our\r\nsociety. I vote that Castalia shall be our President."\r\n\r\nThis was violently disputed.\r\n\r\n"It is as unfair to brand women with chastity as with unchastity," said\r\nPoll. "Some of us haven\'t the opportunity either. Moreover, I don\'t\r\nbelieve Cassy herself maintains that she acted as she did from a pure\r\nlove of knowledge."\r\n\r\n"He is only twenty-one and divinely beautiful," said Cassy, with a\r\nravishing gesture.\r\n\r\n"I move," said Helen, "that no one be allowed to talk of chastity or\r\nunchastity save those who are in love."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother," said Judith, who had been enquiring into scientific\r\nmatters, "I\'m not in love and I\'m longing to explain my measures for\r\ndispensing with prostitutes and fertilizing virgins by Act of\r\nParliament."\r\n\r\nShe went on to tell us of an invention of hers to be erected at Tube\r\nstations and other public resorts, which, upon payment of a small fee,\r\nwould safeguard the nation\'s health, accommodate its sons, and relieve\r\nits daughters. Then she had contrived a method of preserving in sealed\r\ntubes the germs of future Lord Chancellors "or poets or painters or\r\nmusicians," she went on, "supposing, that is to say, that these breeds\r\nare not extinct, and that women still wish to bear children----"\r\n\r\n"Of course we wish to bear children!" cried Castalia, impatiently. Jane\r\nrapped the table.\r\n\r\n"That is the very point we are met to consider," she said. "For five\r\nyears we have been trying to find out whether we are justified in\r\ncontinuing the human race. Castalia has anticipated our decision. But it\r\nremains for the rest of us to make up our minds."\r\n\r\nHere one after another of our messengers rose and delivered their\r\nreports. The marvels of civilisation far exceeded our expectations, and,\r\nas we learnt for the first time how man flies in the air, talks across\r\nspace, penetrates to the heart of an atom, and embraces the universe in\r\nhis speculations, a murmur of admiration burst from our lips.\r\n\r\n"We are proud," we cried, "that our mothers sacrificed their youth in\r\nsuch a cause as this!" Castalia, who had been listening intently, looked\r\nprouder than all the rest. Then Jane reminded us that we had still much\r\nto learn, and Castalia begged us to make haste. On we went through a\r\nvast tangle of statistics. We learnt that England has a population of\r\nso many millions, and that such and such a proportion of them is\r\nconstantly hungry and in prison; that the average size of a working\r\nman\'s family is such, and that so great a percentage of women die from\r\nmaladies incident to childbirth. Reports were read of visits to\r\nfactories, shops, slums, and dockyards. Descriptions were given of the\r\nStock Exchange, of a gigantic house of business in the City, and of a\r\nGovernment Office. The British Colonies were now discussed, and some\r\naccount was given of our rule in India, Africa and Ireland. I was\r\nsitting by Castalia and I noticed her uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"We shall never come to any conclusion at all at this rate," she said.\r\n"As it appears that civilisation is so much more complex than we had any\r\nnotion, would it not be better to confine ourselves to our original\r\nenquiry? We agreed that it was the object of life to produce good people\r\nand good books. All this time we have been talking of aeroplanes,\r\nfactories, and money. Let us talk about men themselves and their arts,\r\nfor that is the heart of the matter."\r\n\r\nSo the diners out stepped forward with long slips of paper containing\r\nanswers to their questions. These had been framed after much\r\nconsideration. A good man, we had agreed, must at any rate be honest,\r\npassionate, and unworldly. But whether or not a particular man possessed\r\nthose qualities could only be discovered by asking questions, often\r\nbeginning at a remote distance from the centre. Is Kensington a nice\r\nplace to live in? Where is your son being educated--and your daughter?\r\nNow please tell me, what do you pay for your cigars? By the way, is Sir\r\nJoseph a baronet or only a knight? Often it seemed that we learnt more\r\nfrom trivial questions of this kind than from more direct ones. "I\r\naccepted my peerage," said Lord Bunkum, "because my wife wished it." I\r\nforget how many titles were accepted for the same reason. "Working\r\nfifteen hours out of the twenty-four, as I do----" ten thousand\r\nprofessional men began.\r\n\r\n"No, no, of course you can neither read nor write. But why do you work\r\nso hard?" "My dear lady, with a growing family----" "But _why_ does your\r\nfamily grow?" Their wives wished that too, or perhaps it was the British\r\nEmpire. But more significant than the answers were the refusals to\r\nanswer. Very few would reply at all to questions about morality and\r\nreligion, and such answers as were given were not serious. Questions as\r\nto the value of money and power were almost invariably brushed aside, or\r\npressed at extreme risk to the asker. "I\'m sure," said Jill, "that if\r\nSir Harley Tightboots hadn\'t been carving the mutton when I asked him\r\nabout the capitalist system he would have cut my throat. The only reason\r\nwhy we escaped with our lives over and over again is that men are at\r\nonce so hungry and so chivalrous. They despise us too much to mind what\r\nwe say."\r\n\r\n"Of course they despise us," said Eleanor. "At the same time how do you\r\naccount for this--I made enquiries among the artists. Now, no woman has\r\never been an artist, has she, Poll?"\r\n\r\n"Jane-Austen-Charlotte-Bronte-George-Eliot," cried Poll, like a man\r\ncrying muffins in a back street.\r\n\r\n"Damn the woman!" someone exclaimed. "What a bore she is!"\r\n\r\n"Since Sappho there has been no female of first rate----" Eleanor began,\r\nquoting from a weekly newspaper.\r\n\r\n"It\'s now well known that Sappho was the somewhat lewd invention of\r\nProfessor Hobkin," Ruth interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, there is no reason to suppose that any woman ever has been able\r\nto write or ever will be able to write," Eleanor continued. "And yet,\r\nwhenever I go among authors they never cease to talk to me about their\r\nbooks. Masterly! I say, or Shakespeare himself! (for one must say\r\nsomething) and I assure you, they believe me."\r\n\r\n"That proves nothing," said Jane. "They all do it. Only," she sighed,\r\n"it doesn\'t seem to help _us_ much. Perhaps we had better examine modern\r\nliterature next. Liz, it\'s your turn."\r\n\r\nElizabeth rose and said that in order to prosecute her enquiry she had\r\ndressed as a man and been taken for a reviewer.\r\n\r\n"I have read new books pretty steadily for the past five years," said\r\nshe. "Mr. Wells is the most popular living writer; then comes Mr. Arnold\r\nBennett; then Mr. Compton Mackenzie; Mr. McKenna and Mr. Walpole may be\r\nbracketed together." She sat down.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve told us nothing!" we expostulated. "Or do you mean that\r\nthese gentlemen have greatly surpassed Jane-Elliot and that English\r\nfiction is----where\'s that review of yours? Oh, yes, \'safe in their\r\nhands.\'"\r\n\r\n"Safe, quite safe," she said, shifting uneasily from foot to foot. "And\r\nI\'m sure that they give away even more than they receive."\r\n\r\nWe were all sure of that. "But," we pressed her, "do they write good\r\nbooks?"\r\n\r\n"Good books?" she said, looking at the ceiling. "You must remember," she\r\nbegan, speaking with extreme rapidity, "that fiction is the mirror of\r\nlife. And you can\'t deny that education is of the highest importance,\r\nand that it would be extremely annoying, if you found yourself alone at\r\nBrighton late at night, not to know which was the best boarding house to\r\nstay at, and suppose it was a dripping Sunday evening--wouldn\'t it be\r\nnice to go to the Movies?"\r\n\r\n"But what has that got to do with it?" we asked.\r\n\r\n"Nothing--nothing--nothing whatever," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Well, tell us the truth," we bade her.\r\n\r\n"The truth? But isn\'t it wonderful," she broke off--"Mr. Chitter has\r\nwritten a weekly article for the past thirty years upon love or hot\r\nbuttered toast and has sent all his sons to Eton----"\r\n\r\n"The truth!" we demanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the truth," she stammered, "the truth has nothing to do with\r\nliterature," and sitting down she refused to say another word.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed to us very inconclusive.\r\n\r\n"Ladies, we must try to sum up the results," Jane was beginning, when a\r\nhum, which had been heard for some time through the open window, drowned\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n"War! War! War! Declaration of War!" men were shouting in the street\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other in horror.\r\n\r\n"What war?" we cried. "What war?" We remembered, too late, that we had\r\nnever thought of sending anyone to the House of Commons. We had\r\nforgotten all about it. We turned to Poll, who had reached the history\r\nshelves in the London Library, and asked her to enlighten us.\r\n\r\n"Why," we cried, "do men go to war?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes for one reason, sometimes for another," she replied calmly.\r\n"In 1760, for example----" The shouts outside drowned her words. "Again\r\nin 1797--in 1804--It was the Austrians in 1866--1870 was the\r\nFranco-Prussian--In 1900 on the other hand----"\r\n\r\n"But it\'s now 1914!" we cut her short.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I don\'t know what they\'re going to war for now," she admitted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe war was over and peace was in process of being signed, when I once\r\nmore found myself with Castalia in the room where our meetings used to\r\nbe held. We began idly turning over the pages of our old minute books.\r\n"Queer," I mused, "to see what we were thinking five years ago." "We are\r\nagreed," Castalia quoted, reading over my shoulder, "that it is the\r\nobject of life to produce good people and good books." We made no\r\ncomment upon _that_. "A good man is at any rate honest, passionate and\r\nunworldly." "What a woman\'s language!" I observed. "Oh, dear," cried\r\nCastalia, pushing the book away from her, "what fools we were! It was\r\nall Poll\'s father\'s fault," she went on. "I believe he did it on\r\npurpose--that ridiculous will, I mean, forcing Poll to read all the\r\nbooks in the London Library. If we hadn\'t learnt to read," she said\r\nbitterly, "we might still have been bearing children in ignorance and\r\nthat I believe was the happiest life after all. I know what you\'re going\r\nto say about war," she checked me, "and the horror of bearing children\r\nto see them killed, but our mothers did it, and their mothers, and their\r\nmothers before them. And _they_ didn\'t complain. They couldn\'t read.\r\nI\'ve done my best," she sighed, "to prevent my little girl from learning\r\nto read, but what\'s the use? I caught Ann only yesterday with a\r\nnewspaper in her hand and she was beginning to ask me if it was \'true.\'\r\nNext she\'ll ask me whether Mr. Lloyd George is a good man, then whether\r\nMr. Arnold Bennett is a good novelist, and finally whether I believe in\r\nGod. How can I bring my daughter up to believe in nothing?" she\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n"Surely you could teach her to believe that a man\'s intellect is, and\r\nalways will be, fundamentally superior to a woman\'s?" I suggested. She\r\nbrightened at this and began to turn over our old minutes again. "Yes,"\r\nshe said, "think of their discoveries, their mathematics, their science,\r\ntheir philosophy, their scholarship----" and then she began to laugh, "I\r\nshall never forget old Hobkin and the hairpin," she said, and went on\r\nreading and laughing and I thought she was quite happy, when suddenly\r\nshe drew the book from her and burst out, "Oh, Cassandra, why do you\r\ntorment me? Don\'t you know that our belief in man\'s intellect is the\r\ngreatest fallacy of them all?" "What?" I exclaimed. "Ask any journalist,\r\nschoolmaster, politician or public house keeper in the land and they\r\nwill all tell you that men are much cleverer than women." "As if I\r\ndoubted it," she said scornfully. "How could they help it? Haven\'t we\r\nbred them and fed and kept them in comfort since the beginning of time\r\nso that they may be clever even if they\'re nothing else? It\'s all our\r\ndoing!" she cried. "We insisted upon having intellect and now we\'ve got\r\nit. And it\'s intellect," she continued, "that\'s at the bottom of it.\r\nWhat could be more charming than a boy before he has begun to cultivate\r\nhis intellect? He is beautiful to look at; he gives himself no airs; he\r\nunderstands the meaning of art and literature instinctively; he goes\r\nabout enjoying his life and making other people enjoy theirs. Then they\r\nteach him to cultivate his intellect. He becomes a barrister, a civil\r\nservant, a general, an author, a professor. Every day he goes to an\r\noffice. Every year he produces a book. He maintains a whole family by\r\nthe products of his brain--poor devil! Soon he cannot come into a room\r\nwithout making us all feel uncomfortable; he condescends to every woman\r\nhe meets, and dares not tell the truth even to his own wife; instead of\r\nrejoicing our eyes we have to shut them if we are to take him in our\r\narms. True, they console themselves with stars of all shapes, ribbons\r\nof all shades, and incomes of all sizes--but what is to console us? That\r\nwe shall be able in ten years\' time to spend a week-end at Lahore? Or\r\nthat the least insect in Japan has a name twice the length of its body?\r\nOh, Cassandra, for Heaven\'s sake let us devise a method by which men may\r\nbear children! It is our only chance. For unless we provide them with\r\nsome innocent occupation we shall get neither good people nor good\r\nbooks; we shall perish beneath the fruits of their unbridled activity;\r\nand not a human being will survive to know that there once was\r\nShakespeare!"\r\n\r\n"It is too late," I replied. "We cannot provide even for the children\r\nthat we have."\r\n\r\n"And then you ask me to believe in intellect," she said.\r\n\r\nWhile we spoke, men were crying hoarsely and wearily in the street, and,\r\nlistening, we heard that the Treaty of Peace had just been signed. The\r\nvoices died away. The rain was falling and interfered no doubt with the\r\nproper explosion of the fireworks.\r\n\r\n"My cook will have bought the Evening News," said Castalia, "and Ann\r\nwill be spelling it out over her tea. I must go home."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good--not a bit of good," I said. "Once she knows how to read\r\nthere\'s only one thing you can teach her to believe in--and that is\r\nherself."\r\n\r\n"Well, that would be a change," sighed Castalia.\r\n\r\nSo we swept up the papers of our Society, and, though Ann was playing\r\nwith her doll very happily, we solemnly made her a present of the lot\r\nand told her we had chosen her to be President of the Society of the\r\nfuture--upon which she burst into tears, poor little girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY OR TUESDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nLazy and indifferent, shaking space easily from his wings, knowing his\r\nway, the heron passes over the church beneath the sky. White and\r\ndistant, absorbed in itself, endlessly the sky covers and uncovers,\r\nmoves and remains. A lake? Blot the shores of it out! A mountain? Oh,\r\nperfect--the sun gold on its slopes. Down that falls. Ferns then, or\r\nwhite feathers, for ever and ever----\r\n\r\nDesiring truth, awaiting it, laboriously distilling a few words, for\r\never desiring--(a cry starts to the left, another to the right. Wheels\r\nstrike divergently. Omnibuses conglomerate in conflict)--for ever\r\ndesiring--(the clock asseverates with twelve distinct strokes that it is\r\nmidday; light sheds gold scales; children swarm)--for ever desiring\r\ntruth. Red is the dome; coins hang on the trees; smoke trails from the\r\nchimneys; bark, shout, cry "Iron for sale"--and truth?\r\n\r\nRadiating to a point men\'s feet and women\'s feet, black or\r\ngold-encrusted--(This foggy weather--Sugar? No, thank you--The\r\ncommonwealth of the future)--the firelight darting and making the room\r\nred, save for the black figures and their bright eyes, while outside a\r\nvan discharges, Miss Thingummy drinks tea at her desk, and plate-glass\r\npreserves fur coats----\r\n\r\nFlaunted, leaf-light, drifting at corners, blown across the wheels,\r\nsilver-splashed, home or not home, gathered, scattered, squandered in\r\nseparate scales, swept up, down, torn, sunk, assembled--and truth?\r\n\r\nNow to recollect by the fireside on the white square of marble. From\r\nivory depths words rising shed their blackness, blossom and penetrate.\r\nFallen the book; in the flame, in the smoke, in the momentary sparks--or\r\nnow voyaging, the marble square pendant, minarets beneath and the\r\nIndian seas, while space rushes blue and stars glint--truth? or now,\r\ncontent with closeness?\r\n\r\nLazy and indifferent the heron returns; the sky veils her stars; then\r\nbares them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNWRITTEN NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch an expression of unhappiness was enough by itself to make one\'s\r\neyes slide above the paper\'s edge to the poor woman\'s\r\nface--insignificant without that look, almost a symbol of human destiny\r\nwith it. Life\'s what you see in people\'s eyes; life\'s what they learn,\r\nand, having learnt it, never, though they seek to hide it, cease to be\r\naware of--what? That life\'s like that, it seems. Five faces\r\nopposite--five mature faces--and the knowledge in each face. Strange,\r\nthough, how people want to conceal it! Marks of reticence are on all\r\nthose faces: lips shut, eyes shaded, each one of the five doing\r\nsomething to hide or stultify his knowledge. One smokes; another reads;\r\na third checks entries in a pocket book; a fourth stares at the map of\r\nthe line framed opposite; and the fifth--the terrible thing about the\r\nfifth is that she does nothing at all. She looks at life. Ah, but my\r\npoor, unfortunate woman, do play the game--do, for all our sakes,\r\nconceal it!\r\n\r\nAs if she heard me, she looked up, shifted slightly in her seat and\r\nsighed. She seemed to apologise and at the same time to say to me, "If\r\nonly you knew!" Then she looked at life again. "But I do know," I\r\nanswered silently, glancing at the _Times_ for manners\' sake. "I know\r\nthe whole business. \'Peace between Germany and the Allied Powers was\r\nyesterday officially ushered in at Paris--Signor Nitti, the Italian\r\nPrime Minister--a passenger train at Doncaster was in collision with a\r\ngoods train....\' We all know--the _Times_ knows--but we pretend we\r\ndon\'t." My eyes had once more crept over the paper\'s rim. She shuddered,\r\ntwitched her arm queerly to the middle of her back and shook her head.\r\nAgain I dipped into my great reservoir of life. "Take what you like," I\r\ncontinued, "births, deaths, marriages, Court Circular, the habits of\r\nbirds, Leonardo da Vinci, the Sandhills murder, high wages and the cost\r\nof living--oh, take what you like," I repeated, "it\'s all in the\r\n_Times_!" Again with infinite weariness she moved her head from side to\r\nside until, like a top exhausted with spinning, it settled on her neck.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ was no protection against such sorrow as hers. But other\r\nhuman beings forbade intercourse. The best thing to do against life was\r\nto fold the paper so that it made a perfect square, crisp, thick,\r\nimpervious even to life. This done, I glanced up quickly, armed with a\r\nshield of my own. She pierced through my shield; she gazed into my eyes\r\nas if searching any sediment of courage at the depths of them and\r\ndamping it to clay. Her twitch alone denied all hope, discounted all\r\nillusion.\r\n\r\nSo we rattled through Surrey and across the border into Sussex. But with\r\nmy eyes upon life I did not see that the other travellers had left, one\r\nby one, till, save for the man who read, we were alone together. Here\r\nwas Three Bridges station. We drew slowly down the platform and\r\nstopped. Was he going to leave us? I prayed both ways--I prayed last\r\nthat he might stay. At that instant he roused himself, crumpled his\r\npaper contemptuously, like a thing done with, burst open the door, and\r\nleft us alone.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy woman, leaning a little forward, palely and colourlessly\r\naddressed me--talked of stations and holidays, of brothers at\r\nEastbourne, and the time of year, which was, I forget now, early or\r\nlate. But at last looking from the window and seeing, I knew, only life,\r\nshe breathed, "Staying away--that\'s the drawback of it----" Ah, now we\r\napproached the catastrophe, "My sister-in-law"--the bitterness of her\r\ntone was like lemon on cold steel, and speaking, not to me, but to\r\nherself, she muttered, "nonsense, she would say--that\'s what they all\r\nsay," and while she spoke she fidgeted as though the skin on her back\r\nwere as a plucked fowl\'s in a poulterer\'s shop-window.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that cow!" she broke off nervously, as though the great wooden cow\r\nin the meadow had shocked her and saved her from some indiscretion. Then\r\nshe shuddered, and then she made the awkward angular movement that I had\r\nseen before, as if, after the spasm, some spot between the shoulders\r\nburnt or itched. Then again she looked the most unhappy woman in the\r\nworld, and I once more reproached her, though not with the same\r\nconviction, for if there were a reason, and if I knew the reason, the\r\nstigma was removed from life.\r\n\r\n"Sisters-in-law," I said--\r\n\r\nHer lips pursed as if to spit venom at the word; pursed they remained.\r\nAll she did was to take her glove and rub hard at a spot on the\r\nwindow-pane. She rubbed as if she would rub something out for ever--some\r\nstain, some indelible contamination. Indeed, the spot remained for all\r\nher rubbing, and back she sank with the shudder and the clutch of the\r\narm I had come to expect. Something impelled me to take my glove and rub\r\nmy window. There, too, was a little speck on the glass. For all my\r\nrubbing it remained. And then the spasm went through me; I crooked my\r\narm and plucked at the middle of my back. My skin, too, felt like the\r\ndamp chicken\'s skin in the poulterer\'s shop-window; one spot between the\r\nshoulders itched and irritated, felt clammy, felt raw. Could I reach it?\r\nSurreptitiously I tried. She saw me. A smile of infinite irony, infinite\r\nsorrow, flitted and faded from her face. But she had communicated,\r\nshared her secret, passed her poison; she would speak no more. Leaning\r\nback in my corner, shielding my eyes from her eyes, seeing only the\r\nslopes and hollows, greys and purples, of the winter\'s landscape, I read\r\nher message, deciphered her secret, reading it beneath her gaze.\r\n\r\nHilda\'s the sister-in-law. Hilda? Hilda? Hilda Marsh--Hilda the\r\nblooming, the full bosomed, the matronly. Hilda stands at the door as\r\nthe cab draws up, holding a coin. "Poor Minnie, more of a grasshopper\r\nthan ever--old cloak she had last year. Well, well, with two children\r\nthese days one can\'t do more. No, Minnie, I\'ve got it; here you are,\r\ncabby--none of your ways with me. Come in, Minnie. Oh, I could carry\r\n_you_, let alone your basket!" So they go into the dining-room. "Aunt\r\nMinnie, children."\r\n\r\nSlowly the knives and forks sink from the upright. Down they get (Bob\r\nand Barbara), hold out hands stiffly; back again to their chairs,\r\nstaring between the resumed mouthfuls. [But this we\'ll skip; ornaments,\r\ncurtains, trefoil china plate, yellow oblongs of cheese, white squares\r\nof biscuit--skip--oh, but wait! Halfway through luncheon one of those\r\nshivers; Bob stares at her, spoon in mouth. "Get on with your pudding,\r\nBob;" but Hilda disapproves. "Why _should_ she twitch?" Skip, skip, till\r\nwe reach the landing on the upper floor; stairs brass-bound; linoleum\r\nworn; oh, yes! little bedroom looking out over the roofs of\r\nEastbourne--zigzagging roofs like the spines of caterpillars, this way,\r\nthat way, striped red and yellow, with blue-black slating]. Now, Minnie,\r\nthe door\'s shut; Hilda heavily descends to the basement; you unstrap the\r\nstraps of your basket, lay on the bed a meagre nightgown, stand side by\r\nside furred felt slippers. The looking-glass--no, you avoid the\r\nlooking-glass. Some methodical disposition of hat-pins. Perhaps the\r\nshell box has something in it? You shake it; it\'s the pearl stud there\r\nwas last year--that\'s all. And then the sniff, the sigh, the sitting by\r\nthe window. Three o\'clock on a December afternoon; the rain drizzling;\r\none light low in the skylight of a drapery emporium; another high in a\r\nservant\'s bedroom--this one goes out. That gives her nothing to look at.\r\nA moment\'s blankness--then, what are you thinking? (Let me peep across\r\nat her opposite; she\'s asleep or pretending it; so what would she think\r\nabout sitting at the window at three o\'clock in the afternoon? Health,\r\nmoney, hills, her God?) Yes, sitting on the very edge of the chair\r\nlooking over the roofs of Eastbourne, Minnie Marsh prays to God. That\'s\r\nall very well; and she may rub the pane too, as though to see God\r\nbetter; but what God does she see? Who\'s the God of Minnie Marsh, the\r\nGod of the back streets of Eastbourne, the God of three o\'clock in the\r\nafternoon? I, too, see roofs, I see sky; but, oh, dear--this seeing of\r\nGods! More like President Kruger than Prince Albert--that\'s the best I\r\ncan do for him; and I see him on a chair, in a black frock-coat, not so\r\nvery high up either; I can manage a cloud or two for him to sit on; and\r\nthen his hand trailing in the cloud holds a rod, a truncheon is\r\nit?--black, thick, thorned--a brutal old bully--Minnie\'s God! Did he\r\nsend the itch and the patch and the twitch? Is that why she prays? What\r\nshe rubs on the window is the stain of sin. Oh, she committed some\r\ncrime!\r\n\r\nI have my choice of crimes. The woods flit and fly--in summer there are\r\nbluebells; in the opening there, when Spring comes, primroses. A\r\nparting, was it, twenty years ago? Vows broken? Not Minnie\'s!... She\r\nwas faithful. How she nursed her mother! All her savings on the\r\ntombstone--wreaths under glass--daffodils in jars. But I\'m off the\r\ntrack. A crime.... They would say she kept her sorrow, suppressed her\r\nsecret--her sex, they\'d say--the scientific people. But what flummery to\r\nsaddle _her_ with sex! No--more like this. Passing down the streets of\r\nCroydon twenty years ago, the violet loops of ribbon in the draper\'s\r\nwindow spangled in the electric light catch her eye. She lingers--past\r\nsix. Still by running she can reach home. She pushes through the glass\r\nswing door. It\'s sale-time. Shallow trays brim with ribbons. She pauses,\r\npulls this, fingers that with the raised roses on it--no need to choose,\r\nno need to buy, and each tray with its surprises. "We don\'t shut till\r\nseven," and then it _is_ seven. She runs, she rushes, home she reaches,\r\nbut too late. Neighbours--the doctor--baby brother--the\r\nkettle--scalded--hospital--dead--or only the shock of it, the blame?\r\nAh, but the detail matters nothing! It\'s what she carries with her; the\r\nspot, the crime, the thing to expiate, always there between her\r\nshoulders. "Yes," she seems to nod to me, "it\'s the thing I did."\r\n\r\nWhether you did, or what you did, I don\'t mind; it\'s not the thing I\r\nwant. The draper\'s window looped with violet--that\'ll do; a little cheap\r\nperhaps, a little commonplace--since one has a choice of crimes, but\r\nthen so many (let me peep across again--still sleeping, or pretending\r\nsleep! white, worn, the mouth closed--a touch of obstinacy, more than\r\none would think--no hint of sex)--so many crimes aren\'t _your_ crime;\r\nyour crime was cheap; only the retribution solemn; for now the church\r\ndoor opens, the hard wooden pew receives her; on the brown tiles she\r\nkneels; every day, winter, summer, dusk, dawn (here she\'s at it) prays.\r\nAll her sins fall, fall, for ever fall. The spot receives them. It\'s\r\nraised, it\'s red, it\'s burning. Next she twitches. Small boys point.\r\n"Bob at lunch to-day"--But elderly women are the worst.\r\n\r\nIndeed now you can\'t sit praying any longer. Kruger\'s sunk beneath the\r\nclouds--washed over as with a painter\'s brush of liquid grey, to which\r\nhe adds a tinge of black--even the tip of the truncheon gone now. That\'s\r\nwhat always happens! Just as you\'ve seen him, felt him, someone\r\ninterrupts. It\'s Hilda now.\r\n\r\nHow you hate her! She\'ll even lock the bathroom door overnight, too,\r\nthough it\'s only cold water you want, and sometimes when the night\'s\r\nbeen bad it seems as if washing helped. And John at breakfast--the\r\nchildren--meals are worst, and sometimes there are friends--ferns don\'t\r\naltogether hide \'em--they guess, too; so out you go along the front,\r\nwhere the waves are grey, and the papers blow, and the glass shelters\r\ngreen and draughty, and the chairs cost tuppence--too much--for there\r\nmust be preachers along the sands. Ah, that\'s a nigger--that\'s a funny\r\nman--that\'s a man with parakeets--poor little creatures! Is there no\r\none here who thinks of God?--just up there, over the pier, with his\r\nrod--but no--there\'s nothing but grey in the sky or if it\'s blue the\r\nwhite clouds hide him, and the music--it\'s military music--and what they\r\nare fishing for? Do they catch them? How the children stare! Well, then\r\nhome a back way--"Home a back way!" The words have meaning; might have\r\nbeen spoken by the old man with whiskers--no, no, he didn\'t really\r\nspeak; but everything has meaning--placards leaning against\r\ndoorways--names above shop-windows--red fruit in baskets--women\'s heads\r\nin the hairdresser\'s--all say "Minnie Marsh!" But here\'s a jerk. "Eggs\r\nare cheaper!" That\'s what always happens! I was heading her over the\r\nwaterfall, straight for madness, when, like a flock of dream sheep, she\r\nturns t\'other way and runs between my fingers. Eggs are cheaper.\r\nTethered to the shores of the world, none of the crimes, sorrows,\r\nrhapsodies, or insanities for poor Minnie Marsh; never late for\r\nluncheon; never caught in a storm without a mackintosh; never utterly\r\nunconscious of the cheapness of eggs. So she reaches home--scrapes her\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nHave I read you right? But the human face--the human face at the top of\r\nthe fullest sheet of print holds more, withholds more. Now, eyes open,\r\nshe looks out; and in the human eye--how d\'you define it?--there\'s a\r\nbreak--a division--so that when you\'ve grasped the stem the butterfly\'s\r\noff--the moth that hangs in the evening over the yellow flower--move,\r\nraise your hand, off, high, away. I won\'t raise my hand. Hang still,\r\nthen, quiver, life, soul, spirit, whatever you are of Minnie Marsh--I,\r\ntoo, on my flower--the hawk over the down--alone, or what were the worth\r\nof life? To rise; hang still in the evening, in the midday; hang still\r\nover the down. The flicker of a hand--off, up! then poised again. Alone,\r\nunseen; seeing all so still down there, all so lovely. None seeing, none\r\ncaring. The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages. Air\r\nabove, air below. And the moon and immortality.... Oh, but I drop to the\r\nturf! Are you down too, you in the corner, what\'s your\r\nname--woman--Minnie Marsh; some such name as that? There she is, tight\r\nto her blossom; opening her hand-bag, from which she takes a hollow\r\nshell--an egg--who was saying that eggs were cheaper? You or I? Oh, it\r\nwas you who said it on the way home, you remember, when the old\r\ngentleman, suddenly opening his umbrella--or sneezing was it? Anyhow,\r\nKruger went, and you came "home a back way," and scraped your boots.\r\nYes. And now you lay across your knees a pocket-handkerchief into which\r\ndrop little angular fragments of eggshell--fragments of a map--a puzzle.\r\nI wish I could piece them together! If you would only sit still. She\'s\r\nmoved her knees--the map\'s in bits again. Down the slopes of the Andes\r\nthe white blocks of marble go bounding and hurtling, crushing to death a\r\nwhole troop of Spanish muleteers, with their convoy--Drake\'s booty,\r\ngold and silver. But to return----\r\n\r\nTo what, to where? She opened the door, and, putting her umbrella in the\r\nstand--that goes without saying; so, too, the whiff of beef from the\r\nbasement; dot, dot, dot. But what I cannot thus eliminate, what I must,\r\nhead down, eyes shut, with the courage of a battalion and the blindness\r\nof a bull, charge and disperse are, indubitably, the figures behind the\r\nferns, commercial travellers. There I\'ve hidden them all this time in\r\nthe hope that somehow they\'d disappear, or better still emerge, as\r\nindeed they must, if the story\'s to go on gathering richness and\r\nrotundity, destiny and tragedy, as stories should, rolling along with it\r\ntwo, if not three, commercial travellers and a whole grove of\r\naspidistra. "The fronds of the aspidistra only partly concealed the\r\ncommercial traveller--" Rhododendrons would conceal him utterly, and\r\ninto the bargain give me my fling of red and white, for which I starve\r\nand strive; but rhododendrons in Eastbourne--in December--on the\r\nMarshes\' table--no, no, I dare not; it\'s all a matter of crusts and\r\ncruets, frills and ferns. Perhaps there\'ll be a moment later by the sea.\r\nMoreover, I feel, pleasantly pricking through the green fretwork and\r\nover the glacis of cut glass, a desire to peer and peep at the man\r\nopposite--one\'s as much as I can manage. James Moggridge is it, whom the\r\nMarshes call Jimmy? [Minnie, you must promise not to twitch till I\'ve\r\ngot this straight]. James Moggridge travels in--shall we say\r\nbuttons?--but the time\'s not come for bringing _them_ in--the big and\r\nthe little on the long cards, some peacock-eyed, others dull gold;\r\ncairngorms some, and others coral sprays--but I say the time\'s not come.\r\nHe travels, and on Thursdays, his Eastbourne day, takes his meals with\r\nthe Marshes. His red face, his little steady eyes--by no means\r\naltogether commonplace--his enormous appetite (that\'s safe; he won\'t\r\nlook at Minnie till the bread\'s swamped the gravy dry), napkin tucked\r\ndiamond-wise--but this is primitive, and, whatever it may do the reader,\r\ndon\'t take me in. Let\'s dodge to the Moggridge household, set that in\r\nmotion. Well, the family boots are mended on Sundays by James himself.\r\nHe reads _Truth_. But his passion? Roses--and his wife a retired\r\nhospital nurse--interesting--for God\'s sake let me have one woman with a\r\nname I like! But no; she\'s of the unborn children of the mind, illicit,\r\nnone the less loved, like my rhododendrons. How many die in every novel\r\nthat\'s written--the best, the dearest, while Moggridge lives. It\'s\r\nlife\'s fault. Here\'s Minnie eating her egg at the moment opposite and at\r\nt\'other end of the line--are we past Lewes?--there must be Jimmy--or\r\nwhat\'s her twitch for?\r\n\r\nThere must be Moggridge--life\'s fault. Life imposes her laws; life\r\nblocks the way; life\'s behind the fern; life\'s the tyrant; oh, but not\r\nthe bully! No, for I assure you I come willingly; I come wooed by Heaven\r\nknows what compulsion across ferns and cruets, table splashed and\r\nbottles smeared. I come irresistibly to lodge myself somewhere on the\r\nfirm flesh, in the robust spine, wherever I can penetrate or find\r\nfoothold on the person, in the soul, of Moggridge the man. The enormous\r\nstability of the fabric; the spine tough as whalebone, straight as\r\noak-tree; the ribs radiating branches; the flesh taut tarpaulin; the red\r\nhollows; the suck and regurgitation of the heart; while from above meat\r\nfalls in brown cubes and beer gushes to be churned to blood again--and\r\nso we reach the eyes. Behind the aspidistra they see something: black,\r\nwhite, dismal; now the plate again; behind the aspidistra they see\r\nelderly woman; "Marsh\'s sister, Hilda\'s more my sort;" the tablecloth\r\nnow. "Marsh would know what\'s wrong with Morrises ..." talk that over;\r\ncheese has come; the plate again; turn it round--the enormous fingers;\r\nnow the woman opposite. "Marsh\'s sister--not a bit like Marsh; wretched,\r\nelderly female.... You should feed your hens.... God\'s truth, what\'s\r\nset her twitching? Not what _I_ said? Dear, dear, dear! these elderly\r\nwomen. Dear, dear!"\r\n\r\n[Yes, Minnie; I know you\'ve twitched, but one moment--James Moggridge].\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, dear!" How beautiful the sound is! like the knock of a\r\nmallet on seasoned timber, like the throb of the heart of an ancient\r\nwhaler when the seas press thick and the green is clouded. "Dear, dear!"\r\nwhat a passing bell for the souls of the fretful to soothe them and\r\nsolace them, lap them in linen, saying, "So long. Good luck to you!" and\r\nthen, "What\'s your pleasure?" for though Moggridge would pluck his rose\r\nfor her, that\'s done, that\'s over. Now what\'s the next thing? "Madam,\r\nyou\'ll miss your train," for they don\'t linger.\r\n\r\nThat\'s the man\'s way; that\'s the sound that reverberates; that\'s St.\r\nPaul\'s and the motor-omnibuses. But we\'re brushing the crumbs off. Oh,\r\nMoggridge, you won\'t stay? You must be off? Are you driving through\r\nEastbourne this afternoon in one of those little carriages? Are you the\r\nman who\'s walled up in green cardboard boxes, and sometimes has the\r\nblinds down, and sometimes sits so solemn staring like a sphinx, and\r\nalways there\'s a look of the sepulchral, something of the undertaker,\r\nthe coffin, and the dusk about horse and driver? Do tell me--but the\r\ndoors slammed. We shall never meet again. Moggridge, farewell!\r\n\r\nYes, yes, I\'m coming. Right up to the top of the house. One moment I\'ll\r\nlinger. How the mud goes round in the mind--what a swirl these monsters\r\nleave, the waters rocking, the weeds waving and green here, black there,\r\nstriking to the sand, till by degrees the atoms reassemble, the deposit\r\nsifts itself, and again through the eyes one sees clear and still, and\r\nthere comes to the lips some prayer for the departed, some obsequy for\r\nthe souls of those one nods to, the people one never meets again.\r\n\r\nJames Moggridge is dead now, gone for ever. Well, Minnie--"I can face it\r\nno longer." If she said that--(Let me look at her. She is brushing the\r\neggshell into deep declivities). She said it certainly, leaning against\r\nthe wall of the bedroom, and plucking at the little balls which edge the\r\nclaret-coloured curtain. But when the self speaks to the self, who is\r\nspeaking?--the entombed soul, the spirit driven in, in, in to the\r\ncentral catacomb; the self that took the veil and left the world--a\r\ncoward perhaps, yet somehow beautiful, as it flits with its lantern\r\nrestlessly up and down the dark corridors. "I can bear it no longer,"\r\nher spirit says. "That man at lunch--Hilda--the children." Oh, heavens,\r\nher sob! It\'s the spirit wailing its destiny, the spirit driven hither,\r\nthither, lodging on the diminishing carpets--meagre footholds--shrunken\r\nshreds of all the vanishing universe--love, life, faith, husband,\r\nchildren, I know not what splendours and pageantries glimpsed in\r\ngirlhood. "Not for me--not for me."\r\n\r\nBut then--the muffins, the bald elderly dog? Bead mats I should fancy\r\nand the consolation of underlinen. If Minnie Marsh were run over and\r\ntaken to hospital, nurses and doctors themselves would exclaim....\r\nThere\'s the vista and the vision--there\'s the distance--the blue blot at\r\nthe end of the avenue, while, after all, the tea is rich, the muffin\r\nhot, and the dog--"Benny, to your basket, sir, and see what mother\'s\r\nbrought you!" So, taking the glove with the worn thumb, defying once\r\nmore the encroaching demon of what\'s called going in holes, you renew\r\nthe fortifications, threading the grey wool, running it in and out.\r\n\r\nRunning it in and out, across and over, spinning a web through which God\r\nhimself--hush, don\'t think of God! How firm the stitches are! You must\r\nbe proud of your darning. Let nothing disturb her. Let the light fall\r\ngently, and the clouds show an inner vest of the first green leaf. Let\r\nthe sparrow perch on the twig and shake the raindrop hanging to the\r\ntwig\'s elbow.... Why look up? Was it a sound, a thought? Oh, heavens!\r\nBack again to the thing you did, the plate glass with the violet loops?\r\nBut Hilda will come. Ignominies, humiliations, oh! Close the breach.\r\n\r\nHaving mended her glove, Minnie Marsh lays it in the drawer. She shuts\r\nthe drawer with decision. I catch sight of her face in the glass. Lips\r\nare pursed. Chin held high. Next she laces her shoes. Then she touches\r\nher throat. What\'s your brooch? Mistletoe or merry-thought? And what is\r\nhappening? Unless I\'m much mistaken, the pulse\'s quickened, the moment\'s\r\ncoming, the threads are racing, Niagara\'s ahead. Here\'s the crisis!\r\nHeaven be with you! Down she goes. Courage, courage! Face it, be it! For\r\nGod\'s sake don\'t wait on the mat now! There\'s the door! I\'m on your\r\nside. Speak! Confront her, confound her soul!\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg your pardon! Yes, this is Eastbourne. I\'ll reach it down for\r\nyou. Let me try the handle." [But, Minnie, though we keep up pretences,\r\nI\'ve read you right--I\'m with you now].\r\n\r\n"That\'s all your luggage?"\r\n\r\n"Much obliged, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n(But why do you look about you? Hilda won\'t come to the station, nor\r\nJohn; and Moggridge is driving at the far side of Eastbourne).\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wait by my bag, ma\'am, that\'s safest. He said he\'d meet me.... Oh,\r\nthere he is! That\'s my son."\r\n\r\nSo they walk off together.\r\n\r\nWell, but I\'m confounded.... Surely, Minnie, you know better! A strange\r\nyoung man.... Stop! I\'ll tell him--Minnie!--Miss Marsh!--I don\'t know\r\nthough. There\'s something queer in her cloak as it blows. Oh, but it\'s\r\nuntrue, it\'s indecent.... Look how he bends as they reach the gateway.\r\nShe finds her ticket. What\'s the joke? Off they go, down the road, side\r\nby side.... Well, my world\'s done for! What do I stand on? What do I\r\nknow? That\'s not Minnie. There never was Moggridge. Who am I? Life\'s\r\nbare as bone.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the last look of them--he stepping from the kerb and she\r\nfollowing him round the edge of the big building brims me with\r\nwonder--floods me anew. Mysterious figures! Mother and son. Who are you?\r\nWhy do you walk down the street? Where to-night will you sleep, and\r\nthen, to-morrow? Oh, how it whirls and surges--floats me afresh! I start\r\nafter them. People drive this way and that. The white light splutters\r\nand pours. Plate-glass windows. Carnations; chrysanthemums. Ivy in dark\r\ngardens. Milk carts at the door. Wherever I go, mysterious figures, I\r\nsee you, turning the corner, mothers and sons; you, you, you. I hasten,\r\nI follow. This, I fancy, must be the sea. Grey is the landscape; dim as\r\nashes; the water murmurs and moves. If I fall on my knees, if I go\r\nthrough the ritual, the ancient antics, it\'s you, unknown figures, you I\r\nadore; if I open my arms, it\'s you I embrace, you I draw to me--adorable\r\nworld!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRING QUARTET\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, here we are, and if you cast your eye over the room you will see\r\nthat Tubes and trams and omnibuses, private carriages not a few, even, I\r\nventure to believe, landaus with bays in them, have been busy at it,\r\nweaving threads from one end of London to the other. Yet I begin to have\r\nmy doubts--\r\n\r\nIf indeed it\'s true, as they\'re saying, that Regent Street is up, and\r\nthe Treaty signed, and the weather not cold for the time of year, and\r\neven at that rent not a flat to be had, and the worst of influenza its\r\nafter effects; if I bethink me of having forgotten to write about the\r\nleak in the larder, and left my glove in the train; if the ties of blood\r\nrequire me, leaning forward, to accept cordially the hand which is\r\nperhaps offered hesitatingly--\r\n\r\n"Seven years since we met!"\r\n\r\n"The last time in Venice."\r\n\r\n"And where are you living now?"\r\n\r\n"Well, the late afternoon suits me the best, though, if it weren\'t\r\nasking too much----"\r\n\r\n"But I knew you at once!"\r\n\r\n"Still, the war made a break----"\r\n\r\nIf the mind\'s shot through by such little arrows, and--for human society\r\ncompels it--no sooner is one launched than another presses forward; if\r\nthis engenders heat and in addition they\'ve turned on the electric\r\nlight; if saying one thing does, in so many cases, leave behind it a\r\nneed to improve and revise, stirring besides regrets, pleasures,\r\nvanities, and desires--if it\'s all the facts I mean, and the hats, the\r\nfur boas, the gentlemen\'s swallow-tail coats, and pearl tie-pins that\r\ncome to the surface--what chance is there?\r\n\r\nOf what? It becomes every minute more difficult to say why, in spite of\r\neverything, I sit here believing I can\'t now say what, or even remember\r\nthe last time it happened.\r\n\r\n"Did you see the procession?"\r\n\r\n"The King looked cold."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no. But what was it?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s bought a house at Malmesbury."\r\n\r\n"How lucky to find one!"\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it seems to me pretty sure that she, whoever she may\r\nbe, is damned, since it\'s all a matter of flats and hats and sea gulls,\r\nor so it seems to be for a hundred people sitting here well dressed,\r\nwalled in, furred, replete. Not that I can boast, since I too sit\r\npassive on a gilt chair, only turning the earth above a buried memory,\r\nas we all do, for there are signs, if I\'m not mistaken, that we\'re all\r\nrecalling something, furtively seeking something. Why fidget? Why so\r\nanxious about the sit of cloaks; and gloves--whether to button or\r\nunbutton? Then watch that elderly face against the dark canvas, a moment\r\nago urbane and flushed; now taciturn and sad, as if in shadow. Was it\r\nthe sound of the second violin tuning in the ante-room? Here they come;\r\nfour black figures, carrying instruments, and seat themselves facing\r\nthe white squares under the downpour of light; rest the tips of their\r\nbows on the music stand; with a simultaneous movement lift them; lightly\r\npoise them, and, looking across at the player opposite, the first violin\r\ncounts one, two, three----\r\n\r\nFlourish, spring, burgeon, burst! The pear tree on the top of the\r\nmountain. Fountains jet; drops descend. But the waters of the Rhone flow\r\nswift and deep, race under the arches, and sweep the trailing water\r\nleaves, washing shadows over the silver fish, the spotted fish rushed\r\ndown by the swift waters, now swept into an eddy where--it\'s difficult\r\nthis--conglomeration of fish all in a pool; leaping, splashing, scraping\r\nsharp fins; and such a boil of current that the yellow pebbles are\r\nchurned round and round, round and round--free now, rushing downwards,\r\nor even somehow ascending in exquisite spirals into the air; curled like\r\nthin shavings from under a plane; up and up.... How lovely goodness is\r\nin those who, stepping lightly, go smiling through the world! Also in\r\njolly old fishwives, squatted under arches, obscene old women, how\r\ndeeply they laugh and shake and rollick, when they walk, from side to\r\nside, hum, hah!\r\n\r\n"That\'s an early Mozart, of course----"\r\n\r\n"But the tune, like all his tunes, makes one despair--I mean hope. What\r\ndo I mean? That\'s the worst of music! I want to dance, laugh, eat pink\r\ncakes, yellow cakes, drink thin, sharp wine. Or an indecent story,\r\nnow--I could relish that. The older one grows the more one likes\r\nindecency. Hah, hah! I\'m laughing. What at? You said nothing, nor did\r\nthe old gentleman opposite.... But suppose--suppose--Hush!"\r\n\r\nThe melancholy river bears us on. When the moon comes through the\r\ntrailing willow boughs, I see your face, I hear your voice and the bird\r\nsinging as we pass the osier bed. What are you whispering? Sorrow,\r\nsorrow. Joy, joy. Woven together, like reeds in moonlight. Woven\r\ntogether, inextricably commingled, bound in pain and strewn in\r\nsorrow--crash!\r\n\r\nThe boat sinks. Rising, the figures ascend, but now leaf thin, tapering\r\nto a dusky wraith, which, fiery tipped, draws its twofold passion from\r\nmy heart. For me it sings, unseals my sorrow, thaws compassion, floods\r\nwith love the sunless world, nor, ceasing, abates its tenderness but\r\ndeftly, subtly, weaves in and out until in this pattern, this\r\nconsummation, the cleft ones unify; soar, sob, sink to rest, sorrow and\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nWhy then grieve? Ask what? Remain unsatisfied? I say all\'s been settled;\r\nyes; laid to rest under a coverlet of rose leaves, falling. Falling. Ah,\r\nbut they cease. One rose leaf, falling from an enormous height, like a\r\nlittle parachute dropped from an invisible balloon, turns, flutters\r\nwaveringly. It won\'t reach us.\r\n\r\n"No, no. I noticed nothing. That\'s the worst of music--these silly\r\ndreams. The second violin was late, you say?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s old Mrs. Munro, feeling her way out--blinder each year, poor\r\nwoman--on this slippery floor."\r\n\r\nEyeless old age, grey-headed Sphinx.... There she stands on the\r\npavement, beckoning, so sternly, the red omnibus.\r\n\r\n"How lovely! How well they play! How--how--how!"\r\n\r\nThe tongue is but a clapper. Simplicity itself. The feathers in the hat\r\nnext me are bright and pleasing as a child\'s rattle. The leaf on the\r\nplane-tree flashes green through the chink in the curtain. Very strange,\r\nvery exciting.\r\n\r\n"How--how--how!" Hush!\r\n\r\nThese are the lovers on the grass.\r\n\r\n"If, madam, you will take my hand----"\r\n\r\n"Sir, I would trust you with my heart. Moreover, we have left our bodies\r\nin the banqueting hall. Those on the turf are the shadows of our souls."\r\n\r\n"Then these are the embraces of our souls." The lemons nod assent. The\r\nswan pushes from the bank and floats dreaming into mid stream.\r\n\r\n"But to return. He followed me down the corridor, and, as we turned the\r\ncorner, trod on the lace of my petticoat. What could I do but cry \'Ah!\'\r\nand stop to finger it? At which he drew his sword, made passes as if he\r\nwere stabbing something to death, and cried, \'Mad! Mad! Mad!\' Whereupon\r\nI screamed, and the Prince, who was writing in the large vellum book in\r\nthe oriel window, came out in his velvet skull-cap and furred slippers,\r\nsnatched a rapier from the wall--the King of Spain\'s gift, you know--on\r\nwhich I escaped, flinging on this cloak to hide the ravages to my\r\nskirt--to hide.... But listen! the horns!"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman replies so fast to the lady, and she runs up the scale\r\nwith such witty exchange of compliment now culminating in a sob of\r\npassion, that the words are indistinguishable though the meaning is\r\nplain enough--love, laughter, flight, pursuit, celestial bliss--all\r\nfloated out on the gayest ripple of tender endearment--until the sound\r\nof the silver horns, at first far distant, gradually sounds more and\r\nmore distinctly, as if seneschals were saluting the dawn or proclaiming\r\nominously the escape of the lovers.... The green garden, moonlit pool,\r\nlemons, lovers, and fish are all dissolved in the opal sky, across\r\nwhich, as the horns are joined by trumpets and supported by clarions\r\nthere rise white arches firmly planted on marble pillars.... Tramp and\r\ntrumpeting. Clang and clangour. Firm establishment. Fast foundations.\r\nMarch of myriads. Confusion and chaos trod to earth. But this city to\r\nwhich we travel has neither stone nor marble; hangs enduring; stands\r\nunshakable; nor does a face, nor does a flag greet or welcome. Leave\r\nthen to perish your hope; droop in the desert my joy; naked advance.\r\nBare are the pillars; auspicious to none; casting no shade; resplendent;\r\nsevere. Back then I fall, eager no more, desiring only to go, find the\r\nstreet, mark the buildings, greet the applewoman, say to the maid who\r\nopens the door: A starry night.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good night, good night. You go this way?"\r\n\r\n"Alas. I go that."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE & GREEN\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN\r\n\r\nThe pointed fingers of glass hang downwards. The light slides down the\r\nglass, and drops a pool of green. All day long the ten fingers of the\r\nlustre drop green upon the marble. The feathers of parakeets--their\r\nharsh cries--sharp blades of palm trees--green, too; green needles\r\nglittering in the sun. But the hard glass drips on to the marble; the\r\npools hover above the dessert sand; the camels lurch through them; the\r\npools settle on the marble; rushes edge them; weeds clog them; here and\r\nthere a white blossom; the frog flops over; at night the stars are set\r\nthere unbroken. Evening comes, and the shadow sweeps the green over the\r\nmantelpiece; the ruffled surface of ocean. No ships come; the aimless\r\nwaves sway beneath the empty sky. It\'s night; the needles drip blots of\r\nblue. The green\'s out.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE\r\n\r\nThe snub-nosed monster rises to the surface and spouts through his blunt\r\nnostrils two columns of water, which, fiery-white in the centre, spray\r\noff into a fringe of blue beads. Strokes of blue line the black\r\ntarpaulin of his hide. Slushing the water through mouth and nostrils he\r\nsings, heavy with water, and the blue closes over him dowsing the\r\npolished pebbles of his eyes. Thrown upon the beach he lies, blunt,\r\nobtuse, shedding dry blue scales. Their metallic blue stains the rusty\r\niron on the beach. Blue are the ribs of the wrecked rowing boat. A wave\r\nrolls beneath the blue bells. But the cathedral\'s different, cold,\r\nincense laden, faint blue with the veils of madonnas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEW GARDENS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the oval-shaped flower-bed there rose perhaps a hundred stalks\r\nspreading into heart-shaped or tongue-shaped leaves half way up and\r\nunfurling at the tip red or blue or yellow petals marked with spots of\r\ncolour raised upon the surface; and from the red, blue or yellow gloom\r\nof the throat emerged a straight bar, rough with gold dust and slightly\r\nclubbed at the end. The petals were voluminous enough to be stirred by\r\nthe summer breeze, and when they moved, the red, blue and yellow lights\r\npassed one over the other, staining an inch of the brown earth beneath\r\nwith a spot of the most intricate colour. The light fell either upon the\r\nsmooth, grey back of a pebble, or, the shell of a snail with its brown,\r\ncircular veins, or falling into a raindrop, it expanded with such\r\nintensity of red, blue and yellow the thin walls of water that one\r\nexpected them to burst and disappear. Instead, the drop was left in a\r\nsecond silver grey once more, and the light now settled upon the flesh\r\nof a leaf, revealing the branching thread of fibre beneath the surface,\r\nand again it moved on and spread its illumination in the vast green\r\nspaces beneath the dome of the heart-shaped and tongue-shaped leaves.\r\nThen the breeze stirred rather more briskly overhead and the colour was\r\nflashed into the air above, into the eyes of the men and women who walk\r\nin Kew Gardens in July.\r\n\r\nThe figures of these men and women straggled past the flower-bed with a\r\ncuriously irregular movement not unlike that of the white and blue\r\nbutterflies who crossed the turf in zig-zag flights from bed to bed. The\r\nman was about six inches in front of the woman, strolling carelessly,\r\nwhile she bore on with greater purpose, only turning her head now and\r\nthen to see that the children were not too far behind. The man kept this\r\ndistance in front of the woman purposely, though perhaps unconsciously,\r\nfor he wished to go on with his thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen years ago I came here with Lily," he thought. "We sat somewhere\r\nover there by a lake and I begged her to marry me all through the hot\r\nafternoon. How the dragonfly kept circling round us: how clearly I see\r\nthe dragonfly and her shoe with the square silver buckle at the toe. All\r\nthe time I spoke I saw her shoe and when it moved impatiently I knew\r\nwithout looking up what she was going to say: the whole of her seemed to\r\nbe in her shoe. And my love, my desire, were in the dragonfly; for some\r\nreason I thought that if it settled there, on that leaf, the broad one\r\nwith the red flower in the middle of it, if the dragonfly settled on the\r\nleaf she would say "Yes" at once. But the dragonfly went round and\r\nround: it never settled anywhere--of course not, happily not, or I\r\nshouldn\'t be walking here with Eleanor and the children--Tell me,\r\nEleanor. D\'you ever think of the past?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask, Simon?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'ve been thinking of the past. I\'ve been thinking of Lily,\r\nthe woman I might have married.... Well, why are you silent? Do you mind\r\nmy thinking of the past?"\r\n\r\n"Why should I mind, Simon? Doesn\'t one always think of the past, in a\r\ngarden with men and women lying under the trees? Aren\'t they one\'s past,\r\nall that remains of it, those men and women, those ghosts lying under\r\nthe trees, ... one\'s happiness, one\'s reality?"\r\n\r\n"For me, a square silver shoe buckle and a dragonfly--"\r\n\r\n"For me, a kiss. Imagine six little girls sitting before their easels\r\ntwenty years ago, down by the side of a lake, painting the water-lilies,\r\nthe first red water-lilies I\'d ever seen. And suddenly a kiss, there on\r\nthe back of my neck. And my hand shook all the afternoon so that I\r\ncouldn\'t paint. I took out my watch and marked the hour when I would\r\nallow myself to think of the kiss for five minutes only--it was so\r\nprecious--the kiss of an old grey-haired woman with a wart on her nose,\r\nthe mother of all my kisses all my life. Come, Caroline, come, Hubert."\r\n\r\nThey walked on past the flower-bed, now walking four abreast, and\r\nsoon diminished in size among the trees and looked half transparent as\r\nthe sunlight and shade swam over their backs in large trembling\r\nirregular patches.\r\n\r\nIn the oval flower bed the snail, whose shell had been stained red,\r\nblue, and yellow for the space of two minutes or so, now appeared to be\r\nmoving very slightly in its shell, and next began to labour over the\r\ncrumbs of loose earth which broke away and rolled down as it passed over\r\nthem. It appeared to have a definite goal in front of it, differing in\r\nthis respect from the singular high stepping angular green insect who\r\nattempted to cross in front of it, and waited for a second with its\r\nantennae trembling as if in deliberation, and then stepped off as rapidly\r\nand strangely in the opposite direction. Brown cliffs with deep green\r\nlakes in the hollows, flat, blade-like trees that waved from root to\r\ntip, round boulders of grey stone, vast crumpled surfaces of a thin\r\ncrackling texture--all these objects lay across the snail\'s progress\r\nbetween one stalk and another to his goal. Before he had decided whether\r\nto circumvent the arched tent of a dead leaf or to breast it there came\r\npast the bed the feet of other human beings.\r\n\r\nThis time they were both men. The younger of the two wore an expression\r\nof perhaps unnatural calm; he raised his eyes and fixed them very\r\nsteadily in front of him while his companion spoke, and directly his\r\ncompanion had done speaking he looked on the ground again and sometimes\r\nopened his lips only after a long pause and sometimes did not open them\r\nat all. The elder man had a curiously uneven and shaky method of\r\nwalking, jerking his hand forward and throwing up his head abruptly,\r\nrather in the manner of an impatient carriage horse tired of waiting\r\noutside a house; but in the man these gestures were irresolute and\r\npointless. He talked almost incessantly; he smiled to himself and again\r\nbegan to talk, as if the smile had been an answer. He was talking about\r\nspirits--the spirits of the dead, who, according to him, were even now\r\ntelling him all sorts of odd things about their experiences in Heaven.\r\n\r\n"Heaven was known to the ancients as Thessaly, William, and now, with\r\nthis war, the spirit matter is rolling between the hills like thunder."\r\nHe paused, seemed to listen, smiled, jerked his head and continued:--\r\n\r\n"You have a small electric battery and a piece of rubber to insulate the\r\nwire--isolate?--insulate?--well, we\'ll skip the details, no good going\r\ninto details that wouldn\'t be understood--and in short the little\r\nmachine stands in any convenient position by the head of the bed, we\r\nwill say, on a neat mahogany stand. All arrangements being properly\r\nfixed by workmen under my direction, the widow applies her ear and\r\nsummons the spirit by sign as agreed. Women! Widows! Women in black----"\r\n\r\nHere he seemed to have caught sight of a woman\'s dress in the distance,\r\nwhich in the shade looked a purple black. He took off his hat, placed\r\nhis hand upon his heart, and hurried towards her muttering and\r\ngesticulating feverishly. But William caught him by the sleeve and\r\ntouched a flower with the tip of his walking-stick in order to divert\r\nthe old man\'s attention. After looking at it for a moment in some\r\nconfusion the old man bent his ear to it and seemed to answer a voice\r\nspeaking from it, for he began talking about the forests of Uruguay\r\nwhich he had visited hundreds of years ago in company with the most\r\nbeautiful young woman in Europe. He could be heard murmuring about\r\nforests of Uruguay blanketed with the wax petals of tropical roses,\r\nnightingales, sea beaches, mermaids, and women drowned at sea, as he\r\nsuffered himself to be moved on by William, upon whose face the look of\r\nstoical patience grew slowly deeper and deeper.\r\n\r\nFollowing his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled by his\r\ngestures came two elderly women of the lower middle class, one stout and\r\nponderous, the other rosy cheeked and nimble. Like most people of their\r\nstation they were frankly fascinated by any signs of eccentricity\r\nbetokening a disordered brain, especially in the well-to-do; but they\r\nwere too far off to be certain whether the gestures were merely\r\neccentric or genuinely mad. After they had scrutinised the old man\'s\r\nback in silence for a moment and given each other a queer, sly look,\r\nthey went on energetically piecing together their very complicated\r\ndialogue:\r\n\r\n"Nell, Bert, Lot, Cess, Phil, Pa, he says, I says, she says, I says, I\r\nsays, I says----"\r\n\r\n"My Bert, Sis, Bill, Grandad, the old man, sugar,\r\n\r\n\r\n     Sugar, flour, kippers, greens,\r\n     Sugar, sugar, sugar."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ponderous woman looked through the pattern of falling words at the\r\nflowers standing cool, firm, and upright in the earth, with a curious\r\nexpression. She saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a\r\nbrass candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and closes\r\nhis eyes and opens them, and seeing the brass candlestick again, finally\r\nstarts broad awake and stares at the candlestick with all his powers. So\r\nthe heavy woman came to a standstill opposite the oval-shaped flower\r\nbed, and ceased even to pretend to listen to what the other woman was\r\nsaying. She stood there letting the words fall over her, swaying the top\r\npart of her body slowly backwards and forwards, looking at the flowers.\r\nThen she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea.\r\n\r\nThe snail had now considered every possible method of reaching his goal\r\nwithout going round the dead leaf or climbing over it. Let alone the\r\neffort needed for climbing a leaf, he was doubtful whether the thin\r\ntexture which vibrated with such an alarming crackle when touched even\r\nby the tip of his horns would bear his weight; and this determined him\r\nfinally to creep beneath it, for there was a point where the leaf curved\r\nhigh enough from the ground to admit him. He had just inserted his head\r\nin the opening and was taking stock of the high brown roof and was\r\ngetting used to the cool brown light when two other people came past\r\noutside on the turf. This time they were both young, a young man and a\r\nyoung woman. They were both in the prime of youth, or even in that\r\nseason which precedes the prime of youth, the season before the smooth\r\npink folds of the flower have burst their gummy case, when the wings of\r\nthe butterfly, though fully grown, are motionless in the sun.\r\n\r\n"Lucky it isn\'t Friday," he observed.\r\n\r\n"Why? D\'you believe in luck?"\r\n\r\n"They make you pay sixpence on Friday."\r\n\r\n"What\'s sixpence anyway? Isn\'t it worth sixpence?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s \'it\'--what do you mean by \'it\'?"\r\n\r\n"O, anything--I mean--you know what I mean."\r\n\r\nLong pauses came between each of these remarks; they were uttered in\r\ntoneless and monotonous voices. The couple stood still on the edge of\r\nthe flower bed, and together pressed the end of her parasol deep down\r\ninto the soft earth. The action and the fact that his hand rested on the\r\ntop of hers expressed their feelings in a strange way, as these short\r\ninsignificant words also expressed something, words with short wings for\r\ntheir heavy body of meaning, inadequate to carry them far and thus\r\nalighting awkwardly upon the very common objects that surrounded them,\r\nand were to their inexperienced touch so massive; but who knows (so they\r\nthought as they pressed the parasol into the earth) what precipices\r\naren\'t concealed in them, or what slopes of ice don\'t shine in the sun\r\non the other side? Who knows? Who has ever seen this before? Even when\r\nshe wondered what sort of tea they gave you at Kew, he felt that\r\nsomething loomed up behind her words, and stood vast and solid behind\r\nthem; and the mist very slowly rose and uncovered--O, Heavens, what were\r\nthose shapes?--little white tables, and waitresses who looked first at\r\nher and then at him; and there was a bill that he would pay with a real\r\ntwo shilling piece, and it was real, all real, he assured himself,\r\nfingering the coin in his pocket, real to everyone except to him and to\r\nher; even to him it began to seem real; and then--but it was too\r\nexciting to stand and think any longer, and he pulled the parasol out of\r\nthe earth with a jerk and was impatient to find the place where one had\r\ntea with other people, like other people.\r\n\r\n"Come along, Trissie; it\'s time we had our tea."\r\n\r\n"Wherever _does_ one have one\'s tea?" she asked with the oddest thrill\r\nof excitement in her voice, looking vaguely round and letting herself be\r\ndrawn on down the grass path, trailing her parasol, turning her head\r\nthis way and that way, forgetting her tea, wishing to go down there and\r\nthen down there, remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers, a\r\nChinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird; but he bore her on.\r\n\r\nThus one couple after another with much the same irregular and aimless\r\nmovement passed the flower-bed and were enveloped in layer after layer\r\nof green blue vapour, in which at first their bodies had substance and a\r\ndash of colour, but later both substance and colour dissolved in the\r\ngreen-blue atmosphere. How hot it was! So hot that even the thrush chose\r\nto hop, like a mechanical bird, in the shadow of the flowers, with long\r\npauses between one movement and the next; instead of rambling vaguely\r\nthe white butterflies danced one above another, making with their white\r\nshifting flakes the outline of a shattered marble column above the\r\ntallest flowers; the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole\r\nmarket full of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun; and in the\r\ndrone of the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce\r\nsoul. Yellow and black, pink and snow white, shapes of all these\r\ncolours, men, women, and children were spotted for a second upon the\r\nhorizon, and then, seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the grass,\r\nthey wavered and sought shade beneath the trees, dissolving like drops\r\nof water in the yellow and green atmosphere, staining it faintly with\r\nred and blue. It seemed as if all gross and heavy bodies had sunk down\r\nin the heat motionless and lay huddled upon the ground, but their voices\r\nwent wavering from them as if they were flames lolling from the thick\r\nwaxen bodies of candles. Voices. Yes, voices. Wordless voices, breaking\r\nthe silence suddenly with such depth of contentment, such passion of\r\ndesire, or, in the voices of children, such freshness of surprise;\r\nbreaking the silence? But there was no silence; all the time the motor\r\nomnibuses were turning their wheels and changing their gear; like a vast\r\nnest of Chinese boxes all of wrought steel turning ceaselessly one\r\nwithin another the city murmured; on the top of which the voices cried\r\naloud and the petals of myriads of flowers flashed their colours into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARK ON THE WALL\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the middle of January in the present year that I first\r\nlooked up and saw the mark on the wall. In order to fix a date it is\r\nnecessary to remember what one saw. So now I think of the fire; the\r\nsteady film of yellow light upon the page of my book; the three\r\nchrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. Yes, it must\r\nhave been the winter time, and we had just finished our tea, for I\r\nremember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and saw the\r\nmark on the wall for the first time. I looked up through the smoke of my\r\ncigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the burning coals, and\r\nthat old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower came\r\ninto my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding up\r\nthe side of the black rock. Rather to my relief the sight of the mark\r\ninterrupted the fancy, for it is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made\r\nas a child perhaps. The mark was a small round mark, black upon the\r\nwhite wall, about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nHow readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object, lifting it a little\r\nway, as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly, and then leave it....\r\nIf that mark was made by a nail, it can\'t have been for a picture, it\r\nmust have been for a miniature--the miniature of a lady with white\r\npowdered curls, powder-dusted cheeks, and lips like red carnations. A\r\nfraud of course, for the people who had this house before us would have\r\nchosen pictures in that way--an old picture for an old room. That is the\r\nsort of people they were--very interesting people, and I think of them\r\nso often, in such queer places, because one will never see them again,\r\nnever know what happened next. They wanted to leave this house because\r\nthey wanted to change their style of furniture, so he said, and he was\r\nin process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind it\r\nwhen we were torn asunder, as one is torn from the old lady about to\r\npour out tea and the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back\r\ngarden of the suburban villa as one rushes past in the train.\r\n\r\nBut as for that mark, I\'m not sure about it; I don\'t believe it was made\r\nby a nail after all; it\'s too big, too round, for that. I might get up,\r\nbut if I got up and looked at it, ten to one I shouldn\'t be able to say\r\nfor certain; because once a thing\'s done, no one ever knows how it\r\nhappened. Oh! dear me, the mystery of life; The inaccuracy of thought!\r\nThe ignorance of humanity! To show how very little control of our\r\npossessions we have--what an accidental affair this living is after all\r\nour civilization--let me just count over a few of the things lost in one\r\nlifetime, beginning, for that seems always the most mysterious of\r\nlosses--what cat would gnaw, what rat would nibble--three pale blue\r\ncanisters of book-binding tools? Then there were the bird cages, the\r\niron hoops, the steel skates, the Queen Anne coal-scuttle, the bagatelle\r\nboard, the hand organ--all gone, and jewels, too. Opals and emeralds,\r\nthey lie about the roots of turnips. What a scraping paring affair it is\r\nto be sure! The wonder is that I\'ve any clothes on my back, that I sit\r\nsurrounded by solid furniture at this moment. Why, if one wants to\r\ncompare life to anything, one must liken it to being blown through the\r\nTube at fifty miles an hour--landing at the other end without a single\r\nhairpin in one\'s hair! Shot out at the feet of God entirely naked!\r\nTumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper\r\nparcels pitched down a shoot in the post office! With one\'s hair flying\r\nback like the tail of a race-horse. Yes, that seems to express the\r\nrapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, all so\r\nhaphazard....\r\n\r\nBut after life. The slow pulling down of thick green stalks so that the\r\ncup of the flower, as it turns over, deluges one with purple and red\r\nlight. Why, after all, should one not be born there as one is born here,\r\nhelpless, speechless, unable to focus one\'s eyesight, groping at the\r\nroots of the grass, at the toes of the Giants? As for saying which are\r\ntrees, and which are men and women, or whether there are such things,\r\nthat one won\'t be in a condition to do for fifty years or so. There will\r\nbe nothing but spaces of light and dark, intersected by thick stalks,\r\nand rather higher up perhaps, rose-shaped blots of an indistinct\r\ncolour--dim pinks and blues--which will, as time goes on, become more\r\ndefinite, become--I don\'t know what....\r\n\r\nAnd yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all. It may even be\r\ncaused by some round black substance, such as a small rose leaf, left\r\nover from the summer, and I, not being a very vigilant housekeeper--look\r\nat the dust on the mantelpiece, for example, the dust which, so they\r\nsay, buried Troy three times over, only fragments of pots utterly\r\nrefusing annihilation, as one can believe.\r\n\r\nThe tree outside the window taps very gently on the pane.... I want to\r\nthink quietly, calmly, spaciously, never to be interrupted, never to\r\nhave to rise from my chair, to slip easily from one thing to another,\r\nwithout any sense of hostility, or obstacle. I want to sink deeper and\r\ndeeper, away from the surface, with its hard separate facts. To steady\r\nmyself, let me catch hold of the first idea that passes....\r\nShakespeare.... Well, he will do as well as another. A man who sat\r\nhimself solidly in an arm-chair, and looked into the fire, so--A shower\r\nof ideas fell perpetually from some very high Heaven down through his\r\nmind. He leant his forehead on his hand, and people, looking in through\r\nthe open door,--for this scene is supposed to take place on a summer\'s\r\nevening--But how dull this is, this historical fiction! It doesn\'t\r\ninterest me at all. I wish I could hit upon a pleasant track of thought,\r\na track indirectly reflecting credit upon myself, for those are the\r\npleasantest thoughts, and very frequent even in the minds of modest\r\nmouse-coloured people, who believe genuinely that they dislike to hear\r\ntheir own praises. They are not thoughts directly praising oneself; that\r\nis the beauty of them; they are thoughts like this:\r\n\r\n"And then I came into the room. They were discussing botany. I said how\r\nI\'d seen a flower growing on a dust heap on the site of an old house in\r\nKingsway. The seed, I said, must have been sown in the reign of Charles\r\nthe First. What flowers grew in the reign of Charles the First?" I\r\nasked--(but I don\'t remember the answer). Tall flowers with purple\r\ntassels to them perhaps. And so it goes on. All the time I\'m dressing up\r\nthe figure of myself in my own mind, lovingly, stealthily, not openly\r\nadoring it, for if I did that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my\r\nhand at once for a book in self-protection. Indeed, it is curious how\r\ninstinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any\r\nother handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike the original\r\nto be believed in any longer. Or is it not so very curious after all? It\r\nis a matter of great importance. Suppose the looking glass smashes, the\r\nimage disappears, and the romantic figure with the green of forest\r\ndepths all about it is there no longer, but only that shell of a person\r\nwhich is seen by other people--what an airless, shallow, bald, prominent\r\nworld it becomes! A world not to be lived in. As we face each other in\r\nomnibuses and underground railways we are looking into the mirror; that\r\naccounts for the vagueness, the gleam of glassiness, in our eyes. And\r\nthe novelists in future will realize more and more the importance of\r\nthese reflections, for of course there is not one reflection but an\r\nalmost infinite number; those are the depths they will explore, those\r\nthe phantoms they will pursue, leaving the description of reality more\r\nand more out of their stories, taking a knowledge of it for granted, as\r\nthe Greeks did and Shakespeare perhaps--but these generalizations are\r\nvery worthless. The military sound of the word is enough. It recalls\r\nleading articles, cabinet ministers--a whole class of things indeed\r\nwhich as a child one thought the thing itself, the standard thing, the\r\nreal thing, from which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless\r\ndamnation. Generalizations bring back somehow Sunday in London, Sunday\r\nafternoon walks, Sunday luncheons, and also ways of speaking of the\r\ndead, clothes, and habits--like the habit of sitting all together in one\r\nroom until a certain hour, although nobody liked it. There was a rule\r\nfor everything. The rule for tablecloths at that particular period was\r\nthat they should be made of tapestry with little yellow compartments\r\nmarked upon them, such as you may see in photographs of the carpets in\r\nthe corridors of the royal palaces. Tablecloths of a different kind were\r\nnot real tablecloths. How shocking, and yet how wonderful it was to\r\ndiscover that these real things, Sunday luncheons, Sunday walks,\r\ncountry houses, and tablecloths were not entirely real, were indeed half\r\nphantoms, and the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was\r\nonly a sense of illegitimate freedom. What now takes the place of those\r\nthings I wonder, those real standard things? Men perhaps, should you be\r\na woman; the masculine point of view which governs our lives, which sets\r\nthe standard, which establishes Whitaker\'s Table of Precedency, which\r\nhas become, I suppose, since the war half a phantom to many men and\r\nwomen, which soon, one may hope, will be laughed into the dustbin where\r\nthe phantoms go, the mahogany sideboards and the Landseer prints, Gods\r\nand Devils, Hell and so forth, leaving us all with an intoxicating sense\r\nof illegitimate freedom--if freedom exists....\r\n\r\nIn certain lights that mark on the wall seems actually to project from\r\nthe wall. Nor is it entirely circular. I cannot be sure, but it seems to\r\ncast a perceptible shadow, suggesting that if I ran my finger down that\r\nstrip of the wall it would, at a certain point, mount and descend a\r\nsmall tumulus, a smooth tumulus like those barrows on the South Downs\r\nwhich are, they say, either tombs or camps. Of the two I should prefer\r\nthem to be tombs, desiring melancholy like most English people, and\r\nfinding it natural at the end of a walk to think of the bones stretched\r\nbeneath the turf.... There must be some book about it. Some antiquary\r\nmust have dug up those bones and given them a name.... What sort of a\r\nman is an antiquary, I wonder? Retired Colonels for the most part, I\r\ndaresay, leading parties of aged labourers to the top here, examining\r\nclods of earth and stone, and getting into correspondence with the\r\nneighbouring clergy, which, being opened at breakfast time, gives them a\r\nfeeling of importance, and the comparison of arrow-heads necessitates\r\ncross-country journeys to the county towns, an agreeable necessity both\r\nto them and to their elderly wives, who wish to make plum jam or to\r\nclean out the study, and have every reason for keeping that great\r\nquestion of the camp or the tomb in perpetual suspension, while the\r\nColonel himself feels agreeably philosophic in accumulating evidence on\r\nboth sides of the question. It is true that he does finally incline to\r\nbelieve in the camp; and, being opposed, indites a pamphlet which he is\r\nabout to read at the quarterly meeting of the local society when a\r\nstroke lays him low, and his last conscious thoughts are not of wife or\r\nchild, but of the camp and that arrowhead there, which is now in the\r\ncase at the local museum, together with the foot of a Chinese murderess,\r\na handful of Elizabethan nails, a great many Tudor clay pipes, a piece\r\nof Roman pottery, and the wine-glass that Nelson drank out of--proving I\r\nreally don\'t know what.\r\n\r\nNo, no, nothing is proved, nothing is known. And if I were to get up at\r\nthis very moment and ascertain that the mark on the wall is really--what\r\nshall we say?--the head of a gigantic old nail, driven in two hundred\r\nyears ago, which has now, owing to the patient attrition of many\r\ngenerations of housemaids, revealed its head above the coat of paint,\r\nand is taking its first view of modern life in the sight of a\r\nwhite-walled fire-lit room, what should I gain?--Knowledge? Matter for\r\nfurther speculation? I can think sitting still as well as standing up.\r\nAnd what is knowledge? What are our learned men save the descendants of\r\nwitches and hermits who crouched in caves and in woods brewing herbs,\r\ninterrogating shrew-mice and writing down the language of the stars? And\r\nthe less we honour them as our superstitions dwindle and our respect for\r\nbeauty and health of mind increases.... Yes, one could imagine a very\r\npleasant world. A quiet, spacious world, with the flowers so red and\r\nblue in the open fields. A world without professors or specialists or\r\nhouse-keepers with the profiles of policemen, a world which one could\r\nslice with one\'s thought as a fish slices the water with his fin,\r\ngrazing the stems of the water-lilies, hanging suspended over nests of\r\nwhite sea eggs.... How peaceful it is down here, rooted in the centre of\r\nthe world and gazing up through the grey waters, with their sudden\r\ngleams of light, and their reflections--if it were not for Whitaker\'s\r\nAlmanack--if it were not for the Table of Precedency!\r\n\r\nI must jump up and see for myself what that mark on the wall really\r\nis--a nail, a rose-leaf, a crack in the wood?\r\n\r\nHere is nature once more at her old game of self-preservation. This\r\ntrain of thought, she perceives, is threatening mere waste of energy,\r\neven some collision with reality, for who will ever be able to lift a\r\nfinger against Whitaker\'s Table of Precedency? The Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury is followed by the Lord High Chancellor; the Lord High\r\nChancellor is followed by the Archbishop of York. Everybody follows\r\nsomebody, such is the philosophy of Whitaker; and the great thing is to\r\nknow who follows whom. Whitaker knows, and let that, so Nature\r\ncounsels, comfort you, instead of enraging you; and if you can\'t be\r\ncomforted, if you must shatter this hour of peace, think of the mark on\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nI understand Nature\'s game--her prompting to take action as a way of\r\nending any thought that threatens to excite or to pain. Hence, I\r\nsuppose, comes our slight contempt for men of action--men, we assume,\r\nwho don\'t think. Still, there\'s no harm in putting a full stop to one\'s\r\ndisagreeable thoughts by looking at a mark on the wall.\r\n\r\nIndeed, now that I have fixed my eyes upon it, I feel that I have\r\ngrasped a plank in the sea; I feel a satisfying sense of reality which\r\nat once turns the two Archbishops and the Lord High Chancellor to the\r\nshadows of shades. Here is something definite, something real. Thus,\r\nwaking from a midnight dream of horror, one hastily turns on the light\r\nand lies quiescent, worshipping the chest of drawers, worshipping\r\nsolidity, worshipping reality, worshipping the impersonal world which is\r\na proof of some existence other than ours. That is what one wants to be\r\nsure of.... Wood is a pleasant thing to think about. It comes from a\r\ntree; and trees grow, and we don\'t know how they grow. For years and\r\nyears they grow, without paying any attention to us, in meadows, in\r\nforests, and by the side of rivers--all things one likes to think about.\r\nThe cows swish their tails beneath them on hot afternoons; they paint\r\nrivers so green that when a moorhen dives one expects to see its\r\nfeathers all green when it comes up again. I like to think of the fish\r\nbalanced against the stream like flags blown out; and of water-beetles\r\nslowly raising domes of mud upon the bed of the river. I like to think\r\nof the tree itself: first the close dry sensation of being wood; then\r\nthe grinding of the storm; then the slow, delicious ooze of sap. I like\r\nto think of it, too, on winter\'s nights standing in the empty field with\r\nall leaves close-furled, nothing tender exposed to the iron bullets of\r\nthe moon, a naked mast upon an earth that goes tumbling, tumbling, all\r\nnight long. The song of birds must sound very loud and strange in June;\r\nand how cold the feet of insects must feel upon it, as they make\r\nlaborious progresses up the creases of the bark, or sun themselves upon\r\nthe thin green awning of the leaves, and look straight in front of them\r\nwith diamond-cut red eyes.... One by one the fibres snap beneath the\r\nimmense cold pressure of the earth, then the last storm comes and,\r\nfalling, the highest branches drive deep into the ground again. Even so,\r\nlife isn\'t done with; there are a million patient, watchful lives still\r\nfor a tree, all over the world, in bedrooms, in ships, on the pavement,\r\nlining rooms, where men and women sit after tea, smoking cigarettes. It\r\nis full of peaceful thoughts, happy thoughts, this tree. I should like\r\nto take each one separately--but something is getting in the way....\r\nWhere was I? What has it all been about? A tree? A river? The Downs?\r\nWhitaker\'s Almanack? The fields of asphodel? I can\'t remember a thing.\r\nEverything\'s moving, falling, slipping, vanishing.... There is a vast\r\nupheaval of matter. Someone is standing over me and saying--\r\n\r\n"I\'m going out to buy a newspaper."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Though it\'s no good buying newspapers.... Nothing ever happens. Curse\r\nthis war; God damn this war!... All the same, I don\'t see why we should\r\nhave a snail on our wall."\r\n\r\nAh, the mark on the wall! It was a snail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Monday or Tuesday, by Virginia Woolf\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MONDAY OR TUESDAY ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 29220.txt or 29220.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/2/2/29220/\r\n\r\nProduced by Meredith Bach, Martin Pettit and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\r\nbook was produced from scanned images of public domain\r\nmaterial from the Google Print project.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
