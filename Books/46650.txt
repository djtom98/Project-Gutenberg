"I would\r\nn\'t have you touch it if there was n\'t. Why, they tell me Patchly \'s\r\npulled a hundred thousand out of the concern a\'ready."\r\n\r\n"That may be," replied Offdean, who had been politely attentive to the\r\nwords addressed to him, but whose face bore a look indicating that he\r\nwas closed to conviction. He leaned back upon the clumsy stick which\r\nhe carried, and continued: "It\'s all true, I dare say, Fitch; but a\r\ndecision of that sort would mean more to me than you\'d believe if I\r\nwere to tell you. The beggarly twenty-five thousand\'s all I have, and\r\nI want to sleep with it under my pillow a couple of months at least\r\nbefore I drop it into a slot."\r\n\r\n"You \'ll drop it into Harding & Offdean\'s mill to grind out the pitiful\r\ntwo and a half per cent commission racket; that \'s what you \'ll do in\r\nthe end, old fellow--see if you don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shall; but it\'s more than likely I shan\'t. We \'ll talk\r\nabout it when I get back. You know I\'m off to north Louisiana in the\r\nmorning"--\r\n\r\n"No! What the deuce"--\r\n\r\n"Oh, business of the firm."\r\n\r\n"Write me from Shreveport, then; or wherever it is."\r\n\r\n"Not so far as that. But don\'t expect to hear from me till you see me.\r\nI can\'t say when that will be."\r\n\r\nThen they shook hands and parted. The rather portly Fitch boarded\r\na Prytania Street car, and Mr. Wallace Offdean hurried to the bank\r\nin order to replenish his portemonnaie, which had been materially\r\nlightened at the club through the medium of unpropitious jack-pots and\r\nbobtail flushes.\r\n\r\nHe was a sure-footed fellow, this young Offdean, despite an occasional\r\nfall in slippery places. What he wanted, now that he had reached his\r\ntwenty-sixth year and his inheritance, was to get his feet well planted\r\non solid ground, and to keep his head cool and clear.\r\n\r\nWith his early youth he had had certain shadowy intentions of shaping\r\nhis life on intellectual lines. That is, he wanted to; and he meant\r\nto use his faculties intelligently, which means more than is at once\r\napparent. Above all, he would keep clear of the maelstroms of sordid\r\nwork and senseless pleasure in which the average American business man\r\nmay be said alternately to exist, and which reduce him, naturally, to a\r\nrather ragged condition of soul.\r\n\r\nOffdean had done, in a temperate way, the usual things which young men\r\ndo who happen to belong to good society, and are possessed of moderate\r\nmeans and healthy instincts. He had gone to college, had traveled a\r\nlittle at home and abroad, had frequented society and the clubs, and\r\nhad worked in his uncle\'s commission-house; in all of which employments\r\nhe had expended much time and a modicum of energy.\r\n\r\nBut he felt all through that he was simply in a preliminary stage\r\nof being, one that would develop later into something tangible and\r\nintelligent, as he liked to tell himself. With his patrimony of\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars came what he felt to be the turning-point\r\nin his life,--the time when it behooved him to choose a course, and to\r\nget himself into proper trim to follow it manfully and consistently.\r\n\r\nWhen Messrs. Harding & Offdean determined to have some one look after\r\nwhat they called "a troublesome piece of land on Red River," Wallace\r\nOffdean requested to be intrusted with that special commission of\r\nland-inspector.\r\n\r\nA shadowy, ill-defined piece of land in an unfamiliar part of his\r\nnative State, might, he hoped, prove a sort of closet into which he\r\ncould retire and take counsel with his inner and better self.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Harding & Offdean had called a piece of land on Red River was\r\nbetter known to the people of Natchitoches[1] parish as "the old\r\nSantien place."\r\n\r\nIn the days of Lucien Santien and his hundred slaves, it had been very\r\nsplendid in the wealth of its thousand acres. But the war did its work,\r\nof course. Then Jules Santien was not the man to mend such damage as\r\nthe war had left. His three sons were even less able than he had been\r\nto bear the weighty inheritance of debt that came to them with the\r\ndismantled plantation; so it was a deliverance to all when Harding &\r\nOffdean, the New Orleans creditors, relieved them of the place with the\r\nresponsibility and indebtedness which its ownership had entailed.\r\n\r\nHector, the eldest, and Gr\xc3\xa9goire, the youngest of these Santien boys,\r\nhad gone each his way. Placide alone tried to keep a desultory foothold\r\nupon the land which had been his and his forefathers\'. But he too was\r\ngiven to wandering--within a radius, however, which rarely took him so\r\nfar that he could not reach the old place in an afternoon of travel,\r\nwhen he felt so inclined.\r\n\r\nThere were acres of open land cultivated in a slovenly fashion, but so\r\nrich that cotton and corn and weed and "cocoa-grass" grew rampant if\r\nthey had only the semblance of a chance. The negro quarters were at the\r\nfar end of this open stretch, and consisted of a long row of old and\r\nvery crippled cabins. Directly back of these a dense wood grew, and\r\nheld much mystery, and witchery of sound and shadow, and strange lights\r\nwhen the sun shone. Of a gin-house there was left scarcely a trace;\r\nonly so much as could serve as inadequate shelter to the miserable\r\ndozen cattle that huddled within it in winter-time.\r\n\r\nA dozen rods or more from the Red River bank stood the dwelling-house,\r\nand nowhere upon the plantation had time touched so sadly as here. The\r\nsteep, black, moss-covered roof sat like an extinguisher above the\r\neight large rooms that it covered, and had come to do its office so\r\npoorly that not more than half of these were habitable when the rain\r\nfell. Perhaps the live-oaks made too thick and close a shelter about\r\nit. The verandas were long and broad and inviting; but it was well to\r\nknow that the brick pillar was crumbling away under one corner, that\r\nthe railing was insecure at another, and that still another had long\r\nago been condemned as unsafe. But that, of course, was not the corner\r\nin which Wallace Offdean sat the day following his arrival at the\r\nSantien place. This one was comparatively secure. A gloire-de-Dijon,\r\nthick-leaved and charged with huge creamy blossoms, grew and spread\r\nhere like a hardy vine upon the wires that stretched from post to\r\npost. The scent of the blossoms was delicious; and the stillness that\r\nsurrounded Offdean agreeably fitted his humor that asked for rest. His\r\nold host, Pierre Manton, the manager of the place, sat talking to him\r\nin a soft, rhythmic monotone; but his speech was hardly more of an\r\ninterruption than the hum of the bees among the roses. He was saying:--\r\n\r\n"If it would been me myse\'f, I would nevair grumb\'. W\'en a chimbly\r\nbreck, I take one, two de boys; we patch \'im up bes\' we know how. We\r\nkeep on men\' de fence\', firs\' one place, anudder; an\' if it would n\'\r\nbe fer dem mule\' of Lacroix--_tonnerre!_ I don\' wan\' to talk \'bout dem\r\nmule\'. But me, I would n\' grumb\'. It\'s Euphrasie, hair. She say dat\'s\r\nall fool nonsense fer rich man lack Hardin\'-Offde\'n to let a piece o\'\r\nlan\' goin\' lack dat."\r\n\r\n"Euphrasie?" questioned Offdean, in some surprise; for he had not yet\r\nheard of any such person.\r\n\r\n"Euphrasie, my li\'le chile. Escuse me one minute," Pierre added,\r\nremembering that he was in his shirt-sleeves, and rising to reach for\r\nhis coat, which hung upon a peg near by. He was a small, square man,\r\nwith mild, kindly face, brown and roughened from healthy exposure. His\r\nhair hung gray and long beneath the soft felt hat that he wore. When he\r\nhad seated himself, Offdean asked:--\r\n\r\n"Where is your little child? I have n\'t seen her," inwardly marveling\r\nthat a little child should have uttered such words of wisdom as those\r\nrecorded of her.\r\n\r\n"She yonder to Mme. Duplan on Cane River. I been kine espectin\' hair\r\nsence yistiday--hair an\' Placide," casting an unconscious glance down\r\nthe long plantation road. "But Mme. Duplan she nevair want to let\r\nEuphrasie go. You know it\'s hair raise\' Euphrasie sence hair po\' ma\r\ndie\', Mr. Offde\'n. She teck dat li\'le chile, an\' raise it, sem lack\r\nshe raisin\' Ninette. But it\'s mo\' \'an a year now Euphrasie say dat\'s\r\nall fool nonsense to leave me livin\' \'lone lack dat, wid nuttin\' \'cep\'\r\ndem nigger\'--an\' Placide once a w\'ile. An\' she came yair bossin\'! My\r\ngoodness!" The old man chuckled, "Dat\'s hair been writin\' all dem\r\nletter\' to Hardin\'-Offde\'n. If it would been me myse\'f"--\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pronounced Nack-e-tosh.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacide seemed to have had a foreboding of ill from the start when he\r\nfound that Euphrasie began to interest herself in the condition of the\r\nplantation. This ill feeling voiced itself partly when he told her\r\nit was none of her lookout if the place went to the dogs. "It\'s good\r\nenough for Joe Duplan to run things _en grand seigneur_, Euphrasie;\r\nthat\'s w\'at\'s spoiled you."\r\n\r\nPlacide might have done much single-handed to keep the old place in\r\nbetter trim, if he had wished. For there was no one more clever than he\r\nto do a hand\'s turn at any and every thing. He could mend a saddle or\r\nbridle while he stood whistling a tune. If a wagon required a brace or\r\na bolt, it was nothing for him to step into a shop and turn out one as\r\ndeftly as the most skilled blacksmith. Any one seeing him at work with\r\nplane and rule and chisel would have declared him a born carpenter. And\r\nas for mixing paints, and giving a fine and lasting coat to the side of\r\na house or barn, he had not his equal in the country.\r\n\r\nThis last talent he exercised little in his native parish. It was in a\r\nneighboring one, where he spent the greater part of his time, that his\r\nfame as a painter was established. There, in the village of Orville, he\r\nowned a little shell of a house, and during odd times it was Placide\'s\r\ngreat delight to tinker at this small home, inventing daily new\r\nbeauties and conveniences to add to it. Lately it had become a precious\r\npossession to him, for in the spring he was to bring Euphrasie there as\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was because of his talent, and his indifference in turning it\r\nto good, that he was often called "a no-account creole" by thriftier\r\nsouls than himself. But no-account creole or not, painter, carpenter,\r\nblacksmith, and whatever else he might be at times, he was a Santien\r\nalways, with the best blood in the country running in his veins. And\r\nmany thought his choice had fallen in very low places when he engaged\r\nhimself to marry little Euphrasie, the daughter of old Pierre Manton\r\nand a problematic mother a good deal less than nobody.\r\n\r\nPlacide might have married almost any one, too; for it was the easiest\r\nthing in the world for a girl to fall in love with him,--- sometimes\r\nthe hardest thing in the world not to, he was such a splendid fellow,\r\nsuch a careless, happy, handsome fellow. And he did not seem to mind\r\nin the least that young men who had grown up with him were lawyers\r\nnow, and planters, and members of Shakespeare clubs in town. No\r\none ever expected anything quite so humdrum as that of the Santien\r\nboys. As youngsters, all three had been the despair of the country\r\nschool-master; then of the private tutor who had come to shackle them,\r\nand had failed in his design. And the state of mutiny and revolt\r\nthat they had brought about at the college of Grand Coteau when their\r\nfather, in a moment of weak concession to prejudice, had sent them\r\nthere, is a thing yet remembered in Natchitoches.\r\n\r\nAnd now Placide was going to marry Euphrasie. He could not recall the\r\ntime when he had not loved her. Somehow he felt that it began the\r\nday when he was six years old, and Pierre, his father\'s overseer,\r\nhad called him from play to come and make her acquaintance. He was\r\npermitted to hold her in his arms a moment, and it was with silent\r\nawe that he did so. She was the first white-faced baby he remembered\r\nhaving seen, and he straightway believed she had been sent to him as a\r\nbirthday gift to be his little play-mate and friend. If he loved her,\r\nthere was no great wonder; every one did, from the time she took her\r\nfirst dainty step, which was a brave one, too.\r\n\r\nShe was the gentlest little lady ever born in old Natchitoches parish,\r\nand the happiest and merriest. She never cried or whimpered for a\r\nhurt. Placide never did, why should she? When she wept, it was when\r\nshe did what was wrong, or when he did; for that was to be a coward,\r\nshe felt. When she was ten, and her mother was dead, Mme. Duplan, the\r\nLady Bountiful of the parish, had driven across from her plantation,\r\nLes Ch\xc3\xaaniers, to old Pierre\'s very door, and there had gathered up this\r\nprecious little maid, and carried her away, to do with as she would.\r\n\r\nAnd she did with the child much as she herself had been done by.\r\nEuphrasie went to the convent soon, and was taught all gentle things,\r\nthe pretty arts of manner and speech that the ladies of the "Sacred\r\nHeart" can teach so well. When she quitted them, she left a trail of\r\nlove behind her; she always did.\r\n\r\nPlacide continued to see her at intervals, and to love her always.\r\nOne day he told her so; he could not help it. She stood under one of\r\nthe big oaks at Les Ch\xc3\xaaniers. It was midsummer time, and the tangled\r\nsunbeams had enmeshed her in a golden fret-work. When he saw her\r\nstanding there in the sun\'s glamour, which was like a glory upon her,\r\nhe trembled. He seemed to see her for the first time. He could only\r\nlook at her, and wonder why her hair gleamed so, as it fell in those\r\nthick chestnut waves about her ears and neck. He had looked a thousand\r\ntimes into her eyes before; was it only to-day they held that sleepy,\r\nwistful light in them that invites love? How had he not seen it before?\r\nWhy had he not known before that her lips were red, and cut in fine,\r\nstrong curves? that her flesh was like cream? How had he not seen that\r\nshe was beautiful? "Euphrasie," he said, taking her hands,--"Euphrasie,\r\nI love you!"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a little astonishment. "Yes; I know, Placide."\r\nShe spoke with the soft intonation of the creole.\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t, Euphrasie. I did n\' know myse\'f how much tell jus\' now."\r\n\r\nPerhaps he did only what was natural when he asked her next if she\r\nloved him. He still held her hands. She looked thoughtfully away,\r\nunready to answer.\r\n\r\n"Do you love anybody better?" he asked jealously. "Any one jus\' as well\r\nas me?" "You know I love papa better, Placide, an\' Maman Duplan jus\' as\r\nwell."\r\n\r\nYet she saw no reason why she should not be his wife when he asked her\r\nto.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months before this, Euphrasie had returned to live with her\r\nfather. The step had cut her off from everything that girls of eighteen\r\ncall pleasure. If it cost her one regret, no one could have guessed it.\r\nShe went often to visit the Duplans, however; and Placide had gone to\r\nbring her home from Les Ch\xc3\xaaniers the very day of Offdean\'s arrival at\r\nthe plantation.\r\n\r\nThey had traveled by rail to Natchitoches, where they found Pierre\'s\r\nno-top buggy awaiting them, for there was a drive of five miles to be\r\nmade through the pine woods before the plantation was reached. When\r\nthey were at their journey\'s end, and had driven some distance; up\r\nthe long plantation road that led to the house in the rear, Euphrasie\r\nexclaimed:--\r\n\r\n"W\'y, there\'s some one on the gall\'ry with papa, Placide!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I see."\r\n\r\n"It looks like some one f\'om town. It mus\' be Mr. Gus Adams; but I don\'\r\nsee his horse."\r\n\r\n"\'T ain\'t no one f\'om town that I know. It\'s boun\' to be some one f\'om\r\nthe city."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Placide, I should n\' wonder if Harding & Offdean have sent some\r\none to look after the place at las\'," she exclaimed a little excitedly.\r\n\r\nThey were near enough to see that the stranger was a young man of very\r\npleasing appearance. Without apparent reason, a chilly depression took\r\nhold of Placide.\r\n\r\n"I tole you it was n\' yo\' lookout f\'om the firs\', Euphrasie," he said\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallace Offdean remembered Euphrasie at once as a young person whom\r\nhe had assisted to a very high perch on his club-house balcony the\r\nprevious Mardi Gras night. He had thought her pretty and attractive\r\nthen, and for the space of a day or two wondered who she might be. But\r\nhe had not made even so fleeting an impression upon her; seeing which,\r\nhe did not refer to any former meeting when Pierre introduced them.\r\n\r\nShe took the chair which he offered her, and asked him very simply when\r\nhe had come, if his journey had been pleasant, and if he had not found\r\nthe road from Natchitoches in very good condition.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Offde\'n only come sence yistiday, Euphrasie," interposed Pierre.\r\n"We been talk\' plenty \'bout de place, him an\' me. I been tole \'im all\r\n\'bout it--_va!_ An\' if Mr. Offde\'n want to escuse me now, I b\'lieve I\r\ngo he\'p Placide wid dat hoss an\' buggy;" and he descended the steps\r\nslowly, and walked lazily with his bent figure in the direction of the\r\nshed beneath which Placide had driven, after depositing Euphrasie at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"I dare say you find it strange," began. Offdean, "that the owners of\r\nthis place have neglected it so long and shamefully. But you see," he\r\nadded, smiling, "the management of a plantation does n\'t enter into\r\nthe routine of a commission merchant\'s business. The place has already\r\ncost them more than they hope to get from it, and naturally they have\r\nn\'t the wish to sink further money in it." He did not know why he was\r\nsaying these things to a mere girl, but he went on: "I\'m authorized to\r\nsell the plantation if I can get anything like a reasonable price for\r\nit." Euphrasie laughed in a way that made him uncomfortable, and he\r\nthought he would say no more at present,--not till he knew her better,\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\n"Well," she said in a very decided fashion, "I know you \'ll fin\' one\r\nor two persons in town who \'ll begin by running down the lan\' till you\r\nwould n\' want it as a gif\', Mr. Offdean; and who will en\' by offering\r\nto take it off yo\' han\'s for the promise of a song, with the lan\' as\r\nsecurity again."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, and Placide, who was approaching, scowled. But\r\nbefore he reached the steps his instinctive sense of the courtesy due\r\nto a stranger had banished the look of ill humor. His bearing was so\r\nfrank and graceful, and his face such a marvel of beauty, with its\r\ndark, rich coloring and soft lines, that the well-clipped and groomed\r\nOffdean felt his astonishment to be more than half admiration when\r\nthey shook hands. He knew that the Santiens had been the former owners\r\nof this plantation which he had come to look after, and naturally he\r\nexpected some sort of cooperation or direct assistance from Placide in\r\nhis efforts at reconstruction. But Placide proved non-committal, and\r\nexhibited an indifference and ignorance concerning the condition of\r\naffairs that savored surprisingly of affectation.\r\n\r\nHe had positively nothing to say so long as the talk touched upon\r\nmatters concerning Offdean\'s business there. He was only a little less\r\ntaciturn when more general topics were approached, and directly after\r\nsupper he saddled his horse and went away. He would not wait until\r\nmorning, for the moon would be rising about midnight, and he knew the\r\nroad as well by night as by day. He knew just where the best fords were\r\nacross the bayous, and the safest paths across the hills. He knew for\r\na certainty whose plantations he might traverse, and whose fences he\r\nmight derail. But, for that matter, he would derail what he liked, and\r\ncross where he pleased.\r\n\r\nEuphrasie walked with him to the shed when he went for his horse. She\r\nwas bewildered at his sudden determination, and wanted it explained.\r\n\r\n"I don\' like that man," he admitted frankly; "I can\'t stan\' him. Sen\'\r\nme word w\'en he\'s gone, Euphrasie."\r\n\r\nShe was patting and rubbing the pony, which knew her well. Only their\r\ndim outlines were discernible in the thick darkness.\r\n\r\n"You are foolish, Placide," she replied in French. "You would do better\r\nto stay and help him. No one knows the place so well as you"--\r\n\r\n"The place isn\'t mine, and it\'s nothing to me," he answered bitterly.\r\nHe took her hands and kissed them passionately, but stooping, she\r\npressed her lips upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he exclaimed rapturously, "you do love me, Euphrasie?" His arms\r\nwere holding her, and his lips brushing her hair and cheeks as they\r\neagerly but ineffectually sought hers.\r\n\r\n"Of co\'se I love you, Placide. Ain\'t I going to marry you nex\' spring?\r\nYou foolish boy!" she replied, disengaging herself from his clasp.\r\n\r\nWhen he was mounted, he stooped to say, "See yere, Euphrasie, don\'t\r\nhave too much to do with that d---- Yankee."\r\n\r\n"But, Placide, he is n\'t a--a--\'d---- Yankee;\' he\'s a Southerner, like\r\nyou,--a New Orleans man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, he looks like a Yankee." But Placide laughed, for he was\r\nhappy since Euphrasie had kissed him, and he whistled softly as he\r\nurged his horse to a canter and disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood awhile with clasped hands, trying to understand a little\r\nsigh that rose in her throat, and that was not one of regret. When shew\r\nregained the house, she went directly to her room, and left her father\r\ntalking to Offdean in the quiet and perfumed night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen two weeks had passed, Offdean felt very much at home with old\r\nPierre and his daughter, and found the business that had called him\r\nto the country so engrossing that he had given no thought to those\r\npersonal questions he had hoped to solve in going there.\r\n\r\nThe old man had driven him around in the no-top buggy to show him how\r\ndismantled the fences and barns were. He could see for himself that the\r\nhouse was a constant menace to human life. In the evenings the three\r\nwould sit out on the gallery and talk of the land and its strong points\r\nand its weak ones, till he came to know it as if it had been his own.\r\n\r\nOf the rickety condition of the cabins he got a fair notion, for he\r\nand Euphrasie passed them almost daily on horseback, on their way to\r\nthe woods. It was seldom that their appearance together did not rouse\r\ncomment among the darkies who happened to be loitering about.\r\n\r\nLa Chatte, a broad black woman with ends of white wool sticking out\r\nfrom under her _tignon_, stood with arms _akimbo_ watching them as they\r\ndisappeared one day. Then she turned and said to a young woman who sat\r\nin the cabin door:--\r\n\r\n"Dat young man, ef he want to listen to me, he gwine quit dat ar\r\ncaperin\' roun\' Miss \'Phrasie."\r\n\r\nThe young woman in the doorway laughed, and showed her white teeth, and\r\ntossed her head, and fingered the blue beads at her throat, in a way to\r\nindicate that she was in hearty sympathy with any question that touched\r\nupon gallantry.\r\n\r\n"Law! La Chatte, you ain\' gwine hinder a gemman f\'om payin\' intentions\r\nto a young lady w\'en he a mine to."\r\n\r\n"Dat all I got to say," returned La Chatte, seating herself lazily and\r\nheavily on the doorstep. "Nobody don\' know dem Sanchun boys bettah \'an\r\nI does. Did n\' I done part raise \'em? W\'at you reckon my ha\'r all tu\'n\r\nplumb w\'ite dat-a-way ef it warn\'t dat Placide w\'at done it?"\r\n\r\n"How come he make yo\' ha\'r tu\'n w\'ite, La Chatte?"\r\n\r\n"Dev\'ment, pu\' dev\'ment, Rose. Did n\' he come in dat same cabin one\r\nday, w\'en he warn\'t no bigga \'an dat Pres\'dent Hayes w\'at you sees\r\ngwine \'long de road wid dat cotton sack \'crost \'im? He come an\' sets\r\ndown by de do\', on dat same t\'ree-laigged stool w\'at you\'s a-settin\'\r\non now, wid his gun in his ban\', an\' he say: \'La Chatte, I wants some\r\ncroquignoles, an\' I wants \'em quick, too.\' I \'low: \'G\' \'way f\'om dah,\r\nboy. Don\' you see I\'s flutin\' yo\' ma\'s petticoat?\' He say: \'La Chatte,\r\nput \'side dat ar flutin\'i\'on an\' dat ar petticoat;\' an\' he cock dat gun\r\nan\' p\'int it to my head. \'Dar de ba\'el,\' he say; \'git out dat flour,\r\ngit out dat butta an\' dat aigs; step roun\' dah, ole \'oman.

Ef I goes to de fiah, de gun\'s ar-p\'intin\'. W\'en I rolls\r\nout de dough, de gun\'s a-p\'intin\'; an\' him neva say nuttin\', an\' me\r\na-trim\'lin\' like ole Uncle Noah w\'en de mis\'ry strike \'im."\r\n\r\n"Lordy! w\'at you reckon he do ef he tu\'n roun\' an\' git mad wid dat\r\nyoung gemman f\'om de city?"\r\n\r\n"I don\' reckon nuttin\'; I knows w\'at he gwine do,--same w\'at his pa\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"W\'at his pa done, La Chatte?"\r\n\r\n"G\' \'long \'bout yo\' business; you\'s axin\' too many questions." And La\r\nChatte arose slowly and went to gather her party-colored wash that hung\r\ndrying on the jagged and irregular points of a dilapidated picket-fence.\r\n\r\nBut the darkies were mistaken in supposing that Offdean was paying\r\nattention to Euphrasie. Those little jaunts in the wood were purely of\r\na business character. Offdean had made a contract with a neighboring\r\nmill for fencing, in exchange for a certain amount of uncut timber. He\r\nhad made it his work--with the assistance of Euphrasie--to decide upon\r\nwhat trees he wanted felled, and to mark such for the woodman\'s axe.\r\n\r\nIf they sometimes forgot what they had gone into the woods for, it was\r\nbecause there was so much to talk about and to laugh about. Often, when\r\nOffdean had blazed a tree with the sharp hatchet which he carried at\r\nhis pommel, and had further discharged his duty by calling it "a fine\r\npiece of timber," they would sit upon some fallen and decaying trunk,\r\nmaybe to listen to a chorus of mocking-birds above their heads, or to\r\nexchange confidences, as young people will.\r\n\r\nEuphrasie thought she had never heard any one talk quite so pleasantly\r\nas Offdean did. She could not decide whether it was his manner or the\r\ntone of his voice, or the earnest glance of his dark and deep-set blue\r\neyes, that gave such meaning to everything he said; for she found\r\nherself afterward thinking of his every word.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon it rained in torrents, and Rose was forced to drag\r\nbuckets and tubs into Offdean\'s room to catch the streams that\r\nthreatened to flood it. Euphrasie said she was glad of it; now he could\r\nsee for himself.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had seen for himself, he went to join her out on a corner\r\nof the gallery, where she stood with a cloak around her, close up\r\nagainst the house. He leaned against the house, too, and they stood\r\nthus together, gazing upon as desolate a scene as it is easy to imagine.\r\n\r\nThe whole landscape was gray, seen through the driving rain. Far away\r\nthe dreary cabins seemed to sink and sink to earth in abject misery.\r\nAbove their heads the live-oak branches were beating with sad monotony\r\nagainst the blackened roof. Great pools of water had formed in the\r\nyard, which was deserted by every living thing; for the little darkies\r\nhad scampered away to their cabins, the dogs had run to their kennels,\r\nand the hens were puffing big with wretchedness under the scanty\r\nshelter of a fallen wagon-body.\r\n\r\nCertainly a situation to make a young man groan with ennui, if he is\r\nused to his daily stroll on Canal Street, and pleasant afternoons at\r\nthe club. But Offdean thought it delightful. He only wondered that he\r\nhad never known, or some one had never told him, how charming a place\r\nan old, dismantled plantation can be--when it rains. But as well as he\r\nliked it, he could not linger there forever. Business called him back\r\nto New Orleans, and after a few days he went away.\r\n\r\nThe interest which he felt in the improvement of this plantation was\r\nof so deep a nature, however, that he found himself thinking of it\r\nconstantly. He wondered if the timber had all been felled, and how the\r\nfencing was coming on. So great was his desire to know such things\r\nthat much correspondence was required between himself and Euphrasie,\r\nand he watched eagerly for those letters that told him of her trials\r\nand vexations with carpenters, bricklayers, and shingle--bearers. But\r\nin the midst of it, Offdean suddenly lost interest in the progress of\r\nwork on the plantation. Singularly enough, it happened simultaneously\r\nwith the arrival of a letter from Euphrasie which announced in a modest\r\npostscript that she was going down to the city with the Duplans for\r\nMardi Gras.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Offdean learned that Euphrasie was coming to New Orleans, he was\r\ndelighted to think he would have an opportunity to make some return for\r\nthe hospitality which he had received from her father. He decided at\r\nonce that she must see everything: day processions and night parades,\r\nballs and tableaux, operas and plays. He would arrange for it all, and\r\nhe went to the length of begging to be relieved of certain duties that\r\nhad been assigned him at the club, in order that he might feel himself\r\nperfectly free to do so.\r\n\r\nThe evening following Euphrasie\'s arrival, Offdean hastened to call\r\nupon her, away down on Esplanade Street. She and the Duplans were\r\nstaying there with old Mme. Carantelle, Mrs. Duplan\'s mother, a\r\ndelightfully conservative old lady who had not "crossed Canal Street"\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nHe found a number of people gathered in the long high-ceiled\r\ndrawing-room,--young people and old people, all talking French, and\r\nsome talking louder than they would have done if Madame Carantelle had\r\nnot been so very deaf.\r\n\r\nWhen Offdean entered, the old lady was greeting some one who had come\r\nin just before him. It was Placide, and she was calling him Gr\xc3\xa9goire,\r\nand wanting to know how the crops were up on Red River. She met every\r\none from the country with this stereotyped inquiry, which placed her at\r\nonce on the agreeable and easy footing she liked.\r\n\r\nSomehow Offdean had not counted on finding Euphrasie so well provided\r\nwith entertainment, and he spent much of the evening in trying to\r\npersuade himself that the fact was a pleasing one in itself. But he\r\nwondered why Placide was with her, and sat so persistently beside her,\r\nand danced so repeatedly with her when Mrs. Duplan played upon the\r\npiano. Then he could not see by what right these young creoles had\r\nalready arranged for the Proteus ball, and every other entertainment\r\nthat he had meant to provide for her.\r\n\r\nHe went away without having had a word alone with the girl whom he\r\nhad gone to see. The evening had proved a failure. He did not go to\r\nthe club as usual, but went to his rooms in a mood which inclined\r\nhim to read a few pages from a stoic philosopher whom he sometimes\r\naffected. But the words of wisdom that had often before helped him over\r\ndisagreeable places left no impress to-night. They were powerless to\r\nbanish from his thoughts the look of a pair of brown eyes, or to drown\r\nthe tones of a girl\'s voice that kept singing in his soul.\r\n\r\nPlacide was not very well acquainted with the city; but that made no\r\ndifference to him so long as he was at Euphrasie\'s side. His brother\r\nHector, who lived in some obscure corner of the town, would willingly\r\nhave made his knowledge a more intimate one; but Placide did not choose\r\nto learn the lessons that Hector was ready to teach. He asked nothing\r\nbetter than to walk with Euphrasie along the streets, holding her\r\nparasol at an agreeable angle over her pretty head, or to sit beside\r\nher in the evening at the play, sharing her frank delight.\r\n\r\nWhen the night of the Mardi Gras ball came, he felt like a lost spirit\r\nduring the hours he was forced to remain away from her. He stood in\r\nthe dense crowd on the street gazing up at her, where she sat on the\r\nclub-house balcony amid a bevy of gayly dressed women. It was not easy\r\nto distinguish her, but he could think of no more agreeable occupation\r\nthan to stand down there on the street trying to do so.\r\n\r\nShe seemed during all this pleasant time to be entirely his own,\r\ntoo. It made him very fierce to think of the possibility of her not\r\nbeing entirely his own. But he had no cause whatever to think this.\r\nShe had grown conscious and thoughtful of late about him and their\r\nrelationship. She often communed with herself, and as a result tried\r\nto act toward him as an engaged girl would toward her fianc\xc3\xa9. Yet a\r\nwistful look came sometimes into the brown eyes when she walked the\r\nstreets with Placide, and eagerly scanned the faces of passers-by.\r\n\r\nOffdean had written her a note, very studied, very formal, asking\r\nto see her a certain day and hour, to consult about matters on the\r\nplantation, saying he had found it so difficult to obtain a word with\r\nher, that he was forced to adopt this means, which he trusted would not\r\nbe offensive.\r\n\r\nThis seemed perfectly right to Euphrasie. She agreed to see him\r\none afternoon--the day before leaving town--in the long, stately\r\ndrawing-room, quite alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a sleepy day, too warm for the season. Gusts of moist air\r\nwere sweeping lazily through the long corridors, rattling the slats\r\nof the half-closed green shutters, and bringing a delicious perfume\r\nfrom the courtyard where old Chariot was watering the spreading palms\r\nand brilliant parterres. A group of little children had stood awhile\r\nquarreling noisily under the windows, but had moved on down the street\r\nand left quietness reigning.\r\n\r\nOffdean had not long to wait before Euphrasie came to him. She had\r\nlost some of that ease which had marked her manner during their first\r\nacquaintance. Now, when she seated herself before him, she showed a\r\ndisposition to plunge at once into the subject that had brought him\r\nthere. He was willing enough that it should play some r\xc3\xb4le, since it\r\nhad been his pretext for coming; but he soon dismissed it, and with it\r\nmuch restraint that had held him till now. He simply looked into her\r\neyes, with a gaze that made her shiver a little, and began to complain\r\nbecause she was going away next day and he had seen nothing of her;\r\nbecause he had wanted to do so many things when she came--why had she\r\nnot let him?\r\n\r\n"You fo\'get I\'m no stranger here," she told him. "I know many people.\r\nI\'ve been coming so often with Mme. Duplan. I wanted to see mo\' of you,\r\nMr. Offdean"--\r\n\r\n"Then you ought to have managed it; you could have done so. It\'s--it\'s\r\naggravating," he said, far more bitterly than the subject warranted,\r\n"when a man has so set his heart upon something."\r\n\r\n"But it was n\' anything ver\' important," she interposed; and they both\r\nlaughed, and got safely over a situation that would soon have been\r\nstrained, if not critical.\r\n\r\nWaves of happiness were sweeping through the soul and body of the\r\ngirl as she sat there in the drowsy afternoon near the man whom she\r\nloved. It mattered not what they talked about, or whether they talked\r\nat all. They were both scintillant with feeling. If Offdean had taken\r\nEuphrasie\'s hands in his and leaned forward and kissed her lips, it\r\nwould have seemed to both only the rational outcome of things that\r\nstirred them. But he did not do this. He knew now that overwhelming\r\npassion was taking possession of him. He had not to heap more coals\r\nupon the fire; on the contrary, it was a moment to put on the brakes,\r\nand he was a young gentleman able to do this when circumstances\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nHowever, he held her hand longer than he needed to when he bade her\r\ngood-by. For he got entangled in explaining why he should have to go\r\nback to the plantation to see how matters stood there, and he dropped\r\nher hand only when the rambling speech was ended.\r\n\r\nHe left her sitting by the window in a big brocaded armchair. She drew\r\nthe lace curtain aside to watch him pass in the street. He lifted his\r\nhat and smiled when he saw her. Any other man she knew would have done\r\nthe same thing, but this simple act caused the blood to surge to her\r\ncheeks. She let the curtain drop, and sat there like one dreaming. Her\r\neyes, intense with the unnatural light that glowed in them, looked\r\nsteadily into vacancy, and her lips stayed parted in the half-smile\r\nthat did not want to leave them.\r\n\r\nPlacide found her thus, a good while afterward, when he came in, full\r\nof bustle, with theatre tickets in his pocket for the last night. She\r\nstarted up, and went eagerly to meet him.\r\n\r\n"W\'ere have you been, Placide?" she asked with unsteady voice, placing\r\nher hands on his shoulders with a freedom that was new and strange to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe appeared to her suddenly as a refuge from something, she did not\r\nknow what, and she rested her hot cheek against his breast. This made\r\nhim mad, and he lifted her face and kissed her passionately upon the\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nShe crept from his arms after that, and went away to her room, and\r\nlocked herself in. Her poor little inexperienced soul was torn and\r\nsore. She knelt down beside her bed, and sobbed a little and prayed a\r\nlittle. She felt that she had sinned, she did not know exactly in what;\r\nbut a fine nature warned her that it was in Placide\'s kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring came early in Orville, and so subtly that no one could tell\r\nexactly when it began. But one morning the roses were so luscious in\r\nPlacide\'s sunny parterres, the peas and bean-vines and borders of\r\nstrawberries so rank in his trim vegetable patches, that he called out\r\nlustily, "No mo\' winta, Judge!" to the staid Judge Blount, who went\r\nambling by on his gray pony.\r\n\r\n"There\'s right smart o\' folks don\'t know it, Santien," responded the\r\njudge, with occult meaning that might be applied to certain indebted\r\nclients back on the bayou who had not broken land yet. Ten minutes\r\nlater the judge observed sententiously, and apropos of nothing, to a\r\ngroup that stood waiting for the post-office to open:--\r\n\r\n"I see Santien\'s got that noo fence o\' his painted. And a pretty piece\r\no\' work it is," he added reflectively.\r\n\r\n"Look lack Placide goin\' pent mo\' \'an de fence," sagaciously snickered\r\n\'Tit-Edouard, a strolling _maigre-\xc3\xa9chine_ of indefinite occupation.\r\n"I seen \'im, me, pesterin\' wid all kine o\' pent on a piece o\' bo\'d\r\nyistiday."\r\n\r\n"I knows he gwine paint mo\' \'an de fence," emphatically announced Uncle\r\nAbner, in a tone that carried conviction.\r\n\r\n"He gwine paint de house; dat what he gwine do. Did n\' Marse Luke\r\nWilliams orda de paints? An\' did n\' I done kyar\' \'em up dah myse\'f?"\r\n\r\nSeeing the deference with which this positive piece of knowledge was\r\nreceived, the judge coolly changed the subject by announcing that Luke\r\nWilliams\'s Durham bull had broken a leg the night before in Luke\'s\r\nnew pasture ditch,--a piece of news that fell among his hearers with\r\ntelling, if paralytic effect.\r\n\r\nBut most people wanted to see for themselves these astonishing things\r\nthat Placide was doing. And the young ladies of the village strolled\r\nslowly by of afternoons in couples and arm in arm. If Placide happened\r\nto see them, he would leave his work to hand them a fine rose or a\r\nbunch of geraniums over the dazzling white fence. But if it chanced to\r\nbe \'Tit-Edouard or Luke Williams, or any of the young men of Orville,\r\nhe pretended not to see them, or to hear the ingratiating cough that\r\naccompanied their lingering footsteps.\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to have his home sweet and attractive for Euphrasie\'s\r\ncoming, Placide had gone less frequently than ever before up to\r\nNatchitoches. He worked and whistled and sang until the yearning for\r\nthe girl\'s presence became a driving need; then he would put away his\r\ntools and mount his horse as the day was closing, and away he would\r\ngo across bayous and hills and fields until he was with her again. She\r\nhad never seemed to Placide so lovable as she was then. She had grown\r\nmore womanly and thoughtful. Her cheek had lost much of its color, and\r\nthe light in her eyes flashed less often. But her manner had gained a\r\nsomething of pathetic tenderness toward her lover that moved him with\r\nan intoxicating happiness. He could hardly wait with patience for that\r\nday in early April which would see the fulfillment of his lifelong\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nAfter Euphrasie\'s departure from New Orleans, Offdean told himself\r\nhonestly that he loved the girl. But being yet unsettled in life, he\r\nfelt it was no time to think of marrying, and, like the worldly-wise\r\nyoung gentleman that he was, resolved to forget the little Natchitoches\r\ngirl. He knew it would be an affair of some difficulty, but not an\r\nimpossible thing, so he set about forgetting her.\r\n\r\nThe effort made him singularly irascible. At the office he was gloomy\r\nand taciturn; at the club he was a bear. A few young ladies whom he\r\ncalled upon were astonished and distressed at the cynical views of life\r\nwhich he had so suddenly adopted.\r\n\r\nWhen he had endured a week or more of such humor, and inflicted it\r\nupon others, he abruptly changed his tactics. He decided not to fight\r\nagainst his love for Euphrasie. He would not marry her,--certainly not;\r\nbut he would let himself love her to his heart\'s bent, until that love\r\nshould die a natural death, and not a violent one as he had designed.\r\nHe abandoned himself completely to his passion, and dreamed of the girl\r\nby day and thought of her by night. How delicious had been the scent\r\nof her hair, the warmth of her breath, the nearness of her body, that\r\nrainy day when they stood close together upon the veranda! He recalled\r\nthe glance of her honest, beautiful eyes, that told him things which\r\nmade his heart beat fast now when he thought of them. And then her\r\nvoice! Was there another like it when she laughed or when she talked!\r\nWas there another woman in the world possessed of so alluring a charm\r\nas this one he loved!\r\n\r\nHe was not bearish now, with these sweet thoughts crowding his brain\r\nand thrilling his blood; but he sighed deeply, and worked languidly,\r\nand enjoyed himself listlessly.\r\n\r\nOne day he sat in his room puffing the air thick with sighs and smoke,\r\nwhen a thought came suddenly to him--an inspiration, a very message\r\nfrom heaven, to judge from the cry of joy with which he greeted it. He\r\nsent his cigar whirling through the window, over the stone paving of\r\nthe street, and he let his head fall down upon his arms, folded upon\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nIt had happened to him, as it does to many, that the solution of a\r\nvexed question flashed upon him when he was hoping least for it. He\r\npositively laughed aloud, and somewhat hysterically. In the space of a\r\nmoment he saw the whole delicious future which a kind fate had mapped\r\nout for him: those rich acres upon the Red River his own, bought and\r\nembellished with his inheritance; and Euphrasie, whom he loved, his\r\nwife and companion throughout a life such as he knew now he had craved\r\nfor,--a life that, imposing bodily activity, admits the intellectual\r\nrepose in which thought unfolds.\r\n\r\nWallace Offdean was like one to whom a divinity had revealed his\r\nvocation in life,--no less a divinity because it was love. If doubts\r\nassailed him of Euphrasie\'s consent, they were soon stilled. For had\r\nthey not spoken over and over to each other the mute and subtile\r\nlanguage of reciprocal love--out under the forest trees, and in the\r\nquiet night-time on the plantation when the stars shone? And never so\r\nplainly as in the stately old drawing-room down on, Esplanade Street.\r\nSurely no other speech was needed then, save such as their eyes told.\r\nOh, he knew that she loved him; he was sure of it! The knowledge made\r\nhim all the more eager now to hasten to her, to tell her that he wanted\r\nher for his very own.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Offdean had stopped in Natchitoches on his way to the plantation,\r\nhe would have heard something there to astonish him, to say the very\r\nleast; for the whole town was talking of Euphrasie\'s wedding, which\r\nwas to take place in a few days. But he did not linger. After securing\r\na horse at the stable, he pushed on with all the speed of which the\r\nanimal was capable, and only in such company as his eager thoughts\r\nafforded him.\r\n\r\nThe plantation was very quiet, with that stillness which broods over\r\nbroad, clean acres that furnish no refuge for so much as a bird that\r\nsings. The negroes were scattered about the fields at work, with hoe\r\nand plow, under the sun, and old Pierre, on his horse, was far off in\r\nthe midst of them.\r\n\r\nPlacide had arrived in the morning, after traveling all night, and had\r\ngone to his room for an hour or two of rest. He had drawn the lounge\r\nclose up to the window to get what air he might through the closed\r\nshutters. He was just beginning to doze when he heard Euphrasie\'s light\r\nfootsteps approaching. She stopped and seated herself so near that he\r\ncould have touched her if he had but reached out his hand. Her nearness\r\nbanished all desire to sleep, and he lay there content to rest his\r\nlimbs and think of her.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the gallery on which Euphrasie sat was facing the river,\r\nand away from the road by which Offdean had reached the house. After\r\nfastening his horse, he mounted the steps, and traversed the broad hall\r\nthat intersected the house from end to end, and that was open wide. He\r\nfound Euphrasie engaged upon a piece of sewing. She was hardly aware of\r\nhis presence before he had seated himself beside her.\r\n\r\nShe could not spesik. She only looked at him with frightened eyes, as\r\nif his presence were that of some disembodied spirit.\r\n\r\n"Are you not glad that I have come?" he asked her. "Have I made a\r\nmistake in coming?" He was gazing into her eyes, seeking to read the\r\nmeaning of their new, and strange expression.\r\n\r\n"Am I glad?" she faltered. "I don\' know. W\'at has that to do? You\'ve\r\ncome to see the work, of co\'se. It\'s--it\'s only half done, Mr. Offdean.\r\nThey would n\' listen to me or to papa, an\' you did n\' seem to care."\r\n\r\n"I have n\'t come to see the work," he said, with a smile of love and\r\nconfidence. "I am here only to see you,--to say how much I want you,\r\nand need you--to tell you how I love you."\r\n\r\nShe rose, half choking with words she could not utter. But he seized\r\nher hands and held her there.\r\n\r\n"The plantation is mine, Euphrasie,--or it will be when you say that\r\nyou will be my wife," he went on excitedly. "I know that you love me"--\r\n\r\n"I do not!" she exclaimed wildly. "W\'at do you mean? How do you dare,"\r\nshe gasped, "to say such things w\'en you know that in two days I shall\r\nbe married to Placide" The last was said in a whisper; it was like a\r\nwail.\r\n\r\n"Married to Placide!" he echoed, as if striving to understand,--to\r\ngrasp some part of his own stupendous folly and blindness. "I knew\r\nnothing of it," he said hoarsely. "Married to Placide! I would never\r\nhave spoken to you as I did, if I had known. You believe me, I hope?\r\nPlease say that you forgive me."\r\n\r\nHe spoke with long silences between his utterances.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there is n\' anything to fo\'give. You\'ve only made a mistake.\r\nPlease leave me, Mr. Offdean. Papa is out in the fiel\', I think, if you\r\nwould like to speak with him. Placide is somew\'ere on the place."\r\n\r\n"I shall mount my horse and go see what work has been done," said\r\nOffdean, rising. An unusual pallor had overspread his face, and his\r\nmouth was drawn with suppressed pain. "I must turn my fool\'s errand to\r\nsome practical good," he added, with a sad attempt at playfulness; and\r\nwith no further word he walked quickly away.\r\n\r\nShe listened to his going. Then all the wretchedness of the past\r\nmonths, together with the sharp distress of the moment, voiced itself\r\nin a sob: "O God--O my God, he\'p me!"\r\n\r\nBut she could not stay out there in the broad day for any chance comer\r\nto look upon her uncovered sorrow.\r\n\r\nPlacide heard her rise and goto her room. When he had heard the key\r\nturn in the lock, he got up, and with quiet deliberation prepared to\r\ngo out. He drew on his boots, then his coat. He took his pistol from\r\nthe dressing-bureau, where he had placed it a while before, and after\r\nexamining its chambers carefully, thrust it into his pocket. He had\r\ncertain work to do with the weapon before night. But for Euphrasie\'s\r\npresence he might have accomplished it very surely a moment ago, when\r\nthe hound--as he called him--stood outside his window. He did not wish\r\nher to know anything of his movements, and he left his room as quietly\r\nas possible, and mounted his horse, as Offdean had done.\r\n\r\n"La Chatte," called Placide to the old woman, who stood in her yard at\r\nthe wash-tub, "w\'ich way did that man go?"\r\n\r\n"W\'at man dat? I is n\' studyin\' \'bout no mans; I got \'nough to do wid\r\ndis heah washin\'. \'Fo\' God, I don\' know w\'at man you\'s talkin\' \'bout"--\r\n\r\n"La Chatte, w\'ich way did that man go? Quick, now!" with the\r\ndeliberate tone and glance that had always quelled her.\r\n\r\n"Ef you \'s talkin\' \'bout dat Noo Orleans man, I could \'a\' tole you dat.\r\nHe done tuck de road to de cocoa-patch," plunging her black arms into\r\nthe tub with unnecessary energy and disturbance.\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough. I know now he\'s gone into the woods. You always was a\r\nliar, La Chatte."\r\n\r\n"Dat his own lookout, de smoove-tongue\' raskil," soliloquized the woman\r\na moment later. "I done said he did n\' have no call to come heah,\r\ncaperin\' roun\' Miss \'Phrasie."\r\n\r\nPlacide was possessed by only one thought, which was a want as\r\nwell,--to put an end to this man who had come between him and his love.\r\nIt was the same brute passion that drives the beast to slay when he\r\nsees the object of his own desire laid hold of by another.\r\n\r\nHe had heard Euphrasie tell the man she did not love him, but what of\r\nthat? Had he not heard her sobs, and guessed what her distress was? It\r\nneeded no very flexible mind to guess as much, when a hundred signs\r\nbesides, unheeded before, came surging to his memory. Jealousy held\r\nhim, and rage and despair.\r\n\r\nOffdean, as he rode along under the trees in apathetic despondency,\r\nheard some one approaching him on horseback, and turned aside to make\r\nroom in the narrow pathway.\r\n\r\nIt was not a moment for punctilious scruples, and Placide had not been\r\nhindered by such from sending a bullet into the back of his rival. The\r\nonly thing that stayed him was that Offdean must know why he had to die.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Offdean," Placide said, reining his horse with one hand, while he\r\nheld his pistol openly in the other, "I was in my room \'w\'ile ago, and\r\nyeared w\'at you said to Euphrasie. I would \'a\' killed you then if she\r\nhad n\' been \'longside o\' you. I could \'a\' killed you jus\' now w\'en I\r\ncome up behine you."\r\n\r\n"Well, why did n\'t you?" asked Offdean, meanwhile gathering his\r\nfaculties to think how he had best deal with this madman.\r\n\r\n"Because I wanted you to know who done it, an\' w\'at he done it for."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Santien, I suppose to a person in your frame of mind it will make\r\nno difference to know that I\'m unarmed. But if you make any attempt\r\nupon my life, I shall certainly defend myself as best I can."\r\n\r\n"Defen\' yo\'se\'f, then."\r\n\r\n"You must be mad," said Offdean, quickly, and looking straight into\r\nPlacide\'s eyes, "to want to soil your happiness with murder. I thought\r\na creole knew better than that how to love a woman."\r\n\r\n"By----! are you goin\' to learn me how to love a woman?"\r\n\r\n"No, Placide," said Offdean eagerly, as they rode slowly along; "your\r\nown honor is going to tell you that. The way to love a woman is to\r\nthink first of her happiness. If you love Euphrasie, you must go to her\r\nclean. I love her myself enough to want you to do that. I shall leave\r\nthis place to-morrow; you will never see me again if I can help it. Is\r\nn\'t that enough for you? I\'m going to turn here and leave you. Shoot me\r\nin the back if you like; but I know you won\'t." And Offdean held out\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n"I don\' want to shake han\'s with you," said Placide sulkily. "Go \'way\r\nf\'om me." He stayed motionless watching Offdean ride away. He looked at\r\nthe pistol in his hand, and replaced it slowly in his pocket; then he\r\nremoved the broad felt hat which he wore, and wiped away the moisture\r\nthat had gathered upon his forehead.\r\n\r\nOffdean\'s words had touched some chord within him and made it vibrant;\r\nbut they made him hate the man no less.\r\n\r\n"The way to love a woman is to think firs\' of her happiness," he\r\nmuttered reflectively. "He thought a creole knew how to love. Does he\r\nreckon he\'s goin\' to learn a creole how to love?"\r\n\r\nHis face was white and set with despair now. The rage had all left it\r\nas he rode deeper on into the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffdean rose early, wishing to take the morning train to the city. But\r\nhe was not before Euphrasie, whom he found in the large hall arranging\r\nthe breakfast-table. Old Pierre was there too, walking slowly about\r\nwith hands folded behind him, and with bowed head.\r\n\r\nA restraint hung upon all of them, and the girl turned to her father\r\nand asked him if Placide were up, seemingly for want of something to\r\nsay. The old man fell heavily into a chair, and gazed upon her in the\r\ndeepest distress.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my po\' li\'le Euphrasie! my po\' li\'le chile! Mr. Offde\'n, you ain\'t\r\nno stranger."\r\n\r\n"_Bon Dieu_! Papa!" cried the girl sharply, seized with a vague\r\nterror. She quitted her occupation at the table, and stood in nervous\r\napprehension of what might follow.\r\n\r\n"I yaired people say Placide was one no-\'count creole. I nevair want\r\nto believe dat, me. Now I know dat\'s true. Mr. Offde\'n, you ain\'t no\r\nstranger, you."\r\n\r\nOffdean was gazing upon the old man in amazement.\r\n\r\n"In de night," Pierre continued, "I yaired some noise on de winder. I\r\ngo open, an\' dere Placide, standin\' wid his big boot\' on, an\' his w\'ip\r\nw\'at he knocked wid on de winder, an\' his hoss all saddle\'. Oh, my po\'\r\nli\'le chile! He say, \'Pierre, I yaired say Mr. Luke William\' want his\r\nhouse pent down in Orville. I reckon I go git de job befo\' somebody\r\nelse teck it.\' I say, \'You come straight back, Placide? \'He say, \'Don\'\r\nlook fer me.\' An\' w\'en I ax \'im w\'at I goin\' tell to my li\'le chile, he\r\nsay, \'Tell Euphrasie Placide know better \'an anybody livin\' w\'at goin\'\r\nmake her happy.\' An\' he start \'way; den he come back an\' say, \'Tell\r\ndat man \'--I don\' know who he was talk\' \'bout--k tell \'im he ain\'t\r\ngoin\' learn nuttin\' to a creole.\' _Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!_ I don\' know\r\nw\'at all dat mean."\r\n\r\nHe was holding the half-fainting Euphrasie in his arms, and stroking\r\nher hair.\r\n\r\n"I always yaired say he was one no-\'count creole. I nevair want to\r\nbelieve dat."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t--don\'t say that again, papa," she whisperingly entreated,\r\nspeaking in French. "Placide has saved me!"\r\n\r\n"He has save\' you f\'om w\'at, Euphrasie?" asked her father, in dazed\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"From sin," she replied to him under her breath.\r\n\r\n"I don\' know w\'at all dat mean," the old man muttered, bewildered, as\r\nhe arose and walked out on the gallery.\r\n\r\nOffdean had taken coffee in his room, and would not wait for breakfast.\r\nWhen he went to bid Euphrasie good-by, she sat beside the table with\r\nher head bowed upon her arm.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and said good-by to her, but she did not look up.\r\n\r\n"Euphrasie," he asked eagerly, "I may come back? Say that I may--after\r\na while."\r\n\r\nShe gave him no answer, and he leaned down and pressed his cheek\r\ncaressingly and entreatingly against her soft thick hair.\r\n\r\n"May I, Euphrasie?" he begged. "So long as you do not tell me no, I\r\nshall come back, dearest one."\r\n\r\nShe still made him no reply, but she did not tell him no.\r\n\r\nSo he kissed her hand and her cheek,--what he could touch of it, that\r\npeeped out from her folded arm,--and went away.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, when Offdean passed through Natchitoches, the old town\r\nwas already ringing with the startling news that Placide had been\r\ndismissed by his _fianc\xc3\xa9e_, and the wedding was off, information which\r\nthe young creole was taking the trouble to scatter broadcast as he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN AND OUT OF OLD NATCHITOCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecisely at eight o\'clock every morning except Saturdays and Sundays,\r\nMademoiselle Suzanne St. Denys Godolph would cross the railroad trestle\r\nthat spanned Bayou Boispourri. She might have crossed in the flat which\r\nMr. Alphonse Laballi\xc3\xa8re kept for his own convenience; but the method\r\nwas slow and unreliable; so, every morning at eight, Mademoiselle St.\r\nDenys Godolph crossed the trestle.\r\n\r\nShe taught public school in a picturesque little white frame structure\r\nthat stood upon Mr. Laballi\xc3\xa8re\'s land, and hung upon the very brink of\r\nthe bayou.\r\n\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re himself was comparatively a new-comer in the parish. It was\r\nbarely six months since he decided one day to leave the sugar and rice\r\nto his brother Alc\xc3\xa9e, who had a talent for their cultivation, and to\r\ntry his hand at cotton-planting. That was why he was up in Natchitoches\r\nparish on a piece of rich, high, Cane River land, knocking into shape\r\na tumbled-down plantation that he had bought for next to nothing.\r\n\r\nHe had often during his perambulations observed the trim, graceful\r\nfigure stepping cautiously over the ties, and had sometimes shivered\r\nfor its safety. He always exchanged a greeting with the girl, and once\r\nthrew a plank over a muddy pool for her to step upon. He caught but\r\nglimpses of her features, for she wore an enormous sun-bonnet to shield\r\nher complexion, that seemed marvelously fair; while loosely--fitting\r\nleather gloves protected her hands. He knew she was the school-teacher,\r\nand also that she was the daughter of that very pig-headed old Madame\r\nSt. Denys Godolph who was hoarding her barren acres across the bayou as\r\na miser hoards gold. Starving over them, some people said. But that was\r\nnonsense; nobody starves on a Louisiana plantation, unless it be with\r\nsuicidal intent.\r\n\r\nThese things he knew, but he did not know why Mademoiselle St. Denys\r\nGodolph always answered his salutation with an air of chilling hauteur\r\nthat would easily have paralyzed a less sanguine man.\r\n\r\nThe reason was that Suzanne, like every one else, had heard the stories\r\nthat were going the rounds about him. People said he was entirely too\r\nmuch at home with the free mulattoes.[1] It seems a dreadful thing to\r\nsay, and it would be a shocking thing to think of a Laballi\xc3\xa8re; but it\r\nwas n\'t true.\r\n\r\nWhen Laballi\xc3\xa8re took possession of his land, he found the\r\nplantation-house occupied by one Giestin and his swarming family. It\r\nwas past reckoning how long the free mulatto and his people had been\r\nthere. The house was a six-room, long, shambling affair, shrinking\r\ntogether from decrepitude. There was not an entire pane of glass in the\r\nstructure; and the Turkey-red curtains flapped in and out of the broken\r\napertures. But there is no need to dwell upon details; it was wholly\r\nunfit to serve as a civilized human habitation; and Alphonse Laballi\xc3\xa8re\r\nwould no sooner have disturbed its contented occupants than he would\r\nhave scattered a family of partridges nesting in a corner of his field.\r\nHe established himself with a few belongings in the best cabin he could\r\nfind on the place, and, without further ado, proceeded to supervise the\r\nbuilding of house, of gin, of this, that, and the other, and to look\r\ninto the hundred details that go to set a neglected plantation in good\r\nworking order. He took his meals at the free mulatto\'s, quite apart\r\nfrom the family, of course; and they attended, not too skillfully, to\r\nhis few domestic wants.\r\n\r\nSome loafer whom he had snubbed remarked one day in town that\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re had more use for a free mulatto than he had for a white\r\nman. It was a sort of catching thing to say, and suggestive, and was\r\nrepeated with the inevitable embellishments.\r\n\r\nOne morning when Laballi\xc3\xa8re sat eating his solitary breakfast, and\r\nbeing waited upon by the queenly Madame Giestin and a brace of her\r\nweazened boys, Giestin himself came into the room. He was about half\r\nthe size of his wife, puny and timid. He stood beside the table,\r\ntwirling his felt hat aimlessly and balancing himself insecurely on his\r\nhigh-pointed boot-heels.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Laballi\xc3\xa8re," he said, "I reckon I tell you; it\'s betta you git\r\nshed o\' me en\' my fambly. Jis like you want, yas."\r\n\r\n"What in the name of common sense are you talking about?" asked\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re, looking up abstractedly from his New Orleans paper. Giestin\r\nwriggled uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"It \'s\'heap o\' story goin\' roun\' \'bout you, if you want b\'lieve me."\r\nAnd he snickered and looked at his wife, who thrust the end of her\r\nshawl into her mouth and walked from the room with a tread like the\r\nEmpress Eugenie\'s, in that elegant woman\'s palmiest days.\r\n\r\n"Stories!" echoed Laballi\xc3\xa8re, his face the picture of astonishment.\r\n"Who--where--what stories?"\r\n\r\n"Yon\'a in town en\' all about. It\'s heap o\' tale goin\' roun\', yas. They\r\nsay how come you mighty fon\' o\' mulatta. You done shoshiate wid de\r\nmulatta down yon\'a on de suga plantation, tell you can\'t res\' lessen\r\nit\'s mulatta roun\' you."\r\n\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re had a distressingly quick temper. His fist, which was\r\na strong one, came down upon the wobbling table with a crash that\r\nsent half of Madame Giestin\'s crockery bouncing and crashing to the\r\nfloor. He swore an oath that sent Madame Giestin and her father and\r\ngrandmother, who were all listening in the next room, into suppressed\r\nconvulsions of mirth.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ho! so I\'m not to associate with whom I please in Natchitoches\r\nparish. We\'ll see about that. Draw up your chair, Giestin. Call\r\nyour wife and your grandmother and the rest of the tribe, and we \'ll\r\nbreakfast together. By thunder! if I want to hobnob with mulattoes, or\r\nnegroes or Choctaw Indians or South Sea savages, whose business is it\r\nbut my own?"\r\n\r\n"I don\' know, me. It\'s jis like I tell you, Mr. Laballi\xc3\xa8re," and\r\nGiestin selected a huge key from an assortment that hung against the\r\nwall, and left the room.\r\n\r\nA half hour later, Laballi\xc3\xa8re had not yet recovered his senses. He\r\nappeared suddenly at the door of the schoolhouse, holding by the\r\nshoulder one of Giestin\'s boys. Mademoiselle St. Denys Godolph stood at\r\nthe opposite extremity of the room. Her sun-bonnet hung upon the wall,\r\nnow, so Laballi\xc3\xa8re could have seen how charming she was, had he not at\r\nthe moment been blinded by stupidity. Her blue eyes that were fringed\r\nwith dark lashes reflected astonishment at seeing him there. Her hair\r\nwas dark like her lashes, and waved softly about her smooth, white\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," began Laballi\xc3\xa8re at once, "I have taken the liberty of\r\nbringing a new pupil to you."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle St. Denys Godolph paled suddenly and her voice was\r\nunsteady when she replied:--\r\n\r\n"You are too considerate, Monsieur. Will you be so kine to give me the\r\nname of the scholar whom you desire to int\'oduce into this school?" She\r\nknew it as well as he.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name, youngster? Out with it!" cried Laballi\xc3\xa8re, striving\r\nto shake the little free mulatto into speech; but he stayed as dumb as\r\na mummy.\r\n\r\n"His name is Andr\xc3\xa9 Giestin. You know him. He is the son"--\r\n\r\n"Then, Monsieur," she interrupted, "permit me to remine you that you\r\nhave made a se\'ious mistake. This is not a school conducted fo\' the\r\neducation of the colored population. You will have to go elsew\'ere with\r\nyo\' prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\n"I shall leave my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 right here, Mademoiselle,\'and I trust you\'ll\r\ngive him the same kind attention you seem to accord to the others;"\r\nsaying which Laballi\xc3\xa8re bowed himself out of her presence. The little\r\nGiestin, left to his own devices, took only the time to give a quick,\r\nwary glance round the room, and the next instant he bounded through the\r\nopen door, as the nimblest of four-footed creatures might have done.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle St. Denys Godolph conducted school during the hours that\r\nremained, with a deliberate calmness that would have seemed ominous to\r\nher pupils, had they been better versed in the ways of young women.\r\nWhen the hour for dismissal came, she rapped upon the table to demand\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n"Chil\'ren," she began, assuming a resigned and dignified mien, "you all\r\nhave been witness to-day of the insult that has been offered to yo\'\r\nteacher by the person upon whose lan\' this schoolhouse stan\'s. I have\r\nnothing further to say on that subjec\'. I only shall add that to-morrow\r\nyo\' teacher shall sen\' the key of this schoolhouse, together with her\r\nresignation, to the gentlemen who compose the school-boa\'d." There\r\nfollowed visible disturbance among the young people.\r\n\r\n"I ketch that li\'le m\'latta, I make \'im see sight\', yas," screamed one.\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the kine, Mathurin, you mus\' take no such step, if only out\r\nof consideration fo\' my wishes. The person who has offered the affront\r\nI consider beneath my notice. Andr\xc3\xa9, on the other han\', is a chile of\r\ngood impulse, an\' by no means to blame. As you all perceive, he has\r\nshown mo\' taste and judgment than those above him, f\'om whom we might\r\nhave espected good breeding, at least."\r\n\r\nShe kissed them all, the little boys and the little girls, and\r\nhad a kind word for each. "_Et toi, mon petit Numa, j\'esp\xc3\xa8re q\'un\r\nautre_"--She could not finish the sentence, for little Numa, her\r\nfavorite, to whom she had never been able to impart the first word\r\nof English, was blubbering at a turn of affairs which he had only\r\nmiserably guessed at.\r\n\r\nShe locked the schoolhouse door and walked away towards the bridge. By\r\nthe time she reached it, the little \'Cadians had already disappeared\r\nlike rabbits, down the road and through and over the fences.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle St. Denys Godolph did not cross the trestle the following\r\nday, nor the next nor the next. Laballi\xc3\xa8re watched for her; for his\r\nbig heart was already sore and filled with shame. But more, it stung\r\nhim with remorse to realize that he had been the stupid instrument in\r\ntaking the bread, as it were, from the mouth of Mademoiselle St. Denys\r\nGodolph.\r\n\r\nHe recalled how unflinchingly and haughtily her blue eyes had\r\nchallenged his own. Her sweetness and charm came back to him and he\r\ndwelt upon them and exaggerated them, till no Venus, so far unearthed,\r\ncould in any way approach Mademoiselle St. Denys Godolph. He would have\r\nliked to exterminate the Giestin family, from the great-grandmother\r\ndown to the babe unborn.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Giesten suspected this unfavorable attitude, for one morning he\r\npiled his whole family and all his effects into wagons, and went away;\r\nover into that part of the parish known as _l\'Isle des Mul\xc3\xa2tres_.\r\n\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re\'s really chivalrous nature told him, beside, that he owed\r\nan apology, at least, to the young lady who had taken his whim so\r\nseriously. So he crossed the bayou one day and penetrated into the\r\nwilds where Madame St. Denys Godolph ruled.\r\n\r\nAn alluring little romance formed in his mind as he went; he fancied\r\nhow easily it might follow the apology. He was almost in love with\r\nMademoiselle St. Denys Godolph when he quitted his plantation. By the\r\ntime he had reached hers, he was wholly so.\r\n\r\nHe was met by Madame mere, a sweet-eyed, faded woman, upon whom old age\r\nhad fallen too hurriedly to completely efface all traces of youth. But\r\nthe house was old beyond question; decay had eaten slowly to the heart\r\nof it during the hours, the days, and years that it had been standing.\r\n\r\n"I have come to see your daughter, madame," began Laballi\xc3\xa8re, all too\r\nbluntly; for there is no denying he was blunt.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle St. Denys Godolph is not presently at home, sir," madame\r\nreplied. "She is at the time in New Orleans. She fills there a place of\r\nhigh trus\' an\' employment, Monsieur Laballi\xc3\xa8re."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Suzanne had ever thought of New Orleans, it was always in\r\nconnection with Hector Santien, because he was the only soul she knew\r\nwho dwelt there. He had had no share in obtaining for her the position\r\nshe had secured with one of the leading dry-goods firms; yet it was\r\nto him she addressed herself when her arrangements to leave home were\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for her train to reach the city, but crossed the river\r\nand met her at Gretna. The first thing he did was to kiss her, as he\r\nhad done eight years before when he left Natchitoches parish. An hour\r\nlater he would no more have thought of kissing Suzanne than he would\r\nhave tendered an embrace to the Empress of China. For by that time he\r\nhad realized that she was no longer twelve nor he twenty-four.\r\n\r\nShe could hardly believe the man who met her to be the Hector of\r\nold. His black hair was dashed with gray on the temples; he wore a\r\nshort, parted beard and a small moustache that curled. From the crown\r\nof his glossy silk hat down to his trimly-gaitered feet, his attire\r\nwas faultless. Suzanne knew her Natchitoches, and she had been to\r\nShreveport and even penetrated as far as Marshall, Texas, but in all\r\nher travels she had never met a man to equal Hector in the elegance of\r\nhis mien.\r\n\r\nThey entered a cab, and seemed to drive for an interminable time\r\nthrough the streets, mostly over cobble-stones that rendered\r\nconversation difficult. Nevertheless he talked incessantly, while she\r\npeered from the windows to catch what glimpses she could, through the\r\nnight, of that New Orleans of which she had heard so much. The sounds\r\nwere bewildering; so were the lights, that were uneven, too, serving to\r\nmake the patches of alternating gloom more mysterious.\r\n\r\nShe had not thought of asking him where he was taking her. And it was\r\nonly after they crossed Canal and had penetrated some distance into\r\nRoyal Street, that he told her. He was taking her to a friend of his,\r\nthe dearest little woman in town. That was Maman Chavan, who was going\r\nto board and lodge her for a ridiculously small consideration.\r\n\r\nMaman Chavan lived within comfortable walking distance of Canal\r\nStreet, on one of those narrow, intersecting streets between Royal and\r\nChartres. Her house was a tiny, single-story one, with overhanging\r\ngable, heavily shuttered door and windows and three wooden steps\r\nleading down to the banquette. A small garden flanked it on one side,\r\nquite screened from outside view by a high fence, over which appeared\r\nthe tops of orange trees and other luxuriant shrubbery.\r\n\r\nShe was waiting for them--a lovable, fresh-looking, white-haired,\r\nblack-eyed, small, fat little body, dressed all in black. She\r\nunderstood no English; which made no difference. Suzanne and Hector\r\nspoke but French to each other.\r\n\r\nHector did not tarry a moment longer than was needed to place his young\r\nfriend and charge in the older woman\'s care. He would not even stay to\r\ntake a bite of supper with them. Maman Chavan watched him as he hurried\r\ndown the steps and out into the gloom. Then she said to Suzanne: "That\r\nman is an angel, Mademoiselle, _un ange du bon Dieu_."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Women, my dear Maman Chavan, you know how it is with me in regard to\r\nwomen. I have drawn a circle round my heart, so--at pretty long range,\r\nmind you--and there is not one who gets through it, or over it or under\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"_Blagueur, va!_" laughed Maman Chavan, replenishing her glass from the\r\nbottle of sauterne.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday morning. They were breakfasting together on the pleasant\r\nside gallery that led by a single step down to the garden. Hector came\r\nevery Sunday morning, an hour or so before noon, to breakfast with\r\nthem. He always brought a bottle of sauterne, a pat\xc3\xa9, or a mess of\r\nartichokes or some tempting bit of _charcuterie_. Sometimes he had to\r\nwait till the two women returned from hearing mass at the cathedral.\r\nHe did not go to mass himself. They were both making a Novena on that\r\naccount, and had even gone to the expense of burning a round dozen of\r\ncandles before the good St. Joseph, for his conversion. When Hector\r\naccidentally discovered the fact, he offered to pay for the candles,\r\nand was distressed at not being permitted to do so.\r\n\r\nSuzanne had been in the city more than a month. It was already\r\nthe close of February, and the air was flower-scented, moist, and\r\ndeliciously mild.\r\n\r\n"As I said: women, my dear Maman Chavan"--\r\n\r\n"Let us hear no more about women!" cried Suzanne, impatiently. "_Cher\r\nMa\xc3\xaetre!_ but Hector can be tiresome when he wants. Talk, talk; to say\r\nwhat in the end?"\r\n\r\n"Quite right, my cousin; when I might have been saying how charming you\r\nare this morning. But don\'t think that I have n\'t noticed it," and he\r\nlooked at her with a deliberation that quite unsettled her. She took a\r\nletter from her pocket and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n"Here, read all the nice things mamma has to say of you, and the love\r\nmessages she sends to you." He accepted the several closely written\r\nsheets from her and began to look over them.\r\n\r\n"Ah, _la bonne tante_," he laughed, when he came to the tender\r\npassages that referred to himself. He had pushed aside the glass of\r\nwine that he had only partly filled at the beginning of breakfast and\r\nthat he had scarcely touched. Maman Chavan again replenished her own.\r\nShe also lighted a cigarette. So did Suzanne, who was learning to\r\nsmoke. Hector did not smoke; he did not use tobacco in any form, he\r\nalways said to those who offered him cigars.\r\n\r\nSuzanne rested her elbows on the table, adjusted the ruffles about her\r\nwrists, puffed awkwardly at her cigarette that kept going out, and\r\nhummed the Kyrie Eleison that she had heard so beautifully rendered\r\nan hour before at the Cathedral, while she gazed off into the green\r\ndepths of the garden. Maman Chavan slipped a little silver medal toward\r\nher, accompanying the action with a pantomime that Suzanne readily\r\nunderstood. She, in turn, secretly and adroitly transferred the medal\r\nto Hector\'s coat-pocket. He noticed the action plainly enough, but\r\npretended not to.\r\n\r\n"Natchitoches has n\'t changed," he commented. "The everlasting\r\n_can-cans!_ when will they have done with them? This is n\'t little\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse Mich\xc3\xa9, getting married! _Sapristi!_ but it makes one\r\nold! And old Papa Jean-Pierre only dead now? I thought he was out\r\nof purgatory five years ago. And who is this Laballi\xc3\xa8re? One of the\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8res of St. James?"\r\n\r\n"St. James, _mon cher_. Monsieur Alphonse Laballi\xc3\xa8re; an aristocrat\r\nfrom the \'golden coast.\' But it is a history, if you will believe me.\r\n_Figurez vouz_, Maman Chavan,--_pensez donc, mon ami_"--And with much\r\ndramatic fire, during which the cigarette went irrevocably out, she\r\nproceeded to narrate her experiences with Laballi\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" exclaimed Hector when the climax was reached; but his\r\nindignation was not so patent as she would have liked it to be.\r\n\r\n"And to think of an affront like that going unpunished!" was Maman\r\nChavan\'s more sympathetic comment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the scholars were only too ready to offer violence to poor little\r\nAndr\xc3\xa9, but that, you can understand, I would not permit. And now, here\r\nis mamma gone completely over to him; entrapped, God only knows how!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Hector, "I see he has been sending her tamales and\r\n_boudin blanc._"\r\n\r\n"_Boudin blanc_, my friend! If it were only that! But I have a stack of\r\nletters, so high,--I could show them to you,--singing of Laballi\xc3\xa8re,\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re, enough to drive one distracted. He visits her constantly.\r\nHe is a man of attainment, she says, a man of courage, a man of heart;\r\nand the best of company. He has sent her a bunch of fat robins as big\r\nas a tub"--\r\n\r\n"There is something in that--a good deal in that, mignonne," piped\r\nMaman Chavan, approvingly.\r\n\r\n"And now _boudin blanc!_ and she tells me it is the duty of a Christian\r\nto forgive. Ah, no; it\'s no use; mamma\'s ways are past finding out."\r\n\r\nSuzanne was never in Hector\'s company elsewhere than at Maman Chavan\'s.\r\nBeside the Sunday visit, he looked in upon them sometimes at dusk, to\r\nchat for a moment or two. He often treated them to theatre tickets,\r\nand even to the opera, when business was brisk. Business meant a\r\nlittle note-book that he carried in his pocket, in which he sometimes\r\ndotted down orders from the country people for wine, that he sold on\r\ncommission. The women always went together, unaccompanied by any male\r\nescort; trotting along, arm in arm, and brimming with enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThat same Sunday afternoon Hector walked with them a short distance\r\nwhen they were on their way to vespers. The three walking abreast\r\nalmost occupied the narrow width of the banquette. A gentleman who had\r\njust stepped out of the Hotel Royal stood aside to better enable them\r\nto pass. He lifted his hat to Suzanne, and cast a quick glance, that\r\npictured stupefaction and wrath, upon Hector.\r\n\r\n"It\'s he!" exclaimed the girl, melodramatically seizing Maman Chavan\'s\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"Who, he?"\r\n\r\n"Laballi\xc3\xa8re!"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Yes!"\r\n\r\n"A handsome fellow, all the same," nodded the little lady, approvingly.\r\nHector thought so too. The conversation again turned upon Laballi\xc3\xa8re,\r\nand so continued till they reached the side door of the cathedral,\r\nwhere the young man left his two companions.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Laballi\xc3\xa8re called upon Suzanne. Maman Chavan closed the\r\nfront door carefully after he entered the small parlor, and opened the\r\nside one that looked into the privacy of the garden. Then she lighted\r\nthe lamp and retired, just as Suzanne entered.\r\n\r\nThe girl bowed a little stiffly, if it may be said that she did\r\nanything stiffly. "Monsieur Laballi\xc3\xa8re." That was all she said.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle St. Denys Godolph," and that was all he said. But\r\nceremony did not sit easily upon him.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," he began, as soon as seated, "I am here as the bearer\r\nof a message from your mother. You must understand that otherwise I\r\nwould not be here."\r\n\r\n"I do understan\', sir, that you an\' maman have become very warm frien\'s\r\nduring my absence," she returned, in measured, conventional tones.\r\n\r\n"It pleases me immensely to hear that from you," he responded, warmly;\r\n"to believe that Madame St. Denys Godolph is my friend."\r\n\r\nSuzanne coughed more affectedly than was quite nice, and patted her\r\nglossy braids. "The message, if you please, Mr. Laballi\xc3\xa8re."\r\n\r\n"To be sure," pulling himself together from the momentary abstraction\r\ninto which he had fallen in contemplating her. "Well, it\'s just this;\r\nyour mother, you must know, has been good enough to sell me a fine bit\r\nof land--a deep strip along the bayou"--\r\n\r\n"Impossible! _Mais_, w\'at sorcery did you use to obtain such a thing of\r\nmy mother, Mr. Laballi\xc3\xa8re? Lan\' that has been in the St. Denys Godolph\r\nfamily since time untole!"\r\n\r\n"No sorcery whatever, Mademoiselle, only an appeal to your mother\'s\r\nintelligence and common sense; and she is well supplied with both. She\r\nwishes me to say, further, that she desires your presence very urgently\r\nand your immediate return home."\r\n\r\n"My mother is unduly impatient, surely," replied Suzanne, with chilling\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\n"May I ask, mademoiselle," he broke in, with an abruptness that was\r\nstartling, "the name of the man with whom you were walking this\r\nafternoon?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with unaffected astonishment, and told him: "I hardly\r\nunderstan\' yo\' question. That gentleman is Mr. Hector Santien, of\r\none of the firs\' families of Natchitoches; a warm ole frien\' an\' far\r\ndistant relative of mine."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s his name, is it, Hector Santien? Well, please don\'t walk\r\non the New Orleans streets again with Mr. Hector Santien."\r\n\r\n"Yo\' remarks would be insulting if they were not so highly amusing, Mr.\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon if I am insulting; and I have no desire to be\r\namusing," and then Laballi\xc3\xa8re lost his head. "You are at liberty to\r\nwalk the streets with whom you please, of course," he blurted, with\r\nill-suppressed passion, "but if I encounter Mr. Hector Santien in your\r\ncompany again, in public, I shall wring his neck, then and there, as\r\nI would a chicken; I shall break every bone in his body"--Suzanne had\r\narisen.\r\n\r\n"You have said enough, sir. I even desire no explanation of yo\' words."\r\n\r\n"I did n\'t intend to explain them," he retorted, stung by the\r\ninsinuation.\r\n\r\n"You will escuse me further," she requested icily, motioning to retire.\r\n\r\n"Not till--oh, not till you have forgiven me," he cried impulsively,\r\nbarring her exit; for repentance had come swiftly this time.\r\n\r\nBut she did not forgive him. "I can wait," she said. Then he stepped\r\naside and she passed by him without a second glance.\r\n\r\nShe sent word to Hector the following day to come to her. And when he\r\nwas there, in the late afternoon, they walked together to the end of\r\nthe vine-sheltered gallery,--where the air was redolent with the odor\r\nof spring blossoms.\r\n\r\n"Hector," she began, after a while, "some one has told me I should not\r\nbe seen upon the streets of New Orleans with you."\r\n\r\nHe was trimming a long rose-stem with his sharp penknife. He did not\r\nstop nor start, nor look embarrassed, nor anything of the sort.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" he said.\r\n\r\n"But, you know," she went on, "if the saints came down from heaven to\r\ntell me there was a reason for it, I could n\'t believe them."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t believe them, _ma petite Suzanne_?" He was getting all\r\nthe thorns off nicely, and stripping away the heavy lower leaves.\r\n\r\n"I want you to look me in the face, Hector, and tell me if there is any\r\nreason."\r\n\r\nHe snapped the knife-blade and replaced the knife in his pocket; then\r\nhe looked in her eyes, so unflinchingly, that she hoped and believed\r\nit presaged a confession of innocence that she would gladly have\r\naccepted. But he said indifferently: "Yes, there are reasons."\r\n\r\n"Then I say there are not," she exclaimed excitedly; "you are amusing\r\nyour-self--laughing at me, as you always do. There are no reasons that\r\nI will hear or believe. You will walk the streets with me, will you\r\nnot, Hector?" she entreated, "and go to church with me on Sunday; and,\r\nand--oh, it\'s nonsense, nonsense for you to say things like that!"\r\n\r\nHe held the rose by its long, hardy stem, and swept it lightly and\r\ncaressingly across her forehead, along her cheek, and over her pretty\r\nmouth and chin, as a lover might have done with his lips. He noticed\r\nhow the red rose left a crimson stain behind it.\r\n\r\nShe had been standing, but now she sank upon the bench that was there,\r\nand buried her face in her palms. A slight convulsive movement of the\r\nmuscles indicated a suppressed sob.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Suzanne, Suzanne, you are not going to make yourself unhappy about\r\na _bon \xc3\xa0 rien_ like me. Come, look at me; tell me that you are not." He\r\ndrew her hands down from her face; and held them a while, bidding her\r\ngood-by. His own face wore the quizzical look it often did, as if he\r\nwere laughing at her.\r\n\r\n"That work at the store is telling on your nerves, _mignonne_. Promise\r\nme that you will go back to the country. That will be best."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I am going back home, Hector."\r\n\r\n"That is right, little cousin," and he patted her hands kindly, and\r\nlaid them both down gently into her lap.\r\n\r\nHe did not return; neither during the week nor the following Sunday.\r\nThen Suzanne told Maman Chavan she was going home. The girl was not too\r\ndeeply in love with Hector: but imagination counts for something, and\r\nso does youth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLaballi\xc3\xa8re was on the train with her. She felt, somehow, that he would\r\nbe. And yet she did not dream that he had watched and waited for her\r\neach morning since he parted from her.\r\n\r\nHe went to her without preliminary of manner or speech, and held out\r\nhis hand; she extended her own unhesitatingly. She could not understand\r\nwhy, and she was a little too weary to strive to do so. It seemed as\r\nthough the sheer force of his will would carry him to the goal of his\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nHe did not weary her with attentions during the time they were\r\ntogether. He sat apart from her, conversing for the most time with\r\nfriends and acquaintances who belonged in the sugar district through\r\nwhich they traveled in the early part of the day.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why he had ever left that section to go up into\r\nNatchitoches. Then she wondered if he did not mean to speak to her at\r\nall. As if he had read the thought, he went and sat down beside her.\r\n\r\nHe showed her, away off across the country, where his mother lived, and\r\nhis brother Alc\xc3\xa9e, and his cousin Clarisse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, when Maman Chavan strove to sound the depth of\r\nHector\'s feeling for Suzanne, he told her again:\r\n\r\n"Women, my dear Maman Chavan, you know how it is with me in regard to\r\nwomen," and he refilled her glass from the bottle of sauterne.\r\n\r\n"_Farceur va!_" and Maman Chavan laughed, and her fat shoulders\r\nquivered under the white _volante_ she wore.\r\n\r\nA day or two later, Hector was walking down Canal Street at four in\r\nthe afternoon. He might have posed, as he was, for a fashion-plate.\r\nHe looked not to the right nor to the left; not even at the women who\r\npassed by. Some of them turned to look at him.\r\n\r\nWhen he approached the corner of Royal, a young man who stood there\r\nnudged his companion.\r\n\r\n"You know who that is?" he said, indicating Hector.\r\n\r\n"No; who?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you are an innocent. Why, that\'s Deroustan, the most notorious\r\ngambler in New Orleans."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A term still applied in Louisiana to mulattoes who were\r\nnever in slavery, and whose families in most instances were themselves\r\nslave owners.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SABINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sight of a human habitation, even if it was a rude log cabin with a\r\nmud chimney at one end, was a very gratifying one to Gr\xc3\xa9goire.\r\n\r\nHe had come out of Natchitoches parish, and had been riding a great\r\npart of the day through the big lonesome parish of Sabine. He was not\r\nfollowing the regular Texas road, but, led by his erratic fancy, was\r\npushing toward the Sabine River by circuitous paths through the rolling\r\npine forests.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the cabin in the clearing, he discerned behind a\r\npalisade of pine saplings an old negro man chopping wood.\r\n\r\n"Howdy, Uncle," called out the young fellow, reining his horse. The\r\nnegro looked up in blank amazement at so unexpected an apparition,\r\nbut he only answered: "How you do, suh," accompanying his speech by a\r\nseries of polite nods.\r\n\r\n"Who lives yere?"\r\n\r\n"Hit\'s Mas\' Bud Aiken w\'at live\' heah, suh."\r\n\r\n"Well, if Mr. Bud Aiken c\'n afford to hire a man to chop his wood, I\r\nreckon he won\'t grudge me a bite o\' suppa an\' a couple hours\' res\' on\r\nhis gall\'ry. W\'at you say, ole man?"\r\n\r\n"I say dit Mas\' Bud Aiken don\'t hires me to chop \'ood. Ef I don\'t chop\r\ndis heah, his wife got it to do. Dat w\'y I chops \'ood, suh. Go right\r\n\'long in, suh; you g\'me fine Mas\' Bud some\'eres roun\', ef he ain\'t\r\ndrunk an\' gone to bed."\r\n\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire, glad to stretch his legs, dismounted, and led his horse\r\ninto the small inclosure which surrounded the cabin. An unkempt,\r\nvicious-looking little Texas pony stopped nibbling the stubble there\r\nto look maliciously at him and his fine sleek horse, as they passed\r\nby. Back of the hut, and running plumb up against the pine wood, was a\r\nsmall, ragged specimen of a cotton-field.\r\n\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire was rather undersized, with a square, well-knit figure, upon\r\nwhich his clothes sat well and easily. His corduroy trousers were\r\nthrust into the legs of his boots; he wore a blue flannel shirt; his\r\ncoat was thrown across the saddle. In his keen black eyes had come a\r\npuzzled expression, and he tugged thoughtfully at the brown moustache\r\nthat lightly shaded his upper lip.\r\n\r\nHe was trying to recall when and under what circumstances he had before\r\nheard the name of Bud Aiken. But Bud Aiken himself saved Gr\xc3\xa9goire the\r\ntrouble of further speculation on the subject. He appeared suddenly in\r\nthe small doorway, which his big body quite filled; and then Gr\xc3\xa9goire\r\nremembered. This was the disreputable so-called "Texan" who a year ago\r\nhad run away with and married Baptiste Choupic\'s pretty daughter, \'Tite\r\nReine, yonder on Bayou Pierre, in Natchitoches parish. A vivid picture\r\nof the girl as he remembered her appeared to him: her trim rounded\r\nfigure; her piquant face with its saucy black coquettish eyes; her\r\nlittle exacting, imperious ways that had obtained for her the nickname\r\nof \'Tite Reine, little queen. Gr\xc3\xa9goire had known her at the \'Cadian\r\nballs that he sometimes had the hardihood to attend.\r\n\r\nThese pleasing recollections of \'Tite Reine lent a warmth that might\r\notherwise have been lacking to Gr\xc3\xa9goire\'s manner, when he greeted her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"I hope I fine you well, Mr. Aiken," he exclaimed cordially, as he\r\napproached and extended his hand.\r\n\r\n"You find me damn\' porely, suh; but you \'ve got the better o\' me, ef I\r\nmay so say."\r\n\r\nHe was a big good-looking brute, with a straw-colored "horse-shoe"\r\nmoustache quite concealing his mouth, and a several days\' growth of\r\nstubble on his rugged face. He was fond of reiterating that women\'s\r\nadmiration had wrecked his life, quite forgetting to mention the early\r\nand sustained influence of "Pike\'s Magnolia" and other brands, and\r\nwholly ignoring certain inborn propensities capable of wrecking unaided\r\nany ordinary existence. He had been lying down, and looked frouzy and\r\nhalf asleep.\r\n\r\n"Ef I may so say, you\'ve got the better o\' me, Mr.--er"--\r\n\r\n"Santien, Gr\xc3\xa9goire Santien. I have the pleasure o\' knowin\' the lady you\r\nmarried, suh; an\' I think I met you befo\',--some-w\'ere o\' \'nother,"\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire added vaguely.\r\n\r\n"Oh," drawled Aiken, waking up, "one o\' them Red River Sanchuns!" and\r\nhis face brightened at the prospect before him of enjoying the society\r\nof one of the Santien boys. "Mortimer!" he called in ringing chest\r\ntones worthy a commander at the head of his troop. The negro had\r\nrested his axe and appeared to be listening to their talk, though he\r\nwas too far to hear what they said.\r\n\r\n"Mortimer, come along here an\' take my frien\' Mr. Sanchun\'s hoss. Git\r\na move thar, git a move!" Then turning toward the entrance of the\r\ncabin he called back through the open door: "Rain!" it was his way of\r\npronouncing \'Tite Reine\'s name. "Rain!" he cried again peremptorily;\r\nand turning to Gr\xc3\xa9goire: "she\'s \'tendin\' to some or other housekeepin\'\r\ntruck." \'Tite Reine was back in the yard feeding the solitary pig which\r\nthey owned, and which Aiken had mysteriously driven up a few days\r\nbefore, saying he had bought it at Many.\r\n\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire could hear her calling out as she approached: "I\'m comin\',\r\nBud. Yere I come. W\'at you want, Bud?" breathlessly, as she appeared\r\nin the door frame and looked out upon the narrow sloping gallery where\r\nstood the two men. She seemed to Gr\xc3\xa9goire to have changed a good deal.\r\nShe was thinner, and her eyes were larger, with an alert, uneasy look\r\nin them; he fancied the startled expression came from seeing him there\r\nunexpectedly. She wore cleanly homespun garments, the same she had\r\nbrought with her from Bayou Pierre; but her shoes were in shreds. She\r\nuttered only a low, smothered exclamation when she saw Gr\xc3\xa9goire.\r\n\r\n"Well, is that all you got to say to my frien\' Mr. Sanchun? That\'s\r\nthe way with them Cajuns," Aiken offered apologetically to his guest;\r\n"ain\'t got sense enough to know a white man when they see one."\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire took her hand.\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty glad to see you, \'Tite Heine," he said from his heart.\r\nShe had for some reason been unable to speak; now she panted somewhat\r\nhysterically:--\r\n\r\n"You mus\' escuse me, Mista Gr\xc3\xa9goire. It\'s the truth I did n\' know you\r\nfirs\', stan\'in\' up there." A deep flush had supplanted the former\r\npallor of her face, and her eyes shone with tears and ill-concealed\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"I thought you all lived yonda in Grant," remarked Gr\xc3\xa9goire carelessly,\r\nmaking talk for the purpose of diverting Aiken\'s attention away from\r\nhis wife\'s evident embarrassment, which he himself was at a loss to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n"Why, we did live a right smart while in Grant; but Grant ain\'t no\r\nparish to make a livin\' in. Then I tried Winn and Caddo a spell; they\r\nwas n\'t no better. But I tell you, suh, Sabine\'s a damn\' sight worse\r\nthan any of \'em. Why, a man can\'t git a drink o\' whiskey here without\r\ngoing out of the parish fer it, or across into Texas. I\'m fixin\' to\r\nsell out an\' try Vernon."\r\n\r\nBud Aiken\'s household belongings surely would not count for much in\r\nthe contemplated "selling out." The one room that constituted his home\r\nwas extremely bare of furnishing,--a cheap bed, a pine table, and a\r\nfew chairs, that was all. On a rough shelf were some paper parcels\r\nrepresenting the larder. The mud daubing had fallen out here and there\r\nfrom between the logs of the cabin; and into the largest of these\r\napertures had been thrust pieces of ragged bagging and wisps of cotton.\r\nA tin basin outside on the gallery offered the only bathing facilities\r\nto be seen. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, Gr\xc3\xa9goire announced his\r\nintention of passing the night with Aiken.\r\n\r\n"I\'m jus\' goin\' to ask the privilege o\' layin\' down yere on yo\' gall\'ry\r\nto-night, Mr. Aiken. My hoss ain\'t in firs\'-class trim; an\' a night\'s\r\nres\' ain\'t goin\' to hurt him o\' me either." He had begun by declaring\r\nhis intention of pushing on across the Sabine, but an imploring look\r\nfrom \'Tite Reine\'s eyes had stayed the words upon his lips. Never had\r\nhe seen in a woman\'s eyes a look of such heartbroken entreaty. He\r\nresolved on the instant to know the meaning of it before setting foot\r\non Texas soil. Gr\xc3\xa9goire had never learned to steel his heart against a\r\nwoman\'s eyes, no matter what language they spoke.\r\n\r\nAn old patchwork quilt folded double and a moss pillow which \'Tite\r\nReine gave him out on the gallery made a bed that was, after all, not\r\ntoo uncomfortable for a young fellow of rugged habits.\r\n\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire slept quite soundly after he laid down upon his improvised bed\r\nat nine o\'clock. He was awakened toward the middle of the night by some\r\none gently shaking him. It was \'Tite Reine stooping over him; he could\r\nsee her plainly, for the moon was shining. She had not removed the\r\nclothing she had worn during the day; but her feet were bare and looked\r\nwonderfully small and white. He arose on his elbow, wide awake at once.\r\n"W\'y, \'Tite Reine! w\'at the devil you mean? w\'ere\'s yo\' husban\'?"\r\n\r\n"The house kin fall on \'im, \'ten goin\' wake up Bud w\'en he\'s sleepin\';\r\nhe drink\' too much." Now that she had aroused Gr\xc3\xa9goire, she stood up,\r\nand sinking her face in her bended arm like a child, began to cry\r\nsoftly. In an instant he was on his feet.\r\n\r\n"My God, \'Tite Reine! w\'at\'s the matta? you got to tell me w\'at\'s the\r\nmatta." He could no longer recognize the imperious \'Tite Reine, whose\r\nwill had been the law in her father\'s household. He led her to the edge\r\nof the low gallery and there they sat down.\r\n\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire loved women. He liked their nearness, their atmosphere; the\r\ntones of their voices and the things they said; their ways of moving\r\nand turning about; the brushing of their garments when they passed\r\nhim by pleased him. He was fleeing now from the pain that a woman had\r\ninflicted upon him. When any overpowering sorrow came to Gr\xc3\xa9goire he\r\nfelt a singular longing to cross the Sabine River and lose himself in\r\nTexas. He had done this once before when his home, the old Santien\r\nplace, had gone into the hands of creditors. The sight of \'Tite Reine\'s\r\ndistress now moved him painfully.\r\n\r\n"W\'at is it, \'Tite Reine? tell me w\'at it is," he kept asking her.\r\nShe was attempting to dry her eyes on her coarse sleeve. He drew a\r\nhandkerchief from his back pocket and dried them for her.\r\n\r\n"They all well, yonda?" she asked, haltingly, "my popa? my moma? the\r\nchil\'en?" Gr\xc3\xa9goire knew no more of the Baptiste Choupic family than the\r\npost beside him. Nevertheless he answered: "They all right well, \'Tite\r\nReine, but they mighty lonesome of you."\r\n\r\n"My popa, he got a putty good crop this yea\'?"\r\n\r\n"He made right smart o\' cotton fo\' Bayou Pierre."\r\n\r\n"He done haul it to the relroad?"\r\n\r\n"No, he ain\'t quite finish pickin\'."\r\n\r\n"I hope they all ent sole \'Putty Girl\'?" she inquired solicitously.\r\n\r\n"Well, I should say not! Yo\' pa says they ain\'t anotha piece o\'\r\nhossflesh in the pa\'ish he\'d want to swap fo\' \'Putty Girl.\'" She turned\r\nto him with vague but fleeting amazement,--"Putty Girl" was a cow!\r\n\r\nThe autumn night was heavy about them. The black forest seemed to have\r\ndrawn nearer; its shadowy depths were filled with the gruesome noises\r\nthat inhabit a southern forest at night time.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t you \'fraid sometimes yere, \'Tite Reine?" Gr\xc3\xa9goire asked, as he\r\nfelt a light shiver run through him at the weirdness of the scene.\r\n\r\n"No," she answered promptly, "I ent \'fred o\' nothin\' \'cep\' Bud."\r\n\r\n"Then he treats you mean? I thought so!"\r\n\r\n"Mista Gr\xc3\xa9goire," drawing close to him and whispering in his face,\r\n"Bud\'s killin\' me." He clasped her arm, holding her near him, while an\r\nexpression of profound pity escaped him. "Nobody don\' know, \'cep\' Unc\'\r\nMort\'mer," she went on. "I tell you, he beats me; my back an\' arms--you\r\nought to see--it\'s all blue. He would \'a\' choke\' me to death one day\r\nw\'en he was drunk, if Unc\' Mort\'mer had n\' make \'im lef go--with his\r\naxe ov\' his head." Gr\xc3\xa9goire glanced back over his shoulder toward the\r\nroom where the man lay sleeping. He was wondering if it would really be\r\na criminal act to go then and there and shoot the top of Bud Aiken\'s\r\nhead off. He himself would hardly have considered it a crime, but he\r\nwas not sure of how others might regard the act.\r\n\r\n"That\'s w\'y I wake you up, to tell you," she continued. "Then sometime\'\r\nhe plague me mos\' crazy; he tell me\'t ent no preacher, it\'s a Texas\r\ndrummer w\'at marry him an\' me; an\' w\'en I don\' know w\'at way to turn no\r\nmo\', he say no, it\'s a Meth\'dis\' archbishop, an\' keep on laughin\' \'bout\r\nme, an\' I don\' know w\'at the truth!"\r\n\r\nThen again, she told how Bud had induced her to mount the vicious\r\nlittle mustang "Buckeye," knowing that the little brute would n\'t carry\r\na woman; and how it had amused him to witness her distress and terror\r\nwhen she was thrown to the ground.\r\n\r\n"If I would know how to read an\' write, an\' had some pencil an\' paper,\r\nit\'s long \'go I would wrote to my popa. But it\'s no pos\'-office, it\'s\r\nno relroad,--nothin\' in Sabine. An\' you know, Mista Gr\xc3\xa9goire, Bud say\r\nhe\'s goin\' carry me yonda to Vernon, an\' fu\'ther off yet,--\'way yonda,\r\nan\' he\'s goin\' turn me loose. Oh, don\' leave me yere, Mista Gr\xc3\xa9goire!\r\ndon\' leave me behine you!" she entreated, breaking once more into sobs.\r\n\r\n"\'Tite Reine," he answered, "do you think I\'m such a low-down scound\'el\r\nas to leave you yere with that"--He finished the sentence mentally, not\r\nwishing to offend the ears of \'Tite Reine.\r\n\r\nThey talked on a good while after that. She would not return to the\r\nroom where her husband lay; the nearness of a friend had already\r\nemboldened her to inward revolt. Gr\xc3\xa9goire induced her to lie down and\r\nrest upon the quilt that she had given to him for a bed. She did so,\r\nand broken down by fatigue was soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHe stayed seated on the edge of the gallery and began to smoke\r\ncigarettes which he rolled himself of perique tobacco. He might have\r\ngone in and shared Bud Aiken\'s bed, but preferred to stay there near\r\n\'Tite Reine. He watched the two horses, tramping slowly about the lot,\r\ncropping the dewy wet tufts of grass.\r\n\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire smoked on. He only stopped when the moon sank down behind\r\nthe pine-trees, and the long deep shadow reached out and enveloped\r\nhim. Then he could no longer see and follow the filmy smoke from his\r\ncigarette, and he threw it away. Sleep was pressing heavily upon him.\r\nHe stretched himself full length upon the rough bare boards of the\r\ngallery and slept until day-break.\r\n\r\nBud Aiken\'s satisfaction was very genuine when he learned that Gr\xc3\xa9goire\r\nproposed spending the day and another night with him. He had already\r\nrecognized in the young creole a spirit not altogether uncongenial to\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\'Tite Reine cooked breakfast for them. She made coffee; of course there\r\nwas no milk to add to it, but there was sugar. From a meal bag that\r\nstood in the corner of the room she took a measure of meal, and with it\r\nmade a pone of corn bread. She fried slices of salt pork. Then Bud sent\r\nher into the field to pick cotton with old Uncle Mortimer. The negro\'s\r\ncabin was the counterpart of their own, but stood quite a distance away\r\nhidden in the woods. He and Aiken worked the crop on shares.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day Bud produced a grimy pack of cards from behind a\r\nparcel of sugar on the shelf. Gr\xc3\xa9goire threw the cards into the fire\r\nand replaced them with a spic and span new "deck" that he took from his\r\nsaddle-bags. He also brought forth from the same receptacle a bottle of\r\nwhiskey, which he presented to his host, saying that he himself had no\r\nfurther use for it, as he had "sworn off" since day before yesterday,\r\nwhen he had made a fool of himself in Cloutierville.\r\n\r\nThey sat at the pine table smoking and playing cards all the morning,\r\nonly desisting when \'Tite Reine came to serve them with the gumbo-fil\xc3\xa9\r\nthat she had come out of the field to cook at noon. She could afford\r\nto treat a guest to chicken gumbo, for she owned a half dozen chickens\r\nthat Uncle Mortimer had presented to her at various times. There were\r\nonly two spoons, and \'Tite Reine had to wait till the men had finished\r\nbefore eating her soup. She waited for Gr\xc3\xa9goire\'s spoon, though her\r\nhusband was the first to get through. It was a very childish whim.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she picked cotton again; and the men played cards,\r\nsmoked, and Bud drank.\r\n\r\nIt was a very long time since Bud Aiken had enjoyed himself so well,\r\nand since he had encountered so sympathetic and appreciative a listener\r\nto the story of his eventful career. The story of \'Tite Reine\'s fall\r\nfrom the horse he told with much spirit, mimicking quite skillfully\r\nthe way in which she had complained of never being permitted "to teck\r\na li\'le pleasure," whereupon he had kindly suggested horseback riding.\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire enjoyed the story amazingly, which encouraged Aiken to relate\r\nmany more of a similar character. As the afternoon wore on, all\r\nformality of address between the two had disappeared: they were "Bud"\r\nand "Gr\xc3\xa9goire" to each other, and Gr\xc3\xa9goire had delighted Aiken\'s soul\r\nby promising to spend a week with him. \'Tite Reine was also touched by\r\nthe spirit of recklessness in the air; it moved her to fry two chickens\r\nfor supper. She fried them deliciously in bacon fat. After supper she\r\nagain arranged Gr\xc3\xa9goire\'s bed out on the gallery.\r\n\r\nThe night fell calm and beautiful, with the delicious odor of the pines\r\nfloating upon the air. But the three did not sit up to enjoy it. Before\r\nthe stroke of nine, Aiken had already fallen upon his bed unconscious\r\nof everything about him in the heavy drunken sleep that would hold him\r\nfast through the night. It even clutched him more relentlessly than\r\nusual, thanks to Gr\xc3\xa9goire\'s free gift of whiskey.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high when he awoke. He lifted his voice and called\r\nimperiously for \'Tite Reine, wondering that the coffee-pot was not on\r\nthe hearth, and marveling still more that he did not hear her voice in\r\nquick response with its, "I\'m comin\', Bud. Yere I come." He called\r\nagain and again. Then he arose and looked out through the back door to\r\nsee if she were picking cotton in the field, but she was not there. He\r\ndragged himself to the front entrance. Gr\xc3\xa9goire\'s bed was still on the\r\ngallery, but the young fellow was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nUncle Mortimer had come into the yard, not to cut wood this time, but\r\nto pick up the axe which was his own property, and lift it to his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"Mortimer," called out Aiken, "whur\'s my wife?" at the same time\r\nadvancing toward the negro. Mortimer stood still, waiting for him.\r\n"Whur\'s my wife an\' that Frenchman? Speak out, I say, before I send you\r\nto h--l."\r\n\r\nUncle Mortimer never had feared Bud Aiken; and with the trusty axe upon\r\nhis shoulder, he felt a double hardihood in the man\'s presence. The old\r\nfellow passed the back of his black, knotty hand unctuously over his\r\nlips, as though he relished in advance the words that were about to\r\npass them. He spoke carefully and deliberately:\r\n\r\n"Miss Reine," he said, "I reckon she mus\' of done struck Natchitoches\r\npa\'ish sometime to\'ard de middle o\' de night, on dat \'ar swif\' hoss o\'\r\nMr. Sanchun\'s."\r\n\r\nAiken uttered a terrific oath. "Saddle up Buckeye," he yelled, "before\r\nI count twenty, or I \'ll rip the black hide off yer. Quick, thar! Thur\r\nain\'t nothin\' four-footed top o\' this earth that Buckeye can\'t run\r\ndown." Uncle Mortimer scratched his head dubiously, as he answered:--\r\n\r\n"Yas, Mas\' Bud, but you see, Mr. Sanchun, he done cross de Sabine befo\'\r\nsun-up on Buckeye."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY FINE FIDDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the half dozen little ones were hungry, old Cl\xc3\xa9ophas would take\r\nthe fiddle from its Hannel bag and play a tune upon it. Perhaps it was\r\nto drown their cries, or their hunger, or his conscience, or all three.\r\nOne day Fifine, in a rage, stamped her small foot and clinched her\r\nlittle hands, and declared:\r\n\r\n"It\'s no two way\'! I\'m goin\' smash it, dat fiddle, some day in a\r\nt\'ousan\' piece\'!"\r\n\r\n"You mus\' n\' do dat, Fifine," expostulated her father. "Dat fiddle been\r\nol\'er \'an you an\' me t\'ree time\' put togedder. You done yaird me tell\r\noften \'nough \'bout dat _Italien_ w\'at give it to me w\'en he die, \'long\r\nyonder befo\' de war. An\' he say, \'Cl\xc3\xa9ophas, dat fiddle--dat one part my\r\nlife--w\'at goin\' live w\'en I be dead--_Dieu merci!_ \'You talkin\' too\r\nfas\', Fifine."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m goin\' do some\'in\' wid dat fiddle, _va!_" returned the\r\ndaughter, only half mollified. "Mine w\'at I say."\r\n\r\nSo once when there were great carryings-on up at the big\r\nplantation--no end of ladies and gentlemen from the city,\r\nriding, driving, dancing, and making music upon all manner of\r\ninstruments--Fifine, with the fiddle in its flannel bag, stole away and\r\nup to the big house where these festivities were in progress.\r\n\r\nNo one noticed at first the little barefoot girl seated upon a step of\r\nthe veranda and watching, lynx-eyed, for her opportunity.\r\n\r\n"It\'s one fiddle I got for sell," she announced, resolutely, to the\r\nfirst who questioned her.\r\n\r\nIt was very funny to have a shabby little girl sitting there wanting to\r\nsell a fiddle, and the child was soon surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe lustreless instrument was brought forth and examined, first with\r\namusement, but soon very seriously, especially by three gentlemen: one\r\nwith very long hair that hung down, another with equally long hair that\r\nstood up, the third with no hair worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nThese three turned the fiddle upside down and almost inside out. They\r\nthumped upon it, and listened. They scraped upon it, and listened. They\r\nwalked into the house with it, and out of the house with it, and into\r\nremote corners with it. All this with much putting of heads together,\r\nand talking together in familiar and unfamiliar languages. And,\r\nfinally, they sent Fifine away with a fiddle twice as beautiful as the\r\none she had brought, and a roll of money besides!\r\n\r\nThe child was dumb with astonishment, and away she flew. But when she\r\nstopped beneath a big chinaberry-tree, to further scan the roll of\r\nmoney, her wonder was redoubled. There was far more than she could\r\ncount, more than she had ever dreamed of possessing. Certainly enough\r\nto top the old cabin with new shingles; to put shoes on all the little\r\nbare feet and food into the hungry mouths. Maybe enough--and Fifine\'s\r\nheart fairly jumped into her throat at the vision--maybe enough to buy\r\nBlanchette and her tiny calf that Unc\' Sim\xc3\xa9on wanted to sell!\r\n\r\n"It\'s jis like you say, Fifine," murmured old Cl\xc3\xa9ophas, huskily, when\r\nhe had played upon the new fiddle that night. "It\'s one fine fiddle;\r\nan\' like you say, it shine\' like satin. But some way or udder, \'t ain\'\r\nde same. Yair, Fifine, take it--put it \'side. I b\'lieve, me, I ain\'\r\ngoin\' play de fiddle no mo\'."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEYOND THE BAYOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bayou curved like a crescent around the point of land on which La\r\nFolle\'s cabin stood. Between the stream and the hut lay a big abandoned\r\nfield, where cattle were pastured when the bayou supplied them with\r\nwater enough. Through the woods that spread back into unknown regions\r\nthe woman had drawn an imaginary line, and past this circle she never\r\nstepped. This was the form of her only mania.\r\n\r\nShe was now a large, gaunt black woman, past thirty-five. Her real name\r\nwas Jacqueline, but every one on the plantation called her La Folle,\r\nbecause in childhood she had been frightened literally "out of her\r\nsenses," and had never wholly regained them.\r\n\r\nIt was when there had been skirmishing and sharpshooting all day in\r\nthe woods. Evening was near when P\'tit Ma\xc3\xaetre, black with powder and\r\ncrimson with blood, had staggered into the cabin of Jacqueline\'s\r\nmother, his pursuers close at his heels. The sight had stunned her\r\nchildish reason.\r\n\r\nShe dwelt alone in her solitary cabin, for the rest of the quarters had\r\nlong since been removed beyond her sight and knowledge. She had more\r\nphysical strength than most men, and made her patch of cotton and corn\r\nand tobacco like the best of them. But of the world beyond the bayou\r\nshe had long known nothing, save what her morbid fancy conceived.\r\n\r\nPeople at Bellissime had grown used to her and her way, and they\r\nthought nothing of it. Even when "Old Mis\'" died, they did not wonder\r\nthat La Folle had not crossed the bayou, but had stood upon her side of\r\nit, wailing and lamenting.\r\n\r\nP\'tit Ma\xc3\xaetre was now the owner of Bellissime. He was a middle-aged man,\r\nwith a family of beautiful daughters about him, and a little son whom\r\nLa Folle loved as if he had been her own. She called him Ch\xc3\xa9ri, and so\r\ndid every one else because she did.\r\n\r\nNone of the girls had ever been to her what Ch\xc3\xa9ri was. They had each\r\nand all loved to be with her, and to listen to her wondrous stories of\r\nthings that always happened "yonda, beyon\' de bayou."\r\n\r\nBut none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Ch\xc3\xa9ri did, nor\r\nrested their heads against her knee so confidingly, nor fallen asleep\r\nin her arms as he used to do. For Ch\xc3\xa9ri hardly did such things now,\r\nsince he had become the proud possessor of a gun, and had had his black\r\ncurls cut off.\r\n\r\nThat summer--the summer Ch\xc3\xa9ri gave La Folle two black curls tied with\r\na knot of red ribbon--the water ran so low in the bayou that even the\r\nlittle children at Bellissime were able to cross it on foot, and the\r\ncattle were sent to pasture down by the river. La Folle was sorry when\r\nthey were gone, for she loved these dumb companions well, and liked to\r\nfeel that they were there, and to hear them browsing by night up to her\r\nown inclosure.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday afternoon, when the fields were deserted. The men had\r\nflocked to a neighboring village to do their week\'s trading, and the\r\nwomen were occupied with household affairs,--La Folle as well as the\r\nothers. It was then she mended and washed her handful of clothes,\r\nscoured her house, and did her baking.\r\n\r\nIn this last employment she never forgot Ch\xc3\xa9ri. To-day she had\r\nfashioned croquignoles of the most fantastic and alluring shapes for\r\nhim. So when she saw the boy come trudging across the old field with\r\nhis gleaming little new rifle on his shoulder, she called out gayly to\r\nhim, "Ch\xc3\xa9ri! Ch\xc3\xa9ri!"\r\n\r\nBut Ch\xc3\xa9ri did not need the summons, for he was coming straight to her.\r\nHis pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an orange that\r\nhe had secured for her from the very fine dinner which had been given\r\nthat day up at his father\'s house.\r\n\r\nHe was a sunny-faced youngster of ten. When he had emptied his pockets,\r\nLa Folle patted his round red cheek, wiped his soiled hands on her\r\napron, and smoothed his hair. Then she watched him as, with his cakes\r\nin his hand, he crossed her strip of cotton back of the cabin, and\r\ndisappeared into the wood.\r\n\r\nHe had boasted of the things he was going to do with his gun out there.\r\n\r\n"You think they got plenty deer in the wood, La Folle?" he had\r\ninquired, with the calculating air of an experienced hunter.\r\n\r\n"_Non, non,!_" the woman laughed. "Don\'t you look fo\' no deer, Ch\xc3\xa9ri.\r\nDat\'s too big. But you bring La Folle one good fat squirrel fo\' her\r\ndinner to-morrow, an\' she goin\' be satisfi\'."\r\n\r\n"One squirrel ain\'t a bite. I \'ll bring you mo\' \'an one, La Folle," he\r\nhad boasted pompously as he went away.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman, an hour later, heard the report of the boy\'s rifle\r\nclose to the wood\'s edge, she would have thought nothing of it if a\r\nsharp cry of distress had not followed the sound.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her arms from the tub of suds in which they had been\r\nplunged, dried them upon her apron, and as quickly as her trembling\r\nlimbs would bear her, hurried to the spot whence the ominous report had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIt was as she feared. There she found Ch\xc3\xa9ri stretched upon the ground,\r\nwith his rifle beside him. He moaned piteously:--\r\n\r\n"I\'m dead, La Folle! I\'m dead! I\'m gone!"\r\n\r\n"_Non, non!_" she exclaimed resolutely, as she knelt beside him. "Put\r\nyou\' arm \'roun\' La Folle\'s nake, Ch\xc3\xa9ri. Dat\'s nuttin\'; dat goin\' be\r\nnuttin\'." She lifted him in her powerful arms.\r\n\r\nCh\xc3\xa9ri had carried his gun muzzle-downward. He had stumbled,--he did not\r\nknow how. He only knew that he had a ball lodged somewhere in his leg,\r\nand he thought that his end was at hand. Now, with his head upon the\r\nwoman\'s shoulder, he moaned and wept with pain and fright.\r\n\r\n"Oh, La Folle! La Folle! it hurt so bad! I can\' stan\' it, La Folle!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry, mon b\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9 mon b\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9, mon Ch\xc3\xa9ri!" the woman spoke soothingly\r\nas she covered the ground with long strides. "La Folle goin\' mine you;\r\nDoctor Bonfils goin\' come make _mon Ch\xc3\xa9ri_ well agin."\r\n\r\nShe had reached the abandoned field. As she crossed it with her\r\nprecious burden, she looked constantly and restlessly from side to\r\nside. A terrible fear was upon her,--the fear of the world beyond the\r\nbayou, the morbid and insane dread she had been under since childhood.\r\n\r\nWhen she was at the bayou\'s edge she stood there, and shouted for help\r\nas if a life depended upon it:--\r\n\r\n"Oh, P\'tit Ma\xc3\xaetre! P\'tit Ma\xc3\xaetre! Venez done! Au secours! Au secours!"\r\n\r\nNo voice responded. Ch\xc3\xa9ri\'s hot tears were scalding her neck. She\r\ncalled for each and every one upon the place, and still no answer came.\r\n\r\nShe shouted, she wailed; but whether her voice remained unheard or\r\nunheeded, no reply came to her frenzied cries. And all the while Ch\xc3\xa9ri\r\nmoaned and wept and entreated to be taken home to his mother.\r\n\r\nLa Folle gave a last despairing look around her. Extreme terror was\r\nupon her. She clasped the child close against her breast, where he\r\ncould feel her heart beat like a muffled hammer. Then shutting her\r\neyes, she ran suddenly down the shallow bank of the bayou, and never\r\nstopped till she had climbed the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nShe stood there quivering an instant as she opened her eyes. Then she\r\nplunged into the footpath through the trees.\r\n\r\nShe spoke no more to Ch\xc3\xa9ri, but muttered constantly, "Bon Dieu, ayez\r\npiti\xc3\xa9 La Folle! Bon Dieu, ayez piti\xc3\xa9 moi!"\r\n\r\nInstinct seemed to guide her. When the pathway spread clear and smooth\r\nenough before her, she again closed her eyes tightly against the sight\r\nof that unknown and terrifying world.\r\n\r\nA child, playing in some weeds, caught sight of her as she neared the\r\nquarters. The little one uttered a cry of dismay.\r\n\r\n"La Folle!" she screamed, in her piercing treble. "La Folle done cross\r\nde bayer!"\r\n\r\nQuickly the cry passed down the line of cabins.\r\n\r\n"Yonda, La Folle done cross de bayou!"\r\n\r\nChildren, old men, old women, young ones with infants in their arms,\r\nflocked to doors and windows to see this awe-inspiring spectacle. Most\r\nof them shuddered with superstitious dread of what it might portend.\r\n\r\n"She totin\' Ch\xc3\xa9ri!" some of them shouted.\r\n\r\nSome of the more daring gathered about her, and followed at her heels,\r\nonly to fall back with new terror when she turned her distorted face\r\nupon them. Her eyes were bloodshot and the saliva had gathered in a\r\nwhite foam on her black lips.\r\n\r\nSome one had run ahead of her to where P\'tit Ma\xc3\xaetre sat with his family\r\nand guests upon the gallery.\r\n\r\n"P\'tit Ma\xc3\xaetre! La Folle done cross de bayou! Look her! Look her yonda\r\ntotin\' Ch\xc3\xa9ri!" This startling intimation was the first which they had\r\nof the woman\'s approach.\r\n\r\nShe was now near at hand. She walked with long strides. Her eyes were\r\nfixed desperately before her, and she breathed heavily, as a tired ox.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairway, which she could not have mounted, she laid\r\nthe boy in his father\'s arms. Then the world that had looked red to\r\nLa Folle suddenly turned black,--like that day she had seen powder and\r\nblood.--\r\n\r\nShe reeled for an instant. Before a sustaining arm could reach her, she\r\nfell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen La Folle regained consciousness, she was at home again, in her\r\nown cabin and upon her own bed. The moon rays, streaming in through\r\nthe open door and windows, gave what light was needed to the old black\r\nmammy who stood at the table concocting a tisane of fragrant herbs. It\r\nwas very late.\r\n\r\nOthers who had come, and found that the stupor clung to her, had gone\r\nagain. P\'tit Ma\xc3\xaetre had been there, and with him Doctor Bonfils, who\r\nsaid that La Folle might die.\r\n\r\nBut death had passed her by. The voice was very clear and steady with\r\nwhich she spoke to Tante Lizette, brewing her tisane there in a corner.\r\n\r\n"Ef you will give me one good drink tisane, Tante Lizette, I b\'lieve\r\nI\'m goin\' sleep, me."\r\n\r\nAnd she did sleep; so soundly, so healthfully, that old Lizette without\r\ncompunction stole softly away, to creep back through the moonlit\r\nfields to her own cabin in the new quarters.\r\n\r\nThe first touch of the cool gray morning awoke La Folle. She arose,\r\ncalmly, as if no tempest had shaken and threatened her existence but\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nShe donned her new blue cottonade and white apron, for she remembered\r\nthat this was Sunday. When she had made for herself a cup of strong\r\nblack coffee, and drunk it with relish, she quitted the cabin and\r\nwalked across the old familiar field to the bayou\'s edge again.\r\n\r\nShe did not stop there as she had always done before, but crossed with\r\na long, steady stride as if she had done this all her life.\r\n\r\nWhen she had made her way through the brush and scrub cottonwood-trees\r\nthat lined the opposite bank, she found herself upon the border of a\r\nfield where the white, bursting cotton, with the dew upon it, gleamed\r\nfor acres and acres like frosted silver in the early dawn.\r\n\r\nLa Folle drew a long, deep breath as she gazed across the country. She\r\nwalked slowly and uncertainly, like one who hardly knows how, looking\r\nabout her as she went.\r\n\r\nThe cabins, that yesterday had sent a clamor of voices to pursue her,\r\nwere quiet now. No one was yet astir at Bellissime. Only the birds that\r\ndarted here and there from hedges were awake, and singing their matins.\r\n\r\nWhen La Folle came to the broad stretch of velvety lawn that surrounded\r\nthe house, she moved slowly and with delight over the springy turf,\r\nthat was delicious beneath her tread.\r\n\r\nShe stopped to find whence came those perfumes that were assailing her\r\nsenses with memories from a time far gone.\r\n\r\nThere they were, stealing up to her from the thousand blue violets that\r\npeeped out from green, luxuriant beds. There they were, showering down\r\nfrom the big waxen bells of the magnolias far above her head, and from\r\nthe jessamine clumps around her.\r\n\r\nThere were roses, too, without number. To right and left palms spread\r\nin broad and graceful curves. It all looked like enchantment beneath\r\nthe sparkling sheen of dew.\r\n\r\nWhen La Folle had slowly and cautiously mounted the many steps that led\r\nup to the veranda, she turned to look back at the perilous ascent she\r\nhad made. Then she caught sight of the river, bending like a silver\r\nbow at the foot of Bellissime. Exultation possessed her soul.\r\n\r\nLa Folle rapped softly upon a door near at hand. Ch\xc3\xa9ri\'s mother\r\nsoon cautiously opened it. Quickly and cleverly she dissembled the\r\nastonishment she felt at seeing La Folle.\r\n\r\n"Ah, La Folle! Is it you, so early?"\r\n\r\n"_Oui_, madame. I come ax how my po\' li\'le Ch\xc3\xa9ri to, \'s mo\'nin\'."\r\n\r\n"He is feeling easier, thank you, La Folle. Dr. Bonfils says it will be\r\nnothing serious. He\'s sleeping now. Will you come back when he awakes?"\r\n\r\n"_Non_, madame. I\'m goin\' wait yair tell Ch\xc3\xa9ri wake up." La Folle\r\nseated herself upon the topmost step of the veranda.\r\n\r\nA look of wonder and deep content crept into her face as she watched\r\nfor the first time the sun rise upon the new, the beautiful world\r\nbeyond the bayou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD AUNT PEGGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the war was over, old Aunt Peggy went to Monsieur, and said:--\r\n\r\n"Massa, I ain\'t never gwine to quit yer. I\'m gittin\' ole an\' feeble,\r\nan\' my days is few in dis heah lan\' o\' sorrow an\' sin. All I axes is a\r\nli\'le co\'ner whar I kin set down an\' wait peaceful fu de en\'."\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame were very much touched at this mark of affection\r\nand fidelity from Aunt Peggy. So, in the general reconstruction of the\r\nplantation which immediately followed the surrender, a nice cabin,\r\npleasantly appointed, was set apart for the old woman. Madame did not\r\neven forget the very comfortable rocking-chair in which Aunt Peggy\r\nmight "set down," as she herself feelingly expressed it, "an\' wait fu\r\nde en\'."\r\n\r\nShe has been rocking ever since.\r\n\r\nAt intervals of about two years Aunt Peggy hobbles up to the house, and\r\ndelivers the stereotyped address which has become more than familiar:--\r\n\r\n"Mist\'ess, I\'s come to take a las\' look at you all. Le\' me look at\r\nyou good. Le\' me look at de chillun,--de big chillun an\' de li\'le\r\nchillun. Le\' me look at de picters an\' de photygraphts an\' de pianny,\r\nan\' eve\'ything \'fo\' it\'s too late. One eye is done gone, an\' de udder\'s\r\na-gwine fas\'. Any mo\'nin\' yo\' po\' ole Aunt Peggy gwine wake up an\' fin\'\r\nherse\'f stone-bline."\r\n\r\nAfter such a visit Aunt Peggy invariably returns to her cabin with a\r\ngenerously filled apron.\r\n\r\nThe scruple which Monsieur one time felt in supporting a woman for so\r\nmany years in idleness has entirely disappeared. Of late his attitude\r\ntowards Aunt Peggy is simply one of profound astonishment,--wonder at\r\nthe surprising age which an old black woman may attain when she sets\r\nher mind to it, for Aunt Peggy is a hundred and twenty-five, so she\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nIt may not be true, however. Possibly she is older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF ALCIBIADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Fred Bartner was sorely perplexed and annoyed to find that a wheel\r\nand tire of his buggy threatened to part company.\r\n\r\n"Ef you want," said the negro boy who drove him, "we kin stop yonda at\r\nole M\'si\xc3\xa9 Jean Ba\'s an\' fix it; he got de bes\' black-smif shop in de\r\npa\'ish on his place."\r\n\r\n"Who in the world is old Monsieur Jean Ba," the young man inquired.\r\n\r\n"How come, suh, you don\' know old M\'si\xc3\xa9 Jean Baptiste Plochel? He ole,\r\nole. He sorter quare in he head ev\' sence his son M\'si\xc3\xa9 Alcibiade got\r\nkill\' in de wah. Yonda he live\'; whar you sees dat che\'okee hedge\r\ntakin\' up half de road."\r\n\r\nLittle more than twelve years ago, before the "Texas and Pacific" had\r\njoined the cities of New Orleans and Shreveport with its steel bands,\r\nit was a common thing to travel through miles of central Louisiana in\r\na buggy. Fred Bartner, a young commission merchant of New Orleans,\r\non business bent, had made the trip in this way by easy stages from\r\nhis home to a point on Cane River, within a half day\'s journey of\r\nNatchitoches. From the mouth of Cane River he had passed one plantation\r\nafter another,--large ones and small ones. There was nowhere sight\r\nof anything like a town, except the little hamlet of Cloutierville,\r\nthrough which they had sped in the gray dawn. "Dat town, hit\'s ole,\r\nole; mos\' a hund\'ed year\' ole, dey say. Uh, uh, look to me like it heap\r\nol\'r an\' dat," the darkey had commented. Now they were within sight of\r\nMonsieur Jean Ba\'s towering Cherokee hedge.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas morning, but the sun was warm and the air so soft and\r\nmild that Bartner found the most comfortable way to wear his light\r\novercoat was across his knees. At the entrance to the plantation he\r\ndismounted and the negro drove away toward the smithy which stood on\r\nthe edge of the field.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the long avenue of magnolias that led to it, the house\r\nwhich confronted Bartner looked grotesquely long in comparison with its\r\nheight. It was one story, of pale, yellow stucco; its massive wooden\r\nshutters were a faded green. A wide gallery, topped by the overhanging\r\nroof, encircled it.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the stairs a very old man stood. His figure was small\r\nand shrunken, his hair long and snow-white. He wore a broad, soft\r\nfelt hat, and a brown plaid shawl across his bent shoulders. A tall,\r\ngraceful girl stood beside him; she was clad in a warm-colored blue\r\nstuff gown. She seemed to be expostulating with the old gentleman,\r\nwho evidently wanted to descend the stairs to meet the approaching\r\nvisitor. Before Bartner had had time to do more than lift his hat,\r\nMonsieur Jean Ba had thrown his trembling arms about the young man and\r\nwas exclaiming in his quavering old tones: "\xc3\x80 la fin! mon fils! \xc3\xa0 la\r\nfin!" Tears started to the girl\'s eyes and she was rosy with confusion.\r\n"Oh, escuse him, sir; please escuse him," she whisperingly entreated,\r\ngently striving to disengage the old gentleman\'s arms from around\r\nthe astonished Bartner. But a new line of thought seemed fortunately\r\nto take possession of Monsieur Jean Ba, for he moved away and went\r\nquickly, pattering like a baby, down the gallery. His fleecy white hair\r\nstreamed out on the soft breeze, and his brown shawl flapped as he\r\nturned the corner.\r\n\r\nBartner, left alone with the girl, proceeded to introduce himself and\r\nto explain his presence there.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Mr. Fred Bartna of New Orleans? The commission merchant!" she\r\nexclaimed, cordially extending her hand. "So well known in Natchitoches\r\nparish. Not _our_ merchant, Mr. Bartna," she added, naively, "but jus\'\r\nas welcome, all the same, at my gran\'father\'s."\r\n\r\nBartner felt like kissing her, but he only bowed and seated himself in\r\nthe big chair which she offered him. He wondered what was the longest\r\ntime it could take to mend a buggy tire.\r\n\r\nShe sat before him with her hands pressed down into her lap, and with\r\nan eagerness and pretty air of being confidential that were extremely\r\nengaging, explained the reasons for her grandfather\'s singular behavior.\r\n\r\nYears ago, her uncle Alcibiade, in going away to the war, with the\r\ncheerful assurance of youth, had promised his father that he would\r\nreturn to eat Christmas dinner with him. He never returned. And now, of\r\nlate years, since Monsieur Jean Ba had begun to fail in body and mind,\r\nthat old, unspoken hope of long ago had come back to live anew in his\r\nheart. Every Christmas Day he watched for the coming of Alcibiade.\r\n\r\n"Ah! if you knew, Mr. Bartna, how I have endeavor\' to distrac\' his mine\r\nfrom that thought! Weeks ago, I tole to all the negroes, big and li\'le,\r\n\'If one of you dare to say the word, Christmas gif\', in the hearing of\r\nMonsieur Jean Baptiste, you will have to answer it to me.\'"\r\n\r\nBartner could not recall when he had been so deeply interested in a\r\nnarration.\r\n\r\n"So las\' night, Mr. Bartna, I said to grandp\xc3\xa8re, \'P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa8re, you know\r\nto-morrow will be the great feas\' of la Trinit\xc3\xa9; we will read our\r\nlitany together in the morning and say a _chapelet_.\' He did not answer\r\na word; _il est malin, oui_. But this morning at day-light he was\r\nrapping his cane on the back gallery, calling together the negroes. Did\r\nthey not know it was Christmas Day, an\' a great dinner mus\' be prepare\'\r\nfor his son Alcibiade, whom he was especting!"\r\n\r\n"And so he has mistaken me for his son Alcibiade. It is very\r\nunfortunate," said Bartner, sympathetically. He was a good-looking,\r\nhonest-faced young fellow.\r\n\r\nThe girl arose, quivering with an inspiration. She approached Bartner,\r\nand in her eagerness laid her hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Bartna, if you will do me a favor! The greates\' favor of my\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\nHe expressed his absolute readiness.\r\n\r\n"Let him believe, jus\' for this one Christmas day, that you are his\r\nson. Let him have that Christmas dinner with Alcibiade, that he has\r\nbeen longing for so many year\'."\r\n\r\nBartner\'s was not a puritanical conscience, but truthfulness was a\r\nhabit as well as a principle with him, and he winced. "It seems to me\r\nit would be cruel to deceive him; it would not be"--he did not like to\r\nsay "right," but she guessed that he meant it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, for that," she laughed, "you may stay as w\'ite as snow, Mr.\r\nBartna. _I_ will take all the sin on my conscience. I assume all the\r\nresponsibility on my shoulder\'."\r\n\r\n"Esm\xc3\xa9e!" the old man was calling as he came trotting back, "Esm\xc3\xa9e, my\r\nchild," in his quavering French, "I have ordered the dinner. Go see to\r\nthe arrangements of the table, and have everything faultless."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dining-room was at the end of the house, with windows opening upon\r\nthe side and back galleries. There was a high, simply carved wooden\r\nmantelpiece, bearing a wide, slanting, old-fashioned mirror that\r\nreflected the table and its occupants. The table was laden with an\r\noverabundance. Monsieur Jean Ba sat at one end, Esm\xc3\xa9e at the other, and\r\nBartner at the side.\r\n\r\nTwo "_grif_" boys, a big black woman and a little mulatto girl waited\r\nupon them; there was a reserve force outside within easy call, and\r\nthe little black and yellow faces kept bobbing up constantly above\r\nthe window-sills. Windows and doors were open, and a fire of hickory\r\nbranches blazed on the hearth.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Jean Ba ate little, but that little greedily and rapidly; then\r\nhe stayed in rapt contemplation of his guest.\r\n\r\n"You will notice, Alcibiade, the flavor of the turkey," he said. "It is\r\ndressed with pecans; those big ones from the tree down on the bayou. I\r\nhad them gathered expressly." The delicate and rich flavor of the nut\r\nwas indeed very perceptible.\r\n\r\nBartner had a stupid impression of acting on the stage, and had to pull\r\nhimself together every now and then to throw off the stiffness of the\r\namateur actor. But this discomposure amounted almost to paralysis when\r\nhe found Mademoiselle Esm\xc3\xa9e taking the situation as seriously as her\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_ uncle Alcibiade, you are not eating! _Mais_ w\'ere have you\r\nlef\' your appetite? Corbeau, fill your young master\'s glass. Doralise,\r\nyou are neglecting Monsieur Alcibiade; he is without bread."\r\n\r\nMonsieur Jean Ba\'s feeble intelligence reached out very dimly; it\r\nwas like a dream which clothes the grotesque and unnatural with the\r\nsemblance of reality. He shook his head up and down with pleased\r\napprobation of Esm\xc3\xa9e\'s "Uncle Alcibiade," that tripped so glibly on her\r\nlips. When she arranged his after-dinner _br\xc3\xbblot_,--a lump of sugar\r\nin a flaming teaspoonful of brandy, dropped into a tiny cup of black\r\ncoffee,--he reminded her, "Your Uncle Alcibiade takes two lumps, Esm\xc3\xa9e.\r\nThe scamp! he is fond of sweets. Two or three lumps, Esm\xc3\xa9e." Bartner\r\nwould have relished his br\xc3\xbblot greatly, prepared so gracefully as it\r\nwas by Esm\xc3\xa9e\'s deft hands, had it not been for that superfluous lump.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the girl arranged her grandfather comfortably in his\r\nbig armchair on the gallery, where he loved to sit when the weather\r\npermitted. She fastened his shawl about him and laid a second one\r\nacross his knees. She shook up the pillow for his head, patted his\r\nsunken cheek and kissed his forehead under the soft-brimmed hat. She\r\nleft him there with the sun warming his feet and old shrunken knees.\r\n\r\nEsm\xc3\xa9e and Bartner walked together under the magnolias. In walking they\r\ntrod upon the violet borders that grew rank and sprawling, and the\r\nsubtle perfume of the crushed flowers scented the air deliciously. They\r\nstooped and plucked handfuls of them. They gathered roses, too, that\r\nwere blooming yet against the warm south end of the house; and they\r\nchattered and laughed like children. When they sat in the sunlight\r\nupon the low steps to arrange the flowers they had broken, Bartner\'s\r\nconscience began to prick him anew.\r\n\r\n"You know," he said, "I can\'t stay here always, as well as I should\r\nlike to. I shall have to leave presently; then your grandfather will\r\ndiscover that we have been deceiving him,--and you can see how cruel\r\nthat will be."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bartna," answered Esm\xc3\xa9e, daintily holding a rosebud up to her\r\npretty nose, "W\'en I awoke this morning an\' said my prayers, I prayed\r\nto the good God that He would give one happy Christmas day to my\r\ngran\'father. He has answered my prayer; an\' He does not sen\' his gif\'s\r\nincomplete. He will provide.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bartna, this morning I agreed to take all responsibility on my\r\nshoulder\', you remember? Now, I place all that responsibility on the\r\nshoulder\' of the blessed Virgin."\r\n\r\nBartner was distracted with admiration; whether for this beautiful and\r\nconsoling faith, or its charming votary, was not quite clear to him.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then Monsieur Jean Ba would call out, "Alcibiade, _mon\r\nfils!_" and Bartner would hasten to his side. Sometimes the old man had\r\nforgotten what he wanted to say. Once it was to ask if the salad had\r\nbeen to his liking, or if he would, perhaps, not have preferred the\r\nturkey _aux truffes_.\r\n\r\n"Alcibiade, _mon fils!_" Again Bartner amiably answered the summons.\r\nMonsieur Jean Ba took the young man\'s hand affectionately in his, but\r\nlimply, as children hold hands. Bartner\'s closed firmly around it.\r\n"Alcibiade, I am going to take a little nap now. If Robert McFarlane\r\ncomes while I am sleeping, with more talk of wanting to buy N\xc3\xa9g\r\nS\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9rin, tell him I will sell none of my slaves; not the least little\r\n_n\xc3\xa9grillon_. Drive him from the place with the shot-gun. Don\'t be\r\nafraid to use the shot-gun, Alcibiade,--when I am asleep,--if he comes."\r\n\r\nEsm\xc3\xa9e and Bartner forgot that there was such a thing as time, and that\r\nit was passing. There were no more calls of "Alcibiade, _mon fils!_" As\r\nthe sun dipped lower and lower in the west, its light was creeping,\r\ncreeping up and illuming the still body of Monsieur Jean Ba. It lighted\r\nhis waxen hands, folded so placidly in his lap; it touched his shrunken\r\nbosom. When it reached his face, another brightness had come there\r\nbefore it,--the glory of a quiet and peaceful death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBartner remained over night, of course, to add what assistance he could\r\nto that which kindly neighbors offered.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning, before taking his departure, he was permitted to\r\nsee Esm\xc3\xa9e. She was overcome with sorrow, which he could hardly hope to\r\nassuage, even with the keen sympathy which he felt.\r\n\r\n"And may I be permitted to ask, Mademoiselle, what will be your plans\r\nfor the future?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," she moaned, "I cannot any longer remain upon the ole plantation,\r\nwhich would not be home without grandp\xc3\xa8re. I suppose I shall go to live\r\nin New Orleans with my _tante_ Cl\xc3\xa9mentine." The last was spoken in the\r\ndepths of her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nBartner\'s heart bounded at this intelligence in a manner which he could\r\nnot but feel was one of unbecoming levity. He pressed her disengaged\r\nhand warmly, and went away.\r\n\r\nThe sun was again shining brightly, but the morning was crisp and\r\ncool; a thin wafer of ice covered what had yesterday been pools or\r\nwater in the road. Bartner buttoned his coat about him closely. The\r\nshrill whistles of steam cotton-gins sounded here and there. One or\r\ntwo shivering negroes were in the field gathering what shreds of\r\ncotton were left on the dry, naked stalks. The horses snorted with\r\nsatisfaction, and their strong hoof-beats rang out against the hard\r\nground.\r\n\r\n"Urge the horses," Bartner said; "they \'ve had a good rest and we want\r\nto push on to Natchitoches."\r\n\r\n"You right, suh. We done los\' a whole blesse\' day,--a plumb day."\r\n\r\n"Why, so we have," said Bartner, "I had n\'t thought of it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RUDE AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Take de do\' an\' go! You year me? Take de do\'!"\r\n\r\nLolotte\'s brown eyes flamed. Her small frame quivered. She stood with\r\nher back turned to a meagre supper-table, as if to guard it from the\r\nman who had just entered the cabin. She pointed toward the door, to\r\norder him from the house.\r\n\r\n"You mighty cross to-night, Lolotte. You mus\' got up wid de wrong foot\r\nto\'s mo\'nin\'. _Hein_, Veveste? _hein_, Jacques, w\'at you say?"\r\n\r\nThe two small urchins who sat at table giggled in sympathy with their\r\nfather\'s evident good humor.\r\n\r\n"I\'m we\' out, me!" the girl exclaimed, desperately, as she let her arms\r\nfall limp at her side. "Work, work! Fu w\'at? Fu feed de lazies\' man in\r\nNatchitoches pa\'ish."\r\n\r\n"Now, Lolotte, you think w\'at you say in\'," expostulated her father.\r\n"Sylveste Bordon don\' ax nobody to feed \'im."\r\n\r\n"W\'en you brought a poun\' of suga in de house?" his daughter retorted\r\nhotly, "or a poun\' of coffee? W\'en did you brought a piece o\' meat\r\nhome, you? An\' Nonomme all de time sick. Co\'n bread an\' po\'k, dat\'s\r\ngood fu Veveste an\' me an\' Jacques; but Nonomme? no!"\r\n\r\nShe turned as if choking, and cut into the round, soggy "pone" of corn\r\nbread which was the main feature of the scanty supper.\r\n\r\n"Po\' li\'le Nonomme; we mus\' fine some\'in\' to break dat fevah. You want\r\nto kill a chicken once a w\'ile fu Nonomme, Lolotte." He calmly seated\r\nhimself at the table.\r\n\r\n"Did n\' I done put de las\' roostah in de pot?" she cried with\r\nexasperation. "Now you come axen me fu kill de hen\'! W\'ere I goen to\r\nfine aigg\' to trade wid, w\'en de hen\' be gone? Is I got one picayune in\r\nde house fu trade wid, me?"\r\n\r\n"Papa," piped the young Jacques, "w\'at dat I yeard you drive in de\r\nyard, w\'ile go?"\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s it! W\'en Lolotte would n\' been talken\' so fas\', I could tole you\r\n\'bout dat job I got fu to-morrow. Dat was Joe Duplan\'s team of mule\'\r\nan\' wagon, wid t\'ree bale\' of cotton, w\'at you yaird. I got to go soon\r\nin de mo\'nin\' wid dat load to de landin\'. An\' a man mus\' eat w\'at got\r\nto work; dat\'s sho."\r\n\r\nLolotte\'s bare brown feet made no sound upon the rough boards as she\r\nentered the room where Nonomme lay sick and sleeping. She lifted the\r\ncoarse mosquito net from about him, sat down in the clumsy chair by the\r\nbedside, and began gently to fan the slumbering child.\r\n\r\nDusk was falling rapidly, as it does in the South. Lolotte\'s eyes grew\r\nround and big, as she watched the moon creep up from branch to branch\r\nof the moss-draped live-oak just outside her window. Presently the\r\nweary girl slept as profoundly as Nonomme. A little dog sneaked into\r\nthe room, and socially licked her bare feet. The touch, moist and warm,\r\nawakened Lolotte.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was dark and quiet. Nonomme was crying softly, because the\r\nmosquitoes were biting him. In the room beyond, old Sylveste and the\r\nothers slept. When Lolotte had quieted the child, she went outside to\r\nget a pail of cool, fresh water at the cistern. Then she crept into bed\r\nbeside Nonomme, who slept again.\r\n\r\nLolotte\'s dreams that night pictured her father returning from work,\r\nand bringing luscious oranges home in his pocket for the sick child.\r\n\r\nWhen at the very break of day she heard him astir in his room, a\r\ncertain comfort stole into her heart. She lay and listened to the faint\r\nnoises of his preparations to go out. When he had quitted the house,\r\nshe waited to hear him drive the wagon from the yard.\r\n\r\nShe waited long, but heard no sound of horse\'s tread or wagon-wheel.\r\nAnxious, she went to the cabin door and looked out. The big mules were\r\nstill where they had been fastened the night before. The wagon was\r\nthere, too.\r\n\r\nHer heart sank. She looked quickly along the low rafters supporting the\r\nroof of the narrow porch to where her father\'s fishing pole and pail\r\nalways hung. Both were gone.\r\n\r\n"\'T ain\' no use, \'t ain\' no use," she said, as she turned into the\r\nhouse with a look of something like anguish in her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the spare breakfast was eaten and the dishes cleared away, Lolotte\r\nturned with resolute mien to the two little brothers.\r\n\r\n"Veveste," she said to the older, "go see if dey got co\'n in dat wagon\r\nfu feed deni mule\'."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dey got co\'n. Papa done feed \'em, fur I see de co\'n-cob in de\r\ntrough, me."\r\n\r\n"Den you goen he\'p me hitch dem mule, to de wagon. Jacques, go down de\r\nlane an\' ax Aunt Minty if she come set wid Nonomme w\'ile I go drive dem\r\nmule\' to de landin\'."\r\n\r\nLolotte had evidently determined to undertake her father\'s work.\r\nNothing could dissuade her; neither the children\'s astonishment nor\r\nAunt Minty\'s scathing disapproval. The fat black negress came laboring\r\ninto the yard just as Lolotte mounted upon the wagon.\r\n\r\n"Git down f\'om dah, chile! Is you plumb crazy?" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t crazy; I\'m hungry, Aunt Minty. We all hungry. Somebody got\r\nfur work in dis fam\'ly."\r\n\r\n"Dat ain\'t no work fur a gal w\'at ain\'t bar\' seventeen year ole;\r\ndrivin\' Marse Duplan\'s mules! W\'at I gwine tell yo\' pa?"\r\n\r\n"Fu me, you kin tell \'im w\'at you want. But you watch Nonomme. I done\r\ncook his rice an\' set it \'side."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you bodda," replied Aunt Minty; "I got somepin heah fur my boy.\r\nI gwine \'ten\' to him."\r\n\r\nLolotte had seen Aunt Minty put something out of sight when she came\r\nup, and made her produce it. It was a heavy fowl.\r\n\r\n"Sence w\'en you start raisin\' Brahma chicken\', you?" Lolotte asked\r\nmistrustfully.\r\n\r\n"My, but you is a cu\'ious somebody! Ev\'ything w\'at got fedders on its\r\nlaigs is Brahma chicken wid you. Dis heah ole hen"--\r\n\r\n"All de same, you don\'t got fur give dat chicken to eat to Nonomme. You\r\ndon\'t got fur cook \'im in my house."\r\n\r\nAunt Minty, unheeding, turned to the house with blustering inquiry for\r\nher boy, while Lolotte drove away with great clatter.\r\n\r\nShe knew, notwithstanding her injunction, that the chicken would be\r\ncooked and eaten. Maybe she herself would partake of it when she came\r\nback, if hunger drove her too sharply.\r\n\r\n"Nax\' thing I\'m goen be one rogue," she muttered; and the tears\r\ngathered and fell one by one upon her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"It _do_ look like one Brahma, Aunt Mint," remarked the small and\r\nweazened Jacques, as he watched the woman picking the lusty fowl.\r\n\r\n"How ole is you?" was her quiet retort.\r\n\r\n"I don\' know, me."\r\n\r\n"Den if you don\'t know dat much, you betta keep yo\' mouf shet, boy."\r\n\r\nThen silence fell, but for a monotonous chant which the woman droned as\r\nshe worked. Jacques opened his lips once more.\r\n\r\n"It _do_ look like one o\' Ma\'me Duplan\' Brahma, Aunt Mint."\r\n\r\n"Yonda, whar I come f\'om, befo\' de wah"--\r\n\r\n"Ole Kaintuck, Aunt Mint?"\r\n\r\n"Ole Kaintuck."\r\n\r\n"Dat ain\'t one country like dis yere, Aunt Mint?"\r\n\r\n"You mighty right, chile, dat ain\'t no sech kentry as dis heah. Yonda,\r\nin Kaintuck, w\'en boys says de word \'Brahma chicken,\' we takes an\'\r\ngags \'em, an\' ties dar han\'s behines \'em, an\' fo\'ces \'em ter stan\' up\r\nwatchin\' folks settin\' down eatin\' chicken soup."\r\n\r\nJacques passed the back of his hand across his mouth; but lest the act\r\nshould not place sufficient seal upon it; he prudently stole away to\r\ngo and sit beside Nonomme, and wait there as patiently as he could the\r\ncoming feast.\r\n\r\nAnd what a treat it was! The luscious soup,--a great pot of it,--golden\r\nyellow, thickened with the flaky rice that Lolotte had set carefully\r\non the shelf. Each mouthful of it seemed to carry fresh blood into the\r\nveins and a new brightness into the eyes of the hungry children who ate\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nAnd that was not all. The day brought abundance with it. Their father\r\ncame home with glistening perch and trout that Aunt Minty broiled\r\ndeliciously over glowing embers, and basted with the rich chicken fat.\r\n\r\n"You see," explained old Sylveste, "w\'en I git up to \'s mo\'nin\' an\'\r\nsee it was cloudy, I say to me, \'Sylveste, w\'en you go wid dat cotton,\r\nrememba you got no tarpaulin. Maybe it rain, an\' de cotton was spoil.\r\nBetta you go yonda to Lafirme Lake, w\'ere de trout was bitin\' fas\'er\r\n\'an mosquito, an\' so you git a good mess fur de chil\'en.\' Lolotte\r\n--w\'at she goen do yonda? You ought stop Lolotte, Aunt Minty, w\'en you\r\nsee w\'at she was want to do."\r\n\r\n"Did n\' I try to stop \'er? Did n\' I ax \'er, \'W\'at I gwine tell yo\'\r\npa?\' An\' she \'low, \'Tell \'im to go hang hisse\'f, de triflind ole\r\nrapscallion! I\'s de one w\'at\'s runnin\' dis heah fambly!\'"\r\n\r\n"Dat don\' soun\' like Lolotte, Aunt Minty; you mus\' yaird \'er crooked;\r\n_hein_, Nonomme?"\r\n\r\nThe quizzical look in his good-natured features was irresistible.\r\nNonomme fairly shook with merriment.\r\n\r\n"My head feel so good," he declared. "I wish Lolotte would come, so I\r\ncould tole \'er." And he turned in his bed to look down the long, dusty\r\nlane, with the hope of seeing her appear as he had watched her go,\r\nsitting on one of the cotton bales and guiding the mules.\r\n\r\nBut no one came all through the hot morning. Only at noon a\r\nbroad-shouldered young negro appeared in view riding through the dust.\r\nWhen he had dismounted at the cabin door, he stood leaning a shoulder\r\nlazily against the jamb.\r\n\r\n"Well, heah you is," he grumbled, addressing Sylveste with no mark of\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n"Heah you is, settin\' down like comp\'ny, an\' Marse Joe yonda sont me\r\nsee if you was dead."\r\n\r\n"Joe Duplan boun\' to have his joke, him," said Sylveste, smiling\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n"Maybe it look like a joke to you, but \'t aint no joke to him, man, to\r\nhave one o\' his wagons smoshed to kindlin\', an\' his bes\' team tearin\'\r\nt\'rough de country. You don\'t want to let \'im lay ban\'s on you, joke o\'\r\nno joke."\r\n\r\n"_Mal\xc3\xa9diction!_" howled Sylveste, as he staggered to his feet. He stood\r\nfor one instant irresolute; then he lurched past the man and ran wildly\r\ndown the lane. He might have taken the horse that was there, but he\r\nwent tottering on afoot, a frightened look in his eyes, as if his soul\r\ngazed upon an inward picture that was horrible.\r\n\r\nThe road to the landing was little used. As Sylveste went he could\r\nreadily trace the marks of Lolotte\'s wagon-wheels. For some distance\r\nthey went straight along the road. Then they made a track as if a\r\nmadman had directed their course, over stump and hillock, tearing the\r\nbushes and barking the trees on either side.\r\n\r\nAt each new turn Sylveste expected to find Lolotte stretched senseless\r\nupon the ground, but, there was never a sign of her.\r\n\r\nAt last he reached the landing, which was a dreary spot, slanting down\r\nto the river and partly cleared to afford room for what desultory\r\nfreight might be left there from time to time. There were the\r\nwagon-tracks, clean down to the river\'s edge and partly in the water,\r\nwhere they made a sharp and senseless turn. But Sylveste found no trace\r\nof his girl.\r\n\r\n"Lolotte!" the old man cried out into the stillness. "Lolotte, _ma\r\nfille_, Lolotte!" But no answer came; no sound but the echo of his own\r\nvoice, and the soft splash of the red water that lapped his feet.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at it, sick with anguish and apprehension.\r\n\r\nLolotte had disappeared as completely as if the earth had opened and\r\nswallowed her. After a few days it became the common belief that\r\nthe girl had been drowned. It was thought that she must have been\r\nhurled from the wagon into the water during the sharp turn that the\r\nwheel-tracks indicated, and carried away by the rapid current.\r\n\r\nDuring the days of search, old Sylveste\'s excitement kept him up. When\r\nit was over, an apathetic despair seemed to settle upon him.\r\n\r\nMadame Duplan, moved by sympathy, had taken the little four-year-old\r\nNonomme to the plantation Les Ch\xc3\xaaniers, where the child was awed by the\r\nbeauty and comfort of things that surrounded him there. He thought\r\nalways that Lolotte would come back, and watched for her every day; for\r\nthey did not tell him the sad tidings of her loss.\r\n\r\nThe other two boys were placed in the temporary care of Aunt Minty;\r\nand old Sylveste roamed like a persecuted being through the country.\r\nHe who had been a type of indolent content and repose had changed to a\r\nrestless spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen he thought to eat, it was in some humble negro cabin that he\r\nstopped to ask for food, which was never denied him. His grief had\r\nclothed him with a dignity that imposed respect.\r\n\r\nOne morning very early he appeared before the planter with a disheveled\r\nand hunted look.\r\n\r\n"M\'sieur Duplan," he said, holding his hat in his hand and looking away\r\ninto vacancy, "I been try ev\'thing. I been try settin\' down still on de\r\nsto\' gall\'ry. I been walk, I been run; \'t ain\' no use. Dey got al\'ays\r\nsome\'in\' w\'at push me. I go fishin\', an\' it\'s some\'in\' w\'at push me\r\nworser \'an ever. By gracious! M\'sieur Duplan, gi\' me some work!"\r\n\r\nThe planter gave him at once a plow in hand, and no plow on the whole\r\nplantation dug so deep as that one, nor so fast. Sylveste was the first\r\nin the field, as he was the last one there. From dawn to nightfall he\r\nworked, and after, till his limbs refused to do his bidding.\r\n\r\nPeople came to wonder, and the negroes began to whisper hints of\r\ndemoniacal possession.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Duplan gave careful thought to the subject of Lolotte\'s\r\nmysterious disappearance, an idea came to him. But so fearful was he\r\nto arouse false hopes in the breasts of those who grieved for the girl\r\nthat to no one did he impart his suspicions save to his wife. It was\r\non the eve of a business trip to New Orleans that he told her what he\r\nthought, or what he hoped rather.\r\n\r\nUpon his return, which happened not many days later, he went out to\r\nwhere old Sylveste was toiling in the field with frenzied energy.\r\n\r\n"Sylveste," said the planter, quietly, when he had stood a moment\r\nwatching the man at work, "have you given up all hope of hearing from\r\nyour daughter?"\r\n\r\n"I don\' know, me; I don\' know. Le\' me work, M\'sieur Duplan."\r\n\r\n"For my part, I believe the child is alive."\r\n\r\n"You b\'lieve dat, you?" His rugged face was pitiful in its imploring\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n"I know it," Mr. Duplan muttered, as calmly as he could. "Hold up!\r\nSteady yourself, man! Come; come with me to the house. There is some\r\none there who knows it, too; some one who has seen her."\r\n\r\nThe room into which the planter led the old man was big, cool,\r\nbeautiful, and sweet with the delicate odor of flowers. It was shady,\r\ntoo, for the shutters were half closed; but not so darkened but\r\nSylveste could at once see Lolotte, seated in a big wicker chair.\r\n\r\nShe was almost as white as the gown she wore. Her neatly shod feet\r\nrested upon a cushion, and her black hair, that had been closely cut,\r\nwas beginning to make little rings about her temples.\r\n\r\n"Aie!" he cried sharply, at sight of her, grasping his seamed throat as\r\nhe did so. Then he laughed like a madman, and then he sobbed.\r\n\r\nHe only sobbed, kneeling upon the floor beside her, kissing her knees\r\nand her hands, that sought his. Little Nonomme was close to her, with\r\na health flush creeping into his cheek. Veveste and Jacques were there,\r\nand rather awed by the mystery and grandeur of everything.\r\n\r\n"W\'ere\'bouts you find her, M\'sieur Duplan?" Sylveste asked, when the\r\nfirst flush of his joy had spent itself, and he was wiping his eyes\r\nwith his rough cotton shirt sleeve.\r\n\r\n"M\'sieur Duplan find me \'way yonda to de city, papa, in de hospital,"\r\nspoke Lolotte, before the planter could steady his voice to reply. "I\r\ndid n\' know who ev\'ybody was, me. I did n\' know me, myse\'f, tell I tu\'n\r\nroun\' one day an\' see M\'sieur Duplan, w\'at stan\'en dere."\r\n\r\n"You was boun\' to know M\'sieur Duplan, Lolotte," laughed Sylveste, like\r\na child.\r\n\r\n"Yes, an\' I know right \'way how dem mule was git frighten\' w\'en de boat\r\nw\'istle fu stop, an\' pitch me plumb on de groun\'. An\' I rememba it was\r\none _mul\xc3\xa2tresse_ w\'at call herse\'f one chembamed, all de time aside me."\r\n\r\n"You must not talk too much, Lolotte," interposed Madame Duplan, coming\r\nto place her hand with gentle solicitude upon the girl\'s forehead, and\r\nto feel how her pulse beat.\r\n\r\nThen to save the child further effort of speech, she herself related\r\nhow the boat had stopped at this lonely landing to take on a load of\r\ncotton-seed. Lolotte had been found stretched insensible by the river,\r\nfallen apparently from the clouds, and had been taken on board.\r\n\r\nThe boat had changed its course into other waters after that trip, and\r\nhad not returned to Duplan\'s Landing. Those who had tended Lolotte and\r\nleft her at the hospital supposed, no doubt, that she would make known\r\nher identity in time, and they had troubled themselves no further about\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"An\' dah you is!" almost shouted aunt Minty, whose black face gleamed\r\nin the doorway; "dah you is, settin\' down, lookin\' jis\' like w\'ite\r\nfolks!"\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t I always was w\'ite folks, Aunt Mint?" smiled Lolotte, feebly.\r\n\r\n"G\'long, chile. You knows me. I don\' mean no harm."\r\n\r\n"And now, Sylveste," said Mr. Duplan, as he rose and started to walk\r\nthe floor, with hands in his pockets, "listen to me. It will be a long\r\ntime before Lolotte is strong again. Aunt Minty is going to look after\r\nthings for you till the child is fully recovered. But what I want to\r\nsay is this: I shall trust these children into your hands once more,\r\nand I want you never to forget again that you are their father--do you\r\nhear?--that you are a man!"\r\n\r\nOld Sylveste stood with his hand in Lolotte\'s, who rubbed it lovingly\r\nagainst her cheek.\r\n\r\n"By gracious! M\'sieur Duplan," he answered, "w\'en God want to he\'p me,\r\nI\'m goen try my bes\'!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE B\xc3\x8aNITOUS\' SLAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Uncle Oswald believed he belonged to the B\xc3\xaanitous, and there was\r\nno getting the notion out of his head. Monsieur tried every way, for\r\nthere was no sense in it. Why, it must have been fifty years since the\r\nB\xc3\xaanitous owned him. He had belonged to others since, and had later been\r\nfreed. Beside, there was not a B\xc3\xaanitou left in the parish now, except\r\none rather delicate woman, who lived with her little daughter in a\r\ncorner of Natchitoches town, and constructed "fashionable millinery."\r\nThe family had dispersed, and almost vanished, and the plantation as\r\nwell had lost its identity.\r\n\r\nBut that made no difference to Uncle Oswald. He was always running away\r\nfrom Monsieur--who kept him out of pure kindness--and trying to get\r\nback to those B\xc3\xaanitous.\r\n\r\nMore than that, he was constantly getting injured in such attempts.\r\nOnce he fell into the bayou and was nearly drowned. Again he barely\r\nescaped being run down by an engine. But another time, when he had been\r\nlost two days, and finally discovered in an unconscious and half-dead\r\ncondition in the woods, Monsieur and Doctor Bonfils reluctantly decided\r\nthat it was time to "do something" with the old man.\r\n\r\nSo, one sunny spring morning, Monsieur took Uncle Oswald in the buggy,\r\nand drove over to Natchitoches with him, intending to take the evening\r\ntrain for the institution in which the poor creature was to be cared\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nIt was quite early in the afternoon when they reached town, and\r\nMonsieur found himself with several hours to dispose of before\r\ntrain-time. He tied his horses in front of the hotel--the quaintest\r\nold stuccoed house, too absurdly unlike a "hotel" for anything--and\r\nentered. But he left Uncle Oswald seated upon a shaded bench just\r\nwithin the yard.\r\n\r\nThere were people occasionally coming in and going out; but no one took\r\nthe smallest notice of the old negro drowsing over the cane that he\r\nheld between his knees. The sight was common in Natchitoches.\r\n\r\nOne who passed in was a little girl about twelve, with dark, kind\r\neyes, and daintily carrying a parcel. She was dressed in blue calico,\r\nand wore a stiff white sun-bonnet, extinguisher fashion, over her brown\r\ncurls.\r\n\r\nJust as she passed Uncle Oswald again, on her way out, the old man,\r\nhalf asleep, let fall his cane. She picked it up and handed it back to\r\nhim, as any nice child would have done.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thankee, thankee, missy," stammered Uncle Oswald, all confused\r\nat being waited upon by this little lady. "You is a putty li\'le gal.\r\nW\'at\'s yo\' name, honey?"\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Susanne; Susanne B\xc3\xaanitou," replied the girl.\r\n\r\nInstantly the old negro stumbled to his feet. Without a moment\'s\r\nhesitancy he followed the little one out through the gate, down the\r\nstreet, and around the corner.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour later that Monsieur, after a distracted search, found\r\nhim standing upon the gallery of the tiny house in which Madame B\xc3\xaanitou\r\nkept "fashionable millinery."\r\n\r\nMother and daughter were sorely perplexed to comprehend the intentions\r\nof the venerable servitor, who stood, hat in hand, persistently\r\nawaiting their orders.\r\n\r\nMonsieur understood and appreciated the situation at once, and he has\r\nprevailed upon Madame B\xc3\xaanitou to accept the gratuitous services of\r\nUncle Oswald for the sake of the old darky\'s own safety and happiness.\r\n\r\nUncle Oswald never tries to run away now. He chops wood and hauls\r\nwater. He cheerfully and faithfully bears the parcels that Susanne used\r\nto carry; and makes an excellent cup of black coffee.\r\n\r\nI met the old man the other day in Natchitoches, contentedly stumbling\r\ndown St. Denis street with a basket of figs that some one was sending\r\nto his mistress. I asked him his name.\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Oswal\', Madam; Oswal\'--dat\'s my name. I b\'longs to de\r\nB\xc3\xaanitous," and some one told me his story then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xc3\x89SIR\xc3\x89E\'S BABY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the day was pleasant, Madame Valmond\xc3\xa9 drove over to L\'Abri to see\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e and the baby.\r\n\r\nIt made her laugh to think of D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e with a baby. Why, it seemed\r\nbut yesterday that D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e was little more than a baby herself; when\r\nMonsieur in riding through the gateway of Valmond\xc3\xa9 had found her lying\r\nasleep in the shadow of the big stone pillar.\r\n\r\nThe little one awoke in his arms and began to cry for "Dada." That was\r\nas much as she could do or say. Some people thought she might have\r\nstrayed there of her own accord, for she was of the toddling age. The\r\nprevailing belief was that she had been purposely left by a party of\r\nTexans, whose canvas-covered wagon, late in the day, had crossed the\r\nferry that Coton Ma\xc3\xafs kept, just below the plantation. In time Madame\r\nValmond\xc3\xa9 abandoned every speculation but the one that D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e had\r\nbeen sent to her by a beneficent Providence to be the child of her\r\naffection, seeing that she was without child of the flesh. For the girl\r\ngrew to be beautiful and gentle, affectionate and sincere,--the idol\r\nof Valmond\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder, when she stood one day against the stone pillar in\r\nwhose shadow she had lain asleep, eighteen years before, that Armand\r\nAubigny riding by and seeing her there, had fallen in love with her.\r\nThat was the way all the Aubignys fell in love, as if struck by a\r\npistol shot. The wonder was that he had not loved her before; for he\r\nhad known her since his father brought him home from Paris, a boy of\r\neight, after his mother died there. The passion that awoke in him that\r\nday, when he saw her at the gate, swept along like an avalanche, or\r\nlike a prairie fire, or like anything that drives headlong over all\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Valmond\xc3\xa9 grew practical and wanted things well considered:\r\nthat is, the girl\'s obscure origin. Armand looked into her eyes and did\r\nnot care. He was reminded that she was nameless. What did it matter\r\nabout a name when he could give her one of the oldest and proudest in\r\nLouisiana? He ordered the corbeille from Paris, and contained himself\r\nwith what patience he could until it arrived; then they were married.\r\n\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9 had not seen D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e and the baby for four weeks. When\r\nshe reached L\'Abri she shuddered at the first sight of it, as she\r\nalways did. It was a sad looking place, which for many years had not\r\nknown the gentle presence of a mistress, old Monsieur Aubigny having\r\nmarried and buried his wife in France, and she having loved her own\r\nland too well ever to leave it. The roof came down steep and black\r\nlike a cowl, reaching out beyond the wide galleries that encircled\r\nthe yellow stuccoed house. Big, solemn oaks grew close to it, and\r\ntheir thick-leaved, far-reaching branches shadowed it like a pall.\r\nYoung Aubigny\'s rule was a strict one, too, and under it his negroes\r\nhad forgotten how to be gay, as they had been during the old master\'s\r\neasy-going and indulgent lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe young mother was recovering slowly, and lay full length, in her\r\nsoft white muslins and laces, upon a couch. The baby was beside her,\r\nupon her arm, where he had fallen asleep, at her breast. The yellow\r\nnurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself.\r\n\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9 bent her portly figure over D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e and kissed her,\r\nholding her an instant tenderly in her arms. Then she turned to the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"This is not the baby!" she exclaimed, in startled tones. French was\r\nthe language spoken at Valmond\xc3\xa9 in those days.\r\n\r\n"I knew you would be astonished," laughed D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e, "at the way he has\r\ngrown. The little _cochon de lait!_ Look at his legs, mamma, and his\r\nhands and finger-nails,--real finger-nails. Zandrine had to cut them\r\nthis morning. Is n\'t it true, Zandrine?"\r\n\r\nThe woman bowed her turbaned head majestically, "Mais si, Madame."\r\n\r\n"And the way he cries," went on D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e, "is deafening. Armand heard\r\nhim the other day as far away as La Blanche\'s cabin."\r\n\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9 had never removed her eyes from the child. She lifted\r\nit and walked with it over to the window that was lightest. She scanned\r\nthe baby narrowly, then looked as searchingly at Zandrine, whose face\r\nwas burned to gaze across the fields.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the child has grown, has changed;" said Madame Valmond\xc3\xa9, slowly,\r\nas she replaced it beside its mother. "What does Armand say?"\r\n\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e\'s face became suffused with a glow that was happiness itself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Armand is the proudest father in the parish, I believe, chiefly\r\nbecause it is a boy, to bear his name; though he says not,--that he\r\nwould have loved a girl as well. But I know it is n\'t true. I know\r\nhe says that to please me. And mamma," she added, drawing Madame\r\nValmond\xc3\xa9\'s head down to her, and speaking in a whisper, "he has n\'t\r\npunished one of them--not one of them--since baby is born. Even\r\nN\xc3\xa9grillon, who pretended to have burnt his leg that he might rest from\r\nwork--he only, laughed, and said N\xc3\xa9grillon was a great scamp. Oh,\r\nmamma, I\'m so happy; it frightens me."\r\n\r\nWhat D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e said was true. Marriage, and later the birth of his son,\r\nhad softened Armand Aubigny\'s imperious and exacting nature greatly.\r\nThis was what made the gentle D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e so happy, for she loved him\r\ndesperately. When he frowned she trembled, but loved him. When he\r\nsmiled, she asked no greater blessing of God. But Armand\'s dark,\r\nhandsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he\r\nfell in love with her.\r\n\r\nWhen the baby was about three months old, D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e awoke one day to the\r\nconviction that there was something in the air menacing her peace.\r\nIt was at first too subtle to grasp. It had only been a disquieting\r\nsuggestion; an air of mystery among the blacks; unexpected visits from\r\nfar-off neighbors who could hardly account for their coming. Then a\r\nstrange, an awful change in her husband\'s manner, which she dared not\r\nask him to explain. When he spoke to her, it was with averted eyes,\r\nfrom which the old love-light seemed to have gone out. He absented\r\nhimself from home; and when there, avoided her presence and that of her\r\nchild, without excuse. And the very spirit of Satan seemed suddenly to\r\ntake hold of him in his dealings with the slaves. D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e was miserable\r\nenough to die.\r\n\r\nShe sat in her room, one hot afternoon, in her _peignoir_, listlessly\r\ndrawing through her fingers the strands of her long, silky brown hair\r\nthat hung about her shoulders. The baby, half naked, lay asleep upon\r\nher own great mahogany bed, that was like a sumptuous throne, with\r\nits satin-lined half-canopy. One of La Blanche\'s little quadroon\r\nboys--half naked too--stood fanning the child slowly with a fan of\r\npeacock feathers. D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e\'s eyes had been fixed absently and sadly upon\r\nthe baby, while she was striving to penetrate the threatening mist that\r\nshe felt closing about her. She looked from her child to the boy who\r\nstood beside him, and back again; over and over. "Ah!" It was a cry\r\nthat she could not help; which she was not conscious of having uttered.\r\nThe blood turned like ice in her veins, and a clammy moisture gathered\r\nupon her face.\r\n\r\nShe tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would\r\ncome, at first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his\r\nmistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great, soft fan,\r\nand obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes.\r\n\r\nShe stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face\r\nthe picture of fright.\r\n\r\nPresently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went\r\nto a table and began to search among some papers which covered it.\r\n\r\n"Armand," she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him,\r\nif he was human. But he did not notice. "Armand," she said again. Then\r\nshe rose and tottered towards him. "Armand," she panted once more,\r\nclutching his arm, "look at our child. What does it mean? tell me."\r\n\r\nHe coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust\r\nthe hand away from him. "Tell me what it means!" she cried despairingly.\r\n\r\n"It means," he answered lightly, "that the child is not white; it means\r\nthat you are not white."\r\n\r\nA quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her\r\nwith unwonted courage to deny it. "It is a lie; it is not true, I am\r\nwhite! Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are gray, Armand, you\r\nknow they are gray. And my skin is fair," seizing his wrist. "Look at\r\nmy hand; whiter than yours, Armand," she laughed hysterically.\r\n\r\n"As white as La Blanche\'s," he returned cruelly; and went away leaving\r\nher alone with their child.\r\n\r\nWhen she could hold a pen in her hand, she sent a despairing letter to\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n"My mother, they tell me I am not white. Armand has told me I am not\r\nwhite. For God\'s sake tell them it is not true. You must know it is not\r\ntrue. I shall die. I must die. I cannot be so unhappy, and live.".\r\n\r\nThe answer that came was as brief:\r\n\r\n"My own D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e: Come home to Valmond\xc3\xa9; back to your mother who loves\r\nyou. Come with your child."\r\n\r\nWhen the letter reached D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e she went with it to her husband\'s\r\nstudy, and laid it open upon the desk before which he sat. She was like\r\na stone image: silent, white, motionless after she placed it there.\r\n\r\nIn silence he ran his cold eyes over the written words. He said\r\nnothing. "Shall I go, Armand?" she asked in tones sharp with agonized\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\n"Yes, go."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I want you to go."\r\n\r\nHe thought Almighty God had dealt cruelly and unjustly with him; and\r\nfelt, somehow, that he was paying Him back in kind when he stabbed thus\r\ninto his wife\'s soul. Moreover he no longer loved her, because of the\r\nunconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name.\r\n\r\nShe turned away like one stunned by a blow, and walked slowly towards\r\nthe door, hoping he would call her back.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Armand," she moaned.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer her. That was his last blow at fate.\r\n\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e went in search of her child. Zandrine was pacing the sombre\r\ngallery with it. She took the little one from the nurse\'s arms with no\r\nword of explanation, and descending the steps, walked away, under the\r\nlive-oak branches.\r\n\r\nIt was an October afternoon; the sun was just sinking. Out in the still\r\nfields the negroes were picking cotton.\r\n\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e had not changed the thin white garment nor the slippers which\r\nshe wore. Her hair was uncovered and the sun\'s rays brought a golden\r\ngleam from its brown meshes. She did not take the broad, beaten road\r\nwhich led to the far-off plantation of Valmond\xc3\xa9. She walked across\r\na deserted field, where the stubble bruised her tender feet, so\r\ndelicately shod, and tore her thin gown to shreds.\r\n\r\nShe disappeared among the reeds and willows that grew thick along the\r\nbanks of the deep, sluggish bayou; and she did not come back again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome weeks later there was a curious scene enacted at L\'Abri. In\r\nthe centre of the smoothly swept back yard was a great bonfire.\r\nArmand Aubigny sat in the wide hall-way that commanded a view of the\r\nspectacle; and it was he who dealt out to a half dozen negroes the\r\nmaterial which kept this fire ablaze.\r\n\r\nA graceful cradle of willow, with all its dainty furbishings, was\r\nlaid upon the pyre, which had already been fed with the richness of a\r\npriceless _layette_. Then there were silk gowns, and velvet and satin\r\nones added to these; laces, too, and embroideries; bonnets and gloves;\r\nfor the _corbeille_ had been of rare quality.\r\n\r\nThe last thing to go was a tiny bundle of letters; innocent little\r\nscribblings that D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e had sent to him during the days of their\r\nespousal. There was the remnant of one back in the drawer from which he\r\ntook them. But it was not D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e\'s; it was part of an old letter from\r\nhis mother to his father. He read it. She was thanking God for the\r\nblessing of her husband\'s love:--\r\n\r\n"But, above all," she wrote, "night and day, I thank the good God for\r\nhaving so arranged our lives that our dear Armand will never know that\r\nhis mother, who adores him, belongs to the race that is cursed with the\r\nbrand of slavery."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TURKEY HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nThree of Madame\'s finest bronze turkeys were missing from the brood.\r\nIt was nearing Christmas, and that was the reason, perhaps, that even\r\nMonsieur grew agitated when the discovery was made. The news was\r\nbrought to the house by S\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9rin\'s boy, who had seen the troop at noon a\r\nhalf mile up the bayou three short. Others reported the deficiency as\r\neven greater. So, at about two in the afternoon, though a cold drizzle\r\nhad begun to fall, popular feeling in the matter was so strong that all\r\nthe household forces turned out to search for the missing gobblers.\r\n\r\nAlice, the housemaid, went down the river, and Polisson the yard-boy,\r\nwent up the bayou. Others crossed the fields, and Artemise was rather\r\nvaguely instructed to "go look too."\r\n\r\nArtemise is in some respects an extraordinary person. In age she\'s\r\nanywhere between 10 and 15, with a head not unlike in shape and\r\nappearance to a dark chocolate-colored Easter-egg. She talks most\r\nwholly in monosyllables, and has big round glassy eyes, which she fixes\r\nupon one with the placid gaze of an Egyptian sphinx.\r\n\r\nThe morning after my arrival at the plantation, I was awakened by the\r\nrattling of cups at my bedside. It was Artemise with the early coffee.\r\n\r\n"Is it cold out?" I asked by way of conversation, as I sipped the tiny\r\ncup of ink-black coffee.\r\n\r\n"Ya, \'m."\r\n\r\n"Where do you sleep, Artemise?" I further inquired, with the same\r\nintention as before.\r\n\r\n"In uh hole," was precisely what she said, with a pump-like motion of\r\nthe arm that she habitually uses to indicate a locality. What she meant\r\nwas that she slept in the hall.\r\n\r\nAgain, another time, she came with an armful of wood, and having\r\ndeposited it upon the hearth, turn to stare fixedly at me, with folded\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"Did Madame send you to build a fire, Artemise?" I hastened to ask,\r\nfeeling uncomfortable under the look.\r\n\r\n"Ya, \'m."\r\n\r\n"Very well; make it."\r\n\r\n"Matches!" was all she said.\r\n\r\nThere happened to be no matches in my room, and she evidently\r\nconsidered that all personal responsibility ceased in face of this\r\nfirst and not very serious obstacle. Pages might be told of her\r\nunfathomable ways; but to the turkey hunt.\r\n\r\nAll afternoon the searching party kept returning, singly and in\r\ncouples, and in a more or less bedraggled condition. All brought\r\nunfavorable reports. Nothing could be seen of the missing fowls.\r\nArtemise had been absent probably an hour when she glided into the\r\nhall where the family was assembled, an stood with crossed hands\r\nand contemplative air beside the fire. We could see by the benign\r\nexpression of her countenance that she possibly had information to\r\ngive, if any inducement were offered her in the shape of a question.\r\n\r\n"Have you found the turkeys, Artemise?" Madame hastened to ask.\r\n\r\n"Ya, \'m."\r\n\r\n"You Artemise!" shouted Aunt Florindy, the cook, who was passing\r\nthrough the hall with a batch of newly baked light bread. "She\'s\r\na-lyin\', mist\'ess, if dey ever was! _You_ foun\' dem turkeys?" upon the\r\nchild. "Whar was you at, de whole blesse\' time? Warn\'t you stan\'in\'\r\nplank up agin de back o\' de hen-\'ous\'? Never budged a inch? Don\'t jaw\r\nme down, gal; don\'t jaw me!" Artemise was only gazing at Aunt Florindy\r\nwith unruffled calm. "I warn\'t gwine tell on \'er, but arter dat\r\nuntroof, I boun\' to."\r\n\r\n"Let her alone, Aunt Florindy," Madame interfered. "Where are the\r\nturkeys, Artemise?"\r\n\r\n"Yon\'a," she simply articulated, bringing the pump-handle motion of her\r\narm into play.\r\n\r\n"Where \'yonder\'?" Madame demanded, a little impatiently.\r\n\r\n"In uh hen-\'ous\'!"\r\n\r\nSure enough! The three missing turkeys had been accidentally locked up\r\nin the morning when the chickens were fed.\r\n\r\nArtemise, for some unknown reason, had hidden herself during the search\r\nbehind the hen-house, and had heard their muffled gobble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME C\xc3\x89LESTIN\'S DIVORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame C\xc3\xa9lestin always wore a neat and snugly fitting calico wrapper\r\nwhen she went out in the morning to sweep her small gallery. Lawyer\r\nPaxton thought she looked very pretty in the gray one that was made\r\nwith a graceful Watteau fold at the back: and with which she invariably\r\nwore a bow of pink ribbon at the throat. She was always sweeping her\r\ngallery when lawyer Paxton passed by in the morning on his way to his\r\noffice in St. Denis Street.\r\n\r\nSometimes he stopped and leaned over the fence to say good-morning at\r\nhis ease; to criticise or admire her rosebushes; or, when he had time\r\nenough, to hear what she had to say. Madame C\xc3\xa9lestin usually had a\r\ngood deal to say. She would gather up the train of her calico wrapper\r\nin one hand, and balancing the broom gracefully in the other, would go\r\ntripping down to where the lawyer leaned, as comfortably as he could,\r\nover her picket fence.\r\n\r\nOf course she had talked to him of her troubles. Every one knew Madame\r\nC\xc3\xa9lestin\'s troubles.\r\n\r\n"Really, madame," he told her once, in his deliberate, calculating,\r\nlawyer--tone, "it\'s more than human nature--woman\'s nature--should be\r\ncalled upon to endure. Here you are, working your fingers off"--she\r\nglanced down at two rosy finger-tips that showed through the rents in\r\nher baggy doe-skin gloves--"taking in sewing; giving music lessons;\r\ndoing God knows what in the way of manual labor to support yourself\r\nand those two little ones"--Madame C\xc3\xa9lestin\'s pretty face beamed with\r\nsatisfaction at this enumeration of her trials.\r\n\r\n"You right, Judge. Not a picayune, not one, not one, have I lay my eyes\r\non in the pas\' fo\' months that I can say C\xc3\xa9lestin give it to me or sen\'\r\nit to me."\r\n\r\n"The scoundrel!" muttered lawyer Paxton in his beard.\r\n\r\n"An\' _pourtant_," she resumed, "they say he\'s making money down roun\'\r\nAlexandria w\'en he wants to work."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you have n\'t seen him for months?" suggested the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s good six month\' since I see a sight of C\xc3\xa9lestin," she admitted.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, that\'s what I say; he has practically deserted you; fails\r\nto support you. It wouldn\'t surprise me a bit to learn that he has ill\r\ntreated you."\r\n\r\n"Well, you know, Judge," with an evasive cough, "a man that\r\ndrinks--w\'at can you expec\'? An\' if you would know the promises he has\r\nmade me! Ah, if I had as many dolla\' as I had promise from C\xc3\xa9lestin, I\r\nwould n\' have to work, _je vous garantis_."\r\n\r\n"And in my opinion, madame, you would be a foolish woman to endure it\r\nlonger, when the divorce court is there to offer you redress."\r\n\r\n"You spoke about that befo\', Judge; I\'m goin\' think about that divo\'ce.\r\nI believe you right."\r\n\r\nMadame C\xc3\xa9lestin thought about the divorce and talked about it, too; and\r\nlawyer Paxton grew deeply interested in the theme.\r\n\r\n"You know, about that divo\'ce, Judge," Madame C\xc3\xa9lestin was waiting for\r\nhim that morning, "I been talking to my family an\' my frien\'s, an\' it\'s\r\nme that tells you, they all plumb agains\' that divo\'ce."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, to be sure; that\'s to be expected, madame, in this\r\ncommunity of Creoles. I warned you that you would meet with\r\nopposition, and would have to face it and brave it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t fear, I\'m going to face it! Maman says it\'s a disgrace like\r\nit\'s neva been in the family. But it\'s good for Maman to talk, her.\r\nW\'at trouble she ever had? She says I mus\' go by all means consult with\r\nP\xc3\xa8re Duch\xc3\xa9ron--it\'s my confessor, you undastan\'--Well, I\'ll go, Judge,\r\nto please Maman. But all the confessor\' in the worl\' ent goin\' make me\r\nput up with that conduc\' of C\xc3\xa9lestin any longa."\r\n\r\nA day or two later, she was there waiting for him again. "You know,\r\nJudge, about that divo\'ce."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," responded the lawyer, well pleased to trace a new\r\ndetermination in her brown eyes and in the curves of her pretty mouth.\r\n"I suppose you saw P\xc3\xa8re Duch\xc3\xa9ron and had to brave it out with him, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, fo\' that, a perfec\' sermon, I assho you. A talk of giving scandal\r\nan\' bad example that I thought would neva en\'! He says, fo\' him, he\r\nwash\' his hands; I mus\' go see the bishop."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t let the bishop dissuade you, I trust," stammered the lawyer\r\nmore anxiously than he could well understand.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know me yet, Judge," laughed Madame C\xc3\xa9lestin with a turn of\r\nthe head and a flirt of the broom which indicated that the interview\r\nwas at an end.\r\n\r\n"Well, Madame C\xc3\xa9lestin! And the bishop!" Lawyer Paxton was standing\r\nthere holding to a couple of the shaky pickets. She had not seen\r\nhim. "Oh, it\'s you, Judge?" and she hastened towards him with an\r\n_empressement_ that could not but have been flattering.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I saw Monseigneur," she began. The lawyer had already gathered\r\nfrom her expressive countenance that she had not wavered in her\r\ndetermination. "Ah, he\'s a eloquent man. It\'s not a mo\' eloquent man\r\nin Natchitoches parish. I was fo\'ced to cry, the way he talked to me\r\nabout my troubles; how he undastan\'s them, an\' feels for me. It would\r\nmove even you, Judge, to hear how he talk\' about that step I want to\r\ntake; its danga, its temptation. How it is the duty of a Catholic to\r\nstan\' everything till the las\' extreme. An\' that life of retirement an\'\r\nself-denial I would have to lead,--he tole me all that."\r\n\r\n"But he has n\'t turned you from your resolve, I see," laughed the\r\nlawyer complacently.\r\n\r\n"For that, no," she returned emphatically. "The bishop don\'t know w\'at\r\nit is to be married to a man like C\xc3\xa9lestin, an\' have to endu\' that\r\nconduc\' like I have to endu\' it. The Pope himse\'f can\'t make me stan\'\r\nthat any longer, if you say I got the right in the law to sen\' C\xc3\xa9lestin\r\nsailing."\r\n\r\nA noticeable change had come over lawyer Paxton. He discarded his\r\nwork-day coat and began to wear his Sunday one to the office. He grew\r\nsolicitous as to the shine of his boots, his collar, and the set of\r\nhis tie. He brushed and trimmed his whiskers with a care that had not\r\nbefore been apparent. Then he fell into a stupid habit of dreaming\r\nas he walked the streets of the old town. It would be very good to\r\ntake unto himself a wife, he dreamed. And he could dream of no other\r\nthan pretty Madame C\xc3\xa9lestin filling that sweet and sacred office as\r\nshe filled his thoughts, now. Old Natchitoches would not hold them\r\ncomfortably, perhaps; but the world was surely wide enough to live in,\r\noutside of Natchitoches town.\r\n\r\nHis heart beat in a strangely irregular manner as he neared Madame\r\nC\xc3\xa9lestin\'s house one morning, and discovered her behind the\r\nrosebushes, as usual plying her broom. She had finished the gallery\r\nand steps and was sweeping the little brick walk along the edge of the\r\nviolet border.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Madame C\xc3\xa9lestin."\r\n\r\n"Ah, it\'s you, Judge? Good-morning." He waited. She seemed to be\r\ndoing the same. Then she ventured, with some hesitancy, "You know,\r\nJudge, about that divo\'ce. I been thinking,--I reckon you betta neva\r\nmine about that divo\'ce." She was making deep rings in the palm of\r\nher gloved hand with the end of the broom-handle, and looking at them\r\ncritically. Her face seemed to the lawyer to be unusually rosy; but\r\nmaybe it was only the reflection of the pink bow at the throat. "Yes, I\r\nreckon you need n\' mine. You see, Judge, C\xc3\xa9lestin came home las\' night.\r\nAn\' he\'s promise me on his word an\' honor he\'s going to turn ova a new\r\nleaf."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE ON THE BON-DIEU.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the pleasant veranda of P\xc3\xa8re Antoine\'s cottage, that adjoined the\r\nchurch, a young girl had long been seated, awaiting his return. It was\r\nthe eve of Easter Sunday, and since early afternoon the priest had\r\nbeen engaged in hearing the confessions of those who wished to make\r\ntheir Easters the following day. The girl did not seem impatient at his\r\ndelay; on the contrary, it was very restful to her to lie back in the\r\nbig chair she had found there, and peep through the thick curtain of\r\nvines at the people who occasionally passed along the village street.\r\n\r\nShe was slender, with a frailness that indicated lack of wholesome and\r\nplentiful nourishment. A pathetic, uneasy look was in her gray eyes,\r\nand even faintly stamped her features, which were fine and delicate. In\r\nlieu of a hat, a barege veil covered her light brown and abundant hair.\r\nShe wore a coarse white cotton "josie," and a blue calico skirt that\r\nonly half concealed her tattered shoes.\r\n\r\nAs she sat there, she held carefully in her lap a parcel of eggs\r\nsecurely fastened in a red bandana handkerchief.\r\n\r\nTwice already a handsome, stalwart young man in quest of the priest had\r\nentered the yard, and penetrated to where she sat. At first they had\r\nexchanged the uncompromising "howdy" of strangers, and nothing more.\r\nThe second time, finding the priest still absent, he hesitated to go at\r\nonce. Instead, he stood upon the step, and narrowing his brown eyes,\r\ngazed beyond the river, off towards the west, where a murky streak of\r\nmist was spreading across the sun.\r\n\r\n"It look like mo\' rain," he remarked, slowly and carelessly.\r\n\r\n"We done had \'bout \'nough," she replied, in much the same tone.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no chance to thin out the cotton," he went on.\r\n\r\n"An\' the Bon-Dieu," she resumed, "it\'s on\'y to-day you can cross him on\r\nfoot."\r\n\r\n"You live yonda on the Bon-Dieu, _donc_?" he asked, looking at her for\r\nthe first time since he had spoken.\r\n\r\n"Yas, by Nid d\'Hibout, m\'sieur."\r\n\r\nInstinctive courtesy held him from questioning her further. But he\r\nseated himself on the step, evidently determined to wait there for the\r\npriest. He said no more, but sat scanning critically the steps, the\r\nporch, and pillar beside him, from which he occasionally tore away\r\nlittle pieces of detached wood, where it was beginning to rot at its\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nA click at the side gate that communicated with the churchyard\r\nsoon announced P\xc3\xa8re Antoine\'s return. He came hurriedly across the\r\ngarden-path, between the tall, lusty rosebushes that lined either\r\nside of it, which were now fragrant with blossoms. His long, flapping\r\ncassock added something of height to his undersized, middle-aged\r\nfigure, as did the skullcap which rested securely back on his head. He\r\nsaw only the young man at first, who rose at his approach.\r\n\r\n"Well, Azenor," he called cheerily in French, extending his hand. "How\r\nis this? I expected you all the week."\r\n\r\n"Yes, monsieur; but I knew well what you wanted with me, and I was\r\nfinishing the doors for Gros-L\xc3\xa9on\'s new house;" saying which, he drew\r\nback, and indicated by a motion and look that some one was present who\r\nhad a prior claim upon P\xc3\xa8re Antoine\'s attention.--\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lalie!" the priest exclaimed, when he had mounted to the porch,\r\nand saw her there behind the vines. "Have you been waiting here since\r\nyou confessed? Surely an hour ago!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, monsieur."\r\n\r\n"You should rather have made some visits in the village, child."\r\n\r\n"I am not acquainted with any one in the village," she returned.\r\n\r\nThe priest, as he spoke, had drawn a chair, and seated himself beside\r\nher, with his hands comfortably clasping his knees. He wanted to know\r\nhow things were out on the bayou.\r\n\r\n"And how is the grandmother?" he asked. "As cross and crabbed as ever?\r\nAnd with that"--he added reflectively--"good for ten years yet! I said\r\nonly yesterday to Butrand--you know Butrand, he works on Le Bl\xc3\xb4t\'s\r\nBon-Dieu place--\'And that Madame Zidore: how is it with her, Butrand?\r\nI believe God has forgotten her here on earth.\' \'It is n\'t that, your\r\nreverence,\' said Butrand, \'but it\'s neither God nor the Devil that\r\nwants her!\'" And P\xc3\xa8re Antoine laughed with a jovial frankness that took\r\nall sting of ill-nature from his very pointed remarks.\r\n\r\nLalie did not reply when he spoke of her grandmother; she only pressed\r\nher lips firmly together, and picked nervously at the red bandana.\r\n\r\n"I have come to ask, Monsieur Antoine," she began, lower than she\r\nneeded to speak--for Azenor had withdrawn at once to the far end of\r\nthe porch--"to ask if you will give me a little scrap of paper--a piece\r\nof writing for Monsieur Chartrand at the store over there. I want new\r\nshoes and stockings for Easter, and I have brought eggs to trade for\r\nthem. He says he is willing, yes, if he was sure I would bring more\r\nevery week till the shoes are paid for."\r\n\r\nWith good-natured indifference, P\xc3\xa8re Antoine wrote the order that the\r\ngirl desired. He was too familiar with distress to feel keenly for a\r\ngirl who was able to buy Easter shoes and pay for them with eggs.\r\n\r\nShe went immediately away then, after shaking hands with the priest,\r\nand sending a quick glance of her pathetic eyes towards Azenor, who had\r\nturned when he heard her rise, and nodded when he caught the look.\r\nThrough the vines he watched her cross the village street.\r\n\r\n"How is it that you do not know Lalie, Azenor? You surely must have\r\nseen her pass your house often. It lies on her way to the Bon-Dieu."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t know her; I have never seen her,", the young man replied,\r\nas he seated himself--after the priest--and kept his eyes absently\r\nfixed on the store across the road, where he had seen her enter.\r\n\r\n"She is the granddaughter of that Madame Izidore"--\r\n\r\n"What! Ma\'ame Zidore whom they drove off the island last winter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. Well, you know, they say the old woman stole wood and\r\nthings,--I don\'t know how true it is,--and destroyed people\'s property\r\nout of pure malice."\r\n\r\n"And she lives now on the Bon-Dieu?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, on Le Bl\xc3\xb4t\'s place, in a perfect wreck of a cabin. You see, she\r\ngets it for nothing; not a negro on the place but has refused to live\r\nin it."\r\n\r\n"Surely, it can\'t be that old abandoned hovel near the swamp, that\r\nMichon occupied ages ago?"\r\n\r\n"That is the one, the very one."\r\n\r\n"And the girl lives there with that old wretch?" the young man marveled.\r\n\r\n"Old wretch to be sure, Azenor. But what can you expect from a woman\r\nwho never crosses the threshold of God\'s house--who even tried to\r\nhinder the child doing so as well? But I went to her. I said: \'See\r\nhere, Madame Zidore,\'--you know it\'s my way to handle such people\r\nwithout gloves,--\'you may damn your soul if you choose,\' I told her,\r\n\'that is a privilege which we all have; but none of us has a right to\r\nimperil the salvation of another. I want to see Lalie at mass hereafter\r\non Sundays, or you will hear from me;\' and I shook my stick under\r\nher nose. Since then the child has never missed a Sunday. But she is\r\nhalf starved, you can see that. You saw how shabby she is--how broken\r\nher shoes are? She is at Chartrand\'s now, trading for new ones with\r\nthose eggs she brought, poor thing! There is no doubt of her being\r\nill-treated. Butrand says he thinks Madame Zidore even beats the child.\r\nI don\'t know how true it is, for no power can make her utter a word\r\nagainst her grandmother."\r\n\r\nAzenor, whose face was a kind and sensitive one, had paled with\r\ndistress as the priest spoke; and now at these final words he quivered\r\nas though he felt the sting of a cruel blow upon his own flesh.\r\n\r\nBut no more was said of Lalie, for P\xc3\xa8re Antoine drew the young man\'s\r\nattention to the carpenter-work which he wished to intrust to him. When\r\nthey had talked the matter over in all its lengthy details, Azenor\r\nmounted his horse and rode away.\r\n\r\nA moment\'s gallop carried him outside the village. Then came a\r\nhalf-mile strip along the river to cover. Then the lane to enter, in\r\nwhich stood his dwelling midway, upon a low, pleasant knoll.\r\n\r\nAs Azenor turned into the lane, he saw the figure of Lalie far ahead\r\nof him. Somehow he had expected to find her there, and he watched her\r\nagain, as he had done through P\xc3\xa8re Antoine\'s vines. When she passed his\r\nhouse, he wondered if she would turn to look at it. But she did not.\r\nHow could she know it was his? Upon reaching it himself, he did not\r\nenter the yard, but stood there motionless,\'his eyes always fastened\r\nupon the girl\'s figure. He could not see, away off there, how coarse\r\nher garments were. She seemed, through the distance that divided them,\r\nas slim and delicate as a flower-stalk. He stayed till she reached the\r\nturn of the lane and disappeared into the woods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMass had not yet begun when Azenor tiptoed into church on Easter\r\nmorning. He did not take his place with the congregation, but stood\r\nclose to the holy-water font, and watched the people who entered.\r\n\r\nAlmost every girl who passed him wore a white mull, a dotted swiss,\r\nor a fresh-starched muslin at least. They were bright with ribbons\r\nthat hung from their persons, and flowers that bedecked their hats.\r\nSome carried fans and cambric handkerchiefs. Most of them wore gloves,\r\nand were odorant of _poudre de riz_ and nice toilet-waters; while all\r\ncarried gay little baskets filled with Easter-eggs.\r\n\r\nBut there was one who came empty-handed, save for the worn prayer-book\r\nwhich she bore. It was Lalie, the veil upon her head, and wearing the\r\nblue print and cotton bodice which she had worn the day before.\r\n\r\nHe dipped his hand into the holy water when she came, and held it\r\nout to her, though he had not thought of doing this for the others.\r\nShe touched his fingers with the tips of her own, making a slight\r\ninclination as she did so; and after a deep genuflection before the\r\nBlessed Sacrament, passed on to the side. He was not sure if she had\r\nknown him. He knew she had not looked into his eyes, for he would have\r\nfelt it.\r\n\r\nHe was angered against other young women who passed him, because of\r\ntheir flowers and ribbons, when she wore none. He himself did not care,\r\nbut he feared she might, and watched her narrowly to see if she did.\r\n\r\nBut it was plain that Lalie did not care. Her face, as she seated\r\nherself, settled into the same restful lines it had worn yesterday,\r\nwhen she sat in P\xc3\xa8re Antoine\'s big chair. It seemed good to her to be\r\nthere. Sometimes she looked up at the little colored panes through\r\nwhich the Easter sun was streaming; then at the flaming candles, like\r\nstars; or at the embowered figures of Joseph and Mary, flanking the\r\ncentral tabernacle which shrouded the risen Christ. Yet she liked just\r\nas well to watch the young girls in their spring freshness, or to\r\nsensuously inhale the mingled odor of flowers and incense that filled\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\nLalie was among the last to quit the church. When she walked down the\r\nclean pathway that led from it to the road, she looked with pleased\r\ncuriosity towards the groups of men and maidens who were gayly matching\r\ntheir Easter-eggs under the shade of the China-berry trees.\r\n\r\nAzenor was among them, and when he saw her coming solitary down the\r\npath, he approached her and, with a smile, extended his hat, whose\r\ncrown was quite lined with the pretty colored eggs.\r\n\r\n"You mus\' of forgot to bring aiggs," he said. "Take some o\' mine."\r\n\r\n"Non, merci," she replied, flushing and drawing back.\r\n\r\nBut he urged them anew upon her. Much pleased, then, she bent her\r\npretty head over the hat, and was evidently puzzled to make a selection\r\namong so many that were beautiful.\r\n\r\nHe picked out one for her,--a pink one, dotted with white clover-leaves.\r\n\r\n"Yere," he said, handing it to her, "I think this is the prettied\'; an\'\r\nit look\' strong too. I\'m sho\' it will break all of the res\'." And he\r\nplayfully held out another, half-hidden in his fist, for her to try its\r\nstrength upon. But she refused to. She would not risk the ruin of her\r\npretty egg. Then she walked away, without once having noticed that the\r\ngirls, whom Azenor had left, were looking curiously at her.\r\n\r\nWhen he rejoined them, he was hardly prepared for their greeting; it\r\nstartled him.\r\n\r\n"How come you talk to that girl? She\'s real canaille, her," was what\r\none of them said to him.\r\n\r\n"Who say\' so? Who say she\'s canaille? If it\'s a man, I \'ll smash \'is\r\nhead!" he exclaimed, livid. They all laughed merrily at this.\r\n\r\n"An\' if it\'s a lady, Azenor? W\'at you goin\' to do \'bout it?" asked\r\nanother, quizzingly.\r\n\r\n"T ain\' no lady. No lady would say that \'bout a po\' girl, w\'at she\r\ndon\'t even know."\r\n\r\nHe turned away, and emptying all his eggs into the hat of a little\r\nurchin who stood near, walked out of the churchyard. He did not stop to\r\nexchange another word with any one; neither with the men who stood all\r\n_endimanch\xc3\xa9s_ before the stores, nor the women who were mounting upon\r\nhorses and into vehicles, or walking in groups to their homes.\r\n\r\nHe took a short cut across the cotton-field that extended back of\r\nthe town, and walking rapidly, soon reached his home. It was a\r\npleasant house of few rooms and many windows, with fresh air blowing\r\nthrough from every side; his workshop was beside it. A broad strip of\r\ngreensward, studded here and there with trees, sloped down to the road.\r\n\r\nAzenor entered the kitchen, where an amiable old black woman was\r\nchopping onion and sage at a table.\r\n\r\n"Tranquiline," he said abruptly, "they\'s a young girl goin\' to pass\r\nyere afta a w\'ile. She\'s got a blue dress an\' w\'ite josie on, an\' a\r\nveil on her head. W\'en you see her, I want you to go to the road an\'\r\nmake her res\' there on the bench, an\' ask her if she don\'t want a\r\ncup o\' coffee. I saw her go to communion, me; so she did n\'t eat any\r\nbreak-fas\'. Eve\'ybody else f\'om out o\' town, that went to communion,\r\ngot invited somew\'ere another. It\'s enough to make a person sick to see\r\nsuch meanness."\r\n\r\n"An\' you want me ter go down to de gate, jis\' so, an\' ax \'er pineblank\r\nef she wants some coffee?" asked the bewildered Tranquiline.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if you ask her poin\' blank o\' not; but you do like I\r\nsay." Tranquiline was leaning over the gate when Lalie came along.\r\n\r\n"Howdy," offered the woman.\r\n\r\n"Howdy," the girl returned.\r\n\r\n"Did you see a yalla calf wid black spots a t\'arm\' down de lane, missy?"\r\n\r\n"Non; not yalla, an\' not with black spot\'. _Mais_ I see one li\'le w\'ite\r\ncalf tie by a rope, yonda \'roun\' the ben\'."\r\n\r\n"Dat warn\'t hit. Dis heah one was yalla. I hope he done flung hisse\'f\r\ndown de bank an\' broke his nake. Sarve \'im right! But whar you come\r\nf\'om, chile? You look plum wo\' out. Set down dah on dat bench, an\' le\'\r\nme fotch you a cup o\' coffee."\r\n\r\nAzenor had already in his eagerness arranged a tray, upon which\r\nwas a smoking cup of _caf\xc3\xa9 au lait_. He had buttered and jellied\r\ngenerous slices of bread, and was searching wildly for something when\r\nTranquiline re\xc3\xabntered.\r\n\r\n"W\'at become o\' that half of chicken-pie, Tranquiline, that was yere in\r\nthe _garde manger_ yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"W\'at chicken-pie? W\'at _garde manger_?" blustered the woman.\r\n\r\n"Like we got mo\' \'en one _garde manger_ in the house, Tranquiline!"\r\n\r\n"You jis\' like ole Ma\'ame Azenor use\' to be, you is! You \'spec\'\r\nchicken-pie gwine las\' etarnal? W\'en some\'pin done sp\'ilt, I flings it\'\r\nway. Dat\'s me--dat\'s Tranquiline!"\r\n\r\nSo Azenor resigned himself,--what else could he do?--and sent the tray,\r\nincomplete, as he fancied it, out to Lalie.\r\n\r\nHe trembled at thought of what he did; he, whose nerves were usually as\r\nsteady as some piece of steel mechanism.\r\n\r\nWould it anger her if she suspected? Would it please her if she knew?\r\nWould she say this or that to Tranquiline? And would Tranquiline tell\r\nhim truly what she said--how she looked?\r\n\r\nAs it was Sunday, Azenor did not work that afternoon. Instead, he\r\ntook a book out under the trees, as he often did, and sat reading it,\r\nfrom the first sound of the Vesper bell, that came faintly across the\r\nfields, till the Angelus. All that time! He turned many a page, yet in\r\nthe end did not know what he had read. With his pencil he had traced\r\n"Lalie" upon every margin, and was saying it softly to himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother Sunday Azenor saw Lalie at mass--and again. Once he walked with\r\nher and showed her the short cut across the cotton-field. She was very\r\nglad that day, and told him she was going to work--her grandmother said\r\nshe might. She was going to hoe, up in the fields with Monsieur Le\r\nBl\xc3\xb4t\'s hands. He entreated her not to; and when she asked his reason,\r\nhe could not tell her, but turned and tore shyly and savagely at the\r\nelder-blossoms that grew along the fence.\r\n\r\nThen they stopped where she was going to cross the fence from the field\r\ninto the lane. He wanted to tell her that was his house which they\r\ncould see not far away; but he did not dare to, since he had fed her\r\nthere on the morning she was hungry.\r\n\r\n"An\' you say yo\' gran\'ma\'s goin\' to let you work? She keeps you f\'om\r\nworkin\', _donc_?" He wanted to question her about her grandmother, and\r\ncould think of no other way to begin.\r\n\r\n"Po\' ole grand\'m\xc3\xa8re!" she answered. "I don\' b\'lieve she know mos\' time\r\nw\'at she\'s doin\'. Sometime she say\' I aint no betta an\' one nigga, an\'\r\nshe fo\'ce me to work. Then she say she know I\'m goin\' be one canaille\r\nlike maman, an\' she make me set down still, like she would want to kill\r\nme if I would move. Her, she on\'y want\' to be out in the wood\', day an\'\r\nnight, day an\' night. She ain\' got her right head, po\' grand\'m\xc3\xa8re. I\r\nknow she ain\'t."\r\n\r\nLalie had spoken low and in jerks, as if every word gave her pain.\r\nAzenor could feel her distress as plainly as he saw it. He wanted to\r\nsay something to her--to do something for her. But her mere presence\r\nparalyzed him into inactivity--except his pulses, that beat like\r\nhammers when he was with her. Such a poor, shabby little thing as she\r\nwas, too!\r\n\r\n"I\'m goin\' to wait yere nex\' Sunday fo\' you, Lalie," he said, when\r\nthe fence was between them. And he thought he had said something very\r\ndaring.\r\n\r\nBut the next Sunday she did not come. She was neither at the appointed\r\nplace of meeting in the lane, nor was she at mass. Her absence--so\r\nunexpected--affected Azenor like a calamity. Late in the afternoon,\r\nwhen he could stand the trouble and bewilderment of it no longer, he\r\nwent and leaned over P\xc3\xa8re Antoine\'s fence. The priest was picking the\r\nslugs from his roses on the other side.\r\n\r\n"That young girl from the Bon-Dieu," said Azenor--"she was not at mass\r\nto-day. I suppose her grandmother has forgotten your warning."\r\n\r\n"No," answered the priest. "The child is ill, I hear. Butrand tells me\r\nshe has been ill for several days from overwork in the fields. I shall\r\ngo out to-morrow to see about her. I would go to-day, if I could."\r\n\r\n"The child is ill," was all Azenor heard or understood of P\xc3\xa8re\r\nAntoine\'s words. He turned and walked resolutely away, like one who\r\ndetermines suddenly upon action after meaningless hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe walked towards his home and past it, as if it were a spot that did\r\nnot concern him. He went on down the lane and into the wood where he\r\nhad seen Lalie disappear that day.\r\n\r\nHere all was shadow, for the sun had dipped too low in the west to send\r\na single ray through the dense foliage of the forest.\r\n\r\nNow that he found himself on the way to Lalie\'s home, he strove to\r\nunderstand why he had not gone there before. He often visited other\r\ngirls in the village and neighborhood,--why not have gone to her, as\r\nwell? The answer lay too deep in his heart for him to be more than\r\nhalf-conscious of it. Fear had kept him,--dread to see her desolate\r\nlife face to face. He did not know how he could bear it.\r\n\r\nBut now he was going to her at last. She was ill. He would stand upon\r\nthat dismantled porch that he could just remember. Doubtless Ma\'ame\r\nZidore would come out to know his will, and he would tell her that P\xc3\xa8re\r\nAntoine had sent to inquire how Mamzelle Lalie was. No! Why drag in\r\nP\xc3\xa8re Antoine? He would simply stand boldly and say, "Ma\'ame Zidore, I\r\nlearn that Lalie is ill. I have come to know if it is true, and to see\r\nher, if I may."\r\n\r\nWhen Azenor reached the cabin where Lalie dwelt, all sign of day had\r\nvanished. Dusk had fallen swiftly after the sunset. The moss that hung\r\nheavy from great live-oak branches was making fantastic silhouettes\r\nagainst the eastern sky that the big, round moon was beginning to\r\nlight. Off in the swamp beyond the bayou, hundreds of dismal voices\r\nwere droning a lullaby. Upon the hovel itself, a stillness like death\r\nrested.\r\n\r\nOftener than once Azenor tapped upon the door, which was closed as well\r\nas it could be, without obtaining a reply. He finally approached one\r\nof the small unglazed windows, in which coarse mosquito-netting had\r\nbeen fastened, and looked into the room.\r\n\r\nBy the moonlight slanting in he could see Lalie stretched upon a bed;\r\nbut of Ma\'ame Zidore there was no sign. "Lalie!" he called softly.\r\n"Lalie!"\r\n\r\nThe girl slightly moved her head upon the pillow. Then he boldly opened\r\nthe door and entered.\r\n\r\nUpon a wretched bed, over which was spread a cover of patched calico,\r\nLalie lay, her frail body only half concealed by the single garment\r\nthat was upon it. One hand was plunged beneath her pillow; the other,\r\nwhich was free, he touched. It was as hot as flame; so was her head. He\r\nknelt sobbing upon the floor beside her, and called her his love and\r\nhis soul. He begged her to speak a word to him,--to look at him. But\r\nshe only muttered disjointedly that the cotton was all turning to ashes\r\nin the fields, and the blades of the corn were in flames.\r\n\r\nIf he was choked with love and grief to see her so, he was moved by\r\nanger as well; rage against himself, against P\xc3\xa8re Antoine, against the\r\npeople upon the plantation and in the village, who had so abandoned\r\na helpless creature to misery and maybe death. Because she had been\r\nsilent--had not lifted her voice in complaint--they believed she\r\nsuffered no more than she could bear.\r\n\r\nBut surely the people could not be utterly without heart. There must be\r\none somewhere with the spirit of Christ. P\xc3\xa8re Antoine would tell him of\r\nsuch a one, and he would carry Lalie to her,--out of this atmosphere of\r\ndeath. He was in haste to be gone with her. He fancied every moment of\r\ndelay was a fresh danger threatening her life.\r\n\r\nHe folded the rude bed-cover over Lalie\'s naked limbs, and lifted her\r\nin his arms. She made no resistance. She seemed only loath to withdraw\r\nher hand from beneath the pillow. When she did, he saw that she held\r\nlightly but firmly clasped in her encircling fingers the pretty\r\nEaster-egg he had given her! He uttered a low cry of exultation as the\r\nfull significance of this came over him. If she had hung for hours upon\r\nhis neck telling him that she loved him, he could not have known it\r\nmore surely than by this sign. Azenor felt as if some mysterious bond\r\nhad all at once drawn them heart to heart and made them one.\r\n\r\nNo need now to go from door to door begging admittance for her. She was\r\nhis. She belonged to him. He knew now where her place was, whose roof\r\nmust shelter her, and whose arms protect her.\r\n\r\nSo Azenor, with his loved one in his arms, walked through the forest,\r\nsure-footed as a panther. Once, as he walked, he could hear in the\r\ndistance the weird chant which Ma\'ame Zidore was crooning--to the moon,\r\nmaybe--as she gathered her wood.\r\n\r\nOnce, where the water was trickling cool through rocks, he stopped to\r\nlave Lalie\'s hot cheeks and hands and forehead. He had not once touched\r\nhis lips to her. But now, when a sudden great fear came upon him\r\nbecause she did not know him, instinctively he pressed his lips upon\r\nhers that were parched and burning. He held them there till hers were\r\nsoft and pliant from the healthy moisture of his own.\r\n\r\nThen she knew him. She did not tell him so, but her stiffened fingers\r\nrelaxed their tense hold upon the Easter bauble. It fell to the ground\r\nas she twined her arm around his neck; and he understood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Stay close by her, Tranquiline," said Azenor, when he had laid Lalie\r\nupon his own couch at home. "I\'m goin\' for the doctor en\' for P\xc3\xa8re\r\nAntoine. Not because she is goin\' to die," he added hastily, seeing the\r\nawe that crept into the woman\'s face at mention of the priest. "She is\r\ngoin\' to live! Do you think I would let my wife die, Tranquiline?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOKA.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was a half-breed Indian girl, with hardly a rag to her back. To the\r\nladies of the Band of United Endeavor who questioned her, she said her\r\nname was Loka, and she did not know where she belonged, unless it was\r\non Bayou Choctaw.\r\n\r\nShe had appeared one day at the side door of Frobissaint\'s "oyster\r\nsaloon" in Natchitoches, asking for food. Frobissaint, a practical\r\nphilanthropist, engaged her on the spot as tumbler-washer.\r\n\r\nShe was not successful at that; she broke too many tumblers. But, as\r\nFrobissaint charged her with the broken glasses, he did not mind,\r\nuntil she began to break them over the heads of his customers. Then\r\nhe seized her by the wrist and dragged her before the Band of United\r\nEndeavor, then in session around the corner. This was considerate on\r\nFrobissaint\'s part, for he could have dragged her just as well to the\r\npolice station.\r\n\r\nLoka was not beautiful, as she stood in her red calico rags before\r\nthe scrutinizing band. Her coarse, black, unkempt hair framed a broad,\r\nswarthy face without a redeeming feature, except eyes that were not\r\nbad; slow in their movements, but frank eyes enough. She was big--boned\r\nand clumsy.\r\n\r\nShe did not know how old she was. The minister\'s wife reckoned she\r\nmight be sixteen. The judge\'s wife thought that it made no difference.\r\nThe doctor\'s wife suggested that the girl have a bath and change before\r\nshe be handled, even in discussion. The motion was not seconded. Loka\'s\r\nultimate disposal was an urgent and difficult consideration.\r\n\r\nSome one mentioned a reformatory. Every one else objected.\r\n\r\nMadame Laballi\xc3\xa8re, the planter\'s wife, knew a respectable family of\r\n\'Cadians living some miles below, who, she thought, would give the\r\ngirl a home, with benefit to all concerned. The \'Cadian woman was a\r\ndeserving one, with a large family of small children, who had all her\r\nown work to do. The husband cropped in a modest way. Loka would not\r\nonly be taught to work at the Padues\', but would receive a good moral\r\ntraining beside.\r\n\r\nThat settled it. Every one agreed with the planter\'s wife that it was\r\na chance in a thousand;-and Loka was sent to sit on the steps outside,\r\nwhile the band proceeded to the business next in order.\r\n\r\nLoka was afraid of treading upon the little Padues when she first got\r\namongst them,--there were so many of them,--and her feet were like\r\nleaden weights, encased in the strong brogans with which the band had\r\nequipped her.\r\n\r\nMadame Padue, a small, black-eyed, aggressive woman, questioned her in\r\na sharp, direct fashion peculiar to herself.\r\n\r\n"How come you don\'t talk French, you?" Loka shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"I kin talk English good \'s anybody; an\' lit\' bit Choctaw, too," she\r\noffered, apologetically.\r\n\r\n"_Ma foi_, you kin fo\'git yo\' Choctaw. Soona the betta for me. Now if\r\nyou wil-lin\', an\' ent too lazy an\' sassy, we \'ll git \'long somehow.\r\n_Vrai sauvage \xc3\xa7a_," she muttered under her breath, as she turned to\r\ninitiate Loka into some of her new duties.\r\n\r\nShe herself was a worker. A good deal more fussy one than her\r\neasy-going husband and children thought necessary or agreeable. Loka\'s\r\nslow ways and heavy motions aggravated her. It was in vain Monsieur\r\nPadue expostulated:--\r\n\r\n"She\'s on\'y a chile, rememba, Tontine."\r\n\r\n"She\'s _vrai sauvage_, that\'s w\'at. It\'s got to be work out of her,"\r\nwas Tontine\'s only reply to such remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe girl was indeed so deliberate about her tasks that she had\r\nto be urged constantly to accomplish the amount of labor that\r\nTontine required of her. Moreover, she carried to her work a stolid\r\nindifference that was exasperating. Whether at the wash-tub, scrubbing\r\nthe floors, weeding the garden, or learning her lessons and catechism\r\nwith the children on Sundays, it was the same.\r\n\r\nIt was only when intrusted with the care of little Bibine, the baby,\r\nthat Loka crept somewhat out of her apathy. She grew very fond of him.\r\nNo wonder; such a baby as he was! So good, so fat, and complaisant! He\r\nhad such, a way of clasping Loka\'s broad face between his pudgy fists\r\nand savagely biting her chin with his hard, toothless gums! Such a way\r\nof bouncing in her arms as if he were mounted upon springs! At his\r\nantics the girl would laugh a wholesome, ringing laugh that was good to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nShe was left alone to watch and nurse him one day. An accommodating\r\nneighbor who had become the possessor of a fine new spring wagon passed\r\nby just after the noon-hour meal, and offered to take the whole family\r\non a jaunt to town. The offer was all the more tempting as Tontine had\r\nsome long-delayed shopping to do; and the opportunity to equip the\r\nchildren with shoes and summer hats could not be slighted. So away they\r\nall went. All but Bibine, who was left swinging in his branle with only\r\nLoka for company.\r\n\r\nThis branle consisted of a strong circular piece of cotton cloth,\r\nsecurely but slackly fastened to a large, stout hoop suspended by three\r\nlight cords to a hook in a rafter of the gallery. The baby who has not\r\nswung in a branle does not know the quintessence of baby luxury. In\r\neach of the four rooms of the house was a hook from which to hang this\r\nswing.\r\n\r\nOften it was taken out under the trees. But to-day it swung in the\r\nshade of the open gallery; and Loka sat beside it, giving it now and\r\nthen a slight impetus that sent it circling in slow, sleep-inspiring\r\nundulations.\r\n\r\nBibine kicked and cooed as long as he was able. But Loka was humming\r\na monotonous lullaby; the branle was swaying to and fro, the warm air\r\nfanning him deliciously; and Bibine was soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, Loka quietly let down the mosquito net, to protect the\r\nchild\'s slumber from the intrusion of the many insects that were\r\nswarming in the summer air.\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, there was no work for her to do; and Tontine, in\r\nher hurried departure, had failed to provide for the emergency. The\r\nwashing and ironing were over; the floors had been scrubbed, and the\r\nrooms righted; the yard swept; the chickens fed; vegetables picked and\r\nwashed. There was absolutely nothing to do, and Loka gave herself up to\r\nthe dreams of idleness.\r\n\r\nAs she sat comfortably back in the roomy rocker, she let her eyes\r\nsweep lazily across the country. Away off to the right peeped up, from\r\namid densely clustered trees, the pointed roofs and long pipe of the\r\nsteam-gin of Laballi\xc3\xa8re\'s. No other habitation was visible except a few\r\nlow, flat dwellings far over the river, that could hardly be seen.\r\n\r\nThe immense plantation took up all the land in sight. The few acres\r\nthat Baptiste Padue cultivated were his own, that Laballi\xc3\xa8re, out\r\nof friendly consideration, had sold to him. Baptiste\'s fine crop of\r\ncotton and corn was "laid by" just now, waiting for rain; and Baptiste\r\nhad gone with the rest of the family to town. Beyond the river and the\r\nfield and everywhere about were dense woods.\r\n\r\nLoka\'s gaze, that had been slowly traveling along the edge of the\r\nhorizon, finally fastened upon the woods, and stayed there. Into her\r\neyes came the absent look of one whose thought is projected into the\r\nfuture or the past, leaving the present blank. She was seeing a vision.\r\nIt had come with a whiff that the strong south breeze had blown to her\r\nfrom the woods.\r\n\r\nShe was seeing old Marot, the squaw who drank whiskey and plaited\r\nbaskets and beat her. There was something, after all, in being beaten,\r\nif only to scream out and fight back, as at that time in Natchitoches,\r\nwhen she broke a glass on the head of a man who laughed at her and\r\npulled her hair, and called her "fool names."\r\n\r\nOld Marot wanted her to steal and cheat, to beg and lie, when they\r\nwent out with the baskets to sell. Loka did not want to. She did not\r\nlike to. That was why she had run away--and because she was beaten.\r\nBut--but ah! the scent of the sassafras leaves hanging to dry in\r\nthe shade! The pungent, camomile! The sound of the bayou tumbling\r\nover that old slimy log! Only to lie there for hours and watch the\r\nglistening lizards glide in and out was worth a beating.\r\n\r\nShe knew the birds must be singing in chorus out there in the woods\r\nwhere the gray moss was hanging, and the trumpet-vine trailing from the\r\ntrees, spangled with blossoms. In spirit she heard the songsters.\r\n\r\nShe wondered if Choctaw Joe and Sambite played dice every night by\r\nthe camp-fire as they used to do; and if they still fought and\r\nslashed each other when wild with drink. How good it felt to walk with\r\nmoccasined feet over the springy turf, under the trees! What fun to\r\ntrap the squirrels, to skin the otter; to take those swift flights on\r\nthe pony that Choctaw Joe had stolen from the Texans!\r\n\r\nLoka sat motionless; only her breast heaved tumultuously. Her heart was\r\naching with savage homesickness. She could not feel just then that the\r\nsin and pain of that life were anything beside the joy of its freedom.\r\n\r\nLoka was sick for the woods. She felt she must die if she could not get\r\nback to them, and to her vagabond life. Was there anything to hinder\r\nher? She stooped and unlaced the brogans that were chafing her feet,\r\nremoved them and her stockings, and threw the things away from her. She\r\nstood up all a-quiver, panting, ready for flight.\r\n\r\nBut there was a sound that stopped her. It was little Bibine, cooing,\r\nsputtering, battling hands and feet with the mosquito net that he had\r\ndragged over his face. The girl uttered a sob as she reached down for\r\nthe baby she had grown to love so, and clasped him in her arms. She\r\ncould not go and leave Bibine behind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTontine began to grumble at once when she discovered that Loka was not\r\nat hand to receive them on their return.\r\n\r\n"_Bon!_" she exclaimed. "Now w\'ere is that Loka? Ah, that girl, she\r\naggravates me too much. Firs\' thing she knows I\'m goin\' sen\' her\r\nstraight back to them ban\' of lady w\'ere she come frum."\r\n\r\n"Loka!" she called, in short, sharp tones, as she traversed the house\r\nand peered into each room. "Lo--ka!" She cried loudly enough to be\r\nheard half a mile away when she got out upon the back gallery. Again\r\nand again she called.\r\n\r\nBaptiste was exchanging the discomfort of his Sunday coat for the\r\naccustomed ease of shirt sleeves.\r\n\r\n"_Mais_ don\'t git so excite, Tontine," he implored. "I\'m sho she\'s\r\nyonda to the crib shellin\' co\'n, or somew\'ere like that."\r\n\r\n"Run, Fran\xc3\xa7ois, you, an\' see to the crib," the mother commanded.\r\n"Bibine mus\' be starve! Run to the hen-house an\' look, Juliette. Maybe\r\nshe\'s fall asleep in some corna. That \'ll learn me \'notha time to go\r\ntrus\' _une pareille sauvage_ with my baby, _va!_"\r\n\r\nWhen it was discovered that Loka was nowhere in the immediate vicinity,\r\nTontine was furious.\r\n\r\n"_Pas possible_ she\'s walk to Laballi\xc3\xa8re, with Bibine!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll saddle the hoss an\' go see, Tontine," interposed Baptiste, who\r\nwas beginning to share his wife\'s uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"Go, go, Baptiste," she urged. "An\' you, boys, run yonda down the road\r\nto ole Aunt Judy\'s cabin an\' see."\r\n\r\nIt was found that Loka had not been seen at Laballi\xc3\xa8re\'s, nor at Aunt\r\nJudy\'s cabin; that she had not taken the boat, that was still fastened\r\nto its moorings down the bank. Then Tontine\'s excitement left her. She\r\nturned pale and sat quietly down in her room, with an unnatural calm\r\nthat frightened the children.\r\n\r\nSome of them began to cry. Baptiste walked restlessly about, anxiously\r\nscanning the country in all directions. A wretched hour dragged by. The\r\nsun had set, leaving hardly an afterglow, and in a little while the\r\ntwilight that falls so swiftly would be there.\r\n\r\nBaptiste was preparing to mount his horse, to start out again on the\r\nround he had already been over. Tontine sat in the same state of\r\nintense abstraction when Francois, who had perched himself among the\r\nlofty branches of a chinaberry-tree, called out: "Ent that Loka \'way\r\nyon\'a, jis\' come out de wood? climbin\' de fence down by de melon patch?"\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to distinguish in the gathering dusk if the figure\r\nwere that of man or beast. But the family was not left long in\r\nsuspense. Baptiste sped his horse away in the direction indicated by\r\nFrancis, and in a little while he was galloping back with Bibine in his\r\narms; as fretful, sleepy and hungry a baby as ever was.\r\n\r\nLoka came trudging on behind Baptiste. He did not wait for\r\nexplanations; he was too eager to place the child in the arms of\r\nits mother. The suspense over, Tontine began to cry; that followed\r\nnaturally, of course. Through her tears she managed to address Loka,\r\nwho stood all tattered and disheveled in the doorway: "W\'ere you been?\r\nTell me that."\r\n\r\n"Bibine an\' me," answered Loka, slowly and awkwardly, "we was\r\nlonesome--we been take lit\' \'broad in de wood."\r\n\r\n"You did n\' know no betta \'an to take \'way Bibine like that? W\'at\r\nMa\'ame Laballi\xc3\xa8re mean, anyhow, to sen\' me such a objec\' like you, I\r\nwant to know?"\r\n\r\n"You go\'n\' sen\' me \'way?" asked Loka, passing her hand in a hopeless\r\nfashion over her frowzy hair.\r\n\r\n"_Par exemple!_ straight you march back to that ban\' w\'ere you come\r\nfrom. To give me such a fright like that! _pas possible_."\r\n\r\n"Go slow, Tontine; go slow," interposed Baptiste.\r\n\r\n"Don\' sen\' me \'way frum Bibine," entreated the girl, with a note in her\r\nvoice like a lament.\r\n\r\n"To-day," she went on, in her dragging manner, "I want to run \'way bad,\r\nan\' take to de wood; an\' go yonda back to Bayou Choctaw to steal an\'\r\nlie agin. It\'s on\'y Bibine w\'at hole me back. I could n\' lef\' \'im. I\r\ncould n\' do dat. An\' we jis\' go take lit\' \'broad in de wood, das all,\r\nhim an\' me. Don\' sen\' me \'way like dat!"\r\n\r\nBaptiste led the girl gently away to the far end of the gallery, and\r\nspoke soothingly to her. He told her to be good and brave, and he would\r\nright the trouble for her. He left her standing there and went back to\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n"Tontine," he began, with unusual energy, "you got to listen to the\r\ntruth--once fo\' all." He had evidently determined to profit by his\r\nwife\'s lachrymose and wilted condition to assert his authority.\r\n\r\n"I want to say who\'s masta in this house--it\'s me," he went on.\r\nTontine did not protest; only clasped the baby a little closer, which\r\nencouraged him to proceed.\r\n\r\n"You been grind that girl too much. She ent a bad girl--I been watch\r\nher close, \'count of the chil\'ren; she ent bad. All she want, it\'s\r\nli\'le mo\' rope. You can\'t drive a ox with the same gearin\' you drive a\r\nmule. You got to learn that, Tontine."\r\n\r\nHe approached his wife\'s chair and stood beside her.\r\n\r\n"That girl, she done tole us how she was temp\' to-day to turn\r\n_canaille_--like we all temp\' sometime\'. W\'at was it save her? That\r\nli\'le chile w\'at you hole in yo\' arm. An\' now you want to take her\r\nguarjun angel \'way f\'om her? _Non, non, ma femme_," he said, resting\r\nhis hand gently upon his wife\'s head. "We got to rememba she ent like\r\nyou an\' me, po\' thing; she\'s one Injun, her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUL\xc3\x94T AND BOULOTTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Boul\xc3\xb4t and Boulotte, the little piny-wood twins, had reached the\r\ndignified age of twelve, it was decided in family council that the\r\ntime had come for them to put their little naked feet into shoes. They\r\nwere two brown-skinned, black-eyed \'Cadian roly-polies, who lived\r\nwith father and mother and a troop of brothers and sisters halfway up\r\nthe hill, in a neat log cabin that had a substantial mud chimney at\r\none end. They could well afford shoes now, for they had saved many a\r\npicayune through their industry of selling wild grapes, blackberries,\r\nand "socoes" to ladies in the village who "put up" such things.\r\n\r\nBoul\xc3\xb4t and Boulotte were to buy the shoes themselves, and they selected\r\na Saturday afternoon for the important transaction, for that is the\r\ngreat shopping time in Natchitoches Parish. So upon a bright Saturday\r\nafternoon Boul\xc3\xb4t and Boulotte, hand in hand, with their quarters, their\r\ndimes, and their picayunes tied carefully in a Sunday handkerchief,\r\ndescended the hill, and disappeared from the gaze of the eager group\r\nthat had assembled to see them go.\r\n\r\nLong before it was time for their return, this same small band, with\r\nten year old Seraphine at their head, holding a tiny Seraphin in\r\nher arms, had stationed themselves in a row before the cabin at a\r\nconvenient point from which to make quick and careful observation.\r\n\r\nEven before the two could be caught sight of, their chattering voices\r\nwere heard down by the spring, where they had doubtless stopped to\r\ndrink. The voices grew more and more audible. Then, through the\r\nbranches of the young pines, Boulotte\'s blue sun-bonnet appeared, and\r\nBoul\xc3\xb4t\'s straw hat. Finally the twins, hand in hand, stepped into the\r\nclearing in full view.\r\n\r\nConsternation seized the band.\r\n\r\n"You bof crazy _donc_, Boul\xc3\xb4t an\' Boulotte," screamed Seraphine. "You\r\ngo buy shoes, an\' come home barefeet like you was go!"\r\n\r\nBoul\xc3\xb4t flushed crimson. He silently hung his head, and looked\r\nsheepishly down at his bare feet, then at the fine stout brogans that\r\nhe carried in his hand. He had not thought of it.\r\n\r\nBoulotte also carried shoes, but of the glossiest, with the highest of\r\nheels and brightest of buttons. But she was not one to be disconcerted\r\nor to look sheepish; far from it.\r\n\r\n"You \'spec\' Boul\xc3\xb4t an\' me we got money fur was\'e--us?" she retorted,\r\nwith withering condescension. "You think we go buy shoes fur ruin it in\r\nde dus\'? _Comment!_"\r\n\r\nAnd they all walked into the house crest-fallen; all but Boulotte, who\r\nwas mistress of the situation, and Seraphin, who did not care one way\r\nor the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR MARSE CHOUCHOUTE\r\n\r\n\r\n"An\' now, young man, w\'at you want to remember is this--an\' take it\r\nfer yo\' motto: \'No monkey-shines with Uncle Sam.\' You undastan\'? You\r\naware now o\' the penalties attached to monkey-shinin\' with Uncle Sam.\r\nI reckon that\'s \'bout all I got to say; so you be on han\' promp\'\r\nto-morrow mornin\' at seven o\'clock, to take charge o\' the United States\r\nmail-bag."\r\n\r\nThis formed the close of a very pompous address delivered by the\r\npostmaster of Cloutier ville to young Armand Verchette, who had been\r\nappointed to carry the mails from the village to the railway station\r\nthree miles away.\r\n\r\nArmand--or Chouchoute, as every one chose to call him, following the\r\nhabit of the Creoles in giving nicknames--had heard the man a little\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nNot so the negro boy who accompanied him. The child had listened with\r\nthe deepest respect and awe to every word of the rambling admonition.\r\n\r\n"How much you gwine git, Marse Chouchoute?" he asked, as they walked\r\ndown the village street together, the black boy a little behind. He\r\nwas very black, and slightly deformed; a small boy, scarcely reaching\r\nto the shoulder of his companion, whose cast-off garments he wore. But\r\nChouchoute was tall for his sixteen years, and carried himself well.\r\n\r\n"W\'y, I\'m goin\' to git thirty dolla\' a month, Wash; w\'at you say to\r\nthat? Betta \'an hoein\' cotton, ain\'t it?" He laughed with a triumphant\r\nring in his voice.\r\n\r\nBut Wash did not laugh; he was too much impressed by the importance of\r\nthis new function, too much bewildered by the vision of sudden wealth\r\nwhich thirty dollars a month meant to his understanding.\r\n\r\nHe felt, too, deeply conscious of the great weight of responsibility\r\nwhich this new office brought with it. The imposing salary had\r\nconfirmed the impression left by the postmaster\'s words.\r\n\r\n"_You_ gwine git all dat money? Sakes! W\'at you reckon Ma\'ame Verchette\r\nsay? I know she gwine mos\' take a fit w\'en she heah dat."\r\n\r\nBut Chouchoute\'s mother did not "mos\' take a fit" when she heard of\r\nher son\'s good fortune. The white and wasted hand which she rested\r\nupon the boy\'s black curls trembled a little, it is true, and tears of\r\nemotion came into her tired eyes. This step seemed to her the beginning\r\nof better things for her fatherless boy.\r\n\r\nThey lived quite at the end of this little French village, which was\r\nsimply two long rows of very old frame houses, facing each other\r\nclosely across a dusty roadway.\r\n\r\nTheir home was a cottage, so small and so humble that it just escaped\r\nthe reproach of being a cabin.\r\n\r\nEvery one was kind to Madame Verchette. Neighbors ran in of mornings to\r\nhelp her with her work--she could do so little for herself. And often\r\nthe good priest, P\xc3\xa8re Antoine, came to sit with her and talk innocent\r\ngossip.\r\n\r\nTo say that Wash was fond of Madame Verchette and her son is to be\r\npoor in language to express devotion. He worshiped her as if she were\r\nalready an angel in Paradise.\r\n\r\nChouchoute was a delightful young fellow; no one could help loving\r\nhim. His heart was as warm and cheery as his own southern sunbeams.\r\nIf he was born with an unlucky trick of forgetfulness--or better,\r\nthoughtlessness--no one ever felt much like blaming him for it, so much\r\ndid it seem a part of his happy, careless nature. And why was that\r\nfaithful watch-dog, Wash, always at Marse Chouchoute\'s heels, if it\r\nwere not to be hands and ears and eyes to him, more than half the time?\r\n\r\nOne beautiful spring night, Chouchoute, on his way to the station, was\r\nriding along the road that skirted the river. The clumsy mail-bag that\r\nlay before him across the pony was almost empty; for the Cloutierville\r\nmail was a meagre and unimportant one at best.\r\n\r\nBut he did not know this. He was not thinking of the mail, in fact; he\r\nwas only feeling that life was very agreeable this delicious spring\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThere were cabins at intervals upon the road--most of them darkened,\r\nfor the hour was late. As he approached one of these, which was more\r\npretentious than the others, he heard the sound of a fiddle, and saw\r\nlights through the openings of the house.\r\n\r\nIt was so far from the road that when he stopped his horse and peered\r\nthrough the darkness he could not recognize the dancers who passed\r\nbefore the open doors and windows. But he knew this was Gros-L\xc3\xa9on\'s\r\nball, which he had heard the boys talking about all the week.\r\n\r\nWhy should he not go and stand in the doorway an instant and exchange a\r\nword with the dancers?\r\n\r\nChouchoute dismounted, fastened his horse to the fence-post, and\r\nproceeded towards the house.\r\n\r\nThe room, crowded with people young and old, was long and low, with\r\nrough beams across the ceiling, blackened by smoke and time. Upon the\r\nhigh mantelpiece a single coal-oil lamp burned, and none too brightly.\r\n\r\nIn a far corner, upon a platform of boards laid across two flour\r\nbarrels, sat Uncle Ben, playing upon a squeaky fiddle, and shouting the\r\n"figures."\r\n\r\n"Ah! _v\'l\xc3\xa0_ Chouchoute!" some one called.\r\n\r\n"Eh! Chouchoute!"\r\n\r\n"Jus\' in time, Chouchoute; yere\'s Miss L\xc3\xa9ontine waitin\' fer a partna."\r\n\r\n"S\'lute yo\' partnas!" Uncle Ben was thundering forth; and Chouchoute,\r\nwith one hand gracefully behind him, made a profound bow to Miss\r\nL\xc3\xa9ontine, as he offered her the other.\r\n\r\nNow Chouchoute was noted far and wide for his skill as a dancer. The\r\nmoment he stood upon the floor, a fresh spirit seemed to enter into all\r\npresent. It was with renewed vigor that Uncle Ben intoned his "Balancy\r\nall! Fus\' fo\' fo\'ard an\' back!"\r\n\r\nThe spectators drew close about the couples to watch Chouchoute\'s\r\nwonderful performance; his pointing of toes; his pigeonwings in which\r\nhis feet seemed hardly to touch the floor.\r\n\r\n"It take Chouchoute to show \'em de step, _va!_" proclaimed Gros-L\xc3\xa9on,\r\nwith a fat satisfaction, to the audience at large.\r\n\r\n"Look \'im; look \'im yonda! Ole Ben got to work hard\' \'an dat, if he\r\nwant to keep up wid Chouchoute, I tell you!".\r\n\r\nSo it was; encouragement and adulation on all sides, till, from the\r\npraise that was showered on him, Chouchoute\'s head was soon as light as\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nAt the windows appeared the dusky faces of negroes, their bright eyes\r\ngleaming as they viewed the scene within and mingled their loud guffaws\r\nwith the medley of sound that was already deafening.\r\n\r\nThe time was speeding. The air was heavy in the room, but no one seemed\r\nto mind this. Uncle Ben was calling the figures now with a rhythmic\r\nsing-song:--\r\n\r\n"Right an\' lef\' all \'roun\'! Swing co\'nas!"\r\n\r\nChouchoute turned with a smile to Miss F\xc3\xa9licie on his left, his hand\r\nextended, when what should break upon his ear but the long, harrowing\r\nwail of a locomotive!\r\n\r\nBefore the sound ceased he had vanished from the room. Miss F\xc3\xa9licie\r\nstood as he left her, with hand uplifted, rooted to the spot with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nIt was the train whistling for his station, and he a mile and more\r\naway! He knew he was too late, and that he could not make the distance;\r\nbut the sound had been a rude reminder that he was not at his post of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nHowever, he would do what he could now. He ran swiftly to the outer\r\nroad, and to the spot where he had left his pony.\r\n\r\nThe horse was gone, and with it the United States mail-bag!\r\n\r\nFor an instant Chouchoute stood half-stunned with terror. Then, in one\r\nquick flash, came to his mind a vision of possibilities that sickened\r\nhim. Disgrace overtaking him in this position of trust; poverty his\r\nportion again; and his dear mother forced to share both with him.\r\n\r\nHe turned desperately to some negroes who had followed him, seeing his\r\nwild rush from the house:--\r\n\r\n"Who saw my hoss? W\'at you all did with my hoss, say?"\r\n\r\n"Who you reckon tech yo\' hoss, boy?" grumbled Gustave, a sullen-looking\r\nmulatto. "You did n\'have no call to lef\' \'im in de road, fus\' place."\r\n\r\n"\'Pear to me like I heahed a hoss a-lopin\' down de road jis\' now; did\r\nn\' you, Uncle Jake?" ventured a second.\r\n\r\n"Neva heahed nuttin\'--nuttin\' \'t all, \'cep\' dat big-mouf Ben yon da\r\nmakin\' mo\' fuss \'an a t\'unda-sto\'m."\r\n\r\n"Boys!" cried Chouchoute, excitedly, "bring me a hoss, quick, one of\r\nyou. I\'m boun\' to have one! I\'m boun\' to! I \'ll give two dolla\' to the\r\nfirs\' man brings me a hoss."\r\n\r\nNear at hand, in the "lot" that adjoined Uncle Jake\'s cabin, was his\r\nlittle creole pony, nibbling the cool, wet grass that he found, along\r\nthe edges and in the corners of the fence.\r\n\r\nThe negro led the pony forth. With no further word, and with one bound,\r\nChouchoute was upon the animal\'s back. He wanted neither saddle nor\r\nbridle, for there were few horses in the neighborhood that had not been\r\ntrained to be guided by the simple motions of a rider\'s body.\r\n\r\nOnce mounted, he threw himself forward with a certain violent impulse,\r\nleaning till his cheek touched the animal\'s mane.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a sharp "Hei!" and at once, as if possessed by sudden\r\nfrenzy, the horse dashed forward, leaving the bewildered black men in a\r\ncloud of dust.\r\n\r\nWhat a mad ride it was! On one side was the river bank, steep in places\r\nand crumbling away; on the other, an unbroken line of fencing; now in\r\nstraight lines of neat planking, now treacherous barbed wire, sometimes\r\nthe zigzag rail.\r\n\r\nThe night was black, with only such faint light as the stars were\r\nshedding. No sound was to be heard save the quick thud of the horse\'s\r\nhoofs upon the hard dirt road, the animal\'s heavy breathing, and the\r\nboy\'s feverish "hei-hei!" when he fancied the speed slackened.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a marauding dog started from the obscurity to bark and\r\ngive useless chase.\r\n\r\n"To the road, to the road, Bon-\xc3\xa0-rien!" panted Chouchoute, for the\r\nhorse in his wild race had approached so closely to the river\'s edge\r\nthat the bank crumbled beneath his flying feet. It was only by a\r\ndesperate lunge and bound that he saved himself and rider from plunging\r\ninto the water below.\r\n\r\nChouchoute hardly knew what he was pursuing so madly. It was rather\r\nsomething that drove him; fear, hope, desperation.\r\n\r\nHe was rushing to the station, because it seemed to him, naturally,\r\nthe first thing to do. There was the faint hope that his own horse had\r\nbroken rein and gone there of his own accord; but such hope was almost\r\nlost in a wretched conviction that had seized him the instant he saw\r\n"Gustave the thief" among the men gathered at Gros-L\xc3\xa9on\'s. "Hei! hei,\r\nBon-\xc3\xa0-rien!"\r\n\r\nThe lights of the railway station were gleaming ahead, and Chouchoute\'s\r\nhot ride was almost at an end.\r\n\r\nWith sudden and strange perversity of purpose, Chouchoute, as he drew\r\ncloser upon the station, slackened his horse\'s speed. A low fence was\r\nin his way. Not long before, he would have cleared it at a bound, for\r\nBon-\xc3\xa0-rien could do such things. Now he cantered easily to the end of\r\nit, to go through the gate which was there.\r\n\r\nHis courage was growing faint, and his heart sinking within him as he\r\ndrew nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nHe dismounted, and holding the pony by the mane, approached with some\r\ntrepidation the young station-master, who was taking note of some\r\nfreight that had been deposited near the tracks.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hudson," faltered Chouchoute, "did you see my pony \'roun\' yere\r\nanywhere? an\'--an\' the mail-sack?"\r\n\r\n"Your pony\'s safe in the woods, Chou\'te. The mail-bag\'s on its way to\r\nNew Orleans"--\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" breathed the boy.\r\n\r\n"But that poor little fool darkey of yours has about done it for\r\nhimself, I guess."\r\n\r\n"Wash? Oh, Mr. Hudson! w\'at\'s--w\'at\'s happen\' to Wash?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s inside there, on my mattress. He\'s hurt, and he\'s hurt bad;\r\nthat\'s what\'s the matter. You see the ten forty-five had come in, and\r\nshe did n\'t make much of a stop; she was just pushing out, when bless\r\nme if that little chap of yours didn\'t come tearing along on Spunky as\r\nif Old Harry was behind him.\r\n\r\n"You know how No. 22 can pull at the start; and there was that little\r\nimp keeping abreast of her \'most under the thing\'s wheels.\r\n\r\n"I shouted at him. I could n\'t make out what he was up to, when blamed\r\nif he did n\'t pitch the mail-bag clean into the car! Buffalo Bill could\r\nn\'t have done it neater.\r\n\r\n"Then Spunky, she shied; and Wash he bounced against the side of that\r\ncar and back, like a rubber ball, and laid in the ditch till we carried\r\nhim inside.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve wired down the road for Doctor Campbell to come up on 14 and do\r\nwhat he can for him."\r\n\r\nHudson had related these events to the distracted boy while they made\r\ntheir way toward the house.\r\n\r\nInside, upon a low pallet, lay the little negro, breathing heavily, his\r\nblack face pinched and ashen with approaching death. He had wanted no\r\none to touch him further than to lay him upon the bed.\r\n\r\nThe few men and colored women gathered in the room were looking upon\r\nhim with pity mingled with curiosity.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Chouchoute he closed his eyes, and a shiver passed through\r\nhis small frame. Those about him thought he was dead. Chouchoute\r\nknelt, choking, at his side and held his hand.\r\n\r\n"O Wash, Wash! W\'at you did that for? W\'at made you, Wash?"\r\n\r\n"Marse Chouchoute," the boy whispered, so low that no one could\r\nhear him but his friend, "I was gwine \'long de big road, pas\' Marse\r\nGros-L\xc3\xa9on\'s, an\' I seed Spunky tied dah wid de mail. Dar warn\'t a\r\nminute--I \'clar\', Marse Chouchoute, dar warn\'t a minute--to fotch you.\r\nW\'at makes my head tu\'n \'roun\' dat away?"\r\n\r\n"Neva mine, Wash; keep still; don\'t you try to talk," entreated\r\nChouchoute.\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t mad, Marse Chouchoute?"\r\n\r\nThe lad could only answer with a hand pressure.\r\n\r\n"Dar warn\'t a minute, so I gits top o\' Spunky--I neva seed nuttin\'\r\nd\'ar de road like dat. I come \'long side--de train--an\' fling de sack.\r\nI seed \'im kotch it, and I don\' know nuttin\' mo\' \'cep\' mis\'ry, tell I\r\nsee you--a-comin\' frough de do\'. Mebby Ma\'ame Armand know some\'pin,"\r\nhe murmured faintly, "w\'at gwine make my--head quit tu\'nin\' \'round dat\r\naway. I boun\' to git well, \'ca\'se who--gwine--watch Marse--Chouchoute?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO AVOYELLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one who came up from Avoyelles had the same story to tell of\r\nMentine. _Cher Ma\xc3\xaetre!_ but she was changed. And there were babies,\r\nmore than she could well manage; as good as four already. Jules was not\r\nkind except to himself. They seldom went to church, and never anywhere\r\nupon a visit. They lived as poorly as pine-woods people. Doudouce had\r\nheard the story often, the last time no later than that morning.\r\n\r\n"Ho-a!" he shouted to his mule plumb in the middle of the cotton row.\r\nHe had staggered along behind the plow since early morning, and of a\r\nsudden he felt he had had enough of it. He mounted the mule and rode\r\naway to the stable, leaving the plow with its polished blade thrust\r\ndeep in the red Cane River soil. His head felt like a windmill with\r\nthe recollections and sudden intentions that had crowded it and were\r\nwhirling through his brain since he had heard the last story about\r\nMentine.\r\n\r\nHe knew well enough Mentine would have married him seven years ago had\r\nnot Jules Trodon come up from Avoyelles and captivated her with his\r\nhandsome eyes and pleasant speech. Doudouce was resigned then, for he\r\nheld Mentine\'s happiness above his own. But now she was suffering in\r\na hopeless, common, exasperating way for the small comforts of life.\r\nPeople had told him so. And somehow, to-day, he could not stand the\r\nknowledge passively. He felt he must see those things they spoke of\r\nwith his own eyes. He must strive to help her and her children if it\r\nwere possible.\r\n\r\nDoudouce could not sleep that night. He lay with wakeful eyes watching\r\nthe moonlight creep across the bare floor of his room; listening to\r\nsounds that seemed unfamiliar and weird down among the rushes along\r\nthe bayou. But towards morning he saw Mentine as he had seen her last\r\nin her white wedding gown and veil. She looked at him with appealing\r\neyes and held out her arms for protection,--for, rescue, it seemed to\r\nhim. That dream determined him. The following day Doudouce started for\r\nAvoyelles.\r\n\r\nJules Trodon\'s home lay a mile or two from Marksville. It consisted\r\nof three rooms strung in a row and opening upon a narrow gallery.\r\nThe whole wore an aspect of poverty and dilapidation that summer day,\r\ntowards noon, when Doudouce approached it. His presence outside the\r\ngate aroused the frantic barking of dogs that dashed down the steps as\r\nif to attack him. Two little brown barefooted children, a boy and girl,\r\nstood upon the gallery staring stupidly at him. "Call off you\' dogs,"\r\nhe requested; but they only continued to stare.\r\n\r\n"Down, Pluto! down, Achille!" cried the shrill voice of a woman who\r\nemerged from the house, holding upon her arm a delicate baby of a year\r\nor two. There was only an instant of unrecognition.\r\n\r\n"_Mais_ Doudouce, that ent you, _comment!_ Well, if any one would tole\r\nme this mornin\'! Git a chair, \'Tit Jules. That\'s Mista Doudouce, f\'om\r\n\'way yonda Natchitoches w\'ere yo\' maman use\' to live. _Mais_, you ent\r\nchange\'; you\' lookin\' well, Doudouce."\r\n\r\nHe shook hands in a slow, undemonstrative way, and seated himself\r\nclumsily upon the hide-bottomed chair, laying his broad-rimmed felt\r\nhat upon the floor beside him. He was very uncomfortable in the cloth\r\nSunday coat which he wore.\r\n\r\n"I had business that call\' me to Marksville," he began, "an\' I say to\r\nmyse\'f, \'_Tiens_, you can\'t pass by without tell\' \'em all howdy.\'"\r\n\r\n"_Par exemple!_ w\'at Jules would said to that! _Mais_, you\' lookin\'\r\nwell; you ent change\', Doudouce."\r\n\r\n"An\' you\' lookin\' well, Mentine, Jis\' the same Mentine." He regretted\r\nthat he lacked talent to make the lie bolder.\r\n\r\nShe moved a little uneasily, and felt upon her shoulder for a pin with\r\nwhich to fasten the front of her old gown where it lacked a button. She\r\nhad kept the baby in her lap. Doudouce was wondering miserably if he\r\nwould have known her outside her home. He would have known her sweet,\r\ncheerful brown eyes, that were not changed; but her figure, that had\r\nlooked so trim in the wedding gown, was sadly misshapen. She was brown,\r\nwith skin like parchment, and piteously thin. There were lines, some\r\ndeep as if old age had cut them, about the eyes and mouth.\r\n\r\n"An\' how you lef\' \'em all, yonda?" she asked, in a high voice that had\r\ngrown shrill from screaming at children and dogs.\r\n\r\n"They all well. It\'s mighty li\'le sickness in the country this yea\'.\r\nBut they been lookin\' fo\' you up yonda, straight along, Mentine."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk, Doudouce, it\'s no chance; with that po\' we\' out piece o\'\r\nlan\' w\'at Jules got. He say, anotha yea\' like that, he\'s goin\' sell\r\nout, him."\r\n\r\nThe children were clutching her on either side, their persistent gaze\r\nalways fastened upon Doudouce. He tried without avail to make friends\r\nwith them. Then Jules came home from the field, riding the mule with\r\nwhich he had worked, and which he fastened outside the gate.\r\n\r\n"Yere\'s Doudouce f\'om Natchitoches, Jules," called out Mentine, "he\r\nstop\' to tell us howdy, _en passant_." The husband mounted to the\r\ngallery and the two men shook hands; Doudouce listlessly, as he had\r\ndone with Mentine; Jules with some bluster and show of cordiality.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\' a lucky man, you," he exclaimed with his swagger air, "able\r\nto broad like that, _encore!_ You could n\'t do that if you had half a\r\ndozen mouth\' to feed, _allez!_"\r\n\r\n"Non, j\'te garantis!" agreed Mentine, with a loud laugh. Doudouce\r\nwinced, as he had done the instant before at Jules\'s heartless\r\nimplication. This husband of Mentine surely had not changed during the\r\nseven years, except to grow broader, stronger, handsomer. But Doudouce\r\ndid not tell him so.\r\n\r\nAfter the mid-day dinner of boiled salt pork, corn bread and molasses,\r\nthere was nothing for Doudouce but to take his leave when Jules did.\r\n\r\nAt the gate, the little boy was discovered in dangerous proximity to\r\nthe mule\'s heels, and was properly screamed at and rebuked.\r\n\r\n"I reckon he likes hosses," Doudouce remarked. "He take\' afta you,\r\nMentine. I got a li\'le pony yonda home," he said, addressing the child,\r\n"w\'at ent ne use to me. I\'m goin\' sen\' \'im down to you. He\'s a good,\r\ntough li\'le mustang. You jis can let \'im eat grass an\' feed \'im a\r\nban\'ful \'o co\'n, once a w\'ile. An\' he\'s gentle, yes. You an\' yo\' ma can\r\nride \'im to church, Sundays. _Hein!_ you want?"\r\n\r\n"W\'at you say, Jules?" demanded the father. "W\'at you say?" echoed\r\nMentine, who was balancing the baby across the gate.\r\n\r\n"\'Tit sauvage, va!"\r\n\r\nDoudouce shook hands all around, even with the baby, and walked off\r\nin the opposite direction to Jules, who had mounted the mule. He was\r\nbewildered. He stumbled over the rough ground because of tears that\r\nwere blinding him, and that he had held in check for the past hour.\r\n\r\nHe had loved Mentine long ago, when she was young and attractive, and\r\nhe found that he loved her still. He had tried to put all disturbing\r\nthought of her away, on that wedding-day, and he supposed he had\r\nsucceeded. But he loved her now as he never had. Because she was no\r\nlonger beautiful, he loved her. Because the delicate bloom of her\r\nexistence had been rudely brushed away; because she was in a manner\r\nfallen; because she was Mentine, he loved her; fiercely, as a mother\r\nloves an afflicted child. He would have liked to thrust that man aside,\r\nand gather up her and her children, and hold them and keep them as long\r\nas life lasted.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment or two Doudouce looked back at Mentine, standing at the\r\ngate with her baby. But her face was turned away from him. She was\r\ngazing after her husband, who went in the direction of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WIZARD FROM GETTYSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one afternoon in April, not long ago, only the other day, and\r\nthe shadows had already begun to lengthen.\r\n\r\nBertrand Delmand\xc3\xa9, a fine, bright-looking boy of fourteen\r\nyears,--fifteen, perhaps,--was mounted, and riding along a pleasant\r\ncountry road, upon a little Creole pony, such as boys in Louisiana\r\nusually ride when they have nothing better at hand. He had hunted, and\r\ncarried his gun before him.\r\n\r\nIt is unpleasant to state that Bertrand was not so depressed as he\r\nshould have been, in view of recent events that had come about. Within\r\nthe past week he had been recalled from the college of Grand Coteau to\r\nhis home, the Bon-Accueil plantation.\r\n\r\nHe had found his father and his grandmother depressed over money\r\nmatters, awaiting certain legal developments that might result in his\r\npermanent withdrawal from school. That very day, directly after the\r\nearly dinner, the two had driven to town, on this very business, to be\r\nabsent till the late afternoon. Bertrand, then, had saddled Picayune\r\nand gone for a long jaunt, such as his heart delighted in.\r\n\r\nHe was returning now, and had approached the beginning of the great\r\ntangled Cherokee hedge that marked the boundary line of Bon-Accueil,\r\nand that twinkled with multiple white roses.\r\n\r\nThe pony started suddenly and violently at something there in the turn\r\nof the road, and just under the hedge. It looked like a bundle of rags\r\nat first. But it was a tramp, seated upon a broad, flat stone.\r\n\r\nBertrand had no maudlin consideration for tramps as a species; he had\r\nonly that morning driven from the place one who was making himself\r\nunpleasant at the kitchen window.\r\n\r\nBut this tramp was old and feeble. His beard was long, and as white\r\nas new-ginned cotton, and when Bertrand saw him he was engaged in\r\nstanching a wound in his bare heel with a fistful of matted grass.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong, old man?" asked the boy, kindly.\r\n\r\nThe tramp looked up at him with a bewildered glance, but did not\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"Well," thought Bertrand, "since it\'s decided that I\'m to be a\r\nphysician some day, I can\'t begin to practice too early."\r\n\r\nHe dismounted, and examined the injured foot. It had an ugly gash.\r\nBertrand acted mostly from impulse. Fortunately his impulses were not\r\nbad ones. So, nimbly, and as quickly as he could manage it\', he had the\r\nold man astride Picayune, whilst he himself was leading the pony down\r\nthe narrow lane.\r\n\r\nThe dark green hedge towered like a high and solid wall on one side. On\r\nthe other was a broad, open field, where here and there appeared the\r\nflash and gleam of uplifted, polished hoes, that negroes were plying\r\nbetween the even rows of cotton and tender corn.\r\n\r\n"This is the State of Louisiana," uttered the tramp, quaveringly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, this is Louisiana," returned Bertrand cheerily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know it is. I\'ve been in all of them since Gettysburg.\r\nSometimes it was too hot, and sometimes it was too cold; and with\r\nthat bullet in my head--you don\'t remember? No, you don\'t remember\r\nGettysburg."\r\n\r\n"Well, no, not vividly," laughed Bertrand.\r\n\r\n"Is it a hospital? It isn\'t a factory, is it?" the man questioned.\r\n\r\n"Where we \'re going? Why, no, it\'s the Delmand\xc3\xa9\r\nplantation--Bon-Accueil. Here we are. Wait, I \'ll open the gate."\r\n\r\nThis singular group entered the yard from the rear, and not far from\r\nthe house. A big black woman, who sat just without a cabin door,\r\npicking a pile of rusty-looking moss, called out at sight of them:--\r\n\r\n"W\'at\'s dat you\'s bringin\' in dis yard, boy? top dat hoss?"\r\n\r\nShe received no reply. Bertrand, indeed, took no notice of her inquiry.\r\n\r\n"Fu\' a boy w\'at goes to school like you does--whar\'s yo\'sense?" she\r\nwent on, with a fine show of indignation; then, muttering to herself,\r\n"Ma\'ame Bertrand an\' Marse St. Ange ain\'t gwine stan\' dat, I knows dey\r\nain\'t. Dah! ef he ain\'t done sot \'im on de gall\'ry, plumb down in his\r\npa\'s rockin\'-cheer!"\r\n\r\nWhich the boy had done; seated the tramp in a pleasant corner of the\r\nveranda, while he went in search of bandages for his wound.\r\n\r\nThe servants showed high disapproval, the housemaid following Bertrand\r\ninto his grandmother\'s room, whither he had carried his investigations.\r\n\r\n"W\'at you tearin\' yo\' gra\'ma\'s closit to\' pieces dat away, boy?" she\r\ncomplained in her high soprano.\r\n\r\n"I\'m looking for bandages."\r\n\r\n"Den w\'y you don\'t ax fu\' ban\'ges, an\' lef yo\' gra\'ma\'s closit \'lone?\r\nYou want to listen to me; you gwine git shed o\' dat tramp settin\' dah\r\nnaxt to de dinin\'-room! W\'en de silva be missin\', \'tain\' you w\'at gwine\r\ngit blame, it\'s me."\r\n\r\n"The silver? Nonsense, \'Cindy; the man\'s wounded, and can\'t you see\r\nhe\'s out of his head?"\r\n\r\n"No mo\' outen his head \'an I is. \'T ain\' me w\'at want to tres\' [trust]\r\n\'im wid de sto\'-room key, ef he is outen his head," she concluded with\r\na disdainful shrug.\r\n\r\nBut Bertrand\'s prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 proved so unapproachable in his long-worn rags,\r\nthat the boy concluded to leave him unmolested till his father\'s\r\nreturn, and then ask permission to turn the forlorn creature into the\r\nbath-house, and array him afterward in clean, fresh garments.\r\n\r\nSo there the old tramp sat in the veranda corner, stolidly content,\r\nwhen St. Ange Delmand\xc3\xa9 and his mother returned from town.\r\n\r\nSt. Ange was a dark, slender man of middle age, with a sensitive face,\r\nand a plentiful sprinkle of gray in his thick black hair; his mother, a\r\nportly woman, and an active one for her sixty-five years.\r\n\r\nThey were evidently in a despondent mood. Perhaps it was for the cheer\r\nof her sweet presence that they had brought with them from town a\r\nlittle girl, the child of Madame Delmand\xc3\xa9\'s only daughter, who was\r\nmarried, and lived there.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmand\xc3\xa9 and her son were astonished to find so uninviting an\r\nintruder in possession. But a few earnest words from Bertrand reassured\r\nthem, and partly reconciled them to the man\'s presence; and it was with\r\nwholly indifferent though not unkindly glances that they passed him by\r\nwhen they entered. On any large plantation there are always nooks and\r\ncorners where, for a night or more, even such a man as this tramp may\r\nbe tolerated and given shelter.\r\n\r\nWhen Bertrand went to bed that night, he lay long awake thinking of the\r\nman, and of what he had heard from his lips in the hushed starlight.\r\nThe boy had heard of the awfulness of Gettysburg, till it was like\r\nsomething he could feel and quiver at.\r\n\r\nOn that field of battle this man had received a new and tragic birth.\r\nFor all his existence that went before was a blank to him. There, in\r\nthe black desolation of war, he was born again, without friends or\r\nkindred; without even a name he could know was his own. Then he had\r\ngone forth a wanderer; living more than half the time in hospitals;\r\ntoiling when he could, starving when he had to.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, he had addressed Bertrand as "St. Ange," not once,\r\nbut every time he had spoken to him. The boy wondered at this. Was it\r\nbecause he had heard Madame Delmand\xc3\xa9 address her son by that name, and\r\nfancied it?\r\n\r\nSo this nameless wanderer had drifted far down to the plantation of\r\nBon-Accueil, and at last had found a human hand stretched out to him in\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nWhen the family assembled at breakfast on the following morning,\r\nthe tramp was already settled in the chair, and in the corner which\r\nBertrand\'s indulgence had made familiar to him.\r\n\r\nIf he had turned partly around, he would have faced the flower garden,\r\nwith its graveled walks and trim parterres, where a tangle of color\r\nand perfume were holding high revelry this April morning; but he liked\r\nbetter to gaze into the back yard, where there was always movement: men\r\nand women coming and going, bearing implements of work; little negroes\r\nin scanty garments, darting here and there, and kicking up the dust in\r\ntheir exuberance.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmand\xc3\xa9 could just catch a glimpse of him through the long\r\nwindow that opened to the floor, and near which he sat.\r\n\r\nMr. Delmand\xc3\xa9 had spoken to the man pleasantly; but he and his mother\r\nwere wholly absorbed by their trouble, and talked constantly of that,\r\nwhile Bertrand went back and forth ministering to the old man\'s\r\nwants. The boy knew that the servants would have done the office with\r\nill grace, and he chose to be cup-bearer himself to the unfortunate\r\ncreature for whose presence he alone was responsible.\r\n\r\nOnce, when Bertrand went out to him with a second cup of coffee,\r\nsteaming and fragrant, the old man whispered:--\r\n\r\n"What are they saying in there?" pointing over his shoulder to the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, money troubles that will force us to economize for a while,"\r\nanswered the boy. "What father and _m\xc3\xa9-m\xc3\xa8re_ feel worst about is that I\r\nshall have to leave college now."\r\n\r\n"No, no! St. Ange must go to school. The war\'s over, the war\'s over!\r\nSt. Ange and Florentine must go to school."\r\n\r\n"But if there\'s no money," the boy insisted, smiling like one who\r\nhumors the vagaries of a child.\r\n\r\n"Money! money!" murmured the tramp. "The war\'s over--money! money!"\r\n\r\nHis sleepy gaze had swept across the yard into the thick of the orchard\r\nbeyond, and rested there.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he pushed aside the light table that had been set before him,\r\nand rose, clutching Bertrand\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"St. Ange, you must go to school!" he whispered. "The war\'s over,"\r\nlooking furtively around. "Come. Don\'t let them hear you. Don\'t let the\r\nnegroes see us. Get a spade--the little spade that Buck Williams was\r\ndigging his cistern with."\r\n\r\nStill clutching the boy, he dragged him down the steps as he said this,\r\nand traversed the yard with long, limping strides, himself leading the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nFrom under a shed where such things were to be found, Bertrand selected\r\na spade, since the tramp\'s whim demanded that he should, and together\r\nthey entered the orchard.\r\n\r\nThe grass was thick and tufted here, and wet with the morning dew.\r\nIn long lines, forming pleasant avenues between, were peach-trees\r\ngrowing, and pear and apple and plum. Close against the fence was the\r\npome-granate hedge, with its waxen blossoms, brick-red. Far down in the\r\ncentre of the orchard stood a huge pecan-tree, twice the size of any\r\nother that was there, seeming to rule like an old-time king.\r\n\r\nHere Bertrand and his guide stopped. The tramp had not once hesitated\r\nin his movements since grasping the arm of his young companion on the\r\nveranda. Now he went and leaned his back against the pecan-tree, where\r\nthere was a deep knot, and looking steadily before him he took ten\r\npaces forward. Turning sharply to the right, he made five additional\r\npaces. Then pointing his finger downward, and looking at Bertrand, he\r\ncommanded:--\r\n\r\n"There, dig. I would do it myself, but for my wounded foot. For I\'ve\r\nturned many a spade of earth since Gettysburg. Dig, St. Ange, dig! The\r\nwar\'s over; you must go to school."\r\n\r\nIs there a boy of fifteen under the sun who would not have dug, even\r\nknowing he was following the insane dictates of a demented man?\r\nBertrand entered with all the zest of his years and his spirit into the\r\ncurious adventure; and he dug and dug, throwing great spadefuls of the\r\nrich, fragrant earth from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe tramp, with body bent, and fingers like claws clasping his bony\r\nknees, stood watching with eager eyes, that never unfastened their\r\nsteady gaze from the boy\'s rhythmic motions.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" he muttered at intervals. "Dig, dig! The war\'s over. You\r\nmust go to school, St. Ange."\r\n\r\nDeep down in the earth, too deep for any ordinary turning of the soil\r\nwith spade or plow to have reached it, was a box. It was of tin,\r\napparently, something larger than a cigar box, and bound round and\r\nround with twine, rotted now and eaten away in places.\r\n\r\nThe tramp showed no surprise at seeing it there; he simply knelt upon\r\nthe ground and lifted it from its long resting place.\r\n\r\nBertrand had let the spade fall from his hands, and was quivering with\r\nthe awe of the thing he saw. Who could this wizard be that had come\r\nto him in the guise of a tramp, that walked in cabalistic paces upon\r\nhis own father\'s ground, and pointed his finger like a divining-rod to\r\nthe spot where boxes--may be treasures--lay? It was like a page from a\r\nwonder-book.\r\n\r\nAnd walking behind this white-haired old man, who was again leading\r\nthe way, something of childish superstition crept back into Bertrand\'s\r\nheart. It was the same feeling with which he had often sat, long ago,\r\nin the weird firelight of some negro\'s cabin, listening to tales of\r\nwitches who came in the night to work uncanny spells at their will.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmand\xc3\xa9 had never abandoned the custom of washing her own\r\nsilver and dainty china. She sat, when the breakfast was over, with a\r\npail of warm suds before her that \'Cindy had brought to her, with an\r\nabundance of soft linen cloths. Her little granddaughter stood beside\r\nher playing, as babies will, with the bright spoons and forks, and\r\nranging them in rows on the polished mahogany. St. Ange was at the\r\nwindow making entries in a note-book, and frowning gloomily as he did\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThe group in the dining-room were so em-ployed when the old tramp came\r\nstaggering in, Bertrand close behind him.\r\n\r\nHe went and stood at the foot of the table, opposite to where Madame\r\nDelmand\xc3\xa9 sat, and let fall the box upon it.\r\n\r\nThe thing in falling shattered, and from its bursting sides gold came,\r\nclicking, spinning, gliding, some of it like oil; rolling along the\r\ntable and off it to the floor, but heaped up, the bulk of it, before\r\nthe tramp.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s money!" he called out, plunging his old hand in the thick of\r\nit. "Who says St. Ange shall not go to school? The war\'s over--here\'s\r\nmoney! St. Ange, my boy," turning to Bertrand and speaking with quick\r\nauthority, "tell Buck Williams to hitch Black Bess to the buggy, and go\r\nbring Judge Parkerson here."\r\n\r\nJudge Parkerson, indeed, who had been dead for twenty years and more!\r\n\r\n"Tell him that--that"--and the hand that was not in the gold went up to\r\nthe withered forehead, "that--Bertrand Delmand\xc3\xa9 needs him!"\r\n\r\nMadame Delmand\xc3\xa9, at sight of the man with his box and his gold, had\r\ngiven a sharp cry, such as might follow the plunge of a knife. She lay\r\nnow in her son\'s arms, panting hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"Your father, St. Ange,--come back from the dead--your father!"\r\n\r\n"Be calm, mother!" the man implored. "You had such sure proof of his\r\ndeath in that terrible battle, this _may_ not be he."\r\n\r\n"I know him! I know your father, my son!" and disengaging herself from\r\nthe arms that held her, she dragged herself as a wounded serpent might\r\nto where the old man stood.\r\n\r\nHis hand was still in the gold, and on his face was yet the flush which\r\nhad come there when he shouted out the name Bertrand Delmand\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n"Husband," she gasped, "do you know me--your wife?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl was playing gleefully with the yellow coin.\r\n\r\nBertrand stood, pulseless almost, like a young Act\xc3\xa6on cut in marble.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man had looked long into the woman\'s imploring face, he\r\nmade a courtly-bow.\r\n\r\n"Madame," he said, "an old soldier, wounded on the field of Gettysburg,\r\ncraves for himself and his two little children your kind hospitality."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMA\'AME P\xc3\x89LAGIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the war began, there stood on C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse an imposing mansion\r\nof red brick, shaped like the Pantheon. A grove of majestic live-oaks\r\nsurrounded it.\r\n\r\nThirty years later, only the thick walls were standing, with the dull\r\nred brick showing here and there through a matted growth of clinging\r\nvines. The huge round pillars were intact; so to some extent was the\r\nstone flagging of hall and portico. There had been no home so stately\r\nalong the whole stretch of C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse. Every one knew that, as they\r\nknew it had cost Philippe Valmet sixty thousand dollars to build, away\r\nback in 1840. No one was in danger of forgetting that fact, so long as\r\nhis daughter P\xc3\xa9lagie survived. She was a queenly, white-haired woman\r\nof fifty. "Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie," they called her, though she was unmarried,\r\nas was her sister Pauline, a child in Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\'s eyes; a child\r\nof thirty-five. The two lived alone in a three-roomed cabin, almost\r\nwithin the shadow of the ruin. They lived for a dream, for Ma\'ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie\'s dream, which was to rebuild the old home.\r\n\r\nIt would be pitiful to tell how their days were spent to accomplish\r\nthis end; how the dollars had been saved for thirty years and the\r\npicayunes hoarded; and yet, not half enough gathered! But Ma\'ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie felt sure of twenty years of life before her, and counted\r\nupon as many more for her sister. And what could not come to pass in\r\ntwenty--in forty--years?\r\n\r\nOften, of pleasant afternoons, the two would drink their black coffee,\r\nseated upon the stone-flagged portico whose canopy was the blue sky of\r\nLouisiana. They loved to sit there in the silence, with only each other\r\nand the sheeny, prying lizards for company, talking of the old times\r\nand planning for the new; while light breezes stirred the tattered\r\nvines high up among the columns, where owls nested.\r\n\r\n"We can never hope to have all just as it was, Pauline," Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\r\nwould say; "perhaps the marble pillars of the salon will have to be\r\nreplaced by wooden ones, and the crystal candelabra left out. Should\r\nyou be willing, Pauline?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Ses\xc5\x93ur, I shall be willing." It was always, "Yes, Ses\xc5\x93ur,"\r\nor "No, Ses\xc5\x93ur," "Just as you please, Ses\xc5\x93ur," with poor little\r\nMam\'selle Pauline. For what did she remember of that old life and that\r\nold splendor? Only a faint gleam here and there; the half-consciousness\r\nof a young, uneventful existence; and then a great crash. That meant\r\nthe nearness of war; the revolt of slaves; confusion ending in fire and\r\nflame through which she was borne safely in the strong arms of P\xc3\xa9lagie,\r\nand carried to the log cabin which was still their home. Their brother,\r\nL\xc3\xa9andre, had known more of it all than Pauline, and not so much as\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie. He had left the management of the big plantation with all its\r\nmemories and traditions to his older sister, and had gone away to dwell\r\nin cities. That was many years ago. Now, L\xc3\xa9andre\'s business called\r\nhim frequently and upon long journeys from home, and his motherless\r\ndaughter was coming to stay with her aunts at C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse.\r\n\r\nThey talked about it, sipping their coffee on the ruined portico.\r\nMam\'selle Pauline was terribly excited; the flush that throbbed into\r\nher pale, nervous face showed it; and she locked her thin fingers in\r\nand out incessantly.\r\n\r\n"But what shall we do with La Petite, Ses\xc5\x93ur? Where shall we put her?\r\nHow shall we amuse her? Ah, Seigneur!"\r\n\r\n"She will sleep upon a cot in the room next to ours," responded Ma\'ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie, "and live as we do. She knows how we live, and why we live;\r\nher father has told her. She knows we have money and could squander\r\nit if we chose. Do not fret, Pauline; let us hope La Petite is a true\r\nValmet."\r\n\r\nThen Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie rose with stately deliberation and went to saddle?\r\nher horse, for she had yet to make her last daily round through the\r\nfields; and Mam\'selle Pauline threaded her way slowly among the tangled\r\ngrasses toward the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe coming of La Petite, bringing with her as she did the pungent\r\natmosphere of an outside and dimly known world, was a shock to these\r\ntwo, lining their dream-life. The girl was quite as tall as her aunt\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie, with dark eyes that reflected joy as a still pool reflects\r\nthe light of stars; and her rounded cheek was tinged like the pink\r\ncr\xc3\xa8pe myrtle. Mam\'selle Pauline kissed her and trembled. Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\r\nlooked into her eyes with a searching gaze, which seemed to seek a\r\nlikeness of the past in the living present.\r\n\r\nAnd they made room between them for this young life.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Petite had determined upon trying to fit herself to the strange,\r\nnarrow existence which she knew awaited her at C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse. It went\r\nwell enough at first. Sometimes she followed Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie into the\r\nfields to note how the cotton was opening, ripe and white; or to count\r\nthe ears of corn upon the hardy stalks. But oftener she was with her\r\naunt Pauline, assisting in household offices, chattering of her brief\r\npast, or walking with the older woman arm-in-arm under the trailing\r\nmoss of the giant oaks.\r\n\r\nMam\'selle Pauline\'s steps grew very buoy-ant that summer, and her\r\neyes were sometimes as bright as a bird\'s, unless La Petite were away\r\nfrom her side, when they would lose all other light but one of uneasy\r\nexpectancy. The girl seemed to love her well in return, and called her\r\nendearingly Tan\'-tante. But as the time went by, La Petite became very\r\nquiet,--not listless, but thoughtful, and slow in her movements. Then\r\nher cheeks began to pale, till they were tinged like the creamy plumes\r\nof the white cr\xc3\xa8pe myrtle that grew in the ruin.\r\n\r\nOne day when she sat within its shadow, between her aunts, holding a\r\nhand of each, she said: "Tante P\xc3\xa9lagie, I must tell you something, you\r\nand Tan\'tante." She spoke low, but clearly and firmly. "I love you\r\nboth,--please remember that I love you both. But I must go away from\r\nyou. I can\'t live any longer here at C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse."\r\n\r\nA spasm passed through Mam\'selle Pauline\'s delicate frame. La Petite\r\ncould feel the twitch of it in the wiry fingers that were intertwined\r\nwith her own. Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie remained unchanged and motionless. No\r\nhuman eye could penetrate so deep as to see the satisfaction which her\r\nsoul felt. She said: "What do you mean, Petite? Your father has sent\r\nyou to us, and I am sure it is his wish that you remain."\r\n\r\n"My father loves me, tante P\xc3\xa9lagie, and such will not be his wish when\r\nhe knows. Oh!" she continued with a restless movement, "it is as\r\nthough a weight were pressing me backward here. I must live another\r\nlife; the life I lived before. I want to know things that are happening\r\nfrom day to day over the world, and hear them talked about. I want my\r\nmusic, my books, my companions. If I had known no other life but this\r\none of privation, I suppose it would be different. If I had to live\r\nthis life, I should make the best of it. But I do not have to; and you\r\nknow, tante P\xc3\xa9lagie, you do not need to. It seems to me," she added in\r\na whisper, "that it is a sin against myself. Ah, Tan\'tante!--what is\r\nthe matter with Tan\'tante?"\r\n\r\nIt was nothing; only a slight feeling of faintness, that would soon\r\npass. She entreated them to take no notice; but they brought her some\r\nwater and fanned her with a palmetto leaf.\r\n\r\nBut that night, in the stillness of the room, Mam\'selle Pauline sobbed\r\nand would not be comforted. Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie took her in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Pauline, my little sister Pauline," she entreated, "I never have seen\r\nyou like this before. Do you no longer love me? Have we not been happy\r\ntogether, you and I?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Ses\xc5\x93ur."\r\n\r\n"Is it because La Petite is going away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Ses\xc5\x93ur."\r\n\r\n"Then she is dearer to you than I!" spoke Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie with sharp\r\nresentment. "Than I, who held you and warmed you in my arms the day you\r\nwere born; than I, your mother, father, sister, everything that could\r\ncherish you. Pauline, don\'t tell me that."\r\n\r\nMam\'selle Pauline tried to talk through her sobs.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain it to you, Ses\xc5\x93ur. I don\'t understand it myself. I\r\nlove you as I have always loved you; next to God. But if La Petite goes\r\naway I shall die. I can\'t understand,--help me, Ses\xc5\x93ur. She seems\r\n--she seems like a saviour; like one who had come and taken me by the\r\nhand and was leading me somewhere--somewhere I want to go."\r\n\r\nMa\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had been sitting beside the bed in her peignoir and\r\nslippers. She held the hand of her sister who lay there, and smoothed\r\ndown the woman\'s soft brown hair. She said not a! word, and the silence\r\nwas broken only by Ma\'mselle Pauline\'s continued sobs. Once Ma\'ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie arose to drink of orange-flower water, which she gave to her\r\nsister, as she would have offered it to a nervous, fretful child.\r\nAlmost an hour passed before Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie spoke again. Then she\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"Pauline, you must cease that sobbing, now, and sleep. You will make\r\nyourself ill. La Petite will not go away. Do you hear me? Do you\r\nunderstand? She will stay, I promise you."\r\n\r\nMam\'selle Pauline could not clearly comprehend, but she had great faith\r\nin the word of her sister, and soothed by the promise and the touch of\r\nMa\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\'s strong, gentle hand, she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMa\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie, when she saw that her sister slept, arose noiselessly\r\nand stepped outside upon the low-roofed narrow gallery. She did not\r\nlinger there, but with a step that was hurried and agitated, she\r\ncrossed the distance that divided her cabin from the ruin.\r\n\r\nThe night was not a dark one, for the sky was clear and the moon\r\nresplendent. But light or dark would have made no difference to Ma\'ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie. It was not the first time she had stolen away to the ruin at\r\nnight-time, when the whole plantation slept; but she never before had\r\nbeen there with a heart so nearly broken. She was going there for the\r\nlast time to dream her dreams; to see the visions that hitherto had\r\ncrowded her days and nights, and to bid them farewell.\r\n\r\nThere was the first of them, awaiting her upon the very portal; a\r\nrobust old white-haired man, chiding her for returning home so late.\r\nThere are guests to be entertained. Does she not know it? Guests from\r\nthe city and from the near plantations. Yes, she knows it is late. She\r\nhad been abroad with F\xc3\xa9lix, and they did not notice how the time was\r\nspeeding. F\xc3\xa9lix is there; he will explain it all. He is there beside\r\nher, but she does not want to hear what he will tell her father.\r\n\r\nMa\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had sunk upon the bench where she and her sister so\r\noften came to sit. Turning, she gazed in through the gaping chasm of\r\nthe window at her side. The interior of the ruin is ablaze. Not with\r\nthe moonlight, for that is faint beside the other one--the sparkle\r\nfrom the crystal candelabra, which negroes, moving noiselessly and\r\nrespectfully about, are lighting, one after the other. How the gleam\r\nof them reflects and glances from the polished marble pillars!\r\n\r\nThe room holds a number of guests. There is old Monsieur Lucien\r\nSantien, leaning against one of the pillars, and laughing at something\r\nwhich Monsieur Lafirme is telling him, till his fat shoulders shake.\r\nHis son Jules is with him--Jules, who wants to marry her. She laughs.\r\nShe wonders if F\xc3\xa9lix has told her father yet. There is young Jerome\r\nLafirme playing at checkers upon the sofa with L\xc3\xa9andre. Little Pauline\r\nstands annoying them and disturbing the game. L\xc3\xa9andre reproves her. She\r\nbegins to cry, and old black Cl\xc3\xa9mentine, her nurse, who is not far off,\r\nlimps across the room to pick her up and carry her away. How sensitive\r\nthe little one is! But she trots about and takes care of herself better\r\nthan she did a year or two ago, when she fell upon the stone hall floor\r\nand raised a great "bo-bo" on her forehead. P\xc3\xa9lagie was hurt and angry\r\nenough about it; and she ordered rugs and buffalo robes to be brought\r\nand laid thick upon the tiles, till the little one\'s steps were surer.\r\n\r\n"Il ne faut pas faire mal \xc3\xa0 Pauline."\r\n\r\nShe was saying it aloud--"faire mal \xc3\xa0 Pauline."\r\n\r\nBut she gazes beyond the salon, back into the big dining hall, where\r\nthe white cr\xc3\xa8pe myrtle grows. Ha! how low that bat has circled. It\r\nhas struck Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie full on the breast. She does not know it.\r\nShe is beyond there in the dining hall, where her father sits with a\r\ngroup of friends over their wine. As usual they are talking politics.\r\nHow tiresome! She has heard them say "la guerre" oftener than once. La\r\nguerre. Bah! She and F\xc3\xa9lix have something pleasanter to talk about, out\r\nunder the oaks, or back in the shadow of the oleanders.\r\n\r\nBut they were right! The sound of a cannon, shot at Sumter, has rolled\r\nacross the\' Southern States, and its echo is heard along the whole\r\nstretch of C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse.\r\n\r\nYet P\xc3\xa9lagie does not believe it. Not till La Ricaneuse stands before\r\nher with bare, black arms akimbo, uttering a volley of vile abuse and\r\nof brazen impudence. P\xc3\xa9lagie wants to kill her. But yet she will not\r\nbelieve. Not till F\xc3\xa9lix comes to her in the chamber above the dining\r\nhall--there where that trumpet vine hangs--comes to say good-by to\r\nher. The hurt which the big brass buttons of his new gray uniform\r\npressed into the tender flesh of her bosom has never left it. She sits\r\nupon the sofa, and he beside her, both speechless with pain. That room\r\nwould not have been altered. Even the sofa would have been there in the\r\nsame spot, and Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had meant all along, for thirty years,\r\nall along, to lie there upon it some day when the time came to die.\r\n\r\nBut there is no time to weep, with the enemy at the door. The door has\r\nbeen no barrier. They are clattering through the halls now, drinking\r\nthe wines, shattering the crystal and glass, slashing the portraits.\r\n\r\nOne of them stands before her and tells her to leave the house. She\r\nslaps his face. How the stigma stands out red as blood upon his\r\nblanched cheek!\r\n\r\nNow there is a roar of fire and the flames are bearing down upon her\r\nmotionless figure. She wants to show them how a daughter of Louisiana\r\ncan perish before her conquerors. But little Pauline clings to her\r\nknees in an agony of terror. Little Pauline must be saved.\r\n\r\n"Il ne faut pas faire mal \xc3\xa0 Pauline."\r\n\r\nAgain she is saying it aloud--"faire mal \xc3\xa0 Pauline."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe night was nearly spent; Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had glided from the bench\r\nupon which she had rested, and for hours lay prone upon the stone\r\nflagging, motionless. When she dragged herself to her feet it was to\r\nwalk like one in a dream. About the great, solemn pillars, one after\r\nthe other, she reached her arms, and pressed her cheek and her lips\r\nupon the senseless brick.\r\n\r\n"Adieu, adieu!" whispered Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer the moon to guide her steps across the familiar\r\npathway to the cabin. The brightest light in the sky was Venus, that\r\nswung low in the east. The bats had ceased to beat their wings about\r\nthe ruin. Even the mocking-bird that had warbled for hours in the old\r\nmulberry-tree had sung himself asleep. That darkest hour before the\r\nday was mantling the earth. Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie hurried through the wet,\r\nclinging grass, beating aside the heavy moss that swept across her\r\nface, walking on toward the cabin--toward Pauline. Not once did she\r\nlook back upon the ruin that brooded like a huge monster--a black spot\r\nin the darkness that enveloped it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle more than a year later the transformation which the old Valmet\r\nplace had undergone was the talk and wonder of C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse. One would\r\nhave looked in vain for the ruin; it was no longer there; neither was\r\nthe log cabin. But out in the open, where the sun shone upon it, and\r\nthe breezes blew about it, was a shapely structure fashioned from woods\r\nthat the forests of the State had furnished. It rested upon a solid\r\nfoundation of brick.\r\n\r\nUpon a corner of the pleasant gallery sat L\xc3\xa9andre smoking his afternoon\r\ncigar, and chatting with neighbors who had called. This was to be\r\nhis _pied \xc3\xa0 terre_ now; the home where his sisters and his daughter\r\ndwelt. The laughter of young people was heard out under the trees, and\r\nwithin the house where La Petite was playing upon the piano. With the\r\nenthusiasm of a young artist she drew from the keys strains that seemed\r\nmarvelously beautiful to Mam\'selle Pauline, who stood enraptured near\r\nher. Mam\'selle Pauline had been touched by the re-creation of Valmet.\r\nHer cheek was as full and almost as flushed as La Petite\'s. The years\r\nwere falling away from her.\r\n\r\nMa\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had been conversing with her brother and his friends.\r\nThen she turned and walked away; stopping to listen awhile to the music\r\nwhich La Petite was making. But it was only for a moment. She went\r\non around the curve of the veranda, where she found herself alone.\r\nShe stayed there, erect, holding to the banister rail and looking out\r\ncalmly in the distance across the fields.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in black, with the white kerchief she always wore\r\nfolded across her bosom. Her thick, glossy hair rose like a silver\r\ndiadem from her brow. In her deep, dark eyes smouldered the light of\r\nfires that would never flame. She had grown very old. Years instead of\r\nmonths seemed to have passed over her since the night she bade farewell\r\nto her visions.\r\n\r\nPoor Ma\'ame P\xc3\xa9lagie! How could it be different! While the outward\r\npressure of a young and joyous existence had forced her footsteps into\r\nthe light, her soul had stayed in the shadow of the ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE \'CADIAN BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBobin\xc3\xb4t, that big, brown, good-natured Bobin\xc3\xb4t, had no intention of\r\ngoing to the ball, even though he knew Calixta would be there. For what\r\ncame of those balls but heartache, and a sickening disinclination for\r\nwork the whole week through, till Saturday night came again and his\r\ntortures began afresh? Why could he not love Oz\xc3\xa9ina, who would marry\r\nhim to-morrow; or Fronie, or any one of a dozen others, rather than\r\nthat little Spanish vixen? Calixta\'s slender foot had never touched\r\nCuban soil; but her mother\'s had, and the Spanish was in her blood all\r\nthe same. For that reason the prairie people forgave her much that they\r\nwould not have overlooked in their own daughters or sisters.\r\n\r\nHer eyes,--Bobin\xc3\xb4t thought of her eyes, and weakened,--the bluest, the\r\ndrowsiest, most tantalizing that ever looked into a man\'s; he thought\r\nof her flaxen hair that kinked worse than a mulatto\'s close to her\r\nhead; that broad, smiling mouth and tip-tilted nose, that full figure;\r\nthat voice like a rich contralto song, with cadences in it that must\r\nhave been taught by Satan, for there was no one else to teach her\r\ntricks on that \'Cadian prairie. Bobin\xc3\xb4t thought of them all as he\r\nplowed his rows of cane.\r\n\r\nThere had even been a breath of scandal whispered about her a year\r\nago, when she went to Assumption,--but why talk of it? No one did now.\r\n"C\'est Espagnol, \xc3\xa7a," most of them said with lenient shoulder-shrugs.\r\n"Bon chien tient de race," the old men mumbled over their pipes,\r\nstirred by recollections. Nothing was made of it, except that Fronie\r\nthrew it up to Calixta when the two quarreled and fought on the church\r\nsteps after mass one Sunday, about a lover. Calixta swore roundly in\r\nfine \'Cadian French and with true Spanish spirit, and slapped Fronie\'s\r\nface. Fronie had slapped her back; "Tiens, bocotte, va!" "Esp\xc3\xa8ce de\r\nlion\xc3\xa8se; prends \xc3\xa7a, et \xc3\xa7a!" till the cur\xc3\xa9 himself was obliged to hasten\r\nand make peace between them. Bobin\xc3\xb4t thought of it all, and would not\r\ngo to the ball.\r\n\r\nBut in the afternoon, over at Friedheimer\'s store, where he was buying\r\na trace-chain, he heard some one say that Alc\xc3\xa9e Laballi\xc3\xa8re would be\r\nthere. Then wild horses could not have kept him away. He knew how it\r\nwould be--or rather he did not know how it would be--if the handsome\r\nyoung planter came over to the ball as he sometimes did. If Alc\xc3\xa9e\r\nhappened to be in a serious mood, he might only go to the card-room and\r\nplay a round or two; or he might stand out on the galleries talking\r\ncrops and politics with the old people. But there was po telling. A\r\ndrink or two could put the devil in his head,--that was what Bobin\xc3\xb4t\r\nsaid to himself, as he wiped the sweat from his brow with his red\r\nbandanna; a gleam from Calixta\'s eyes, a flash of her ankle, a twirl of\r\nher skirts could do the same. Yes, Bobin\xc3\xb4t would go to the ball.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was the year Alc\xc3\xa9e Laballi\xc3\xa8re put nine hundred acres in rice.\r\nIt was putting a good deal of money into the ground, but the returns\r\npromised to be glorious. Old Madame Laballi\xc3\xa8re, sailing about the\r\nspacious galleries in her white _volante_, figured it all out in her\r\nhead. Clarisse, her god-daughter, helped her a little, and together\r\nthey built more air-castles than enough. Alc\xc3\xa9e worked like a mule that\r\ntime; and if he did not kill himself, it was because his constitution\r\nwas an iron one. It was an every-day affair for him to come in from\r\nthe field well-nigh exhausted, and wet to the waist. He did not mind\r\nif there were visitors; he left them to his mother and Clarisse. There\r\nwere often guests: young men and women who came up from the city, which\r\nwas but a few hours away, to visit his beautiful kinswoman. She was\r\nworth going a good deal farther than that to see. Dainty as a lily;\r\nhardy as a sunflower; slim, tall, graceful, like one of the reeds that\r\ngrew in the marsh. Cold and kind and cruel by turn, and everything that\r\nwas aggravating to Alc\xc3\xa9e.\r\n\r\nHe would have liked to sweep the place of those visitors, often. Of\r\nthe men, above all, with their ways and their manners; their swaying\r\nof fans like women, and dandling about hammocks. He could have pitched\r\nthem over the levee into the river, if it hadn\'t meant murder. That\r\nwas Alc\xc3\xa9e. But he must have been crazy the day he came in from the\r\nrice-field, and, toil-stained as he was, clasped Clarisse by the arms\r\nand panted a volley of hot, blistering love-words into her face. No man\r\nhad ever spoken love to her like that.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur!" she exclaimed, looking him full in the eyes, without a\r\nquiver. Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s hands dropped and his glance wavered before the chill\r\nof her calm, clear eyes.\r\n\r\n"_Par exemple!_" she muttered disdainfully, as she turned from him,\r\ndeftly adjusting the careful toilet that he had so brutally disarranged.\r\n\r\nThat happened a day or two before the cyclone came that cut into the\r\nrice like fine steel. It was an awful thing, coming so swiftly, without\r\na moment\'s warning in which to light a holy candle or set a piece of\r\nblessed palm burning. Old madame wept openly and said her beads, just\r\nas her son Didier, the New Orleans one, would have done. If such a\r\nthing had happened to Alphonse, the Laballi\xc3\xa8re planting cotton up in\r\nNatchitoches, he would have raved and stormed like a second cyclone,\r\nand made his surroundings unbearable for a day or two. But Alc\xc3\xa9e took\r\nthe misfortune differently. He looked ill and gray after it, and said\r\nnothing. His speechlessness was frightful. Clarisse\'s heart melted\r\nwith tenderness; but when she offered her soft, purring words of\r\ncondolence, he accepted them with mute indifference. Then she and her\r\nn\xc3\xa9naine wept afresh in each other\'s arms.\r\n\r\nA night or two later, when Clarisse went to her window to kneel\r\nthere in the moonlight and say her prayers before retiring, she saw\r\nthat Bruce, Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s negro servant, had led his master\'s saddle-horse\r\nnoiselessly along the edge of the sward that bordered the gravel-path,\r\nand stood holding him near by. Presently, she heard Alc\xc3\xa9e quit his\r\nroom, which was beneath her own, and traverse the lower portico. As\r\nhe emerged from the shadow and crossed the strip of moonlight, she\r\nperceived that he carried a pair of well-filled saddle-bags which he at\r\nonce flung across the animal\'s back. He then lost no time in mounting,\r\nand after a brief exchange of words with Bruce, went cantering away,\r\ntaking no precaution to avoid the noisy gravel as the negro had done.\r\n\r\nClarisse had never Suspected that it might be Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s custom to sally\r\nforth from the plantation secretly, and at such an hour; for it was\r\nnearly midnight. And had it not been for the telltale saddle-bags, she\r\nwould only have crept to bed, to wonder, to fret and dream unpleasant\r\ndreams. But her impatience and anxiety would not be held in check.\r\nHastily unbolting the shutters of her door that opened upon the\r\ngallery, she stepped outside and called softly to the old negro.\r\n\r\n"Gre\'t Peter! Miss Clarisse. I was n\' sho it was a ghos\' o\' w\'at,\r\nstan\'in\' up dah, plumb in de night, data way."\r\n\r\nHe mounted halfway up the long, broad flight of stairs. She was\r\nstanding at the top.\r\n\r\n"Bruce, w\'ere has Monsieur Alc\xc3\xa9e gone?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"W\'y, he gone \'bout he business, I reckin," replied Bruce, striving to\r\nbe non-committal at the outset.\r\n\r\n"W\'ere has Monsieur Alc\xc3\xa9e gone?" she reiterated, stamping her bare\r\nfoot. "I won\'t stan\' any nonsense or any lies; mine, Bruce."\r\n\r\n"I don\' ric\'lie ez I eva tole you lie _yit_, Miss Clarisse. Mista\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e, he all broke up, sho."\r\n\r\n"W\'ere--has--he gone? Ah, Sainte Vierge! faut de la patience! butor,\r\nva!"\r\n\r\n"W\'en I was in he room, a-breshin\' off he clo\'es to-day," the darkey\r\nbegan, settling himself against the stair-rail, "he look dat speechless\r\nan\' down, I say, \'You \'pear tu me like some pussun w\'at gwine have a\r\nspell o\' sickness, Mista Alc\xc3\xa9e.\' He say, \'You reckin?\' \'I dat he git\r\nup, go look hisse\'f stiddy in de glass. Den he go to de chimbly an\'\r\njerk up de quinine bottle an po\' a gre\'t hoss-dose on to be ban\'. An\'\r\nhe swalla dat mess in a wink, an\' wash hit down wid a big dram o\'\r\nw\'iskey w\'at he keep in he room, aginst he come all soppin\' wet outen\r\nde fiel\'.\r\n\r\n"He \'lows, \'No, I ain\' gwine be sick, Bruce.\' Den he square off. He\r\nsay, \'I kin mak out to stan\' up an\' gi\' an\' take wid any man I knows,\r\nlessen hit\'s John L. Sulvun. But w\'en God A\'mighty an\' a \'oman jines\r\nfo\'ces agin me, dat\'s one too many fur me.\' I tell \'im, \'Jis so,\'\r\nwhils\' I\'se makin\' out to bresh a spot off w\'at ain\' dah, on he coat\r\ncolla. I tell \'im, \'You wants li\'le res\', suh.\' He say, \'No, I wants\r\nli\'le fling; dat w\'at I wants; an I gwine git it. Pitch me a fis\'ful\r\no\' clo\'es in dem \'ar saddle-bags.\' Dat w\'at he say. Don\'t you bodda,\r\nmissy. He jis\' gone a-caperin\' yonda to de Cajun ball. Uh--uh--de\r\nskeeters is fair\' a-swarmin\' like bees roun\' yo\' foots!"\r\n\r\nThe mosquitoes were indeed attacking Clarisse\'s white feet savagely.\r\nShe had unconsciously been alternately rubbing one foot over the other\r\nduring the darkey\'s recital.\r\n\r\n"The \'Cadian ball," she repeated contemptously. "Humph! _Par exemple!_\r\nNice conduc\' for a Laballi\xc3\xa8re. An\' he needs a saddle-bag, fill\' with\r\nclothes, to go to the \'Cadian ball!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Clarisse; you go on to bed, chile; git yo\' soun\' sleep. He\r\n\'low he come back in couple weeks o\' so. I kiarn be repeatin\' lot o\'\r\ntruck w\'at young mans say, out heah face o\' a young gal."\r\n\r\nClarisse said no more, but turned and abruptly re\xc3\xabntered the house.\r\n\r\n"You done talk too much wid yo\' mouf a\'ready, you ole fool nigga, you,"\r\nmuttered Bruce to himself as he walked away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e reached the ball very late, of course--too late for the chicken\r\ngumbo which had been served at midnight.\r\n\r\nThe big, low-ceiled room--they called it a hall--was packed with\r\nmen and women dancing to the music of three fiddles. There were\r\nbroad galleries all around it. There was a room at one side where\r\nsober-faced men were playing cards. Another, in which babies were\r\nsleeping, was called _le parc aux petits_. Any one who is white may go\r\nto a \'Cadian ball, but he must pay for his lemonade, his coffee and\r\nchicken gumbo. And he must behave himself like a \'Cadian. Grosb\xc5\x93uf was\r\ngiving this ball. He had been giving them since he was a young man,\r\nand he was a middle-aged one, now. In that time he could recall but\r\none disturbance, and that was caused by American railroaders, who were\r\nnot in touch with their surroundings and had no business there. "Ces\r\nmaudits gens du raiderode," Grosb\xc5\x93uf called them.\r\n\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e Laballi\xc3\xa8re\'s presence at the ball caused a flutter even among\r\nthe men, who could not but admire his "nerve" after such misfortune\r\nbefalling him. To be sure, they knew the Laballi\xc3\xa8res were rich--that\r\nthere were resources East, and more again in the city. But they felt\r\nit took a brave homme to stand a blow like that philosophically. One\r\nold gentleman, who was in the habit of reading a Paris newspaper and\r\nknew things, chuckled gleefully to, everybody that Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s conduct was\r\naltogether chic, mais chic. That he had more _panache_ than Boulanger.\r\nWell, perhaps he had.\r\n\r\nBut what he did not show outwardly was that he was in a mood for ugly\r\nthings to-night. Poor Bobin\xc3\xb4t alone felt it vaguely. He discerned a\r\ngleam of it in Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s handsome eyes, as the young planter stood in the\r\ndoorway, looking with rather feverish glance upon the assembly, while\r\nhe laughed and talked with a \'Cadian farmer who was beside him.\r\n\r\nBobin\xc3\xb4t himself was dull-looking and clumsy. Most of the men were. But\r\nthe young women were very beautiful. The eyes that glanced into Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s\r\nas they passed him were big, dark, soft as those of the young heifers\r\nstanding out in the cool prairie grass.\r\n\r\nBut the belle was Calixta. Her white dress was not nearly so handsome\r\nor well made as Fronie\'s (she and Fronie had quite forgotten the battle\r\non the church steps, and were friends again), nor were her slippers so\r\nstylish as those of Oz\xc3\xa9ina; and she fanned herself with a handkerchief,\r\nsince she had broken her red fan at the last ball, and her aunts and\r\nuncles were not willing to give her another. But all the men agreed she\r\nwas at her best to-night. Such animation! and abandon! such flashes of\r\nwit!\r\n\r\n"He, Bobin\xc3\xb4t! _Mais_ w\'at\'s the matta? W\'at you standin\' _plant\xc3\xa9 l\xc3\xa0_\r\nlike ole Ma\'ame Tina\'s cow in the bog, you?"\r\n\r\nThat was good. That was an excellent thrust at Bobin\xc3\xb4t, who had\r\nforgotten the figure of the dance with his mind bent on other things,\r\nand it started a clamor of laughter at his expense. He joined\r\ngood-naturedly. It was better to receive even such notice as that from\r\nCalixta than none at all. But Madame Suzonne, sitting in a corner,\r\nwhispered to her neighbor that if Oz\xc3\xa9ina were to conduct herself in a\r\nlike manner, she should immediately be taken out to the mule-cart and\r\ndriven home. The women did not always approve of Calixta.\r\n\r\nNow and then were short lulls in the dance, when couples flocked out\r\nupon the galleries for a brief respite and fresh air. The moon had\r\ngone down pale in the west, and in the east was yet no promise of day.\r\nAfter such an interval, when the dancers again assembled to resume the\r\ninterrupted quadrille, Calixta was not among them.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting upon a bench out in the shadow, with Alc\xc3\xa9e beside her.\r\nThey were acting like fools. He had attempted to take a little gold\r\nring from her finger; just for the fun of it, for there was nothing he\r\ncould have done with the ring but replace it again. But she clinched\r\nher hand tight. He pretended that it was a very difficult matter to\r\nopen it. Then he kept the hand in his. They seemed to forget about it.\r\nHe played with her ear-ring, a thin crescent of gold hanging from her\r\nsmall brown ear. He caught a wisp of the kinky hair that had escaped\r\nits fastening, and rubbed the ends of it against his shaven cheek.\r\n\r\n"You know, last year in Assumption, Calixta?" They belonged to the\r\nyounger generation, so preferred to speak English.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t come say Assumption to me, M\'sieur Alc\xc3\xa9e. I done yeard\r\nAssumption till I\'m plumb sick."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. The idiots! Because you were in Assumption, and I\r\nhappened to go to Assumption, they must have it that we went together.\r\nBut it was nice--_hein_, Calixta?--in Assumption?"\r\n\r\nThey saw Bobin\xc3\xb4t emerge from the hall and stand a moment outside the\r\nlighted doorway, peering uneasily and searchingly into the darkness. He\r\ndid not see them, and went slowly back.\r\n\r\n"There is Bobin\xc3\xb4t looking for you. You are going to set poor Bobin\xc3\xb4t\r\ncrazy. You \'ll marry him some day; _hein_, Calixta?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say no, me," she replied, striving to withdraw her hand, which\r\nhe held more, firmly for the attempt.\r\n\r\n"But come, Calixta; you know you said you would go back to Assumption,\r\njust to spite them."\r\n\r\n"No, I neva said that, me. You mus\' dreamt that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought you did. You know I\'m going down to the city."\r\n\r\n"W\'en?"\r\n\r\n"To-night."\r\n\r\n"Betta make has\'e, then; it\'s mos\' day."\r\n\r\n"Well, to-morrow\'ll do."\r\n\r\n"W\'at you goin\' do, yonda?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Drown myself in the lake, maybe; unless you go down\r\nthere to visit your uncle."\r\n\r\nCalixta\'s senses were reeling; and they well-nigh left her when she\r\nfelt Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s lips brush her ear like the touch of a rose.\r\n\r\n"Mista Alc\xc3\xa9e! Is dat Mista Alc\xc3\xa9e?" the thick voice of a negro was\r\nasking; he stood on the ground, holding to the banister-rails near\r\nwhich the couple sat.\r\n\r\n"W\'at do you want now?" cried Alc\xc3\xa9e impatiently. "Can\'t I have a\r\nmoment of peace?"\r\n\r\n"I ben huntin\' you high an\' low, suh," answered the man. "Dey--dey some\r\none in de road, onda de mulbare-tree, want see you a minute."\r\n\r\n"I would n\'t go out to the road to see the Angel Gabriel. And if you\r\ncome back here with any more talk, I \'ll have to break your neck." The\r\nnegro turned mumbling away.\r\n\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e and Calixta laughed softly about it. Her boisterousness was all\r\ngone. They talked low, and laughed softly, as lovers do.\r\n\r\n"Alc\xc3\xa9e! Alc\xc3\xa9e Laballi\xc3\xa8re!"\r\n\r\nIt was not the negro\'s voice this time; but one that went through\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e\'s body like an electric shock, bringing him to his feet.\r\n\r\nClarisse was standing there in her riding-habit, where the negro had\r\nstood. For an instant confusion reigned in Alc\xc3\xa9e\'s thoughts, as with\r\none who awakes suddenly from a dream. But he felt that something of\r\nserious import had brought his cousin to the ball in the dead of night.\r\n\r\n"W\'at does this mean, Clarisse?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It means something has happen\' at home. You mus\' come."\r\n\r\n"Happened to maman?" he questioned, in alarm.\r\n\r\n"No; n\xc3\xa9naine is well, and asleep. It is something else. Not to frighten\r\nyou. But you mus\' come. Come with me, Alc\xc3\xa9e."\r\n\r\nThere was no need for the imploring note. He would have followed the\r\nvoice anywhere.\r\n\r\nShe had now recognized the girl sitting back on the bench.\r\n\r\n"Ah, c\'est vous, Calixta? Comment \xc3\xa7a va, mon enfant?"\r\n\r\n"Tcha va b\'en; et vous, mam\'z\xc3\xa9lle?"\r\n\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e swung himself over the low rail and started to follow Clarisse,\r\nwithout a word, without a glance back at the girl. He had forgotten he\r\nwas leaving her there. But Clarisse whispered something to him, and he\r\nturned back to say "Good-night, Calixta," and offer his hand to press\r\nthrough the railing. She pretended not to see it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n"How come that? You settin\' yere by\r\nyo\'se\'f, Calixta?" It was Bobin\xc3\xb4t who had\r\nfound her there alone. The dancers had not\r\nyet come out. She looked ghastly in the\r\nfaint, gray light struggling out of the east.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s me. Go yonda in the _parc aux petits_ an\' ask Aunt Olisse\r\nfu\' my hat. She knows w\'ere \'t is. I want to go home, me."\r\n\r\n"How you came?"\r\n\r\n"I come afoot, with the Cateaus. But I\'m goin\' now. I ent goin\' wait\r\nfu\' \'em. I\'m plumb we\' out, me."\r\n\r\n"Kin I go with you, Calixta?"\r\n\r\n"I don\' care."\r\n\r\nThey went together across the open prairie and along the edge of the\r\nfields, stumbling in the uncertain light. He told her to lift her dress\r\nthat was getting wet and bedraggled; for she was pulling at the weeds\r\nand grasses with her hands.\r\n\r\n"I don\' care; it\'s got to go in the tub, anyway. You been say in\' all\r\nalong you want to marry me, Bobin\xc3\xb4t. Well, if you want, yet, I don\'\r\ncare, me."\r\n\r\nThe glow of a sudden and overwhelming happiness shone out in the brown,\r\nrugged face of the young Acadian. He could not speak, for very joy. It\r\nchoked him.\r\n\r\n"Oh well, if you don\' want," snapped Calixta, flippantly, pretending to\r\nbe piqued at his silence.\r\n\r\n"_Bon Dieu!_ You know that makes me crazy, w\'at you sayin\'. You mean\r\nthat, Calixta? You ent goin\' turn roun\' agin?"\r\n\r\n"I neva tole you that much _yet_, Bobin\xc3\xb4t. I mean that. _Tiens_," and\r\nshe held out her hand in the business-like manner of a man who clinches\r\na bargain with a hand-clasp. Bobin\xc3\xb4t grew bold with happiness and asked\r\nCalixta to kiss him. She turned her face, that was almost ugly after\r\nthe night\'s dissipation, and looked steadily into his.\r\n\r\n"I don\' want to kiss you, Bobin\xc3\xb4t," she said, turning away again, "not\r\nto-day. Some other time. _Bont\xc3\xa9 divine!_ ent you satisfy, _yet_!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m satisfy, Calixta," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRiding through a patch of wood, Clarisse\'s saddle became ungirted, and\r\nshe and Alc\xc3\xa9e dismounted to readjust it.\r\n\r\nFor the twentieth time he asked her what had happened at home.\r\n\r\n"But, Clarisse, w\'at is it? Is it a misfortune?"\r\n\r\n"Ah Dieu sait! It\'s only something that happen\' to me."\r\n\r\n"To you!"\r\n\r\n"I saw you go away las\' night, Alc\xc3\xa9e, with those saddle-bags," she\r\nsaid, haltingly, striving to arrange something about the saddle, "an\' I\r\nmade Bruce tell me. He said you had gone to the ball, an\' wouldn\' be\r\nhome for weeks an\' weeks. I thought, Alc\xc3\xa9e--maybe you were going to--to\r\nAssumption. I got wild. An\' then I knew if you did n\'t come back,\r\n_now_, to-night, I could n\'t stan\' it,--again."\r\n\r\nShe had her face hidden in her arm that she was resting against the\r\nsaddle when she said that.\r\n\r\nHe began to wonder if this meant love. But she had to tell him so,\r\nbefore he believed it. And when she told him, he thought the face of\r\nthe Universe was changed--just like Bobin\xc3\xb4t. Was it last week the\r\ncyclone had well-nigh ruined him? The cyclone seemed a huge joke, now.\r\nIt was he, then, who, an hour ago was kissing little Calixta\'s ear and\r\nwhispering nonsense into it. Calixta was like a myth, now. The one,\r\nonly, great reality in the world was Clarisse standing before him,\r\ntelling him that she loved him.\r\n\r\nIn the distance they heard the rapid discharge of pistol-shots; but it\r\ndid not disturb them. They knew it was only the negro musicians who had\r\ngone into the yard to fire their pistols into the air, as the custom\r\nis, and to announce "_le bal est fini_."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BELLE ZORA\xc3\x8fDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer night was hot and still; not a ripple of air swept over the\r\nmarais. Yonder, across Bayou St. John, lights twinkled here and there\r\nin the darkness, and in the dark sky above a few stars were blinking. A\r\nlugger that had come out of the lake was moving with slow, lazy motion\r\ndown the bayou. A man in the boat was singing a song.\r\n\r\nThe notes of the song came faintly to the ears of old Manna Loulou,\r\nherself as black as the night, who had gone out upon the gallery to\r\nopen the shutters wide.\r\n\r\nSomething in the refrain reminded the woman of an old, half-forgotten\r\nCreole romance, and she began to sing it low to herself while she threw\r\nthe shutters open:--\r\n\r\n    "Lisett\' to kit\xc3\xa9 la plaine,\r\n    Mo perdi bonhair \xc3\xa0 mou\xc3\xa9;\r\n    Zi\xc3\xa9s \xc3\xa0 mou\xc3\xa9 sembl\xc3\xa9 fontaine,\r\n    D\xc3\xa9pi mo pa mir\xc3\xa9 tou\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\nAnd then this old song, a lover\'s lament for the loss of his mistress,\r\nfloating into her memory, brought with it the story she would tell to\r\nMadame, who lay in her sumptuous mahogany bed, waiting to be fanned and\r\nput to sleep to the sound of one of Manna Loulou\'s stories. The old\r\nnegress had already bathed her mistress\'s pretty white feet and kissed\r\nthem lovingly, one, then the other. She had brushed her mistress\'s\r\nbeautiful hair, that was as soft and shining as satin, and was the\r\ncolor of Madame\'s wedding-ring. Now, when she re\xc3\xabntered the room, she\r\nmoved softly toward the bed, and seating herself there began gently to\r\nfan Madame Delisle.\r\n\r\nManna Loulou was not always ready with her story, for Madame would hear\r\nnone but those which were true. But to-night the story was all there\r\nin Manna Loulou\'s head--the story of la belle Zora\xc3\xafde--and she told\r\nit to her mistress in the soft Creole patois, whose music and charm no\r\nEnglish words can convey.\r\n\r\nLa belle Zora\xc3\xafde had eyes that were so dusky, so beautiful, that any\r\nman who gazed too long into their depths was sure to lose his head,\r\nand even his heart sometimes. Her soft, smooth skin was the color of\r\n_caf\xc3\xa9-au-lait_.\r\n\r\nAs for her elegant manners, her _svelte_ and graceful figure, they\r\nwere the envy of half the ladies who visited her mistress, Madame\r\nDelarivi\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\n"No wonder Zora\xc3\xafde was as charming and as dainty as the finest lady of\r\nla rue Royale: from a toddling thing she had been brought up at her\r\nmistress\'s side; her fingers had never done rougher work than sewing a\r\nfine muslin seam; and she even had her own little black servant to wait\r\nupon her. Madame, who was her godmother as well as her mistress, would\r\noften say to her:--\r\n\r\n"\'Remember, Zora\xc3\xafde, when you are ready to marry, it must be in a way\r\nto do honor to your bringing up. It will be at the Cathedral. Your\r\nwedding gown, your corbeille, all will be of the best; I shall see to\r\nthat myself. You know, M\'sieur Ambroise is ready whenever you say the\r\nword; and his master is willing to do as much for him as I shall do for\r\nyou. It is a union that will please me in every way.\'\r\n\r\nM\'sieur Ambroise was then the body servant of Doctor Langl\xc3\xa9. La belle\r\nZora\xc3\xafde detested the little mulatto, with his shining whiskers like\r\na white man\'s, and his small eyes, that were cruel and false as a\r\nsnake\'s. She would cast down her own mischievous eyes, and say:--\r\n\r\n"\'Ah, n\xc3\xa9naine, I am so happy, so contented here at your side just as I\r\nam. I don\'t want to marry now; next year, perhaps, or the next.\' And\r\nMadame would smile indulgently and remind Zora\xc3\xafde that a woman\'s charms\r\nare not everlasting.\r\n\r\n"But the truth of the matter was, Zora\xc3\xafde had seen le beau M\xc3\xa9zor dance\r\nthe Bamboula in Congo Square. That was a sight to hold one rooted\r\nto the ground. M\xc3\xa9zor was as straight as a cypress-tree and as proud\r\nlooking as a king. His body, bare to the waist, was like a column of\r\nebony and it glistened like oil.\r\n\r\n"Poor Zora\xc3\xafde\'s heart grew sick in her bosom with love for le beau\r\nM\xc3\xa9zor from the moment she saw the fierce gleam of his eye, lighted by\r\nthe inspiring strains of the Bamboula, and beheld the stately movements\r\nof his splendid body swaying and quivering through the figures of the\r\ndance.\r\n\r\n"But when she knew him later, and he came near her to speak with her,\r\nall the fierceness was gone out of his eyes, and she saw only kindness\r\nin them and heard only gentleness in his voice; for love had taken\r\npossession of him also, and Zora\xc3\xafde was more distracted than ever.\r\nWhen M\xc3\xa9zor was not dancing Bamboula in Congo Square, he was hoeing\r\nsugar-cane, barefooted and half naked, in his master\'s field outside of\r\nthe city. Doctor Langl\xc3\xa9 was his master as well as M\'sieur Ambroise\'s.\r\n\r\n"One day, when Zora\xc3\xafde kneeled before her mistress, drawing on Madame\'s\r\nsilken stockings, that were of the finest, she said: "\'N\xc3\xa9naine, you\r\nhave spoken to me often of marrying. Now, at last, I have chosen a\r\nhusband, but it is not M\'sieur Ambroise; it is le beau M\xc3\xa9zor that I\r\nwant and no other.\' And Zora\xc3\xafde hid her face in her hands when she\r\nhad said that, for she guessed, rightly enough, that her mistress\r\nwould be very angry. And, indeed, Madame Delarivi\xc3\xa8re was at first\r\nspeechless with rage. When she finally spoke it was only to gasp out,\r\nexasperated:--\r\n\r\n"\'That negro! that negro! Bon Dieu Seigneur, but this is too much!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Am I white, n\xc3\xa9naine?\' pleaded Zora\xc3\xafde.\r\n\r\n"\'You white! _Malheureuse!_ You deserve to have the lash laid upon\r\nyou like any other slave; you have proven yourself no better than the\r\nworst.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am not white,\' persisted Zora\xc3\xafde, respectfully and gently. \'Doctor\r\nLangl\xc3\xa9 gives me his slave to marry, but he would not give me his son.\r\nThen, since I am not white, let me have from out of my own race the one\r\nwhom my heart has chosen.\'\r\n\r\n"However, you may well believe that Madame would not hear to that.\r\nZora\xc3\xafde was forbidden to speak to M\xc3\xa9zor, and M\xc3\xa9zor was cautioned\r\nagainst seeing Zora\xc3\xafde again. But you know how the negroes are,\r\nMa\'z\xc3\xa9lle Titite," added Manna Loulou, smiling a little sadly. "There\r\nis no mistress, no master, no king nor priest who can hinder them from\r\nloving when they will. And these two found ways and means.\r\n\r\n"When months had passed by, Zora\xc3\xafde, who had grown unlike\r\nherself,--sober and preoccupied,--said again to her mistress:--\r\n\r\n"\'N\xc3\xa9naine, you would not let me have M\xc3\xa9zor for my husband; but I have\r\ndisobeyed you, I have sinned. Kill me if you wish, n\xc3\xa9naine: forgive me\r\nif you will; but when I heard le beau M\xc3\xa9zor say to me, "Zora\xc3\xafde, mo\r\nl\'aime toi," I could have died, but I could not have helped loving him.\'\r\n\r\n"This time Madame Delarivi\xc3\xa8re was so actually pained, so wounded at\r\nhearing Zora\xc3\xafde\'s confession, that there was no place left in her\r\nheart for anger. She could utter only confused reproaches. But she was\r\na woman of action rather than of words, and she acted promptly. Her\r\nfirst step was to induce Doctor Langl\xc3\xa9 to sell M\xc3\xa9zor. Doctor Langl\xc3\xa9,\r\nwho was a widower, had long wanted to marry Madame Delarivi\xc3\xa8re, and\r\nhe would willingly have walked on all fours at noon through the Place\r\nd\'Armes if she wanted him to. Naturally he lost no time in disposing of\r\nle beau M\xc3\xa9zor, who was sold away into Georgia, or the Carolinas, or one\r\nof those distant countries far away, where he would no longer hear his\r\nCreole tongue spoken, nor dance Calinda, nor hold la belle Zora\xc3\xafde in\r\nhis arms.\r\n\r\n"The poor thing was heartbroken when M\xc3\xa9zor was sent away from her, but\r\nshe took comfort and hope in the thought of her baby that she would\r\nsoon be able to clasp to her breast.\r\n\r\n"La belle Zora\xc3\xafde\'s sorrows had now begun in earnest. Not only sorrows\r\nbut sufferings, and with the anguish of maternity came the shadow of\r\ndeath. But there is no agony that a mother will not forget when she\r\nholds her first-born to her heart, and presses her lips upon the baby\r\nflesh that is her own, yet far more precious than her own.\r\n\r\n"So, instinctively, when Zora\xc3\xafde came out of the awful shadow she gazed\r\nquestioningly about her and felt with her trembling hands upon either\r\nside of her. \'O\xc3\xb9 li, mo piti a moin? where is my little one?\' she asked\r\nimploringly. Madame who was there and the nurse who was there both told\r\nher in turn, \'To piti \xc3\xa0 toi, li mouri\' (\'Your little one is dead\'),\r\nwhich was a wicked falsehood that must have caused the angels in\r\nheaven to weep. For the baby was living and well and strong. It had at\r\nonce been removed from its mother\'s side, to be sent away to Madame\'s\r\nplantation, far up the coast. Zora\xc3\xafde could only moan in reply, \'Li\r\nmouri, li mouri,\' and she turned her face to the wall.\r\n\r\n"Madame had hoped, in thus depriving Zora\xc3\xafde of her child, to have her\r\nyoung waiting-maid again at her side free, happy, and beautiful as of\r\nold. But there was a more powerful will than Madame\'s at work--the\r\nwill of the good God, who had already designed that Zora\xc3\xafde should\r\ngrieve with a sorrow that was never more to be lifted in this world.\r\nLa belle Zora\xc3\xafde was no more. In her stead was a sad-eyed woman who\r\nmourned night and day for her baby. \'Li mouri, li mouri,\' she would\r\nsigh over and over again to those about her, and to herself when others\r\ngrew weary of her complaint.\r\n\r\n"Yet, in spite of all, M\'sieur Ambroise was still in the notion to\r\nmarry her. A sad wife or a merry one was all the same to him so long as\r\nthat wife was Zora\xc3\xafde. And she seemed to consent, or rather submit, to\r\nthe approaching marriage as though nothing mattered any longer in this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"One day, a black servant entered a little noisily the room in which\r\nZora\xc3\xafde sat sewing. With a look of strange and vacuous happiness upon\r\nher face, Zora\xc3\xafde arose hastily. \'Hush, hush,\' she whispered, lifting a\r\nwarning finger, \'my little one is asleep; you must not awaken her.\'\r\n\r\n"Upon the bed was a senseless bundle of rags shaped like an infant in\r\nswaddling clothes. Over this dummy the woman had drawn the mosquito\r\nbar, and she was sitting contentedly beside it. In short, from that day\r\nZora\xc3\xafde was demented. Night nor day did she lose sight of the doll that\r\nlay in her bed or in her arms.\r\n\r\n"And now was Madame stung with sorrow and remorse at seeing this\r\nterrible affliction that had befallen her dear Zora\xc3\xafde. Consulting with\r\nDoctor Langl\xc3\xa9, they decided to bring back to the mother the real baby\r\nof flesh and blood that was now toddling about, and kicking its heels\r\nin the dust yonder upon the plantation.\r\n\r\n"It was Madame herself who led the pretty, tiny little "griffe" girl to\r\nher mother. Zora\xc3\xafde was sitting upon a stone bench in the courtyard,\r\nlistening to the soft splashing of the fountain, and watching the\r\nfitful shadows of the palm leaves upon the broad, white flagging.\r\n\r\n"\'Here,\' said Madame, approaching, \'here, my poor dear Zora\xc3\xafde, is your\r\nown little child. Keep her; she is yours. No one will ever take her\r\nfrom you again.\'\r\n\r\n"Zora\xc3\xafde looked with sullen suspicion upon her mistress and the child\r\nbefore her. Reaching out a hand she thrust the little one mistrustfully\r\naway from her. With the other hand she clasped the rag bundle fiercely\r\nto her breast; for she suspected a plot to deprive her of it.\r\n\r\n"Nor could she ever be induced to let her own child approach her; and\r\nfinally the little one was sent back to the plantation, where she was\r\nnever to know the love of mother or father.\r\n\r\n"And now this is the end of Zora\xc3\xafde\'s story. She was never known again\r\nas la belle Zora\xc3\xafde, but ever after as Zora\xc3\xafde la folle, whom no one\r\never wanted to marry--not even M\'sieur Ambroise. She lived to be an old\r\nwoman, whom some people pitied and others laughed at--always clasping\r\nher bundle of rags--her \'piti.\'\r\n\r\n"Are you asleep, Ma\'z\xc3\xa9lle Titite?"\r\n\r\n"No, I am not asleep; I was thinking. Ah, the poor little one, Man\r\nLoulou, the poor little one! better had she died!"\r\n\r\nBut this is the way Madame Delisle and Manna Loulou really talked to\r\neach other:--\r\n\r\n"Vou pr\xc3\xa9 droumi, Ma\'z\xc3\xa9lle Titite?"\r\n\r\n"Non, pa pr\xc3\xa9 droumi; mo yapr\xc3\xa9 zongler. Ah, la pauv\' piti, Man Loulou.\r\nLa pauv\' piti! Mieux li mouri!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GENTLEMAN OF BAYOU T\xc3\x8aCHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder Mr. Sublet, who was staying at the Hallet plantation,\r\nwanted to make a picture of Evariste. The \'Cadian was rather a\r\npicturesque subject in his way, and a tempting one to an artist looking\r\nfor bits of "local color" along the T\xc3\xaache.\r\n\r\nMr. Sublet had seen the man on the back gallery just as he came out of\r\nthe swamp, trying to sell a wild turkey to the house-keeper. He spoke\r\nto him at once, and in the course of conversation engaged him to return\r\nto the house the following morning and have his picture drawn. He\r\nhanded Evariste a couple of silver dollars to show that his intentions\r\nwere fair, and that he expected the \'Cadian to keep faith with him.\r\n\r\n"He tell\' me he want\' put my picture in one fine \'_Mag_\'zine,\'" said\r\nEvariste to his daughter, Martinette, when the two were talking the\r\nmatter over in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n"W\'at fo\' you reckon he want\' do dat?" They sat within the low, homely\r\ncabin of two rooms, that was not quite so comfortable as Mr. Hallet\'s\r\nnegro quarters.\r\n\r\nMartinette pursed her red lips that had little sensitive curves to\r\nthem, and her black eyes took on a reflective expression.\r\n\r\n"Mebbe he yeard \'bout that big fish w\'at you ketch las\' winta in\r\nCarancro lake. You know it was all wrote about in the \'Suga Bowl.\'" Her\r\nfather set aside the suggestion with a deprecatory wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, you got to fix yo\'se\'f up," declared Martinette,\r\ndismissing further speculation; "put on yo\' otha pant\'loon\' an\' yo\'\r\ngood coat; an\' you betta ax Mr. L\xc3\xa9once to cut yo\' hair, an\' yo\' w\'sker\'\r\na li\'le bit."\r\n\r\n"It\'s w\'at I say," chimed in Evariste. "I tell dat gent\'man I\'m goin\'\r\nmake myse\'f fine. He say\', \'No, no,\' like he ent please\'. He want\' me\r\nlike I come out de swamp. So much betta if my pant\'loon\' an\' coat is\r\ntore, he-say, an\' color\' like de mud." They could not understand these\r\neccentric wishes on the part of the strange gentleman, and made no\r\neffort to do so.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Martinette, who was quite puffed up over the affair,\r\ntrotted across to Aunt Dicey\'s cabin to communicate the news to her.\r\nThe negress was ironing; her irons stood in a long row before the fire\r\nof logs that burned on the hearth. Martinette seated herself in the\r\nchimney corner and held her feet up to the blaze; it was damp and a\r\nlittle chilly out of doors. The girl\'s shoes were considerably worn and\r\nher garments were a little too thin and scant for the winter season.\r\nHer father had given her the two dollars he had received from the\r\nartist, and Martinette was on her way to the store to invest them as\r\njudiciously as she knew how.\r\n\r\n"You know, Aunt Dicey," she began a little complacently after listening\r\nawhile to Aunt Dicey\'s unqualified abuse of her own son, Wilkins, who\r\nwas dining-room boy at Mr. Hallet\'s, "you know that stranger gentleman\r\nup to Mr. Hallet\'s? he want\' to make my popa\'s picture; an\' he say\'\r\nhe goin\' put it in one fine Mag\'zine yonda." Aunt Dicey spat upon her\r\niron to test its heat. Then she began to snicker. She kept on laughing\r\ninwardly, making her whole fat body shake, and saying nothing.\r\n\r\n"W\'at you laughin\' \'bout, Aunt Dice?" inquired Martinette mistrustfully.\r\n\r\n"I is n\' laughin\', chile!"\r\n\r\n"Yas, you\' laughin\'."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t pay no \'tention to me. I jis studyin\' how simple you an\' yo\'\r\npa is. You is bof de simplest somebody I eva come \'crost."\r\n\r\n"You got to say plumb out w\'at you mean, Aunt Dice," insisted the girl\r\ndoggedly, suspicious and alert now.\r\n\r\n"Well, dat w\'y I say you is simple," proclaimed the woman, slamming\r\ndown her iron on an inverted, battered pie pan, "jis like you says,\r\ndey gwine put yo\' pa\'s picture yonda in de picture paper. An\' you know\r\nw\'at readin\' dey gwine sot down on\'neaf dat picture?" Martinette was\r\nintensely attentive. "Dey gwine sot down on\'neaf: \'Dis heah is one dem\r\nlow-down \'Cajuns o\' Bayeh T\xc3\xaache!"\'\r\n\r\nThe blood flowed from Martinette\'s face, leaving it deathly pale; in\r\nanother instant it came beating back in a quick flood, and her eyes\r\nsmarted with pain as if the tears that filled them had been fiery hot.\r\n\r\n"I knows dem kine o\' folks," continued Aunt Dicey, resuming her\r\ninterrupted ironing. "Dat stranger he got a li\'le boy w\'at ain\'t none\r\ntoo big to spank. Dat li\'le imp he come a hoppin\' in heah yistiddy wid\r\na kine o\' box on\'neaf his arm. He say\' \'Good mo\'nin\', madam. Will you\r\nbe so kine an\' stan\' jis like you is dah at yo\' i\'onin\', an\' lef me\r\ntake yo\' picture?\' I \'lowed I gwine make a picture outen him wid dis\r\nheah flat-i\'on, ef he don\' d\'ar hisse\'f quick. An\' he say he baig my\r\npardon fo\' his intrudement. All dat kine o\' talk to a ole nigga \'oman!\r\nDat plainly sho\' he don\' know his place."\r\n\r\n"W\'at you want \'im to say, Aunt Dice?" asked Martinette, with an effort\r\nto conceal her distress.\r\n\r\n"I wants \'im to come in heah an\' say: \'Howdy, Aunt Dicey! will you be\r\nso kine and go put on yo\' noo calker dress an\' yo\' bonnit w\'at you\r\nw\'ars to meetin\', an\' stan\' \'side f\'om dat i\'onin\'-boa\'d w\'ilse I\r\ngwine take yo\' photygraph.\' Dat de way fo\' a boy to talk w\'at had good\r\nraisin\'."\r\n\r\nMartinette had arisen, and began to take slow leave of the woman. She\r\nturned at the cabin door to observe tentatively: "I reckon it\'s Wilkins\r\ntells you how the folks they talk, yonda up to Mr. Hallet\'s."\r\n\r\nShe did not go to the store as she had intended, but walked with a\r\ndragging step back to her home. The silver dollars clicked in her\r\npocket as she walked. She felt like flinging them across the field;\r\nthey seemed to her somehow the price of shame.\r\n\r\nThe sun had sunk, and twilight was settling like a silver beam upon\r\nthe bayou and enveloping the fields in a gray mist. Evariste, slim and\r\nslouchy, was waiting for his daughter in the cabin door. He had lighted\r\na fire of sticks and branches, and placed the kettle before it to boil.\r\nHe met the girl with his slow, serious, questioning eyes, astonished to\r\nsee her empty-handed.\r\n\r\n"How come you didn\' bring nuttin\' f\'om de sto\', Martinette?"\r\n\r\nShe entered and flung her gingham sun-bonnet upon a chair. "No, I didn\'\r\ngo yonda;" and with sudden exasperation: "You got to go take back that\r\nmoney; you mus\' n\' git no picture took."\r\n\r\n"But, Martinette," her father mildly interposed, "I promise\' \'im; an\'\r\nhe\'s goin\' give me some mo\' money w\'en he finish."\r\n\r\n"If he give you a ba\'el o\' money, you mus\' n\' git no picture took. You\r\nknow w\'at he want to put un\'neath that picture, fo\' ev\'body to read?"\r\nShe could not tell him the whole hideous truth as she had heard it\r\ndistorted from Aunt Dicey\'s lips; she would not hurt him that much.\r\n"He\'s goin\' to write: \'This is one \'_Cajun_ o\' the Bayou T\xc3\xaache.\'"\r\nEvariste winced.\r\n\r\n"How you know?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I yeard so. I know it\'s true."\r\n\r\nThe water in the kettle was boiling. He went and poured a small\r\nquantity upon the coffee which he had set there to drip. Then he said\r\nto her: "I reckon you jus\' as well go care dat two dolla\' back, tomo\'\r\nmo\'nin\'; me, I\'ll go yonda ketch a mess o\' fish in Carancro lake."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Hallet and a few masculine companions were assembled at a rather\r\nlate breakfast the following morning. The dining-room was a big, bare\r\none, enlivened by a cheerful fire of logs that blazed in the wide\r\nchimney on massive andirons. There were guns, fishing tackle, and\r\nother implements of sport lying about. A couple of fine dogs strayed\r\nunceremoniously in and out behind Wilkins, the negro boy who waited\r\nupon the table. The chair beside Mr. Sublet, usually occupied by his\r\nlittle son, was vacant, as the child had gone for an early morning\r\nouting and had not yet returned.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was about half over, Mr. Hallet noticed Martinette\r\nstanding outside upon the gallery. The dining-room door had stood open\r\nmore than half the time.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that Martinette out there, Wilkins" inquired the jovial-faced\r\nyoung planter.\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s who, suh," returned Wilkins. "She ben standin\' dah sence mos\'\r\nsun-up; look like she studyin\' to take root to de gall\'ry."\r\n\r\n"What in the name of goodness does she want? Ask her what she wants.\r\nTell her to come in to the fire."\r\n\r\nMartinette walked into the room with much hesitancy. Her small, brown\r\nface could hardly be seen in the depths of the gingham sun-bonnet. Her\r\nblue cottonade skirt scarcely, reached the thin ankles that it should\r\nhave covered.\r\n\r\n"Bonjou\'," she murmured, with a little comprehensive nod that took\r\nin the entire company. Her eyes searched the table for the "stranger\r\ngentleman," and she knew him at once, because his hair was parted in\r\nthe middle and he wore a pointed beard. She went and laid the two\r\nsilver dollars beside his plate and motioned to retire without a word\r\nof explanation.\r\n\r\n"Hold on, Martinette!" called out the planter, "what\'s all this\r\npantomime business? Speak out, little one."\r\n\r\n"My popa don\'t want any picture took," she offered, a little\r\ntimorously. On her way to the door she had looked back to say this. In\r\nthat fleeting glance she detected a smile of intelligence pass from one\r\nto the other of the group. She turned quickly, facing them all, and\r\nspoke out, excitement making her voice bold and shrill: "My popa ent\r\none low-down \'Cajun. He ent goin\' to stan\' to have that kine o\' writin\'\r\nput down un\'neath his picture!"\r\n\r\nShe almost ran from the room, half blinded by the emotion that had\r\nhelped her to make so daring a speech.\r\n\r\nDescending the gallery steps she ran full against her father who was\r\nascending, bearing in his arms the little boy, Archie Sublet. The\r\nchild was most grotesquely attired in garments far too large for his\r\ndiminutive person--the rough jeans clothing of some negro boy. Evariste\r\nhimself had evidently been taking a bath without the preliminary\r\nceremony of removing his clothes, that were now half dried upon his\r\nperson by the wind and sun.\r\n\r\n"Yere you\' li\'le boy," he announced, stumbling into the room. "You\r\nought not lef dat li\'le chile go by hisse\'f _comme \xc3\xa7a_ in de pirogue."\r\nMr. Sublet darted from his chair; the others following suit almost as\r\nhastily. In an instant, quivering with apprehension, he had his little\r\nson in his arms. The child was quite unharmed, only somewhat pale and\r\nnervous, as the consequence of a recent very serious ducking.\r\n\r\nEvariste related in his uncertain, broken English how he had been\r\nfishing for an hour or more in Carancro lake, when he noticed the boy\r\npaddling over the deep, black water in a shell-like pirogue. Nearing\r\na clump of cypress-trees that rose from the lake, the pirogue became\r\nentangled in the heavy moss that hung from the tree limbs and trailed\r\nupon the water. The next thing he knew, the boat had overturned, he\r\nheard the child scream, and saw him disappear beneath the still, black\r\nsurface of the lake.\r\n\r\n"W\'en I done swim to de sho\' wid \'im," continued Evariste, "I hurry\r\nyonda to Jake Baptiste\'s cabin, an\' we rub \'im an\' warm \'im up, an\'\r\ndress \'im up dry like you see. He all right now, M\'sieur; but you mus\'n\r\nlef \'im go no mo\' by hisse\'f in one pirogue."\r\n\r\nMartinette had followed into the room behind her father. She was\r\nfeeling and tapping his wet garments solicitously, and begging him in\r\nFrench to come home. Mr. Hallet at once ordered hot coffee and a warm\r\nbreakfast for the two; and they sat down at the corner of the table,\r\nmaking no manner of objection in their perfect simplicity. It was with\r\nvisible reluctance and ill-disguised contempt that Wilkins served them.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Sublet had arranged his son comfortably, with tender care,\r\nupon the sofa, and had satisfied himself that the child was quite\r\nuninjured, he attempted to find words with which to thank Evariste for\r\nthis service which no treasure of words or gold could pay for. These\r\nwarm and heartfelt expressions seemed to Evariste to exaggerate the\r\nimportance of his action, and they intimidated him. He attempted shyly\r\nto hide his face as well as he could in the depths of his bowl of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n"You will let me make your picture now, I hope, Evariste," begged Mr.\r\nSublet, laying his hand upon the \'Cadian\'s shoulder. "I want to place\r\nit among things I hold most dear, and shall call it \'A hero of Bayou\r\nT\xc3\xaache.\'" This assurance seemed to distress Evariste greatly.\r\n\r\n"No, no," he protested, "it\'s nuttin\' hero\' to take a li\'le boy out\r\nde water. I jus\' as easy do dat like I stoop down an\' pick up a li\'le\r\nchile w\'at fall down in de road. I ent goin\' to \'low dat, me. I don\'t\r\ngit no picture took, _va!_"\r\n\r\nMr. Hallet, who now discerned his friend\'s eagerness in the matter,\r\ncame to his aid.\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Evariste, let Mr. Sublet draw your picture, and you\r\nyourself may call it whatever you want. I\'m sure he \'ll let you."\r\n\r\n"Most willingly," agreed the artist.\r\n\r\nEvariste glanced up at him with shy and child-like pleasure. "It\'s a\r\nbargain?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A bargain," affirmed Mr. Sublet.\r\n\r\n"Popa," whispered Martinette, "you betta come-home an\' put on yo\' otha\r\npant\'loon\' an\' yo\' good coat."\r\n\r\n"And now, what shall we call the much talked-of picture?" cheerily\r\ninquired the planter, standing with his back to the blaze.\r\n\r\nEvariste in a business-like manner began carefully to trace on the\r\ntablecloth imaginary characters with an imaginary pen; he could not\r\nhave written the real characters with a real pen--he did not know how.\r\n\r\n"You will put on\'neat\' de picture," he said, deliberately, "\'Dis is\r\none picture of Mista Evariste Anatole Bonamour, a gent\'man of de Bayou\r\nT\xc3\xaache.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LADY OF BAYOU ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days and the nights were very lonely for Madame Delisle. Gustave,\r\nher husband, was away yonder in Virginia somewhere, with Beauregard,\r\nand she was here in the old house on Bayou St. John, alone with her\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nMadame was very beautiful. So beautiful, that she found much diversion\r\nin sitting for hours before the mirror, contemplating her own\r\nloveliness; admiring the brilliancy of her golden hair, the sweet\r\nlanguor of her blue eyes, the graceful contours of her figure, and the\r\npeach-like bloom of her flesh. She was very young. So young that she\r\nromped with the dogs, teased the parrot, and could not fall asleep at\r\nnight unless old black Manna-Loulou sat beside her bed and told her\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nIn short, she was a child, not able to realize the significance of\r\nthe tragedy whose unfolding kept the civilized world in suspense. It\r\nwas only the immediate effect of the awful drama that moved her: the\r\ngloom that, spreading on all sides, penetrated her own existence and\r\ndeprived it of joyousness.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9pincourt found her looking very lonely and disconsolate one day when\r\nhe stopped to talk with her. She was pale, and her blue eyes were dim\r\nwith unwept tears. He was a Frenchman who lived near by. He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders over this strife between brothers, this quarrel which was\r\nnone of his; and he resented it chiefly upon the ground that it made\r\nlife uncomfortable; yet he was young enough to have had quicker and\r\nhotter blood in his veins.\r\n\r\nWhen he left Madame Delisle that day, her eyes were no longer dim, and\r\na something of the dreariness that weighted her had been lifted away.\r\nThat mysterious, that treacherous bond called sympathy, had revealed\r\nthem to each other.\r\n\r\nHe came to her very often that summer, clad always in cool, white\r\nduck, with a flower in his buttonhole. His pleasant brown eyes sought\r\nhers with warm, friendly glances that comforted her as a caress might\r\ncomfort a disconsolate child. She took to watching for his slim figure,\r\na little bent, walking lazily up the avenue between the double line of\r\nmagnolias.\r\n\r\nThey would sit sometimes during whole afternoons in the vine-sheltered\r\ncorner of the gallery, sipping the black coffee that Manna-Loulou\r\nbrought to them at intervals; and talking, talking incessantly during\r\nthe first days when they were unconsciously unfolding themselves to\r\neach other. Then a time came--it came very quickly--when they seemed to\r\nhave nothing more to say to one another.\r\n\r\nHe brought her news of the war; and they talked about it listlessly,\r\nbetween long intervals of silence, of which neither took account. An\r\noccasional letter came by round-about ways from Gustave--guarded arid\r\nsaddening in its tone. They would read it and sigh over it together.\r\n\r\nOnce they stood before his portrait that hung in the drawing-room and\r\nthat looked out at them with kind, indulgent eyes. Madame wiped the\r\npicture with her gossamer handkerchief and impulsively pressed a tender\r\nkiss upon the painted canvas. For months past the living image of her\r\nhusband had been receding further and further into a mist which she\r\ncould penetrate with no faculty or power that she possessed.\r\n\r\nOne day at sunset, when she and S\xc3\xa9pincourt stood silently side by\r\nside, looking across the _marais_, aflame with the western light, he\r\nsaid to her: "_M\'amie_, let us go away from this country that is so\r\n_triste_. Let us go to Paris, you and me."\r\n\r\nShe thought that he was jesting, and she laughed nervously. "Yes, Paris\r\nwould surely be gayer than Bayou St. John," she answered. But he was\r\nnot jesting. She saw it at once in the glance that penetrated her own;\r\nin the quiver of his sensitive lip and the quick beating of a swollen\r\nvein in his brown throat.\r\n\r\n"Paris, or anywhere--with you--ah, _bon Dieu!_" he whispered, seizing\r\nher hands. But she withdrew from him, frightened, and hurried away into\r\nthe house, leaving him alone.\r\n\r\nThat night, for the first time, Madame did not want to hear\r\nManna-Loulou\'s stories, and she blew out the wax candle that till now\r\nhad burned nightly, in her sleeping-room, under its tall, crystal\r\nglobe. She had suddenly become a woman capable of love or sacrifice.\r\nShe would not hear Manna-Loulou\'s stories. She wanted to be alone, to\r\ntremble and to weep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning her eyes were dry, but she would not see S\xc3\xa9pincourt\r\nwhen he came. Then he wrote her a letter.\r\n\r\n"I have offended you and I would rather die!" it ran. "Do not banish me\r\nfrom your presence that is life to me. Let me lie at your feet, if only\r\nfor a moment, in which to hear you say that you forgive me."\r\n\r\nMen have written just such letters before, but Madame did not know it.\r\nTo her it was a voice from the unknown, like music, awaking in her a\r\ndelicious tumult that seized and held possession of her whole being.\r\n\r\nWhen they met, he had but to look into her face to know that he need\r\nnot lie at her feet craving forgiveness. She was waiting for him\r\nbeneath the spreading branches of a live-oak that guarded the gate of\r\nher home like a sentinel.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment he held her hands, which trembled. Then he folded\r\nher in his arms and kissed her many times. "You will go with me,\r\n_m\'amie_? I love you--oh, I love you! Will you not go with me,\r\n_m\'amie_?"\r\n\r\n"Anywhere, anywhere," she told him in a fainting voice that he could\r\nscarcely hear.\r\n\r\nBut she did not go with him. Chance willed it otherwise. That night\r\na courier brought her a message from Beauregard, telling her that\r\nGustave, her husband, was dead.\r\n\r\nWhen the new year was still young, S\xc3\xa9pincourt decided that, all things\r\nconsidered, he might, without any appearance of indecent haste, speak\r\nagain of his love to Madame Delisle. That love was quite as acute\r\nas ever; perhaps a little sharper, from the long period of silence\r\nand waiting to which he had subjected it. He found her, as he had\r\nexpected, clad in deepest mourning. She greeted him precisely as she\r\nhad welcomed the cur\xc3\xa9, when the kind old priest had brought to her the\r\nconsolations of religion--clasping his two hands warmly, and calling\r\nhim "cher ami." Her whole attitude and bearing brought to S\xc3\xa9pincourt\r\nthe poignant, the bewildering conviction that he held no place in her\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nThey sat in the drawing-room before the portrait of Gustave, which\r\nwas draped with his scarf. Above the picture hung his sword, and\r\nbeneath it was an embankment of flowers. S\xc3\xa9pincourt felt an almost\r\nirresistible impulse to bend his knee before this altar, upon which he\r\nsaw foreshadowed the immolation of his hopes.\r\n\r\nThere was a soft air blowing gently over the _marais_. It came to\r\nthem through the open window, laden with a hundred subtle sounds and\r\nscents of the springtime. It seemed to remind Madame of something\r\nfar, far away, for she gazed dreamily out into the blue firmament. It\r\nfretted S\xc3\xa9pincourt with impulses to speech and action which he found it\r\nimpossible to control.\r\n\r\n"You must know what has brought me," he began impulsively, drawing\r\nhis chair nearer to hers. "Through all these months I have never\r\nceased to love you and to long for you. Night and day the sound of\r\nyour dear voice has been with me; your eyes"--She held out her hand\r\ndeprecatingly. He took it and held it. She let it lie unresponsive in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n"You cannot have forgotten that you loved me not long ago," he went on\r\neagerly, "that you were ready to follow me anywhere,--anywhere; do you\r\nremember? I have come now to ask you to fulfill that promise; to ask\r\nyou toy be my wife, my companion, the dear treasure of my life."\r\n\r\nShe heard his warm and pleading tones as though listening to a strange\r\nlanguage, imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand from his, and leaned her brow thoughtfully upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Can you not feel--can you not understand, _mon ami_," she said calmly,\r\n"that now such a thing--such a thought, is impossible to me?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, impossible. Can you not see that now my heart, my soul, my\r\nthought--my very life, must belong to another? It could not be\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\n"Would you have me believe that you can wed your young existence to the\r\ndead?" he exclaimed with something like horror. Her glance was sunk\r\ndeep in the embankment of flowers before her.\r\n\r\n"My husband has never been so living to me as he is now," she replied\r\nwith a faint smile of commiseration for S\xc3\xa9pincourt\'s fatuity. "Every\r\nobject that surrounds me speaks to me of him. I look yonder across\r\nthe _marais_, and I see him coming toward me, tired and toil-stained\r\nfrom the hunt. I see him again sitting in this chair or in that one.\r\nI hear his familiar voice, his footsteps upon the galleries. We walk\r\nonce more together beneath the magnolias; and at night in dreams I feel\r\nthat he is there, there, near me. How could it be different! Ah! I\r\nhave memories, memories to crowd and fill my life, if I live a hundred\r\nyears!"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9pincourt was wondering why she did not take the sword down from her\r\naltar and thrust it through his body here and there. The effect would\r\nhave been infinitely more agreeable than her words, penetrating his\r\nsoul like fire. He arose confused, enraged with pain.\r\n\r\n"Then, Madame," he stammered, "there is nothing left for me but to take\r\nmy leave. I bid you adieu."\r\n\r\n"Do not be offended, _mon ami_," she said kindly, holding out her hand.\r\n"You are going to Paris, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"What does it matter," he exclaimed desperately, "where I go?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I only wanted to wish you _bon voyage_" she assured him amiably.\r\n\r\nMany days after that S\xc3\xa9pincourt spent in the fruitless mental effort of\r\ntrying to comprehend that psychological enigma, a woman\'s heart.\r\n\r\nMadame still lives on Bayou St. John. She is rather an old lady now, a\r\nvery pretty old lady, against whose long years of widowhood there has\r\nnever been a breath of reproach. The memory of Gustave still fills and\r\nsatisfies her days. She has never failed, once a year, to have a solemn\r\nhigh mass said for the repose of his soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bayou Folk, by Kate Chopin\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BAYOU FOLK ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 46650-0.txt or 46650-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/6/6/5/46650/\r\n\r\nProduced by Marc D\'Hooghe at http://www.freeliterature.org\r\n(Images generously made available by the Internet Archive.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
