The villa was famous for the fine\r\nview from its terrace. The hidden garden in which the four men sat at\r\ntable lay some twenty feet below the south end of this terrace, and was\r\na mere shelf of rock, overhanging a steep declivity planted with\r\nvineyards. A flight of stone steps connected it with the promenade\r\nabove. The table stood in a sanded square, among potted orange and\r\noleander trees, shaded by spreading ilex oaks that grew out of the rocks\r\noverhead. Beyond the balustrade was the drop into the air, and far below\r\nthe landscape stretched soft and undulating; there was nothing to arrest\r\nthe eye until it reached Rome itself.\r\n\r\nIt was early when the Spanish Cardinal and his guests sat down to\r\ndinner. The sun was still good for an hour of supreme splendour, and\r\nacross the shining folds of country the low profile of the city barely\r\nfretted the sky-line--indistinct except for the dome of St. Peter\'s,\r\nbluish grey like the flattened top of a great balloon, just a flash of\r\ncopper light on its soft metallic surface. The Cardinal had an eccentric\r\npreference for beginning his dinner at this time in the late afternoon,\r\nwhen the vehemence of the sun suggested motion. The light was full of\r\naction and had a peculiar quality of climax--of splendid finish. It was\r\nboth intense and soft, with a ruddiness as of much-multiplied\r\ncandlelight, an aura of red in its flames. It bored into the ilex trees,\r\nilluminating their mahogany trunks and blurring their dark foliage; it\r\nwarmed the bright green of the orange trees and the rose of the oleander\r\nblooms to gold; sent congested spiral patterns quivering over the damask\r\nand plate and crystal. The churchmen kept their rectangular clerical\r\ncaps on their heads to protect them from the sun. The three Cardinals\r\nwore black cassocks with crimson pipings and crimson buttons, the Bishop\r\na long black coat over his violet vest.\r\n\r\nThey were talking business; had met, indeed, to discuss an anticipated\r\nappeal from the Provincial Council at Baltimore for the founding of an\r\nApostolic Vicarate in New Mexico--a part of North America recently\r\nannexed to the United States. This new territory was vague to all of\r\nthem, even to the missionary Bishop. The Italian and French Cardinals\r\nspoke of it as _Le Mexique_, and the Spanish host referred to it as "New\r\nSpain." Their interest in the projected Vicarate was tepid, and had to\r\nbe continually revived by the missionary, Father Ferrand; Irish by\r\nbirth, French by ancestry--a man of wide wanderings and notable\r\nachievement in the New World, an Odysseus of the Church. The language\r\nspoken was French--the time had already gone by when Cardinals could\r\nconveniently discuss contemporary matters in Latin.\r\n\r\nThe French and Italian Cardinals were men in vigorous middle life--the\r\nNorman full-belted and ruddy, the Venetian spare and sallow and\r\nhook-nosed. Their host, Garcia Maria de Allande, was still a young man.\r\nHe was dark in colouring, but the long Spanish face, that looked out\r\nfrom so many canvases in his ancestral portrait gallery, was in the\r\nyoung Cardinal much modified through his English mother. With his\r\n_caff\xc3\xa8 oscuro_ eyes, he had a fresh, pleasant English mouth, and an\r\nopen manner.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of the reign of Gregory XVI, de Allande had been\r\nthe most influential man at the Vatican; but since the death of Gregory,\r\ntwo years ago, he had retired to his country estate. He believed the\r\nreforms of the new Pontiff impractical and dangerous, and had withdrawn\r\nfrom politics, confining his activities to work for the Society for the\r\nPropagation of the Faith--that organization which had been so fostered\r\nby Gregory. In his leisure the Cardinal played tennis. As a boy, in\r\nEngland, he had been passionately fond of this sport. Lawn tennis had\r\nnot yet come into fashion; it was a formidable game of indoor tennis the\r\nCardinal played. Amateurs of that violent sport came from Spain and\r\nFrance to try their skill against him.\r\n\r\nThe missionary, Bishop Ferrand, looked much older than any of them, old\r\nand rough--except for his clear, intensely blue eyes. His diocese lay\r\nwithin the icy arms of the Great Lakes, and on his long, lonely\r\nhorseback rides among his missions the sharp winds had bitten him well.\r\nThe missionary was here for a purpose, and he pressed his point. He ate\r\nmore rapidly than the others and had plenty of time to plead his\r\ncause,--finished each course with such dispatch that the Frenchman\r\nremarked he would have been an ideal dinner companion for Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop laughed and threw out his brown hands in apology. "Likely\r\nenough I have forgot my manners. I am preoccupied. Here you can scarcely\r\nunderstand what it means that the United States has annexed that\r\nenormous territory which was the cradle of the Faith in the New World.\r\nThe Vicarate of New Mexico will be in a few years raised to an Episcopal\r\nSee, with jurisdiction over a country larger than Central and Western\r\nEurope, barring Russia. The Bishop of that See will direct the beginning\r\nof momentous things."\r\n\r\n"Beginnings," murmured the Venetian, "there have been so many. But\r\nnothing ever comes from over there but trouble and appeals for money."\r\n\r\nThe missionary turned to him patiently. "Your Eminence, I beg you to\r\nfollow me. This country was evangelized in fifteen hundred, by the\r\nFranciscan Fathers. It has been allowed to drift for nearly three\r\nhundred years and is not yet dead. It still pitifully calls itself a\r\nCatholic country, and tries to keep the forms of religion without\r\ninstruction. The old mission churches are in ruins. The few priests are\r\nwithout guidance or discipline. They are lax in religious observance,\r\nand some of them live in open concubinage. If this Augean stable is not\r\ncleansed, now that the territory has been taken over by a progressive\r\ngovernment, it will prejudice the interests of the Church in the whole\r\nof North America."\r\n\r\n"But these missions are still under the jurisdiction of Mexico, are they\r\nnot?" inquired the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n"In the See of the Bishop of Durango?" added Maria de Allande.\r\n\r\nThe missionary sighed. "Your Eminence, the Bishop of Durango is an old\r\nman; and from his seat to Santa F\xc3\xa9 is a distance of fifteen hundred\r\nEnglish miles. There are no wagon roads, no canals, no navigable rivers.\r\nTrade is carried on by means of pack-mules, over treacherous trails. The\r\ndesert down there has a peculiar horror; I do not mean thirst, nor\r\nIndian massacres, which are frequent. The very floor of the world is\r\ncracked open into countless canyons and arroyos, fissures in the earth\r\nwhich are sometimes ten feet deep, sometimes a thousand. Up and down\r\nthese stony chasms the traveller and his mules clamber as best they can.\r\nIt is impossible to go far in any direction without crossing them. If\r\nthe Bishop of Durango should summon a disobedient priest by letter, who\r\nshall bring the Padre to him? Who can prove that he ever received the\r\nsummons? The post is carried by hunters, fur trappers, gold seekers,\r\nwhoever happens to be moving on the trails."\r\n\r\nThe Norman Cardinal emptied his glass and wiped his lips.\r\n\r\n"And the inhabitants, Father Ferrand? If these are the travellers, who\r\nstays at home?"\r\n\r\n"Some thirty Indian nations, Monsignor, each with its own customs and\r\nlanguage, many of them fiercely hostile to each other. And the Mexicans,\r\na naturally devout people. Untaught and unshepherded, they cling to the\r\nfaith of their fathers."\r\n\r\n"I have a letter from the Bishop of Durango, recommending his Vicar for\r\nthis new post," remarked Maria de Allande.\r\n\r\n"Your Eminence, it would be a great misfortune if a native priest were\r\nappointed; they have never done well in that field. Besides, this Vicar\r\nis old. The new Vicar must be a young man, of strong constitution, full\r\nof zeal, and above all, intelligent. He will have to deal with savagery\r\nand ignorance, with dissolute priests and political intrigue. He must be\r\na man to whom order is necessary--as dear as life."\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard\'s coffee-coloured eyes showed a glint of yellow as he\r\nglanced sidewise at his guest. "I suspect, from your exordium, that you\r\nhave a candidate--and that he is a French priest, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"You guess rightly, Monsignor. I am glad to see that we have the same\r\nopinion of French missionaries."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Cardinal lightly, "they are the best missionaries. Our\r\nSpanish fathers made good martyrs, but the French Jesuits accomplish\r\nmore. They are the great organizers."\r\n\r\n"Better than the Germans?" asked the Venetian, who had Austrian\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the Germans classify, but the French arrange! The French\r\nmissionaries have a sense of proportion and rational adjustment. They\r\nare always trying to discover the logical relation of things. It is a\r\npassion with them." Here the host turned to the old Bishop again. "But\r\nyour Grace, why do you neglect this Burgundy? I had this wine brought up\r\nfrom my cellar especially to warm away the chill of your twenty Canadian\r\nwinters. Surely, you do not gather vintages like, this on the shores of\r\nthe Great Lake Huron?"\r\n\r\nThe missionary smiled as he took up his untouched glass. "It is superb,\r\nyour Eminence, but I fear I have lost my palate for vintages. Out there,\r\na little whisky, or Hudson Bay Company rum, does better for us. I must\r\nconfess I enjoyed the champagne in Paris. We had been forty days at sea,\r\nand I am a poor sailor."\r\n\r\n"Then we must have some for you." He made a sign to his major-domo. "You\r\nlike it very cold? And your new Vicar Apostolic, what will he drink in\r\nthe country of bison and _serpents \xc3\xa0 sonnettes_? And what will he eat?"\r\n\r\n"He will eat dried buffalo meat and frijoles with chili, and he will be\r\nglad to drink water when he can get it. He will have no easy life, your\r\nEminence. That country will drink up his youth and strength as it does\r\nthe rain. He will be called upon for every sacrifice, quite possibly for\r\nmartyrdom. Only last year the Indian pueblo of San Fernandez de Taos\r\nmurdered and scalped the American Governor and some dozen other whites.\r\nThe reason they did not scalp their Padre, was that their Padre was one\r\nof the leaders of the rebellion and himself planned the massacre. That\r\nis how things stand in New Mexico!"\r\n\r\n"Where is your candidate at present, Father?"\r\n\r\n"He is a parish priest, on the shores of Lake Ontario, in my diocese. I\r\nhave watched his work for nine years. He is but thirty-five now. He came\r\nto us directly from the Seminary."\r\n\r\n"And his name is?"\r\n\r\n"Jean Marie Latour."\r\n\r\nMaria de Allande, leaning back in his chair, put the tips of his long\r\nfingers together and regarded them thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Of course, Father Ferrand, the Propaganda will almost certainly appoint\r\nto this Vicarate the man whom the Council at Baltimore recommends."\r\n\r\n"Ah yes, your Eminence; but a word from you to the Provincial Council,\r\nan inquiry, a suggestion----"\r\n\r\n"Would have some weight, I admit," replied the Cardinal smiling. "And\r\nthis Latour is intelligent, you say? What a fate you are drawing upon\r\nhim! But I suppose it is no worse than a life among the Hurons. My\r\nknowledge of your country is chiefly drawn from the romances of Fenimore\r\nCooper, which I read in English with great pleasure. But has your priest\r\na versatile intelligence? Any intelligence in matters of art, for\r\nexample?"\r\n\r\n"And what need would he have for that, Monsignor? Besides, he is from\r\nAuvergne."\r\n\r\nThe three Cardinals broke into laughter and refilled their glasses. They\r\nwere all becoming restive under the monotonous persistence of the\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\n"Listen," said the host, "and I will relate a little story, while the\r\nBishop does me the compliment to drink my champagne. I have a reason for\r\nasking this question which you have answered so finally. In my family\r\nhouse in Valencia I have a number of pictures by the great Spanish\r\npainters, collected chiefly by my great-grandfather, who was a man of\r\nperception in these things and, for his time, rich. His collection of El\r\nGreco is, I believe, quite the best in Spain. When my progenitor was an\r\nold man, along came one of these missionary priests from New Spain,\r\nbegging. All missionaries from the Americas were inveterate beggars,\r\nthen as now, Bishop Ferrand. This Franciscan had considerable success,\r\nwith his tales of pious Indian converts and struggling missions. He came\r\nto visit at my great-grandfather\'s house and conducted devotions in the\r\nabsence of the Chaplain. He wheedled a good sum of money out of the old\r\nman, as well as vestments and linen and chalices--he would take\r\nanything--and he implored my grandfather to give him a painting from his\r\ngreat collection, for the ornamentation of his mission church among the\r\nIndians. My grandfather told him to choose from the gallery, believing\r\nthe priest would covet most what he himself could best afford to spare.\r\nBut not at all; the hairy Franciscan pounced upon one of the best in the\r\ncollection; a young St. Francis in meditation, by El Greco, and the\r\nmodel for the saint was one of the very handsome Dukes of Albuquerque.\r\nMy grandfather protested; tried to persuade the fellow that some picture\r\nof the Crucifixion, or a martyrdom, would appeal more strongly to his\r\nredskins. What would a St. Francis, of almost feminine beauty, mean to\r\nthe scalp-takers?\r\n\r\n"All in vain. The missionary turned upon his host with a reply which has\r\nbecome a saying in our family: \'You refuse me this picture because it is\r\na good picture. _It is too good for God, but it is not too good for\r\nyou_.\'\r\n\r\n"He carried off the painting. In my grandfather\'s manuscript catalogue,\r\nunder the number and title of the St. Francis, is written: _Given to\r\nFray Teodocio, for the glory of God, to enrich his mission church at\r\nPueblo de Cia, among the savages of New Spain_.\r\n\r\n"It is because of this lost treasure, Father Ferrand, that I happen to\r\nhave had some personal correspondence with the Bishop of Durango. I once\r\nwrote the facts to him fully. He replied to me that the mission at Cia\r\nwas long ago destroyed and its furnishings scattered. Of course the\r\npainting may have been ruined in a pillage or massacre. On the other\r\nhand, it may still be hidden away in some crumbling sacristy or smoky\r\nwigwam. If your French priest had a discerning eye, now, and were sent\r\nto this Vicarate, he might keep my El Greco in mind."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop shook his head. "No, I can\'t promise you--I do not know. I\r\nhave noticed that he is a man of severe and refined tastes, but he is\r\nvery reserved. Down there the Indians do not dwell in wigwams, your\r\nEminence," he added gently.\r\n\r\n"No matter, Father. I see your redskins through Fenimore Cooper, and I\r\nlike them so. Now let us go to the terrace for our coffee and watch the\r\nevening come on."\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal led his guests up the narrow stairway. The long gravelled\r\nterrace and its balustrade were blue as a lake in the dusky air. Both\r\nsun and shadows were gone. The folds of russet country were now violet.\r\nWaves of rose and gold throbbed up the sky from behind the dome of the\r\nBasilica.\r\n\r\nAs the churchmen walked up and down the promenade, watching the stars\r\ncome out, their talk touched upon many matters, but they avoided\r\npolitics, as men are apt to do in dangerous times. Not a word was spoken\r\nof the Lombard war, in which the Pope\'s position was so anomalous. They\r\ntalked instead of a new opera by young Verdi, which was being sung in\r\nVenice; of the case of a Spanish dancing-girl who had lately become a\r\nreligious and was said to be working miracles in Andalusia. In this\r\nconversation the missionary took no part, nor could he even follow it\r\nwith much interest. He asked himself whether he had been on the frontier\r\nso long that he had quite lost his taste for the talk of clever men. But\r\nbefore they separated for the night Maria de Allande spoke a word in his\r\near, in English.\r\n\r\n"You are distrait, Father Ferrand. Are you wishing to unmake your new\r\nBishop already? It is too late. Jean Marie Latour--am I right?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK ONE\r\n\r\n_THE VICAR APOSTOLIC_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE CRUCIFORM TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nONE afternoon in the autumn of 1851 a solitary horseman, followed by a\r\npack-mule, was pushing through an arid stretch of country somewhere in\r\ncentral New Mexico. He had lost his way, and was trying to get back to\r\nthe trail, with only his compass and his sense of direction for guides.\r\nThe difficulty was that the country in which he found himself was so\r\nfeatureless--or rather, that it was crowded with features, all exactly\r\nalike. As far as he could see, on every side, the landscape was heaped\r\nup into monotonous red sand-hills, not much larger than haycocks, and\r\nvery much the shape of haycocks. One could not have believed that in the\r\nnumber of square miles a man is able to sweep with the eye there could\r\nbe so many uniform red hills. He had been riding among them since early\r\nmorning, and the look of the country had no more changed than if he had\r\nstood still. He must have travelled through thirty miles of these\r\nconical red hills, winding his way in the narrow cracks between them,\r\nand he had begun to think that he would never see anything else. They\r\nwere so exactly like one another that he seemed to be wandering in some\r\ngeometrical nightmare; flattened cones, they were, more the shape of\r\nMexican ovens than haycocks--yes, exactly the shape of Mexican ovens,\r\nred as brick-dust, and naked of vegetation except for small juniper\r\ntrees. And the junipers, too, were the shape of Mexican ovens. Every\r\nconical hill was spotted with smaller cones of juniper, a uniform\r\nyellowish green, as the hills were a uniform red. The hills thrust out\r\nof the ground so thickly that they seemed to be pushing each other,\r\nelbowing each other aside, tipping each other over.\r\n\r\nThe blunted pyramid, repeated so many hundred times upon his retina and\r\ncrowding down upon him in the heat, had confused the traveller, who was\r\nsensitive to the shape of things.\r\n\r\n"_Mais, c\'est fantastique_!" he muttered, closing his eyes to rest them\r\nfrom the intrusive omnipresence of the triangle.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes again, his glance immediately fell upon one\r\njuniper which differed in shape from the others. It was not a\r\nthick-growing cone, but a naked, twisted trunk, perhaps ten feet high,\r\nand at the top it parted into two lateral, flat-lying branches, with a\r\nlittle crest of green in the centre, just above the cleavage. Living\r\nvegetation could not present more faithfully the form of the Cross.\r\n\r\nThe traveller dismounted, drew from his pocket a much worn book, and\r\nbaring his head, knelt at the foot of the cruciform tree.\r\n\r\nUnder his buckskin riding-coat he wore a black vest and the cravat and\r\ncollar of a churchman. A young priest, at his devotions; and a priest in\r\na thousand, one knew at a glance. His bowed head was not that of an\r\nordinary man,--it was built for the seat of a fine intelligence. His\r\nbrow was open, generous, reflective, his features handsome and somewhat\r\nsevere. There was a singular elegance about the hands below the fringed\r\ncuffs of the buckskin jacket. Everything showed him to be a man of\r\ngentle birth--brave, sensitive, courteous. His manners, even when he was\r\nalone in the desert, were distinguished. He had a kind of courtesy\r\ntoward himself, toward his beasts, toward the juniper tree before which\r\nhe knelt, and the God whom he was addressing.\r\n\r\nHis devotions lasted perhaps half an hour, and when he rose he looked\r\nrefreshed. He began talking to his mare in halting Spanish, asking\r\nwhether she agreed with him that it would be better to push on, weary as\r\nshe was, in hope of finding the trail. He had no water left in his\r\ncanteen, and the horses had had none since yesterday morning. They had\r\nmade a dry camp in these hills last night. The animals were almost at\r\nthe end of their endurance, but they would not recuperate until they got\r\nwater, and it seemed best to spend their last strength in searching for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn a long caravan trip across Texas this man had had some experience of\r\nthirst, as the party with which he travelled was several times put on a\r\nmeagre water ration for days together. But he had not suffered then as\r\nhe did now. Since morning he had had a feeling of illness; the taste of\r\nfever in his mouth, and alarming seizures of vertigo. As these conical\r\nhills pressed closer and closer upon him, he began to wonder whether his\r\nlong wayfaring from the mountains of Auvergne were possibly to end here.\r\nHe reminded himself of that cry, wrung from his Saviour on the Cross,\r\n"_J\'ai soif_!" Of all our Lord\'s physical sufferings, only one, "I\r\nthirst," rose to His lips. Empowered by long training, the young priest\r\nblotted himself out of his own consciousness and meditated upon the\r\nanguish of his Lord. The Passion of Jesus became for him the only\r\nreality; the need of his own body was but a part of that conception.\r\n\r\nHis mare stumbled, breaking his mood of contemplation. He was sorrier\r\nfor his beasts than for himself. He, supposed to be the intelligence of\r\nthe party, had got the poor animals into this interminable desert of\r\novens. He was afraid he had been absent-minded, had been pondering his\r\nproblem instead of heeding the way. His problem was how to recover a\r\nBishopric. He was a Vicar Apostolic, lacking a Vicarate. He was thrust\r\nout; his flock would have none of him.\r\n\r\nThe traveller was Jean Marie Latour, consecrated Vicar Apostolic of New\r\nMexico and Bishop of Agathonica _in partibus_ at Cincinnati a year\r\nago--and ever since then he had been trying to reach his Vicarate. No\r\none in Cincinnati could tell him how to get to New Mexico--no one had\r\never been there. Since young Father Latour\'s arrival in America, a\r\nrailroad had been built through from New York to Cincinnati; but there\r\nit ended. New Mexico lay in the middle of a dark continent. The Ohio\r\nmerchants knew of two routes only. One was the Santa F\xc3\xa9 trail from St.\r\nLouis, but at that time it was very dangerous because of Comanche Indian\r\nraids. His friends advised Father Latour to go down the river to New\r\nOrleans, thence by boat to Galveston, across Texas to San Antonio, and\r\nto wind up into New Mexico along the Rio Grande valley. This he had\r\ndone, but with what misadventures!\r\n\r\nHis steamer was wrecked and sunk in the Galveston harbour, and he had\r\nlost all his worldly possessions except his books, which he saved at the\r\nrisk of his life. He crossed Texas with a traders\' caravan, and\r\napproaching San Antonio he was hurt in jumping from an overturning\r\nwagon, and had to lie for three months in the crowded house of a poor\r\nIrish family, waiting for his injured leg to get strong.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a year after he had embarked upon the Mississippi that the\r\nyoung Bishop, at about the sunset hour of a summer afternoon, at last\r\nbeheld the old settlement toward which he had been journeying so long:\r\nThe wagon train had been going all day through a greasewood plain, when\r\nlate in the afternoon the teamsters began shouting that over yonder was\r\nthe Villa. Across the level, Father Latour could distinguish low brown\r\nshapes, like earthworks, lying at the base of wrinkled green mountains\r\nwith bare tops,--wave-like mountains, resembling billows beaten up from\r\na flat sea by a heavy gale; and their green was of two colors--aspen and\r\nevergreen, not intermingled but lying in solid areas of light and dark.\r\n\r\nAs the wagons went forward and the sun sank lower, a sweep of red\r\ncarnelian-coloured hills lying at the foot of the mountains came into\r\nview; they curved like two arms about a depression in the plain; and in\r\nthat depression, was Santa F\xc3\xa9, at last! A thin, wavering adobe town ...\r\na green plaza ... at one end a church with two earthen towers that rose\r\nhigh above the flatness. The long main street began at the church, the\r\ntown seemed to flow from it like a stream from a spring. The church\r\ntowers, and all the low adobe houses, were rose colour in that light,--a\r\nlittle darker in tone than the amphitheatre of red hills behind; and\r\nperiodically the plumes of poplars flashed like gracious accent\r\nmarks,--inclining and recovering themselves in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe young Bishop was not alone in the exaltation of that hour; beside\r\nhim rode Father Joseph Vaillant, his boyhood friend, who had made this\r\nlong pilgrimage with him and shared his dangers. The two rode into Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9 together, claiming it for the glory of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow, then, had Father Latour come to be here in the sand-hills, many\r\nmiles from his seat, unattended, far out of his way and with no\r\nknowledge of how to get back to it?\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Santa F\xc3\xa9, this was what had happened: The Mexican\r\npriests there had refused to recognize his authority. They disclaimed\r\nany knowledge of a Vicarate Apostolic, or a Bishop of Agathonica. They\r\nsaid they were under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Durango, and had\r\nreceived no instructions to the contrary. If Father Latour was to be\r\ntheir Bishop, where were his credentials? A parchment and letters, he\r\nknew, had been sent to the Bishop of Durango, but these had evidently\r\ngot no farther. There was no postal service in this part of the world;\r\nthe quickest and surest way to communicate with the Bishop of Durango\r\nwas to go to him. So, having travelled for nearly a year to reach Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9, Father Latour left it after a few weeks, and set off alone on\r\nhorseback to ride down into Old Mexico and back, a journey of full\r\nthree thousand miles.\r\n\r\nHe had been warned that there were many trails leading off the Rio\r\nGrande road, and that a stranger might easily mistake his way. For the\r\nfirst few days he had been cautious and watchful. Then he must have\r\ngrown careless and turned into some purely local trail. When he realized\r\nthat he was astray, his canteen was already empty and his horses seemed\r\ntoo exhausted to retrace their steps. He had persevered in this sandy\r\ntrack, which grew ever fainter, reasoning that it must lead somewhere.\r\n\r\nAll at once Father Latour thought he felt a change in the body of his\r\nmare. She lifted her head for the first time in a long while, and seemed\r\nto redistribute her weight upon her legs. The pack-mule behaved in a\r\nsimilar manner, and both quickened their pace. Was it possible they\r\nscented water?\r\n\r\nNearly an hour went by, and then, winding between two hills that were\r\nlike all the hundreds they had passed, the two beasts whinnied\r\nsimultaneously. Below them, in the midst of that wavy ocean of sand, was\r\na green thread of verdure and a running stream. This ribbon in the\r\ndesert seemed no wider than a man could throw a stone,--and it was\r\ngreener than anything Latour had ever seen, even in his own greenest\r\ncorner of the Old World. But for the quivering of the hide on his mare\'s\r\nneck and shoulders, he might have thought this a vision, a delusion of\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nRunning water, clover fields, cottonwoods, acacias, little adobe houses\r\nwith brilliant gardens, a boy-driving a flock of white goats toward the\r\nstream,--that was what the young Bishop saw.\r\n\r\nA few moments later, when he was struggling with his horses, trying to\r\nkeep them from overdrinking, a young girl with a black shawl over her\r\nhead came running toward him. He thought he had never seen a kindlier\r\nface. Her greeting was that of a Christian.\r\n\r\n"_Ave Maria Purissima, Se\xc3\xb1or_. Whence do you come?"\r\n\r\n"Blessed child," he replied in Spanish, "I am a priest who has lost his\r\nway. I am famished for water."\r\n\r\n"A priest?" she cried, "that is not possible! Yet I look at you, and it\r\nis true. Such a thing has never happened to us before; it must be in\r\nanswer to my father\'s prayers. Run, Pedro, and tell father and\r\nSalvatore."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nHIDDEN WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nAN hour later, as darkness came over the sand-hills, the young Bishop\r\nwas seated at supper in the motherhouse of this Mexican\r\nsettlement--which, he learned, was appropriately called _Agua Secreta_,\r\nHidden Water. At the table with him were his host, an old man called\r\nBenito, the oldest son, and two grandsons. The old man was a widower,\r\nand his daughter, Josepha, the girl who had run to meet the Bishop at\r\nthe stream, was his housekeeper. Their supper was a pot of frijoles\r\ncooked with meat, bread and goat\'s milk, fresh cheese and ripe apples.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he entered this room with its thick whitewashed adobe\r\nwalls, Father Latour had felt a kind of peace about it. In its bareness\r\nand simplicity there was something comely, as there was about the\r\nserious girl who had placed their food before them and who now stood in\r\nthe shadows against the wall, her eager eyes fixed upon his face. He\r\nfound himself very much at home with the four dark-headed men who sat\r\nbeside him in the candlelight. Their manners were gentle, their voices\r\nlow and agreeable. When he said grace before meat, the men had knelt on\r\nthe floor beside the table. The grandfather declared that the Blessed\r\nVirgin must have led the Bishop from his path and brought him here to\r\nbaptize the children and to sanctify the marriages. Their settlement was\r\nlittle known, he said. They had no papers for their land and were afraid\r\nthe Americans might take it away from them. There was no one in their\r\nsettlement who could read or write. Salvatore, his oldest son, had gone\r\nall the way to Albuquerque to find a wife, and had married there. But\r\nthe priest had charged him twenty pesos, and that was half of all he had\r\nsaved to buy furniture and glass windows for his house. His brothers and\r\ncousins, discouraged by his experience, had taken wives without the\r\nmarriage sacrament.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the Bishop\'s questions, they told him the simple story of\r\ntheir lives. They had here all they needed to make them happy. They spun\r\nand wove from the fleece of their flocks, raised their own corn and\r\nwheat and tobacco, dried their plums and apricots for winter. Once a\r\nyear the boys took the grain up to Albuquerque to have it ground, and\r\nbought such luxuries as sugar and coffee. They had bees, and when sugar\r\nwas high they sweetened with honey. Benito did not know in what year his\r\ngrandfather had settled here, coming from Chihuahua with all his goods\r\nin ox-carts. "But it was soon after the time when the French killed\r\ntheir king. My grandfather had heard talk of that before he left home,\r\nand used to tell us boys about it when he was an old man."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you have guessed that I am a Frenchman," said Father Latour.\r\n\r\nNo, they had not, but they felt sure he was not an American. Jos\xc3\xa9, the\r\nelder grandson, had been watching the visitor uncertainly. He was a\r\nhandsome boy, with a triangle of black hair hanging over his rather\r\nsullen eyes. He now spoke for the first time.\r\n\r\n"They say at Albuquerque that now we are all Americans, but that is not\r\ntrue, Padre. I will never be an American. They are infidels."\r\n\r\n"Not all, my son. I have lived among Americans in the north for ten\r\nyears, and I found many devout Catholics."\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his head. "They destroyed our churches when they\r\nwere fighting us, and stabled their horses in them. And now they will\r\ntake our religion away from us. We want our own ways and our own\r\nreligion."\r\n\r\nFather Latour began to tell them about his friendly relations with\r\nProtestants in Ohio, but they had not room in their minds for two ideas;\r\nthere was one Church, and the rest of the world was infidel. One thing\r\nthey could understand; that he had here in his saddle-bags his\r\nvestments, the altar stone, and all the equipment for celebrating the\r\nMass; and that to-morrow morning, after Mass, he would hear confessions,\r\nbaptize, and sanctify marriages.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Father Latour took up a candle and began to examine the\r\nholy images on the shelf over the fire-place. The wooden figures of the\r\nsaints, found in even the poorest Mexican houses, always interested him.\r\nHe had never yet seen two alike. These over Benito\'s fire-place had come\r\nin the oxcarts from Chihuahua nearly sixty years ago. They had been\r\ncarved by some devout soul, and brightly painted, though the colours had\r\nsoftened with time, and they were dressed in cloth, like dolls. They\r\nwere much more to his taste than the factory-made plaster images in his\r\nmission churches in Ohio--more like the homely stone carvings on the\r\nfront of old parish churches in Auvergne. The wooden Virgin was a\r\nsorrowing mother indeed,--long and stiff and severe, very long from the\r\nneck to the waist, even longer from waist to feet, like some of the\r\nrigid mosaics of the Eastern Church. She was dressed in black, with a\r\nwhite apron, and a black reboso over her head, like a Mexican woman of\r\nthe poor. At her right was St. Joseph, and at her left a fierce little\r\nequestrian figure, a saint wearing the costume of a Mexican _ranchero_,\r\nvelvet trousers richly embroidered and wide at the ankle, velvet jacket\r\nand silk shirt, and a high-crowned, broad-brimmed Mexican sombrero. He\r\nwas attached to his fat horse by a wooden pivot driven through the\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\nThe younger grandson saw the priest\'s interest in this figure. "That,"\r\nhe said, "is my name saint, Santiago."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; Santiago. He was a missionary, like me. In our country we call\r\nhim St. Jacques, and he carries a staff and a wallet--but here he would\r\nneed a horse, surely."\r\n\r\nThe boy looked at him in surprise. "But he is the saint of horses. Isn\'t\r\nhe that in your country?"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop shook his head. "No. I know nothing about that. How is he the\r\nsaint of horses?"\r\n\r\n"He blesses the mares and makes them fruitful. Even the Indians believe\r\nthat. They know that if they neglect to pray to Santiago for a few\r\nyears, the foals do not come right."\r\n\r\nA little later, after his devotions, the young Bishop lay down in\r\nBenito\'s deep feather-bed, thinking how different was this night from\r\nhis anticipation of it. He had expected to make a dry camp in the\r\nwilderness, and to sleep under a juniper tree, like the Prophet,\r\ntormented by thirst. But here he lay in comfort and safety, with love\r\nfor his fellow creatures flowing like peace about his heart. If Father\r\nVaillant were here, he would say, "A miracle"; that the Holy Mother, to\r\nwhom he had addressed himself before the cruciform tree, had led him\r\nhither. And it was a miracle, Father Latour knew that. But his dear\r\nJoseph must always have the miracle very direct and spectacular, not\r\nwith Nature, but against it. He would almost be able to tell the colour\r\nof the mantle Our Lady wore when She took the mare by the bridle back\r\nyonder among the junipers and led her out of the pathless sand-hills, as\r\nthe angel led the ass on the Flight into Egypt.\r\n\r\n          *         *          *\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon of the following day the Bishop was walking alone\r\nalong the banks of the life-giving stream, reviewing in his mind the\r\nevents of the morning. Benito and his daughter had made an altar before\r\nthe sorrowful wooden Virgin, and placed upon it candles and flowers.\r\nEvery soul in the village, except Salvatore\'s sick wife, had come to the\r\nMass. He had performed marriages and baptisms and heard confessions and\r\nconfirmed until noon. Then came the christening feast. Jos\xc3\xa9 had killed\r\na kid the night before, and immediately after her confirmation Josepha\r\nslipped away to help her sisters-in-law roast it. When Father Latour\r\nasked her to give him his portion without chili, the girl inquired\r\nwhether it was more pious to eat it like that. He hastened to explain\r\nthat Frenchmen, as a rule, do not like high seasoning, lest she should\r\nhereafter deprive herself of her favourite condiment.\r\n\r\nAfter the feast the sleepy children were taken home, the men gathered in\r\nthe plaza to smoke under the great cottonwood trees. The Bishop, feeling\r\na need of solitude, had gone forth to walk, firmly refusing an escort.\r\nOn his way he passed the earthen thrashing-floor, where these people\r\nbeat out their grain and winnowed it in the wind, like the Children of\r\nIsrael. He heard a frantic bleating behind him, and was overtaken by\r\nPedro with the great flock of goats, indignant at their day\'s\r\nconfinement, and wild to be in the fringe of pasture along the hills.\r\nThey leaped the stream like arrows speeding from the bow, and regarded\r\nthe Bishop as they passed him with their mocking, humanly intelligent\r\nsmile. The young bucks were light and elegant in figure, with their\r\npointed chins and polished tilted horns. There was great variety in\r\ntheir faces, but in nearly all something supercilious and sardonic. The\r\nangoras had long silky hair of a dazzling whiteness. As they leaped\r\nthrough the sunlight they brought to mind the chapter in the Apocalypse,\r\nabout the whiteness of them that were washed in the blood of the Lamb.\r\nThe young Bishop smiled at his mixed theology. But though the goat had\r\nalways been the symbol of pagan lewdness, he told himself that their\r\nfleece had warmed many a good Christian, and their rich milk nourished\r\nsickly children.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile above the village he came upon the water-head, a spring\r\noverhung by the sharp-leafed variety of cottonwood called water willow.\r\nAll about it crowded the oven-shaped hills,--nothing to hint of water\r\nuntil it rose miraculously out of the parched and thirsty sea of sand.\r\nSome subterranean stream found an outlet here, was released from\r\ndarkness. The result was grass and trees and flowers and human life;\r\nhousehold order and hearths from which the smoke of burning pi\xc3\xb1on logs\r\nrose like incense to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop sat a long time by the spring, while the declining sun poured\r\nits beautifying light over those low, rose-tinted houses and bright\r\ngardens. The old grandfather had shown him arrow-heads and corroded\r\nmedals, and a sword hilt, evidently Spanish, that he had found in the\r\nearth near the water-head. This spot had been a refuge for humanity long\r\nbefore these Mexicans had come upon it. It was older than history, like\r\nthose well-heads in his own country where the Roman settlers had set up\r\nthe image of a river goddess, and later the Christian priests had\r\nplanted a cross. This settlement was his Bishopric in miniature;\r\nhundreds of square miles of thirsty desert, then a spring, a village,\r\nold men trying to remember their catechism to teach their grandchildren.\r\nThe Faith planted by the Spanish friars and watered with their blood was\r\nnot dead; it awaited only the toil of the husbandman. He was not\r\ntroubled about the revolt in Santa F\xc3\xa9, or the powerful old native\r\npriest who led it--Father Martinez, of Taos, who had ridden over from\r\nhis parish expressly to receive the new Vicar and to drive him away. He\r\nwas rather terrifying, that old priest, with his big head, violent\r\nSpanish face, and shoulders like a buffalo; but the day of his tyranny\r\nwas almost over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTHE BISHOP _CHEZ LUI_\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was the late afternoon of Christmas Day, and the Bishop sat at his\r\ndesk writing letters. Since his return to Santa F\xc3\xa9 his official\r\ncorrespondence had been heavy; but the closely-written sheets over which\r\nhe bent with a thoughtful smile were not to go to Monsignori, or to\r\nArchbishops, or to the heads of religious houses,--but to France, to\r\nAuvergne, to his own little town; to a certain grey, winding street,\r\npaved with cobbles and shaded by tall chestnuts on which, even to-day,\r\nsome few brown leaves would be clinging, or dropping one by one, to be\r\ncaught in the cold green ivy on the walls.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had returned from his long horseback trip into Mexico only\r\nnine days ago. At Durango the old Mexican prelate there had, after some\r\ndelay, delivered to him the documents that defined his Vicarate, and\r\nFather Latour rode back the fifteen hundred miles to Santa F\xc3\xa9 through\r\nthe sunny days of early winter. On his arrival he found amity instead of\r\nenmity awaiting him. Father Vaillant had already endeared himself to the\r\npeople. The Mexican priest who was in charge of the pro-cathedral had\r\ngracefully retired--gone to visit his family in Old Mexico, and carried\r\nhis effects along with him. Father Vaillant had taken possession of the\r\npriest\'s house, and with the help of carpenters and the Mexican women of\r\nthe parish had put it in order. The Yankee traders and the military\r\nCommandant at Fort Marcy had sent generous contributions of bedding and\r\nblankets and odd pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nThe Episcopal residence was an old adobe house, much out of repair, but\r\nwith possibilities of comfort. Father Latour had chosen for his study a\r\nroom at one end of the wing. There he sat, as this afternoon of\r\nChristmas Day faded into evening. It was a long room of an agreeable\r\nshape. The thick clay walls had been finished on the inside by the deft\r\npalms of Indian women, and had that irregular and intimate quality of\r\nthings made entirely by the human hand. There was a reassuring solidity\r\nand depth about those walls, rounded at door-sills and window-sills,\r\nrounded in wide wings about the corner fire-place. The interior had been\r\nnewly whitewashed in the Bishop\'s absence, and the flicker of the fire\r\nthrew a rosy glow over the wavy surfaces, never quite evenly flat, never\r\na dead white, for the ruddy colour of the clay underneath gave a warm\r\ntone to the lime wash. The ceiling was made of heavy cedar beams,\r\noverlaid by aspen saplings, all of one size, lying close together like\r\nthe ribs in corduroy and clad in their ruddy inner skins. The earth\r\nfloor was covered with thick Indian blankets; two blankets, very old,\r\nand beautiful in design and colour, were hung on the walls like\r\ntapestries.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the fire-place plastered recesses were let into the\r\nwall. In one, narrow and arched, stood the Bishop\'s crucifix. The other\r\nwas square, with a carved wooden door, like a grill, and within it lay a\r\nfew rare and beautiful books. The rest of the Bishop\'s library was on\r\nopen shelves at one end of the room.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of the house Father Vaillant had bought from the departed\r\nMexican priest. It was heavy and somewhat clumsy, but not unsightly. All\r\nthe wood used in making tables and bedsteads was hewn from tree boles\r\nwith the ax or hatchet. Even the thick planks on which the Bishop\'s\r\ntheological books rested were ax-dressed. There was not at that time a\r\nturning-lathe or a saw-mill in all northern New Mexico. The native\r\ncarpenters whittled out chair rungs and table legs, and fitted them\r\ntogether with wooden pins instead of iron nails. Wooden chests were used\r\nin place of dressers with drawers, and sometimes these were beautifully\r\ncarved, or covered with decorated leather. The desk at which the Bishop\r\nsat writing was an importation, a walnut "secretary" of American make\r\n(sent down by one of the officers of the Fort at Father Vaillant\'s\r\nsuggestion). His silver candlesticks he had brought from France long\r\nago. They were given to him by a beloved aunt when he was ordained.\r\n\r\nThe young Bishop\'s pen flew over the paper, leaving a trail of fine,\r\nfinished French script behind, in violet ink.\r\n\r\n"My new study, dear brother, as I write, is full of the delicious\r\nfragrance of the pi\xc3\xb1on logs burning in my fire-place. (We use this kind\r\nof cedar-wood altogether for fuel, and it is highly aromatic, yet\r\ndelicate. At our meanest tasks we have a perpetual odour of incense\r\nabout us.) I wish that you, and my dear sister, could look in upon this\r\nscene of comfort and peace. We missionaries wear a frock-coat and\r\nwide-brimmed hat all day, you know, and look like American traders. What\r\na pleasure to come home at night and put on my old cassock! I feel more\r\nlike a priest then--for so much of the day I must be a \'business\r\nman\'!--and, for some reason, more like a Frenchman. All day I am an\r\nAmerican in speech and thought--yes, in heart, too. The kindness of the\r\nAmerican traders, and especially of the military officers at the Fort,\r\ncommands more than a superficial loyalty. I mean to help the officers at\r\ntheir task here. I can assist them more than they realize. The Church\r\ncan do more than the Fort to make these poor Mexicans \'good Americans.\'\r\nAnd it is for the people\'s good; there is no other way in which they can\r\nbetter their condition.\r\n\r\n"But this is not the day to write you of my duties or my purposes.\r\nTo-night we are exiles, happy ones, thinking of home. Father Joseph has\r\nsent away our Mexican woman,--he will make a good cook of her in time,\r\nbut to-night he is preparing our Christmas dinner himself. I had thought\r\nhe would be worn out to-day, for he has been conducting a Novena of High\r\nMasses, as is the custom here before Christmas. After the Novena, and\r\nthe midnight Mass last night, I supposed he would be willing to rest\r\nto-day; but not a bit of it. You know his motto, \'Rest in action.\' I\r\nbrought him a bottle of olive-oil on my horse all the way from Durango\r\n(I say \'olive-oil,\' because here \'oil\' means something to grease the\r\nwheels of wagons!), and he is making some sort of cooked salad. We have\r\nno green vegetables here in winter, and no one seems ever to have heard\r\nof that blessed plant, the lettuce. Joseph finds it hard to do without\r\nsalad-oil, he always had it in Ohio, though it was a great extravagance.\r\nHe has been in the kitchen all afternoon. There is only an open\r\nfire-place for cooking, and an earthen roasting-oven out in the\r\ncourtyard. But he has never failed me in anything yet; and I think I can\r\npromise you that to-night two Frenchmen will sit down to a good dinner\r\nand drink your health."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop laid down his pen and lit his two candles with a splinter\r\nfrom the fire, then stood dusting his fingers by the deep-set window,\r\nlooking out at the pale blue darkening sky. The evening-star hung above\r\nthe amber afterglow, so soft, so brilliant that she seemed to bathe in\r\nher own silver light. _Ave Maris Stella_, the song which one of his\r\nfriends at the Seminary used to intone so beautifully; humming it softly\r\nhe returned to his desk and was just dipping his pen in the ink when the\r\ndoor opened, and a voice said,\r\n\r\n"_Monseigneur est servi! Alors, Jean, veux-tu apporter les bougies._"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop carried the candles into the dining-room, where the table was\r\nlaid and Father Vaillant was changing his cook\'s apron for his cassock.\r\nCrimson from standing over an open fire, his rugged face was even\r\nhomelier than usual--though one of the first things a stranger decided\r\nupon meeting Father Joseph was that the Lord had made few uglier men. He\r\nwas short, skinny, bow-legged from a life on horseback, and his\r\ncountenance had little to recommend it but kindliness and vivacity. He\r\nlooked old, though he was then about forty. His skin was hardened and\r\nseamed by exposure to weather in a bitter climate, his neck scrawny and\r\nwrinkled like an old man\'s. A bold, blunt-tipped nose, positive chin, a\r\nvery large mouth,--the lips thick and succulent but never loose, never\r\nrelaxed, always stiffened by effort or working with excitement. His\r\nhair, sunburned to the shade of dry hay, had originally been\r\ntow-coloured; "_Blanchet_" ("Whitey") he was always called at the\r\nSeminary. Even his eyes were near-sighted, and of such a pale, watery\r\nblue as to be unimpressive. There was certainly nothing in his outer\r\ncase to suggest the fierceness and fortitude and fire of the man, and\r\nyet even the thick-blooded Mexican half-breeds knew his quality at once.\r\nIf the Bishop returned to find Santa F\xc3\xa9 friendly to him, it was because\r\neverybody believed in Father Vaillant--homely, real, persistent, with\r\nthe driving power of a dozen men in his poorly built body.\r\n\r\nOn coming into the dining-room, Bishop Latour placed his candlesticks\r\nover the fire-place, since there were already six upon the table,\r\nilluminating the brown soup-pot. After they had stood for a moment in\r\nprayer, Father Joseph lifted the cover and ladled the soup into the\r\nplates, a dark onion soup with croutons. The Bishop tasted it critically\r\nand smiled at his companion. After the spoon had travelled to his lips a\r\nfew times, he put it down and leaning back in his chair remarked,\r\n\r\n"Think of it, _Blanchet_; in all this vast country between the\r\nMississippi and the Pacific Ocean, there is probably not another human\r\nbeing who could make a soup like this."\r\n\r\n"Not unless he is a Frenchman," said Father Joseph. He had tucked a\r\nnapkin over the front of his cassock and was losing no time in\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n"I am not deprecating your individual talent, Joseph," the Bishop\r\ncontinued, "but, when one thinks of it, a soup like this is not the work\r\nof one man. It is the result of a constantly refined tradition. There\r\nare nearly a thousand years of history in this soup."\r\n\r\nFather Joseph frowned intently at the earthen pot in the middle of the\r\ntable. His pale, near-sighted eyes had always the look of peering into\r\ndistance. "_C\'est \xc3\xa7a, c\'est vrai_," he murmured. "But how," he\r\nexclaimed as he filled the Bishop\'s plate again, "how can a man make a\r\nproper soup without leeks, that king of vegetables? We cannot go on\r\neating onions for ever."\r\n\r\nAfter carrying away the _soupi\xc3\xa8re_, he brought in the roast chicken and\r\n_pommes saut\xc3\xa9es_. "And salad, Jean," he continued as he began to carve.\r\n"Are we to eat dried beans and roots for the rest of our lives? Surely\r\nwe must find time to make a garden. Ah, my garden at Sandusky! And you\r\ncould snatch me away from it! You will admit that you never ate better\r\nlettuces in France. And my vineyard; a natural habitat for the vine,\r\nthat. I tell you, the shores of Lake Erie will be covered with vineyards\r\none day. I envy the man who is drinking my wine. Ah well, that is a\r\nmissionary\'s life; to plant where another shall reap."\r\n\r\nAs this was Christmas Day, the two friends were speaking in their native\r\ntongue. For years they had made it a practice to speak English together,\r\nexcept upon very special occasions, and of late they conversed in\r\nSpanish, in which they both needed to gain fluency.\r\n\r\n"And yet sometimes you used to chafe a little at your dear Sandusky and\r\nits comforts," the Bishop reminded him--"to say that you would end a\r\nhome-staying parish priest, after all."\r\n\r\n"Of course, one wants to eat one\'s cake and have it, as they say in\r\nOhio. But no farther, Jean. This is far enough. Do not drag me any\r\nfarther." Father Joseph began gently to coax the cork from a bottle of\r\nred wine with his fingers. "This I begged for your dinner at the\r\nhacienda where I went to baptize the baby on St. Thomas\'s Day. It is not\r\neasy to separate these rich Mexicans from their French wine. They know\r\nits worth." He poured a few drops and tried it. "A slight taste of the\r\ncork; they do not know how to keep it properly. However, it is quite\r\ngood enough for missionaries."\r\n\r\n"You ask me not to drag you any farther, Joseph. I wish," Bishop Latour\r\nleaned back in his chair and locked his hands together beneath his chin,\r\n"I wish I knew how far this is! Does anyone know the extent of this\r\ndiocese, or of this territory? The Commandant at the Fort seems as much\r\nin the dark as I. He says I can get some information from the scout, Kit\r\nCarson, who lives at Taos."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t begin worrying about the diocese, Jean. For the present, Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9 is the diocese. Establish order at home. To-morrow I will have a\r\nreckoning with the churchwardens, who allowed that band of drunken\r\ncowboys to come in to the midnight Mass and defile the font. There is\r\nenough to do here. _Festina lente_. I have made a resolve not to go more\r\nthan three days\' journey from Santa F\xc3\xa9 for one year."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop smiled and shook his head. "And when you were at the\r\nSeminary, you made a resolve to lead a life of contemplation."\r\n\r\nA light leaped into Father Joseph\'s homely face. "I have not yet\r\nrenounced that hope. One day you will release me, and I will return to\r\nsome religious house in France and end my days in devotion to the Holy\r\nMother. For the time being, it is my destiny to serve Her in action. But\r\nthis is far enough, Jean."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop again shook his head and murmured, "Who knows how far?"\r\n\r\nThe vary little priest whose life was to be a succession of mountain\r\nranges, pathless deserts, yawning canyons and swollen rivers, who was to\r\ncarry the Cross into territories yet unknown and unnamed, who would wear\r\ndown mules and horses and scouts and stage-drivers, to-night looked\r\napprehensively at his superior and repeated, "No more, Jean. This is far\r\nenough." Then making haste to change the subject, he said briskly, "A\r\nbean salad was the best I could do for you; but with onion, and just a\r\nsuspicion of salt pork, it is not so bad."\r\n\r\nOver the compote of dried plums they fell to talking of the great yellow\r\nones that grew in the old Latour garden at home. Their thoughts met in\r\nthat tilted cobble street, winding down a hill, with the uneven garden\r\nwalls and tall horse-chestnuts on either side; a lonely street after\r\nnightfall, with soft street lamps shaped like lanterns at the darkest\r\nturnings. At the end of it was the church where the Bishop made his\r\nfirst Communion, with a grove of flat-cut plane trees in front, under\r\nwhich the market was held on Tuesdays and Fridays.\r\n\r\nWhile they lingered over these memories--an indulgence they seldom\r\npermitted themselves--the two missionaries were startled by a volley of\r\nrifle-shots and blood-curdling yells without, and the galloping of\r\nhorses. The Bishop half rose, but Father Joseph reassured him with a\r\nshrug.\r\n\r\n"Do not discompose yourself. The same thing happened here on the eve of\r\nAll Souls\' Day. A band of drunken cowboys, like those who came into the\r\nchurch last night, go out to the pueblo and get the Tesuque Indian boys\r\ndrunk, and then they ride in to serenade the soldiers at the Fort in\r\nthis manner."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nA BELL AND A MIRACLE\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morning after the Bishop\'s return from Durango, after his first\r\nnight in his Episcopal residence, he had a pleasant awakening from\r\nsleep. He had ridden into the courtyard after nightfall, having changed\r\nhorses at a _rancho_ and pushed on nearly sixty miles in order to reach\r\nhome. Consequently he slept late the next morning--did not awaken until\r\nsix o\'clock, when he heard the Angelus ringing. He recovered\r\nconsciousness slowly, unwilling to let go of a pleasing delusion that he\r\nwas in Rome. Still half believing that he was lodged near St. John\r\nLateran, he yet heard every stroke of the Ave Maria bell, marvelling to\r\nhear it rung correctly (nine quick strokes in all, divided into threes,\r\nwith an interval between); and from a bell with beautiful tone. Full,\r\nclear, with something bland and suave, each note floated through the air\r\nlike a globe of silver. Before the nine strokes were done Rome faded,\r\nand behind it he sensed something Eastern, with palm trees,--Jerusalem,\r\nperhaps, though he had never been there. Keeping his eyes closed, he\r\ncherished for a moment this sudden, pervasive sense of the East. Once\r\nbefore he had been carried out of the body thus to a place far away. It\r\nhad happened in a street in New Orleans. He had turned a corner and come\r\nupon an old woman with a basket of yellow flowers; sprays of yellow\r\nsending out a honey-sweet perfume. Mimosa--but before he could think of\r\nthe name he was overcome by a feeling of place, was dropped, cassock and\r\nall, into a garden in the south of France where he had been sent one\r\nwinter in his childhood to recover from an illness. And now this silvery\r\nbell note had carried him farther and faster than sound could travel.\r\n\r\nWhen he joined Father Vaillant at coffee, that impetuous man who could\r\nnever keep a secret asked him anxiously whether he had heard anything.\r\n\r\n"I thought I heard the Angelus, Father Joseph, but my reason tells me\r\nthat only a long sea voyage could bring me within sound of such a bell."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Father Joseph briskly. "I found that remarkable bell\r\nhere, in the basement of old San Miguel. They tell me it has been here a\r\nhundred years or more. There is no church tower in the place strong\r\nenough to hold it--it is very thick and must weigh close upon eight\r\nhundred pounds. But I had a scaffolding built in the churchyard, and\r\nwith the help of oxen we raised it and got it swung on crossbeams. I\r\ntaught a Mexican boy to ring it properly against your return."\r\n\r\n"But how could it have come here? It is Spanish, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the inscription is in Spanish, to St. Joseph, and the date is\r\n1356. It must have been brought up from Mexico City in an ox-cart. A\r\nheroic undertaking, certainly. Nobody knows where it was cast. But they\r\ndo tell a story about it: that it was pledged to St. Joseph in the wars\r\nwith the Moors, and that the people of some besieged city brought all\r\ntheir plate and silver and gold ornaments and threw them in with the\r\nbaser metals. There is certainly a good deal of silver in the bell,\r\nnothing else would account for its tone."\r\n\r\nFather Latour reflected. "And the silver of the Spaniards was really\r\nMoorish, was it not? If not actually of Moorish make, copied from their\r\ndesign. The Spaniards knew nothing about working silver except as they\r\nlearned it from the Moors."\r\n\r\n"What are you doing, Jean? Trying to make my bell out an infidel?"\r\nFather Joseph asked impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop smiled. "I am trying to account for the fact that when I\r\nheard it this morning it struck me at once as something oriental. A\r\nlearned Scotch Jesuit in Montreal told me that our first bells, and the\r\nintroduction of the bell in the service all over Europe, originally came\r\nfrom the East. He said the Templars brought the Angelus back from the\r\nCrusades, and it is really an adaptation of a Moslem custom."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant sniffed. "I notice that scholars always manage to dig\r\nout something belittling," he complained.\r\n\r\n"Belittling? I should say the reverse. I am glad to think there is\r\nMoorish silver in your bell. When we first came here, the one good\r\nworkman we found in Santa F\xc3\xa9 was a silversmith. The Spaniards handed on\r\ntheir skill to the Mexicans, and the Mexicans have taught the Navajos to\r\nwork silver; but it all came from the Moors."\r\n\r\n"I am no scholar, as you know," said Father Vaillant rising. "And this\r\nmorning we have many practical affairs to occupy us. I have promised\r\nthat you will give an audience to a good old man, a native priest from\r\nthe Indian mission at Santa Clara, who is returning from Mexico. He has\r\njust been on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe and\r\nhas been much edified. He would like to tell you the story of his\r\nexperience. It seems that ever since he was ordained he has desired to\r\nvisit the shrine. During your absence I have found how particularly\r\nprecious is that shrine to all Catholics in New Mexico. They regard it\r\nas the one absolutely authenticated appearance of the Blessed Virgin in\r\nthe New World, and a witness of Her affection for Her Church on this\r\ncontinent."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop went into his study, and Father Vaillant brought in Padre\r\nEscolastico Herrera, a man of nearly seventy, who had been forty years\r\nin the ministry, and had just accomplished the pious desire of a\r\nlifetime. His mind was still full of the sweetness of his late\r\nexperience. He was so rapt that nothing else interested him. He asked\r\nanxiously whether perhaps the Bishop would have more leisure to attend\r\nto him later in the day. But Father Latour placed a chair for him and\r\ntold him to proceed.\r\n\r\nThe old man thanked him for the privilege of being seated. Leaning\r\nforward, with his hands locked between his knees, he told the whole\r\nstory of the miraculous appearance, both because it was so dear to his\r\nheart, and because he was sure that no "American" Bishop would have\r\nheard of the occurrence as it was, though at Rome all the details were\r\nwell known and two Popes had sent gifts to the shrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, December 9th, in the year 1531, a poor neophyte of the\r\nmonastery of St. James was hurrying down Tapeyac hill to attend Mass in\r\nthe City of Mexico. His name was Juan Diego and he was fifty-five years\r\nold. When he was half way down the hill a light shone in his path, and\r\nthe Mother of God appeared to him as a young woman of great beauty, clad\r\nin blue and gold. She greeted him by name and said:\r\n\r\n"Juan, seek out thy Bishop and bid him build a church in my honour on\r\nthe spot where I now stand. Go then, and I will bide here and await thy\r\nreturn."\r\n\r\nBrother Juan ran into the City and straight to the Bishop\'s palace,\r\nwhere he reported the matter. The Bishop was Zumarraga, a Spaniard. He\r\nquestioned the monk severely and told him he should have required a sign\r\nof the Lady to assure him that she was indeed the Mother of God and not\r\nsome evil spirit. He dismissed the poor brother harshly and set an\r\nattendant to watch his actions.\r\n\r\nJuan went forth very downcast and repaired to the house of his uncle,\r\nBernardino, who was sick of a fever. The two succeeding days he spent in\r\ncaring for this aged man who seemed at the point of death. Because of\r\nthe Bishop\'s reproof he had fallen into doubt, and did not return to the\r\nspot where the Lady said She would await him. On Tuesday he left the\r\nCity to go back to his monastery to fetch medicines for Bernardino, but\r\nhe avoided the place where he had seen the vision and went by another\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAgain he saw a light in his path and the Virgin appeared to him as\r\nbefore, saying, "Juan, why goest thou by this way?"\r\n\r\nWeeping, he told Her that the Bishop had distrusted his report, and that\r\nhe had been employed in caring for his uncle, who was sick unto death.\r\nThe Lady spoke to him with all comfort, telling him that his uncle would\r\nbe healed within the hour, and that he should return to Bishop Zumarraga\r\nand bid him build a church where She had first appeared to him. It must\r\nbe called the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, after Her dear shrine of\r\nthat name in Spain. When Brother Juan replied to Her that the Bishop\r\nrequired a sign, She said: "Go up on the rocks yonder, and gather\r\nroses."\r\n\r\nThough it was December and not the season for roses, he ran up among the\r\nrocks and found such roses as he had never seen before. He gathered them\r\nuntil he had filled his _tilma_. The _tilma_ was a mantle worn only by\r\nthe very poor,--a wretched garment loosely woven of coarse vegetable\r\nfibre and sewn down the middle. When he returned to the apparition, She\r\nbent over the flowers and took pains to arrange them, then closed the\r\nends of the _tilma_ together and said to him:\r\n\r\n"Go now, and do not open your mantle until you open it before your\r\nBishop."\r\n\r\nJuan sped into the City and gained admission to the Bishop, who was in\r\ncouncil with his Vicar.\r\n\r\n"Your Grace," he said, "the Blessed Lady who appeared to me has sent you\r\nthese roses for a sign."\r\n\r\nAt this he held up one end of his _tilma_ and let the roses fall in\r\nprofusion to the floor. To his astonishment, Bishop Zumarraga and his\r\nVicar instantly fell upon their knees among the flowers. On the inside\r\nof his poor mantle was a painting of the Blessed Virgin, in robes of\r\nblue and rose and gold, exactly as She had appeared to him upon the\r\nhill-side.\r\n\r\nA shrine was built to contain this miraculous portrait, which since that\r\nday has been the goal of countless pilgrimages and has performed many\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this picture Padre Escolastico had much to say: he affirmed that it\r\nwas of marvellous beauty, rich with gold, and the colours as pure and\r\ndelicate as the tints of early morning. Many painters had visited the\r\nshrine and marvelled that paint could be laid at all upon such poor and\r\ncoarse material. In the ordinary way of nature, the flimsy mantle would\r\nhave fallen to pieces long ago. The Padre modestly presented Bishop\r\nLatour and Father Joseph with little medals he had brought from the\r\nshrine; on one side a relief of the miraculous portrait, on the other an\r\ninscription: _Non fecit taliter omni nationi_. (_She hath not dealt so\r\nwith any nation_.)\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant was deeply stirred by the priest\'s recital, and after\r\nthe old man had gone he declared to the Bishop that he meant himself to\r\nmake a pilgrimage to this shrine at the earliest opportunity.\r\n\r\n"What a priceless thing for the poor converts of a savage country!" he\r\nexclaimed, wiping his glasses, which were clouded by his strong feeling.\r\n"All these poor Catholics who have been so long without instruction have\r\nat least the reassurance of that visitation. It is a household word with\r\nthem that their Blessed Mother revealed Herself in their own country, to\r\na poor convert. Doctrine is well enough for the wise, Jean; but the\r\nmiracle is something we can hold in our hands and love."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant began pacing restlessly up and down as he spoke, and the\r\nBishop watched him, musing. It was just this in his friend that was dear\r\nto him. "Where there is great love there are always miracles," he said\r\nat length. "One might almost say that an apparition is human vision\r\ncorrected by divine love. I do not see you as you really are, Joseph; I\r\nsee you through my affection for you. The Miracles of the Church seem to\r\nme to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming\r\nsuddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made\r\nfiner, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what\r\nis there about us always."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK TWO\r\n\r\n_MISSIONARY JOURNEYS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE MULES\r\n\r\n\r\nIN mid-March, Father Vaillant was on the road, returning from a\r\nmissionary journey to Albuquerque. He was to stop at the _rancho_ of a\r\nrich Mexican, Manuel Lujon, to marry his men and maid servants who were\r\nliving in concubinage, and to baptize the children. There he would spend\r\nthe night. To-morrow or the day after he would go on to Santa F\xc3\xa9,\r\nhalting by the way at the Indian pueblo of Santo Domingo to hold\r\nservice. There was a fine old mission church at Santo Domingo, but the\r\nIndians were of a haughty and suspicious disposition. He had said Mass\r\nthere on his way to Albuquerque, nearly a week ago. By dint of\r\ncanvassing from house to house, and offering medals and religious colour\r\nprints to all who came to church, he had got together a considerable\r\ncongregation. It was a large and prosperous pueblo, set among clean\r\nsand-hills, with its rich irrigated farm lands lying just below, in the\r\nvalley of the Rio Grande. His congregation was quiet, dignified,\r\nattentive. They sat on the earth floor, wrapped in their best blankets,\r\nrepose in every line of their strong, stubborn backs. He harangued them\r\nin such Spanish as he could command, and they listened with respect. But\r\nbring their children to be baptized, they would not. The Spaniards had\r\ntreated them very badly long ago, and they had been meditating upon\r\ntheir grievance for many generations. Father Vaillant had not baptized\r\none infant there, but he meant to stop to-morrow and try again. Then\r\nback to his Bishop, provided he could get his horse up La Bajada Hill.\r\n\r\nHe had bought his horse from a Yankee trader and had been woefully\r\ndeceived. One week\'s journey of from twenty to thirty miles a day had\r\nshown the beast up for a wind-broken wreck. Father Vaillant\'s mind was\r\nfull of material cares as he approached Manuel Lujon\'s place beyond\r\nBernalillo. The _rancho_ was like a little town, with all its stables,\r\ncorrals, and stake fences. The _casa grande_ was long and low, with\r\nglass windows and bright blue doors, a _portale_ running its full\r\nlength, supported by blue posts. Under this _portale_ the adobe wall was\r\nhung with bridles, saddles, great boots and spurs, guns and saddle\r\nblankets, strings of red peppers, fox skins, and the skins of two great\r\nrattlesnakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Father Vaillant rode in through the gateway, children came running\r\nfrom every direction, some with no clothing but a little shirt, and\r\nwomen with no shawls over their black hair came running after the\r\nchildren. They all disappeared when Manuel Lujon walked out of the great\r\nhouse, hat in hand, smiling and hospitable. He was a man of thirty-five,\r\nsettled in figure and somewhat full under the chin. He greeted the\r\npriest in the name of God and put out a hand to help him alight, but\r\nFather Vaillant sprang quickly to the ground.\r\n\r\n"God be with you, Manuel, and with your house. But where are those who\r\nare to be married?"\r\n\r\n"The men are all in the field, Padre. There is no hurry. A little wine,\r\na little bread, coffee, repose--and then the ceremonies."\r\n\r\n"A little wine, very willingly, and bread, too. But not until afterward.\r\nI meant to catch you all at dinner, but I am two hours late because my\r\nhorse is bad. Have someone bring in my saddle-bags, and I will put on my\r\nvestments. Send out to the fields for your men, Se\xc3\xb1or Lujon. A man can\r\nstop work to be married."\r\n\r\nThe swarthy host was dazed by this dispatch. "But one moment, Padre.\r\nThere are all the children to baptize; why not begin with them, if I\r\ncannot persuade you to wash the dust from your sainted brow and repose a\r\nlittle."\r\n\r\n"Take me to a place where I can wash and change my clothes, and I will\r\nbe ready before you can get them here. No, I tell you, Lujon, the\r\nmarriages first, the baptisms afterward; that order is but Christian. I\r\nwill baptize the children to-morrow morning, and their parents will at\r\nleast have been married over night."\r\n\r\nFather Joseph was conducted to his chamber, and the older boys were sent\r\nrunning off across the fields to fetch the men. Lujon and his two\r\ndaughters began constructing an altar at one end of the _sala_. Two old\r\nwomen came to scrub the floor, and another brought chairs and stools.\r\n\r\n"My God, but he is ugly, the Padre!" whispered one of these to the\r\nothers. "He must be very holy. And did you see the great wart he has on\r\nhis chin? My grandmother could take that away for him if she were alive,\r\npoor soul! Somebody ought to tell him about the holy mud at Chimayo.\r\nThat mud might dry it up. But there is nobody left now who can take\r\nwarts away."\r\n\r\n"No, the times are not so good any more," the other agreed. "And I doubt\r\nif all this marrying will make them any better. Of what use is it to\r\nmarry people after they have lived together and had children? and the\r\nman is maybe thinking about another woman, like Pablo. I saw him coming\r\nout of the brush with that oldest girl of Trinidad\'s, only Sunday\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nThe reappearance of the priest upon the scene cut short further scandal.\r\nHe knelt down before the improvised altar and began his private\r\ndevotions. The women tiptoed away. Se\xc3\xb1or Lujon himself went out toward\r\nthe servants\' quarters to hurry the candidates for the marriage\r\nsacrament. The women were giggling and snatching up their best shawls.\r\nSome of the men had even washed their hands. The household crowded into\r\nthe _sala_, and Father Vaillant married couples with great dispatch.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow morning, the baptisms," he announced. "And the mothers see to\r\nit that the children are clean, and that there are sponsors for all."\r\n\r\nAfter he had resumed his travelling-clothes, Father Joseph asked his\r\nhost at what hour he dined, remarking that he had been fasting since an\r\nearly breakfast.\r\n\r\n"We eat when it is ready--a little after sunset, usually. I have had a\r\nyoung lamb killed for your Reverence."\r\n\r\nFather Joseph kindled with interest. "Ah, and how will it be cooked?"\r\n\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Lujon shrugged. "Cooked? Why, they put it in a pot with chili,\r\nand some onions, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is the point. I have had too much stewed mutton. Will you\r\npermit me to go into the kitchen and cook my portion in my own way?"\r\n\r\nLujon waved his hand. "My house is yours, Padre. Into the kitchen I\r\nnever go--too many women. But there it is, and the woman in charge is\r\nnamed Rosa."\r\n\r\nWhen the Father entered the kitchen he found a crowd of women discussing\r\nthe marriages. They quickly dispersed, leaving old Rosa by her\r\nfire-place, where hung a kettle from which issued the savour of cooking\r\nmutton fat, all too familiar to Father Joseph. He found a half sheep\r\nhanging outside the door, covered with a bloody sack, and asked Rosa to\r\nheat the oven for him, announcing that he meant to roast the hind leg.\r\n\r\n"But Padre, I baked before the marriages. The oven is almost cold. It\r\nwill take an hour to heat it, and it is only two hours till supper."\r\n\r\n"Very well. I can cook my roast in an hour."\r\n\r\n"Cook a roast in an hour!" cried the old woman. "Mother of God, Padre,\r\nthe blood will not be dried in it!"\r\n\r\n"Not if I can help it!" said Father Joseph fiercely. "Now hurry with the\r\nfire, my good woman."\r\n\r\nWhen the Padre carved his roast at the supper-table, the serving-girls\r\nstood behind his chair and looked with horror at the delicate stream of\r\npink juice that followed the knife. Manuel Lujon took a slice for\r\npoliteness, but he did not eat it. Father Vaillant had his _gigot_ to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAll the men and boys sat down at the long table with the host, the women\r\nand children would eat later. Father Joseph and Lujon, at one end, had a\r\nbottle of white Bordeaux between them. It had been brought from Mexico\r\nCity on mule-back, Lujon said. They were discussing the road back to\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9, and when the missionary remarked that he would stop at Santo\r\nDomingo, the host asked him why he did not get a horse there. "I am\r\nafraid you will hardly get back to Santa F\xc3\xa9 on your own. The pueblo is\r\nfamous for breeding good horses. You might make a trade."\r\n\r\n"No," said Father Vaillant. "Those Indians are of a sullen disposition.\r\nIf I were to have dealings with them, they would suspect my motives. If\r\nwe are to save their souls, we must make it clear that we want no profit\r\nfor ourselves, as I told Father Gallegos in Albuquerque."\r\n\r\nManuel Lujon laughed and glanced down the table at his men, who were all\r\nshowing their white teeth. "You said that to the Padre at Albuquerque?\r\nYou have courage. He is a rich man, Padre Gallegos. All the same, I\r\nrespect him. I have played poker with him. He is a great gambler and\r\ntakes his losses like a man. He stops at nothing, plays like an\r\nAmerican."\r\n\r\n"And I," retorted Father Joseph, "I have not much respect for a priest\r\nwho either plays cards or manages to get rich."\r\n\r\n"Then you do not play?" asked Lujon. "I am disappointed. I had hoped we\r\ncould have a game after supper. The evenings are dull enough here. You\r\ndo not even play dominoes?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is another matter!" Father Joseph declared. "A game of\r\ndominoes, there by the fire, with coffee, or some of that excellent\r\ngrape brandy you allowed me to taste, that I would find refreshing. And\r\ntell me, Manuelito, where do you get that brandy? It is like a French\r\nliqueur."\r\n\r\n"It is well seasoned. It was made at Bernalillo in my grandfather\'s\r\ntime. They make it there still, but it is not so good now."\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after coffee, while the children were being got ready\r\nfor baptism, the host took Father Vaillant through his corrals and\r\nstables to show him his stock. He exhibited with peculiar pride two\r\ncream-coloured mules, stalled side by side. With his own hand he led\r\nthem out of the stable, in order to display to advantage their handsome\r\ncoats,--not bluish white, as with white horses, but a rich, deep ivory,\r\nthat in shadow changed to fawn-colour. Their tails were clipped at the\r\nend into the shape of bells.\r\n\r\n"Their names," said Lujon, "are Contento and Angelica, and they are as\r\ngood as their names. It seems that God has given them intelligence. When\r\nI talk to them, they look up at me like Christians; they are very\r\ncompanionable. They are always ridden together and have a great\r\naffection for each other."\r\n\r\nFather Joseph took one by the halter and led it about. "Ah, but they are\r\nrare creatures! I have never seen a mule or horse coloured like a young\r\nfawn before." To his host\'s astonishment, the wiry little priest sprang\r\nupon Contento\'s back with the agility of a grasshopper. The mule, too,\r\nwas astonished. He shook himself violently, bolted toward the gate of\r\nthe barnyard, and at the gate stopped suddenly. Since this did not throw\r\nhis rider, he seemed satisfied, trotted back, and stood placidly beside\r\nAngelica.\r\n\r\n"But you are a _caballero_, Father Vaillant!" Lujon exclaimed. "I doubt\r\nif Father Gallegos would have kept his seat--though he is something of a\r\nhunter."\r\n\r\n"The saddle is to be my home in your country, Lujon. What an easy gait\r\nthis mule has, and what a narrow back! I notice that especially. For a\r\nman with short legs, like me, it is a punishment to ride eight hours a\r\nday on a wide horse. And this I must do day after day. From here I go to\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9, and, after a day in conference with the Bishop, I start for\r\nMora."\r\n\r\n"For Mora?" exclaimed Lujon. "Yes, that is far, and the roads are very\r\nbad. On your mare you will never do it. She will drop dead under you."\r\nWhile he talked, the Father remained upon the mule\'s back, stroking him\r\nwith his hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, I have no other. God grant that she does not drop somewhere far\r\nfrom food and water. I can carry very little with me except my vestments\r\nand the sacred vessels."\r\n\r\nThe Mexican had been growing more and more thoughtful, as if he were\r\nconsidering something profound and not altogether cheerful. Suddenly his\r\nbrow cleared, and he turned to the priest with a radiant smile, quite\r\nboyish in its simplicity. "Father Vaillant," he burst out in a slightly\r\noratorical manner, "you have made my house right with Heaven, and you\r\ncharge me very little. I will do something very nice for you; I will\r\ngive you Contento for a present, and I hope to be particularly\r\nremembered in your prayers."\r\n\r\nSpringing to the ground, Father Vaillant threw his arms about his host.\r\n"Manuelito!" he cried, "for this darling mule I think I could almost\r\npray you into Heaven!"\r\n\r\nThe Mexican laughed, too, and warmly returned the embrace. Arm-in-arm\r\nthey went in to begin the baptisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Lujon went to call Father Vaillant for breakfast,\r\nhe found him in the barnyard, leading the two mules about and smoothing\r\ntheir fawn-coloured flanks, but his face was not the cheerful\r\ncountenance of yesterday.\r\n\r\n"Manuel," he said at once, "I cannot accept your present. I have thought\r\nupon it over night, and I see that I cannot. The Bishop works as hard as\r\nI do, and his horse is little better than mine. You know he lost\r\neverything on his way out here, in a shipwreck at Galveston,--among the\r\nrest a fine wagon he had had built for travel on these plains. I could\r\nnot go about on a mule like this when my Bishop rides a common hack. It\r\nwould be inappropriate. I must ride away on my old mare."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Padre?" Manuel looked troubled and somewhat aggrieved. Why should\r\nthe Padre spoil everything? It had all been very pleasant yesterday, and\r\nhe had felt like a prince of generosity. "I doubt if she will make La\r\nBajada Hill," he said slowly, shaking his head. "Look my horses over and\r\ntake the one that suits you. They are all better than yours."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Father Vaillant decidedly. "Having seen these mules, I\r\nwant nothing else. They are the colour of pearls, really! I will raise\r\nthe price of marriages until I can buy this pair from you. A missionary\r\nmust depend upon his mount for companionship in his lonely life. I want\r\na mule that can look at me like a Christian, as you said of these."\r\n\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Lujon sighed and looked about his barnyard as if he were trying\r\nto find some escape from this situation.\r\n\r\nFather Joseph turned to him with vehemence. "If I were a rich\r\n_ranchero_, like you, Manuel, I would do a splendid thing; I would\r\nfurnish the two mounts that are to carry the word of God about this\r\nheathen country, and then I would say to myself: _There go my Bishop and\r\nmy Vicario, on my beautiful cream-coloured mules_."\r\n\r\n"So be it, Padre," said Lujon with a mournful smile. "But I ought to get\r\na good many prayers. On my whole estate there is nothing I prize like\r\nthose two. True, they might pine if they were parted for long. They have\r\nnever been separated, and they have a great affection for each other.\r\nMules, as you know, have strong affections. It is hard for me to give\r\nthem up."\r\n\r\n"You will be all the happier for that, Manuelito," Father Joseph cried\r\nheartily. "Every time you think of these mules, you will feel pride in\r\nyour good deed."\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast Father Vaillant departed, riding Contento, with\r\nAngelica trotting submissively behind, and from his gate Se\xc3\xb1or Lujon\r\nwatched them disconsolately until they disappeared. He felt he had been\r\nworried out of his mules, and yet he bore no resentment. He did not\r\ndoubt Father Joseph\'s devotedness, nor his singleness of purpose. After\r\nall, a Bishop was a Bishop, and a Vicar was a Vicar, and it was not to\r\ntheir discredit that they worked like a pair of common parish priests.\r\nHe believed he would be proud of the fact that they rode Contento and\r\nAngelica. Father Vaillant had forced his hand, but he was rather glad of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE LONELY ROAD TO MORA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Bishop and his Vicar were riding through the rain in the Truchas\r\nmountains. The heavy, lead-coloured drops were driven slantingly through\r\nthe air by an icy wind from the peak. These raindrops, Father Latour\r\nkept thinking, were the shape of tadpoles, and they broke against his\r\nnose and cheeks, exploding with a splash, as if they were hollow and\r\nfull of air. The priests were riding across high mountain meadows, which\r\nin a few weeks would be green, though just now they were slate-coloured.\r\nOn every side lay ridges covered with blue-green fir trees; above them\r\nrose the horny backbones of mountains. The sky was very low; purplish\r\nlead-coloured clouds let down curtains of mist into the valleys between\r\nthe pine ridges. There was not a glimmer of white light in the dark\r\nvapours working overhead--rather, they took on the cold green of the\r\nevergreens. Even the white mules, their coats wet and matted into tufts,\r\nhad turned a slaty hue, and the faces of the two priests were purple and\r\nspotted in that singular light.\r\n\r\nFather Latour rode first, sitting straight upon his mule, with his chin\r\nlowered just enough to keep the drive of rain out of his eyes. Father\r\nVaillant followed, unable to see much,--in weather like this his glasses\r\nwere of no use, and he had taken them off. He crouched down in the\r\nsaddle, his shoulders well over Contento\'s neck. Father Joseph\'s sister,\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne, who was Mother Superior of a convent in her native town in\r\nthe Puy-de-D\xc3\xb4m, often tried to picture her brother and Bishop Latour on\r\nthese long missionary journeys of which he wrote her; she imagined the\r\nscene and saw the two priests moving through it in their cassocks,\r\nbare-headed, like the pictures of St. Francis Xavier with which she was\r\nfamiliar. The reality was less picturesque,--but for all that, no one\r\ncould have mistaken these two men for hunters or traders. They wore\r\nclerical collars about their necks instead of neckerchiefs, and on the\r\nbreast of his buckskin jacket the Bishop\'s silver cross hung by a silver\r\nchain.\r\n\r\nThey were on their way to Mora, the third day out, and they did not know\r\njust how far they had still to go. Since morning they had not met a\r\ntraveller or seen a human habitation. They believed they were on the\r\nright trail, for they had seen no other. The first night of their\r\njourney they had spent at Santa Cruz, lying in the warm, wide valley of\r\nthe Rio Grande, where the fields and gardens were already softly\r\ncoloured with early spring. But since they had left the Espa\xc3\xb1ola\r\ncountry behind them, they had contended first with wind and sand-storms,\r\nand now with cold. The Bishop was going to Mora to assist the Padre\r\nthere in disposing of a crowd of refugees who filled his house. A new\r\nsettlement in the Conejos valley had lately been raided by Indians; many\r\nof the inhabitants were killed, and the survivors, who were originally\r\nfrom Mora, had managed to get back there, utterly destitute.\r\n\r\nBefore the travellers had crossed the mountain meadows, the rain turned\r\nto sleet. Their wet buckskins quickly froze, and the rattle of icy\r\nflakes struck them and bounded off. The prospect of a night in the open\r\nwas not cheering. It was too wet to kindle a fire, their blankets would\r\nbecome soaked on the ground. As they were descending the mountain on the\r\nMora side, the gray daylight seemed already beginning to fail, though it\r\nwas only four o\'clock. Father Latour turned in his saddle and spoke over\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\n"The mules are certainly very tired, Joseph. They ought to be fed."\r\n\r\n"Push on," said Father Vaillant. "We will come to shelter of some kind\r\nbefore night sets in." The Vicar had been praying steadfastly while they\r\ncrossed the meadows, and he felt confident that St. Joseph would not\r\nturn a deaf ear. Before the hour was done they did indeed come upon a\r\nwretched adobe house, so poor and mean that they might not have seen it\r\nhad it not lain close beside the trail, on the edge of a steep ravine.\r\nThe stable looked more habitable than the house, and the priests thought\r\nperhaps they could spend the night in it.\r\n\r\nAs they rode up to the door, a man came out, bare-headed, and they saw\r\nto their surprise that he was not a Mexican, but an American, of a very\r\nunprepossessing type. He spoke to them in some drawling dialect they\r\ncould scarcely understand and asked if they wanted to stay the night.\r\nDuring the few words they exchanged with him Father Latour felt a\r\ngrowing reluctance to remain even for a few hours under the roof of this\r\nugly, evil-looking fellow. He was tall, gaunt and ill-formed, with a\r\nsnake-like neck, terminating in a small, bony head. Under his\r\nclose-clipped hair this repellent head showed a number of thick ridges,\r\nas if the skull joinings were overgrown by layers of superfluous bone.\r\nWith its small, rudimentary ears, this head had a positively malignant\r\nlook. The man seemed not more than half human, but he was the only\r\nhouseholder on the lonely road to Mora.\r\n\r\nThe priests dismounted and asked him whether he could put their mules\r\nunder shelter and give them grain feed.\r\n\r\n"As soon as I git my coat on I will. You kin come in."\r\n\r\nThey followed him into a room where a pi\xc3\xb1on fire blazed in the corner,\r\nand went toward it to warm their stiffened hands. Their host made an\r\nangry, snarling sound in the direction of the partition, and a woman\r\ncame out of the next room. She was a Mexican.\r\n\r\nFather Latour and Father Vaillant addressed her courteously in Spanish,\r\ngreeting her in the name of the Holy Mother, as was customary. She did\r\nnot open her lips, but stared at them blankly for a moment, then dropped\r\nher eyes and cowered as if she were terribly frightened. The priests\r\nlooked at each other; it struck them both that this man had been abusing\r\nher in some way. Suddenly he turned on her.\r\n\r\n"Clear off them cheers fur the strangers. They won\'t eat ye, if they air\r\npriests."\r\n\r\nShe began distractedly snatching rags and wet socks and dirty clothes\r\nfrom the chairs. Her hands were shaking so that she dropped things. She\r\nwas not old, she might have been very young, but she was probably\r\nhalf-witted. There was nothing in her face but blankness and fear.\r\n\r\nHer husband put on his coat and boots, went to the door, and stopped\r\nwith his hand on the latch, throwing over his shoulder a crafty, hateful\r\nglance at the bewildered woman.\r\n\r\n"Here, you! Come right along, I\'ll need ye!"\r\n\r\nShe took her black shawl from a peg and followed him. Just at the door\r\nshe turned and caught the eyes of the visitors, who were looking after\r\nher in compassion and perplexity. Instantly that stupid face became\r\nintense, prophetic, full of awful meaning. With her finger she pointed\r\nthem away, away!--two quick thrusts into the air. Then, with a look of\r\nhorror beyond anything language could convey, she threw back her head\r\nand drew the edge of her palm quickly across her distended throat--and\r\nvanished. The doorway was empty; the two priests stood staring at it,\r\nspeechless. That flash of electric passion had been so swift, the\r\nwarning it communicated so vivid and definite, that they were struck\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\nFather Joseph was the first to find his tongue. "There is no doubt of\r\nher meaning. Your pistol is loaded, Jean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I neglected to keep it dry. No matter."\r\n\r\nThey hurried out of the house. It was still light enough to see the\r\nstable through the grey drive of rain, and they went toward it.\r\n\r\n"Se\xc3\xb1or American," the Bishop called, "will you be good enough to bring\r\nout our mules?"\r\n\r\nThe man came out of the stable. "What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Our mules. We have changed our mind. We will push on to Mora. And here\r\nis a dollar for your trouble."\r\n\r\nThe man took a threatening attitude. As he looked from one to the other\r\nhis head played from side to side exactly like a snake\'s. "What\'s the\r\nmatter? My house ain\'t good enough for ye?"\r\n\r\n"No explanation is necessary. Go into the barn and get the mules, Father\r\nJoseph."\r\n\r\n"You dare go into my stable, you----priest!"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop drew his pistol. "No profanity, Se\xc3\xb1or. We want nothing from\r\nyou but to get away from your uncivil tongue. Stand where you are."\r\n\r\nThe man was unarmed. Father Joseph came out with the mules, which had\r\nnot been unsaddled. The poor things were each munching a mouthful, but\r\nthey needed no urging to be gone; they did not like this place. The\r\nmoment they felt their riders on their backs they trotted quickly along\r\nthe road, which dropped immediately into the arroyo. While they were\r\ndescending, Father Joseph remarked that the man would certainly have a\r\ngun in the house, and that he had no wish to be shot in the back.\r\n\r\n"Nor I. But it is growing too dark for that, unless he should follow us\r\non horseback," said the Bishop. "Were there horses in the stable?"\r\n\r\n"Only a burro." Father Vaillant was relying upon the protection of St.\r\nJoseph, whose office he had fervently said that morning. The warning\r\ngiven them by that poor woman, with such scant opportunity, seemed\r\nevidence that some protecting power was mindful of them.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had ascended the far side of the arroyo, night had\r\nclosed down and the rain was pouring harder than ever.\r\n\r\n"I am by no means sure that we can keep in the road," said the Bishop.\r\n"But at least I am sure we are not being followed. We must trust to\r\nthese intelligent beasts. Poor woman! He will suspect her and abuse her,\r\nI am afraid." He kept seeing her in the darkness as he rode on, her face\r\nin the fire-light, and her terrible pantomime.\r\n\r\nThey reached the town of Mora a little after midnight. The Padre\'s house\r\nwas full of refugees, and two of them were put out of a bed in order\r\nthat the Bishop and his Vicar could get into it.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a boy came from the stable and reported that he had found\r\na crazy woman lying in the straw, and that she begged to see the two\r\nPadres who owned the white mules. She was brought in, her clothing cut\r\nto rags, her legs and face and even her hair so plastered with mud that\r\nthe priests could scarcely recognize the woman who had saved their lives\r\nthe night before.\r\n\r\nShe said she had never gone back to the house at all. When the two\r\npriests rode away her husband had run to the house to get his gun, and\r\nshe had plunged down a wash-out behind the stable into the arroyo, and\r\nhad been on the way to Mora all night. She had supposed he would\r\novertake her and kill her, but he had not. She reached the settlement\r\nbefore day-break, and crept into the stable to warm herself among the\r\nanimals and wait until the household was awake. Kneeling before the\r\nBishop she began to relate such horrible things that he stopped her and\r\nturned to the native priest.\r\n\r\n"This is a case for the civil authorities. Is there a magistrate here?"\r\n\r\nThere was no magistrate, but there was a retired fur trapper who acted\r\nas notary and could take evidence. He was sent for, and in the interval\r\nFather Latour instructed the refugee women from Conejos to bathe this\r\npoor creature and put decent clothes on her, and to care for the cuts\r\nand scratches on her legs.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the woman, whose name was Magdalena, calmed by food and\r\nkindness, was ready to tell her story. The notary had brought along his\r\nfriend, St. Vrain, a Canadian trapper who understood Spanish better than\r\nhe. The woman was known to St. Vrain, moreover, who confirmed her\r\nstatement that she was born Magdalena Valdez, at Los Ranchos de Taos,\r\nand that she was twenty-four years old. Her husband, Buck Scales, had\r\ndrifted into Taos with a party of hunters from somewhere in Wyoming. All\r\nwhite men knew him for a dog and a degenerate--but to Mexican girls,\r\nmarriage with an American meant coming up in the world. She had married\r\nhim six years ago, and had been living with him ever since in that\r\nwretched house on the Mora trail. During that time he had robbed and\r\nmurdered four travellers who had stopped there for the night. They were\r\nall strangers, not known in the country. She had forgot their names, but\r\none was a German boy who spoke very little Spanish and little English;\r\na nice boy with blue eyes, and she had grieved for him more than for the\r\nothers. They were all buried in the sandy soil behind the stable. She\r\nwas always afraid their bodies might wash out in a storm. Their horses\r\nBuck had ridden off by night and sold to Indians somewhere in the north.\r\nMagdalena had borne three children since her marriage, and her husband\r\nhad killed each of them a few days after birth, by ways so horrible that\r\nshe could not relate it. After he killed the first baby, she ran away\r\nfrom him, back to her parents at Ranchos. He came after her and made her\r\ngo home with him by threatening harm to the old people. She was afraid\r\nto go anywhere for help, but twice before she had managed to warn\r\ntravellers away, when her husband happened to be out of the house. This\r\ntime she had found courage because, when she looked into the faces of\r\nthese two Padres, she knew they were good men, and she thought if she\r\nran after them they could save her. She could not bear any more killing.\r\nShe asked nothing better than to die herself, if only she could hide\r\nnear a church and a priest for a while, to make her soul right with God.\r\n\r\nSt. Vrain and his friend got together a search-party at once. They rode\r\nout to Scales\'s place and found the remains of four men buried under the\r\ncorral behind the stable, as the woman had said. Scales himself they\r\ncaptured on the road from Taos, where he had gone to look for his wife.\r\nThey brought him back to Mora, but St. Vrain rode on to Taos to fetch a\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nThere was no _calabozo_ in Mora, so Scales was put into an empty stable,\r\nunder guard. This stable was soon surrounded by a crowd of people, who\r\nloitered to hear the blood-curdling threats the prisoner shouted against\r\nhis wife. Magdalena was kept in the Padre\'s house, where she lay on a\r\nmat in the corner, begging Father Latour to take her back to Santa F\xc3\xa9,\r\nso that her husband could not get at her. Though Scales was bound, the\r\nBishop felt alarmed for her safety. He and the American notary, who had\r\na pistol of the new revolver model, sat in the _sala_ and kept watch\r\nover her all night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the magistrate and his party arrived from Taos. The\r\nnotary told him the facts of the case in the plaza, where everyone could\r\nhear. The Bishop inquired whether there was any place for Magdalena in\r\nTaos, as she could not stay on here in such a state of terror.\r\n\r\nA man dressed in buckskin hunting-clothes stepped out of the crowd and\r\nasked to see Magdalena. Father Latour conducted him into the room where\r\nshe lay on her mat. The stranger went up to her, removing his hat. He\r\nbent down and put his hand on her shoulder. Though he was clearly an\r\nAmerican, he spoke Spanish in the native manner.\r\n\r\n"Magdalena, don\'t you remember me?"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him as out of a dark well; something became alive in\r\nher deep, haunted eyes. She caught with both hands at his fringed\r\nbuckskin knees.\r\n\r\n"Christobal!" she wailed. "Oh, Christobal!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take you home with me, Magdalena, and you can stay with my wife.\r\nYou wouldn\'t be afraid in my house, would you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, Christobal, I would not be afraid with you. I am not a wicked\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\nHe smoothed her hair. "You\'re a good girl, Magdalena--always were. It\r\nwill be all right. Just leave things to me."\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the Bishop. "Se\xc3\xb1or Vicario, she can come to me. I\r\nlive near Taos. My wife is a native woman, and she\'ll be good to her.\r\nThat varmint won\'t come about my place, even if he breaks jail. He knows\r\nme. My name is Carson."\r\n\r\nFather Latour had looked forward to meeting the scout. He had supposed\r\nhim to be a very large man, of powerful body and commanding presence.\r\nThis Carson was not so tall as the Bishop himself, was very slight in\r\nframe, modest in manner, and he spoke English with a soft Southern\r\ndrawl. His face was both thoughtful and alert; anxiety had drawn a\r\npermanent ridge between his blue eyes. Under his blond moustache his\r\nmouth had a singular refinement. The lips were full and delicately\r\nmodelled. There was something curiously unconscious about his mouth,\r\nreflective, a little melancholy,--and something that suggested a\r\ncapacity for tenderness. The Bishop felt a quick glow of pleasure in\r\nlooking at the man. As he stood there in his buckskin clothes one felt\r\nin him standards, loyalties, a code which is not easily put into words\r\nbut which is instantly felt when two men who live by it come together by\r\nchance. He took the scout\'s hand. "I have long wanted to meet Kit\r\nCarson," he said, "even before I came to New Mexico. I have been hoping\r\nyou would pay me a visit at Santa F\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\nThe other smiled. "I\'m right shy, sir, and I\'m always afraid of being\r\ndisappointed. But I guess it will be all right from now on."\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a long friendship.\r\n\r\nOn their ride back to Carson\'s ranch, Magdalena was put in Father\r\nVaillant\'s care, and the Bishop and the scout rode together. Carson said\r\nhe had become a Catholic merely as a matter of form, as Americans\r\nusually did when they married a Mexican girl. His wife was a good woman\r\nand very devout; but religion had seemed to him pretty much a woman\'s\r\naffair until his last trip to California. He had been sick out there,\r\nand the Fathers at one of the missions took care of him. "I began to see\r\nthings different, and thought I might some day be a Catholic in earnest.\r\nI was brought up to think priests were rascals, and that the nuns were\r\nbad women,--all the stuff they talk back in Missouri. A good many of the\r\nnative priests here bear out that story. Our Padre Martinez at Taos is\r\nan old scapegrace, if ever there was one; he\'s got children and\r\ngrandchildren in almost every settlement around here. And Padre Lucero\r\nat Arroyo Hondo is a miser, takes everything a poor man\'s got to give\r\nhim a Christian burial."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop discussed the needs of his people at length with Carson. He\r\nfelt great confidence in his judgment. The two men were about the same\r\nage, both a little over forty, and both had been sobered and sharpened\r\nby wide experience. Carson had been guide in world-renowned\r\nexplorations, but he was still almost as poor as in the days when he was\r\na beaver trapper. He lived in a little adobe house with his Mexican\r\nwife. The great country of desert and mountain ranges between Santa F\xc3\xa9\r\nand the Pacific coast was not yet mapped or charted; the most reliable\r\nmap of it was in Kit Carson\'s brain. This Missourian, whose eye was so\r\nquick to read a landscape or a human face, could not read a printed\r\npage. He could at that time barely write his own name. Yet one felt in\r\nhim a quick and discriminating intelligence. That he was illiterate was\r\nan accident; he had got ahead of books, gone where the printing-press\r\ncould not follow him. Out of the hardships of his boyhood--from fourteen\r\nto twenty picking up a bare living as cook or mule-driver for wagon\r\ntrains, often in the service of brutal and desperate characters--he had\r\npreserved a clean sense of honour and a compassionate heart. In talking\r\nto the Bishop of poor Magdalena he said sadly: "I used to see her in\r\nTaos when she was such a pretty girl. Ain\'t it a pity?"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe degenerate murderer, Buck Scales, was hanged after a short trial.\r\nEarly in April the Bishop left Santa F\xc3\xa9 on horseback and rode to St.\r\nLouis, on his way to attend the Provincial Council at Baltimore. When he\r\nreturned in September, he brought back with him five courageous nuns,\r\nSisters of Loretto, to found a school for girls in letterless Santa F\xc3\xa9.\r\nHe sent at once for Magdalena and took her into the service of the\r\nSisters. She became housekeeper and manager of the Sisters\' kitchen. She\r\nwas devoted to the nuns, and so happy in the service of the Church that\r\nwhen the Bishop visited the school he used to enter by the\r\nkitchen-garden in order to see her serene and handsome face. For she\r\nbecame beautiful, as Carson said she had been as a girl. After the\r\nblight of her horrible youth was over, she seemed to bloom again in the\r\nhousehold of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THREE\r\n\r\n_THE MASS AT \xc3\x81COMA_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE WOODEN PARROT\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the first year after his arrival in Santa F\xc3\xa9, the Bishop was\r\nactually in his diocese only about four months. Six months of that first\r\nyear were consumed in attending the Plenary Council at Baltimore, to\r\nwhich he had been summoned. He went on horseback over the Santa F\xc3\xa9\r\ntrail to St. Louis, nearly a thousand miles, then by steamboat to\r\nPittsburgh, across the mountains to Cumberland, and on to Washington by\r\nthe new railroad. The return journey was even slower, as he had with him\r\nthe five nuns who came to found the school of Our Lady of Light. He\r\nreached Santa F\xc3\xa9 late in September.\r\n\r\nSo far, Bishop Latour had been mainly employed on business that took him\r\nfar away from his Vicarate. His great diocese was still an unimaginable\r\nmystery to him. He was eager to be abroad in it, to know his people; to\r\nescape for a little from the cares of building and founding, and to go\r\nwestward among the old isolated Indian missions; Santo Domingo, breeder\r\nof horses; Isleta, whitened with gypsum; Laguna, of wide pastures; and\r\nfinally, cloud-set \xc3\x81coma.\r\n\r\nIn the golden October weather the Bishop, with his blankets and\r\ncoffee-pot, attended by Jacinto, a young Indian from the Pecos pueblo,\r\nwhom he employed as guide, set off to visit the Indian missions in the\r\nwest. He spent a night and a day at Albuquerque, with the genial and\r\npopular Padre Gallegos. After Santa F\xc3\xa9, Albuquerque was the most\r\nimportant parish in the diocese; the priest belonged to an influential\r\nMexican family, and he and the _rancheros_ had run their church to suit\r\nthemselves, making a very gay affair of it. Though Padre Gallegos was\r\nten years older than the Bishop, he would still dance the fandango five\r\nnights running, as if he could never have enough of it. He had many\r\nfriends in the American colony, with whom he played poker and went\r\nhunting, when he was not dancing with the Mexicans. His cellar was well\r\nstocked with wines from El Paso del Norte, whisky from Taos, and grape\r\nbrandy from Bernalillo. He was genuinely hospitable, and the gambler\r\ndown on his luck, the soldier sobering up, were always welcome at his\r\ntable. The Padre was adored by a rich Mexican widow, who was hostess at\r\nhis supper parties, engaged his servants for him, made lace for the\r\naltar and napery for his table. Every Sunday her carriage, the only\r\nclosed one in Albuquerque, waited in the plaza after Mass, and when the\r\npriest had put off his vestments, he came out and was driven away to the\r\nlady\'s hacienda for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop and Father Vaillant had thoroughly examined the case of\r\nFather Gallegos, and meant to end this scandalous state of things well\r\nbefore Christmas. But on this visit Father Latour exhibited neither\r\nastonishment nor displeasure at anything, and Padre Gallegos was cordial\r\nand most ceremoniously polite. When the Bishop permitted himself to\r\nexpress some surprise that there was not a confirmation class awaiting\r\nhim, the Padre explained smoothly that it was his custom to confirm\r\ninfants at their baptism.\r\n\r\n"It is all the same in a Christian community like ours. We know they\r\nwill receive religious instruction as they grow up, so we make good\r\nCatholics of them in the beginning. Why not?"\r\n\r\nThe Padre was uneasy lest the Bishop should require his attendance on\r\nthis trip out among the missions. He had no liking for scanty food and a\r\nbed on the rocks. So, though he had been dancing only a few nights\r\nbefore, he received his Superior with one foot bandaged up in an Indian\r\nmoccasin, and complained of a severe attack of gout. Asked when he had\r\nlast celebrated Mass at \xc3\x81coma, he made no direct reply. It used to be\r\nhis custom, he said, to go there in Passion Week, but the \xc3\x81coma Indians\r\nwere unreclaimed heathen at heart, and had no wish to be bothered with\r\nthe Mass. The last time he went out there, he was unable to get into the\r\nchurch at all. The Indians pretended they had not the key; that the\r\nGovernor had it, and that he had gone on "Indian business" up into the\r\nCebolleta mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop did not wish Padre Gallegos\'s company upon his journey, was\r\nvery glad not to have the embarrassment of refusing it, and he rode away\r\nfrom Albuquerque after polite farewells. Yet, he reflected, there was\r\nsomething very engaging about Gallegos as a man. As a priest, he was\r\nimpossible; he was too self-satisfied and popular ever to change his\r\nways, and he certainly could not change his face. He did not look quite\r\nlike a professional gambler, but something smooth and twinkling in his\r\ncountenance suggested an underhanded mode of life. There was but one\r\ncourse: to suspend the man from the exercise of all priestly functions,\r\nand bid the smaller native priests take warning.\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant had told the Bishop that he must by all means stop a\r\nnight at Isleta, as he would like the priest there--Padre Jesus de Baca,\r\nan old white-haired man, almost blind, who had been at Isleta many years\r\nand had won the confidence and affection of his Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen he approached this pueblo of Isleta, gleaming white across a low\r\nplain of grey sand, Father Latour\'s spirits rose. It was beautiful, that\r\nwarm, rich whiteness of the church and the clustered town, shaded by a\r\nfew bright acacia trees, with their intense blue-green like the colour\r\nof old paper window-blinds. That tree always awakened pleasant memories,\r\nrecalling a garden in the south of France where he used to visit young\r\ncousins. As he rode up to the church, the old priest came out to meet\r\nhim, and after his salutation stood looking at Father Latour, shading\r\nhis failing eyes with his hand.\r\n\r\n"And can this be my Bishop? So young a man?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThey went into the priest\'s house by way of a garden, walled in behind\r\nthe church. This enclosure was full of domesticated cactus plants, of\r\nmany varieties and great size (it seemed the Padre loved them), and\r\namong these hung wicker cages made of willow twigs, full of parrots.\r\nThere were even parrots hopping about the sanded paths,--with one wing\r\nclipped to keep them at home. Father Jesus explained that parrot\r\nfeathers were much prized by his Indians as ornaments for their\r\nceremonial robes, and he had long ago found he could please his\r\nparishioners by raising the birds.\r\n\r\nThe priest\'s house was white within and without, like all the Isleta\r\nhouses, and was almost as bare as an Indian dwelling. The old man was\r\npoor, and too soft-hearted to press the pueblo people for pesos. An\r\nIndian girl cooked his beans and cornmeal mush for him, he required\r\nlittle else. The girl was not very skilful, he said, but she was clean\r\nabout her cooking. When the Bishop remarked that everything in this\r\npueblo, even the streets, seemed clean, the Padre told him that near\r\nIsleta there was a hill of some white mineral, which the Indians ground\r\nup and used as whitewash. They had done this from time immemorial, and\r\nthe village had always been noted for its whiteness. A little talk with\r\nFather Jesus revealed that he was simple almost to childishness, and\r\nvery superstitious. But there was a quality of golden goodness about\r\nhim. His right eye was overgrown by a cataract, and he kept his head\r\ntilted as if he were trying to see around it. All his movements were to\r\nthe left, as if he were reaching or walking about some obstacle in his\r\npath.\r\n\r\nAfter coming to the house by way of a garden full of parrots, Father\r\nLatour was amused to find that the sole ornament in the Padre\'s poor,\r\nbare little _sala_ was a wooden parrot, perched in a hoop and hung from\r\none of the roof-logs. While Father Jesus was instructing his Indian girl\r\nin the kitchen, the Bishop took this carving down from its perch to\r\nexamine it. It was cut from a single stick of wood, exactly the size of\r\na living bird, body and tail rigid and straight, the head a little\r\nturned. The wings and tail and neck feathers were just indicated by the\r\ntool, and thinly painted. He was surprised to feel how light it was; the\r\nsurface had the whiteness and velvety smoothness of very old wood.\r\nThough scarcely carved at all, merely smoothed into shape, it was\r\nstrangely lifelike; a wooden pattern of parrots, as it were.\r\n\r\nThe Padre smiled when he found the Bishop with the bird in his hand.\r\n\r\n"I see you have found my treasure! That, your Grace, is probably the\r\noldest thing in the pueblo--older than the pueblo itself."\r\n\r\nThe parrot, Father Jesus said, had always been the bird of wonder and\r\ndesire to the pueblo Indians. In ancient times its feathers were more\r\nvalued than wampum and turquoises. Even before the Spaniards came, the\r\npueblos of northern New Mexico used to send explorers along the\r\ndangerous and difficult trade routes down into tropical Mexico to bring\r\nback upon their bodies a cargo of parrot feathers. To purchase these the\r\ntrader carried pouches full of turquoises from the Cerrillos hills near\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9. When, very rarely, a trader succeeded in bringing back a live\r\nbird to his people, it was paid divine honours, and its death threw the\r\nwhole village into the deepest gloom. Even the bones were piously\r\npreserved. There was in Isleta a parrot skull of great antiquity. His\r\nwooden bird he had bought from an old man who was much indebted to him,\r\nand who was about to die without descendants. Father Jesus had had his\r\neye upon the bird for years. The Indian told him that his ancestors,\r\ngenerations ago, had brought it with them from the mother pueblo. The\r\npriest fondly believed that it was a portrait, done from life, of one of\r\nthose rare birds that in ancient times were carried up alive, all the\r\nlong trail from the tropics.\r\n\r\nFather Jesus gave a good report of the Indians at Laguna and \xc3\x81coma. He\r\nused to go to those pueblos to hold services when he was younger, and\r\nhad always found them friendly.\r\n\r\n"At \xc3\x81coma," he said, "you can see something very holy. They have there\r\na portrait of St. Joseph, sent to them by one of the Kings of Spain,\r\nlong ago, and it has worked many miracles. If the season is dry, the\r\n\xc3\x81coma people take the picture down to their farms at Acomita, and it\r\nnever fails to produce rain. They have rain when none falls in all the\r\ncountry, and they have crops when the Laguna Indians have none."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nJACINTO\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING leave of Isleta and its priest early in the morning, Father\r\nLatour and his guide rode all day through the dry desert plain west of\r\nAlbuquerque. It was like a country of dry ashes; no juniper, no rabbit\r\nbrush, nothing but thickets of withered, dead-looking cactus, and\r\npatches of wild pumpkin--the only vegetation that had any vitality. It\r\nis a vine, remarkable for its tendency, not to spread and ramble, but to\r\nmass and mount. Its long, sharp, arrow-shaped leaves, frosted over with\r\nprickly silver, are thrust upward and crowded together; the whole rigid,\r\nup-thrust matted clump looks less like a plant than like a great colony\r\nof grey-green lizards, moving and suddenly arrested by fear.\r\n\r\nAs the morning wore on they had to make their way through a sand-storm\r\nwhich quite obscured the sun. Jacinto knew the country well, having\r\ncrossed it often to go to the religious dances at Laguna, but he rode\r\nwith his head low and a purple handkerchief tied over his mouth. Coming\r\nfrom a pueblo among woods and water, he had a poor opinion of this\r\nplain. At noon he alighted and collected enough greasewood to boil the\r\nBishop\'s coffee. They knelt on either side of the fire, the sand curling\r\nabout them so that the bread became gritty as they ate it.\r\n\r\nThe sun set red in an atmosphere murky with sand. The travellers made a\r\ndry camp and rolled themselves in their blankets. All night a cold wind\r\nblew over them. Father Latour was so stiff that he arose long before\r\nday-break. The dawn came at last, fair and clear, and they made an early\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of that afternoon Jacinto pointed out Laguna in the\r\ndistance, lying, apparently, in the midst of bright yellow waves of high\r\nsand dunes--yellow as ochre. As they approached, Father Latour found\r\nthese were petrified sand dunes; long waves of soft, gritty yellow rock,\r\nshining and bare except for a few lines of dark juniper that grew out of\r\nthe weather cracks,--little trees, and very, very old. At the foot of\r\nthis sweep of rock waves was the blue lake, a stone basin full of water,\r\nfrom which the pueblo took its name.\r\n\r\nThe kindly Padre at Isleta had sent his cook\'s brother off on foot to\r\nwarn the Laguna people that the new High Priest was coming, and that he\r\nwas a good man and did not want money. They were prepared, accordingly;\r\nthe church was clean and the doors were open; a small white church,\r\npainted above and about the altar with gods of wind and rain and\r\nthunder, sun and moon, linked together in a geometrical design of\r\ncrimson and blue and dark green, so that the end of the church seemed to\r\nbe hung with tapestry. It recalled to Father Latour the interior of a\r\nPersian chieftain\'s tent he had seen in a textile exhibit at Lyons.\r\nWhether this decoration had been done by Spanish missionaries or by\r\nIndian converts, he was unable to find out.\r\n\r\nThe Governor told him that his people would come to Mass in the morning,\r\nand that there were a number of children to be baptized. He offered the\r\nBishop the sacristy for the night, but there was a damp, earthy smell\r\nabout that chamber, and Father Latour had already made up his mind that\r\nhe would like to sleep on the rock dunes, under the junipers.\r\n\r\nJacinto got firewood and good water from the Lagunas, and they made\r\ntheir camp in a pleasant spot on the rocks north of the village. As the\r\nsun dropped low, the light brought the white church and the yellow adobe\r\nhouses up into relief from the flat ledges. Behind their camp, not far\r\naway, lay a group of great mesas. The Bishop asked Jacinto if he knew\r\nthe name of the one nearest them.\r\n\r\n"No, I not know any name," he shook his head. "I know Indian name," he\r\nadded, as if, for once, he were thinking aloud.\r\n\r\n"And what is the Indian name?"\r\n\r\n"The Laguna Indians call Snow-Bird mountain." He spoke somewhat\r\nunwillingly.\r\n\r\n"That is very nice," said the Bishop musingly. "Yes, that is a pretty\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Indians have nice names too!" Jacinto replied quickly, with a curl\r\nof the lip. Then, as if he felt he had taken out on the Bishop a\r\nreproach not deserved, he said in a moment: "The Laguna people think it\r\nvery funny for a big priest to be a young man. The Governor say, how can\r\nI call him Padre when he is younger than my sons?"\r\n\r\nThere was a note of pride in Jacinto\'s voice very flattering to the\r\nBishop. He had noticed how kind the Indian voice could be when it was\r\nkind at all; a slight inflection made one feel that one had received a\r\ngreat compliment.\r\n\r\n"I am not very young in heart, Jacinto. How old are you, my boy?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-six."\r\n\r\n"Have you a son?"\r\n\r\n"One. Baby. Not very long born."\r\n\r\nJacinto usually dropped the article in speaking Spanish, just as he did\r\nin speaking English, though the Bishop had noticed that when he did give\r\na noun its article, he used the right one. The customary omission,\r\ntherefore, seemed to be a matter of taste, not ignorance. In the Indian\r\nconception of language, such attachments were superfluous and\r\nunpleasing, perhaps.\r\n\r\nThey relapsed into the silence which was their usual form of\r\nintercourse. The Bishop sat drinking his coffee slowly out of the tin\r\ncup, keeping the pot near the embers. The sun had set now, the yellow\r\nrocks were turning grey, down in the pueblo the light of the cook fires\r\nmade red patches of the glassless windows, and the smell of pi\xc3\xb1on smoke\r\ncame softly through the still air. The whole western sky was the colour\r\nof golden ashes, with here and there a flush of red on the lip of a\r\nlittle cloud. High above the horizon the evening-star flickered like a\r\nlamp just lit, and close beside it was another star of constant light,\r\nmuch smaller.\r\n\r\nJacinto threw away the end of his cornhusk cigarette and again spoke\r\nwithout being addressed.\r\n\r\n"The ev-en-ing-star," he said in English, slowly and somewhat\r\nsententiously, then relapsed into Spanish. "You see the little star\r\nbeside, Padre? Indians call him the guide."\r\n\r\nThe two companions sat, each thinking his own thoughts as night closed\r\nin about them; a blue night set with stars, the bulk of the solitary\r\nmesas cutting into the firmament. The Bishop seldom questioned Jacinto\r\nabout his thoughts or beliefs. He didn\'t think it polite, and he\r\nbelieved it to be useless. There was no way in which he could transfer\r\nhis own memories of European civilization into the Indian mind, and he\r\nwas quite willing to believe that behind Jacinto there was a long\r\ntradition, a story of experience, which no language could translate to\r\nhim. A chill came with the darkness. Father Latour put on his old\r\nfur-lined cloak, and Jacinto, loosening the blanket tied about his\r\nloins, drew it up over his head and shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Many stars," he said presently. "What you think about the stars,\r\nPadre?"\r\n\r\n"The wise men tell us they are worlds, like ours, Jacinto."\r\n\r\nThe end of the Indian\'s cigarette grew bright and then dull again before\r\nhe spoke. "I think not," he said in the tone of one who has considered a\r\nproposition fairly and rejected it. "I think they are leaders--great\r\nspirits."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they are," said the Bishop with a sigh. "Whatever they are,\r\nthey are great. Let us say _Our Father_, and go to sleep, my boy."\r\n\r\nKneeling on either side of the embers they repeated the prayer together\r\nand then rolled up in their blankets. The Bishop went to sleep thinking\r\nwith satisfaction that he was beginning to have some sort of human\r\ncompanionship with his Indian boy. One called the young Indians "boys,"\r\nperhaps because there was something youthful and elastic in their\r\nbodies. Certainly about their behaviour there was nothing boyish in the\r\nAmerican sense, nor even in the European sense. Jacinto was never, by\r\nany chance, na\xc3\xaff; he was never taken by surprise. One felt that his\r\ntraining, whatever it had been, had prepared him to meet any situation\r\nwhich might confront him. He was as much at home in the Bishop\'s study\r\nas in his own pueblo--and he was never too much at home anywhere. Father\r\nLatour felt he had gone a good way toward gaining his guide\'s friendship,\r\nthough he did not know how.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, Jacinto liked the Bishop\'s way of meeting people; thought\r\nhe had the right tone with Padre Gallegos, the right tone with Padre\r\nJesus, and that he had good manners with the Indians. In his experience,\r\nwhite people, when they addressed Indians, always put on a false face.\r\nThere were many kinds of false faces; Father Vaillant\'s, for example,\r\nwas kindly but too vehement. The Bishop put on none at all. He stood\r\nstraight and turned to the Governor of Laguna, and his face underwent no\r\nchange. Jacinto thought this remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTHE ROCK\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER early Mass the next morning Father Latour and his guide rode off\r\nacross the low plain that lies between Laguna and \xc3\x81coma. In all his\r\ntravels the Bishop had seen no country like this. From the flat red sea\r\nof sand rose great rock mesas, generally Gothic in outline, resembling\r\nvast cathedrals. They were not crowded together in disorder, but placed\r\nin wide spaces, long vistas between. This plain might once have been an\r\nenormous city, all the smaller quarters destroyed by time, only the\r\npublic buildings left,--piles of architecture that were like mountains.\r\nThe sandy soil of the plain had a light sprinkling of junipers, and was\r\nsplotched with masses of blooming rabbit brush,--that olive-coloured\r\nplant that grows in high waves like a tossing sea, at this season\r\ncovered with a thatch of bloom, yellow as gorse, or orange like\r\nmarigolds.\r\n\r\nThis mesa plain had an appearance of great antiquity, and of\r\nincompleteness; as if, with all the materials for world-making\r\nassembled, the Creator had desisted, gone away and left everything on\r\nthe point of being brought together, on the eve of being arranged into\r\nmountain, plain, plateau. The country was still waiting to be made into\r\na landscape.\r\n\r\nEver afterward the Bishop remembered his first ride to \xc3\x81coma as his\r\nintroduction to the mesa country. One thing which struck him at once was\r\nthat every mesa was duplicated by a cloud mesa, like a reflection, which\r\nlay motionless above it or moved slowly up from behind it. These cloud\r\nformations seemed to be always there, however hot and blue the sky.\r\nSometimes they were flat terraces, ledges of vapour; sometimes they were\r\ndome-shaped, or fantastic, like the tops of silvery pagodas, rising one\r\nabove another, as if an oriental city lay directly behind the rock. The\r\ngreat tables of granite set down in an empty plain were inconceivable\r\nwithout their attendant clouds, which were a part of them, as the smoke\r\nis part of the censer, or the foam of the wave.\r\n\r\nComing along the Santa F\xc3\xa9 trail, in the vast plains of Kansas, Father\r\nLatour had found the sky more a desert than the land; a hard, empty\r\nblue, very monotonous to the eyes of a Frenchman. But west of the Pecos\r\nall that changed; here there was always activity overhead, clouds\r\nforming and moving all day long. Whether they were dark and full of\r\nviolence, or soft and white with luxurious idleness, they powerfully\r\naffected the world beneath them. The desert, the mountains and mesas,\r\nwere continually re-formed and re-coloured by the cloud shadows. The\r\nwhole country seemed fluid to the eye under this constant change of\r\naccent, this ever-varying distribution of light.\r\n\r\nJacinto interrupted these reflections by an exclamation.\r\n\r\n"\xc3\x81coma!" He stopped his mule.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, following with his eye the straight, pointing Indian hand,\r\nsaw, far away, two great mesas. They were almost square in shape, and at\r\nthis distance seemed close together, though they were really some miles\r\napart.\r\n\r\n"The far one"--his guide still pointed.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop\'s eyes were not so sharp as Jacinto\'s, but now, looking down\r\nupon the top of the farther mesa from the high land on which they\r\nhalted, he saw a flat white outline on the grey surface--a white square\r\nmade up of squares. That, his guide said, was the pueblo of \xc3\x81coma.\r\n\r\nRiding on, they presently drew rein under the Enchanted Mesa, and\r\nJacinto told him that on this, too, there had once been a village, but\r\nthe stairway which had been the only access to it was broken off by a\r\ngreat storm many centuries ago, and its people had perished up there\r\nfrom hunger.\r\n\r\nBut how, the Bishop asked him, did men first think of living on the top\r\nof naked rocks like these, hundreds of feet in the air, without soil or\r\nwater?\r\n\r\nJacinto shrugged. "A man can do whole lot when they hunt him day and\r\nnight like an animal. Navajos on the north, Apaches on the south; the\r\n\xc3\x81coma run up a rock to be safe."\r\n\r\nAll this plain, the Bishop gathered, had once been the scene of a\r\nperiodic man-hunt; these Indians, born in fear and dying by violence for\r\ngenerations, had at last taken this leap away from the earth, and on\r\nthat rock had found the hope of all suffering and tormented\r\ncreatures--safety. They came down to the plain to hunt and to grow their\r\ncrops, but there was always a place to go back to. If a band of Navajos\r\nwere on the \xc3\x81coma\'s trail, there was still one hope; if he could reach\r\nhis rock--Sanctuary! On the winding stone stairway up the cliff, a\r\nhandful of men could keep off a multitude. The rock of \xc3\x81coma had never\r\nbeen taken by a foe but once,--by Spaniards in armour. It was very\r\ndifferent from a mountain fastness; more lonely, more stark and grim,\r\nmore appealing to the imagination. The rock, when one came to think of\r\nit, was the utmost expression of human need; even mere feeling yearned\r\nfor it; it was the highest comparison of loyalty in love and friendship.\r\nChrist Himself had used that comparison for the disciple to whom He gave\r\nthe keys of His Church. And the Hebrews of the Old Testament, always\r\nbeing carried captive into foreign lands,--their rock was an idea of\r\nGod, the only thing their conquerors could not take from them.\r\n\r\nAlready the Bishop had observed in Indian life a strange literalness,\r\noften shocking and disconcerting. The \xc3\x81comas, who must share the\r\nuniversal human yearning for something permanent, enduring, without\r\nshadow of change,--they had their idea in substance. They actually lived\r\nupon their Rock; were born upon it and died upon it. There was an\r\nelement of exaggeration in anything so simple!\r\n\r\nAs they drew near the \xc3\x81coma mesa, dark clouds began boiling up from\r\nbehind it, like ink spots spreading in a brilliant sky.\r\n\r\n"Rain come," remarked Jacinto. "That is good. They will be well\r\ndisposed." He left the mules in a stake corral at the foot of the mesa,\r\ntook up the blankets, and hurried Father Latour into the narrow crack in\r\nthe rock where the craggy edges formed a kind of natural stairway up the\r\ncliff. Wherever the footing was treacherous, it was helped out by little\r\nhandholds, ground into the stone like smooth mittens. The mesa was\r\nabsolutely naked of vegetation, but at its foot a rank plant grew\r\nconspicuously out of the sand; a plant with big white blossoms like\r\nEaster lilies. By its dark blue-green leaves, large and coarse-toothed,\r\nFather Latour recognized a species of the noxious datura. The size and\r\nluxuriance of these nightshades astonished him. They looked like great\r\nartificial plants, made of shining silk.\r\n\r\nWhile they were ascending the rock, deafening thunder broke over their\r\nheads, and the rain began to fall as if it were spilled from a\r\ncloud-burst. Drawing into a deep twist of the stairway, under an\r\noverhanging ledge, they watched the water shaken in heavy curtains in\r\nthe air before them. In a moment the seam in which they stood was like\r\nthe channel of a brook. Looking out over the great plain spotted with\r\nmesas and glittering with rain sheets, the Bishop saw the distant\r\nmountains bright with sunlight. Again he thought that the first Creation\r\nmorning might have looked like this, when the dry land was first drawn\r\nup out of the deep, and all was confusion.\r\n\r\nThe storm was over in half an hour. By the time the Bishop and his guide\r\nreached the last turn in the trail, and rose through the crack, stepping\r\nout on the flat top of the rock, the noontide sun was blazing down upon\r\n\xc3\x81coma with almost insupportable brightness. The bare stone floor of the\r\ntown and its deepworn paths were washed white and clean, and those\r\ndepressions in the surface which the \xc3\x81comas call their cisterns, were\r\nfull of fresh rain water. Already the women were bringing out their\r\nclothes, to begin washing. The drinking water was carried up the\r\nstairway in earthen jars on the heads of the women, from a secret spring\r\nbelow; but for all other purposes the people depended on the rainfall\r\nheld in these cisterns.\r\n\r\nThe top of the mesa was about ten acres in extent, the Bishop judged,\r\nand there was not a tree or a blade of green upon it; not a handful of\r\nsoil, except the churchyard, held in by an adobe wall, where the earth\r\nfor burial had been carried up in baskets from the plain below. The\r\nwhite dwellings, two and three storeyed, were not scattered, but huddled\r\ntogether in a close cluster, with no protecting slope of ground or\r\nshoulder of rock, lying flat against the flat, bright against the\r\nbright,--both the rock and the plastered houses threw off the sun glare\r\nblindingly.\r\n\r\nAt the very edge of the mesa, overhanging the abyss so that its\r\nretaining wall was like a part of the cliff itself, was the old warlike\r\nchurch of \xc3\x81coma, with its two stone towers. Gaunt, grim, grey, its nave\r\nrising some seventy feet to a sagging, half-ruined roof, it was more\r\nlike a fortress than a place of worship. That spacious interior\r\ndepressed the Bishop as no other mission church had done. He held a\r\nservice there before midday, and he had never found it so hard to go\r\nthrough the ceremony of the Mass. Before him, on the grey floor, in the\r\ngrey light, a group of bright shawls and blankets, some fifty or sixty\r\nsilent faces; above and behind them the grey walls. He felt as if he\r\nwere celebrating Mass at the bottom of the sea, for antediluvian\r\ncreatures; for types of life so old, so hardened, so shut within their\r\nshells, that the sacrifice on Calvary could hardly reach back so far.\r\nThose shell-like backs behind him might be saved by baptism and divine\r\ngrace, as undeveloped infants are, but hardly through any experience of\r\ntheir own, he thought. When he blessed them and sent them away, it was\r\nwith a sense of inadequacy and spiritual defeat.\r\n\r\nAfter he had laid aside his vestments, Father Latour went over the\r\nchurch with Jacinto. As he examined it his wonder grew. What need had\r\nthere ever been for this great church at \xc3\x81coma? It was built early in\r\nsixteen hundred, by Fray Juan Ramirez, a great missionary, who laboured\r\non the Rock of \xc3\x81coma for twenty years or more. It was Father Ramirez,\r\ntoo, who made the mule trail down the other side,--the only path by\r\nwhich a burro can ascend the mesa, and which is still called "El Camino\r\ndel Padre."\r\n\r\nThe more Father Latour examined this church, the more he was inclined to\r\nthink that Fray Ramirez, or some Spanish priest who followed him, was\r\nnot altogether innocent of worldly ambition, and that they built for\r\ntheir own satisfaction, perhaps, rather than according to the needs of\r\nthe Indians. The magnificent site, the natural grandeur of this\r\nstronghold, might well have turned their heads a little. Powerful men\r\nthey must have been, those Spanish Fathers, to draft Indian labour for\r\nthis great work without military support. Every stone in that structure,\r\nevery handful of earth in those many thousand pounds of adobe, was\r\ncarried up the trail on the backs of men and boys and women. And the\r\ngreat carved beams of the roof--Father Latour looked at them with\r\namazement. In all the plain through which he had come he had seen no\r\ntrees but a few stunted pi\xc3\xb1ons. He asked Jacinto where these huge\r\ntimbers could have been found.\r\n\r\n"San Mateo mountain, I guess."\r\n\r\n"But the San Mateo mountains must be forty or fifty miles away. How\r\ncould they bring such timbers?"\r\n\r\nJacinto shrugged. "\xc3\x81comas carry." Certainly there was no other\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nBesides the church proper there was the cloister, large, thick-walled,\r\nwhich must have required an enormous labour of portage from the plain.\r\nThe deep cloister corridors were cool when the rock outside was\r\nblistering; the low arches opened on an enclosed garden which, judging\r\nfrom its depth of earth, must once have been very verdant. Pacing those\r\nshady passages, with four feet of solid, windowless adobe shutting out\r\neverything but the green garden and the turquoise sky above, the early\r\nmissionaries might well have forgotten the poor \xc3\x81comas, that tribe of\r\nancient rock-turtles, and believed themselves in some cloister hung on a\r\nspur of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nIn the grey dust of the enclosed garden two thin, half-dead peach trees\r\nstill struggled with the drouth, the kind of unlikely tree that grows up\r\nfrom an old root and never bears. By the wall yellow suckers put out\r\nfrom an old vine stump, very thick and hard, which must once have borne\r\nits ripe clusters.\r\n\r\nBuilt upon the north-east corner of the cloister the Bishop found a\r\nloggia--roofed, but with open sides, looking down on the white pueblo\r\nand the tawny rock, and over the wide plain below. There he decided he\r\nwould spend the night. From this loggia he watched the sun go down;\r\nwatched the desert become dark, the shadows creep upward. Abroad in the\r\nplain the scattered mesa tops, red with the afterglow, one by one lost\r\ntheir light, like candles going out. He was on a naked rock in the\r\ndesert, in the stone age, a prey to homesickness for his own kind, his\r\nown epoch, for European man and his glorious history of desire and\r\ndreams. Through all the centuries that his own part of the world had\r\nbeen changing like the sky at day-break, this people had been fixed,\r\nincreasing neither in numbers nor desires, rock-turtles on their rock.\r\nSomething reptilian he felt here, something that had endured by\r\nimmobility, a kind of life out of reach, like the crustaceans in their\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nOn his homeward way the Bishop spent another night with Father Jesus,\r\nthe good priest at Isleta, who talked with him much of the Moqui country\r\nand of those very old rock-set pueblos still farther to the west. One\r\nstory related to a long-forgotten friar at \xc3\x81coma, and was somewhat as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF FRAY BALTAZAR\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME time in the very early years of seventeen hundred, nearly fifty\r\nyears after the great Indian uprising in which all the missionaries and\r\nall the Spaniards in northern New Mexico were either driven out or\r\nmurdered, after the country had been reconquered and new missionaries\r\nhad come to take the place of the martyrs, a certain Friar Baltazar\r\nMontoya was priest at \xc3\x81coma. He was of a tyrannical and overbearing\r\ndisposition and bore a hard hand on the natives. All the missions now in\r\nruins were active then, each had its resident priest, who lived for the\r\npeople or upon the people, according to his nature. Friar Baltazar was\r\none of the most ambitious and exacting. It was his belief that the\r\npueblo of \xc3\x81coma existed chiefly to support its fine church, and that\r\nthis should be the pride of the Indians as it was his. He took the best\r\nof their corn and beans and squashes for his table, and selected the\r\nchoicest portions when they slaughtered a sheep, chose their best hides\r\nto carpet his dwelling. Moreover, he exacted a heavy tribute in labour.\r\nHe was never done with having earth carried up from the plain in\r\nbaskets. He enlarged the churchyard and made the deep garden in the\r\ncloister, enriching it with dung from the corrals. Here he was able to\r\ngrow a wonderful garden, since it was watered every evening by\r\nwomen,--and this despite the fact that it was not proper that a woman\r\nshould ever enter the cloister at all. Each woman owed the Padre so many\r\n_ollas_ of water a week from the cisterns, and they murmured not only\r\nbecause of the labour, but because of the drain on their water-supply.\r\n\r\nBaltazar was not a lazy man, and in his first years there, before he\r\nbecame stout, he made long journeys in behalf of his mission and his\r\ngarden. He went as far as Oraibi, many days\' journey, to select their\r\nbest peach seeds. (The peach orchards of Oraibi were very old, having\r\nbeen cultivated since the days of the earliest Spanish expeditions, when\r\nCoronado\'s captains gave the Moquis peach seeds brought from Spain.) His\r\ngrape cuttings were brought from Sonora in baskets on muleback, and he\r\nwould go all the way to the Villa (Santa F\xc3\xa9) for choice garden seeds,\r\nat the season when pack trains came up the Rio Grande valley. The early\r\nchurchmen did a great business in carrying seeds about, though the\r\nIndians and Mexicans were satisfied with beans and squashes and chili,\r\nasking nothing more.\r\n\r\nFriar Baltazar was from a religious house in Spain which was noted for\r\ngood living, and he himself had worked in the refectory. He was an\r\nexcellent cook and something of a carpenter, and he took a great deal of\r\ntrouble to make himself comfortable upon that rock at the end of the\r\nworld. He drafted two Indian boys into his service, one to care for his\r\nass and work in the garden, the other to cook and wait upon him at\r\ntable. In time, as he grew more unwieldy in figure, he adopted a third\r\nboy and employed him as a runner to the distant missions. This boy would\r\ngo on foot all the way to the Villa for red cloth or an iron spade or a\r\nnew knife, stopping at Bernalillo to bring home a wineskin full of grape\r\nbrandy. He would go five days\' journey to the Sandia mountains to catch\r\nfish and dry or salt them for the Padre\'s fast-days, or run to Zu\xc3\xb1i,\r\nwhere the Fathers raised rabbits, and bring back a pair for the spit.\r\nHis errands were seldom of an ecclesiastical nature.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the Friar at \xc3\x81coma lived more after the flesh than\r\nafter the spirit. The difficulty of obtaining an interesting and varied\r\ndiet on a naked rock seemed only to whet his appetite and tempt his\r\nresourcefulness. But his sensuality went no further than his garden and\r\ntable. Carnal commerce with the Indian women would have been very easy\r\nindeed, and the Friar was at the hardy age of ripe manhood when such\r\ntemptations are peculiarly sharp. But the missionaries had early\r\ndiscovered that the slightest departure from chastity greatly weakened\r\ntheir influence and authority with their Indian converts. The Indians\r\nthemselves sometimes practised continence as a penance, or as a strong\r\nmedicine with the spirits, and they were very willing that their Padre\r\nshould practise it for them. The consequences of carnal indulgence were\r\nperhaps more serious here than in Spain, and Friar Baltazar seems never\r\nto have given his flock an opportunity to exult over his frailty.\r\n\r\nHe held his seat at \xc3\x81coma for nearly fifteen prosperous years,\r\nconstantly improving his church and his living-quarters, growing new\r\nvegetables and medicinal herbs, making soap from the yucca root. Even\r\nafter he became stout, his arms were strong and muscular, his fingers\r\nclever. He cultivated his peach trees, and watched over his garden like\r\na little kingdom, never allowing the native women to grow slack in the\r\nwater-supply. His first serving-boys were released to marry, and others\r\nsucceeded them, who were even more minutely trained.\r\n\r\nBaltazar\'s tyranny grew little by little, and the \xc3\x81coma people were\r\nsometimes at the point of revolt. But they could not estimate just how\r\npowerful the Padre\'s magic might be and were afraid to put it to the\r\ntest. There was no doubt that the holy picture of St. Joseph had come to\r\nthem from the King of Spain by the request of this Padre, and that\r\npicture had been more effective in averting drouth than all the native\r\nrain-makers had been. Properly entreated and honoured, the painting had\r\nnever failed to produce rain. \xc3\x81coma had not lost its crops since Friar\r\nBaltazar first brought the picture to them, though at Laguna and Zu\xc3\xb1i\r\nthere had been drouths that compelled the people to live upon their\r\nfamine store,--an alarming extremity.\r\n\r\nThe Laguna Indians were constantly sending legations to \xc3\x81coma to\r\nnegotiate terms at which they could rent the holy picture, but Friar\r\nBaltazar had warned them never to let it go. If such powerful protection\r\nwere withdrawn, or if the Padre should turn the magic against them, the\r\nconsequences might be disastrous to the pueblo. Better give him his\r\nchoice of grain and lambs and pottery, and allow him his three\r\nserving-boys. So the missionary and his converts rubbed along in seeming\r\nfriendliness.\r\n\r\nOne summer the Friar, who did not make long journeys now that he had\r\ngrown large in girth, decided that he would like company,--someone to\r\nadmire his fine garden, his ingenious kitchen, his airy loggia with its\r\nrugs and water jars, where he meditated and took his after-dinner\r\nsiesta. So he planned to give a dinner party in the week after St.\r\nJohn\'s Day.\r\n\r\nHe sent his runner to Zu\xc3\xb1i, Laguna, Isleta, and bade the Padres to a\r\nfeast. They came upon the day, four of them, for there were two priests\r\nat Zu\xc3\xb1i. The stable-boy was stationed at the foot of the rock to take\r\ntheir beasts and conduct the visitors up the stairway. At the head of\r\nthe trail Baltazar received them. They were shown over the place, and\r\nspent the morning gossiping in the cloister walks, cool and silent,\r\nthough the naked rock outside was almost too hot for the hand to touch.\r\nThe vine leaves rustled agreeably in the breeze, and the earth about the\r\ncarrot and onion tops, as it dried from last night\'s watering, gave off\r\na pleasant smell. The guests thought their host lived very well, and\r\nthey wished they had his secret. If he was a trifle boastful of his\r\nair-bound seat, no one could blame him.\r\n\r\nWith the dinner, Baltazar had taken extravagant pains. The monastery in\r\nwhich he had learned to cook was off the main highway to Seville; the\r\nSpanish nobles and the King himself sometimes stopped there for\r\nentertainment. In that great kitchen, with its multiplicity of spits,\r\nsmall enough to roast a lark and large enough to roast a boar, the Friar\r\nhad learned a thing or two about sauces, and in his lonely years at\r\n\xc3\x81coma he had bettered his instruction by a natural aptitude for the\r\nart. The poverty of materials had proved an incentive rather than a\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\nCertainly the visiting missionaries had never sat down to food like that\r\nwhich rejoiced them to-day in the cool refectory, the blinds open just\r\nenough to admit a streak of throbbing desert far below them. Their host\r\nwas telling them pompously that he would have a fountain in the cloister\r\nclose when they came again. He had to check his hungry guests in their\r\nzeal for the relishes and the soup, warning them to save their mettle\r\nfor what was to come. The roast was to be a wild turkey, superbly\r\ndone--but that, alas, was never tasted. The course which preceded it was\r\nthe host\'s especial care, and here he had trusted nothing to his cook;\r\nhare _jardini\xc3\xa8re_ (his carrots and onions were tender and well\r\nflavoured), with a sauce which he had been perfecting for many years.\r\nThis entr\xc3\xa9e was brought from the kitchen in a large earthen dish--but\r\nnot large enough, for with its luxury of sauce and floating carrots it\r\nfilled the platter to the brim. The stable-boy was serving to-day, as\r\nthe cook could not leave his spits, and he had been neat, brisk, and\r\nefficient. The Friar was pleased with him, and was wondering whether he\r\ncould not find some little medal of bronze or silver-gilt to reward him\r\nfor his pains.\r\n\r\nWhen the hare in its sauce came on, the priest from Isleta chanced to be\r\ntelling a funny story at which the company were laughing uproariously.\r\nThe serving-boy, who knew a little Spanish, was apparently trying to get\r\nthe point of the recital which made the Padres so merry. At any rate, he\r\nbecame distracted, and as he passed behind the senior priest of Zu\xc3\xb1i,\r\nhe tipped his full platter and spilled a stream of rich brown gravy over\r\nthe good man\'s head and shoulders. Baltazar was quick-tempered, and he\r\nhad been drinking freely of the fiery grape brandy. He caught up the\r\nempty pewter mug at his right and threw it at the clumsy lad with a\r\nmalediction. It struck the boy on the side of the head. He dropped the\r\nplatter, staggered a few steps, and fell down. He did not get up, nor\r\ndid he move. The Padre from Zu\xc3\xb1i was skilled in medicine. Wiping the\r\nsauce from his eyes, he bent over the boy and examined him.\r\n\r\n"_Muerto_," he whispered. With that he plucked his junior priest by the\r\nsleeve, and the two bolted across the garden without another word and\r\nmade for the head of the stairway. In a moment the Padres of Laguna and\r\nIsleta unceremoniously followed their example. With remarkable speed the\r\nfour guests got them down from the rock, saddled their mules, and urged\r\nthem across the plain.\r\n\r\nBaltazar was left alone with the consequences of his haste.\r\nUnfortunately the cook, astonished at the prolonged silence, had looked\r\nin at the door just as the last pair of brown gowns were vanishing\r\nacross the cloister. He saw his comrade lying upon the floor, and\r\nsilently disappeared from the premises by an exit known only to himself.\r\n\r\nWhen Friar Baltazar went into the kitchen he found it solitary, the\r\nturkey still dripping on the spit. Certainly he had no appetite for the\r\nroast. He felt, indeed, very remorseful and uncomfortable, also\r\nindignant with his departed guests. For a moment he entertained the idea\r\nof following them; but a temporary flight would only weaken his\r\nposition, and a permanent evacuation was not to be thought of. His\r\ngarden was at its prime, his peaches were just coming ripe, and his\r\nvines hung heavy with green clusters. Mechanically he took the turkey\r\nfrom the spit, not because he felt any inclination for food, but from an\r\ninstinct of compassion, quite as if the bird could suffer from being\r\nburned to a crisp. This done, he repaired to his loggia and sat down to\r\nread his breviary, which he had neglected for several days, having been\r\nso occupied in the refectory. He had begrudged no pains to that sauce\r\nwhich had been his undoing.\r\n\r\nThe airy loggia, where he customarily took his afternoon repose, was\r\nlike a birdcage hung in the breeze. Through its open archways he looked\r\ndown on the huddled pueblo, and out over the great mesa-strewn plain far\r\nbelow. He was unable to fix his mind upon his office. The pueblo down\r\nthere was much too quiet. At this hour there should be a few women\r\nwashing pots or rags, a few children playing by the cisterns and chasing\r\nthe turkeys. But to-day the rock top baked in the fire of the sun in\r\nutter silence, not one human being was visible--yes, one, though he had\r\nnot been there a moment ago. At the head of the stone stairway, there\r\nwas a patch of lustrous black, just above the rocks; an Indian\'s hair.\r\nThey had set a guard at the trail head.\r\n\r\nNow the Padre began to feel alarmed, to wish he had gone down that\r\nstairway with the others, while there was yet time. He wished he were\r\nanywhere in the world but on this rock. There was old Father Ramirez\'s\r\ndonkey path; but if the Indians were watching one road, they would watch\r\nthe other. The spot of black hair never stirred; and there were but\r\nthose two ways down to the plain, only those ... Whichever way one\r\nturned, three hundred and fifty feet of naked cliff, without one tree or\r\nshrub a man could cling to.\r\n\r\nAs the sun sank lower and lower, there began a deep, singing murmur of\r\nmale voices from the pueblo below him, not a chant, but the rhythmical\r\nintonation of Indian oratory when a serious matter is under discussion.\r\nFrightful stories of the torture of the missionaries in the great\r\nrebellion of 1680 flashed into Friar Baltazar\'s mind; how one Franciscan\r\nhad his eyes torn out, another had been burned, and the old Padre at\r\nJamez had been stripped naked and driven on all fours about the plaza\r\nall night, with drunken Indians straddling his back, until he rolled\r\nover dead from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nMoonrise from the loggia was an impressive sight, even to this Brother\r\nwho was not over-impressionable. But to-night he wished he could keep\r\nthe moon from coming up through the floor of the desert,--the moon was\r\nthe clock which began things in the pueblo. He watched with horror for\r\nthat golden rim against the deep blue velvet of the night.\r\n\r\nThe moon came, and at its coming the \xc3\x81coma people issued from their\r\ndoors. A company of men walked silently across the rock to the cloister.\r\nThey came up the ladder and appeared in the loggia. The Friar asked them\r\ngruffly what they wanted, but they made no reply. Not once speaking to\r\nhim or to each other, they bound his feet together and tied his arms to\r\nhis sides.\r\n\r\nThe \xc3\x81coma people told afterwards that he did not supplicate or\r\nstruggle; had he done so, they might have dealt more cruelly with him.\r\nBut he knew his Indians, and that when once they had collectively made\r\nup their pueblo mind ... Moreover, he was a proud old Spaniard, and had\r\na certain fortitude lodged in his well-nourished body. He was accustomed\r\nto command, not to entreat, and he retained the respect of his Indian\r\nvassals to the end.\r\n\r\nThey carried him down the ladder and through the cloister and across the\r\nrock to the most precipitous cliff--the one over which the \xc3\x81coma women\r\nflung broken pots and such refuse as the turkeys would not eat. There\r\nthe people were assembled. They cut his bonds, and taking him by the\r\nhands and feet, swung him out over the rock-edge and back a few times.\r\nHe was heavy, and perhaps they thought this dangerous sport. No sound\r\nbut hissing breath came through his teeth. The four executioners took\r\nhim up again from the brink where they had laid him, and, after a few\r\nfeints, dropped him in mid-air.\r\n\r\nSo did they rid their rock of their tyrant, whom on the whole they had\r\nliked very well. But everything has its day. The execution was not\r\nfollowed by any sacrilege to the church or defiling of holy vessels, but\r\nmerely by a division of the Padre\'s stores and household goods. The\r\nwomen, indeed, took pleasure in watching the garden pine and waste away\r\nfrom thirst, and ventured into the cloisters to laugh and chatter at the\r\nwhitening foliage of the peach trees, and the green grapes shrivelling\r\non the vines.\r\n\r\nWhen the next priest came, years afterward, he found no ill will\r\nawaiting him. He was a native Mexican, of unpretentious tastes, who was\r\nwell satisfied with beans and jerked meat, and let the pueblo turkey\r\nflock scratch in the hot dust that had once been Baltazar\'s garden. The\r\nold peach stumps kept sending up pale sprouts for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FOUR\r\n\r\n_SNAKE ROOT_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT AT PECOS\r\n\r\n\r\nA MONTH after the Bishop\'s visit to Albuquerque and \xc3\x81coma, the genial\r\nFather Gallegos was formally suspended, and Father Vaillant himself took\r\ncharge of the parish. At first there was bitter feeling; the rich\r\n_rancheros_ and the merry ladies of Albuquerque were very hostile to the\r\nFrench priest. He began his reforms at once. Everything was changed. The\r\nholy-days, which had been occasions of revelry under Padre Gallegos,\r\nwere now days of austere devotion. The fickle Mexican population soon\r\nfound as much diversion in being devout as they had once found in being\r\nscandalous. Father Vaillant wrote to his sister Philom\xc3\xa8ne, in France,\r\nthat the temper of his parish was like that of a boys\' school; under one\r\nmaster the lads try to excel one another in mischief and disobedience,\r\nunder another they vie with each other in acts of loyalty. The Novena\r\npreceding Christmas, which had long been celebrated by dances and\r\nhilarious merry-making, was this year a great revival of religious zeal.\r\n\r\nThough Father Vaillant had all the duties of a parish priest at\r\nAlbuquerque, he was still Vicar General, and in February the Bishop\r\ndispatched him on urgent business to Las Vegas. He did not return on the\r\nday that he was expected, and when several days passed with no word from\r\nhim, Father Latour began to feel some anxiety.\r\n\r\nOne morning at day-break a very sick Indian boy rode into the Bishop\'s\r\ncourtyard on Father Joseph\'s white mule, Contento, bringing bad news.\r\nThe Padre, he said, had stopped at his village in the Pecos mountains\r\nwhere black measles had broken out, to give the sacrament to the dying,\r\nand had fallen ill of the sickness. The boy himself had been well when\r\nhe started for Santa F\xc3\xa9, but had become sick on the way.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had the messenger put into the wood-house, an isolated\r\nbuilding at the end of the garden, where the Sisters of Loretto could\r\ntend him. He instructed the Mother Superior to pack a bag with such\r\nmedicines and comforts for the sick as he could carry, and told\r\nFructosa, his cook, to put up for him the provisions he usually took on\r\nhorseback journeys. When his man brought a pack-mule and his own mule,\r\nAngelica, to the door, Father Latour, already in his rough\r\nriding-breeches and buckskin jacket, looked at the handsome beast and\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n"No, leave her with Contento. The new army mule is heavier, and will do\r\nfor this journey."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop rode out of Santa F\xc3\xa9 two hours after the Indian messenger\r\nrode in. He was going direct to the pueblo of Pecos, where he would pick\r\nup Jacinto. It was late in the afternoon when he reached the pueblo,\r\nlying low on its red rock ledges, half-surrounded by a crown of fir-clad\r\nmountains, and facing a sea of junipers and cedars. The Bishop had meant\r\nto get fresh horses at Pecos and push on through the mountains, but\r\nJacinto and the older Indians who gathered about the horseman, strongly\r\nadvised him to spend the night there and start in the early morning. The\r\nsun was shining brilliantly in a blue sky, but in the west, behind the\r\nmountain, lay a great stationary black cloud, opaque and motionless as a\r\nledge of rock. The old men looked at it and shook their heads.\r\n\r\n"Very big wind," said the governor gravely.\r\n\r\nUnwillingly the Bishop dismounted and gave his mules to Jacinto; it\r\nseemed to him that he was wasting time. There was still an hour before\r\nnightfall, and he spent that hour pacing up and down the crust of bare\r\nrock between the village and the ruin of the old mission church. The sun\r\nwas sinking, a red ball which threw a copper glow over the pine-covered\r\nridge of mountains, and edged that inky, ominous cloud with molten\r\nsilver. The great red earth walls of the mission, red as brick-dust,\r\nyawned gloomily before him,--part of the roof had fallen in, and the\r\nrest would soon go.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Father Joseph was lying dangerously ill in the dirt and\r\ndiscomfort of an Indian village in winter. Why, the Bishop was asking\r\nhimself, had he ever brought his friend to this life of hardship and\r\ndanger? Father Vaillant had been frail from childhood, though he had the\r\nendurance resulting from exhaustless enthusiasm. The Brothers at\r\nMontferrand were not given to coddling boys, but every year they used to\r\nsend this one away for a rest in the high Volvic mountains, because his\r\nvitality ran down under the confinement of college life. Twice, while he\r\nand Father Latour were missionaries in Ohio, Joseph had been at death\'s\r\ndoor; once so ill with cholera that the newspapers had printed his name\r\nin the death list. On that occasion their Ohio Bishop had christened him\r\n_Trompe-la-Mort_. Yes, Father Latour told himself, _Blanchet_ had\r\noutwitted death so often, there was always the chance he would do it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWalking about the walls of the ruin, the Bishop discovered that the\r\nsacristy was dry and clean, and he decided to spend the night there,\r\nwrapped in his blankets, on one of the earthen benches that ran about\r\nthe inner walls. While he was examining this room, the wind began to\r\nhowl about the old church, and darkness fell quickly. From the low\r\ndoorways of the pueblo ruddy fire-light was gleaming--singularly\r\ngrateful to the eye. Waiting for him on the rocks, he recognized the\r\nslight figure of Jacinto, his blanket drawn close about his head, his\r\nshoulders bowed to the wind.\r\n\r\nThe young Indian said that supper was ready, and the Bishop followed him\r\nto his particular lair in those rows of little houses all alike and all\r\nbuilt together. There was a ladder before Jacinto\'s door which led up to\r\na second storey, but that was the dwelling of another family; the roof\r\nof Jacinto\'s house made a veranda for the family above him. The Bishop\r\nbent his head under the low doorway and stepped down; the floor of the\r\nroom was a long step below the doorsill--the Indian way of preventing\r\ndrafts. The room into which he descended was long and narrow, smoothly\r\nwhitewashed, and clean, to the eye, at least, because of its very\r\nbareness. There was nothing on the walls but a few fox pelts and strings\r\nof gourds and red peppers. The richly coloured blankets of which Jacinto\r\nwas very proud were folded in piles on the earth settle,--it was there\r\nhe and his wife slept, near the fire-place. The earth of that settle\r\nbecame warm during the day and held its heat until morning, like the\r\nRussian peasants\' stove-bed. Over the fire a pot of beans and dried meat\r\nwas simmering. The burning pi\xc3\xb1on logs filled the room with\r\nsweet-smelling smoke. Clara, Jacinto\'s wife, smiled at the priest as he\r\nentered. She ladled out the stew, and the Bishop and Jacinto sat down on\r\nthe floor beside the fire, each with his bowl. Between them Clara put a\r\nbasin full of hot corn-bread baked with squash seeds,--an Indian\r\ndelicacy comparable to raisin bread among the whites. The Bishop said a\r\nblessing and broke the bread with his hands. While the two men ate, the\r\nyoung woman watched them and stirred a tiny cradle of deerskin which\r\nhung by thongs from the roof poles. Jacinto, when questioned, said sadly\r\nthat the baby was ailing. Father Latour did not ask to see it; it would\r\nbe swathed in layers of wrappings, he knew; even its face and head would\r\nbe covered against drafts. Indian babies were never bathed in winter,\r\nand it was useless to suggest treatment for the sick ones. On that\r\nsubject the Indian ear was closed to advice.\r\n\r\nIt was a pity, too, that he could do nothing for Jacinto\'s baby. Cradles\r\nwere not many in the pueblo of Pecos. The tribe was dying out; infant\r\nmortality was heavy, and the young couples did not reproduce\r\nfreely,--the life-force seemed low. Smallpox and measles had taken heavy\r\ntoll here time and again.\r\n\r\nOf course there were other explanations, credited by many good people in\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9. Pecos had more than its share of dark legends,--perhaps that\r\nwas because it had been too tempting to white men, and had had more than\r\nits share of history. It was said that this people had from time\r\nimmemorial kept a ceremonial fire burning in some cave in the mountain,\r\na fire that had never been allowed to go out, and had never been\r\nrevealed to white men. The story was that the service of this fire\r\nsapped the strength of the young men appointed to serve it,--always the\r\nbest of the tribe. Father Latour thought this hardly probable. Why\r\nshould it be very arduous, in a mountain full of timber, to feed a fire\r\nso small that its whereabouts had been concealed for centuries?\r\n\r\nThere was also the snake story, reported by the early explorers, both\r\nSpanish and American, and believed ever since: that this tribe was\r\npeculiarly addicted to snake worship, that they kept rattlesnakes\r\nconcealed in their houses, and somewhere in the mountain guarded an\r\nenormous serpent which they brought to the pueblo for certain feasts. It\r\nwas said that they sacrificed young babies to the great snake, and thus\r\ndiminished their numbers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed much more likely that the contagious diseases brought by white\r\nmen were the real cause of the shrinkage of the tribe. Among the\r\nIndians, measles, scarlatina and whooping-cough were as deadly as typhus\r\nor cholera. Certainly, the tribe was decreasing every year. Jacinto\'s\r\nhouse was at one end of the living pueblo; behind it were long rock\r\nridges of dead pueblo,--empty houses ruined by weather and now scarcely\r\nmore than piles of earth and stone. The population of the living streets\r\nwas less than one hundred adults.[1] This was all that was left of the\r\nrich and populous Cicuy\xc3\xa8 of Coronado\'s expedition. Then, by his report,\r\nthere were six thousand souls in the Indian town. They had rich fields\r\nirrigated from the Pecos River. The streams were full of fish, the\r\nmountain was full of game. The pueblo, indeed, seemed to lie upon the\r\nknees of these verdant mountains, like a favoured child. Out yonder, on\r\nthe juniper-spotted plateau in front of the village, the Spaniards had\r\ncamped, exacting a heavy tribute of corn and furs and cotton garments\r\nfrom their hapless hosts. It was from here, the story went, that they\r\nset forth in the spring on their ill-fated search for the seven golden\r\ncities of Quivera, taking with them slaves and concubines ravished from\r\nthe Pecos people.\r\n\r\nAs Father Latour sat by the fire and listened to the wind sweeping down\r\nfrom the mountains and howling over the plateau, he thought of these\r\nthings; and he could not help wondering whether Jacinto, sitting silent\r\nby the same fire, was thinking of them, too. The wind, he knew, was\r\nblowing out of the inky cloud bank that lay behind the mountain at\r\nsunset; but it might well be blowing out of a remote, black past. The\r\nonly human voice raised against it was the feeble wailing of the sick\r\nchild in the cradle. Clara ate noiselessly in a corner, Jacinto looked\r\ninto the fire.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop read his breviary by the fire-light for an hour. Then, warmed\r\nto the bone and assured that his roll of blankets was warmed through, he\r\nrose to go. Jacinto followed with the blankets and one of his own\r\nbuffalo robes. They went along a line of red doorways and across the\r\nbare rock to the gaunt ruin, whose lateral walls, with their buttresses,\r\nstill braved the storm and let in the starlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _In actual fact, the dying pueblo of Pecos was abandoned\r\nsome years before the American occupation of New Mexico._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nSTONE LIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was not difficult for the Bishop to waken early. After midnight his\r\nbody became more and more chilled and cramped. He said his prayers\r\nbefore he rolled out of his blankets, remembering Father Vaillant\'s\r\nmaxim that if you said your prayers first, you would find plenty of time\r\nfor other things afterward.\r\n\r\nGoing through the silent pueblo to Jacinto\'s door, the Bishop woke him\r\nand asked him to make a fire. While the Indian went to get the mules\r\nready, Father Latour got his coffee-pot and tin cup out of his\r\nsaddle-bags, and a round loaf of Mexican bread. With bread and black\r\ncoffee, he could travel day after day. Jacinto was for starting without\r\nbreakfast, but Father Latour made him sit down and share his loaf. Bread\r\nis never too plenty in Indian households. Clara was still lying on the\r\nsettle with her baby.\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock they were on the road, Jacinto riding the mule that\r\ncarried the blankets. He knew the trails through his own mountains well\r\nenough to follow them in the dark. Toward noon the Bishop suggested a\r\nhalt to rest the mules, but his guide looked at the sky and shook his\r\nhead. The sun was nowhere to be seen, the air was thick and grey and\r\nsmelled of snow. Very soon the snow began to fall--lightly at first, but\r\nall the while becoming heavier. The vista of pine trees ahead of them\r\ngrew shorter and shorter through the vast powdering of descending\r\nflakes. A little after midday a burst of wind sent the snow whirling in\r\ncoils about the two travellers, and a great storm broke. The wind was\r\nlike a hurricane at sea, and the air became blind with snow. The Bishop\r\ncould scarcely see his guide--saw only parts of him, now a head, now a\r\nshoulder, now only the black rump of his mule. Pine trees by the way\r\nstood out for a moment, then disappeared absolutely in the whirlpool of\r\nsnow. Trail and landmarks, the mountain itself, were obliterated.\r\n\r\nJacinto sprang from his mule and unstrapped the roll of blankets.\r\nThrowing the saddle-bags to the Bishop, he shouted, "Come, I know a\r\nplace. Be quick, Padre."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop protested they could not leave the mules. Jacinto said the\r\nmules must take their chance.\r\n\r\nFor Father Latour the next hour was a test of endurance. He was blind\r\nand breathless, panting through his open mouth. He clambered over\r\nhalf-visible rocks, fell over prostrate trees, sank into deep holes and\r\nstruggled out, always following the red blankets on the shoulders of the\r\nIndian boy, which stuck out when the boy himself was lost to sight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the snow seemed thinner. The guide stopped short. They were\r\nstanding, the Bishop made out, under an overhanging wall of rock which\r\nmade a barrier against the storm. Jacinto dropped the blankets from his\r\nshoulder and seemed to be preparing to climb the cliff. Looking up, the\r\nBishop saw a peculiar formation in the rocks; two rounded ledges, one\r\ndirectly over the other, with a mouth-like opening between. They\r\nsuggested two great stone lips, slightly parted and thrust outward. Up\r\nto this mouth Jacinto climbed quickly by footholds well known to him.\r\nHaving mounted, he lay down on the lower lip, and helped the Bishop to\r\nclamber up. He told Father Latour to wait for him on this projection\r\nwhile he brought up the baggage.\r\n\r\nA few moments later the Bishop slid after Jacinto and the blankets,\r\nthrough the orifice, into the throat of the cave. Within stood a wooden\r\nladder, like that used in kivas, and down this he easily made his way to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a lofty cavern, shaped somewhat like a Gothic\r\nchapel, of vague outline,--the only light within was that which came\r\nthrough the narrow aperture between the stone lips. Great as was his\r\nneed of shelter, the Bishop, on his way down the ladder, was struck by a\r\nreluctance, an extreme distaste for the place. The air in the cave was\r\nglacial, penetrated to the very bones, and he detected at once a fetid\r\nodour, not very strong but highly disagreeable. Some twenty feet or so\r\nabove his head the open mouth let in grey daylight like a high transom.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood gazing about, trying to reckon the size of the cave, his\r\nguide was intensely preoccupied in making a careful examination of the\r\nfloor and walls. At the foot of the ladder lay a heap of half-burned\r\nlogs. There had been a fire there, and it had been extinguished with\r\nfresh earth,--a pile of dust covered what had been the heart of the\r\nfire. Against the cavern wall was a heap of pi\xc3\xb1on faggots, neatly\r\npiled. After he had made a minute examination of the floor, the guide\r\nbegan cautiously to move this pile of wood, taking the sticks up one by\r\none, and putting them in another spot. The Bishop supposed he would make\r\na fire at once, but he seemed in no haste to do so. Indeed, when he had\r\nmoved the wood he sat down upon the floor and fell into reflection.\r\nFather Latour urged him to build a fire without further delay.\r\n\r\n"Padre," said the Indian boy, "I do not know if it was right to bring\r\nyou here. This place is used by my people for ceremonies and is known\r\nonly to us. When you go out from here, you must forget."\r\n\r\n"I will forget, certainly. But unless we can have a fire, we had better\r\ngo back into the storm. I feel ill here already."\r\n\r\nJacinto unrolled the blankets and threw the dryest one about the\r\nshivering priest. Then he bent over the pile of ashes and charred wood,\r\nbut what he did was to select a number of small stones that had been\r\nused to fence in the burning embers. These he gathered in his _serape_ and\r\ncarried to the rear wall of the cavern, where, a little above his head,\r\nthere seemed to be a hole. It was about as large as a very big\r\nwatermelon, of an irregular oval shape.\r\n\r\nHoles of that shape are common in the black volcanic cliffs of the\r\nPajarito Plateau, where they occur in great numbers. This one was\r\nsolitary, dark, and seemed to lead into another cavern. Though it lay\r\nhigher than Jacinto\'s head, it was not beyond easy reach of his arms,\r\nand to the Bishop\'s astonishment he began deftly and noiselessly to\r\nplace the stones he had collected within the mouth of this orifice,\r\nfitting them together until he had entirely closed it. He then cut\r\nwedges from the pi\xc3\xb1on faggots and inserted them into the cracks between\r\nthe stones. Finally, he took a handful of the earth that had been used\r\nto smother the dead fire, and mixed it with the wet snow that had blown\r\nin between the stone lips. With this thick mud he plastered over his\r\nmasonry, and smoothed it with his palm. The whole operation did not take\r\na quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nWithout comment or explanation he then proceeded to build a fire. The\r\nodour so disagreeable to the Bishop soon vanished before the fragrance\r\nof the burning logs. The heat seemed to purify the rank air at the same\r\ntime that it took away the deathly chill, but the dizzy noise in Father\r\nLatour\'s head persisted. At first he thought it was a vertigo, a roaring\r\nin his ears brought on by cold and changes in his circulation. But as he\r\ngrew warm and relaxed, he perceived an extraordinary vibration in this\r\ncavern; it hummed like a hive of bees, like a heavy roll of distant\r\ndrums. After a time he asked Jacinto whether he, too, noticed this. The\r\nslim Indian boy smiled for the first time since they had entered the\r\ncave. He took up a faggot for a torch, and beckoned the Padre to follow\r\nhim along a tunnel which ran back into the mountain, where the roof grew\r\nmuch lower, almost within reach of the hand. There Jacinto knelt down\r\nover a fissure in the stone floor, like a crack in china, which was\r\nplastered up with clay. Digging some of this out with his hunting knife,\r\nhe put his ear on the opening, listened a few seconds, and motioned the\r\nBishop to do likewise.\r\n\r\nFather Latour lay with his ear to this crack for a long while, despite\r\nthe cold that arose from it. He told himself he was listening to one of\r\nthe oldest voices of the earth. What he heard was the sound of a great\r\nunderground river, flowing through a resounding cavern. The water was\r\nfar, far below, perhaps as deep as the foot of the mountain, a flood\r\nmoving in utter blackness under ribs of antediluvian rock. It was not a\r\nrushing noise, but the sound of a great flood moving with majesty and\r\npower.\r\n\r\n"It is terrible," he said at last, as he rose.\r\n\r\n"_Si, Padre_." Jacinto began spitting on the clay he had gouged out of\r\nthe seam, and plastered it up again.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to the fire, the patch of daylight up between the two\r\nlips had grown much paler. The Bishop saw it die with regret. He took\r\nfrom his saddle-bags his coffee-pot and a loaf of bread and a goat\r\ncheese. Jacinto climbed up to the lower ledge of the entrance, shook a\r\npine tree, and filled the coffee-pot and one of the blankets with fresh\r\nsnow. While his guide was thus engaged, the Bishop took a swallow of old\r\nTaos whisky from his pocket flask. He never liked to drink spirits in\r\nthe presence of an Indian.\r\n\r\nJacinto declared that he thought himself lucky to get bread and black\r\ncoffee. As he handed the Bishop back his tin cup after drinking its\r\ncontents, he rubbed his hand over his wide sash with a smile of pleasure\r\nthat showed all his white teeth.\r\n\r\n"We had good luck to be near here," he said. "When we leave the mules, I\r\nthink I can find my way here, but I am not sure. I have not been here\r\nvery many times. You was scare, Padre?"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop reflected. "You hardly gave me time to be scared, boy. Were\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nThe Indian shrugged his shoulders. "I think not to return to pueblo," he\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nFather Latour read his breviary long by the light of the fire. Since\r\nearly morning his mind had been on other than spiritual things. At last\r\nhe felt that he could sleep. He made Jacinto repeat a _Pater Noster_\r\nwith him, as he always did on their night camps, rolled himself in his\r\nblankets, and stretched out, feet to the fire. He had it in his mind,\r\nhowever, to waken in the night and study a little the curious hole his\r\nguide had so carefully closed. After he put on the mud, Jacinto had\r\nnever looked in the direction of that hole again, and Father Latour,\r\nobserving Indian good manners, had tried not to glance toward it.\r\n\r\nHe did waken, and the fire was still giving off a rich glow of light in\r\nthat lofty Gothic chamber. But there against the wall was his guide,\r\nstanding on some invisible foothold, his arms outstretched against the\r\nrock, his body flattened against it, his ear over that patch of fresh\r\nmud, listening; listening with supersensual ear, it seemed, and he\r\nlooked to be supported against the rock by the intensity of his\r\nsolicitude. The Bishop closed his eyes without making a sound and\r\nwondered why he had supposed he could catch his guide asleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they crawled out through the stone lips, and dropped\r\ninto a gleaming white world. The snow-clad mountains were red in the\r\nrising sun. The Bishop stood looking down over ridge after ridge of\r\nwintry fir trees with the tender morning breaking over them, all their\r\nbranches laden with soft, rose-coloured clouds of virgin snow.\r\n\r\nJacinto said it would not be worth while to look for the mules. When the\r\nsnow melted, he would recover the saddles and bridles. They floundered\r\non foot some eight miles to a squatter\'s cabin, rented horses, and\r\ncompleted their journey by starlight. When they reached Father Vaillant,\r\nhe was sitting up in a bed of buffalo skins, his fever broken, already\r\non the way to recovery. Another good friend had reached him before the\r\nBishop. Kit Carson, on a deer hunt in the mountains with two Taos\r\nIndians, had heard that this village was stricken and that the Vicario\r\nwas there. He hurried to the rescue, and got into the pueblo with a pack\r\nof venison meat just before the storm broke. As soon as Father Vaillant\r\ncould sit in the saddle, Carson and the Bishop took him back to Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9, breaking the journey into four days because of his enfeebled state.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop kept his word, and never spoke of Jacinto\'s cave to anyone,\r\nbut he did not cease from wondering about it. It flashed into his mind\r\nfrom time to time, and always with a shudder of repugnance quite\r\nunjustified by anything he had experienced there. It had been a\r\nhospitable shelter to him in his extremity. Yet afterward he remembered\r\nthe storm itself, even his exhaustion, with a tingling sense of\r\npleasure. But the cave, which had probably saved his life, he remembered\r\nwith horror. No tales of wonder, he told himself, would ever tempt him\r\ninto a cavern hereafter.\r\n\r\nAt home again, in his own house, he still felt a certain curiosity about\r\nthis ceremonial cave, and Jacinto\'s puzzling behaviour. It seemed almost\r\nto lend a colour of probability to some of those unpleasant stories\r\nabout the Pecos religion. He was already convinced that neither the\r\nwhite men nor the Mexicans in Santa F\xc3\xa9 understood anything about Indian\r\nbeliefs or the workings of the Indian mind.\r\n\r\nKit Carson had told him that the proprietor of the trading post between\r\nGlorieta Pass and the Pecos pueblo had grown up a neighbour to these\r\nIndians, and knew as much about them as anybody. His parents had kept\r\nthe trading post before him, and his mother was the first white woman in\r\nthat neighborhood. The trader\'s name was Zeb Orchard; he lived alone in\r\nthe mountains, selling salt and sugar and whisky and tobacco to red men\r\nand white. Carson said that he was honest and truthful, a good friend to\r\nthe Indians, and had at one time wanted to marry a Pecos girl, but his\r\nold mother, who was very proud of being "white," would not hear to it,\r\nand so he had remained a single man and a recluse.\r\n\r\nFather Latour made a point of stopping for the night with this trader on\r\none of his missionary journeys, in order to question him about the Pecos\r\ncustoms and ceremonies.\r\n\r\nOrchard said that the legend about the undying fire was unquestionably\r\ntrue; but it was kept burning, not in the mountain, but in their own\r\npueblo. It was a smothered fire in a clay oven, and had been burning in\r\none of the kivas ever since the pueblo was founded, centuries ago. About\r\nthe snake stories, he was not certain. He had seen rattlesnakes around\r\nthe pueblo, to be sure, but there were rattlers everywhere. A Pecos boy\r\nhad been bitten on the ankle some years ago, and had come to him-for\r\nwhisky; he swelled up and was very sick, like any other boy.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop asked Orchard if he thought it probable that the Indians kept\r\na great serpent in concealment somewhere, as was commonly reported.\r\n\r\n"They do keep some sort of varmint out in the mountain, that they bring\r\nin for their religious ceremonies," the trader said. "But I don\'t know\r\nif it\'s a snake or not. No white man knows anything about Indian\r\nreligion, Padre."\r\n\r\nAs they talked further, Orchard admitted that when he was a boy he had\r\nbeen very curious about these snake stories himself, and once, at their\r\nfestival time, he had spied on the Pecos men, though that was not a very\r\nsafe thing to do. He had lain in ambush for two nights on the mountain,\r\nand he saw a party of Indians bringing in a chest by torchlight. It was\r\nabout the size of a woman\'s trunk, and it was heavy enough to bend the\r\nyoung aspen poles on which it was hung. "If I\'d seen white men bringing\r\nin a chest after dark," he observed, "I could have made a guess at what\r\nwas in it; money, or whisky, or fire-arms. But seeing it was Indians, I\r\ncan\'t say. It might have been only queer-shaped rocks their ancestors\r\nhad taken a notion to. The things they value most are worth nothing to\r\nus. They\'ve got their own superstitions, and their minds will go round\r\nand round in the same old ruts till Judgment Day."\r\n\r\nFather Latour remarked that their veneration for old customs was a\r\nquality he liked in the Indians, and that it played a great part in his\r\nown religion.\r\n\r\nThe trader told him he might make good Catholics among the Indians, but\r\nhe would never separate them from their own beliefs. "Their priests have\r\ntheir own kind of mysteries. I don\'t know how much of it is real and how\r\nmuch is made up. I remember something that happened when I was a little\r\nfellow. One night a Pecos girl, with her baby in her arms, ran into the\r\nkitchen here and begged my mother to hide her until after the festival,\r\nfor she\'d seen signs between the _caciques_, and was sure they were\r\ngoing to feed--her baby to the snake. Whether it was true or not, she\r\ncertainly believed it, poor thing, and Mother let her stay. It made a\r\ngreat impression on me at the time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIVE\r\n\r\n_PADRE MARTINEZ_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP LATOUR, with Jacinto, was riding through the mountains on his\r\nfirst official visit to Taos--after Albuquerque, the largest and richest\r\nparish in his diocese. Both the priest and people there were hostile to\r\nAmericans and jealous of interference. Any European, except a Spaniard,\r\nwas regarded as a gringo. The Bishop had let the parish alone, giving\r\ntheir animosity plenty of time to cool. With Carson\'s help he had\r\ninformed himself fully about conditions there, and about the powerful\r\nold priest, Antonio Jos\xc3\xa9 Martinez, who was ruler in temporal as well as\r\nin spiritual affairs. Indeed, before Father Latour\'s entrance upon the\r\nscene, Martinez had been dictator to all the parishes in northern New\r\nMexico, and the native priests at Santa F\xc3\xa9 were all of them under his\r\nthumb.\r\n\r\nIt was common talk that Padre Martinez had instigated the revolt of the\r\nTaos Indians five years ago, when Bent, the American Governor, and a\r\ndozen other white men were murdered and scalped. Seven of the Taos\r\nIndians had been tried before a military court and hanged for the\r\nmurder, but no attempt had been made to call the plotting priest to\r\naccount. Indeed, Padre Martinez had managed to profit considerably by\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who were sentenced to death had sent for their Padre and\r\nbegged him to get them out of the trouble he had got them into. Martinez\r\npromised to save their lives if they would deed him their lands, near\r\nthe pueblo. This they did, and after the conveyance was properly\r\nexecuted the Padre troubled himself no more about the matter, but went\r\nto pay a visit at his native town of Abiquiu. In his absence the seven\r\nIndians were hanged on the appointed day. Martinez now cultivated their\r\nfertile farms, which made him quite the richest man in the parish.\r\n\r\nFather Latour had had polite correspondence with Martinez, but had met\r\nhim only once, on that memorable occasion when the Padre had ridden up\r\nfrom Taos to strengthen the Santa F\xc3\xa9 clergy in their refusal to\r\nrecognize the new Bishop. But he could see him as if that were only\r\nyesterday,--the priest of Taos was not a man one would easily forget.\r\nOne could not have passed him on the street without feeling his great\r\nphysical force and his imperious will. Not much taller than the Bishop\r\nin reality, he gave the impression of being an enormous man. His broad\r\nhigh shoulders were like a bull buffalo\'s, his big head was set\r\ndefiantly on a thick neck, and the full-cheeked, richly coloured,\r\negg-shaped Spanish face--how vividly the Bishop remembered that face! It\r\nwas so unusual that he would be glad to see it again; a high, narrow\r\nforehead, brilliant yellow eyes set deep in strong arches, and full,\r\nflorid cheeks,--not blank areas of smooth flesh, as in Anglo-Saxon\r\nfaces, but full of muscular activity, as quick to change with feeling as\r\nany of his features. His mouth was the very assertion of violent,\r\nuncurbed passions and tyrannical self-will; the full lips thrust out and\r\ntaut, like the flesh of animals distended by fear or desire.\r\n\r\nFather Latour judged that the day of lawless personal power was almost\r\nover, even on the frontier, and this figure was to him already like\r\nsomething picturesque and impressive, but really impotent, left over\r\nfrom the past.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop and Jacinto left the mountains behind them, the trail dropped\r\nto a plain covered by clumps of very old sage-brush, with trunks as\r\nthick as a man\'s leg. Jacinto pointed out a cloud of dust moving rapidly\r\ntoward them,--a cavalcade of a hundred men or more, Indians and\r\nMexicans, come out to welcome their Bishop with shouting and musketry.\r\n\r\nAs the horsemen approached, Padre Martinez himself was easily\r\ndistinguishable--in buckskin breeches, high boots and silver spurs, a\r\nwide Mexican hat on his head, and a great black cape wound about his\r\nshoulders like a shepherd\'s plaid. He rode up to the Bishop and reining\r\nin his black gelding, uncovered his head in a broad salutation, while\r\nhis escort surrounded the churchmen and fired their muskets into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe two priests rode side by side into Los Ranchos de Taos, a little\r\ntown of yellow walls and winding streets and green orchards. The\r\ninhabitants were all gathered in the square before the church. When the\r\nBishop dismounted to enter the church, the women threw their shawls on\r\nthe dusty pathway for him to walk upon, and as he passed through the\r\nkneeling congregation, men and women snatched for his hand to kiss the\r\nEpiscopal ring. In his own country all this would have been highly\r\ndistasteful to Jean Marie Latour. Here, these demonstrations seemed a\r\npart of the high colour that was in landscape and gardens, in the\r\nflaming cactus and the gaudily decorated altars,--in the agonized\r\nChrists and dolorous Virgins and the very human figures of the saints.\r\nHe had already learned that with this people religion was necessarily\r\ntheatrical.\r\n\r\nFrom Los Ranchos the party rode quickly across the grey plain into Taos\r\nitself, to the priest\'s house, opposite the church, where a great throng\r\nhad collected. As the people sank on their knees, one boy, a gawky lad\r\nof ten or twelve, remained standing, his mouth open and his hat on his\r\nhead. Padre Martinez reached over the heads of several kneeling women,\r\nsnatched off the boy\'s cap, and cuffed him soundly about the ears. When\r\nFather Latour murmured in protest, the native priest said boldly:\r\n\r\n"He is my own son, Bishop, and it is time I taught him manners."\r\n\r\nSo this was to be the tune, the Bishop reflected. His well-schooled\r\ncountenance did not change a shadow as he received this challenge, and\r\nhe passed on into the Padre\'s house. They went at once into Martinez\'s\r\nstudy, where they found a young man lying on the floor, fast asleep. He\r\nwas a very large young man, very stout, lying on his back with his head\r\npillowed on a book, and as he breathed his bulk rose and fell amazingly.\r\nHe wore a Franciscan\'s brown gown, and his hair was clipped short. At\r\nsight of the sleeper, Padre Martinez broke into a laugh and gave him a\r\nno very gentle kick in the ribs. The fellow got to his feet in great\r\nconfusion, escaping through a door into the _patio_.\r\n\r\n"You there," the Padre called after him, "only young men who work hard\r\nat night want to sleep in the day! You must have been studying by\r\ncandlelight. I\'ll give you an examination in theology!" This was greeted\r\nby a titter of feminine laughter from the windows across the court,\r\nwhere the fugitive took refuge behind a washing hung out to dry. He bent\r\nhis tall, full figure and disappeared between a pair of wet sheets.\r\n\r\n"That was my student, Trinidad," said Martinez, "a nephew of my old\r\nfriend Father Lucero, at Arroyo Hondo. He\'s a monk, but we want him to\r\ntake orders. We sent him to the Seminary in Durango, but he was either\r\ntoo homesick or too stupid to learn anything, so I\'m teaching him here.\r\nWe shall make a priest of him one day."\r\n\r\nFather Latour was told to consider the house his own, but he had no wish\r\nto. The disorder was almost more than his fastidious taste could bear.\r\nThe Padre\'s study table was sprinkled with snuff, and piled so high with\r\nbooks that they almost hid the crucifix hanging behind it. Books were\r\nheaped on chairs and tables all over the house,--and the books and the\r\nfloors were deep in the dust of spring sand-storms. Father Martinez\'s\r\nboots and hats lay about in corners, his coats and cassocks were hung on\r\npegs and draped over pieces of furniture. Yet the place seemed overrun\r\nby serving-women, young and old,--and by large yellow cats with full\r\nsoft fur, of a special breed, apparently. They slept in the\r\nwindow-sills, lay on the well-curb in the _patio_; the boldest came,\r\ndirectly, to the supper-table, where their master fed them carelessly\r\nfrom his plate.\r\n\r\nWhen they sat down to supper, the host introduced to the Bishop the\r\ntall, stout young man with the protruding front, who had been asleep on\r\nthe floor. He said again that Trinidad Lucero was studying with him, and\r\nwas supposed to be his secretary,--adding that he spent most of his time\r\nhanging about the kitchen and hindering the girls at their work.\r\n\r\nThese remarks were made in the young man\'s presence, but did not\r\nembarrass him at all. His whole attention was fixed upon the mutton\r\nstew, which he began to devour with undue haste as soon as his plate was\r\nput before him. The Bishop observed later that Trinidad was treated very\r\nmuch like a poor relation or a servant. He was sent on errands, was told\r\nwithout ceremony to fetch the Padre\'s boots, to bring wood for the fire,\r\nto saddle his horse. Father Latour disliked his personality so much that\r\nhe could scarcely look at him. His fat face was irritatingly stupid, and\r\nhad the grey, oily look of soft cheeses. The corners of his mouth were\r\ndeep folds in plumpness, like the creases in a baby\'s legs, and the\r\nsteel rim of his spectacles, where it crossed his nose, was embedded in\r\nsoft flesh. He said not one word during supper, but ate as if he were\r\nafraid of never seeing food again. When his attention left his plate for\r\na moment, it was fixed in the same greedy way upon the girl who served\r\nthe table--and who seemed to regard him with careless contempt. The\r\nstudent gave the impression of being always stupefied by one form of\r\nsensual disturbance or another.\r\n\r\nPadre Martinez, with a napkin tied round his neck to protect his\r\ncassock, ate and drank generously. The Bishop found the food poor\r\nenough, despite the many cooks, though the wine, which came from El Paso\r\ndel Norte, was very fair.\r\n\r\nDuring supper, his host asked the Bishop flatly if he considered\r\ncelibacy an essential condition of the priest\'s vocation.\r\n\r\nFather Latour replied merely that this question had been thrashed out\r\nmany centuries ago and decided once for all.\r\n\r\n"Nothing is decided once for all," Martinez declared fiercely. "Celibacy\r\nmay be all very well for the French clergy, but not for ours. St.\r\nAugustine himself says it is better not to go against nature. I find\r\nevery evidence that in his old age he regretted having practised\r\ncontinence."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop said he would be interested to see the passages from which he\r\ndrew such conclusions, observing that he knew the writings of St.\r\nAugustine fairly well.\r\n\r\n"I have the telling passages all written down somewhere. I will find\r\nthem before you go. You have probably read them with a sealed mind.\r\nCelibate priests lose their perceptions. No priest can experience\r\nrepentance and forgiveness of sin unless he himself falls into sin.\r\nSince concupiscence is the most common form of temptation, it is better\r\nfor him to know something about it. The soul cannot be humbled by fasts\r\nand prayer; it must be broken by mortal sin to experience forgiveness of\r\nsin and rise to a state of grace. Otherwise, religion is nothing but\r\ndead logic."\r\n\r\n"This is a subject upon which we must confer later, and at some length,"\r\nsaid the Bishop quietly. "I shall reform these practices throughout my\r\ndiocese as rapidly as possible. I hope it will be but a short time until\r\nthere is not a priest left who does not keep all the vows he took when\r\nhe bound himself to the service of the altar."\r\n\r\nThe swarthy Padre laughed, and threw off the big cat which had mounted\r\nto his shoulder. "It will keep you busy, Bishop. Nature has got the\r\nstart of you here. But for all that, our native priests are more devout\r\nthan your French Jesuits. We have a living Church here, not a dead arm\r\nof the European Church. Our religion grew out of the soil, and has its\r\nown roots. We pay a filial respect to the person of the Holy Father, but\r\nRome has no authority here. We do not require aid from the Propaganda,\r\nand we resent its interference. The Church the Franciscan Fathers\r\nplanted here was cut off; this is the second growth, and is indigenous.\r\nOur people are the most devout left in the world. If you blast their\r\nfaith by European formalities, they will become infidels and\r\nprofligates."\r\n\r\nTo this eloquence the Bishop returned blandly that he had not come to\r\ndeprive the people of their religion, but that he would be compelled to\r\ndeprive some of the priests of their parishes if they did not change\r\ntheir way of life.\r\n\r\nFather Martinez filled his glass and replied with perfect good humour.\r\n"You cannot deprive me of mine, Bishop. Try it! I will organize my own\r\nchurch. You can have your French priest of Taos, and I will have the\r\npeople!"\r\n\r\nWith this the Padre left the table and stood warming his back at the\r\nfire, his cassock pulled up about his waist to expose his trousers to\r\nthe blaze. "You are a young man, my Bishop," he went on, rolling his big\r\nhead back and looking up at the well-smoked roof poles. "And you know\r\nnothing about Indians or Mexicans. If you try to introduce European\r\ncivilization here and change our old ways, to interfere with the secret\r\ndances of the Indians, let us say, or abolish the bloody rites of the\r\nPenitentes, I foretell an early death for you. I advise you to study our\r\nnative traditions before you begin your reforms. You are among barbarous\r\npeople, my Frenchman, between two savage races. The dark things\r\nforbidden by your Church are a part of Indian religion. You cannot\r\nintroduce French fashions here."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the student, Trinidad, got up quietly, and after an\r\nobsequious bow to the Bishop, went with soft, escaping tread toward the\r\nkitchen. When his brown skirt had disappeared through the door, Father\r\nLatour turned sharply to his host.\r\n\r\n"Martinez, I consider it very unseemly to talk in this loose fashion\r\nbefore young men, especially a young man who is studying for the\r\npriesthood. Furthermore, I cannot see why a young man of this calibre\r\nshould be encouraged to take orders. He will never hold a parish in my\r\ndiocese."\r\n\r\nPadre Martinez laughed and showed his long, yellow teeth. Laughing did\r\nnot become him; his teeth were too large--distinctly vulgar. "Oh,\r\nTrinidad will go to Arroyo Hondo as curate to his uncle, who is growing\r\nold. He\'s a very devout fellow, Trinidad. You ought to see him in\r\nPassion Week. He goes up to Abiquiu and becomes another man; carries the\r\nheaviest crosses to the highest mountains, and takes more scourging than\r\nanyone. He comes back here with his back so full of cactus spines that\r\nthe girls have to pick him like a chicken."\r\n\r\nFather Latour was tired, and went to his room soon after supper. The\r\nbed, upon examination, seemed clean and comfortable, but he felt\r\nuncertain of its surroundings. He did not like the air of this house.\r\nAfter he retired, the clatter of dish-washing and the giggling of women\r\nacross the _patio_ kept him awake a long while; and when that ceased,\r\nFather Martinez began snoring in some chamber near by. He must have left\r\nhis door open into the _patio_, for the adobe partitions were thick\r\nenough to smother sound otherwise. The Padre snored like an enraged\r\nbull, until the Bishop decided to go forth and find his door and close\r\nit. He arose, lit his candle, and opened his own door in half-hearted\r\nresolution. As the night wind blew into the room, a little dark shadow\r\nfluttered from the wall across the floor; a mouse, perhaps. But no, it\r\nwas a bunch of woman\'s hair that had been indolently tossed into a\r\ncorner when some slovenly female toilet was made in this room. This\r\ndiscovery annoyed the Bishop exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Mass was at eleven the next morning, the parish priest officiating\r\nand the Bishop in the Episcopal chair. He was well pleased with the\r\nchurch of Taos. The building was clean and in good repair, the\r\ncongregation large and devout. The delicate lace, snowy linen, and\r\nburnished brass on the altar told of a devoted Altar Guild. The boys who\r\nserved at the altar wore rich smocks of hand-made lace over their\r\nscarlet surplices. The Bishop had never heard the Mass more impressively\r\nsung than by Father Martinez. The man had a beautiful baritone voice,\r\nand he drew from some deep well of emotional power. Nothing in the\r\nservice was slighted, every phrase and gesture had its full value. At\r\nthe moment of the Elevation the dark priest seemed to give his whole\r\nforce, his swarthy body and all its blood, to that lifting-up. Rightly\r\nguided, the Bishop reflected, this Mexican might have been a great man.\r\nHe had an altogether compelling personality, a disturbing, mysterious\r\nmagnetic power.\r\n\r\nAfter the confirmation service, Father Martinez had horses brought round\r\nand took the Bishop out to see his farms and live-stock. He took him all\r\nover his ranches down in the rich bottom lands between Taos and the\r\nIndian pueblo which, as Father Latour knew, had come into his possession\r\nfrom the seven Indians who were hanged. Martinez referred carelessly to\r\nthe Bent massacre as they rode along. He boasted that there had never\r\nbeen trouble afoot in New Mexico that wasn\'t started in Taos.\r\n\r\nThey stopped just west of the pueblo a little before sunset,--a pueblo\r\nvery different from all the others the Bishop had visited; two large\r\ncommunal houses, shaped like pyramids, gold-coloured in the afternoon\r\nlight, with the purple mountain lying just behind them. Gold-coloured\r\nmen in white burnouses came out on the stairlike flights of roofs, and\r\nstood still as statues, apparently watching the changing light on the\r\nmountain. There was a religious silence over the place; no sound at all\r\nbut the bleating of goats coming home through clouds of golden dust.\r\n\r\nThese two houses, the Padre told him, had been continuously occupied by\r\nthis tribe for more than a thousand years. Coronado\'s men found them\r\nthere, and described them as a superior kind of Indian, handsome and\r\ndignified in bearing, dressed in deerskin coats and trousers like those\r\nof Europeans.\r\n\r\nThough the mountain was timbered, its lines were so sharp that it had\r\nthe sculptured look of naked mountains like the Sandias. The general\r\ngrowth on its sides was evergreen, but the canyons and ravines were\r\nwooded with aspens, so that the shape of every depression was painted on\r\nthe mountain-side, light green against the dark, like symbols;\r\nserpentine, crescent, half-circles. This mountain and its ravines had\r\nbeen the seat of old religious ceremonies, honey-combed with noiseless\r\nIndian life, the repository of Indian secrets, for many centuries, the\r\nPadre remarked.\r\n\r\n"And some place in there, you may be sure, they keep Pop\xc3\xa9\'s estufa, but\r\nno white man will ever see it. I mean the estufa where Pop\xc3\xa9 sealed\r\nhimself up for four years and never saw the light of day, when he was\r\nplanning the revolt of 1680. I suppose you know all about that outbreak,\r\nBishop Latour?"\r\n\r\n"Something, of course, from the Martyrology. But I did not know that it\r\noriginated in Taos."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I just told you that all the trouble there ever was in New\r\nMexico originated in Taos?" boasted the Padre. "Pop\xc3\xa9 was born a San\r\nJuan Indian, but so was Napoleon a Corsican. He operated from Taos."\r\n\r\nPadre Martinez knew his country, a country which had no written\r\nhistories. He gave the Bishop much the best account he had heard of the\r\ngreat Indian revolt of 1680, which added such a long chapter to the\r\nMartyrology of the New World, when all the Spaniards were killed or\r\ndriven out, and there was not one European left alive north of El Paso\r\ndel Norte.\r\n\r\nThat night after supper, as his host sat taking snuff, Father Latour\r\nquestioned him closely and learned something about the story of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMartinez was born directly under that solitary blue mountain on the\r\nsky-line west of Taos, shaped like a pyramid with the apex sliced off,\r\nin Abiquiu. It was one of the oldest Mexican settlements in the\r\nterritory, surrounded by canyons so deep and ranges so rugged that it\r\nwas practically cut off from intercourse with the outside world. Being\r\nso solitary, its people were sombre in temperament, fierce and fanatical\r\nin religion, celebrated the Passion Week by cross-bearings and bloody\r\nscourgings.\r\n\r\nAntonio Jos\xc3\xa9 Martinez grew up there, without learning to read or write,\r\nmarried at twenty, and lost his wife and child when he was twenty-three.\r\nAfter his marriage he had learned to read from the parish priest, and\r\nwhen he became a widower he decided to study for the priesthood. Taking\r\nhis clothes and the little money he got from the sale of his household\r\ngoods, he started on horseback for Durango, in Old Mexico. There he\r\nentered the Seminary and began a life of laborious study.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop could imagine what it meant for a young man who had not\r\nlearned to read until long after adolescence, to undergo a severe\r\nacademic training. He found Martinez deeply versed, not only in the\r\nChurch Fathers, but in the Latin and Spanish classics. After six years\r\nat the Seminary, Martinez had returned to his native Abiquiu as priest\r\nof the parish church there. He was passionately attached to that old\r\nvillage under the pyramidal mountain. All the while he had been in Taos,\r\nhalf a lifetime now, he made periodic pilgrimages on horseback back to\r\nAbiquiu, as if the flavour of his own yellow earth were medicine to his\r\nsoul. Naturally he hated the Americans. The American occupation meant\r\nthe end of men like himself. He was a man of the old order, a son of\r\nAbiquiu, and his day was over.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his departure from Taos, the Bishop went out of his way to make a\r\ncall at Kit Carson\'s ranch house. Carson, he knew, was away buying\r\nsheep, but Father Latour wished to see the Se\xc3\xb1ora Carson to thank her\r\nagain for her kindness to poor Magdalena, and to tell her of the woman\'s\r\nhappy and devoted life with the Sisters in their school at Santa F\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nThe Se\xc3\xb1ora received him with that quiet but unabashed hospitality which\r\nis a common grace in Mexican households. She was a tall woman, slender,\r\nwith drooping shoulders and lustrous black eyes and hair. Though she\r\ncould not read, both her face and conversation were intelligent. To the\r\nBishop\'s thinking, she was handsome; her countenance showed that\r\ndiscipline of life which he admired. She had a cheerful disposition,\r\ntoo, and a pleasant sense of humour. It was possible to talk\r\nconfidentially to her. She said she hoped he had been comfortable in\r\nPadre Martinez\'s house, with an inflection which told that she much\r\ndoubted it, and she laughed a little when he confessed that he had been\r\nannoyed by the presence of Trinidad Lucero.\r\n\r\n"Some people say he is Father Lucero\'s son," she said with a shrug. "But\r\nI do not think so. More likely one of Padre Martinez\'s. Did you hear\r\nwhat happened to him at Abiquiu last year, in Passion Week? He tried to\r\nbe like the Saviour, and had himself crucified. Oh, not with nails! He\r\nwas tied upon a cross with ropes, to hang there all night; they do that\r\nsometimes at Abiquiu, it is a very old-fashioned place. But he is so\r\nheavy that after he had hung there a few hours, the cross fell over with\r\nhim, and he was very much humiliated. Then he had himself tied to a post\r\nand said he would bear as many stripes as our Saviour--six thousand, as\r\nwas revealed to St. Bridget. But before they had given him a hundred, he\r\nfainted. They scourged him with cactus whips, and his back was so\r\npoisoned that he was sick up there for a long while. This year they sent\r\nword that they did not want him at Abiquiu, so he had to keep Holy Week\r\nhere, and everybody laughed at him."\r\n\r\nFather Latour asked the Se\xc3\xb1ora to tell him frankly whether she thought\r\nhe could put a stop to the extravagances of the Penitential Brotherhood.\r\nShe smiled and shook her head. "I often say to my husband, I hope you\r\nwill not try to do that. It would only set the people against you. The\r\nold people have need of their old customs; and the young ones will go\r\nwith the times."\r\n\r\nAs the Bishop was taking his leave, she put into his saddle-bags a\r\nbeautiful piece of lace-work for Magdalena. "She will not be likely to\r\nuse it for herself, but she will be glad to have it to give to the\r\nSisters. That brutal man left her nothing. After he was hung, there was\r\nnothing to sell but his gun and one burro. That was why he was going to\r\ntake the risk of killing two Padres for their mules--and for spite\r\nagainst religion, maybe! Magdalena said he had often threatened to kill\r\nthe priest at Mora."\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Santa F\xc3\xa9 the Bishop found Father Vaillant awaiting him. They had not\r\nseen each other since Easter, and there were many things to be\r\ndiscussed. The vigour and zeal of Bishop Latour\'s administration had\r\nalready been recognized at Rome, and he had lately received a letter\r\nfrom Cardinal Fransoni, Prefect of the Propaganda, announcing that the\r\nvicarate of Santa F\xc3\xa9 had been formally raised to a diocese. By the same\r\nlong-delayed post came an invitation from the Cardinal, urgently\r\nrequesting Father Latour\'s presence at important conferences at the\r\nVatican during the following year. Though all these matters must be\r\ntaken up in their turn between the Bishop and his Vicar-General, Father\r\nJoseph had undoubtedly come up from Albuquerque at this particular time\r\nbecause of a lively curiosity to hear how the Bishop had been received\r\nin Taos.\r\n\r\nSeated in the study in their old cassocks, with the candles lighted on\r\nthe table between them, they spent a long evening.\r\n\r\n"For the present," Father Latour remarked, "I shall do nothing to change\r\nthe curious situation at Taos. It is not expedient to interfere. The\r\nchurch is strong, the people are devout. No matter what the conduct of\r\nthe priest has been, he has built up a strong organization, and his\r\npeople are devotedly loyal to him."\r\n\r\n"But can he be disciplined, do you think?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there is no question of discipline! He has been a little potentate\r\ntoo long. His people would assuredly support him against a French\r\nBishop. For the present I shall be blind to what I do not like there."\r\n\r\n"But Jean," Father Joseph broke out in agitation, "the man\'s life is an\r\nopen scandal, one hears of it everywhere. Only a few weeks ago I was\r\ntold a pitiful story of a Mexican girl carried off in one of the Indian\r\nraids on the Costella valley. She was a child of eight when she was\r\ncarried away, and was fifteen when she was found and ransomed. During\r\nall that time the pious girl had preserved her virginity by a succession\r\nof miracles. She had a medal from the shrine of Our Lady of Guadelupe\r\ntied round her neck, and she said such prayers as she had been taught.\r\nHer chastity was threatened many times, but always some unexpected event\r\naverted the catastrophe. After she was found and sent back to some\r\nrelatives living in Arroyo Hondo, she was so devout that she wished to\r\nbecome a religious. She was debauched by this Martinez, and he married\r\nher to one of his peons. She is now living on one of his farms."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Christobal told me that story," said the Bishop with a shrug. "But\r\nPadre Martinez is getting too old to play the part of Don Juan much\r\nlonger. I do not wish to lose the parish of Taos in order to punish its\r\npriest, my friend. I have no priest strong enough to put in his place.\r\nYou are the only man who could meet the situation there, and you are at\r\nAlbuquerque. A year from now I shall be in Rome, and there I hope to get\r\na Spanish missionary who will take over the parish of Taos. Only a\r\nSpaniard would be welcomed there, I think."\r\n\r\n"You are doubtless right," said Father Joseph. "I am often too hasty in\r\nmy judgments. I may do very badly for you while you are in Europe. For I\r\nsuppose I am to leave my dear Albuquerque, and come to Santa F\xc3\xa9 while\r\nyou are gone?"\r\n\r\n"Assuredly. They will love you all the more for lacking you awhile. I\r\nhope to bring some more hardy Auvergnats back with me, young men from\r\nour own Seminary, and I am afraid I must put one of them in Albuquerque.\r\nYou have been there long enough. You have done all that is necessary. I\r\nneed you here, Father Joseph. As it is now, one of us must ride seventy\r\nmiles whenever we wish to converse about anything."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant sighed. "Ah, I supposed it would come! You will snatch\r\nme from Albuquerque as you did from Sandusky. When I went there\r\neverybody was my enemy, now everybody is my friend; therefore it is time\r\nto go." Father Vaillant took off his glasses, folded them, and put them\r\nin their case, which act always announced his determination to retire.\r\n"So a year from now you will be in Rome. Well, I had rather be among my\r\npeople in Albuquerque, that I can say honestly. But Clermont,--there I\r\nenvy you. I should like to see my own mountains again. At least you will\r\nsee all my family and bring me word of them, and you can bring me the\r\nvestments that my dear sister Philom\xc3\xa8ne and her nuns have been making\r\nfor me these three years. I shall be very glad to have them." He rose,\r\nand took up one of the candles. "And when you leave Clermont, Jean, put\r\na few chestnuts in your pocket for me!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE MISER\r\n\r\n\r\nIN February Bishop Latour once more set out on horseback over the Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9 trail, this time with Rome as his objective. He was absent for\r\nnearly a year, and when he returned he brought with him four young\r\npriests from his own Seminary of Montferrand, and a Spanish priest,\r\nFather Taladrid, whom he had found in Rome, and who was at once sent to\r\nTaos. At the Bishop\'s suggestion, Padre Martinez formally resigned his\r\nparish, with the understanding that he was still to celebrate Mass upon\r\nsolemn occasions. Not only did he avail himself of this privilege, but\r\nhe continued to perform all marriages and burial services and to dictate\r\nthe lives of the parishioners. Very soon he and Father Taladrid were at\r\nopen war.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bishop, unable to compose their differences, supported the new\r\npriest, Father Martinez and his friend Father Lucero, of Arroyo Hondo,\r\nmutinied; flatly refused to submit, and organized a church of their own.\r\nThis, they declared, was the old Holy Catholic Church of Mexico, while\r\nthe Bishop\'s church was an American institution. In both towns the\r\ngreater part of the population went over to the schismatic church,\r\nthough some pious Mexicans, in great perplexity, attended Mass at both.\r\nFather Martinez printed a long and eloquent Proclamation (which very few\r\nof his parishioners could read) giving an historical justification for\r\nhis schism, and denying the obligation of celibacy for the priesthood.\r\nAs both he and Father Lucero were well on in years, this particular\r\nclause could be of little benefit to anyone in their new organization\r\nexcept Trinidad. After the two old priests went off into schism, one of\r\ntheir first solemn acts was to elevate Father Lucero\'s nephew to the\r\npriesthood, and he acted as curate to them both, swinging back and forth\r\nbetween Taos and Arroyo Hondo.\r\n\r\nThe schismatic church at least accomplished the rejuvenation of the two\r\nrebellious priests at its head, and far and wide revived men\'s interest\r\nin them,--though they had always furnished their people with plenty to\r\ntalk about. Ever since they were young men with adjoining parishes, they\r\nhad been friends, cronies, rivals, sometimes bitter enemies. But their\r\nquarrels could never keep them apart for long.\r\n\r\nOld Marino Lucero had not one trait in common with Martinez, except the\r\nlove of authority. He had been a miser from his youth, and lived down in\r\nthe sunken world of Arroyo Hondo in the barest poverty, though he was\r\nsupposed to be very rich. He used to boast that his house was as poor as\r\na burro\'s stable. His bed, his crucifix, and his bean-pot were his\r\nfurniture. He kept no live-stock but one poor mule, on which he rode\r\nover to Taos to quarrel with his friend Martinez, or to get a solid\r\ndinner when he was hungry. In his _casa_ every day was Friday--unless\r\none of his neighbour women cooked a chicken and brought it in to him out\r\nof pure compassion. For his people liked him. He was grasping, but not\r\noppressive, and he wrung more pesos out of Arroyo Seco and Questa than\r\nout of his own arroyo. Thrift is such a rare quality among Mexicans that\r\nthey find it very amusing; his people loved to tell how he never bought\r\nanything, but picked up old brooms after housewives had thrown them\r\naway, and that he wore Padre Martinez\'s garments after the Padre would\r\nhave them no longer, though they were so much too big for him. One of\r\nthe priests\' fiercest quarrels had come about because Martinez gave some\r\nof his old clothes to a monk from Mexico who was studying at his house,\r\nand who had not wherewithal to cover himself as winter came on.\r\n\r\nThe two priests had always talked shamelessly about each other. All\r\nMartinez\'s best stories were about Lucero, and all Lucero\'s were about\r\nMartinez.\r\n\r\n"You see how it is," Padre Lucero would say to the young men at a\r\nwedding party, "my way is better than old Jos\xc3\xa9 Martinez\'s. His nose and\r\nchin are getting to be close neighbours now, and a petticoat is not much\r\ngood to him any more. But I can still rise upright at the sight of a\r\ndollar. With a new piece of money in my hand I am happier than ever; and\r\nwhat can he do with a pretty girl but regret?"\r\n\r\nAvarice, he assured them, was the one passion that grew stronger and\r\nsweeter in old age. He had the lust for money as Martinez had for women,\r\nand they had never been rivals in the pursuit of their pleasures. After\r\nTrinidad was ordained and went to stay with his uncle, Father Lucero\r\ncomplained that he had formed gross habits living with Martinez, and was\r\neating him out of house and home. Father Martinez told with delight how\r\nTrinidad sponged upon the parish at Arroyo Hondo, and went about poking\r\nhis nose into one bean-pot after another.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bishop could no longer remain deaf to the rebellion, he sent\r\nFather Vaillant over to Taos to publish the warning for three weeks and\r\nexhort the two priests to renounce their heresy. On the fourth Sunday\r\nFather Joseph, who complained that he was always sent "_\xc3\xa0 fouetter les\r\nchats_," solemnly read the letter in which the Bishop stripped Father\r\nMartinez of the rights and privileges of the priesthood. On the\r\nafternoon of the same day, he rode over to Arroyo Hondo, eighteen miles\r\naway, and read a similar letter of excommunication against Father\r\nLucero.\r\n\r\nFather Martinez continued at the head of his schismatic church until,\r\nafter a short illness, he died and was buried in schism, by Father\r\nLucero. Soon after this, Father Lucero himself fell into a decline. But\r\neven after he was ailing he performed a feat which became one of the\r\nlegends of the country-side,--killed a robber in a midnight scuffle.\r\n\r\nA wandering teamster who had been discharged from a wagon train for\r\ntheft, was picking up a living over in Taos and there heard the stories\r\nabout Father Lucero\'s hidden riches. He came to Arroyo Hondo to rob the\r\nold man. Father Lucero was a light sleeper, and hearing stealthy sounds\r\nin the middle of the night, he reached for the carving-knife he kept\r\nhidden under his mattress and sprang upon the intruder. They began\r\nfighting in the dark, and though the thief was a young man and armed,\r\nthe old priest stabbed him to death and then, covered with blood, ran\r\nout to arouse the town. The neighbours found the Padre\'s chamber like a\r\nslaughter-house, his victim hang dead beside the hole he had dug. They\r\nwere amazed at what the old man had been able to do.\r\n\r\nBut from the shock of that night Father Lucero never recovered. He\r\nwasted away so rapidly that his people had the horse doctor come from\r\nTaos to look at him. This veterinary was a Yankee who had been\r\nsuccessful in treating men as well as horses, but he said he could do\r\nnothing for Father Lucero; he believed he had an internal tumour or a\r\ncancer.\r\n\r\nPadre Lucero died repentant, and Father Vaillant, who had pronounced his\r\nexcommunication, was the one to reconcile him to the Church. The Vicar\r\nwas in Taos on business for the Bishop, staying with Kit Carson and the\r\nSe\xc3\xb1ora. They were all sitting at supper one evening during a heavy\r\nrain-storm, when a horseman rode up to the _portale_. Carson went out to\r\nreceive him. The visitor he brought in with him was Trinidad Lucero, who\r\ntook off his rubber coat and stood in a full-skirted cassock of Arroyo\r\nHondo make, a crucifix about his neck, seeming to fill the room with his\r\nsize and importance. After bowing ceremoniously to the Se\xc3\xb1ora, he\r\naddressed himself to Father Vaillant in his best English, speaking\r\nslowly in his thick felty voice.\r\n\r\n"I am the only nephew of Padre Lucero. My uncle is verra seek and soon\r\nto die. She has vomit the blood." He dropped his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Speak to me in your own language, man!" cried Father Joseph. "I can at\r\nleast do more with Spanish than you can with English. Now tell me what\r\nyou have to say of your uncle\'s condition."\r\n\r\nTrinidad gave some account of his uncle\'s illness, repeating solemnly\r\nthe phrase, "She has vomit the blood," which he seemed to find\r\nimpressive. The sick man wished to see Father Vaillant, and begged that\r\nhe would come to him and give him the Sacrament.\r\n\r\nCarson urged the Vicar to wait until morning, as the road down into "the\r\nHondo" would be badly washed by rain and dangerous to go over in the\r\ndark. But Father Vaillant said if the road were bad he could go down on\r\nfoot. Excusing himself to the Se\xc3\xb1ora Carson, he went to his room to put\r\non his riding-clothes and get his saddle-bags. Trinidad, upon\r\ninvitation, sat down at the empty place and made the most of his\r\nopportunity. The host saddled Father Vaillant\'s mule, and the Vicar rode\r\naway, with Trinidad for guide.\r\n\r\nNot that he needed a guide to Arroyo Hondo, it was a place especially\r\ndear to him, and he was always glad to find a pretext for going there.\r\nHow often he had ridden over there on fine days in summer, or in early\r\nspring, before the green was out, when the whole country was pink and\r\nblue and yellow, like a coloured map.\r\n\r\nOne approached over a sage-brush plain that appeared to run level and\r\nunbroken to the base of the distant mountains; then without warning, one\r\nsuddenly found oneself upon the brink of a precipice, of a chasm in the\r\nearth over two hundred feet deep, the sides sheer cliffs, but cliffs of\r\nearth, not rock. Drawing rein at the edge, one looked down into a sunken\r\nworld of green fields and gardens, with a pink adobe town, at the bottom\r\nof this great ditch. The men and mules walking about down there, or\r\nplowing the fields, looked like the figures of a child\'s Noah\'s ark.\r\nDown the middle of the arroyo, through the sunken fields and pastures,\r\nflowed a rushing stream which came from the high mountains. Its original\r\nsource was so high, indeed, that by merely laying an open wooden trough\r\nup the opposite side of the arroyo, the Mexicans conveyed the water to\r\nthe plateau at the top. This sluice was laid in sections that zigzagged\r\nup the face of the cliff. Father Vaillant always stopped to watch the\r\nwater rushing up the side of the precipice like a thing alive; an\r\never-ascending ladder of clear water, gurgling and clouding into silver\r\nas it climbed. Only once before, he used to tell the natives, in Italy,\r\nhad he seen water run up hill like that.\r\n\r\nThe water thus diverted was but a tiny thread of the full creek; the\r\nmain stream ran down the arroyo over a white rock bottom, with green\r\nwillows and deep hay grass and brilliant wild flowers on its banks.\r\nEvening primroses, the fireweed, and butterfly weed grew to a tropical\r\nsize and brilliance there among the sedges.\r\n\r\nBut this was the first time Father Vaillant had ever gone down into the\r\nHondo after dark, and at the edge of the cliff he decided not to put\r\nContento to so cruel a test. "He can do it," he said to Trinidad, "but I\r\nwill not make him." He dismounted and went on foot down the steep\r\nwinding trail.\r\n\r\nThey reached Father Lucero\'s house before midnight. Half the population\r\nof the town seemed to be in attendance, and the place was lit up as if\r\nfor a festival. The sick man\'s chamber was full of Mexican women,\r\nsitting about on the floor, wrapped in their black shawls, saying their\r\nprayers with lighted candles before them. One could scarcely step for\r\nthe candles.\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant beckoned to a woman he knew well, Con\xc3\xa7eption Gonzales,\r\nand asked her what was the meaning of this. She whispered that the dying\r\nPadre would have it so. His sight was growing dim, and he kept calling\r\nfor more lights. All his life, Con\xc3\xa7eption sighed, he had been so saving\r\nof candles, and had mostly done with a pine splinter in the evenings.\r\n\r\nIn the corner, on the bed, Father Lucero was groaning and tossing, one\r\nman rubbing his feet, and another wringing cloths out of hot water and\r\nputting them on his stomach to dull the pain. Se\xc3\xb1ora Gonzales whispered\r\nthat the sick man had been gnawing the sheets for pain; she had brought\r\nover her best ones, and they were chewed to lacework across the top.\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant approached the bed-side, "Get away from the bed a\r\nlittle, my good women. Arrange yourselves along the wall, your candles\r\nblind me."\r\n\r\nBut as they began rising and lifting their candlesticks from the floor,\r\nthe sick man called, "No, no, do not take away the lights! Some thief\r\nwill come, and I will have nothing left."\r\n\r\nThe women shrugged, looked reproachfully at Father Vaillant, and sat\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\nPadre Lucero was wasted to the bones. His cheeks were sunken, his hooked\r\nnose was clay-coloured and waxy, his eyes were wild with fever. They\r\nburned up at Father Joseph,--great, black, glittering, distrustful eyes.\r\nOn this night of his departure the old man looked more Spaniard than\r\nMexican. He clutched Father Joseph\'s hand with a grip surprisingly\r\nstrong, and gave the man who was rubbing his feet a vigorous kick in the\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n"Have done with my feet there, and take away these wet rags. Now that\r\nthe Vicar has come, I have something to say, and I want you all to\r\nhear." Father Lucero\'s voice had always been thin and high in pitch, his\r\nparishioners used to say it was like a horse talking. "Se\xc3\xb1or Vicario,\r\nyou remember Padre Martinez? You ought to, for you served him as badly\r\nas you did me. Now listen:"\r\n\r\nFather Lucero related that Martinez, before his death, had entrusted to\r\nhim a certain sum of money to be spent in masses for the repose of his\r\nsoul, these to be offered at his native church in Abiquiu. Lucero had\r\nnot used the money as he promised, but had buried it under the dirt\r\nfloor of this room, just below the large crucifix that hung on the wall\r\nyonder.\r\n\r\nAt this point Father Vaillant again signalled to the women to withdraw,\r\nbut as they took up their candles, Father Lucero sat up in his\r\nnight-shirt and cried, "Stay as you are! Are you going to run away and\r\nleave me with a stranger? I trust him no more than I do you! Oh, why did\r\nGod not make some way for a man to protect his own after death? Alive, I\r\ncan do it with my knife, old as I am. But after?"----\r\n\r\nThe Se\xc3\xb1ora Gonzales soothed Father Lucero, persuaded him to lie back\r\nupon his pillows and tell them what he wanted them to do. He explained\r\nthat this money which he had taken in trust from Martinez was to be sent\r\nto Abiquiu and used as the Padre had wished. Under the crucifix, and\r\nunder the floor beneath the bed on which he was lying, they would find\r\nhis own savings. One third of his hoard was for Trinidad. The rest was\r\nto be spent in masses for his soul, and they were to be celebrated in\r\nthe old church of San Miguel in Santa F\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant assured him that all his wishes should be scrupulously\r\ncarried out, and now it was time for him to dismiss the cares of this\r\nworld and prepare his mind to receive the Sacrament.\r\n\r\n"All in good time. But a man does not let go of this world so easily.\r\nWhere is Con\xc3\xa7eption Gonzales? Come here, my daughter. See to it that\r\nthe money is taken up from under the floor while I am still in this\r\nchamber, before my body is cold, that it is counted in the presence of\r\nall these women, and the sum set down in writing." At this point, the\r\nold man started, as with a new hope. "And Christobal, he is the man!\r\nChristobal Carson must be here to count it and set it down. He is a just\r\nman. Trinidad, you fool, why did you not bring Christobal?"\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant was scandalized. "Unless you compose yourself, Father\r\nLucero, and fix your thoughts upon Heaven, I shall refuse to administer\r\nthe Sacrament. In your present state of mind, it would be a sacrilege."\r\n\r\nThe old man folded his hands and closed his eyes in assent. Father\r\nVaillant went into the adjoining room to put on his cassock and stole,\r\nand in his absence Con\xc3\xa7eption Gonzales covered a small table by the bed\r\nwith one of her own white napkins and placed upon it two wax candles,\r\nand a cup of water for the ministrant\'s hands. Father Vaillant came back\r\nin his vestments, with his pyx and basin of holy water, and began\r\nsprinkling the bed and the watchers, repeating the antiphon, _Asperges\r\nme, Domine, hyssopo, et mundabor_. The women stole away, leaving their\r\nlights upon the floor. Father Lucero made his confession, renouncing his\r\nheresy and expressing contrition, after which he received the Sacrament.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony calmed the tormented man, and he lay quiet with his hands\r\nfolded on his breast. The women returned and sat murmuring prayers as\r\nbefore. The rain drove against the window panes, the wind made a hollow\r\nsound as it sucked down through the deep arroyo. Some of the watchers\r\nwere drooping from weariness, but not one showed any wish to go home.\r\nWatching beside a death-bed was not a hardship for them, but a\r\nprivilege,--in the case of a dying priest it was a distinction.\r\n\r\nIn those days, even in European countries, death had a solemn social\r\nimportance. It was not regarded as a moment when certain bodily organs\r\nceased to function, but as a dramatic climax, a moment when the soul\r\nmade its entrance into the next world, passing in full consciousness\r\nthrough a lowly door to an unimaginable scene. Among the watchers there\r\nwas always the hope that the dying man might reveal something of what he\r\nalone could see; that his countenance, if not his lips, would speak, and\r\non his features would fall some light or shadow from beyond. The "Last\r\nWords" of great men, Napoleon, Lord Byron, were still printed in\r\ngift-books, and the dying murmurs of every common man and woman were\r\nlistened for and treasured by their neighbours and kinsfolk. These\r\nsayings, no matter how unimportant, were given oracular significance and\r\npondered by those who must one day go the same road.\r\n\r\nThe stillness of the death chamber was suddenly broken when Trinidad\r\nLucero knelt down before the crucifix on the wall to pray. His uncle,\r\nthough all thought him asleep, began to struggle and cry out, "A thief!\r\nHelp, help!" Trinidad retired quickly, but after that the old man lay\r\nwith one eye open, and no one dared go near the crucifix.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before day-break the Padre\'s breathing became so painful\r\nthat two of the men got behind him and lifted his pillows. The women\r\nwhispered that his face was changing, and they brought their candles\r\nnearer, kneeling close beside his bed. His eyes were alive and had\r\nperception in them. He rolled his head to one side and lay looking\r\nintently down into the candlelight, without blinking, while his\r\nfeatures sharpened. Several times his lips twitched back over his teeth.\r\nThe watchers held their breath, feeling sure that he would speak before\r\nhe passed,--and he did. After a facial spasm that was like a sardonic\r\nsmile, and a clicking of breath in his mouth, their Padre spoke like a\r\nhorse for the last time:\r\n\r\n"_Comete tu cola, Martinez, comete tu cola_!" (Eat your tail, Martinez,\r\neat your tail!) Almost at once he died in a convulsion.\r\n\r\nAfter day-break Trinidad went forth declaring (and the Mexican women\r\nconfirmed him) that at the moment of death Father Lucero had looked into\r\nthe other world and beheld Padre Martinez in torment. As long as the\r\nChristians who were about that death-bed lived, the story was whispered\r\nin Arroyo Hondo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the floor of the priest\'s house was taken up, according to his last\r\ninstructions, people came from as far as Taos and Santa Cruz and Mora to\r\nsee the buckskin bags of gold and silver coin that were buried beneath\r\nit. Spanish coins, French, American, English, some of them very old.\r\nWhen it was at length conveyed to a Government mint and examined, it was\r\nvalued at nearly twenty thousand dollars in American money. A great sum\r\nfor one old priest to have scraped together in a country parish down at\r\nthe bottom of a ditch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SIX\r\n\r\n_DO\xc3\x91A ISABELLA_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nDON ANTONIO\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP LATOUR had one very keen worldly ambition; to build in Santa F\xc3\xa9\r\na cathedral which would be worthy of a setting naturally beautiful. As\r\nhe cherished this wish and meditated upon it, he came to feel that such\r\na building might be a continuation of himself and his purpose, a\r\nphysical body full of his aspirations after he had passed from the\r\nscene. Early in his administration he began setting aside something from\r\nhis meagre resources for a cathedral fund. In this he was assisted by\r\ncertain of the rich Mexican _rancheros_, but by no one so much as by Don\r\nAntonio Olivares.\r\n\r\nAntonio Olivares was the most intelligent and prosperous member of a\r\nlarge family of brothers and cousins, and he was for that time and place\r\na man of wide experience, a man of the world. He had spent the greater\r\npart of his life in New Orleans and El Paso del Norte, but he returned\r\nto live in Santa F\xc3\xa9 several years after Bishop Latour took up his\r\nduties there. He brought with him his American wife and a wagon train of\r\nfurniture, and settled down to spend his declining years in the old\r\nranch house just east of the town where he was born and had grown up. He\r\nwas then a man of sixty. In early manhood he had lost his first wife;\r\nafter he went to New Orleans he had married a second time, a Kentucky\r\ngirl who had grown up among her relatives in Louisiana. She was pretty\r\nand accomplished, had been educated at a French convent, and had done\r\nmuch to Europeanize her husband. The refinement of his dress and\r\nmanners, and his lavish style of living, provoked half-contemptuous envy\r\namong his brothers and their friends.\r\n\r\nOlivares\'s wife, Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella, was a devout Catholic, and at their\r\nhouse the French priests were always welcome and were most cordially\r\nentertained. The Se\xc3\xb1ora Olivares had made a pleasant place of the\r\nrambling adobe building, with its great courtyard and gateway, carved\r\njoists and beams, fine herring-bone ceilings and snug fire-places. She\r\nwas a gracious hostess, and though no longer very young, she was still\r\nattractive to the eye; a slight woman, spirited, quick in movement, with\r\na delicate blonde complexion which she had successfully guarded in\r\ntrying climates, and fair hair--a little silvered, and perhaps worn in\r\ntoo many puffs and ringlets for the sharpening outline of her face. She\r\nspoke French well, Spanish lamely, played the harp, and sang agreeably.\r\n\r\nCertainly it was a great piece of luck for Father Latour and Father\r\nVaillant, who lived so much among peons and Indians and rough\r\nfrontiersmen, to be able to converse in their own tongue now and then\r\nwith a cultivated woman; to sit by that hospitable fireside, in rooms\r\nenriched by old mirrors and engravings and upholstered chairs, where the\r\nwindows had clean curtains, and the sideboard and cupboards were stocked\r\nwith plate and Belgian glass. It was refreshing to spend an evening with\r\na couple who were interested in what was going on in the outside world,\r\nto eat a good dinner and drink good wine, and listen to music. Father\r\nJoseph, that man of inconsistencies, had a pleasing tenor voice, true\r\nthough not strong. Madame Olivares liked to sing old French songs with\r\nhim. She was a trifle vain, it must be owned, and when she sang at all,\r\ninsisted upon singing in three languages, never forgetting her husband\'s\r\nfavourites, "La Paloma" and "La Golandrina," and "My Nelly Was A Lady."\r\nThe negro melodies of Stephen Foster had already travelled to the\r\nfrontier, going along the river highways, not in print, but passed on\r\nfrom one humble singer to another.\r\n\r\nDon Antonio was a large man, heavy, full at the belt, a trifle bald, and\r\nvery slow of speech. But his eyes were lively, and the yellow spark in\r\nthem was often most perceptible when he was quite silent. It was\r\ninteresting to observe him after dinner, settled in one of his big\r\nchairs from New Orleans, a cigar between his long golden-brown fingers,\r\nwatching his wife at her harp.\r\n\r\nThere was gossip about the lady in Santa F\xc3\xa9, of course, since she had\r\nretained her beautiful complexion and her husband\'s devoted regard for\r\nso many years. The Americans and the Olivares brothers said she dressed\r\nmuch too youthfully, which was perhaps true, and that she had lovers in\r\nNew Orleans and El Paso del Norte. Her nephews-in-law went so far as to\r\ndeclare that she was enamoured of the Mexican boy the Olivares had\r\nbrought up from San Antonio to play the banjo for them,--they both loved\r\nmusic, and this boy, Pablo, was a magician with his instrument. All\r\nsorts of stories went out from the kitchen; that Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella had a\r\nwhole chamber full of dresses so grand that she never wore them here at\r\nall; that she took gold from her husband\'s pockets and hid it under the\r\nfloor of her room; that she gave him love potions and herb-teas to\r\nincrease his ardour. This gossip did not mean that her servants were\r\ndisloyal, but rather that they were proud of their mistress.\r\n\r\nOlivares, who read the newspapers, though they were weeks old when he\r\ngot them, who liked cigars better than cigarettes, and French wine\r\nbetter than whisky, had little in common with his younger brothers. Next\r\nto his old friend Manuel Chavez, the two French priests were the men in\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9 whose company he most enjoyed, and he let them see it. He was\r\na man who cherished his friends. He liked to call at the Bishop\'s house\r\nto advise him about the care of his young orchard, or to leave a bottle\r\nof home-made cherry brandy for Father Joseph. It was Olivares who\r\npresented Father Latour with the silver hand-basin and pitcher and\r\ntoilet accessories which gave him so much satisfaction all the rest of\r\nhis life. There were good silversmiths among the Mexicans of Santa F\xc3\xa9,\r\nand Don Antonio had his own toilet-set copied in hammered silver for his\r\nfriend. Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella once remarked that her husband always gave Father\r\nVaillant something good for the palate, and Father Latour something good\r\nfor the eye.\r\n\r\nThis couple had one child, a daughter, the Se\xc3\xb1orita Inez, born long ago\r\nand still unmarried. Indeed, it was generally understood that she would\r\nnever marry. Though she had not taken the veil, her life was that of a\r\nnun. She was very plain and had none of her mother\'s social graces, but\r\nshe had a beautiful contralto voice. She sang in the Cathedral choir in\r\nNew Orleans, and taught singing in a convent there. She came to visit\r\nher parents only once after they settled in Santa F\xc3\xa9, and she was a\r\nsomewhat sombre figure in that convivial household. Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella\r\nseemed devotedly attached to her, but afraid of displeasing her. While\r\nInez was there, her mother dressed very plainly, pinned back the little\r\ncurls that hung over her right ear, and the two women went to church\r\ntogether all day long.\r\n\r\nAntonio Olivares was deeply interested in the Bishop\'s dream of a\r\ncathedral. For one thing, he saw that Father Latour had set his heart on\r\nbuilding one, and Olivares was the sort of man who liked to help a\r\nfriend accomplish the desire of his heart. Furthermore, he had a deep\r\naffection for his native town, he had travelled and seen fine churches,\r\nand he wished there might some day be one in Santa F\xc3\xa9. Many a night he\r\nand Father Latour talked of it by the fire; discussed the site, the\r\ndesign, the building stone, the cost and the grave difficulties of\r\nraising money. It was the Bishop\'s hope to begin work upon the building\r\nin 1860, ten years after his appointment to the Bishopric. One night, at\r\na long-remembered New Year\'s party in his house, Olivares announced in\r\nthe presence of his guests that before the new year was gone he meant to\r\ngive to the Cathedral fund a sum sufficient to enable Father Latour to\r\ncarry out his purpose.\r\n\r\nThat supper party at the Olivares\' was memorable because of this pledge,\r\nand because it marked a parting of old friends. Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella was\r\nentertaining the officers at the Post, two of whom had received orders\r\nto leave Santa F\xc3\xa9. The popular Commandant was called back to\r\nWashington, the young lieutenant of cavalry, an Irish Catholic, lately\r\nmarried and very dear to Father Latour, was to be sent farther west.\r\n(Before the next New Year\'s Day came round he was killed in Indian\r\nwarfare on the plains of Arizona.)\r\n\r\nBut that night the future troubled nobody; the house was full of light\r\nand music, the air warm with that simple hospitality of the frontier,\r\nwhere people dwell in exile, far from their kindred, where they lead\r\nrough lives and seldom meet together for pleasure. Kit Carson, who\r\ngreatly admired Madame Olivares, had come the two days\' journey from\r\nTaos to be present that night, and brought along his gentle half-breed\r\ndaughter, lately home from a convent school in St. Louis. On this\r\noccasion he wore a handsome buckskin coat, embroidered in silver, with\r\nbrown velvet cuffs and collar. The officers from the Fort were in dress\r\nuniform, the host as usual wore a broadcloth frock-coat. His wife was in\r\na hoop-skirt, a French dress from New Orleans, all covered with little\r\ngarlands of pink satin roses. The military ladies came out to the\r\nOlivares place in an army wagon, to keep their satin shoes from the mud.\r\nThe Bishop had put on his violet vest, which he seldom wore, and Father\r\nVaillant had donned a fresh new cassock, made by the loving hands of his\r\nsister Philom\xc3\xa8ne, in Riom.\r\n\r\nFather Latour had used to feel a little ashamed that Joseph kept his\r\nsister and her nuns so busy making cassocks and vestments for him; but\r\nthe last time he was in France he came to see all this in another light.\r\nWhen he was visiting Mother Philom\xc3\xa8ne\'s convent, one of the younger\r\nSisters had confided to him what an inspiration it was to them, living\r\nin retirement, to work for the far-away missions. She told him also how\r\nprecious to them were Father Vaillant\'s long letters, letters in which\r\nhe told his sister of the country, the Indians, the pious Mexican women,\r\nthe Spanish martyrs of old. These letters, she said, Mother Philom\xc3\xa8ne\r\nread aloud in the evening. The nun took Father Latour to a window that\r\njutted out and looked up the narrow street to where the wall turned at\r\nan angle, cutting off further view. "Look," she said, "after the Mother\r\nhas read us one of those letters from her brother, I come and stand in\r\nthis alcove and look up our little street with its one lamp, and just\r\nbeyond the turn there, is New Mexico; all that he has written us of\r\nthose red deserts and blue mountains, the great plains and the herds of\r\nbison, and the canyons more profound than our deepest mountain gorges. I\r\ncan feel that I am there, my heart beats faster, and it seems but a\r\nmoment until the retiring-bell cuts short my dreams." The Bishop went\r\naway believing that it was good for these Sisters to work for Father\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\nTo-night, when Madame Olivares was complimenting Father Vaillant on the\r\nsheen of his poplin and velvet, for some reason Father Latour recalled\r\nthat moment with the nun in her alcove window, her white face, her\r\nburning eyes, and sighed.\r\n\r\nAfter supper was over and the toasts had been drunk, the boy Pablo was\r\ncalled in to play for the company while the gentlemen smoked. The banjo\r\nalways remained a foreign instrument to Father Latour; he found it more\r\nthan a little savage. When this strange yellow boy played it, there was\r\nsoftness and languor in the wire strings--but there was also a kind\r\nof madness; the recklessness, the call of wild countries which all these\r\nmen had felt and followed in one way or another. Through clouds of cigar\r\nsmoke, the scout and the soldiers, the Mexican _rancheros_ and the\r\npriests, sat silently watching the bent head and crouching shoulders of\r\nthe banjo player, and his seesawing yellow hand, which sometimes lost\r\nall form and became a mere whirl of matter in motion, like a patch of\r\nsand-storm.\r\n\r\nObserving them thus in repose, in the act of reflection, Father Latour\r\nwas thinking how each of these men not only had a story, but seemed to\r\nhave become his story. Those anxious, far-seeing blue eyes of Carson\'s,\r\nto whom could they belong but to a scout and trail-breaker? Don Manuel\r\nChavez, the handsomest man of the company, very elegant in velvet and\r\nbroadcloth, with delicately cut, disdainful features,--one had only to\r\nsee him cross the room, or to sit next him at dinner, to feel the\r\nelectric quality under his cold reserve; the fierceness of some\r\nembitterment, the passion for danger.\r\n\r\nChavez boasted his descent from two Castilian knights who freed the city\r\nof Chavez from the Moors in 1160. He had estates in the Pecos and in the\r\nSan Mateo mountains, and a house in Santa F\xc3\xa9, where he hid himself\r\nbehind his beautiful trees and gardens. He loved the natural beauties of\r\nhis country with a passion, and he hated the Americans who were blind to\r\nthem. He was jealous of Carson\'s fame as an Indian-fighter, declaring\r\nthat he had seen more Indian warfare before he was twenty than Carson\r\nwould ever see. He was easily Carson\'s rival as a pistol shot. With the\r\nbow and arrow he had no rival; he had never been beaten. No Indian had\r\never been known to shoot an arrow as far as Chavez. Every year parties\r\nof Indians came up to the Villa to shoot with him for wagers. His house\r\nand stables were full of trophies. He took a cool pleasure in stripping\r\nthe Indians of their horses or silver or blankets, or whatever they had\r\nput up on their man. He was proud of his skill with Indian weapons; he\r\nhad acquired it in a hard school.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a lad of sixteen Manuel Chavez had gone out with a party of\r\nMexican youths to hunt Navajos. In those days, before the American\r\noccupation, "hunting Navajos" needed no pretext, it was a form of sport.\r\nA company of Mexicans would ride west to the Navajo country, raid a few\r\nsheep camps, and come home bringing flocks and ponies and a bunch of\r\nprisoners, for every one of whom they received a large bounty from the\r\nMexican Government. It was with such a raiding party that the boy Chavez\r\nwent out for spoil and adventure.\r\n\r\nFinding no Indians abroad, the young Mexicans pushed on farther than\r\nthey had intended. They did not know that it was the season when all the\r\nroving Navajo bands gather at the Canyon de Chelly for their religious\r\nceremonies, and they rode on impetuously until they came out upon the\r\nrim of that mysterious and terrifying canyon itself, then swarming with\r\nIndians. They were immediately surrounded, and retreat was impossible.\r\nThey fought on the naked sandstone ledges that overhang that gulf. Don\r\nJos\xc3\xa9 Chavez, Manuel\'s older brother, was captain of the party, and was\r\none of the first to fall. The company of fifty were slaughtered to a\r\nman. Manuel was the fifty-first, and he survived. With seven arrow\r\nwounds, and one shaft clear through his body, he was left for dead in a\r\npile of corpses.\r\n\r\nThat night, while the Navajos were celebrating their victory, the boy\r\ncrawled along the rocks until he had high boulders between him and the\r\nenemy, and then started eastward on foot. It was summer, and the heat of\r\nthat red sandstone country is intense. His wounds were on fire. But he\r\nhad the superb vitality of early youth. He walked for two days and\r\nnights without finding a drop of water, covering a distance of sixty odd\r\nmiles, across the plain, across the mountain, until he came to the\r\nfamous spring on the other side, where Fort Defiance was afterward\r\nbuilt. There he drank and bathed his wounds and slept. He had had no\r\nfood since the morning before the fight; near the spring he found some\r\nlarge cactus plants, and slicing away the spines with his hunting-knife,\r\nhe filled his stomach with the juicy pulp.\r\n\r\nFrom here, still without meeting a human creature, he stumbled on until\r\nhe reached the San Mateo mountain, north of Laguna. In a mountain valley\r\nhe came upon a camp of Mexican shepherds, and fell unconscious. The\r\nshepherds made a litter of saplings and their sheepskin coats and\r\ncarried him into the village of Cebolleta, where he lay delirious for\r\nmany days. Years afterward, when Chavez came into his inheritance, he\r\nbought that beautiful valley in the San Mateo mountain where he had sunk\r\nunconscious under two noble oak trees. He built a house between those\r\ntwin oaks, and made a fine estate there.\r\n\r\nNever reconciled to American rule, Chavez lived in seclusion when he was\r\nin Santa F\xc3\xa9. At the first rumour of an Indian outbreak, near or far, he\r\nrode off to add a few more scalps to his record. He distrusted the new\r\nBishop because of his friendliness toward Indians and Yankees. Besides,\r\nChavez was a Martinez man. He had come here to-night only in compliment\r\nto Se\xc3\xb1ora Olivares; he hated to spend an evening among American\r\nuniforms.\r\n\r\nWhen the banjo player was exhausted, Father Joseph said that as for him,\r\nhe would like a little drawing-room music, and he led Madame Olivares to\r\nher harp. She was very charming at her instrument; the pose suited her\r\ntip-tilted canary head, and her little foot and white arms.\r\n\r\nThis was the last time the Bishop heard her sing "La Paloma" for her\r\nadmiring husband, whose eyes smiled at her even when his heavy face\r\nseemed asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlivares died on Septuagesima Sunday--fell over by his own fire-place\r\nwhen he was lighting the candles after supper, and the banjo boy was\r\nsent running for the Bishop. Before midnight two of the Olivares\r\nbrothers, half drunk with brandy and excitement, galloped out of Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9, on the road to Albuquerque, to employ an American lawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE LADY\r\n\r\n\r\nANTONIO OLIVARES\'S funeral was the most solemn and magnificent ever seen\r\nin Santa F\xc3\xa9, but Father Vaillant was not there. He was off on a long\r\nmissionary journey to the south, and did not reach home until Madame\r\nOlivares had been a widow for some weeks. He had scarcely got off his\r\nriding-boots when he was called into Father Latour\'s study to see her\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\nOlivares had entrusted the management of his affairs to a young Irish\r\nCatholic, Boyd O\'Reilly, who had come out from Boston to practise law in\r\nthe new Territory. There were no steel safes in Santa F\xc3\xa9 at that time,\r\nbut O\'Reilly had kept Olivares\'s will in his strong-box. The document\r\nwas brief and clear: Antonio\'s estate amounted to about two hundred\r\nthousand dollars in American money (a considerable fortune in those\r\ndays). The income therefrom was to be enjoyed by "my wife, Isabella\r\nOlivares, and her daughter, Inez Olivares," during their lives, and\r\nafter their decease his property was to go to the Church, to the Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Faith. The codicil, in favour of the\r\nCathedral fund, had, unfortunately, never been added to the will.\r\n\r\nThe young lawyer explained to Father Vaillant that the Olivares brothers\r\nhad retained the leading legal firm of Albuquerque and were contesting\r\nthe will. Their point of attack was that Se\xc3\xb1orita Inez was too old to\r\nbe the daughter of the Se\xc3\xb1ora Olivares. Don Antonio had been a\r\npromiscuous lover in his young days, and his brothers held that Inez was\r\nthe offspring of some temporary attachment, and had been adopted by\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Isabella. O\'Reilly had sent to New Orleans for an attested copy of\r\nthe marriage record of the Olivares couple, and the birth certificate of\r\nSe\xc3\xb1orita Inez. But in Kentucky, where the Se\xc3\xb1ora was born, no birth\r\nrecords were kept; there was no document to prove the age of Isabella\r\nOlivares, and she could not be persuaded to admit her true age. It was\r\ngenerally believed in Santa F\xc3\xa9 that she was still in her early forties,\r\nin which case she would not have been more than six or eight years old\r\nat the date when Inez was born. In reality the lady was past fifty, but\r\nwhen O\'Reilly had tried to persuade her to admit this in court, she\r\nsimply refused to listen to him. He begged the Bishop and the Vicar to\r\nuse their influence with her to this end.\r\n\r\nFather Latour shrank from interfering in so delicate a matter, but\r\nFather Vaillant saw at once that it was their plain duty to protect the\r\ntwo women and, at the same time, secure the rights of the Propaganda.\r\nWithout more ado he threw on his old cloak over his cassock, and the\r\nthree men set off through the red mud to the Olivares hacienda in the\r\nhills east of the town.\r\n\r\nFather Joseph had not been to the Olivares\' house since the night of the\r\nNew Year\'s party, and he sighed as he approached the place, already\r\ntransformed by neglect. The big gate was propped open by a pole because\r\nthe iron hook was gone, the courtyard was littered with rags and meat\r\nbones which the dogs had carried there and no one had taken away. The\r\nbig parrot cage, hanging in the _portale_, was filthy, and the birds\r\nwere squalling. When O\'Reilly rang the bell at the outer gate, Pablo,\r\nthe banjo player, came running out with tousled hair and a dirty shirt\r\nto admit the visitors. He took them into the long living-room, which was\r\nempty and cold, the fire-place dark, the hearth unswept. Chairs and\r\nwindow-sills were deep in red dust, the glass panes dirty, and streaked\r\nas if by tear-drops. On the writing-table were empty bottles and sticky\r\nglasses and cigar ends. In one corner stood the harp in its green cover.\r\n\r\nPablo asked the Fathers to be seated. His mistress was staying in bed,\r\nhe said, and the cook had burnt her hand, and the other maids were lazy.\r\nHe brought wood and laid a fire.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella entered, dressed in heavy mourning, her\r\nface very white against the black, and her eyes red. The curls about her\r\nneck and ears were pale, too--quite ashen.\r\n\r\nAfter Father Vaillant had greeted her and spoken: consoling words, the\r\nyoung lawyer began once more gently to explain to her the difficulties\r\nthat confronted them, and what they must do to defeat the action of the\r\nOlivares family. She sat submissively, touching her eyes and nose with\r\nher little lace handkerchief, and clearly not even trying to understand\r\na word of what he said to her.\r\n\r\nFather Joseph soon lost patience and himself approached the widow. "You\r\nunderstand, my child," he began briskly, "that your husband\'s brothers\r\nare determined to disregard his wishes, to defraud you and your\r\ndaughter, and, eventually, the Church. This is no time for childish\r\nvanity. To prevent this outrage to your husband\'s memory, you must\r\nsatisfy the court that you are old enough to be the mother of\r\nMademoiselle Inez. You must resolutely declare your true age;\r\nfifty-three, is it not?"\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Isabella became pallid with fright. She shrank into one end of the\r\ndeep sofa, but her blue eyes focused and gathered light, as she became\r\nintensely, rigidly animated in her corner,--her back against the wall,\r\nas it were.\r\n\r\n"Fifty-three!" she cried in a voice of horrified amazement. "Why, I\r\nnever heard of anything so outrageous! I was forty-two my last birthday.\r\nIt was in December, the fourth of December. If Antonio were here, he\r\nwould tell you! And he wouldn\'t let you scold me and talk about business\r\nto me, either, Father Joseph. He never let anybody talk about business\r\nto me!" She hid her face in her little handkerchief and began to cry.\r\n\r\nFather Latour checked his impetuous Vicar, and sat down on the sofa\r\nbeside Madame Olivares, feeling very sorry for her and speaking very\r\ngently. "Forty-two to your friends, dear Madame Olivares, and to the\r\nworld. In heart and face you are younger than that. But to the Law and\r\nthe Church there must be a literal reckoning. A formal statement in\r\ncourt will not make you any older to your friends; it will not add one\r\nline to your face. A woman, you know, is as old as she looks."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very sweet of you to say, Bishop Latour," the lady quavered,\r\nlooking up at him with tearbright eyes. "But I never could hold up my\r\nhead again. Let the Olivares have that old money. I don\'t want it."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant sprang up and glared down at her as if he could put\r\ncommon sense into her drooping head by the mere intensity of his gaze.\r\n"Four hundred thousand pesos, Se\xc3\xb1ora Isabella!" he cried. "Ease and\r\ncomfort for you and your daughter all the rest of your lives. Would you\r\nmake your daughter a beggar? The Olivares will take everything."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it about Inez," she pleaded. "Inez means to go into the\r\nconvent anyway. And I don\'t care about the money. _Ah, mon p\xc3\xa8re, je\r\nvoudrais mieux \xc3\xaatre jeune et mendiante, que n\'\xc3\xaatre que vieille et\r\nriche, certes, oui_!"\r\n\r\nFather Joseph caught her icy cold hand. "And have you a right to defraud\r\nthe Church of what is left to it in your trust? Have you thought of the\r\nconsequences to yourself of such a betrayal?"\r\n\r\nFather Latour glanced sternly at his Vicar. "_Assez_," he said quietly.\r\nHe took the little hand Father Joseph had released and bent over it,\r\nkissing it respectfully. "We must not press this any further. We must\r\nleave this to Madame Olivares and her own conscience. I believe, my\r\ndaughter, you will come to realize that this sacrifice of your vanity\r\nwould be for your soul\'s peace. Looking merely at the temporal aspect of\r\nthe case, you would find poverty hard to bear. You would have to live\r\nupon the Olivares\'s charity, would you not? I do not wish to see this\r\ncome about. I have a selfish interest; I wish you to be always your\r\ncharming self and to make a little _po\xc3\xa9sie_ in life for us here. We\r\nhave not much of that."\r\n\r\nMadame Olivares stopped crying. She raised her head and sat drying her\r\neyes. Suddenly she took hold of one of the buttons on the Bishop\'s\r\ncassock and began twisting it with nervous fingers.\r\n\r\n"Father," she said timidly, "what is the youngest I could possibly be,\r\nto be Inez\'s mother?"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop could not pronounce the verdict; he hesitated, flushed, then\r\npassed it on to O\'Reilly with an open gesture of his fine white hand.\r\n\r\n"Fifty-two, Se\xc3\xb1ora Olivares," said the young man respectfully. "If I\r\ncan get you to admit that, and stick to it, I feel sure we will win our\r\ncase."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Mr. O\'Reilly." She bowed her head. As her visitors rose, she\r\nsat looking down at the dust-covered rugs. "Before everybody!" she\r\nmurmured, as if to herself.\r\n\r\nWhen they were tramping home, Father Joseph said that as for him, he\r\nwould rather combat the superstitions of a whole Indian pueblo than the\r\nvanity of one white woman.\r\n\r\n"And I would rather do almost anything than go through such a scene\r\nagain," said the Bishop with a frown. "I don\'t think I ever assisted at\r\nanything so cruel."\r\n\r\n\r\nBoyd O\'Reilly defeated the Olivares brothers and won his case. The\r\nBishop would not go to the court hearing, but Father Vaillant was there,\r\nstanding in the malodorous crowd (there were no chairs in the court\r\nroom), and his knees shook under him when the young lawyer, with the\r\nfierceness born of fright, poked his finger at his client and said:\r\n\r\n"Se\xc3\xb1ora Olivares, you are fifty-two years of age, are you not?"\r\n\r\nMadame Olivares was swathed in mourning, her face a streak of shadowed\r\nwhite between folds of black veil.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir." The crape barely let it through.\r\n\r\nThe night after the verdict was pronounced, Manuel Chavez, with several\r\nof Antonio\'s old friends, called upon the widow to congratulate her.\r\nWord of their intention had gone about the town and put others in the\r\nmood to call at a house that had been closed to visitors for so long. A\r\nconsiderable company gathered there that evening, including some of the\r\nmilitary people, and several hereditary enemies of the Olivares\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nThe cook, stimulated by the sight of the long sala full of people once\r\nmore, hastily improvised a supper. Pablo put on a white shirt and a\r\nvelvet jacket, and began to carry up from the cellar his late master\'s\r\nbest whisky and sherry, and quarts of champagne. (The Mexicans are very\r\nfond of sparkling wines. Only a few years before this, an American\r\ntrader who had got into serious political trouble with the Mexican\r\nmilitary authorities in Santa F\xc3\xa9, regained their confidence and\r\nfriendship by presenting them with a large wagon shipment of\r\nchampagne--three thousand, three hundred and ninety-two bottles,\r\nindeed!)\r\n\r\nThis hospitable mood came upon the house suddenly, nothing had been\r\nprepared beforehand. The wineglasses were full of dust, but Pablo wiped\r\nthem out with the shirt he had just taken off, and without instructions\r\nfrom anyone he began gliding about with a tray full of glasses, which he\r\nafterward refilled many times, taking his station at the sideboard.\r\nEven Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella drank a little champagne; when she had sipped one\r\nglass with the young Georgia captain, she could not refuse to take\r\nanother with their nearest neighbour, Ferdinand Sanchez, always a true\r\nfriend to her husband. Everyone was gay, the servants and the guests,\r\neverything sparkled like a garden after a shower.\r\n\r\nFather Latour and Father Vaillant, having heard nothing of this\r\nspontaneous gathering of friends, set off at eight o\'clock to make a\r\ncall upon the brave widow. When they entered the courtyard, they were\r\nastonished to hear music within, and to see light streaming from the\r\nlong row of windows behind the _portale_. Without stopping to knock,\r\nthey opened the door into the _sala_. Many candles were burning. Se\xc3\xb1ors\r\nwere standing about in long frock-coats buttoned over full figures.\r\nO\'Reilly and a group of officers from the Fort surrounded the sideboard,\r\nwhere Pablo, with a white napkin wrapped showily about his wrist, was\r\npouring champagne. From the other end of the room sounded the high\r\ntinkle of the harp, and Do\xc3\xb1a Isabella\'s voice:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "_Listen to the mocking-bird_,\r\n     _Listen to the mocking-bird!_"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe priests waited in the doorway until the song was finished, then went\r\nforward to pay their respects to the hostess. She was wearing the\r\nunrelieved white that grief permitted, and the yellow curls were bobbing\r\nas of old--three behind her right ear, one over either temple, and a\r\nlittle row across the back of her neck. As she saw the two black figures\r\napproaching, she dropped her arms from the harp, took her satin toe from\r\nthe pedal, and rose, holding out a hand to each. Her eyes were bright,\r\nand her face beamed with affection for her spiritual fathers. But her\r\ngreeting was a playful reproach, uttered loud enough to be heard above\r\nthe murmur of conversing groups:\r\n\r\n"I never shall forgive you, Father Joseph, nor you either, Bishop\r\nLatour, for that awful lie you made me tell in court about my age!"\r\n\r\nThe two churchmen bowed amid laughter and applause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SEVEN\r\n\r\n_THE GREAT DIOCESE_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE MONTH OF MARY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Bishop\'s work was sometimes assisted, often impeded, by external\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nBy the Gadsden Purchase, executed three years after Father Latour came\r\nto Santa F\xc3\xa9, the United States took over from Mexico a great territory\r\nwhich now forms southern New Mexico and Arizona. The authorities at Rome\r\nnotified Father Latour that this new territory was to be annexed to his\r\ndiocese, but that as the national boundary lines often cut parishes in\r\ntwo, the boundaries of Church jurisdiction must be settled by conference\r\nwith the Mexican Bishops of Chihuahua and Sonora. Such conferences would\r\nnecessitate a journey of nearly four thousand miles. As Father Vaillant\r\nremarked, at Rome they did not seem to realize that it was no easy\r\nmatter for two missionaries on horseback to keep up with the march of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe question hung fire for some years, the subject of voluminous\r\ncorrespondence. At last, in 1858, Father Vaillant was sent to arrange\r\nthe debated boundaries with the Mexican Bishops. He started in the\r\nautumn and spent the whole winter on the road, going from El Paso del\r\nNorte west to Tucson, on to Santa Magdalena and Guaymas, a seaport town\r\non the Gulf of California, and did some seafaring on the Pacific before\r\nhe turned homeward.\r\n\r\nOn his return trip he was stricken with malarial fever, resulting from\r\nexposure and bad water, and lay seriously ill in a cactus desert in\r\nArizona. Word of his illness came to Santa F\xc3\xa9 by an Indian runner, and\r\nFather Latour and Jacinto rode across New Mexico and half of Arizona,\r\nfound Father Vaillant, and brought him back by easy stages.\r\n\r\nHe was ill in the Bishop\'s house for two months. This was the first\r\nspring that he and Father Latour had both been there at the same time,\r\nto enjoy the garden they had laid out soon after they first came to\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the month of Mary and the month of May. Father Vaillant was lying\r\non an army cot, covered with blankets, under the grape arbour in the\r\ngarden, watching the Bishop and his gardener at work in the vegetable\r\nplots. The apple trees were in blossom, the cherry blooms had gone by.\r\nThe air and the earth interpenetrated in the warm gusts of spring; the\r\nsoil was full of sunlight, and the sunlight full of red dust. The air\r\none breathed was saturated with earthy smells, and the grass under foot\r\nhad a reflection of blue sky in it.\r\n\r\nThis garden had been laid out six years ago, when the Bishop brought his\r\nfruit trees (then dry switches) up from St. Louis in wagons, along with\r\nthe blessed Sisters of Loretto, who came to found the Academy of Our\r\nLady of Light. The school was now well established, reckoned a benefit\r\nto the community by Protestants as well as Catholics, and the trees were\r\nbearing. Cuttings from them were already yielding fruit in many Mexican\r\ngardens. While the Bishop was away on that first trip to Baltimore,\r\nFather Joseph had, in addition to his many official duties, found time\r\nto instruct their Mexican housekeeper, Fructosa, in cookery. Later\r\nBishop Latour took in hand Fructosa\'s husband, Tranquilino, and trained\r\nhim as a gardener. They had boldly planned for the future; the ground\r\nbehind the church, between the Bishop\'s house and the Academy, they laid\r\nout as a spacious orchard and kitchen-garden. Ever since then the Bishop\r\nhad worked on it, planting and pruning. It was his only recreation.\r\n\r\nA line of young poplars linked the Episcopal courtyard with the school.\r\nOn the south, against the earth wall, was the one row of trees they had\r\nfound growing there when they first came,--old, old tamarisks, with\r\ntwisted trunks. They had been so neglected, left to fight for life in\r\nsuch hard, sun-baked, burro-trodden ground, that their trunks had the\r\nhardness of cypress. They looked, indeed, like very old posts, well\r\nseasoned and polished by time, miraculously endowed with the power to\r\nburst into delicate foliage and flowers, to cover themselves with long\r\nbrooms of lavender-pink blossom.\r\n\r\nFather Joseph had come to love the tamarisk above all trees. It had been\r\nthe companion of his wanderings. All along his way through the deserts\r\nof New Mexico and Arizona, wherever he had come upon a Mexican\r\nhomestead, out of the sun-baked earth, against the sun-baked adobe\r\nwalls, the tamarisk waved its feathery plumes of bluish green. The\r\nfamily burro was tied to its trunk, the chickens scratched under it, the\r\ndogs slept in its shade, the washing was hung on its branches. Father\r\nLatour had often remarked that this tree seemed especially designed in\r\nshape and colour for the adobe village. The sprays of bloom which adorn\r\nit are merely another shade of the red earth walls, and its fibrous\r\ntrunk is full of gold and lavender tints. Father Joseph respected the\r\nBishop\'s eye for such things, but himself he loved it merely because it\r\nwas the tree of the people, and was like one of the family in every\r\nMexican household.\r\n\r\nThis was a very happy season for Father Vaillant. For years he had not\r\nbeen able properly to observe this month which in his boyhood he had\r\nselected to be the holy month of the year for him, dedicated to the\r\ncontemplation of his Gracious Patroness. In his former missionary life,\r\non the Great Lakes, he used always to go into retreat at this season.\r\nBut here there was no time for such things. Last year, in May, he had\r\nbeen on his way to the Hopi Indians, riding thirty miles a day;\r\nmarrying, baptizing, confessing as he went, making camp in the\r\nsand-hills at night. His devotions had been constantly interrupted by\r\npractical considerations.\r\n\r\nBut this year, because of his illness, the month of Mary he had been\r\nable to give to Mary; to Her he had consecrated his waking hours. At\r\nnight he sank to sleep with the sense of Her protection. In the morning\r\nwhen he awoke, before he had opened his eyes, he was conscious of a\r\nspecial sweetness in the air,--Mary, and the month of May. _Alma Mater\r\nredemptoris_! Once more he had been able to worship with the ardour of a\r\nyoung religious, for whom religion is pure personal devotion, unalloyed\r\nby expediency and the benumbing cares of a missionary\'s work. Once again\r\nthis had been his month; his Patroness had given it to him, the season\r\nthat had always meant so much in his religious life.\r\n\r\nHe smiled to remember a time long ago, when he was a young curate in\r\nCendre, in the Puy-de-D\xc3\xb4m; how he had planned a season of special\r\ndevotion to the Blessed Virgin for May, and how the old priest to whom\r\nhe was assistant had blasted his hopes by cold disapproval. The old man\r\nhad come through the Terror, had been trained in the austerity of those\r\ndays of the persecution of the clergy, and he was not untouched by\r\nJansenism. Young Father Joseph bore his rebuke with meekness, and went\r\nsadly to his own chamber. There he took his rosary and spent the entire\r\nday in prayer. "_Not according to my desires, but if it is for thy\r\nglory, grant me this boon, O Mary, my hope_." In the evening of that\r\nsame day the old pastor sent for him, and unsolicited granted him the\r\nrequest he had so sternly denied in the morning. How joyfully Father\r\nJoseph had written all this to his sister Philom\xc3\xa8ne, then a pupil with\r\nthe nuns of the Visitation in their native Riom, begging her to make him\r\na quantity of artificial flowers for his May altar. How richly she had\r\nresponded!--and she rejoiced no less than he that his May devotions were\r\nso largely attended, especially by the young people of the parish, in\r\nwhom a notable increase of piety was manifest. Father Vaillant\'s had\r\nbeen a close-knit family--losing their mother while they were yet\r\nchildren had brought the brothers and sisters the closer together--and\r\nwith this sister, Philom\xc3\xa8ne, he had shared all his hopes and desires\r\nand his deepest religious life.\r\n\r\nEver since then, all the most important events in his own history had\r\noccurred in the blessed month when this sinful and sullied world puts on\r\nwhite as if to commemorate the Annunciation, and becomes, for a little,\r\nlovely enough to be in truth the Bride of Christ. It was in May that he\r\nhad been given grace to perform the hardest act of his life; to leave\r\nhis country, to part from his dear sister and his father (under what sad\r\ncircumstances!), and to start for the New World to take up a\r\nmissionary\'s labours. That parting was not a parting, but an escape--a\r\nrunning away, a betrayal of family trust for the sake of a higher trust.\r\nHe could smile at it now, but at the time it had been terrible enough.\r\nThe Bishop, thinning carrots yonder, would remember. It was because of\r\nwhat Father Latour had been to him in that hour, indeed, that Father\r\nJoseph was here in a garden in Santa F\xc3\xa9. He would never have left his\r\ndear Sandusky when the newly appointed Bishop asked him to share his\r\nhardships, had he not said to himself: "Ah, now it is he who is torn by\r\nperplexity! I will be to him now what he was to me that day when we\r\nstood by the road-side, waiting for the _diligence_ to Paris, and my\r\npurpose broke, and he saved me."\r\n\r\nThat time came back upon Father Vaillant now so keenly that he wiped a\r\nlittle moisture from his eyes,--(he was quickly moved, after the way of\r\nsick people) and he cleared his glasses and called:\r\n\r\n"Father Latour, it is time for you to rest your back. You have been\r\nstooping over a great while."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop came and sat down in a wheelbarrow that stood at the edge of\r\nthe arbour.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking that I shall no longer pray for your speedy\r\nrecovery, Joseph. The only way I can keep my Vicar within call is to\r\nhave him sick."\r\n\r\nFather Joseph smiled.\r\n\r\n"You are not in Santa F\xc3\xa9 a great deal yourself, my Bishop."\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall be here this summer, and I hope to keep you with me. This\r\nyear I want you to see my lotus flowers. Tranquilino will let the water\r\ninto my lake this afternoon." The lake was a little pond in the middle\r\nof the garden, into which Tranquilino, clever with water, like all\r\nMexicans, had piped a stream from the Santa F\xc3\xa9 creek flowing near at\r\nhand. "Last summer, while you were away," the Bishop continued, "we had\r\nmore than a hundred lotus blossoms floating on that little lake. And all\r\nfrom five bulbs that I put into my valise in Rome."\r\n\r\n"When do they blossom?"\r\n\r\n"They begin in June, but they are at their best in July."\r\n\r\n"Then you must hurry them up a little. For with my Bishop\'s permission,\r\nI shall be gone in July."\r\n\r\n"So soon? And why?"\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant moved uneasily under his blankets. "To hunt for lost\r\nCatholics, Jean! Utterly lost Catholics, down in your new territory,\r\ntowards Tucson. There are hundreds of poor families down there who have\r\nnever seen a priest. I want to go from house to house this time, to\r\nevery little settlement. They are full of devotion and faith, and it has\r\nnothing to feed upon but the most mistaken superstitions. They remember\r\ntheir prayers all wrong. They cannot read, and since there is no one to\r\ninstruct them, how can they get right? They are like seeds, full of\r\ngermination but with no moisture. A mere contact is enough to make them\r\na living part of the Church. The more I work with the Mexicans, the more\r\nI believe it was people like them our Saviour bore in mind when He said,\r\n_Unless ye become as little children_. He was thinking of people who are\r\nnot clever in the things of this world, whose minds are not upon gain\r\nand worldly advancement. These poor Christians are not thrifty like our\r\ncountry people at home; they have no veneration for property, no sense\r\nof material values. I stop a few hours in a village, I administer the\r\nsacraments and hear confessions, I leave in every house some little\r\ntoken, a rosary or a religious picture, and I go away feeling that I\r\nhave conferred immeasurable happiness, and have released faithful souls\r\nthat were shut away from God by neglect.\r\n\r\n"Down near Tucson a Pima Indian convert once asked me to go off into the\r\ndesert with him, as he had something to show me. He took me into a place\r\nso wild that a man less accustomed to these things might have mistrusted\r\nand feared for his life. We descended into a terrifying canyon of black\r\nrock, and there in the depths of a cave, he showed me a golden chalice,\r\nvestments and cruets, all the paraphernalia for celebrating Mass. His\r\nancestors had hidden these sacred objects there when the mission was\r\nsacked by Apaches, he did not know how many generations ago. The secret\r\nhad been handed down in his family, and I was the first priest who had\r\never come to restore to God his own. To me, that is the situation in a\r\nparable. The Faith, in that wild frontier, is like a buried treasure;\r\nthey guard it, but they do not know how to use it to their soul\'s\r\nsalvation. A word, a prayer, a service, is all that is needed to set\r\nfree those souls in bondage. I confess I am covetous of that mission. I\r\ndesire to be the man who restores these lost children to God. It will be\r\nthe greatest happiness of my life."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop did not reply at once to this appeal. At last he said\r\ngravely, "You must realize that I have need of you here, Father Joseph.\r\nMy duties are too many for one man."\r\n\r\n"But you do not need me so much as they do!" Father Joseph threw off his\r\ncoverings and sat up in his cassock, putting his feet to the ground.\r\n"Any one of our good French priests from Montferrand can serve you here.\r\nIt is work that can be done by intelligence. But down there it is work\r\nfor the heart, for a particular sympathy, and none of our new priests\r\nunderstand those poor natures as I do. I have almost become a Mexican! I\r\nhave learned to like _chili colorado_ and mutton fat. Their foolish ways\r\nno longer offend me, their very faults are dear to me. I am _their\r\nman_!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, no doubt, no doubt! But I must insist upon your lying down for the\r\npresent."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant, flushed and excited, dropped back upon his pillows, and\r\nthe Bishop took a short turn through the garden,--to the row of tamarisk\r\ntrees and back. He walked slowly, with even, unhesitating pace, with\r\nthat slender, unrigid erectness, and the fine carriage of head, which\r\nalways made him seem master of the situation. No one would have guessed\r\nthat a sharp struggle was going on within him. Father Joseph\'s\r\nimpassioned request had spoiled a cherished plan, and brought Father\r\nLatour a bitter personal disappointment. There was but one thing to\r\ndo,--and before he reached the tamarisks he had done it. He broke off a\r\nspray of the dry lilac-coloured flowers to punctuate and seal, as it\r\nwere, his renunciation. He returned with the same easy, deliberate\r\ntread, and stood smiling beside the army cot.\r\n\r\n"Your feeling must be your guide in this matter, Joseph. I shall put no\r\nobstacles in your way. A certain care for your health I must insist\r\nupon, but when you are quite well, you must follow the duty that calls\r\nloudest."\r\n\r\nThey were both silent for a few moments. Father Joseph closed his eyes\r\nagainst the sunlight, and Father Latour stood lost in thought, drawing\r\nthe plume of tamarisk blossom absently through his delicate, rather\r\nnervous fingers. His hands had a curious authority, but not the calmness\r\nso often seen in the hands of priests; they seemed always to be\r\ninvestigating and making firm decisions.\r\n\r\nThe two friends were roused from their reflections by a frantic beating\r\nof wings. A bright flock of pigeons swept over their heads to the far\r\nend of the garden, where a woman was just emerging from the gate that\r\nled into the school grounds; Magdalena, who came every day to feed the\r\ndoves and to gather flowers. The Sisters had given her charge of the\r\naltar decoration of the school chapel for this month, and she came for\r\nthe Bishop\'s apple blossoms and daffodils. She advanced in a whirlwind\r\nof gleaming wings, and Tranquilino dropped his spade and stood watching\r\nher. At one moment the whole flock of doves caught the light in such a\r\nway that they all became invisible at once, dissolved in light and\r\ndisappeared as salt dissolves in water. The next moment they flashed\r\naround, black and silver against the sun. They settled upon Magdalena\'s\r\narms and shoulders, ate from her hand. When she put a crust of bread\r\nbetween her lips, two doves hung in the air before her face, stirring\r\ntheir wings and pecking at the morsel. A handsome woman she had grown to\r\nbe, with her comely figure and the deep claret colour under the golden\r\nbrown of her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Who would think, to look at her now, that we took her from a place\r\nwhere every vileness of cruelty and lust was practised!" murmured Father\r\nVaillant. "Not since the days of early Christianity has the Church been\r\nable to do what it can here."\r\n\r\n"She is but twenty-seven or -eight years old. I wonder whether she ought\r\nnot to marry again," said the Bishop thoughtfully. "Though she seems so\r\ncontented, I have sometimes surprised a tragic shadow in her eyes. Do\r\nyou remember the terrible look in her eyes when we first saw her?"\r\n\r\n"Can I ever forget it! But her very body has changed. She was then a\r\nshapeless, cringing creature. I thought her half-witted. No, no! She has\r\nhad enough of the storms of this world. Here she is safe and happy."\r\nFather Vaillant sat up and called to her. "Magdalena, Magdalena, my\r\nchild, come here and talk to us for a little. Two men grow lonely when\r\nthey see nobody but each other."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nDECEMBER NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER VAILLANT had been absent in Arizona since midsummer, and it was\r\nnow December. Bishop Latour had been going through one of those periods\r\nof coldness and doubt which, from his boyhood, had occasionally settled\r\ndown upon his spirit and made him feel an alien, wherever he was. He\r\nattended to his correspondence, went on his rounds among the parish\r\npriests, held services at missions that were without pastors,\r\nsuperintended the building of the addition to the Sisters\' school: but\r\nhis heart was not in these things.\r\n\r\nOne night about three weeks before Christmas he was lying in his bed,\r\nunable to sleep, with the sense of failure clutching at his heart. His\r\nprayers were empty words and brought him no refreshment. His soul had\r\nbecome a barren field. He had nothing within himself to give his priests\r\nor his people. His work seemed superficial, a house built upon the\r\nsands. His great diocese was still a heathen country. The Indians\r\ntravelled their old road of fear and darkness, battling with evil omens\r\nand ancient shadows. The Mexicans were children who played with their\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on, the bed on which the Bishop lay became a bed of\r\nthorns; he could bear it no longer. Getting up in the dark, he looked\r\nout of the window and was surprised to find that it was snowing, that\r\nthe ground was already lightly covered. The full moon, hidden by veils\r\nof cloud, threw a pale phosphorescent luminousness over the heavens, and\r\nthe towers of the church stood up black against this silvery fleece.\r\nFather Latour felt a longing to go into the church to pray; but instead\r\nhe lay down again under his blankets. Then, realizing that it was the\r\ncold of the church he shrank from, and despising himself, he rose again,\r\ndressed quickly, and went out into the court, throwing on over his\r\ncassock that faithful old cloak that was the twin of Father Vaillant\'s.\r\n\r\nThey had bought the cloth for those coats in Paris, long ago, when they\r\nwere young men staying at the Seminary for Foreign Missions in the rue\r\ndu Bac, preparing for their first voyage to the New World. The cloth had\r\nbeen made up into caped riding-cloaks by a German tailor in Ohio, and\r\nlined with fox fur. Years afterward, when Father Latour was about to\r\nstart on his long journey in search of his Bishopric, that same tailor\r\nhad made the cloaks over and relined them with squirrel skins, as more\r\nappropriate for a mild climate. These memories and many others went\r\nthrough the Bishop\'s mind as he wrapped the trusty garment about him and\r\ncrossed the court to the sacristy, with the big iron key in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe court was white with snow, and the shadows of walls and buildings\r\nstood out sharply in the faint light from the moon muffled in vapour. In\r\nthe deep doorway of the sacristy he saw a crouching figure--a woman, he\r\nmade out, and she was weeping bitterly. He raised her up and took her\r\ninside. As soon as he had lit a candle, he recognized her, and could\r\nhave guessed her errand.\r\n\r\nIt was an old Mexican woman, called Sada, who was slave in an American\r\nfamily. They were Protestants, very hostile to the Roman Church, and\r\nthey did not allow her to go to Mass or to receive the visits of a\r\npriest. She was carefully watched at home,--but in winter, when the\r\nheated rooms of the house were desirable to the family, she was put to\r\nsleep in a woodshed. To-night, unable to sleep for the cold, she had\r\ngathered courage for this heroic action, had slipped out through the\r\nstable door and come running up an alley-way to the House of God to\r\npray. Finding the front doors of the church fastened, she had made her\r\nway into the Bishop\'s garden and come round to the sacristy, only to\r\nfind that, too, shut against her.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop stood holding the candle and watching her face while she\r\nspoke her few words; a dark brown peon face, worn thin and sharp by life\r\nand sorrow. It seemed to him that he had never seen pure goodness shine\r\nout of a human countenance as it did from hers. He saw that she had no\r\nstockings under her shoes,--the cast-off rawhides of her master,--and\r\nbeneath her frayed black shawl was only a thin calico dress, covered\r\nwith patches. Her teeth struck together as she stood trying to control\r\nher shivering. With one movement of his free hand the Bishop took the\r\nfurred cloak from his shoulders and put it about her. This frightened\r\nher. She cowered under it, murmuring, "Ah, no, no, Padre!"\r\n\r\n"You must obey your Padre, my daughter. Draw that cloak about you, and\r\nwe will go into the church to pray."\r\n\r\nThe church was utterly black except for the red spark of the sanctuary\r\nlamp before the high altar. Taking her hand, and holding the candle\r\nbefore him, he led her across the choir to the Lady Chapel. There he\r\nbegan to light the tapers before the Virgin. Old Sada fell on her knees\r\nand kissed the floor. She kissed the feet of the Holy Mother, the\r\npedestal on which they stood, crying all the while. But from the working\r\nof her face, from the beautiful tremors which passed over it, he knew\r\nthey were tears of ecstasy.\r\n\r\n"Nineteen years, Father; nineteen years since I have seen the holy\r\nthings of the altar!"\r\n\r\n"All that is passed, Sada. You have remembered the holy things in your\r\nheart. We will pray together."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop knelt beside her, and they began, _O Holy Mary, Queen of\r\nVirgins_....\r\n\r\nMore than once Father Vaillant had spoken to the Bishop of this aged\r\ncaptive. There had been much whispering among the devout women of the\r\nparish about her pitiful case. The Smiths, with whom she lived, were\r\nGeorgia people, who had at one time lived in El Paso del Norte, and they\r\nhad taken her back to their native State with them. Not long ago some\r\ndisgrace had come upon this family in Georgia, they had been forced to\r\nsell all their negro slaves and flee the State. The Mexican woman they\r\ncould not sell because they had no legal title to her, her position was\r\nirregular. Now that they were back in a Mexican country, the Smiths were\r\nafraid their charwoman might escape from them and find asylum among her\r\nown people, so they kept strict watch upon her. They did not allow her\r\nto go outside their own _patio_, not even to accompany her mistress to\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nTwo women of the Altar Guild had been so bold as to go into the _patio_\r\nto talk with Sada when she was washing clothes, but they had been rudely\r\ndriven away by the mistress of the house. Mrs. Smith had come running\r\nout into the court, half dressed, and told them that if they had\r\nbusiness at her _casa_ they were to come in by the front door, and not\r\nsneak in through the stable to frighten a poor silly creature. When they\r\nsaid they had come to ask Sada to go to Mass with them, she told them\r\nshe had got the poor creature out of the clutches of the priests once,\r\nand would see to it that she did not fall into them again.\r\n\r\nEven after that rebuff a very pious neighbour woman had tried to say a\r\nword to Sada through the alley door of the stable, where she was\r\nunloading wood off the burro. But the old servant had put her finger to\r\nher lips and motioned the visitor away, glancing back over her shoulder\r\nthe while with such an expression of terror that the intruder hastened\r\noff, surmising that Sada would be harshly used if she were caught\r\nspeaking to anyone. The good woman went immediately to Father Vaillant\r\nwith this story, and he had consulted the Bishop, declaring that\r\nsomething ought to be done to secure the consolations of religion for\r\nthe bond-woman. But the Bishop replied that the time was not yet; for\r\nthe present it was inexpedient to antagonize these people. The Smiths\r\nwere the leaders of a small group of low-caste Protestants who took\r\nevery occasion to make trouble for the Catholics. They hung about the\r\ndoor of the church on festival days with mockery and loud laughter,\r\nspoke insolently to the nuns in the street, stood jeering and\r\nblaspheming when the procession went by on Corpus Christi Sunday. There\r\nwere five sons in the Smith family, fellows of low habits and evil\r\ntongues. Even the two younger boys, still children, showed a vicious\r\ndisposition. Tranquilino had repeatedly driven these two boys out of the\r\nBishop\'s garden, where they came with their lewd companions to rob the\r\nyoung pear trees or to speak filth against the priests.\r\n\r\nWhen they rose from their knees, Father Latour told Sada he was glad to\r\nknow that she remembered her prayers so well.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Padre, every night I say my Rosary to my Holy Mother, no matter\r\nwhere I sleep!" declared the old creature passionately, looking up into\r\nhis face and pressing her knotted hands against her breast.\r\n\r\nWhen he asked if she had her beads with her, she was confused. She kept\r\nthem tied with a cord around her waist, under her clothes, as the only\r\nplace she could hide them safely.\r\n\r\nHe spoke soothingly to her. "Remember this, Sada; in the year to come,\r\nand during the Novena before Christmas, I will not forget to pray for\r\nyou whenever I offer the Blessed Sacrament of the Mass. Be at rest in\r\nyour heart, for I will remember you in my silent supplications before\r\nthe altar as I do my own sisters and my nieces."\r\n\r\nNever, as he afterward told Father Vaillant, had it been permitted him\r\nto behold such deep experience of the holy joy of religion as on that\r\npale December night. He was able to feel, kneeling beside her, the\r\npreciousness of the things of the altar to her who was without\r\npossessions; the tapers, the image of the Virgin, the figures of the\r\nsaints, the Cross that took away indignity from suffering and made pain\r\nand poverty a means of fellowship with Christ. Kneeling beside the much\r\nenduring bondwoman, he experienced those holy mysteries as he had done\r\nin his young manhood. He seemed able to feel all it meant to her to know\r\nthat there was a Kind Woman in Heaven, though there were such cruel ones\r\non earth. Old people, who have felt blows and toil and known the world\'s\r\nhard hand, need, even more than children do, a woman\'s tenderness. Only\r\na Woman, divine, could know all that a woman can suffer.\r\n\r\nNot often, indeed, had Jean Marie Latour come so near to the Fountain of\r\nall Pity as in the Lady Chapel that night; the pity that no man born of\r\nwoman could ever utterly cut himself off from; that was for the murderer\r\non the scaffold, as it was for the dying soldier or the martyr on the\r\nrack. The beautiful concept of Mary pierced the priest\'s heart like a\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n"_O Sacred Heart of Mary_!" she murmured by his side, and he felt how\r\nthat name was food and raiment, friend and mother to her. He received\r\nthe miracle in her heart into his own, saw through her eyes, knew that\r\nhis poverty was as bleak as hers. When the Kingdom of Heaven had first\r\ncome into the world, into a cruel world of torture and slaves and\r\nmasters, He who brought it had said, "_And whosoever is least among you,\r\nthe same shall be first in the Kingdom of Heaven_." This church was\r\nSada\'s house, and he was a servant in it.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop heard the old woman\'s confession. He blessed her and put both\r\nhands upon her head. When he took her down the nave to let her out of\r\nthe church, Sada made to lift his cloak from her shoulders. He\r\nrestrained her, telling her she must keep it for her own, and sleep in\r\nit at night. But she slipped out of it hurriedly; such a thought seemed\r\nto terrify her. "No, no, Father. If they were to find it on me!" More\r\nthan that, she did not accuse her oppressors. But as she put it off, she\r\nstroked the old garment and patted it as if it were a living thing that\r\nhad been kind to her.\r\n\r\nHappily Father Latour bethought him of a little silver medal, with a\r\nfigure of the Virgin, he had in his pocket. He gave it to her, telling\r\nher that it had been blessed by the Holy Father himself. Now she would\r\nhave a treasure to hide and guard, to adore while her watchers slept.\r\nAh, he thought, for one who cannot read--or think--the Image, the\r\nphysical form of Love!\r\n\r\nHe fitted the great key into its lock, the door swung slowly back on its\r\nwooden hinges. The peace without seemed all one with the peace in his\r\nown soul. The snow had stopped, the gauzy clouds that had ribbed the\r\narch of heaven were now all sunk into one soft white fog bank over the\r\nSangre de Cristo mountains. The full moon shone high in the blue vault,\r\nmajestic, lonely, benign. The Bishop stood in the doorway of his church,\r\nlost in thought, looking at the line of black footprints his departing\r\nvisitor had left in the wet scurf of snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nSPRING IN THE NAVAJO COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER VAILLANT was away in Arizona all winter. When the first hint of\r\nspring was in the air, the Bishop and Jacinto set out on a long ride\r\nacross New Mexico, to the Painted Desert and the Hopi villages. After\r\nthey left Oraibi, the Bishop rode several days to the south, to visit a\r\nNavajo friend who had lately lost his only son, and who had paid the\r\nBishop the compliment of sending word of the boy\'s death to him at Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nFather Latour had known Eusabio a long while, had met him soon after he\r\nfirst came to his new diocese. The Navajo was in Santa F\xc3\xa9 at that time,\r\nassisting the military officers to quiet an outbreak of the never-ending\r\nquarrel between his people and the Hopis. Ever since then the Bishop and\r\nthe Indian chief had entertained an increasing regard for each other.\r\nEusabio brought his son all the way to Santa F\xc3\xa9 to have the Bishop\r\nbaptize him,--that one beloved son who had died during this last winter.\r\n\r\nThough he was ten years younger than Father Latour, Eusabio was one of\r\nthe most influential men among the Navajo people, and one of the richest\r\nin sheep and horses. In Santa F\xc3\xa9 and Albuquerque he was respected for\r\nhis intelligence and authority, and admired for his fine presence. He\r\nwas extremely tall, even for a Navajo, with a face like a Roman\r\ngeneral\'s of Republican times. He always dressed very elegantly in\r\nvelvet and buckskin rich with bead and quill embroidery, belted with\r\nsilver, and wore a blanket of the finest wool and design. His arms,\r\nunder the loose sleeves of his shirt, were covered with silver\r\nbracelets, and on his breast hung very old necklaces of wampum and\r\nturquoise and coral--Mediterranean coral, that had been left in the\r\nNavajo country by Coronado\'s captains when they passed through it on\r\ntheir way to discover the Hopi villages and the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nEusabio lived, with his relatives and dependents, in a group of hogans\r\non the Colorado Chiquito; to the west and south and north his kinsmen\r\nherded his great flocks.\r\n\r\nFather Latour and Jacinto arrived at the cluster of booth-like cabins\r\nduring a high sand-storm, which circled about them and their mules like\r\nsnow in a blizzard and all but obliterated the landscape. The Navajo\r\ncame out of his house and took possession of Angelica by her bridle-bit.\r\nAt first he did not open his lips, merely stood holding Father Latour\'s\r\nvery fine white hand in his very fine dark one, and looked into his face\r\nwith a message of sorrow and resignation in his deep-set, eagle eyes. A\r\nwave of feeling passed over his bronze features as he said slowly:\r\n\r\n"My friend has come."\r\n\r\nThat was all, but it was everything; welcome, confidence, appreciation.\r\n\r\nFor his lodging the Bishop was given a solitary hogan, a little apart\r\nfrom the settlement. Eusabio quickly furnished it with his best skins\r\nand blankets, and told his guest that he must tarry a few days there and\r\nrecover from his fatigue. His mules were tired, the Indian said, the\r\nPadre himself looked weary, and the way to Santa F\xc3\xa9 was long.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop thanked him and said he would stay three days; that he had\r\nneed for reflection. His mind had been taken up with practical matters\r\never since he left home. This seemed a spot where a man might get his\r\nthoughts together. The river, a considerable stream at this time of the\r\nyear, wound among mounds and dunes of loose sand which whirled through\r\nthe air all day in the boisterous spring winds. The sand banked up\r\nagainst the hogan the Bishop occupied, and filtered through chinks in\r\nthe walls, which were made of saplings plastered with clay.\r\n\r\nBeside the river was a grove of tall, naked cottonwoods--trees of great\r\nantiquity and enormous size--so large that they seemed to belong to a\r\nbygone age. They grew far apart, and their strange twisted shapes must\r\nhave come about from the ceaseless winds that bent them to the east and\r\nscoured them with sand, and from the fact that they lived with very\r\nlittle water,--the river was nearly dry here for most of the year. The\r\ntrees rose out of the ground at a slant, and forty or fifty feet above\r\nthe earth all these white, dry trunks changed their direction, grew back\r\nover their base line. Some split into great forks which arched down\r\nalmost to the ground; some did not fork at all, but the main trunk\r\ndipped downward in a strong curve, as if drawn by a bowstring; and some\r\nterminated in a thick coruscation of growth, like a crooked palm tree.\r\nThey were all living trees, yet they seemed to be of old, dead, dry\r\nwood, and had very scant foliage. High up in the forks, or at the end of\r\na preposterous length of twisted bough, would burst a faint bouquet of\r\ndelicate green leaves--out of all keeping with the great lengths of\r\nseasoned white trunk and branches. The grove looked like a winter wood\r\nof giant trees, with clusters of mistletoe growing among the bare\r\nboughs.\r\n\r\nNavajo hospitality is not intrusive. Eusabio made the Bishop understand\r\nthat he was glad to have him there, and let him alone. Father Latour\r\nlived for three days in an almost perpetual sand-storm--cut off from\r\neven this remote little Indian camp by moving walls and tapestries of\r\nsand. He either sat in his house and listened to the wind, or walked\r\nabroad under those aged, wind-distorted trees, muffled in an Indian\r\nblanket, which he kept drawn up over his mouth and nose. Since his\r\narrival he had undertaken to decide whether he would be justified in\r\nrecalling Father Vaillant from Tucson. The Vicar\'s occasional letters,\r\nbrought by travellers, showed that he was highly content where he was,\r\nrestoring the old mission church of St. Xavier del Bac, which he\r\ndeclared to be the most beautiful church on the continent, though it had\r\nbeen neglected for more than two hundred years.\r\n\r\nSince Father Vaillant went away the Bishop\'s burdens had grown heavier\r\nand heavier. The new priests from Auvergne were all good men, faithful\r\nand untiring in carrying out his wishes; but they were still strangers\r\nto the country, timid about making decisions, and referred every\r\ndifficulty to their Bishop. Father Latour needed his Vicar, who had so\r\nmuch tact with the natives, so much sympathy with all their\r\nshort-comings. When they were together, he was always curbing Father\r\nVaillant\'s hopeful rashness--but left alone, he greatly missed that very\r\nquality. And he missed Father Vaillant\'s companionship--why not admit\r\nit?\r\n\r\nAlthough Jean Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant were born in neighbouring\r\nparishes in the Puy-de-D\xc3\xb4m, as children they had not known each other.\r\nThe Latours were an old family of scholars and professional men, while\r\nthe Vaillants were people of a much humbler station in the provincial\r\nworld. Besides, little Joseph had been away from home much of the time,\r\nup on the farm in the Volvic mountains with his grandfather, where the\r\nair was especially pure, and the country quiet salutary for a child of\r\nnervous temperament. The two boys had not come together until they were\r\nSeminarians at Montferrand, in Clermont.\r\n\r\nWhen Jean Marie was in his second year at the Seminary, he was standing\r\non the recreation ground one day at the opening of the term, looking\r\nwith curiosity at the new students. In the group, he noticed one of\r\npeculiarly unpromising appearance; a boy of nineteen who was undersized,\r\nvery pale, homely in feature, with a wart on his chin and tow-coloured\r\nhair that made him look like a German. This boy seemed to feel his\r\nglance, and came up at once, as if he had been called. He was apparently\r\nquite unconscious of his homeliness, was not at all shy, but intensely\r\ninterested in his new surroundings. He asked Jean Latour his name, where\r\nhe came from, and his father\'s occupation. Then he said with great\r\nsimplicity:\r\n\r\n"My father is a baker, the best in Riom. In fact, he\'s a remarkable\r\nbaker."\r\n\r\nYoung Latour was amused, but expressed polite appreciation of this\r\nconfidence. The queer lad went on to tell him about his brother and his\r\naunt, and his clever little sister, Philom\xc3\xa8ne. He asked how long Latour\r\nhad been at the Seminary.\r\n\r\n"Have you always intended to take orders? So have I, but I very nearly\r\nwent into the army instead."\r\n\r\nThe year previous, after the surrender of Algiers, there had been a\r\nmilitary review at Clermont, a great display of uniforms and military\r\nbands, and stirring speeches about the glory of French arms. Young\r\nJoseph Vaillant had lost his head in the excitement, and had signed up\r\nfor a volunteer without consulting his father. He gave Latour a vivid\r\naccount of his patriotic emotions, of his father\'s displeasure, and his\r\nown subsequent remorse. His mother had wished him to become a priest.\r\nShe died when he was thirteen, and ever since then he had meant to carry\r\nout her wish and to dedicate his life to the service of the Divine\r\nMother. But that one day, among the bands and the uniforms, he had\r\nforgotten everything but his desire to serve France.\r\n\r\nSuddenly young Vaillant broke off, saying that he must write a letter\r\nbefore the hour was over, and tucking up his gown he ran away at full\r\nspeed. Latour stood looking after him, resolved that he would take this\r\nnew boy under his protection. There was something about the baker\'s son\r\nthat had given their meeting the colour of an adventure; he meant to\r\nrepeat it. In that first encounter, he chose the lively, ugly boy for\r\nhis friend. It was instantaneous. Latour himself was much cooler and\r\nmore critical in temper; hard to please, and often a little grey in\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nDuring their Seminary years he had easily surpassed his friend in\r\nscholarship, but he always realized that Joseph excelled him in the\r\nfervour of his faith. After they became missionaries, Joseph had learned\r\nto speak English, and later, Spanish, more readily than he. To be sure,\r\nhe spoke both languages very incorrectly at first, but he had no vanity\r\nabout grammar or refinement of phrase. To communicate with peons, he was\r\nquite willing to speak like a peon.\r\n\r\nThough the Bishop had worked with Father Joseph for twenty-five years\r\nnow, he could not reconcile the contradictions of his nature. He simply\r\naccepted them, and, when Joseph had been away for a long while, realized\r\nthat he loved them all. His Vicar was one of the most truly spiritual\r\nmen he had ever known, though he was so passionately attached to many of\r\nthe things of this world. Fond as he was of good eating and drinking, he\r\nnot only rigidly observed all the fasts of the Church, but he never\r\ncomplained about the hardness and scantiness of the fare on his long\r\nmissionary journeys. Father Joseph\'s relish for good wine might have\r\nbeen a fault in another man. But always frail in body, he seemed to need\r\nsome quick physical stimulant to support his sudden flights of purpose\r\nand imagination. Time and again the Bishop had seen a good dinner, a\r\nbottle of claret, transformed into spiritual energy under his very eyes.\r\nFrom a little feast that would make other men heavy and desirous of\r\nrepose, Father Vaillant would rise up revived, and work for ten or\r\ntwelve hours with that ardour and thoroughness which accomplished such\r\nlasting results.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had often been embarrassed by his Vicar\'s persistence in\r\nbegging for the parish, for the Cathedral fund and the distant missions.\r\nYet for himself, Father Joseph was scarcely acquisitive to the point of\r\ndecency. He owned nothing in the world but his mule, Contento. Though he\r\nreceived rich vestments from his sister in Riom, his daily apparel was\r\nrough and shabby. The Bishop had a large and valuable library, at least,\r\nand many comforts for his house. There were his beautiful skins and\r\nblankets--presents from Eusabio and his other Indian friends. The\r\nMexican women, skilled in needlework and lace-making and hem-stitching,\r\npresented him with fine linen for his person, his bed, and his table. He\r\nhad silver plate, given him by the Olivares and others of his rich\r\nparishioners. But Father Vaillant was like the saints of the early\r\nChurch, literally without personal possessions.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, Joseph had wished to lead a life of seclusion and solitary\r\ndevotion; but the truth was, he could not be happy for long without\r\nhuman intercourse. And he liked almost everyone. In Ohio, when they used\r\nto travel together in stagecoaches, Father Latour had noticed that every\r\ntime a new passenger pushed his way into the already crowded stage,\r\nJoseph would look pleased and interested, as if this were an agreeable\r\naddition--whereas he himself felt annoyed, even if he concealed it. The\r\nugly conditions of life in Ohio had never troubled Joseph. The hideous\r\nhouses and churches, the ill-kept farms and gardens, the slovenly,\r\nsordid aspect of the towns and country-side, which continually depressed\r\nFather Latour, he seemed scarcely to perceive. One would have said he\r\nhad no feeling for comeliness or grace. Yet music was a passion with\r\nhim. In Sandusky it had been his delight to spend evening after evening\r\nwith his German choir-master, training the young people to sing Bach\r\noratorios.\r\n\r\nNothing one could say of Father Vaillant explained him. The man was much\r\ngreater than the sum of his qualities. He added a glow to whatever kind\r\nof human society he was dropped down into. A Navajo hogan, some abjectly\r\npoor little huddle of Mexican huts, or a company of Monsignori and\r\nCardinals at Rome--it was all the same.\r\n\r\nThe last time the Bishop was in Rome he had heard an amusing story from\r\nMonsignor Mazzucchi, who had been secretary to Gregory XVI at the time\r\nwhen Father Vaillant went from his Ohio mission for his first visit to\r\nthe Holy City.\r\n\r\nJoseph had stayed in Rome for three months, living on about forty cents\r\na day and leaving nothing unseen. He several times asked Mazzucchi to\r\nsecure him a private audience with the Pope. The secretary liked the\r\nmissionary from Ohio; there was something abrupt and lively and na\xc3\xaff\r\nabout him, a kind of freshness he did not often find in the priests who\r\nflocked to Rome. So he arranged an interview at which only the Holy\r\nFather and Father Vaillant and Mazzucchi were present.\r\n\r\nThe missionary came in, attended by a chamberlain who carried two great\r\nblack valises full of objects to be blessed--instead of one, as was\r\ncustomary. After his reception, Father Joseph began to pour out such a\r\nvivid account of his missions and brother missionaries, that both the\r\nHoly Father and the secretary forgot to take account of time, and the\r\naudience lasted three times as long as such interviews were supposed to\r\nlast. Gregory XVI, that aristocratic and autocratic prelate, who stood\r\nso consistently on the wrong side in European politics, and was the\r\nenemy of Free Italy, had done more than any of his predecessors to\r\npropagate the Faith in remote parts of the world. And here was a\r\nmissionary after his own heart. Father Vaillant asked for blessings for\r\nhimself, his fellow priests, his missions, his Bishop. He opened his big\r\nvalises like pedlars\' packs, full of crosses, rosaries, prayer-books,\r\nmedals, breviaries, on which he begged more than the usual blessing. The\r\nastonished chamberlain had come and gone several times, and Mazzucchi at\r\nlast reminded the Holy Father that he had other engagements. Father\r\nVaillant caught up his two valises himself, the chamberlain not being\r\nthere at the moment, and thus laden, was bowing himself backward out of\r\nthe presence, when the Pope rose from his chair and lifted his hand, not\r\nin benediction but in salutation, and called out to the departing\r\nmissionary, as one man to another, "_Coraggio, Americano_!"\r\n\r\n\r\nBishop Latour found his Navajo house favourable for reflection, for\r\nrecalling the past and planning the future. He wrote long letters to his\r\nbrother and to old friends in France. The hogan was isolated like a\r\nship\'s cabin on the ocean, with the murmuring of great winds about it.\r\nThere was no opening except the door, always open, and the air without\r\nhad the turbid yellow light of sand-storms. All day long the sand came\r\nin through the cracks in the walls and formed little ridges on the earth\r\nfloor. It rattled like sleet upon the dead leaves of the tree-branch\r\nroof. This house was so frail a shelter that one seemed to be sitting in\r\nthe heart of a world made of dusty earth and moving air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nEUSABIO\r\n\r\n\r\nON the third day of his visit with Eusabio, the Bishop wrote a somewhat\r\nformal letter of recall to his Vicar, and then went for his daily walk\r\nin the desert. He stayed out until sunset, when the wind fell and the\r\nair cleared, to a crystal sharpness. As he was returning, still a mile\r\nor more up the river, he heard the deep sound of a cottonwood drum,\r\nbeaten softly. He surmised that the sound came from Eusabio\'s house, and\r\nthat his friend was at home.\r\n\r\nRetracing his steps to the settlement, Father Latour found Eusabio\r\nseated beside his doorway, singing in the Navajo language and beating\r\nsoftly on one end of his long drum. Before him two very little Indian\r\nboys, about four and five years old, were dancing to the music, on the\r\nhard beaten ground. Two women, Eusabio\'s wife and sister, looked on from\r\nthe deep twilight of the hut.\r\n\r\nThe little boys did not notice the stranger\'s approach. They were\r\nentirely engrossed in their occupation, their faces serious, their\r\nchocolate-coloured eyes half closed. The Bishop stood watching the\r\nflowing, supple movements of their arms and shoulders, the sure rhythm\r\nof their tiny moccasined feet, no larger than cottonwood leaves, as\r\nwithout a word of instruction they followed the irregular and\r\nstrangely-accented music. Eusabio himself wore an expression of\r\nreligious gravity. He sat with the drum between his knees, his broad\r\nshoulders bent forward; a crimson _banda_ covered his forehead to hold\r\nhis black hair. The silver on his dark wrists glittered as he stroked\r\nthe drum-head with a stick or merely tapped it with his fingers. When he\r\nfinished the song he was singing, he rose and introduced the little\r\nboys, his nephews, by their Indian names, Eagle Feather and Medicine\r\nMountain, after which he nodded to them in dismissal. They vanished into\r\nthe house. Eusabio handed the drum to his wife and walked away with his\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n"Eusabio," said the Bishop, "I want to send a letter to Father Vaillant,\r\nat Tucson. I will send Jacinto with it, provided you can spare me one of\r\nyour people to accompany me back to Santa F\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\n"I myself will ride with you to the Villa," said Eusabio. The Navajos\r\nstill called the capital by its old name.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the following morning, Jacinto was dispatched southward,\r\nand Father Latour and Eusabio, with their pack-mule, rode to the east.\r\n\r\nThe ride back to Santa F\xc3\xa9 was something under four hundred miles. The\r\nweather alternated between blinding sand-storms and brilliant sunlight.\r\nThe sky was as full of motion and change as the desert beneath it was\r\nmonotonous and still,--and there was so much sky, more than at sea, more\r\nthan anywhere else in the world. The plain was there, under one\'s feet,\r\nbut what one saw when one looked about was that brilliant blue world of\r\nstinging air and moving cloud. Even the mountains were mere ant-hills\r\nunder it. Elsewhere the sky is the roof of the world; but here the earth\r\nwas the floor of the sky. The landscape one longed for when one was far\r\naway, the thing all about one, the world one actually lived in, was the\r\nsky, the sky!\r\n\r\nTravelling with Eusabio was like travelling with the landscape made\r\nhuman. He accepted chance and weather as the country did, with a sort of\r\ngrave enjoyment. He talked little, ate little, slept anywhere, preserved\r\na countenance open and warm, and like Jacinto he had unfailing good\r\nmanners. The Bishop was rather surprised that he stopped so often by the\r\nway to gather flowers. One morning he came back with the mules, holding\r\na bunch of crimson flowers--long, tube-shaped bells, that hung lightly\r\nfrom one side of a naked stem and trembled in the wind.\r\n\r\n"The Indians call rainbow flower," he said, holding them up and making\r\nthe red tubes quiver. "It is early for these."\r\n\r\nWhen they left the rock or tree or sand dune that had sheltered them for\r\nthe night, the Navajo was careful to obliterate every trace of their\r\ntemporary occupation. He buried the embers of the fire and the remnants\r\nof food, unpiled any stones he had piled together, filled up the holes\r\nhe had scooped in the sand. Since this was exactly Jacinto\'s procedure,\r\nFather Latour judged that, just as it was the white man\'s way to assert\r\nhimself in any landscape, to change it, make it over a little (at least\r\nto leave some mark or memorial of his sojourn), it was the Indian\'s way\r\nto pass through a country without disturbing anything; to pass and leave\r\nno trace, like fish through the water, or birds through the air.\r\n\r\nIt was the Indian manner to vanish into the landscape, not to stand out\r\nagainst it. The Hopi villages that were set upon rock mesas, were made\r\nto look like the rock on which they sat, were imperceptible at a\r\ndistance. The Navajo hogans, among the sand and willows, were made of\r\nsand and willows. None of the pueblos would at that time admit glass\r\nwindows into their dwellings. The reflection of the sun on the glazing\r\nwas to them ugly and unnatural--even dangerous. Moreover, these Indians\r\ndisliked novelty and change. They came and went by the old paths worn\r\ninto the rock by the feet of their fathers, used the old natural\r\nstairway of stone to climb to their mesa towns, carried water from the\r\nold springs, even after white men had dug wells.\r\n\r\nIn the working of silver or drilling of turquoise the Indians had\r\nexhaustless patience; upon their blankets and belts and ceremonial robes\r\nthey lavished their skill and pains. But their conception of decoration\r\ndid not extend to the landscape. They seemed to have none of the\r\nEuropean\'s desire to "master" nature, to arrange and re-create. They\r\nspent their ingenuity in the other direction; in accommodating\r\nthemselves to the scene in which they found themselves. This was not so\r\nmuch from indolence, the Bishop thought, as from an inherited caution\r\nand respect. It was as if the great country were asleep, and they wished\r\nto carry on their lives without awakening it; or as if the spirits of\r\nearth and air and water were things not to antagonize and arouse. When\r\nthey hunted, it was with the same discretion; an Indian hunt was never\r\na slaughter. They ravaged neither the rivers nor the forest, and if they\r\nirrigated, they took as little water as would serve their needs. The\r\nland and all that it bore they treated with consideration; not\r\nattempting to improve it, they never desecrated it.\r\n\r\nAs Father Latour and Eusabio approached Albuquerque, they occasionally\r\nfell in with company; Indians going to and fro on the long winding\r\ntrails across the plain, or up into the Sandia mountains. They had all\r\nof them the same quiet way of moving, whether their pace was swift or\r\nslow, and the same unobtrusive demeanour: an Indian wrapped in his\r\nbright blanket, seated upon his mule or walking beside it, moving\r\nthrough the pale new-budding sage-brush, winding among the sand waves,\r\nas if it were his business to pass unseen and unheard through a country\r\nawakening with spring.\r\n\r\nNorth of Laguna two Zu\xc3\xb1i runners sped by them, going somewhere east on\r\n"Indian business." They saluted Eusabio by gestures with the open palm,\r\nbut did not stop. They coursed over the sand with the fleetness of young\r\nantelope, their bodies disappearing and reappearing among the sand\r\ndunes, like the shadows that eagles cast in their strong, unhurried\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK EIGHT\r\n\r\n_GOLD UNDER PIKE\'S PEAK_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nCATHEDRAL\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER VAILLANT had been in Santa F\xc3\xa9 nearly three weeks, and as yet\r\nnothing had been revealed to him that warranted his Bishop in calling\r\nhim back from Tucson. One morning Fructosa came into the garden to tell\r\nhim that lunch would be earlier than usual, as the Bishop was going to\r\nride somewhere that afternoon. Half an hour later he joined his superior\r\nin the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop seldom lunched alone. That was the hour when he could most\r\nconveniently entertain a priest from one of the distant parishes, an\r\narmy officer, an American trader, a visitor from Old Mexico or\r\nCalifornia. He had no parlour--his dining-room served that purpose. It\r\nwas long and cool, with windows only at the west end, opening into the\r\ngarden. The green jalousies let in a tempered light. Sunbeams played on\r\nthe white, rounded walls and twinkled on the glass and silver of the\r\nsideboard. When Madame Olivares left Santa F\xc3\xa9 to return to New Orleans\r\nand sold her effects at auction, Father Latour bought her sideboard, and\r\nthe dining-table around which friends had so often gathered. Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nIsabella gave him her silver coffee service and candelabra for\r\nremembrance. They were the only ornaments of the severe and shadowy\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was already at his place when Father Joseph entered.\r\n"Fructosa has told you why we are lunching early? We will take a ride\r\nthis afternoon. I have something to show you."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Perhaps you have noticed that I am a little restless. I\r\ndon\'t know when I have been two weeks out of the saddle before. When I\r\ngo to visit Contento in his stall, he looks at me reprovingly. He will\r\ngrow too fat."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop smiled, with a shade of sarcasm on his upper lip. He knew his\r\nJoseph. "Ah, well," he said carelessly, "a little rest will not hurt\r\nhim, after coming six hundred miles from Tucson. You can take him out\r\nthis afternoon, and I will ride Angelica."\r\n\r\nThe two priests left Santa F\xc3\xa9 a little after midday, riding west. The\r\nBishop did not disclose his objective, and the Vicar asked no questions.\r\nSoon they left the wagon road and took a trail running straight south,\r\nthrough an empty greasewood country sloping gradually in the direction\r\nof the naked, blue Sandia mountains.\r\n\r\nAt about four o\'clock they came out upon a ridge high over the Rio\r\nGrande valley. The trail dropped down a long decline at this point and\r\nwound about the foot of the Sandias into Albuquerque, some sixty miles\r\naway. This ridge was covered with cone-shaped, rocky hills, thinly clad\r\nwith pi\xc3\xb1ons, and the rock was a curious shade of green, something\r\nbetween sea-green and olive. The thin, pebbly earth, which was merely\r\nthe rock pulverized by weather, had the same green tint. Father Latour\r\nrode to an isolated hill that beetled over the western edge of the\r\nridge, just where the trail descended. This hill stood up high and quite\r\nalone, boldly facing the declining sun and the blue Sandias. As they\r\ndrew close to it, Father Vaillant noticed that on the western face the\r\nearth had been scooped away, exposing a rugged wall of rock--not green\r\nlike the surrounding hills, but yellow, a strong golden ochre, very much\r\nlike the gold of the sunlight that was now beating upon it. Picks and\r\ncrowbars lay about, and fragments of stone, freshly broken off.\r\n\r\n"It is curious, is it not, to find one yellow hill among all these green\r\nones?" remarked the Bishop, stooping to pick up a piece of the stone. "I\r\nhave ridden over these hills in every direction, but this is the only\r\none of its kind." He stood regarding the chip of yellow rock that lay in\r\nhis palm. As he had a very special way of handling objects that were\r\nsacred, he extended that manner to things which he considered beautiful.\r\nAfter a moment of silence he looked up at the rugged wall, gleaming gold\r\nabove them. "That hill, _Blanchet_, is my Cathedral."\r\n\r\nFather Joseph looked at his Bishop, then at the cliff, blinking.\r\n"_Vraiment_? Is the stone hard enough? A good colour, certainly;\r\nsomething like the colonnade of St. Peter\'s."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop smoothed the piece of rock with his thumb. "It is more like\r\nsomething nearer home--I mean, nearer Clermont. When I look up at this\r\nrock I can almost feel the Rhone behind me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you mean the old Palace of the Popes, at Avignon! Yes, you are\r\nright, it is very like. At this hour, it is like this."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop sat down on a boulder, still looking up at the cliff. "It is\r\nthe stone I have always wanted, and I found it quite by chance. I was\r\ncoming back from Isleta. I had been to see old Padre Jesus when he was\r\ndying. I had never come by this trail, but when I reached Santo Domingo\r\nI found the road so washed by a heavy rain that I turned out and decided\r\nto try this way home. I rode up here from the west in the late\r\nafternoon; this hill confronted me as it confronts us now, and I knew\r\ninstantly that it was my Cathedral."\r\n\r\n"Oh, such things are never accidents, Jean. But it will be a long while\r\nbefore you can think of building."\r\n\r\n"Not so very long, I hope. I should like to complete it before I die--if\r\nGod so wills. I wish to leave nothing to chance, or to the mercy of\r\nAmerican builders. I had rather keep the old adobe church we have now\r\nthan help to build one of those horrible structures they are putting up\r\nin the Ohio cities. I want a plain church, but I want a good one. I\r\nshall certainly never lift my hand to build a clumsy affair of red\r\nbrick, like an English coach-house. Our own Midi Romanesque is the right\r\nstyle for this country."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant sniffed and wiped his glasses. "If you once begin\r\nthinking about architects and styles, Jean! And if you don\'t get\r\nAmerican builders, whom will you get, pray?"\r\n\r\n"I have an old friend in Toulouse who is a very fine architect. I talked\r\nthis matter over with him when I was last at home. He cannot come\r\nhimself; he is afraid of the long sea voyage, and not used to horseback\r\ntravel. But he has a young son, still at his studies, who is eager to\r\nundertake the work. Indeed, his father writes me that it has become the\r\nyoung man\'s dearest ambition to build the first Romanesque church in the\r\nNew World. He will have studied the right models; he thinks our old\r\nchurches of the Midi the most beautiful in France. When we are ready, he\r\nwill come and bring with him a couple of good French stone-cutters. They\r\nwill certainly be no more expensive than workmen from St. Louis. Now\r\nthat I have found exactly the stone I want, my Cathedral seems to me\r\nalready begun. This hill is only about fifteen miles from Santa F\xc3\xa9;\r\nthere is an up-grade, but it is gradual. Hauling the stone will be\r\neasier than I could have hoped for."\r\n\r\n"You plan far ahead," Father Vaillant looked at his friend wonderingly.\r\n"Well, that is what a Bishop should be able to do. As for me, I see only\r\nwhat is under my nose. But I had no idea you were going in for fine\r\nbuilding, when everything about us is so poor--and we ourselves are so\r\npoor."\r\n\r\n"But the Cathedral is not for us, Father Joseph. We build for the\r\nfuture--better not lay a stone unless we can do that. It would be a\r\nshame to any man coming from a Seminary that is one of the architectural\r\ntreasures of France, to make another ugly church on this continent where\r\nthere are so many already."\r\n\r\n"You are probably right. I had never thought of it before. It never\r\noccurred to me that we could have anything but an Ohio church here. Your\r\nancestors helped to build Clermont Cathedral, I remember; two building\r\nBishops de la Tour back in the thirteenth century. Time brings things to\r\npass, certainly. I had no idea you were taking all this so much to\r\nheart."\r\n\r\nFather Latour laughed. "Is a cathedral a thing to be taken lightly,\r\nafter all?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, certainly not!" Father Vaillant moved his shoulders uneasily.\r\nHe did not himself know why he hung back in this.\r\n\r\nThe base of the hill before which they stood was already in shadow,\r\nsubdued to the tone of rich yellow clay, but the top was still melted\r\ngold--a colour that throbbed in the last rays of the sun. The Bishop\r\nturned away at last with a sigh of deep content. "Yes," he said slowly,\r\n"that rock will do very well. And now we must be starting home. Every\r\ntime I come here, I like this stone better. I could hardly have hoped\r\nthat God would gratify my personal taste, my vanity, if you will, in\r\nthis way. I tell you, _Blanchet_, I would rather have found that hill of\r\nyellow rock than have come into a fortune to spend in charity. The\r\nCathedral is near my heart, for many reasons. I hope you do not think me\r\nvery worldly."\r\n\r\nAs they rode home through the sage-brush silvered by moonlight, Father\r\nVaillant was still wondering why he had been called home from saving\r\nsouls in Arizona, and wondering why a poor missionary Bishop should care\r\nso much about a building. He himself was eager to have the Cathedral\r\nbegun; but whether it was Midi Romanesque or Ohio German in style,\r\nseemed to him of little consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM LEAVENWORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE day after the Bishop and his Vicar rode to the yellow rock the\r\nweekly post arrived at Santa F\xc3\xa9. It brought the Bishop many letters,\r\nand he was shut in his study all morning. At lunch he told Father\r\nVaillant that he would require his company that evening to consider with\r\nhim a letter of great importance from the Bishop of Leavenworth.\r\n\r\nThis letter of many pages was concerned with events that were happening\r\nin Colorado, in a part of the Rocky Mountains very little known. Though\r\nit was only a few hundred miles north of Santa F\xc3\xa9, communication with\r\nthat region was so infrequent that news travelled to Santa F\xc3\xa9 from\r\nEurope more quickly than from Pike\'s Peak. Under the shadow of that peak\r\nrich gold deposits had been discovered within the last year, but Father\r\nVaillant had first heard of this through a letter from France. Word of\r\nit had reached the Atlantic coast, crossed to Europe, and come from\r\nthere back to the South-west, more quickly than it could filter down\r\nthrough the few hundred miles of unexplored mountains and gorges between\r\nCripple Creek and Santa F\xc3\xa9. While Father Vaillant was at Tucson he had\r\nreceived a letter from his brother Marius, in Auvergne, and was vexed\r\nthat so much of it was taken up with inquiries about the gold rush to\r\nColorado, of which he had never heard, while Marius gave him but little\r\nnews of the war in Italy, which seemed relatively near and much more\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThat congested heaping up of the Rocky Mountain chain about Pike\'s Peak\r\nwas a blank space on the continent at this time. Even the fur trappers,\r\ncoming down from Wyoming to Taos with their pelts, avoided that humped\r\ngranite backbone. Only a few years before, Fr\xc3\xa9mont had tried to\r\npenetrate the Colorado Rockies, and his party had come half-starved into\r\nTaos at last, having eaten most of their horses. But within twelve\r\nmonths everything had changed. Wandering prospectors had found large\r\ndeposits of gold near Cripple Creek, and the mountains that were\r\nsolitary a year ago were now full of people. Wagon trains were streaming\r\nwestward across the prairies from the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Leavenworth wrote Father Latour that he himself had just\r\nreturned from a visit to Cripple Creek. He had found the slopes under\r\nPike\'s Peak dotted with camps, the gorges black with placer miners;\r\nthousands of people were living in tents and shacks, Cherry Creek was\r\nfull of saloons and gambling-rooms; and among all the wanderers and\r\nwastrels were many honest men, hundreds of good Catholics, and not one\r\npriest. The young men were adrift in a lawless society without spiritual\r\nguidance. The old men died from exposure and mountain pneumonia, with no\r\none to give them the last rites of the Church.\r\n\r\nThis new and populous community must, for the present, the Kansas Bishop\r\nwrote, be accounted under Father Latour\'s jurisdiction. His great\r\ndiocese, already enlarged by thousands of square miles to the south and\r\nwest, must now, on the north, take in the still undefined but suddenly\r\nimportant region of the Colorado Rockies. The Bishop of Leavenworth\r\nbegged him to send a priest there as soon as possible,--an able one, by\r\nall means, not only devoted, but resourceful and intelligent, one who\r\nwould be at his ease with all sorts of men. He must take his bedding and\r\ncamp outfit, medicines and provisions, and clothing for the severe\r\nwinter. At Camp Denver there was nothing to be bought but tobacco and\r\nwhisky. There were no women there, and no cook stoves. The miners lived\r\non half-baked dough and alcohol. They did not even keep the mountain\r\nwater pure, and so died of fever. All the living conditions were\r\nabominable.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after dinner, Father Latour read this letter aloud to\r\nFather Vaillant in his study. When he had finished, he put down the\r\nclosely written pages.\r\n\r\n"You have been complaining of inactivity, Father Joseph; here is your\r\nopportunity."\r\n\r\nFather Joseph, who had been growing more and more restless during the\r\nreading of the letter, said merely: "So now I must begin speaking\r\nEnglish again! I can start to-morrow if you wish it."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop shook his head. "Not so fast. There will be no hospitable\r\nMexicans to receive you at the end of this journey. You must take your\r\nliving with you. We will have a wagon built for you, and choose your\r\noutfit carefully. Tranquilino\'s brother, Sabino, will be your driver.\r\nThis, I fear, will be the hardest mission you have ever undertaken."\r\n\r\nThe two priests talked until a late hour. There was Arizona to be\r\nconsidered; somebody must be found to continue Father Vaillant\'s work\r\nthere. Of all the countries he knew, that desert and its yellow people\r\nwere the dearest to him. But it was the discipline of his life to break\r\nties; to say farewell and move on into the unknown.\r\n\r\nBefore he went to bed that night Father Joseph greased his boots and\r\ntrimmed the calloused spots on his feet with an old razor. At the\r\nMexican village of Chimayo, over toward the Truchas mountains, the good\r\npeople were especially devoted to a little equestrian image of Santiago\r\nin their church, and they made him a new pair of boots every few months,\r\ninsisting that he went abroad at night and wore out his shoes, even on\r\nhorseback. When Father Joseph stayed there, he used to tell them he\r\nwished that, in addition to the consecration of the hands, God had\r\nprovided some special blessing for the missionary\'s feet.\r\n\r\nHe recalled affectionately an incident which concerned this Santiago of\r\nChimayo. Some years ago Father Joseph was asked to go to the _calabozo_\r\nat Santa F\xc3\xa9 to see a murderer from Chimayo. The prisoner proved to be a\r\nboy of twenty, very gentle in face and manner. His name was Ramon\r\nArmajillo. He had been passionately fond of cock-fighting, and it was\r\nhis undoing. He had bred a rooster that never lost a battle, but had\r\nslit the necks of cocks in all the little towns about. At last Ramon\r\nbrought the bird to Santa F\xc3\xa9 to match him with a famous cock there, and\r\nhalf a dozen Chimayo boys came along and put up everything they had on\r\nRamon\'s rooster. The betting was heavy on both sides, and the gate\r\nreceipts also were to go to the winner. After a somewhat doubtful\r\nbeginning, Ramon\'s cock neatly ripped the jugular vein of his opponent;\r\nbut the owner of the defeated bird, before anyone could stop him,\r\nreached into the ring and wrung the victor\'s neck. Before he had dropped\r\nthe limp bunch of feathers from his hand, Ramon\'s knife was in his\r\nheart. It all happened in a flash--some of the witnesses even insisted\r\nthat the death of the man and the death of the cock were simultaneous.\r\nAll agreed that there was not time for a man to catch his breath between\r\nthe whirl of the wrist and the gleam of the knife. Unfortunately the\r\nAmerican judge was a very stupid man, who disliked Mexicans and hoped to\r\nwipe out cock-fighting. He accepted as evidence statements made by the\r\nmurdered man\'s friends to the effect that Ramon had repeatedly\r\nthreatened his life.\r\n\r\nWhen Father Vaillant went to see the boy in his cell a few days before\r\nhis execution, he found him making a pair of tiny buckskin boots, as if\r\nfor a doll, and Ramon told him they were for the little Santiago in the\r\nchurch at home. His family would come up to Santa F\xc3\xa9 for the hanging,\r\nand they would take the boots back to Chimayo, and perhaps the little\r\nsaint would say a good word for him.\r\n\r\nRubbing oil into his boots by candlelight, Father Vaillant sighed. The\r\ncriminals with whom he would have to do in Colorado would hardly be of\r\nthat type, he told himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nAUSPICE MARIA!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE construction of Father Vaillant\'s wagon took a month. It must be a\r\nwagon of very unusual design, capable of carrying a great deal, yet\r\nlight enough and narrow enough to wind through the mountain gorges\r\nbeyond Pueblo,--where there were no roads at all except the rocky\r\nravines cut out by streams that flowed full in the spring but would be\r\ndry now in the autumn. While his wagon was building, Father Joseph was\r\ncarefully selecting his stores, and the furnishings for a small chapel\r\nwhich he meant to construct of saplings or canvas immediately upon his\r\narrival at Camp Denver. Moreover, there were his valises full of medals,\r\ncrosses, rosaries, coloured pictures and religious pamphlets. For\r\nhimself, he required no books but his breviary and the ordinary of the\r\nMass.\r\n\r\nIn the Bishop\'s courtyard he sorted and re-sorted his cargo, always\r\nfinding a more necessary article for which a less necessary had to be\r\ndiscarded. Fructosa and Magdalena were frequently called upon to help\r\nhim, and when a box was finally closed, Fructosa had it put away in the\r\nwoodshed. She had noticed the Bishop\'s brows contract slightly when he\r\ncame upon these trunks and chests in his hallway and dining-room. All\r\nthe bedding and clothing was packed in great sacks of dressed calfskin,\r\nwhich Sabino procured from old Mexican settlers. These were already\r\ngoing out of fashion, but in the early days they were the poor man\'s\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\nBishop Latour also was very busy at this time, training a new priest\r\nfrom Clermont; riding about with him among the distant parishes and\r\ntrying to give him an understanding of the people. As a Bishop, he could\r\nonly approve Father Vaillant\'s eagerness to be gone, and the enthusiasm\r\nwith which he turned to hardships of a new kind. But as a man, he was a\r\nlittle hurt that his old comrade should leave him without one regret. He\r\nseemed to know, as if it had been revealed to him, that this was a final\r\nbreak; that their lives would part here, and that they would never work\r\ntogether again. The bustle of preparation in his own house was painful\r\nto him, and he was glad to be abroad among the parishes.\r\n\r\nOne day when the Bishop had just returned from Albuquerque, Father\r\nVaillant came in to luncheon in high spirits. He had been out for a\r\ndrive in his new wagon, and declared that it was satisfactory at last.\r\nSabino was ready, and he thought they would start the day after\r\nto-morrow. He diagrammed his route on the table-cloth, and went over the\r\ncatalogue of his equipment. The Bishop was tired and scarcely touched\r\nhis food, but Father Joseph ate generously, as he was apt to do when\r\nfired by a new project.\r\n\r\nAfter Fructosa had brought the coffee, he leaned back in his chair and\r\nturned to his friend with a beaming face. "I often think, Jean, how you\r\nwere an unconscious agent in the hands of Providence when you recalled\r\nme from Tucson. I seemed to be doing the most important work of my life\r\nthere, and you recalled me for no reason at all, apparently. You did not\r\nknow why, and I did not know why. We were both acting in the dark. But\r\nHeaven knew what was happening at Cripple Creek, and moved us like\r\nchessmen on the board. When the call came, I was here to answer it--by a\r\nmiracle, indeed."\r\n\r\nFather Latour put down his silver coffee-cup. "Miracles are all very\r\nwell, Joseph, but I see none here. I sent for you because I felt the\r\nneed of your companionship. I used my authority as a Bishop to gratify\r\nmy personal wish. That was selfish, if you will, but surely natural\r\nenough. We are countrymen, and are bound by early memories. And that two\r\nfriends, having come together, should part and go their separate\r\nways--that is natural, too. No, I don\'t think we need any miracle to\r\nexplain all this."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant had been wholly absorbed in his preparations for saving\r\nsouls in the gold camps--blind to everything else. Now it came over him\r\nin a flash, how the Bishop had held himself aloof from his activities;\r\nit was a very hard thing for Father Latour to let him go; the loneliness\r\nof his position had begun to weigh upon him.\r\n\r\nYes, he reflected, as he went quietly to his own room, there was a great\r\ndifference in their natures. Wherever he went, he soon made friends that\r\ntook the place of country and family. But Jean, who was at ease in any\r\nsociety and always the flower of courtesy, could not form new ties. It\r\nhad always been so. He was like that even as a boy; gracious to\r\neveryone, but known to a very few. To man\'s wisdom it would have seemed\r\nthat a priest with Father Latour\'s exceptional qualities would have been\r\nbetter placed in some part of the world where scholarship, a handsome\r\nperson, and delicate perceptions all have their effect; and that a man\r\nof much rougher type would have served God well enough as the first\r\nBishop of New Mexico. Doubtless Bishop Latour\'s successors would be men\r\nof a different fibre. But God had his reasons, Father Joseph devoutly\r\nbelieved. Perhaps it pleased Him to grace the beginning of a new era and\r\na vast new diocese by a fine personality. And perhaps, after all,\r\nsomething would remain through the years to come; some ideal, or memory,\r\nor legend.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, his wagon loaded and standing ready in the\r\ncourtyard, Father Vaillant was seated at the Bishop\'s desk, writing\r\nletters to France; a short one to Marius, a long one to his beloved\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne, telling her of his plunge into the unknown and begging her\r\nprayers for his success in the world of gold-crazed men. He wrote\r\nrapidly and jerkily, moving his lips as well as his fingers. When the\r\nBishop entered the study, he rose and stood holding the written pages in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to interrupt you, Joseph, but do you intend to take\r\nContento with you to Colorado?"\r\n\r\nFather Joseph blinked. "Why, certainly. I had intended to ride him.\r\nHowever, if you have need for him here----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. Not at all. But if you take Contento, I will ask you to take\r\nAngelica as well. They have a great affection for each other; why\r\nseparate them indefinitely? One could not explain to them. They have\r\nworked long together."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant made no reply. He stood looking intently at the pages of\r\nhis letter. The Bishop saw a drop of water splash down upon the violet\r\nscript and spread. He turned quickly and went out through the arched\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sunrise next morning Father Vaillant set out, Sabino driving the\r\nwagon, his oldest boy riding Angelica, and Father Joseph himself riding\r\nContento. They took the old road to the north-east, through the sharp\r\nred sand-hills spotted with juniper, and the Bishop accompanied them as\r\nfar as the loop where the road wound out on the top of one of those\r\nconical hills, giving the departing traveller his last glimpse of Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9. There Father Joseph drew rein and looked back at the town lying\r\nrosy in the morning light, the mountain behind it, and the hills close\r\nabout it like two encircling arms.\r\n\r\n"_Auspice, Maria_!" he murmured as he turned his back on these familiar\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop rode home to his solitude. He was forty-seven years old, and\r\nhe had been a missionary in the New World for twenty years--ten of them\r\nin New Mexico. If he were a parish priest at home, there would be\r\nnephews coming to him for help in their Latin or a bit of pocket-money;\r\nnieces to run into his garden and bring their sewing and keep an eye on\r\nhis housekeeping. All the way home he indulged in such reflections as\r\nany bachelor nearing fifty might have.\r\n\r\nBut when he entered his study, he seemed to come back to reality, to the\r\nsense of a Presence awaiting him. The curtain of the arched doorway had\r\nscarcely fallen behind him when that feeling of personal loneliness was\r\ngone, and a sense of loss was replaced by a sense of restoration. He sat\r\ndown before his desk, deep in reflection. It was just this solitariness\r\nof love in which a priest\'s life could be like his Master\'s. It was not\r\na solitude of atrophy, of negation, but of perpetual flowering. A life\r\nneed not be cold, or devoid of grace in the worldly sense, if it were\r\nfilled by Her who was all the graces; Virgin-daughter, Virgin-mother,\r\ngirl of the people and Queen of Heaven: _le r\xc3\xaave supr\xc3\xaame de la chair_.\r\nThe nursery tale could not vie with Her in simplicity, the wisest\r\ntheologians could not match Her in profundity.\r\n\r\nHere in his own church in Santa F\xc3\xa9 there was one of these nursery\r\nVirgins, a little wooden figure, very old and very dear to the people.\r\nDe Vargas, when he recaptured the city for Spain two hundred years ago,\r\nhad vowed a yearly procession in her honour, and it was still one of the\r\nmost solemn events of the Christian year in Santa F\xc3\xa9. She was a little\r\nwooden figure, about three feet high, very stately in bearing, with a\r\nbeautiful though rather severe Spanish face. She had a rich wardrobe; a\r\nchest full of robes and laces, and gold and silver diadems. The women\r\nloved to sew for her and the silversmiths to make her chains and\r\nbrooches. Father Latour had delighted her wardrobe keepers when he told\r\nthem he did not believe the Queen of England or the Empress of France\r\nhad so many costumes. She was their doll and their queen, something to\r\nfondle and something to adore, as Mary\'s Son must have been to Her.\r\n\r\nThese poor Mexicans, he reflected, were not the first to pour out their\r\nlove in this simple fashion. Raphael and Titian had made costumes for\r\nHer in their time, and the great masters had made music for Her, and the\r\ngreat architects had built cathedrals for Her. Long before Her years on\r\nearth, in the long twilight between the Fall and the Redemption, the\r\npagan sculptors were always trying to achieve the image of a goddess who\r\nshould yet be a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nBishop Latour\'s premonition was right: Father Vaillant never returned to\r\nshare his work in New Mexico. Come back he did, to visit his old\r\nfriends, whenever his busy life permitted. But his destiny was fulfilled\r\nin the cold, steely Colorado Rockies, which he never loved as he did the\r\nblue mountains of the South. He came back to Santa F\xc3\xa9 to recuperate\r\nfrom the illnesses and accidents which consistently punctuated his way;\r\ncame with the Papal Emissary when Bishop Latour was made Archbishop; but\r\nhis working life was spent among bleak mountains and comfortless mining\r\ncamps, looking after lost sheep.\r\n\r\nCreede, Durango, Silver City, Central City, over the Continental Divide\r\ninto Utah,--his strange Episcopal carriage was known throughout that\r\nrugged granite world.\r\n\r\nIt was a covered carriage, on springs, and long enough for him to lie\r\ndown in at night,--Father Joseph was a very short man. At the back was a\r\nluggage box, which could be made into an altar when he celebrated Mass\r\nin the open, under a pine tree. He used to say that the mountain\r\ntorrents were the first road builders, and that wherever they found a\r\nway, he could find one. He wore out driver after driver, and his coach\r\nwas repaired so often and so extensively that long before he abandoned\r\nit there was none of the original structure left.\r\n\r\nBroken tongues and singletrees, smashed wheels and splintered axles he\r\nconsidered trifling matters. Twice the old carriage itself slipped off\r\nthe mountain road and rolled down the gorge, with the priest inside.\r\nFrom the first accident of this kind, Father Vaillant escaped with\r\nnothing worse than a sprain, and he wrote Bishop Latour that he\r\nattributed his preservation to the Archangel Raphael, whose office he\r\nhad said with unusual fervour that morning. The second time he rolled\r\ndown a ravine, near Central City, his thigh-bone was broken just below\r\nthe joint. It knitted in time, but he was lamed for life, and could\r\nnever ride horseback again.\r\n\r\nBefore this accident befell him, however, he had one long visit among\r\nhis friends in Santa F\xc3\xa9 and Albuquerque, a renewal of old ties that was\r\nlike an Indian summer in his life. When he left Denver, he told his\r\ncongregation there that he was going to the Mexicans to beg for money.\r\nThe church in Denver was under a roof, but the windows had been boarded\r\nup for months because nobody would buy glass for them. In his Denver\r\ncongregation there were men who owned mines and saw-mills and\r\nflourishing businesses, but they needed all their money to push these\r\nenterprises. Down among the Mexicans, who owned nothing but a mud house\r\nand a burro, he could always raise money. If they had anything at all,\r\nthey gave.\r\n\r\nHe called this trip frankly a begging expedition, and he went in his\r\ncarriage to bring back whatever he could gather. When he got as far as\r\nTaos, his Irish driver mutinied. Not another mile over these roads, he\r\nsaid. He knew his own territory, but here he refused to risk his neck\r\nand the Padre\'s. There was then no wagon road from Taos to Santa F\xc3\xa9. It\r\nwas nearly a fortnight before Father Vaillant found a man who would\r\nundertake to get him through the mountains. At last an old driver,\r\nschooled on the wagon trains, volunteered; and with the help of ax and\r\npick and shovel, he brought the Episcopal carriage safely to Santa F\xc3\xa9\r\nand into the Bishop\'s courtyard.\r\n\r\nOnce again among his own people, as he still called them, Father Joseph\r\nopened his campaign, and the poor Mexicans began taking dollars out of\r\ntheir shirts and boots (favourite places for carrying money) to pay for\r\nwindows in the Denver church. His petitions did not stop with\r\nwindows--indeed, they only began there. He told the sympathetic women of\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9 and Albuquerque about all the stupid, unnecessary discomforts\r\nof his life in Denver, discomforts that amounted to improprieties. It\r\nwas a part of the Wild West attitude to despise the decencies of life.\r\nHe told them how glad he was to sleep in good Mexican beds once more. In\r\nDenver he lay on a mattress stuffed with straw; a French priest who was\r\nvisiting him had pulled out a long stem of hay that stuck through the\r\nthin ticking, and called it an American feather. His dining-table was\r\nmade of planks covered with oilcloth. He had no linen at all, neither\r\nsheets nor serviettes, and he used his wornout shirts for face towels.\r\nThe Mexican women could scarcely bear to hear of such things. Nobody in\r\nColorado planted gardens, Father Vaillant related; nobody would stick a\r\nshovel into the earth for anything less than gold. There was no butter,\r\nno milk, no eggs, no fruit. He lived on dough and cured hog meat.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks after his arrival, six featherbeds were sent to the\r\nBishop\'s house for Father Vaillant; dozens of linen sheets, embroidered\r\npillowcases and table-cloths and napkins; strings of chili and boxes of\r\nbeans and dried fruit. The little settlement of Chimayo sent a roll of\r\ntheir finest blankets.\r\n\r\nAs these gifts arrived, Father Joseph put them in the woodhouse, knowing\r\nwell that the Bishop was always embarrassed by his readiness to receive\r\npresents. But one morning Father Latour had occasion to go into the\r\nwoodhouse, and he saw for himself.\r\n\r\n"Father Joseph," he remonstrated, "you will never be able to take all\r\nthese things back to Denver. Why, you would need an ox-cart to carry\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\n"Very well," replied Father Joseph, "then God will send me an ox-cart."\r\n\r\nAnd He did, with a driver to take the cart as far as Pueblo.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of his departure for home, when his carriage was ready,\r\nthe cart covered with tarpaulins and the oxen yoked, Father Vaillant,\r\nwho had been hurrying everyone since the first streak of light, suddenly\r\nbecame deliberate. He went into the Bishop\'s study and sat down, talking\r\nto him of unimportant matters, lingering as if there were something\r\nstill undone.\r\n\r\n"Well, we are getting older, Jean," he said abruptly, after a short\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop smiled. "Ah, yes. We are not young men any more. One of these\r\ndepartures will be the last."\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant nodded. "Whenever God wills. I am ready." He rose and\r\nbegan to pace the floor, addressing his friend without looking at him.\r\n"But it has not been so bad, Jean? We have done the things we used to\r\nplan to do, long ago, when we were Seminarians,--at least some of them.\r\nTo fulfil the dreams of one\'s youth; that is the best that can happen to\r\na man. No worldly success can take the place of that."\r\n\r\n"_Blanchet_," said the Bishop rising, "you are a better man than I. You\r\nhave been a great harvester of souls, without pride and without\r\nshame--and I am always a little cold--_un p\xc3\xa9dant_, as you used to say.\r\nIf hereafter we have stars in our crowns, yours will be a constellation.\r\nGive me your blessing."\r\n\r\nHe knelt, and Father Vaillant, having blessed him, knelt and was blessed\r\nin turn. They embraced each other for the past--for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK NINE\r\n\r\n_DEATH COMES FOR THE\r\nARCHBISHOP_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN that devout nun, Mother Superior Philom\xc3\xa8ne, died at a great age in\r\nher native Riom, among her papers were found several letters from\r\nArchbishop Latour, one dated December 1888, only a few months before his\r\ndeath. "Since your brother was called to his reward," he wrote, "I feel\r\nnearer to him than before. For many years Duty separated us, but death\r\nhas brought us together. The time is not far distant when I shall join\r\nhim. Meanwhile, I am enjoying to the full that period of reflection\r\nwhich is the happiest conclusion to a life of action."\r\n\r\nThis period of reflection the Archbishop spent on his little country\r\nestate, some four miles north of Santa F\xc3\xa9. Long before his retirement\r\nfrom the cares of the diocese, Father Latour bought those few acres in\r\nthe red sand-hills near the Tesuque pueblo, and set out an orchard which\r\nwould be bearing when the time came for him to rest. He chose this place\r\nin the red hills spotted with juniper against the advice of his friends,\r\nbecause he believed it to be admirably suited for the growing of fruit.\r\n\r\nOnce when he was riding out to visit the Tesuque mission, he had\r\nfollowed a stream and come upon this spot, where he found a little\r\nMexican house and a garden shaded by an apricot tree of such great size\r\nas he had never seen before. It had two trunks, each of them thicker\r\nthan a man\'s body, and though evidently very old, it was full of fruit.\r\nThe apricots were large, beautifully coloured, and of superb flavour.\r\nSince this tree grew against the hill-side, the Archbishop concluded that\r\nthe exposure there must be excellent for fruit. He surmised that the\r\nheat of the sun, reflected from the rocky hill-slope up into the tree,\r\ngave the fruit an even temperature, warmth from two sides, such as\r\nbrings the wall peaches to perfection in France.\r\n\r\nThe old Mexican who lived there said the tree must be two hundred years\r\nold; it had been just like this when his grandfather was a boy, and had\r\nalways borne luscious apricots like these. The old man would be glad to\r\nsell the place and move into Santa F\xc3\xa9, the Bishop found, and he bought\r\nit a few weeks later. In the spring he set out his orchard and a few\r\nrows of acacia trees. Some years afterward he built a little adobe\r\nhouse, with a chapel, high up on the hill-side overlooking the orchard.\r\nThither he used to go for rest and at seasons of special devotion. After\r\nhis retirement, he went there to live, though he always kept his study\r\nunchanged in the house of the new Archbishop.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his retirement Father Latour\'s principal work was the training of the\r\nnew missionary priests who arrived from France. His successor, the\r\nsecond Archbishop, was also an Auvergnat, from Father Latour\'s own\r\ncollege, and the clergy of northern New Mexico remained predominantly\r\nFrench. When a company of new priests arrived (they never came singly)\r\nArchbishop S---- sent them out to stay with Father Latour for a few\r\nmonths, to receive instruction in Spanish, in the topography of the\r\ndiocese, in the character and traditions of the different pueblos.\r\n\r\nFather Latour\'s recreation was his garden. He grew such fruit as was\r\nhardly to be found even in the old orchards of California; cherries and\r\napricots, apples and quinces, and the peerless pears of France--even the\r\nmost delicate varieties. He urged the new priests to plant fruit trees\r\nwherever they went, and to encourage the Mexicans to add fruit to their\r\nstarchy diet. Wherever there was a French priest, there should be a\r\ngarden of fruit trees and vegetables and flowers. He often quoted to his\r\nstudents that passage from their fellow Auvergnat, Pascal: that Man was\r\nlost and saved in a garden.\r\n\r\nHe domesticated and developed the native wild flowers. He had one\r\nhill-side solidly clad with that low-growing purple verbena which mats\r\nover the hills of New Mexico. It was like a great violet velvet mantle\r\nthrown down in the sun; all the shades that the dyers and weavers of\r\nItaly and France strove for through centuries, the violet that is full\r\nof rose colour and is yet not lavender; the blue that becomes almost\r\npink and then retreats again into sea-dark purple--the true Episcopal\r\ncolour and countless variations of it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1885 there came to New Mexico a young Seminarian, Bernard\r\nDucrot, who became like a son to Father Latour. The story of the old\r\nArchbishop\'s life, often told in the cloisters and class-rooms at\r\nMontferrand, had taken hold of this boy\'s imagination, and he had long\r\nwaited an opportunity to come. Bernard was handsome in person and of\r\nunusual mentality, had in himself the fineness to reverence all that was\r\nfine in his venerable Superior. He anticipated Father Latour\'s every\r\nwish, shared his reflections, cherished his reminiscences.\r\n\r\n"Surely," the Bishop used to say to the priests, "God himself has sent\r\nme this young man to help me through the last years."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGHOUT the autumn of the year \'88 the Bishop was in good health. He\r\nhad five French priests in his house, and he still rode abroad with them\r\nto visit the nearer missions. On Christmas eve, he performed the\r\nmidnight Mass in the Cathedral at Santa F\xc3\xa9. In January he drove with\r\nBernard to Santa Cruz to see the resident priest, who was ill. While\r\nthey were on their way home the weather suddenly changed, and a violent\r\nrain-storm overtook them. They were in an open buggy and were drenched\r\nto the skin before they could reach any Mexican house for shelter.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving home, Father Latour went at once to bed. During the night\r\nhe slept badly and felt feverish. He called none of his household, but\r\narose at the usual hour before dawn and went into the chapel for his\r\ndevotions. While he was at prayer, he was seized with a chill. He made\r\nhis way to the kitchen, and his old cook, Fructosa, alarmed at once, put\r\nhim to bed and gave him brandy. This chill left him feverish, and he\r\ndeveloped a distressing cough.\r\n\r\nAfter keeping quietly to his bed for a few days, the Bishop called young\r\nBernard to him one morning and said:\r\n\r\n"Bernard, will you ride into Santa F\xc3\xa9 to-day and see the Archbishop for\r\nme. Ask him whether it will be quite convenient if I return to occupy my\r\nstudy in his house for a short time. _Je voudrais mourir \xc3\xa0 Santa F\xc3\xa9_."\r\n\r\n"I will go at once, Father. But you should not be discouraged; one does\r\nnot die of a cold."\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled. "I shall not die of a cold, my son. I shall die of\r\nhaving lived."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, he spoke only French to those about him, and this\r\nsudden relaxing of his rule alarmed his household more than anything\r\nelse about his condition. When a priest had received bad news from home,\r\nor was ill, Father Latour would converse with him in his own language;\r\nbut at other times he required that all conversation in his house should\r\nbe in Spanish or English.\r\n\r\nBernard returned that afternoon to say that the Archbishop would be\r\ndelighted if Father Latour would remain the rest of the winter with him.\r\nMagdalena had already begun to air his study and put it in order, and\r\nshe would be in special attendance upon him during his visit. The\r\nArchbishop would send his new carriage to fetch him, as Father Latour\r\nhad only an open buggy.\r\n\r\n"Not to-day, _mon fils_," said the Bishop. "We will choose a day when I\r\nam feeling stronger; a fair day, when we can go in my own buggy, and you\r\ncan drive me. I wish to go late in the afternoon, toward sunset."\r\n\r\nBernard understood. He knew that once, long ago, at that hour of the\r\nday, a young Bishop had ridden along the Albuquerque road and seen Santa\r\nF\xc3\xa9 for the first time... And often, when they were driving into town\r\ntogether, the Bishop had paused with Bernard on that hill-top from which\r\nFather Vaillant had looked back on Santa F\xc3\xa9, when he went away to\r\nColorado to begin the work that had taken the rest of his life and made\r\nhim, too, a Bishop in the end.\r\n\r\nThe old town was better to look at in those days, Father Latour used to\r\ntell Bernard with a sigh. In the old days it had an individuality, a\r\nstyle of its own; a tawny adobe town with a few green trees, set in a\r\nhalf-circle of carnelian-coloured hills; that and no more. But the year\r\n1880 had begun a period of incongruous American building. Now, half the\r\nplaza square was still adobe, and half was flimsy wooden buildings with\r\ndouble porches, scroll-work and jackstraw posts and banisters painted\r\nwhite. Father Latour said the wooden houses which had so distressed him\r\nin Ohio, had followed him. All this was quite wrong for the Cathedral\r\nhe had been so many years in building,--the Cathedral that had taken\r\nFather Vaillant\'s place in his life after that remarkable man went away.\r\n\r\nFather Latour made his last entry into Santa F\xc3\xa9 at the end of a\r\nbrilliant February afternoon; Bernard stopped the horses at the foot of\r\nthe long street to await the sunset.\r\n\r\nWrapped in his Indian blankets, the old Archbishop sat for a long while,\r\nlooking at the open, golden face of his Cathedral. How exactly young\r\nMolny, his French architect, had done what he wanted! Nothing\r\nsensational, simply honest building and good stone-cutting,--good Midi\r\nRomanesque of the plainest. And even now, in winter, when the acacia\r\ntrees before the door were bare, how it was of the South, that church,\r\nhow it sounded the note of the South!\r\n\r\nNo one but Molny and the Bishop had ever seemed to enjoy the beautiful\r\nsite of that building,--perhaps no one ever would. But these two had\r\nspent many an hour admiring it. The steep carnelian hills drew up so\r\nclose behind the church that the individual pine trees thinly wooding\r\ntheir slopes were clearly visible. From the end of the street where the\r\nBishop\'s buggy stood, the tawny church seemed to start directly out of\r\nthose rose-coloured hills--with a purpose so strong that it was like\r\naction. Seen from this distance, the Cathedral lay against the\r\npinesplashed slopes as against a curtain. When Bernard drove slowly\r\nnearer, the backbone of the hills sank gradually, and the towers rose\r\nclear into the blue air, while the body of the church still lay against\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\nThe young architect used to tell the Bishop that only in Italy, or in\r\nthe opera, did churches leap out of mountains and black pines like that.\r\nMore than once Molny had called the Bishop from his study to look at the\r\nunfinished building when a storm was coming up; then the sky above the\r\nmountain grew black, and the carnelian rocks became an intense lavender,\r\nall their pine trees strokes of dark purple; the hills drew nearer, the\r\nwhole background approached like a dark threat.\r\n\r\n"Setting," Molny used to tell Father Latour, "is accident. Either a\r\nbuilding is a part of a place, or it is not. Once that kinship is there,\r\ntime will only make it stronger."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was recalling this saying of Molny\'s when a voice out of the\r\npresent sounded in his ear. It was Bernard.\r\n\r\n"A fine sunset, Father. See how red the mountains are growing; Sangre de\r\nCristo."\r\n\r\nYes, Sangre de Cristo; but no matter how scarlet the sunset, those red\r\nhills never became vermilion, but a more and more intense rose-carnelian;\r\nnot the colour of living blood, the Bishop had often reflected, but the\r\ncolour of the dried blood of saints and martyrs preserved in old\r\nchurches in Rome, which liquefies upon occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next morning Father Latour wakened with a grateful sense of nearness\r\nto his Cathedral--which would also be his tomb. He felt safe under its\r\nshadow; like a boat come back to harbour, lying under its own sea-wall.\r\nHe was in his old study; the Sisters had sent a little iron bed from the\r\nschool for him, and their finest linen and blankets. He felt a great\r\ncontent at being here, where he had come as a young man and where he had\r\ndone his work. The room was little changed; the same rugs and skins on\r\nthe earth floor, the same desk with his candlesticks, the same thick,\r\nwavy white walls that muted sound, that shut out the world and gave\r\nrepose to the spirit.\r\n\r\nAs the darkness faded into the grey of a winter morning, he listened for\r\nthe church bells,--and for another sound, that always amused him here;\r\nthe whistle of a locomotive. Yes, he had come with the buffalo, and he\r\nhad lived to see railway trains running into Santa F\xc3\xa9. He had\r\naccomplished an historic period.\r\n\r\nAll his relatives at home, and his friends in New Mexico, had expected\r\nthat the old Archbishop would spend his closing years in France,\r\nprobably in Clermont, where he could occupy a chair in his old college.\r\nThat seemed the natural thing to do, and he had given it grave\r\nconsideration. He had half expected to make some such arrangement the\r\nlast time he was in Auvergne, just before his retirement from his duties\r\nas Archbishop. But in the Old World he found himself homesick for the\r\nNew. It was a feeling he could not explain; a feeling that old age did\r\nnot weigh so heavily upon a man in New Mexico as in the Puy-de-D\xc3\xb4m.\r\n\r\nHe loved the towering peaks of his native mountains, the comeliness of\r\nthe villages, the cleanness of the country-side, the beautiful lines and\r\nthe cloisters of his own college. Clermont was beautiful,--but he found\r\nhimself sad there; his heart lay like a stone in his breast. There was\r\ntoo much past, perhaps... When the summer wind stirred the lilacs in the\r\nold gardens and shook down the blooms of the horsechestnuts, he\r\nsometimes closed his eyes and thought of the high song the wind was\r\nsinging in the straight, striped pine trees up in the Navajo forests.\r\n\r\nDuring the day his nostalgia wore off, and by dinner-time it was quite\r\ngone. He enjoyed his dinner and his wine, and the company of cultivated\r\nmen, and usually retired in good spirits. It was in the early morning\r\nthat he felt the ache in his breast; it had something to do with waking\r\nin the early morning. It seemed to him that the grey dawn lasted so long\r\nhere, the country was a long while in coming to life. The gardens and\r\nthe fields were damp, heavy-mists hung in the valley and obscured the\r\nmountains; hours went by before the sun could disperse those vapours and\r\nwarm and purify the villages.\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico he always awoke a young man; not until he rose and began\r\nto shave did he realize that he was growing older. His first\r\nconsciousness was a sense of the light dry wind blowing in through the\r\nwindows, with the fragrance of hot sun and sagebrush and sweet clover; a\r\nwind that made one\'s body feel light and one\'s heart cry "To-day,\r\nto-day," like a child\'s.\r\n\r\nBeautiful surroundings, the society of learned men, the charm of noble\r\nwomen, the graces of art, could not make up to him for the loss of those\r\nlight-hearted mornings of the desert, for that wind that made one a boy\r\nagain. He had noticed that this peculiar quality in the air of new\r\ncountries vanished after they were tamed by man and made to bear\r\nharvests. Parts of Texas and Kansas that he had first known as open\r\nrange had since been made into rich farming districts, and the air had\r\nquite lost that lightness, that dry aromatic odour. The moisture of\r\nplowed land, the heaviness of labour and growth and grain-bearing,\r\nutterly destroyed it; one could breathe that only on the bright edges of\r\nthe world, on the great grass plains or the sage-brush desert.\r\n\r\nThat air would disappear from the whole earth in time, perhaps; but long\r\nafter his day. He did not know just when it had become so necessary to\r\nhim, but he had come back to die in exile for the sake of it. Something\r\nsoft and wild and free, something that whispered to the ear on the\r\npillow, lightened the heart, softly, softly picked the lock, slid the\r\nbolts, and released the prisoned spirit of man into the wind, into the\r\nblue and gold, into the morning, into the morning!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER LATOUR arranged an order for his last days; if routine was\r\nnecessary to him in health, it was even more so in sickness. Early in\r\nthe morning Bernard came with hot water, shaved him, and helped him to\r\nbathe. They had brought nothing in from the country with them but\r\nclothing and linen, and the silver toilet articles the Olivares had\r\ngiven the Bishop so long ago; these thirty years he had washed his hands\r\nin that hammered basin. Morning prayers over, Magdalena came with his\r\nbreakfast, and he sat in his easy-chair while she made his bed and\r\narranged his room. Then he was ready to see visitors. The Archbishop\r\ncame in for a few moments, when he was at home; the Mother Superior, the\r\nAmerican doctor. Bernard read aloud to him the rest of the morning; St.\r\nAugustine, or the letters of Madame de Sevign\xc3\xa9, or his favourite\r\nPascal.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the morning hours, he dictated to his young disciple\r\ncertain facts about the old missions in the diocese; facts which he had\r\ncome upon by chance and feared would be forgotten. He wished he could do\r\nthis systematically, but he had not the strength. Those truths and\r\nfancies relating to a bygone time would probably be lost; the old\r\nlegends and customs and superstitions were already dying out. He wished\r\nnow that long ago he had had the leisure to write them down, that he\r\ncould have arrested their flight by throwing about them the light and\r\nelastic mesh of the French tongue.\r\n\r\nHe had, indeed, for years, directed the thoughts of the young priests\r\nwhom he instructed to the fortitude and devotion of those first\r\nmissionaries, the Spanish friars; declaring that his own life, when he\r\nfirst came to New Mexico, was one of ease and comfort compared with\r\ntheirs. If he had used to be abroad for weeks together on short rations,\r\nsleeping in the open, unable to keep his body clean, at least he had the\r\nsense of being in a friendly world, where by every man\'s fireside a\r\nwelcome awaited him.\r\n\r\nBut the Spanish Fathers who came up to Zu\xc3\xb1i, then went north to the\r\nNavajos, west to the Hopis, east to all the pueblos scattered between\r\nAlbuquerque and Taos, they came into a hostile country, carrying little\r\nprovisionment but their breviary and crucifix. When their mules were\r\nstolen by Indians, as often happened, they proceeded on foot, without a\r\nchange of raiment, without food or water. A European could scarcely\r\nimagine such hardships. The old countries were worn to the shape of\r\nhuman life, made into an investiture, a sort of second body, for man.\r\nThere the wild herbs and the wild fruits and the forest fungi were\r\nedible. The streams were sweet water, the trees afforded shade and\r\nshelter. But in the alkali deserts the water holes were poisonous, and\r\nthe vegetation offered nothing to a starving man. Everything was dry,\r\nprickly, sharp; Spanish bayonet, juniper, greasewood, cactus; the\r\nlizard, the rattlesnake,--and man made cruel by a cruel life. Those\r\nearly missionaries threw themselves naked upon the hard heart of a\r\ncountry that was calculated to try the endurance of giants. They\r\nthirsted in its deserts, starved among its rocks, climbed up and down\r\nits terrible canyons on stone-bruised feet, broke long fasts by unclean\r\nand repugnant food. Surely these endured _Hunger_, _Thirst_, _Cold_,\r\n_Nakedness_, of a kind beyond any conception St. Paul and his brethren\r\ncould have had. Whatever the early Christians suffered, it all happened\r\nin that safe little Mediterranean world, amid the old manners, the old\r\nlandmarks. If they endured martyrdom, they died among their brethren,\r\ntheir relics were piously preserved, their names lived in the mouths of\r\nholy men.\r\n\r\nRiding with his Auvergnats to the old missions that had been scenes of\r\nmartyrdom, the Bishop used to remind them that no man could know what\r\ntriumphs of faith had happened there, where one white man met torture\r\nand death alone among so many infidels, or what visions and revelations\r\nGod may have granted to soften that brutal end.\r\n\r\nWhen, as a young man, Father Latour first went down into Old Mexico, to\r\nclaim his See at the hands of the Bishop of Durango, he had met on his\r\njourney priests from the missions of Sonora and Lower California, who\r\nrelated many stories of the blessed experiences of the early Franciscan\r\nmissionaries. Their way through the wilderness had blossomed with little\r\nmiracles, it seemed. At one time, when the renowned Father Jun\xc3\xadpero\r\nSerra, and his two companions, were in danger of their lives from trying\r\nto cross a river at a treacherous point, a mysterious stranger appeared\r\nout of the rocks on the opposite shore, and calling to them in Spanish,\r\ntold them to follow him to a point farther up the stream, where they\r\nforded in safety. When they begged to know his name, he evaded them and\r\ndisappeared. At another time, they were traversing a great plain, and\r\nwere famished for water and almost spent; a young horseman overtook them\r\nand gave them three ripe pomegranates, then galloped away. This fruit\r\nnot only quenched their thirst, but revived and strengthened them as\r\nmuch as the most nourishing food could have done, and they completed\r\ntheir journey like fresh men.\r\n\r\nOne night in his travels through Durango, Father Latour was entertained\r\nat a great country estate where the resident chaplain happened to be a\r\npriest from one of the western missions; and he told a story of this\r\nsame Father Jun\xc3\xadpero which had come down in his own monastery from the\r\nold times.\r\n\r\nFather Jun\xc3\xadpero, he said, with a single companion, had once arrived at\r\nhis monastery on foot, without provisions. The Brothers had welcomed the\r\ntwo in astonishment, believing it impossible that men could have crossed\r\nso great a stretch of desert in this naked fashion. The Superior\r\nquestioned them as to whence they had come, and said the mission should\r\nnot have allowed them to set off without a guide and without food. He\r\nmarvelled how they could have got through alive. But Father Jun\xc3\xadpero\r\nreplied that they had fared very well, and had been most agreeably\r\nentertained by a poor Mexican family on the way. At this a muleteer, who\r\nwas bringing in wood for the Brothers, began to laugh, and said there\r\nwas no house for twelve leagues, nor anyone at all living in the sandy\r\nwaste through which they had come; and the Brothers confirmed him in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThen Father Jun\xc3\xadpero and his companion related fully their adventure.\r\nThey had set out with bread and water for one day. But on the second day\r\nthey had been travelling since dawn across a cactus desert and had begun\r\nto lose heart when, near sunset, they espied in the distance three great\r\ncottonwood trees, very tall in the declining light. Toward these they\r\nhastened. As they approached the trees, which were large and green and\r\nwere shedding cotton freely, they observed an ass tied to a dead trunk\r\nwhich stuck up out of the sand. Looking about for the owner of the ass,\r\nthey came upon a little Mexican house with an oven by the door and\r\nstrings of red peppers hanging on the wall. When they called aloud, a\r\nvenerable Mexican, clad in sheepskins, came out and greeted them kindly,\r\nasking them to stay the night. Going in with him, they observed that all\r\nwas neat and comely, and the wife, a young woman of beautiful\r\ncountenance, was stirring porridge by the fire. Her child, scarcely more\r\nthan an infant and with no garment but his little shirt, was on the\r\nfloor beside her, playing with a pet lamb.\r\n\r\nThey found these people gentle, pious, and well-spoken. The husband said\r\nthey were shepherds. The priests sat at their table and shared their\r\nsupper, and afterward read the evening prayers. They had wished to\r\nquestion the host about the country, and about his mode of life and\r\nwhere he found pasture for his flock, but they were overcome by a great\r\nand sweet weariness, and taking each a sheepskin provided him, they lay\r\ndown upon the floor and sank into deep sleep. When they awoke in the\r\nmorning they found all as before, and food set upon the table, but the\r\nfamily were absent, even to the pet lamb,--having gone, the Fathers\r\nsupposed, to care for their flock.\r\n\r\nWhen the Brothers at the monastery heard this account they were amazed,\r\ndeclaring that there were indeed three cottonwood trees growing together\r\nin the desert, a well-known landmark; but that if a settler had come, he\r\nmust have come very lately. So Father Jun\xc3\xadpero and Father Andrea, his\r\ncompanion, with some of the Brothers and the scoffing muleteer, went\r\nback into the wilderness to prove the matter. The three tall trees they\r\nfound, shedding their cotton, and the dead trunk to which the ass had\r\nbeen tied. But the ass was not there, nor any house, nor the oven by the\r\ndoor. Then the two Fathers sank down upon their knees in that blessed\r\nspot and kissed the earth, for they perceived what Family it was that\r\nhad entertained them there.\r\n\r\nFather Jun\xc3\xadpero confessed to the Brothers how from the moment he\r\nentered the house he had been strangely drawn to the child, and desired\r\nto take him in his arms, but that he kept near his mother. When the\r\npriest was reading the evening prayers the child sat upon the floor\r\nagainst his mother\'s knee, with the lamb in his lap, and the Father\r\nfound it hard to keep his eyes upon his breviary. After prayers, when he\r\nbade his hosts good-night, he did indeed stoop over the little boy in\r\nblessing; and the child had lifted his hand, and with his tiny finger\r\nmade the cross upon Father Jun\xc3\xadpero\'s forehead.\r\n\r\nThis story of Father Jun\xc3\xadpero\'s Holy Family made a strong impression\r\nupon the Bishop, when it was told him by the fireside of that great\r\nhacienda where he was a guest for the night. He had such an affection\r\nfor that story, indeed, that he had allowed himself to repeat it on but\r\ntwo occasions; once to the nuns of Mother Philom\xc3\xa8ne\'s convent in Riom,\r\nand once at a dinner given by Cardinal Mazzucchi, in Rome. There is\r\nalways something charming in the idea of greatness returning to\r\nsimplicity--the queen making hay among the country girls--but how much\r\nmore endearing was the belief that They, after so many centuries of\r\nhistory and glory, should return to play Their first parts, in the\r\npersons of a humble Mexican family, the lowliest of the lowly, the\r\npoorest of the poor,--in a wilderness at the end of the world, where the\r\nangels could scarcely find Them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER his _d\xc3\xa9jeuner_ the old Archbishop made a pretence of sleeping. He\r\nrequested not to be disturbed until dinner-time, and those long hours of\r\nsolitude were precious to him. His bed was at the dark end of the room,\r\nwhere the shadows were restful to his eyes; on fair days the other end\r\nwas full of sunlight, on grey days the light of the fire flickered along\r\nthe wavy white walls. Lying so still that the bed-clothes over his body\r\nscarcely moved, with his hands resting delicately on the sheet beside\r\nhim or upon his breast, the Bishop was living over his life. When he was\r\notherwise motionless, the thumb of his right hand would sometimes gently\r\ntouch a ring on his forefinger, an amethyst with an inscription cut upon\r\nit, _Auspice Maria_,--Father Vaillant\'s signet-ring; and then he was\r\nalmost certainly thinking of Joseph; of their life together here, in this\r\nroom ... in Ohio beside the Great Lakes ... as young men in Paris ... as\r\nboys at Montferrand. There were many passages in their missionary\r\nlife that he loved to recall; and how often and how fondly he recalled\r\nthe beginning of it!\r\n\r\nThey were both young men in their twenties, curates to older priests,\r\nwhen there came to Clermont a Bishop from Ohio, a native of Auvergne,\r\nlooking for volunteers for his missions in the West. Father Jean and\r\nFather Joseph heard him lecture at the Seminary, and talked with him in\r\nprivate. Before he left for the North, they had pledged themselves to\r\nmeet him in Paris at a given date, to spend some weeks of preparation at\r\nthe College for Foreign Missions in the rue du Bac, and then to sail\r\nwith him from Cherbourg.\r\n\r\nBoth the young priests knew that their families would strongly oppose\r\ntheir purpose, so they resolved to reveal it to no one; to make no\r\nadieux, but to steal away disguised in civilian\'s clothes. They\r\ncomforted each other by recalling that St. Francis Xavier, when he set\r\nforth as missionary to India, had stolen away like this; had "_passed\r\nthe dwelling of his parents without saluting them_," as they had learned\r\nat school; terrible words to a French boy.\r\n\r\nFather Vaillant\'s position was especially painful; his father was a\r\nstern, silent man, long a widower, who loved his children with a jealous\r\npassion and had no life but in their lives. Joseph was the eldest child.\r\nThe period between his resolve and its execution was a period of anguish\r\nfor him. As the date set for their departure drew near, he grew thinner\r\nand paler than ever.\r\n\r\nBy agreement the two friends were to meet at dawn in a certain field\r\noutside Riom on the fateful day, and there await the _diligence_ for\r\nParis. Jean Latour, having made his decision and pledged himself, knew\r\nno wavering. On the appointed morning he stole out of his sister\'s house\r\nand took his way through the sleeping town to that mountain field,\r\ntip-tilted by reason of its steepness, just beginning to show a cold\r\ngreen in the heavy light of a cloudy day-break. There he found his\r\ncomrade in a miserable plight. Joseph had been abroad in the fields all\r\nnight, wandering up and down, finding his purpose and losing it. His\r\nface was swollen with weeping. He shook with a chill, his voice was\r\nbeyond his control.\r\n\r\n"What shall I do, Jean? Help me!" he cried. "I cannot break my father\'s\r\nheart, and I cannot break the vow I have made to Heaven. I had rather\r\ndie than do either. Ah, if I could but die of this misery, here, now!"\r\n\r\nHow clearly the old Archbishop could recall the scene; those two young\r\nmen in the fields in the grey morning, disguised as if they were\r\ncriminals, escaping by stealth from their homes. He had not known how to\r\ncomfort his friend; it seemed to him that Joseph was suffering more than\r\nflesh could bear, that he was actually being torn in two by conflicting\r\ndesires. While they were pacing up and down, arm-in-arm, they heard a\r\nhollow sound; the _diligence_ rumbling down the mountain gorge. Joseph\r\nstood still and buried his face in his hands. The postilion\'s horn\r\nsounded.\r\n\r\n"_Allons_!" said Jean lightly. "_L\'invitation du voyage_! You will\r\naccompany me to Paris. Once we are there, if your father is not\r\nreconciled, we will get Bishop F---- to absolve you from your promise,\r\nand you can return to Riom. It is very simple."\r\n\r\nHe ran to the road-side and waved to the driver; the coach stopped. In a\r\nmoment they were off, and before long Joseph had fallen asleep in his\r\nseat from sheer exhaustion. But he always said that if Jean Latour had\r\nnot supported him in that hour of torment, he would have been a parish\r\npriest in the Puy de D\xc3\xb4m for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nOf the two young priests who set forth from Riom that morning in early\r\nspring, Jean Latour had seemed the one so much more likely to succeed in\r\na missionary\'s life. He, indeed, had a sound mind in a sound body.\r\nDuring the weeks they spent at the College of Foreign Missions in the\r\nrue du Bac, the authorities had been very doubtful of Joseph\'s fitness\r\nfor the hardships of the mission field. Yet in the long test of years it\r\nwas that frail body that had endured more and accomplished more.\r\n\r\nFather Latour often said that his diocese changed little except in\r\nboundaries. The Mexicans were always Mexicans, the Indians were always\r\nIndians. Santa F\xc3\xa9 was a quiet backwater, with no natural wealth, no\r\nimportance commercially. But Father Vaillant had been plunged into the\r\nmidst of a great industrial expansion, where guile and trickery and\r\nhonourable ambition all struggled together; a territory that developed\r\nby leaps and bounds and then experienced ruinous reverses. Every year,\r\neven after he was crippled, he travelled thousands of miles by stage and\r\nin his carriage, among the mountain towns that were now rich, now poor\r\nand deserted; Boulder, Gold Hill, Caribou, Cache-\xc3\xa0-la-Poudre, Spanish\r\nBar, South Park, up the Arkansas to Cache Creek and California Gulch.\r\n\r\nAnd Father Vaillant had not been content to be a mere missionary priest.\r\nHe became a promoter. He saw a great future for the Church in Colorado.\r\nWhile he was still so poor that he could not have a rectory of ordinary\r\ncomfort to live in, he began buying up great tracts of land for the\r\nChurch. He was able to buy a great deal of land for very little money,\r\nbut that little had to be borrowed from banks at a ruinous rate of\r\ninterest. He borrowed money to build schools and convents, and the\r\ninterest on his debts ate him up. He made long begging trips through\r\nOhio and Pennsylvania and Canada to raise money to pay this interest,\r\nwhich grew like a rolling snowball. He formed a land company, went\r\nabroad and floated bonds in France to raise money, and dishonest brokers\r\nbrought reproach upon his name.\r\n\r\nWhen he was nearly seventy, with one leg four inches shorter than the\r\nother, Father Vaillant, then first Bishop of Colorado, was summoned to\r\nRome to explain his complicated finance before the Papal court,--and he\r\nhad very hard work to satisfy the Cardinals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a dispatch was flashed into Santa F\xc3\xa9 announcing Bishop Vaillant\'s\r\ndeath, Father Latour at once took the new railroad for Denver. But he\r\ncould scarcely believe the telegram. He recalled the old nickname,\r\nTrompe-la-Mort, and remembered how many times before he had hurried\r\nacross mountains and deserts, not daring to hope he would find his\r\nfriend alive.\r\n\r\nCuriously, Father Latour could never feel that he had actually been\r\npresent at Father Joseph\'s funeral--or rather, he could not believe that\r\nFather Joseph was there. The shrivelled little old man in the coffin,\r\nscarcely larger than a monkey--that had nothing to do with Father\r\nVaillant. He could see Joseph as clearly as he could see Bernard, but\r\nalways as he was when they first came to New Mexico. It was not\r\nsentiment; that was the picture of Father Joseph his memory produced for\r\nhim, and it did not produce any other. The funeral itself, he liked to\r\nremember--as a recognition. It was held under canvas, in the open air;\r\nthere was not a building in Denver--in the whole Far West, for that\r\nmatter,--big enough for his _Blanchet\'s_ funeral. For two days before,\r\nthe populations of villages and mining camps had been streaming down the\r\nmountains; they slept in wagons and tents and barns; they made a throng\r\nlike a National Convention in the convent square. And a strange thing\r\nhappened at that funeral:\r\n\r\nFather Revardy, the French priest who had gone from Santa F\xc3\xa9 to\r\nColorado with Father Vaillant more than twenty years before, and had\r\nbeen with him ever since as his curate and Vicar, had been sent to\r\nFrance on business for his Bishop. While there, he was told by his\r\nphysician that he had a fatal malady, and he at once took ship and\r\nhurried homeward, to make his report to Bishop Vaillant and to die in\r\nthe harness. When he got as far as Chicago, he had an acute seizure and\r\nwas taken to a Catholic hospital, where he lay very ill. One morning a\r\nnurse happened to leave a newspaper near his bed; glancing at it, Father\r\nRevardy saw an announcement of the death of the Bishop of Colorado. When\r\nthe Sister returned, she found her patient dressed. He convinced her\r\nthat he must be driven to the railway station at once. On reaching\r\nDenver he entered a carriage and asked to be taken to the Bishop\'s\r\nfuneral. He arrived there when the services were nearly half over, and\r\nno one ever forgot the sight of this dying man, supported by the\r\ncab-driver and two priests, making his way through the crowd and\r\ndropping upon his knees beside the bier. A chair was brought for him,\r\nand for the rest of the ceremony he sat with his forehead resting\r\nagainst the edge of the coffin. When Bishop Vaillant was carried away to\r\nhis tomb, Father Revardy was taken to the hospital, where he died a few\r\ndays later. It was one more instance of the extraordinary personal\r\ndevotion that Father Joseph had so often aroused and retained so long,\r\nin red men and yellow men and white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING those last weeks of the Bishop\'s life he thought very little\r\nabout death; it was the Past he was leaving. The future would take care\r\nof itself. But he had an intellectual curiosity about dying; about the\r\nchanges that took place in a man\'s beliefs and scale of values. More and\r\nmore life seemed to him an experience of the Ego, in no sense the Ego\r\nitself. This conviction, he believed, was something apart from his\r\nreligious life; it was an enlightenment that came to him as a man, a\r\nhuman creature. And he noticed that he judged conduct differently now;\r\nhis own and that of others. The mistakes of his life seemed unimportant;\r\naccidents that had occurred _en route_, like the shipwreck in Galveston\r\nharbour, or the runaway in which he was hurt when he was first on his\r\nway to New Mexico in search of his Bishopric.\r\n\r\nHe observed also that there was no longer any perspective in his\r\nmemories. He remembered his winters with his cousins on the\r\nMediterranean when he was a little boy, his student days in the Holy\r\nCity, as clearly as he remembered the arrival of M. Molny and the\r\nbuilding of his Cathedral. He was soon to have done with calendared\r\ntime, and it had already ceased to count for him. He sat in the middle\r\nof his own consciousness; none of his former states of mind were lost or\r\noutgrown. They were all within reach of his hand, and all\r\ncomprehensible.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when Magdalena or Bernard came in and asked him a question,\r\nit took him several seconds to bring himself back to the present. He\r\ncould see they thought his mind was failing; but it was only\r\nextraordinarily active in some other part of the great picture of his\r\nlife--some part of which they knew nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the occasion warranted he could return to the present. But there\r\nwas not much present left; Father Joseph dead, the Olivares both dead,\r\nKit Carson dead, only the minor characters of his life remained in\r\npresent time. One morning, several weeks after the Bishop came back to\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9, one of the strong people of the old deep days of life did\r\nappear, not in memory but in the flesh, in the shallow light of the\r\npresent; Eusabio the Navajo. Out on the Colorado Chiquito he had heard\r\nthe word, passed on from one trading post to another, that the old\r\nArchbishop was failing, and the Indian came to Santa F\xc3\xa9. He, too, was\r\nan old man now. Once again their fine hands clasped. The Bishop brushed\r\na drop of moisture from his eye.\r\n\r\n"I have wished for this meeting, my friend. I had thought of asking you\r\nto come, but it is a long way."\r\n\r\nThe old Navajo smiled. "Not long now, any more. I come on the cars,\r\nPadre. I get on the cars at Gallup, and the same day I am here. You\r\nremember when we come together once to Santa F\xc3\xa9 from my country? How\r\nlong it take us? Two weeks, pretty near. Men travel faster now, but I do\r\nnot know if they go to better things."\r\n\r\n"We must not try to know the future, Eusabio. It is better not. And\r\nManuelito?"\r\n\r\n"Manuelito is well; he still leads his people."\r\n\r\nEusabio did not stay long, but he said he would come again to-morrow, as\r\nhe had business in Santa F\xc3\xa9 that would keep him for some days. He had\r\nno business there; but when he looked at Father Latour he said to\r\nhimself, "It will not be long."\r\n\r\nAfter he was gone, the Bishop turned to Bernard; "My son, I have lived\r\nto see two great wrongs righted; I have seen the end of black slavery,\r\nand I have seen the Navajos restored to their own country."\r\n\r\nFor many years Father Latour used to wonder if there would ever be an\r\nend to the Indian wars while there was one Navajo or Apache left alive.\r\nToo many traders and manufacturers made a rich profit out of that\r\nwarfare; a political machine and immense capital were employed to keep\r\nit going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Bishop\'s middle years in New Mexico had been clouded by the\r\npersecution of the Navajos and their expulsion from their own country.\r\nThrough his friendship with Eusabio he had become interested in the\r\nNavajos soon after he first came to his new diocese, and he admired\r\nthem; they stirred his imagination. Though this nomad people were much\r\nslower to adopt white man\'s ways than the homestaying Indians who dwelt\r\nin pueblos, and were much more indifferent to missionaries and the white\r\nman\'s religion, Father Latour felt a superior strength in them. There\r\nwas purpose and conviction behind their inscrutable reserve; something\r\nactive and quick, something with an edge. The expulsion of the Navajos\r\nfrom their country, which had been theirs no man knew how long, had\r\nseemed to him an injustice that cried to Heaven. Never could he forget\r\nthat terrible winter when they were being hunted down and driven by\r\nthousands from their own reservation to the Bosque Redondo, three\r\nhundred miles away on the Pecos River. Hundreds of them, men, women, and\r\nchildren, perished from hunger and cold on the way; their sheep and\r\nhorses died from exhaustion crossing the mountains. None ever went\r\nwillingly; they were driven by starvation and the bayonet; captured in\r\nisolated bands, and brutally deported.\r\n\r\nIt was his own misguided friend, Kit Carson, who finally subdued the\r\nlast unconquered remnant of that people; who followed them into the\r\ndepths of the Canyon de Chelly, whither they had fled from their grazing\r\nplains and pine forests to make their last stand. They were shepherds,\r\nwith no property but their live-stock, encumbered by their women and\r\nchildren, poorly armed and with scanty ammunition. But this canyon had\r\nalways before proved impenetrable to white troops. The Navajos believed\r\nit could not be taken. They believed that their old gods dwelt in the\r\nfastnesses of that canyon; like their Shiprock, it was an inviolate\r\nplace, the very heart and centre of their life.\r\n\r\nCarson followed them down into the hidden world between those towering\r\nwalls of red sandstone, spoiled their stores, destroyed their\r\ndeep-sheltered corn-fields, cut down the terraced peach orchards so dear\r\nto them. When they saw all that was sacred to them laid waste, the\r\nNavajos lost heart. They did not surrender; they simply ceased to fight,\r\nand were taken. Carson was a soldier under orders, and he did a\r\nsoldier\'s brutal work. But the bravest of the Navajo chiefs he did not\r\ncapture. Even after the crushing defeat of his people in the Canyon de\r\nChelly, Manuelito was still at large. It was then that Eusabio came to\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9 to ask Bishop Latour to meet Manuelito at Zu\xc3\xb1i. As a priest,\r\nthe Bishop knew that it was indiscreet to consent to a meeting with this\r\noutlawed chief; but he was a man, too, and a lover of justice. The\r\nrequest came to him in such a way that he could not refuse it. He went\r\nwith Eusabio.\r\n\r\nThough the Government was offering a heavy reward for his person, living\r\nor dead, Manuelito rode off his own reservation down into Zu\xc3\xb1i in broad\r\ndaylight, attended by some dozen followers, all on wretched,\r\nhalf-starved horses. He had been in hiding out in Eusabio\'s country on\r\nthe Colorado Chiquito.\r\n\r\nIt was Manuelito\'s hope that the Bishop would go to Washington and plead\r\nhis people\'s cause before they were utterly destroyed. They asked\r\nnothing of the Government, he told Father Latour, but their religion,\r\nand their own land where they had lived from immemorial times. Their\r\ncountry, he explained, was a part of their religion; the two were\r\ninseparable. The Canyon de Chelly the Padre knew; in that canyon his\r\npeople had lived when they were a small weak tribe; it had nourished and\r\nprotected them; it was their mother. Moreover, their gods dwelt\r\nthere--in those inaccessible white houses set in caverns up in the face\r\nof the cliffs, which were older than the white man\'s world, and which no\r\nliving man had ever entered. Their gods were there, just as the Padre\'s\r\nGod was in his church.\r\n\r\nAnd north of the Canyon de Chelly was the Shiprock, a slender crag\r\nrising to a dizzy height, all alone out on a flat desert. Seen at a\r\ndistance of fifty miles or so, that crag presents the figure of a\r\none-masted fishing-boat under full sail, and the white man named it\r\naccordingly. But the Indian has another name; he believes that rock was\r\nonce a ship of the air. Ages ago, Manuelito told the Bishop, that crag\r\nhad moved through the air, bearing upon its summit the parents of the\r\nNavajo race from the place in the far north where all peoples were\r\nmade,--and wherever it sank to earth was to be their land. It sank in a\r\ndesert country, where it was hard for men to live. But they had found\r\nthe Canyon de Chelly, where there was shelter and unfailing water. That\r\ncanyon and the Shiprock were like kind parents to his people, places\r\nmore sacred to them than churches, more sacred than any place is to the\r\nwhite man. How, then, could they go three hundred miles away and live in\r\na strange land?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Bosque Redondo was down on the Pecos, far east of the Rio\r\nGrande. Manuelito drew a map in the sand, and explained to the Bishop\r\nhow, from the very beginning, it had been enjoined that his people must\r\nnever cross the Rio Grande on the east, or the Rio San Juan on the\r\nnorth, or the Rio Colorado on the west; if they did, the tribe would\r\nperish. If a great priest, like Father Latour, were to go to Washington\r\nand explain these things, perhaps the Government would listen.\r\n\r\nFather Latour tried to tell the Indian that in a Protestant country the\r\none thing a Roman priest could not do was to interfere in matters of\r\nGovernment. Manuelito listened respectfully, but the Bishop saw that he\r\ndid not believe him. When he had finished, the Navajo rose and said:\r\n\r\n"You are the friend of Cristobal, who hunts my people and drives them\r\nover the mountains to the Bosque Redondo. Tell your friend that he will\r\nnever take me alive. He can come and kill me when he pleases. Two years\r\nago I could not count my flocks; now I have thirty sheep and a few\r\nstarving horses. My children are eating roots, and I do not care for my\r\nlife. But my mother and my gods are in the West, and I will never cross\r\nthe Rio Grande."\r\n\r\nHe never did cross it. He lived in hiding until the return of his exiled\r\npeople. For an unforeseen thing happened:\r\n\r\nThe Bosque Redondo proved an utterly unsuitable country for the Navajos.\r\nIt could have been farmed by irrigation, but they were nomad shepherds,\r\nnot farmers. There was no pasture for their flocks. There was no\r\nfirewood; they dug mesquite roots and dried them for fuel. It was an\r\nalkaline country, and hundreds of Indians died from bad water. At last\r\nthe Government at Washington admitted its mistake--which governments\r\nseldom do. After five years of exile, the remnant of the Navajo people\r\nwere permitted to go back to their sacred places.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Bishop took his French architect on a pack trip into Arizona\r\nto show him something of the country before he returned to France, and\r\nhe had the pleasure of seeing the Navajo horsemen riding free over their\r\ngreat plains again. The two Frenchmen went as far as the Canyon de\r\nChelly to behold the strange cliff ruins; once more crops were growing\r\ndown at the bottom of the world between the towering sandstone walls;\r\nsheep were grazing under the magnificent cottonwoods and drinking at the\r\nstreams of sweet water; it was like an Indian Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when he was an old man and ill, scenes from those bygone times,\r\ndark and bright, flashed back to the Bishop: the terrible faces of the\r\nNavajos waiting at the place on the Rio Grande where they were being\r\nferried across into exile; the long streams of survivors going back to\r\ntheir own country, driving their scanty flocks, carrying their old men\r\nand their children. Memories, too, of that time he had spent with\r\nEusabio on the Little Colorado, in the early spring, when the lambing\r\nseason was not yet over,--dark horsemen riding across the sands with\r\norphan lambs in their arms--a young Navajo woman, giving a lamb her\r\nbreast until a ewe was found for it.\r\n\r\n"Bernard," the old Bishop would murmur, "God has been very good to let\r\nme live to see a happy issue to those old wrongs. I do not believe, as I\r\nonce did, that the Indian will perish. I believe that God will preserve\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE American doctor was consulting with Archbishop S---- and the Mother\r\nSuperior. "It is his heart that is the trouble now. I have been giving\r\nhim small doses to stimulate it, but they no longer have any effect. I\r\nscarcely dare increase them; it might be fatal at once. But that is why\r\nyou see such a change in him."\r\n\r\nThe change was that the old man did not want food, and that he slept, or\r\nseemed to sleep, nearly all the time. On the last day of his life his\r\ncondition was pretty generally known. The Cathedral was full of people\r\nall day long, praying for him; nuns and old women, young men and girls,\r\ncoming and going. The sick man had received the Viaticum early in the\r\nmorning. Some of the Tesuque Indians, who had been his country\r\nneighbours, came into Santa F\xc3\xa9 and sat all day in the Archbishop\'s\r\ncourtyard listening for news of him; with them was Eusabio the Navajo.\r\nFructosa and Tranquilino, his old servants, were with the supplicants in\r\nthe Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior and Magdalena and Bernard attended the sick man.\r\nThere was little to do but to watch and pray, so peaceful and painless\r\nwas his repose. Sometimes it was sleep, they knew from his relaxed\r\nfeatures; then his face would assume personality, consciousness, even\r\nthough his eyes did not open.\r\n\r\nToward the close of day, in the short twilight after the candles were\r\nlighted, the old Bishop seemed to become restless, moved a little, and\r\nbegan to murmur; it was in the French tongue, but Bernard, though he\r\ncaught some words, could make nothing of them. He knelt beside the bed:\r\n"What is it, Father? I am here."\r\n\r\nHe continued to murmur, to move his hands a little, and Magdalena\r\nthought he was trying to ask for something, or to tell them something.\r\nBut in reality the Bishop was not there at all; he was standing in a\r\ntip-tilted green field among his native mountains, and he was trying to\r\ngive consolation to a young man who was being torn in two before his eyes\r\nby the desire to go and the necessity to stay. He was trying to forge a\r\nnew Will in that devout and exhausted priest; and the time was short,\r\nfor the _diligence_ for Paris was already rumbling down the mountain\r\ngorge.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Cathedral bell tolled just after dark, the Mexican population\r\nof Santa F\xc3\xa9 fell upon their knees, and all American Catholics as well.\r\nMany others who did not kneel prayed in their hearts. Eusabio and the\r\nTesuque boys went quietly away to tell their people; and the next\r\nmorning the old Archbishop lay before the high altar in the church he\r\nhad built.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DEATH COMES FOR THE\r\nARCHBISHOP ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
