I have been for\r\nmany years a teacher of languages. It is an occupation which at length\r\nbecomes fatal to whatever share of imagination, observation, and insight\r\nan ordinary person may be heir to. To a teacher of languages there comes\r\na time when the world is but a place of many words and man appears a\r\nmere talking animal not much more wonderful than a parrot.\r\n\r\nThis being so, I could not have observed Mr. Razumov or guessed at his\r\nreality by the force of insight, much less have imagined him as he was.\r\nEven to invent the mere bald facts of his life would have been utterly\r\nbeyond my powers. But I think that without this declaration the\r\nreaders of these pages will be able to detect in the story the marks of\r\ndocumentary evidence. And that is perfectly correct. It is based on\r\na document; all I have brought to it is my knowledge of the Russian\r\nlanguage, which is sufficient for what is attempted here. The document,\r\nof course, is something in the nature of a journal, a diary, yet not\r\nexactly that in its actual form. For instance, most of it was not\r\nwritten up from day to day, though all the entries are dated. Some of\r\nthese entries cover months of time and extend over dozens of pages. All\r\nthe earlier part is a retrospect, in a narrative form, relating to an\r\nevent which took place about a year before.\r\n\r\nI must mention that I have lived for a long time in Geneva. A whole\r\nquarter of that town, on account of many Russians residing there,\r\nis called La Petite Russie--Little Russia. I had a rather extensive\r\nconnexion in Little Russia at that time. Yet I confess that I have\r\nno comprehension of the Russian character. The illogicality of their\r\nattitude, the arbitrariness of their conclusions, the frequency of the\r\nexceptional, should present no difficulty to a student of many grammars;\r\nbut there must be something else in the way, some special human\r\ntrait--one of those subtle differences that are beyond the ken of mere\r\nprofessors. What must remain striking to a teacher of languages is the\r\nRussians\xe2\x80\x99 extraordinary love of words. They gather them up; they cherish\r\nthem, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t hoard them in their breasts; on the contrary, they\r\nare always ready to pour them out by the hour or by the night with an\r\nenthusiasm, a sweeping abundance, with such an aptness of application\r\nsometimes that, as in the case of very accomplished parrots, one can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndefend oneself from the suspicion that they really understand what they\r\nsay. There is a generosity in their ardour of speech which removes it as\r\nfar as possible from common loquacity; and it is ever too disconnected\r\nto be classed as eloquence.... But I must apologize for this\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to inquire why Mr. Razumov has left this record behind\r\nhim. It is inconceivable that he should have wished any human eye to see\r\nit. A mysterious impulse of human nature comes into play here. Putting\r\naside Samuel Pepys, who has forced in this way the door of immortality,\r\ninnumerable people, criminals, saints, philosophers, young girls,\r\nstatesmen, and simple imbeciles, have kept self-revealing records from\r\nvanity no doubt, but also from other more inscrutable motives. There\r\nmust be a wonderful soothing power in mere words since so many men have\r\nused them for self-communion. Being myself a quiet individual I take\r\nit that what all men are really after is some form or perhaps only some\r\nformula of peace. Certainly they are crying loud enough for it at the\r\npresent day. What sort of peace Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov expected\r\nto find in the writing up of his record it passeth my understanding to\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that he has written it.\r\n\r\nMr. Razumov was a tall, well-proportioned young man, quite unusually\r\ndark for a Russian from the Central Provinces. His good looks would have\r\nbeen unquestionable if it had not been for a peculiar lack of fineness\r\nin the features. It was as if a face modelled vigorously in wax (with\r\nsome approach even to a classical correctness of type) had been\r\nheld close to a fire till all sharpness of line had been lost in\r\nthe softening of the material. But even thus he was sufficiently\r\ngood-looking. His manner, too, was good. In discussion he was easily\r\nswayed by argument and authority. With his younger compatriots he took\r\nthe attitude of an inscrutable listener, a listener of the kind that\r\nhears you out intelligently and then--just changes the subject.\r\n\r\nThis sort of trick, which may arise either from intellectual\r\ninsufficiency or from an imperfect trust in one\xe2\x80\x99s own convictions,\r\nprocured for Mr. Razumov a reputation of profundity. Amongst a lot of\r\nexuberant talkers, in the habit of exhausting themselves daily by ardent\r\ndiscussion, a comparatively taciturn personality is naturally credited\r\nwith reserve power. By his comrades at the St. Petersburg University,\r\nKirylo Sidorovitch Razumov, third year\xe2\x80\x99s student in philosophy, was\r\nlooked upon as a strong nature--an altogether trustworthy man. This,\r\nin a country where an opinion may be a legal crime visited by death or\r\nsometimes by a fate worse than mere death, meant that he was worthy\r\nof being trusted with forbidden opinions. He was liked also for his\r\namiability and for his quiet readiness to oblige his comrades even at\r\nthe cost of personal inconvenience.\r\n\r\nMr. Razumov was supposed to be the son of an Archpriest and to be\r\nprotected by a distinguished nobleman--perhaps of his own distant\r\nprovince. But his outward appearance accorded badly with such humble\r\norigin. Such a descent was not credible. It was, indeed, suggested that\r\nMr. Razumov was the son of an Archpriest\xe2\x80\x99s pretty daughter--which, of\r\ncourse, would put a different complexion on the matter. This theory also\r\nrendered intelligible the protection of the distinguished nobleman. All\r\nthis, however, had never been investigated maliciously or otherwise. No\r\none knew or cared who the nobleman in question was. Razumov received\r\na modest but very sufficient allowance from the hands of an obscure\r\nattorney, who seemed to act as his guardian in some measure. Now and\r\nthen he appeared at some professor\xe2\x80\x99s informal reception. Apart from\r\nthat Razumov was not known to have any social relations in the town.\r\nHe attended the obligatory lectures regularly and was considered by the\r\nauthorities as a very promising student. He worked at home in the manner\r\nof a man who means to get on, but did not shut himself up severely for\r\nthat purpose. He was always accessible, and there was nothing secret or\r\nreserved in his life.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe origin of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s record is connected with an event\r\ncharacteristic of modern Russia in the actual fact: the assassination\r\nof a prominent statesman--and still more characteristic of the moral\r\ncorruption of an oppressed society where the noblest aspirations of\r\nhumanity, the desire of freedom, an ardent patriotism, the love of\r\njustice, the sense of pity, and even the fidelity of simple minds are\r\nprostituted to the lusts of hate and fear, the inseparable companions of\r\nan uneasy despotism.\r\n\r\nThe fact alluded to above is the successful attempt on the life of Mr.\r\nde P---, the President of the notorious Repressive Commission of some\r\nyears ago, the Minister of State invested with extraordinary powers. The\r\nnewspapers made noise enough about that fanatical, narrow-chested figure\r\nin gold-laced uniform, with a face of crumpled parchment, insipid,\r\nbespectacled eyes, and the cross of the Order of St. Procopius hung\r\nunder the skinny throat. For a time, it may be remembered, not a month\r\npassed without his portrait appearing in some one of the illustrated\r\npapers of Europe. He served the monarchy by imprisoning, exiling, or\r\nsending to the gallows men and women, young and old, with an equable,\r\nunwearied industry. In his mystic acceptance of the principle of\r\nautocracy he was bent on extirpating from the land every vestige of\r\nanything that resembled freedom in public institutions; and in his\r\nruthless persecution of the rising generation he seemed to aim at the\r\ndestruction of the very hope of liberty itself.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this execrated personality had not enough imagination\r\nto be aware of the hate he inspired. It is hardly credible; but it is a\r\nfact that he took very few precautions for his safety. In the preamble\r\nof a certain famous State paper he had declared once that \xe2\x80\x9cthe thought\r\nof liberty has never existed in the Act of the Creator. From the\r\nmultitude of men\xe2\x80\x99s counsel nothing could come but revolt and disorder;\r\nand revolt and disorder in a world created for obedience and stability\r\nis sin. It was not Reason but Authority which expressed the Divine\r\nIntention. God was the Autocrat of the Universe....\xe2\x80\x9d It may be that\r\nthe man who made this declaration believed that heaven itself was bound\r\nto protect him in his remorseless defence of Autocracy on this earth.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the vigilance of the police saved him many times; but, as a\r\nmatter of fact, when his appointed fate overtook him, the competent\r\nauthorities could not have given him any warning. They had no knowledge\r\nof any conspiracy against the Minister\xe2\x80\x99s life, had no hint of any plot\r\nthrough their usual channels of information, had seen no signs, were\r\naware of no suspicious movements or dangerous persons.\r\n\r\nMr. de P--- was being driven towards the railway station in a two-horse\r\nuncovered sleigh with footman and coachman on the box. Snow had been\r\nfalling all night, making the roadway, uncleared as yet at this early\r\nhour, very heavy for the horses. It was still falling thickly. But the\r\nsleigh must have been observed and marked down. As it drew over to the\r\nleft before taking a turn, the footman noticed a peasant walking\r\nslowly on the edge of the pavement with his hands in the pockets of\r\nhis sheepskin coat and his shoulders hunched up to his ears under the\r\nfalling snow. On being overtaken this peasant suddenly faced about and\r\nswung his arm. In an instant there was a terrible shock, a detonation\r\nmuffled in the multitude of snowflakes; both horses lay dead and mangled\r\non the ground and the coachman, with a shrill cry, had fallen off the\r\nbox mortally wounded. The footman (who survived) had no time to see the\r\nface of the man in the sheepskin coat. After throwing the bomb this last\r\ngot away, but it is supposed that, seeing a lot of people surging up on\r\nall sides of him in the falling snow, and all running towards the scene\r\nof the explosion, he thought it safer to turn back with them.\r\n\r\nIn an incredibly short time an excited crowd assembled round the sledge.\r\nThe Minister-President, getting out unhurt into the deep snow, stood\r\nnear the groaning coachman and addressed the people repeatedly in his\r\nweak, colourless voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you to keep off: For the love of God,\r\nI beg of you good people to keep off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then that a tall young man who had remained standing perfectly\r\nstill within a carriage gateway, two houses lower down, stepped out into\r\nthe street and walking up rapidly flung another bomb over the heads of\r\nthe crowd. It actually struck the Minister-President on the shoulder\r\nas he stooped over his dying servant, then falling between his feet\r\nexploded with a terrific concentrated violence, striking him dead to the\r\nground, finishing the wounded man and practically annihilating the empty\r\nsledge in the twinkling of an eye. With a yell of horror the crowd broke\r\nup and fled in all directions, except for those who fell dead or dying\r\nwhere they stood nearest to the Minister-President, and one or two\r\nothers who did not fall till they had run a little way.\r\n\r\nThe first explosion had brought together a crowd as if by enchantment,\r\nthe second made as swiftly a solitude in the street for hundreds of\r\nyards in each direction. Through the falling snow people looked from\r\nafar at the small heap of dead bodies lying upon each other near the\r\ncarcases of the two horses. Nobody dared to approach till some Cossacks\r\nof a street-patrol galloped up and, dismounting, began to turn over the\r\ndead. Amongst the innocent victims of the second explosion laid out on\r\nthe pavement there was a body dressed in a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s sheepskin coat; but\r\nthe face was unrecognisable, there was absolutely nothing found in the\r\npockets of its poor clothing, and it was the only one whose identity was\r\nnever established.\r\n\r\nThat day Mr. Razumov got up at his usual hour and spent the morning\r\nwithin the University buildings listening to the lectures and working\r\nfor some time in the library. He heard the first vague rumour of\r\nsomething in the way of bomb-throwing at the table of the students\xe2\x80\x99\r\nordinary, where he was accustomed to eat his two o\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner. But\r\nthis rumour was made up of mere whispers, and this was Russia, where\r\nit was not always safe, for a student especially, to appear too much\r\ninterested in certain kinds of whispers. Razumov was one of those\r\nmen who, living in a period of mental and political unrest, keep an\r\ninstinctive hold on normal, practical, everyday life. He was aware\r\nof the emotional tension of his time; he even responded to it in an\r\nindefinite way. But his main concern was with his work, his studies, and\r\nwith his own future.\r\n\r\nOfficially and in fact without a family (for the daughter of the\r\nArchpriest had long been dead), no home influences had shaped his\r\nopinions or his feelings. He was as lonely in the world as a man\r\nswimming in the deep sea. The word Razumov was the mere label of\r\na solitary individuality. There were no Razumovs belonging to him\r\nanywhere. His closest parentage was defined in the statement that he\r\nwas a Russian. Whatever good he expected from life would be given to or\r\nwithheld from his hopes by that connexion alone. This immense parentage\r\nsuffered from the throes of internal dissensions, and he shrank mentally\r\nfrom the fray as a good-natured man may shrink from taking definite\r\nsides in a violent family quarrel.\r\n\r\nRazumov, going home, reflected that having prepared all the matters of\r\nthe forthcoming examination, he could now devote his time to the subject\r\nof the prize essay. He hankered after the silver medal. The prize was\r\noffered by the Ministry of Education; the names of the competitors would\r\nbe submitted to the Minister himself. The mere fact of trying would be\r\nconsidered meritorious in the higher quarters; and the possessor of the\r\nprize would have a claim to an administrative appointment of the better\r\nsort after he had taken his degree. The student Razumov in an access of\r\nelation forgot the dangers menacing the stability of the institutions\r\nwhich give rewards and appointments. But remembering the medallist of\r\nthe year before, Razumov, the young man of no parentage, was sobered. He\r\nand some others happened to be assembled in their comrade\xe2\x80\x99s rooms at the\r\nvery time when that last received the official advice of his success.\r\nHe was a quiet, unassuming young man: \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said with a\r\nfaint apologetic smile and taking up his cap, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going out to order\r\nup some wine. But I must first send a telegram to my folk at home. I\r\nsay! Won\xe2\x80\x99t the old people make it a festive time for the neighbours for\r\ntwenty miles around our place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov thought there was nothing of that sort for him in the world. His\r\nsuccess would matter to no one. But he felt no bitterness against\r\nthe nobleman his protector, who was not a provincial magnate as was\r\ngenerally supposed. He was in fact nobody less than Prince K---, once\r\na great and splendid figure in the world and now, his day being over,\r\na Senator and a gouty invalid, living in a still splendid but more\r\ndomestic manner. He had some young children and a wife as aristocratic\r\nand proud as himself.\r\n\r\nIn all his life Razumov was allowed only once to come into personal\r\ncontact with the Prince.\r\n\r\nIt had the air of a chance meeting in the little attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\nOne day Razumov, coming in by appointment, found a stranger standing\r\nthere--a tall, aristocratic-looking Personage with silky, grey\r\nsidewhiskers. The bald-headed, sly little lawyer-fellow called out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in--come in, Mr. Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d with a sort of ironic heartiness. Then\r\nturning deferentially to the stranger with the grand air, \xe2\x80\x9cA ward\r\nof mine, your Excellency. One of the most promising students of his\r\nfaculty in the St. Petersburg University.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo his intense surprise Razumov saw a white shapely hand extended to\r\nhim. He took it in great confusion (it was soft and passive) and heard\r\nat the same time a condescending murmur in which he caught only the\r\nwords \xe2\x80\x9cSatisfactory\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPersevere.\xe2\x80\x9d But the most amazing thing of all\r\nwas to feel suddenly a distinct pressure of the white shapely hand\r\njust before it was withdrawn: a light pressure like a secret sign. The\r\nemotion of it was terrible. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s heart seemed to leap into his\r\nthroat. When he raised his eyes the aristocratic personage, motioning\r\nthe little lawyer aside, had opened the door and was going out.\r\n\r\nThe attorney rummaged amongst the papers on his desk for a time. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nknow who that was?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nRazumov, whose heart was thumping hard yet, shook his head in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was Prince K---. You wonder what he could be doing in the hole of\r\na poor legal rat like myself--eh? These awfully great people have their\r\nsentimental curiosities like common sinners. But if I were you, Kirylo\r\nSidorovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, leering and laying a peculiar emphasis on\r\nthe patronymic, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t boast at large of the introduction. It would\r\nnot be prudent, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Oh dear no! It would be in fact\r\ndangerous for your future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man\xe2\x80\x99s ears burned like fire; his sight was dim. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumov was saying to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenceforth it was by this monosyllable that Mr. Razumov got into\r\nthe habit of referring mentally to the stranger with grey silky\r\nside-whiskers. From that time too, when walking in the more fashionable\r\nquarters, he noted with interest the magnificent horses and carriages\r\nwith Prince K---\xe2\x80\x98s liveries on the box. Once he saw the Princess get\r\nout--she was shopping--followed by two girls, of which one was nearly a\r\nhead taller than the other. Their fair hair hung loose down their backs\r\nin the English style; they had merry eyes, their coats, muffs, and\r\nlittle fur caps were exactly alike, and their cheeks and noses were\r\ntinged a cheerful pink by the frost. They crossed the pavement in front\r\nof him, and Razumov went on his way smiling shyly to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHis\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n daughters. They resembled \xe2\x80\x9cHim.\xe2\x80\x9d The young man felt a glow of warm\r\nfriendliness towards these girls who would never know of his existence.\r\nPresently they would marry Generals or Kammerherrs and have girls and\r\nboys of their own, who perhaps would be aware of him as a celebrated old\r\nprofessor, decorated, possibly a Privy Councillor, one of the glories of\r\nRussia--nothing more!\r\n\r\nBut a celebrated professor was a somebody. Distinction would convert the\r\nlabel Razumov into an honoured name. There was nothing strange in\r\nthe student Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s wish for distinction. A man\xe2\x80\x99s real life is that\r\naccorded to him in the thoughts of other men by reason of respect or\r\nnatural love. Returning home on the day of the attempt on Mr. de P---\xe2\x80\x98s\r\nlife Razumov resolved to have a good try for the silver medal.\r\n\r\nClimbing slowly the four flights of the dark, dirty staircase in the\r\nhouse where he had his lodgings, he felt confident of success. The\r\nwinner\xe2\x80\x99s name would be published in the papers on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. And at\r\nthe thought that \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x9d would most probably read it there, Razumov stopped\r\nshort on the stairs for an instant, then went on smiling faintly at his\r\nown emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is but a shadow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the medal\r\nis a solid beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those ideas of industry in his head the warmth of his room was\r\nagreeable and encouraging. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall put in four hours of good work,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he thought. But no sooner had he closed the door than he was horribly\r\nstartled. All black against the usual tall stove of white tiles gleaming\r\nin the dusk, stood a strange figure, wearing a skirted, close-fitting,\r\nbrown cloth coat strapped round the waist, in long boots, and with a\r\nlittle Astrakhan cap on its head. It loomed lithe and martial. Razumov\r\nwas utterly confounded. It was only when the figure advancing two paces\r\nasked in an untroubled, grave voice if the outer door was closed that he\r\nregained his power of speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaldin!... Victor Victorovitch!... Is that you?... Yes. The\r\nouter door is shut all right. But this is indeed unexpected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor Haldin, a student older than most of his contemporaries at the\r\nUniversity, was not one of the industrious set. He was hardly ever seen\r\nat lectures; the authorities had marked him as \xe2\x80\x9crestless\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunsound\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--very bad notes. But he had a great personal prestige with his\r\ncomrades and influenced their thoughts. Razumov had never been intimate\r\nwith him. They had met from time to time at gatherings in other\r\nstudents\xe2\x80\x99 houses. They had even had a discussion together--one of those\r\ndiscussions on first principles dear to the sanguine minds of youth.\r\n\r\nRazumov wished the man had chosen some other time to come for a chat. He\r\nfelt in good trim to tackle the prize essay. But as Haldin could not be\r\nslightingly dismissed Razumov adopted the tone of hospitality, asking\r\nhim to sit down and smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirylo Sidorovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, flinging off his cap, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not\r\nperhaps in exactly the same camp. Your judgment is more philosophical.\r\nYou are a man of few words, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t met anybody who dared to\r\ndoubt the generosity of your sentiments. There is a solidity about your\r\ncharacter which cannot exist without courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov felt flattered and began to murmur shyly something about being\r\nvery glad of his good opinion, when Haldin raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I was saying to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cas I dodged in the\r\nwoodyard down by the river-side. \xe2\x80\x98He has a strong character this young\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself. \xe2\x80\x98He does not throw his soul to the winds.\xe2\x80\x99 Your\r\nreserve has always fascinated me, Kirylo Sidorovitch. So I tried to\r\nremember your address. But look here--it was a piece of luck. Your\r\ndvornik was away from the gate talking to a sleigh-driver on the other\r\nside of the street. I met no one on the stairs, not a soul. As I came up\r\nto your floor I caught sight of your landlady coming out of your rooms.\r\nBut she did not see me. She crossed the landing to her own side, and\r\nthen I slipped in. I have been here two hours expecting you to come in\r\nevery moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had listened in astonishment; but before he could open his mouth\r\nHaldin added, speaking deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was I who removed de P--- this\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov kept down a cry of dismay. The sentiment of his life\r\nbeing utterly ruined by this contact with such a crime expressed itself\r\nquaintly by a sort of half-derisive mental exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cThere goes my\r\nsilver medal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaldin continued after waiting a while--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say nothing, Kirylo Sidorovitch! I understand your silence. To be\r\nsure, I cannot expect you with your frigid English manner to embrace\r\nme. But never mind your manners. You have enough heart to have heard the\r\nsound of weeping and gnashing of teeth this man raised in the land. That\r\nwould be enough to get over any philosophical hopes. He was uprooting\r\nthe tender plant. He had to be stopped. He was a dangerous man--a\r\nconvinced man. Three more years of his work would have put us back fifty\r\nyears into bondage--and look at all the lives wasted, at all the souls\r\nlost in that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis curt, self-confident voice suddenly lost its ring and it was in a\r\ndull tone that he added, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, brother, I have killed him. It\xe2\x80\x99s weary\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had sunk into a chair. Every moment he expected a crowd of\r\npolicemen to rush in. There must have been thousands of them out looking\r\nfor that man walking up and down in his room. Haldin was talking again\r\nin a restrained, steady voice. Now and then he flourished an arm,\r\nslowly, without excitement.\r\n\r\nHe told Razumov how he had brooded for a year; how he had not slept\r\nproperly for weeks. He and \xe2\x80\x9cAnother\xe2\x80\x9d had a warning of the Minister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovements from \xe2\x80\x9ca certain person\xe2\x80\x9d late the evening before. He and that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother\xe2\x80\x9d prepared their \xe2\x80\x9cengines\xe2\x80\x9d and resolved to have no sleep till\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe deed\xe2\x80\x9d was done. They walked the streets under the falling snow with\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cengines\xe2\x80\x9d on them, exchanging not a word the livelong night. When\r\nthey happened to meet a police patrol they took each other by the arm\r\nand pretended to be a couple of peasants on the spree. They reeled and\r\ntalked in drunken hoarse voices. Except for these strange outbreaks they\r\nkept silence, moving on ceaselessly. Their plans had been previously\r\narranged. At daybreak they made their way to the spot which they\r\nknew the sledge must pass. When it appeared in sight they exchanged a\r\nmuttered good-bye and separated. The \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d remained at the corner,\r\nHaldin took up a position a little farther up the street....\r\n\r\nAfter throwing his \xe2\x80\x9cengine\xe2\x80\x9d he ran off and in a moment was overtaken\r\nby the panic-struck people flying away from the spot after the second\r\nexplosion. They were wild with terror. He was jostled once or twice. He\r\nslowed down for the rush to pass him and then turned to the left into a\r\nnarrow street. There he was alone.\r\n\r\nHe marvelled at this immediate escape. The work was done. He could\r\nhardly believe it. He fought with an almost irresistible longing to lie\r\ndown on the pavement and sleep. But this sort of faintness--a drowsy\r\nfaintness--passed off quickly. He walked faster, making his way to one\r\nof the poorer parts of the town in order to look up Ziemianitch.\r\n\r\nThis Ziemianitch, Razumov understood, was a sort of town-peasant who had\r\ngot on; owner of a small number of sledges and horses for hire. Haldin\r\npaused in his narrative to exclaim--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bright spirit! A hardy soul! The best driver in St. Petersburg. He\r\nhas a team of three horses there.... Ah! He\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis man had declared himself willing to take out safely, at any time,\r\none or two persons to the second or third railway station on one of the\r\nsouthern lines. But there had been no time to warn him the night before.\r\nHis usual haunt seemed to be a low-class eating-house on the outskirts\r\nof the town. When Haldin got there the man was not to be found. He was\r\nnot expected to turn up again till the evening. Haldin wandered away\r\nrestlessly.\r\n\r\nHe saw the gate of a woodyard open and went in to get out of the wind\r\nwhich swept the bleak broad thoroughfare. The great rectangular piles of\r\ncut wood loaded with snow resembled the huts of a village. At first the\r\nwatchman who discovered him crouching amongst them talked in a friendly\r\nmanner. He was a dried-up old man wearing two ragged army coats one over\r\nthe other; his wizened little face, tied up under the jaw and over the\r\nears in a dirty red handkerchief, looked comical. Presently he grew\r\nsulky, and then all at once without rhyme or reason began to shout\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you ever going to clear out of this, you loafer? We know all\r\nabout factory hands of your sort. A big, strong, young chap! You aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven drunk. What do you want here? You don\xe2\x80\x99t frighten us. Take yourself\r\nand your ugly eyes away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaldin stopped before the sitting Razumov. His supple figure, with\r\nthe white forehead above which the fair hair stood straight up, had an\r\naspect of lofty daring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not like my eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so...here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov made an effort to speak calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut pardon me, Victor Victorovitch. We know each other so little....\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haldin.\r\n\r\nThis word sealed Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s lips as if a hand had been clapped on his\r\nmouth. His brain seethed with arguments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so--here you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered through his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe other did not detect the tone of anger. Never suspected it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And nobody knows I am here. You are the last person that could\r\nbe suspected--should I get caught. That\xe2\x80\x99s an advantage, you see. And\r\nthen--speaking to a superior mind like yours I can well say all the\r\ntruth. It occurred to me that you--you have no one belonging to you--no\r\nties, no one to suffer for it if this came out by some means. There\r\nhave been enough ruined Russian homes as it is. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how my\r\npassage through your rooms can be ever known. If I should be got hold\r\nof, I\xe2\x80\x99ll know how to keep silent--no matter what they may be pleased to\r\ndo to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added grimly.\r\n\r\nHe began to walk again while Razumov sat still appalled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought that--\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered out almost sick with indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Razumov. Yes, brother. Some day you shall help to build. You\r\nsuppose that I am a terrorist, now--a destructor of what is, But\r\nconsider that the true destroyers are they who destroy the spirit of\r\nprogress and truth, not the avengers who merely kill the bodies of the\r\npersecutors of human dignity. Men like me are necessary to make room for\r\nself-contained, thinking men like you. Well, we have made the sacrifice\r\nof our lives, but all the same I want to escape if it can be done. It\r\nis not my life I want to save, but my power to do. I won\xe2\x80\x99t live idle. Oh\r\nno! Don\xe2\x80\x99t make any mistake, Razumov. Men like me are rare. And, besides,\r\nan example like this is more awful to oppressors when the perpetrator\r\nvanishes without a trace. They sit in their offices and palaces and\r\nquake. All I want you to do is to help me to vanish. No great matter\r\nthat. Only to go by and by and see Ziemianitch for me at that place\r\nwhere I went this morning. Just tell him, \xe2\x80\x98He whom you know wants a\r\nwell-horsed sledge to pull up half an hour after midnight at the seventh\r\nlamp-post on the left counting from the upper end of Karabelnaya. If\r\nnobody gets in, the sledge is to run round a block or two, so as to come\r\nback past the same spot in ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov wondered why he had not cut short that talk and told this man to\r\ngo away long before. Was it weakness or what?\r\n\r\nHe concluded that it was a sound instinct. Haldin must have been seen.\r\nIt was impossible that some people should not have noticed the face and\r\nappearance of the man who threw the second bomb. Haldin was a noticeable\r\nperson. The police in their thousands must have had his description\r\nwithin the hour. With every moment the danger grew. Sent out to wander\r\nin the streets he could not escape being caught in the end.\r\n\r\nThe police would very soon find out all about him. They would set about\r\ndiscovering a conspiracy. Everybody Haldin had ever known would be in\r\nthe greatest danger. Unguarded expressions, little facts in themselves\r\ninnocent would be counted for crimes. Razumov remembered certain words\r\nhe said, the speeches he had listened to, the harmless gatherings he\r\nhad attended--it was almost impossible for a student to keep out of that\r\nsort of thing, without becoming suspect to his comrades.\r\n\r\nRazumov saw himself shut up in a fortress, worried, badgered, perhaps\r\nill-used. He saw himself deported by an administrative order, his life\r\nbroken, ruined, and robbed of all hope. He saw himself--at best--leading\r\na miserable existence under police supervision, in some small, faraway\r\nprovincial town, without friends to assist his necessities or even\r\ntake any steps to alleviate his lot--as others had. Others had fathers,\r\nmothers, brothers, relations, connexions, to move heaven and earth on\r\ntheir behalf--he had no one. The very officials that sentenced him some\r\nmorning would forget his existence before sunset.\r\n\r\nHe saw his youth pass away from him in misery and half starvation--his\r\nstrength give way, his mind become an abject thing. He saw himself\r\ncreeping, broken down and shabby, about the streets--dying unattended\r\nin some filthy hole of a room, or on the sordid bed of a Government\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered. Then the peace of bitter calmness came over him. It was\r\nbest to keep this man out of the streets till he could be got rid of\r\nwith some chance of escaping. That was the best that could be done.\r\nRazumov, of course, felt the safety of his lonely existence to be\r\npermanently endangered. This evening\xe2\x80\x99s doings could turn up against\r\nhim at any time as long as this man lived and the present institutions\r\nendured. They appeared to him rational and indestructible at that\r\nmoment. They had a force of harmony--in contrast with the horrible\r\ndiscord of this man\xe2\x80\x99s presence. He hated the man. He said quietly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course, I will go. \xe2\x80\x98You must give me precise directions, and\r\nfor the rest--depend on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You are a fellow! Collected--cool as a cucumber. A regular\r\nEnglishman. Where did you get your soul from? There aren\xe2\x80\x99t many like\r\nyou. Look here, brother! Men like me leave no posterity, but their souls\r\nare not lost. No man\xe2\x80\x99s soul is ever lost. It works for itself--or else\r\nwhere would be the sense of self-sacrifice, of martyrdom, of conviction,\r\nof faith--the labours of the soul? What will become of my soul when I\r\ndie in the way I must die--soon--very soon perhaps? It shall not perish.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t make a mistake, Razumov. This is not murder--it is war, war. My\r\nspirit shall go on warring in some Russian body till all falsehood is\r\nswept out of the world. The modern civilization is false, but a new\r\nrevelation shall come out of Russia. Ha! you say nothing. You are a\r\nsceptic. I respect your philosophical scepticism, Razumov, but don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntouch the soul. The Russian soul that lives in all of us. It has a\r\nfuture. It has a mission, I tell you, or else why should I have been\r\nmoved to do this--reckless--like a butcher--in the middle of all these\r\ninnocent people--scattering death--I! I!... I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt a fly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so loud,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Razumov harshly.\r\n\r\nHaldin sat down abruptly, and leaning his head on his folded arms burst\r\ninto tears. He wept for a long time. The dusk had deepened in the room.\r\nRazumov, motionless in sombre wonder, listened to the sobs.\r\n\r\nThe other raised his head, got up and with an effort mastered his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Men like me leave no posterity,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated in a subdued tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a sister though. She\xe2\x80\x99s with my old mother--I persuaded them to\r\ngo abroad this year--thank God. Not a bad little girl my sister. She has\r\nthe most trustful eyes of any human being that ever walked this earth.\r\nShe will marry well, I hope. She may have children--sons perhaps. Look\r\nat me. My father was a Government official in the provinces, He had a\r\nlittle land too. A simple servant of God--a true Russian in his way. His\r\nwas the soul of obedience. But I am not like him. They say I resemble\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s eldest brother, an officer. They shot him in \xe2\x80\x9828. Under\r\nNicholas, you know. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you that this is war, war.... But\r\nGod of Justice! This is weary work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, in his chair, leaning his head on his hand, spoke as if from\r\nthe bottom of an abyss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe in God, Haldin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go catching at words that are wrung from one. What does it\r\nmatter? What was it the Englishman said: \xe2\x80\x98There is a divine soul in\r\nthings...\xe2\x80\x99 Devil take him--I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember now. But he spoke the\r\ntruth. When the day of you thinkers comes don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndivine in the Russian soul--and that\xe2\x80\x99s resignation. Respect that in your\r\nintellectual restlessness and don\xe2\x80\x99t let your arrogant wisdom spoil its\r\nmessage to the world. I am speaking to you now like a man with a rope\r\nround his neck. What do you imagine I am? A being in revolt? No. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyou thinkers who are in everlasting revolt. I am one of the resigned.\r\nWhen the necessity of this heavy work came to me and I understood that\r\nit had to be done--what did I do? Did I exult? Did I take pride in\r\nmy purpose? Did I try to weigh its worth and consequences? No! I was\r\nresigned. I thought \xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s will be done.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw himself full length on Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s bed and putting the backs of\r\nhis hands over his eyes remained perfectly motionless and silent. Not\r\neven the sound of his breathing could be heard. The dead stillness\r\nor the room remained undisturbed till in the darkness Razumov said\r\ngloomily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaldin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other readily, quite invisible now on the bed and\r\nwithout the slightest stir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it time for me to start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d The other was heard, lying still in the darkness as\r\nthough he were talking in his sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come to put fate to\r\nthe test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, then gave a few lucid directions in the quiet impersonal\r\nvoice of a man in a trance. Razumov made ready without a word of answer.\r\nAs he was leaving the room the voice on the bed said after him--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo with God, thou silent soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the landing, moving softly, Razumov locked the door and put the key\r\nin his pocket.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe words and events of that evening must have been graven as if with\r\na steel tool on Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s brain since he was able to write his\r\nrelation with such fullness and precision a good many months afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe record of the thoughts which assailed him in the street is even more\r\nminute and abundant. They seem to have rushed upon him with the greater\r\nfreedom because his thinking powers were no longer crushed by Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence--the appalling presence of a great crime and the stunning force\r\nof a great fanaticism. On looking through the pages of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiary I own that a \xe2\x80\x9crush of thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d is not an adequate image.\r\n\r\nThe more adequate description would be a tumult of thoughts--the\r\nfaithful reflection of the state of his feelings. The thoughts in\r\nthemselves were not numerous--they were like the thoughts of most human\r\nbeings, few and simple--but they cannot be reproduced here in all\r\ntheir exclamatory repetitions which went on in an endless and weary\r\nturmoil--for the walk was long.\r\n\r\nIf to the Western reader they appear shocking, inappropriate, or even\r\nimproper, it must be remembered that as to the first this may be the\r\neffect of my crude statement. For the rest I will only remark here that\r\nthis is not a story of the West of Europe.\r\n\r\nNations it may be have fashioned their Governments, but the Governments\r\nhave paid them back in the same coin. It is unthinkable that any young\r\nEnglishman should find himself in Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s situation. This being so it\r\nwould be a vain enterprise to imagine what he would think. The only safe\r\nsurmise to make is that he would not think as Mr. Razumov thought at\r\nthis crisis of his fate. He would not have an hereditary and personal\r\nknowledge or the means by which historical autocracy represses ideas,\r\nguards its power, and defends its existence. By an act of mental\r\nextravagance he might imagine himself arbitrarily thrown into prison,\r\nbut it would never occur to him unless he were delirious (and perhaps\r\nnot even then) that he could be beaten with whips as a practical measure\r\neither of investigation or of punishment.\r\n\r\nThis is but a crude and obvious example of the different conditions of\r\nWestern thought. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that this danger occurred, specially, to\r\nMr. Razumov. No doubt it entered unconsciously into the general dread\r\nand the general appallingness of this crisis. Razumov, as has been seen,\r\nwas aware of more subtle ways in which an individual may be undone by\r\nthe proceedings of a despotic Government. A simple expulsion from\r\nthe University (the very least that could happen to him), with an\r\nimpossibility to continue his studies anywhere, was enough to ruin\r\nutterly a young man depending entirely upon the development of his\r\nnatural abilities for his place in the world. He was a Russian: and for\r\nhim to be implicated meant simply sinking into the lowest social depths\r\namongst the hopeless and the destitute--the night birds of the city.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar circumstances of Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s parentage, or rather of his lack\r\nof parentage, should be taken into the account of his thoughts. And he\r\nremembered them too. He had been lately reminded of them in a peculiarly\r\natrocious way by this fatal Haldin. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I haven\xe2\x80\x99t that, must\r\neverything else be taken away from me?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nHe nerved himself for another effort to go on. Along the roadway sledges\r\nglided phantom-like and jingling through a fluttering whiteness on the\r\nblack face of the night. \xe2\x80\x9cFor it is a crime,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cA murder is a murder. Though, of course, some sort of liberal\r\ninstitutions....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA feeling of horrible sickness came over him. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be courageous,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he exhorted himself mentally. All his strength was suddenly gone as\r\nif taken out by a hand. Then by a mighty effort of will it came back\r\nbecause he was afraid of fainting in the street and being picked up by\r\nthe police with the key of his lodgings in his pocket. They would find\r\nHaldin there, and then, indeed, he would be undone.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough it was this fear which seems to have kept him up to the\r\nend. The passers-by were rare. They came upon him suddenly, looming up\r\nblack in the snowflakes close by, then vanishing all at once-without\r\nfootfalls.\r\n\r\nIt was the quarter of the very poor. Razumov noticed an elderly woman\r\ntied up in ragged shawls. Under the street lamp she seemed a beggar off\r\nduty. She walked leisurely in the blizzard as though she had no home to\r\nhurry to, she hugged under one arm a round loaf of black bread with\r\nan air of guarding a priceless booty: and Razumov averting his glance\r\nenvied her the peace of her mind and the serenity of her fate.\r\n\r\nTo one reading Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s narrative it is really a wonder how he\r\nmanaged to keep going as he did along one interminable street after\r\nanother on pavements that were gradually becoming blocked with snow.\r\nIt was the thought of Haldin locked up in his rooms and the desperate\r\ndesire to get rid of his presence which drove him forward. No rational\r\ndetermination had any part in his exertions. Thus, when on arriving at\r\nthe low eating-house he heard that the man of horses, Ziemianitch, was\r\nnot there, he could only stare stupidly.\r\n\r\nThe waiter, a wild-haired youth in tarred boots and a pink shirt,\r\nexclaimed, uncovering his pale gums in a silly grin, that Ziemianitch\r\nhad got his skinful early in the afternoon and had gone away with a\r\nbottle under each arm to keep it up amongst the horses--he supposed.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the vile den, a bony short man in a dirty cloth caftan\r\ncoming down to his heels, stood by, his hands tucked into his belt, and\r\nnodded confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe reek of spirits, the greasy rancid steam of food got Razumov by the\r\nthroat. He struck a table with his clenched hand and shouted violently--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBleary unwashed faces were turned to his direction. A mild-eyed ragged\r\ntramp drinking tea at the next table moved farther away. A murmur of\r\nwonder arose with an undertone of uneasiness. A laugh was heard too, and\r\nan exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cThere! there!\xe2\x80\x9d jeeringly soothing. The waiter looked\r\nall round and announced to the room--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman won\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Ziemianitch is drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a distant corner a hoarse voice belonging to a horrible,\r\nnondescript, shaggy being with a black face like the muzzle of a bear\r\ngrunted angrily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cursed driver of thieves. What do we want with his gentlemen here?\r\nWe are all honest folk in this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, biting his lip till blood came to keep himself from bursting\r\ninto imprecations, followed the owner of the den, who, whispering \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nalong, little father,\xe2\x80\x9d led him into a tiny hole of a place behind\r\nthe wooden counter, whence proceeded a sound of splashing. A wet and\r\nbedraggled creature, a sort of sexless and shivering scarecrow, washed\r\nglasses in there, bending over a wooden tub by the light of a tallow\r\ndip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, little father,\xe2\x80\x9d the man in the long caftan said plaintively. He\r\nhad a brown, cunning little face, a thin greyish beard. Trying to light\r\na tin lantern he hugged it to his breast and talked garrulously the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nHe would show Ziemianitch to the gentleman to prove there were no lies\r\ntold. And he would show him drunk. His woman, it seems, ran away from\r\nhim last night. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a hag she was! Thin! Pfui!\xe2\x80\x9d He spat. They were\r\nalways running away from that driver of the devil--and he sixty years\r\nold too; could never get used to it. But each heart knows sorrow after\r\nits own kind and Ziemianitch was a born fool all his days. And then he\r\nwould fly to the bottle. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who could bear life in our land without the\r\nbottle?\xe2\x80\x99 he says. A proper Russian man--the little pig.... Be pleased\r\nto follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov crossed a quadrangle of deep snow enclosed between high walls\r\nwith innumerable windows. Here and there a dim yellow light hung within\r\nthe four-square mass of darkness. The house was an enormous slum, a hive\r\nof human vermin, a monumental abode of misery towering on the verge of\r\nstarvation and despair.\r\n\r\nIn a corner the ground sloped sharply down, and Razumov followed the\r\nlight of the lantern through a small doorway into a long cavernous place\r\nlike a neglected subterranean byre. Deep within, three shaggy little\r\nhorses tied up to rings hung their heads together, motionless and\r\nshadowy in the dim light of the lantern. It must have been the famous\r\nteam of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s escape. Razumov peered fearfully into the gloom. His\r\nguide pawed in the straw with his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is. Ah! the little pigeon. A true Russian man. \xe2\x80\x98No heavy hearts\r\nfor me,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Bring out the bottle and take your ugly mug out of my\r\nsight.\xe2\x80\x99 Ha! ha! ha! That\xe2\x80\x99s the fellow he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held the lantern over a prone form of a man, apparently fully dressed\r\nfor outdoors. His head was lost in a pointed cloth hood. On the other\r\nside of a heap of straw protruded a pair of feet in monstrous thick\r\nboots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways ready to drive,\xe2\x80\x9d commented the keeper of the eating-house. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nproper Russian driver that. Saint or devil, night or day is all one to\r\nZiemianitch when his heart is free from sorrow. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask who you\r\nare, but where you want to go,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. He would drive Satan himself to\r\nhis own abode and come back chirruping to his horses. Many a one he has\r\ndriven who is clanking his chains in the Nertchinsk mines by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him, wake him up,\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered out.\r\n\r\nThe other set down his light, stepped back and launched a kick at the\r\nprostrate sleeper. The man shook at the impact but did not move. At the\r\nthird kick he grunted but remained inert as before.\r\n\r\nThe eating-house keeper desisted and fetched a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see for yourself how it is. We have done what we can for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up the lantern. The intense black spokes of shadow swung\r\nabout in the circle of light. A terrible fury--the blind rage of\r\nself-preservation--possessed Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! The vile beast,\xe2\x80\x9d he bellowed out in an unearthly tone which made\r\nthe lantern jump and tremble! \xe2\x80\x9cI shall wake you! Give me...give\r\nme...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round wildly, seized the handle of a stablefork and rushing\r\nforward struck at the prostrate body with inarticulate cries. After a\r\ntime his cries ceased, and the rain of blows fell in the stillness and\r\nshadows of the cellar-like stable. Razumov belaboured Ziemianitch with\r\nan insatiable fury, in great volleys of sounding thwacks. Except for the\r\nviolent movements of Razumov nothing stirred, neither the beaten man\r\nnor the spoke-like shadows on the walls. And only the sound of blows was\r\nheard. It was a weird scene.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a sharp crack. The stick broke and half of it flew\r\nfar away into the gloom beyond the light. At the same time Ziemianitch\r\nsat up. At this Razumov became as motionless as the man with the\r\nlantern--only his breast heaved for air as if ready to burst.\r\n\r\nSome dull sensation of pain must have penetrated at last the consoling\r\nnight of drunkenness enwrapping the \xe2\x80\x9cbright Russian soul\xe2\x80\x9d of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenthusiastic praise. But Ziemianitch evidently saw nothing. His eyeballs\r\nblinked all white in the light once, twice--then the gleam went out.\r\nFor a moment he sat in the straw with closed eyes with a strange air of\r\nweary meditation, then fell over slowly on his side without making the\r\nslightest sound. Only the straw rustled a little. Razumov stared wildly,\r\nfighting for his breath. After a second or two he heard a light snore.\r\n\r\nHe flung from him the piece of stick remaining in his grasp, and went\r\noff with great hasty strides without looking back once.\r\n\r\nAfter going heedlessly for some fifty yards along the street he walked\r\ninto a snowdrift and was up to his knees before he stopped.\r\n\r\nThis recalled him to himself; and glancing about he discovered he had\r\nbeen going in the wrong direction. He retraced his steps, but now at a\r\nmore moderate pace. When passing before the house he had just left he\r\nflourished his fist at the sombre refuge of misery and crime rearing its\r\nsinister bulk on the white ground. It had an air of brooding. He let his\r\narm fall by his side--discouraged.\r\n\r\nZiemianitch\xe2\x80\x99s passionate surrender to sorrow and consolation had baffled\r\nhim. That was the people. A true Russian man! Razumov was glad he had\r\nbeaten that brute--the \xe2\x80\x9cbright soul\xe2\x80\x9d of the other. Here they were: the\r\npeople and the enthusiast.\r\n\r\nBetween the two he was done for. Between the drunkenness of the peasant\r\nincapable of action and the dream-intoxication of the idealist incapable\r\nof perceiving the reason of things, and the true character of men. It\r\nwas a sort of terrible childishness. But children had their masters.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the stick, the stick, the stern hand,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov, longing for\r\npower to hurt and destroy.\r\n\r\nHe was glad he had thrashed that brute. The physical exertion had left\r\nhis body in a comfortable glow. His mental agitation too was clarified\r\nas if all the feverishness had gone out of him in a fit of outward\r\nviolence. Together with the persisting sense of terrible danger he was\r\nconscious now of a tranquil, unquenchable hate.\r\n\r\nHe walked slower and slower. And indeed, considering the guest he had\r\nin his rooms, it was no wonder he lingered on the way. It was like\r\nharbouring a pestilential disease that would not perhaps take your life,\r\nbut would take from you all that made life worth living--a subtle pest\r\nthat would convert earth into a hell.\r\n\r\nWhat was he doing now? Lying on the bed as if dead, with the back of his\r\nhands over his eyes? Razumov had a morbidly vivid vision of Haldin on\r\nhis bed--the white pillow hollowed by the head, the legs in long boots,\r\nthe upturned feet. And in his abhorrence he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kill\r\nhim when I get home.\xe2\x80\x9d But he knew very well that that was of no use.\r\nThe corpse hanging round his neck would be nearly as fatal as the living\r\nman. Nothing short of complete annihilation would do. And that was\r\nimpossible. What then? Must one kill oneself to escape this visitation?\r\n\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s despair was too profoundly tinged with hate to accept that\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was despair--nothing less--at the thought of having to live\r\nwith Haldin for an indefinite number of days in mortal alarm at every\r\nsound. But perhaps when he heard that this \xe2\x80\x9cbright soul\xe2\x80\x9d of Ziemianitch\r\nsuffered from a drunken eclipse the fellow would take his infernal\r\nresignation somewhere else. And that was not likely on the face of it.\r\n\r\nRazumov thought: \xe2\x80\x9cI am being crushed--and I can\xe2\x80\x99t even run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Other men had somewhere a corner of the earth--some little house in\r\nthe provinces where they had a right to take their troubles. A material\r\nrefuge. He had nothing. He had not even a moral refuge--the refuge of\r\nconfidence. To whom could he go with this tale--in all this great, great\r\nland?\r\n\r\nRazumov stamped his foot--and under the soft carpet of snow felt the\r\nhard ground of Russia, inanimate, cold, inert, like a sullen and tragic\r\nmother hiding her face under a winding-sheet--his native soil!--his very\r\nown--without a fireside, without a heart!\r\n\r\nHe cast his eyes upwards and stood amazed. The snow had ceased to fall,\r\nand now, as if by a miracle, he saw above his head the clear black sky\r\nof the northern winter, decorated with the sumptuous fires of the stars.\r\nIt was a canopy fit for the resplendent purity of the snows.\r\n\r\nRazumov received an almost physical impression of endless space and of\r\ncountless millions.\r\n\r\nHe responded to it with the readiness of a Russian who is born to an\r\ninheritance of space and numbers. Under the sumptuous immensity of the\r\nsky, the snow covered the endless forests, the frozen rivers, the plains\r\nof an immense country, obliterating the landmarks, the accidents of\r\nthe ground, levelling everything under its uniform whiteness, like a\r\nmonstrous blank page awaiting the record of an inconceivable history.\r\nIt covered the passive land with its lives of countless people like\r\nZiemianitch and its handful of agitators like this Haldin--murdering\r\nfoolishly.\r\n\r\nIt was a sort of sacred inertia. Razumov felt a respect for it. A\r\nvoice seemed to cry within him, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch it.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a guarantee of\r\nduration, of safety, while the travail of maturing destiny went on--a\r\nwork not of revolutions with their passionate levity of action and their\r\nshifting impulses--but of peace. What it needed was not the conflicting\r\naspirations of a people, but a will strong and one: it wanted not the\r\nbabble of many voices, but a man--strong and one!\r\n\r\nRazumov stood on the point of conversion. He was fascinated by its\r\napproach, by its overpowering logic. For a train of thought is never\r\nfalse. The falsehood lies deep in the necessities of existence, in\r\nsecret fears and half-formed ambitions, in the secret confidence\r\ncombined with a secret mistrust of ourselves, in the love of hope and\r\nthe dread of uncertain days.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, the land of spectral ideas and disembodied aspirations, many\r\nbrave minds have turned away at last from the vain and endless conflict\r\nto the one great historical fact of the land. They turned to autocracy\r\nfor the peace of their patriotic conscience as a weary unbeliever,\r\ntouched by grace, turns to the faith of his fathers for the blessing\r\nof spiritual rest. Like other Russians before him, Razumov, in conflict\r\nwith himself, felt the touch of grace upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaldin means disruption,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, beginning to walk\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he with his indignation, with his talk of bondage--with\r\nhis talk of God\xe2\x80\x99s justice? All that means disruption. Better that\r\nthousands should suffer than that a people should become a disintegrated\r\nmass, helpless like dust in the wind. Obscurantism is better than the\r\nlight of incendiary torches. The seed germinates in the night. Out of\r\nthe dark soil springs the perfect plant. But a volcanic eruption\r\nis sterile, the ruin of the fertile ground. And am I, who love my\r\ncountry--who have nothing but that to love and put my faith in--am I\r\nto have my future, perhaps my usefulness, ruined by this sanguinary\r\nfanatic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grace entered into Razumov. He believed now in the man who would\r\ncome at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nWhat is a throne? A few pieces of wood upholstered in velvet. But a\r\nthrone is a seat of power too. The form of government is the shape of\r\na tool--an instrument. But twenty thousand bladders inflated by the\r\nnoblest sentiments and jostling against each other in the air are a\r\nmiserable incumbrance of space, holding no power, possessing no will,\r\nhaving nothing to give.\r\n\r\nHe went on thus, heedless of the way, holding a discourse with himself\r\nwith extraordinary abundance and facility. Generally his phrases came\r\nto him slowly, after a conscious and painstaking wooing. Some superior\r\npower had inspired him with a flow of masterly argument as certain\r\nconverted sinners become overwhelmingly loquacious.\r\n\r\nHe felt an austere exultation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are the luridly smoky lucubrations of that fellow to the clear\r\ngrasp of my intellect?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIs not this my country? Have I not\r\ngot forty million brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, unanswerably victorious\r\nin the silence of his breast. And the fearful thrashing he had given\r\nthe inanimate Ziemianitch seemed to him a sign of intimate union, a\r\npathetically severe necessity of brotherly love. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! If I must suffer\r\nlet me at least suffer for my convictions, not for a crime my reason--my\r\ncool superior reason--rejects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased to think for a moment. The silence in his breast was complete.\r\nBut he felt a suspicious uneasiness, such as we may experience when we\r\nenter an unlighted strange place--the irrational feeling that something\r\nmay jump upon us in the dark--the absurd dread of the unseen.\r\n\r\nOf course he was far from being a moss-grown reactionary. Everything was\r\nnot for the best. Despotic bureaucracy... abuses... corruption...\r\nand so on. Capable men were wanted. Enlightened intelligences. Devoted\r\nhearts. But absolute power should be preserved--the tool ready for the\r\nman--for the great autocrat of the future. Razumov believed in him. The\r\nlogic of history made him unavoidable. The state of the people demanded\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself ardently, \xe2\x80\x9ccould move all that mass\r\nin one direction? Nothing could. Nothing but a single will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was persuaded that he was sacrificing his personal longings of\r\nliberalism--rejecting the attractive error for the stern Russian truth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s patriotism,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed mentally, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nstopping midway on that road,\xe2\x80\x9d and then remarked to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a\r\ncoward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again there was a dead silence in Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s breast. He walked with\r\nlowered head, making room for no one. He walked slowly and his thoughts\r\nreturning spoke within him with solemn slowness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this Haldin? And what am I? Only two grains of sand. But a\r\ngreat mountain is made up of just such insignificant grains. And the\r\ndeath of a man or of many men is an insignificant thing. Yet we combat\r\na contagious pestilence. Do I want his death? No! I would save him if I\r\ncould--but no one can do that--he is the withered member which must be\r\ncut off. If I must perish through him, let me at least not perish\r\nwith him, and associated against my will with his sombre folly that\r\nunderstands nothing either of men or things. Why should I leave a false\r\nmemory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt passed through his mind that there was no one in the world who\r\ncared what sort of memory he left behind him. He exclaimed to himself\r\ninstantly, \xe2\x80\x9cPerish vainly for a falsehood!... What a miserable fate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was now in a more animated part of the town. He did not remark the\r\ncrash of two colliding sledges close to the curb. The driver of one\r\nbellowed tearfully at his fellow--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thou vile wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis hoarse yell, let out nearly in his ear, disturbed Razumov. He shook\r\nhis head impatiently and went on looking straight before him. Suddenly\r\non the snow, stretched on his back right across his path, he saw Haldin,\r\nsolid, distinct, real, with his inverted hands over his eyes, clad in a\r\nbrown close-fitting coat and long boots. He was lying out of the way a\r\nlittle, as though he had selected that place on purpose. The snow round\r\nhim was untrodden.\r\n\r\nThis hallucination had such a solidity of aspect that the first movement\r\nof Razumov was to reach for his pocket to assure himself that the key of\r\nhis rooms was there. But he checked the impulse with a disdainful curve\r\nof his lips. He understood. His thought, concentrated intensely on\r\nthe figure left lying on his bed, had culminated in this extraordinary\r\nillusion of the sight. Razumov tackled the phenomenon calmly. With a\r\nstern face, without a check and gazing far beyond the vision, he walked\r\non, experiencing nothing but a slight tightening of the chest. After\r\npassing he turned his head for a glance, and saw only the unbroken track\r\nof his footsteps over the place where the breast of the phantom had been\r\nlying.\r\n\r\nRazumov walked on and after a little time whispered his wonder to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly as if alive! Seemed to breathe! And right in my way too! I have\r\nhad an extraordinary experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a few steps and muttered through his set teeth--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall give him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen for some twenty yards or more all was blank. He wrapped his cloak\r\ncloser round him. He pulled his cap well forward over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetray. A great word. What is betrayal? They talk of a man betraying\r\nhis country, his friends, his sweetheart. There must be a moral bond\r\nfirst. All a man can betray is his conscience. And how is my conscience\r\nengaged here; by what bond of common faith, of common conviction, am\r\nI obliged to let that fanatical idiot drag me down with him? On the\r\ncontrary--every obligation of true courage is the other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov looked round from under his cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can the prejudice of the world reproach me with? Have I provoked\r\nhis confidence? No! Have I by a single word, look, or gesture given him\r\nreason to suppose that I accepted his trust in me? No! It is true that\r\nI consented to go and see his Ziemianitch. Well, I have been to see him.\r\nAnd I broke a stick on his back too--the brute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to turn over in his head bringing uppermost a\r\nsingularly hard, clear facet of his brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better, however,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected with a quite different\r\nmental accent, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep that circumstance altogether to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had passed beyond the turn leading to his lodgings, and had reached\r\na wide and fashionable street. Some shops were still open, and all the\r\nrestaurants. Lights fell on the pavement where men in expensive fur\r\ncoats, with here and there the elegant figure of a woman, walked with an\r\nair of leisure. Razumov looked at them with the contempt of an austere\r\nbeliever for the frivolous crowd. It was the world--those officers,\r\ndignitaries, men of fashion, officials, members of the Yacht Club. The\r\nevent of the morning affected them all. What would they say if they knew\r\nwhat this student in a cloak was going to do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one of them is capable of feeling and thinking as deeply as I can.\r\nHow many of them could accomplish an act of conscience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov lingered in the well-lighted street. He was firmly decided.\r\nIndeed, it could hardly be called a decision. He had simply discovered\r\nwhat he had meant to do all along. And yet he felt the need of some\r\nother mind\xe2\x80\x99s sanction.\r\n\r\nWith something resembling anguish he said to himself--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be understood.\xe2\x80\x9d The universal aspiration with all its\r\nprofound and melancholy meaning assailed heavily Razumov, who, amongst\r\neighty millions of his kith and kin, had no heart to which he could open\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe attorney was not to be thought of. He despised the little agent of\r\nchicane too much. One could not go and lay one\xe2\x80\x99s conscience before the\r\npoliceman at the corner. Neither was Razumov anxious to go to the chief\r\nof his district\xe2\x80\x99s police--a common-looking person whom he used to see\r\nsometimes in the street in a shabby uniform and with a smouldering\r\ncigarette stuck to his lower lip. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would begin by locking me up most\r\nprobably. At any rate, he is certain to get excited and create an awful\r\ncommotion,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov practically.\r\n\r\nAn act of conscience must be done with outward dignity.\r\n\r\nRazumov longed desperately for a word of advice, for moral support. Who\r\nknows what true loneliness is--not the conventional word, but the naked\r\nterror? To the lonely themselves it wears a mask. The most miserable\r\noutcast hugs some memory or some illusion. Now and then a fatal\r\nconjunction of events may lift the veil for an instant. For an instant\r\nonly. No human being could bear a steady view of moral solitude without\r\ngoing mad.\r\n\r\nRazumov had reached that point of vision. To escape from it he embraced\r\nfor a whole minute the delirious purpose of rushing to his lodgings\r\nand flinging himself on his knees by the side of the bed with the dark\r\nfigure stretched on it; to pour out a full confession in passionate\r\nwords that would stir the whole being of that man to its innermost\r\ndepths; that would end in embraces and tears; in an incredible\r\nfellowship of souls--such as the world had never seen. It was sublime!\r\n\r\nInwardly he wept and trembled already. But to the casual eyes that were\r\ncast upon him he was aware that he appeared as a tranquil student in\r\na cloak, out for a leisurely stroll. He noted, too, the sidelong,\r\nbrilliant glance of a pretty woman--with a delicate head, and covered\r\nin the hairy skins of wild beasts down to her feet, like a frail and\r\nbeautiful savage--which rested for a moment with a sort of mocking\r\ntenderness on the deep abstraction of that good-looking young man.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Razumov stood still. The glimpse of a passing grey whisker,\r\ncaught and lost in the same instant, had evoked the complete image of\r\nPrince K---, the man who once had pressed his hand as no other man had\r\npressed it--a faint but lingering pressure like a secret sign, like a\r\nhalf-unwilling caress.\r\n\r\nAnd Razumov marvelled at himself. Why did he not think of him before!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA senator, a dignitary, a great personage, the very man--He!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA strange softening emotion came over Razumov--made his knees shake a\r\nlittle. He repressed it with a new-born austerity. All that sentiment\r\nwas pernicious nonsense. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be quick enough; and when he got\r\ninto a sledge he shouted to the driver--\xe2\x80\x9cto the K--- Palace. Get\r\non--you! Fly!\xe2\x80\x9d The startled moujik, bearded up to the very whites of\r\nhis eyes, answered obsequiously--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear, your high Nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was lucky for Razumov that Prince K--- was not a man of timid\r\ncharacter. On the day of Mr. de P---\xe2\x80\x98s murder an extreme alarm and\r\ndespondency prevailed in the high official spheres.\r\n\r\nPrince K---, sitting sadly alone in his study, was told by his alarmed\r\nservants that a mysterious young man had forced his way into the hall,\r\nrefused to tell his name and the nature of his business, and would not\r\nmove from there till he had seen his Excellency in private. Instead of\r\nlocking himself up and telephoning for the police, as nine out of ten\r\nhigh personages would have done that evening, the Prince gave way to\r\ncuriosity and came quietly to the door of his study.\r\n\r\nIn the hall, the front door standing wide open, he recognised at once\r\nRazumov, pale as death, his eyes blazing, and surrounded by perplexed\r\nlackeys.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was vexed beyond measure, and even indignant. But his humane\r\ninstincts and a subtle sense of self-respect could not allow him to\r\nlet this young man be thrown out into the street by base menials.\r\nHe retreated unseen into his room, and after a little rang his bell.\r\nRazumov heard in the hall an ominously raised harsh voice saying\r\nsomewhere far away--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow the gentleman in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov walked in without a tremor. He felt himself invulnerable--raised\r\nfar above the shallowness of common judgment. Though he saw the Prince\r\nlooking at him with black displeasure, the lucidity of his mind, of\r\nwhich he was very conscious, gave him an extraordinary assurance. He was\r\nnot asked to sit down.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later they appeared in the hall together. The lackeys stood\r\nup, and the Prince, moving with difficulty on his gouty feet, was helped\r\ninto his furs. The carriage had been ordered before. When the great\r\ndouble door was flung open with a crash, Razumov, who had been standing\r\nsilent with a lost gaze but with every faculty intensely on the alert,\r\nheard the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour arm, young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mobile, superficial mind of the ex-Guards officer, man of showy\r\nmissions, experienced in nothing but the arts of gallant intrigue\r\nand worldly success, had been equally impressed by the more obvious\r\ndifficulties of such a situation and by Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s quiet dignity in\r\nstating them.\r\n\r\nHe had said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Upon the whole I can\xe2\x80\x99t condemn the step you ventured\r\nto take by coming to me with your story. It is not an affair for police\r\nunderstrappers. The greatest importance is attached to.... Set\r\nyour mind at rest. I shall see you through this most extraordinary and\r\ndifficult situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the Prince rose to ring the bell, and Razumov, making a short bow,\r\nhad said with deference--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have trusted my instinct. A young man having no claim upon anybody\r\nin the world has in an hour of trial involving his deepest political\r\nconvictions turned to an illustrious Russian--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince had exclaimed hastily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the carriage--it was a small brougham on sleigh runners--Razumov\r\nbroke the silence in a voice that trembled slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gratitude surpasses the greatness of my presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gasped, feeling unexpectedly in the dark a momentary pressure on his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done well,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Prince.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage stopped the Prince murmured to Razumov, who had never\r\nventured a single question--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house of General T---.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the snow-covered roadway blazed a great bonfire.\r\nSome Cossacks, the bridles of their horses over the arm, were warming\r\nthemselves around. Two sentries stood at the door, several gendarmes\r\nlounged under the great carriage gateway, and on the first-floor\r\nlanding two orderlies rose and stood at attention. Razumov walked at the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s elbow.\r\n\r\nA surprising quantity of hot-house plants in pots cumbered the floor of\r\nthe ante-room. Servants came forward. A young man in civilian clothes\r\narrived hurriedly, was whispered to, bowed low, and exclaiming\r\nzealously, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly--this minute,\xe2\x80\x9d fled within somewhere. The Prince\r\nsigned to Razumov.\r\n\r\nThey passed through a suite of reception-rooms all barely lit and one\r\nof them prepared for dancing. The wife of the General had put off\r\nher party. An atmosphere of consternation pervaded the place. But the\r\nGeneral\xe2\x80\x99s own room, with heavy sombre hangings, two massive desks, and\r\ndeep armchairs, had all the lights turned on. The footman shut the door\r\nbehind them and they waited.\r\n\r\nThere was a coal fire in an English grate; Razumov had never before seen\r\nsuch a fire; and the silence of the room was like the silence of the\r\ngrave; perfect, measureless, for even the clock on the mantelpiece\r\nmade no sound. Filling a corner, on a black pedestal, stood a\r\nquarter-life-size smooth-limbed bronze of an adolescent figure, running.\r\nThe Prince observed in an undertone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpontini\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x98Flight of Youth.\xe2\x80\x99 Exquisite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Razumov faintly.\r\n\r\nThey said nothing more after this, the Prince silent with his grand air,\r\nRazumov staring at the statue. He was worried by a sensation resembling\r\nthe gnawing of hunger.\r\n\r\nHe did not turn when he heard an inner door fly open, and a quick\r\nfootstep, muffled on the carpet.\r\n\r\nThe Prince\xe2\x80\x99s voice immediately exclaimed, thick with excitement--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got him--_ce miserable_. A worthy young man came to me--No!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s incredible....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov held his breath before the bronze as if expecting a crash.\r\nBehind his back a voice he had never heard before insisted politely--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Asseyez-vous donc_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince almost shrieked, \xe2\x80\x9c_Mais comprenez-vous, mon cher!\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99assassin_! the murderer--we have got him....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov spun round. The General\xe2\x80\x99s smooth big cheeks rested on the stiff\r\ncollar of his uniform. He must have been already looking at Razumov,\r\nbecause that last saw the pale blue eyes fastened on him coldly.\r\n\r\nThe Prince from a chair waved an impressive hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a most honourable young man whom Providence itself... Mr.\r\nRazumov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General acknowledged the introduction by frowning at Razumov, who\r\ndid not make the slightest movement.\r\n\r\nSitting down before his desk the General listened with compressed lips.\r\nIt was impossible to detect any sign of emotion on his face.\r\n\r\nRazumov watched the immobility of the fleshy profile. But it lasted only\r\na moment, till the Prince had finished; and when the General turned to\r\nthe providential young man, his florid complexion, the blue, unbelieving\r\neyes and the bright white flash of an automatic smile had an air of\r\njovial, careless cruelty. He expressed no wonder at the extraordinary\r\nstory--no pleasure or excitement--no incredulity either. He betrayed no\r\nsentiment whatever. Only with a politeness almost deferential suggested\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cthe bird might have flown while Mr.--Mr. Razumov was running about\r\nthe streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov advanced to the middle of the room and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe door is locked\r\nand I have the key in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis loathing for the man was intense. It had come upon him so unawares\r\nthat he felt he had not kept it out of his voice. The General looked up\r\nat him thoughtfully, and Razumov grinned.\r\n\r\nAll this went over the head of Prince K--- seated in a deep armchair,\r\nvery tired and impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA student called Haldin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the General thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nRazumov ceased to grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is his name,\xe2\x80\x9d he said unnecessarily loud. \xe2\x80\x9cVictor Victorovitch\r\nHaldin--a student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General shifted his position a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he dressed? Would you have the goodness to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov angrily described Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s clothing in a few jerky words. The\r\nGeneral stared all the time, then addressing the Prince--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were not without some indications,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in French. \xe2\x80\x9cA good woman\r\nwho was in the street described to us somebody wearing a dress of the\r\nsort as the thrower of the second bomb. We have detained her at the\r\nSecretariat, and every one in a Tcherkess coat we could lay our hands\r\non has been brought to her to look at. She kept on crossing herself\r\nand shaking her head at them. It was exasperating....\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to\r\nRazumov, and in Russian, with friendly reproach--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a chair, Mr. Razumov--do. Why are you standing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov sat down carelessly and looked at the General.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis goggle-eyed imbecile understands nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nThe Prince began to speak loftily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Razumov is a young man of conspicuous abilities. I have it at heart\r\nthat his future should not....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the General, with a movement of the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHas\r\nhe any weapons on him, do you think, Mr. Razumov?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General employed a gentle musical voice. Razumov answered with\r\nsuppressed irritation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But my razors are lying about--you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General lowered his head approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen to the Prince, explaining courteously--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want that bird alive. It will be the devil if we can\xe2\x80\x99t make him sing\r\na little before we are done with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grave-like silence of the room with its mute clock fell upon the\r\npolite modulations of this terrible phrase. The Prince, hidden in the\r\nchair, made no sound.\r\n\r\nThe General unexpectedly developed a thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFidelity to menaced institutions on which depend the safety of a\r\nthrone and of a people is no child\xe2\x80\x99s play. We know that, _mon Prince,_\r\nand--_tenez_--\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a sort of flattering harshness, \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nRazumov here begins to understand that too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes which he turned upon Razumov seemed to be starting out of his\r\nhead. This grotesqueness of aspect no longer shocked Razumov. He said\r\nwith gloomy conviction--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaldin will never speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat remains to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the General.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cA man like this never speaks....\r\nDo you imagine that I am here from fear?\xe2\x80\x9d he added violently. He felt\r\nready to stand by his opinion of Haldin to the last extremity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d protested the General, with great simplicity of tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you, Mr. Razumov, that if he had not come\r\nwith his tale to such a staunch and loyal Russian as you, he would\r\nhave disappeared like a stone in the water... which would have had a\r\ndetestable effect,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a bright, cruel smile under his stony\r\nstare. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you see, there can be no suspicion of any fear here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince intervened, looking at Razumov round the back of the\r\narmchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody doubts the moral soundness of your action. Be at ease in that\r\nrespect, pray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to the General uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I am here. You may be surprised why I should....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General hastened to interrupt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Extremely natural. You saw the importance....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in the Prince. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I venture to ask insistently that mine\r\nand Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s intervention should not become public. He is a young\r\nman of promise--of remarkable aptitudes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the General. \xe2\x80\x9cHe inspires\r\nconfidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll sorts of pernicious views are so widespread nowadays--they taint\r\nsuch unexpected quarters--that, monstrous as it seems, he might suffer\r\n...his studies...his...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General, with his elbows on the desk, took his head between his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Yes. I am thinking it out.... How long is it since you left him\r\nat your rooms, Mr. Razumov?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov mentioned the hour which nearly corresponded with the time of\r\nhis distracted flight from the big slum house. He had made up his mind\r\nto keep Ziemianitch out of the affair completely. To mention him at all\r\nwould mean imprisonment for the \xe2\x80\x9cbright soul,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps cruel floggings,\r\nand in the end a journey to Siberia in chains. Razumov, who had beaten\r\nZiemianitch, felt for him now a vague, remorseful tenderness.\r\n\r\nThe General, giving way for the first time to his secret sentiments,\r\nexclaimed contemptuously--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say he came in to make you this confidence like this--for\r\nnothing--_a propos des bottes_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov felt danger in the air. The merciless suspicion of despotism had\r\nspoken openly at last. Sudden fear sealed Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s lips. The silence\r\nof the room resembled now the silence of a deep dungeon, where time does\r\nnot count, and a suspect person is sometimes forgotten for ever. But the\r\nPrince came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvidence itself has led the wretch in a moment of mental aberration\r\nto seek Mr. Razumov on the strength of some old, utterly misinterpreted\r\nexchange of ideas--some sort of idle speculative conversation--months\r\nago--I am told--and completely forgotten till now by Mr. Razumov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d queried the General meditatively, after a short silence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo you often indulge in speculative conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Razumov, coolly, in a sudden access of\r\nself-confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a man of deep convictions. Crude opinions are\r\nin the air. They are not always worth combating. But even the silent\r\ncontempt of a serious mind may be misinterpreted by headlong utopists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General stared from between his hands. Prince K--- murmured--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA serious young man. _Un esprit superieur_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that, _mon cher Prince_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the General. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Razumov is quite\r\nsafe with me. I am interested in him. He has, it seems, the great and\r\nuseful quality of inspiring confidence. What I was wondering at is why\r\nthe other should mention anything at all--I mean even the bare fact\r\nalone--if his object was only to obtain temporary shelter for a few\r\nhours. For, after all, nothing was easier than to say nothing about it\r\nunless, indeed, he were trying, under a crazy misapprehension of your\r\ntrue sentiments, to enlist your assistance--eh, Mr. Razumov?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Razumov that the floor was moving slightly. This grotesque\r\nman in a tight uniform was terrible. It was right that he should be\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see what your Excellency has in your mind. But I can only answer\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing in my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the General, with gentle surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am his prey--his helpless prey,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov. The fatigues and\r\nthe disgusts of that afternoon, the need to forget, the fear which he\r\ncould not keep off, reawakened his hate for Haldin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I can\xe2\x80\x99t help your Excellency. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he meant. I only\r\nknow there was a moment when I wished to kill him. There was also a\r\nmoment when I wished myself dead. I said nothing. I was overcome. I\r\nprovoked no confidence--I asked for no explanations--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov seemed beside himself; but his mind was lucid. It was really a\r\ncalculated outburst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rather a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d the General said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you did not. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow at all what he means to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov calmed down and saw an opening\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me he was in hopes that a sledge would meet him about half an\r\nhour after midnight at the seventh lamp-post on the left from the upper\r\nend of Karabelnaya. At any rate, he meant to be there at that time. He\r\ndid not even ask me for a change of clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ah voila_!\xe2\x80\x9d said the General, turning to Prince K with an air of\r\nsatisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a way to keep your _protege_, Mr. Razumov, quite\r\nclear of any connexion with the actual arrest. We shall be ready for\r\nthat gentleman in Karabelnaya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince expressed his gratitude. There was real emotion in his voice.\r\nRazumov, motionless, silent, sat staring at the carpet. The General\r\nturned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour after midnight. Till then we have to depend on you, Mr.\r\nRazumov. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is likely to change his purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cThose men are not of the sort that ever\r\nchanges its purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat men do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanatical lovers of liberty in general. Liberty with a capital L,\r\nExcellency. Liberty that means nothing precise. Liberty in whose name\r\ncrimes are committed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General murmured--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI detest rebels of every kind. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. It\xe2\x80\x99s my nature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clenched a fist and shook it, drawing back his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThey shall be\r\ndestroyed, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have made a sacrifice of their lives beforehand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov\r\nwith malicious pleasure and looking the General straight in the face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Haldin does change his purpose to-night, you may depend on it that\r\nit will not be to save his life by flight in some other way. He would\r\nhave thought then of something else to attempt. But that is not likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General repeated as if to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThey shall be destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov assumed an impenetrable expression.\r\n\r\nThe Prince exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a terrible necessity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General\xe2\x80\x99s arm was lowered slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne comfort there is. That brood leaves no posterity. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said\r\nit, one effort, pitiless, persistent, steady--and we are done with them\r\nfor ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov thought to himself that this man entrusted with so much\r\narbitrary power must have believed what he said or else he could not\r\nhave gone on bearing the responsibility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI detest rebels. These subversive minds! These intellectual\r\n_debauches_! My existence has been built on fidelity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling.\r\nTo defend it I am ready to lay down my life--and even my honour--if\r\nthat were needed. But pray tell me what honour can there be as against\r\nrebels--against people that deny God Himself--perfect unbelievers!\r\nBrutes. It is horrible to think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this tirade Razumov, facing the General, had nodded slightly\r\ntwice. Prince K---, standing on one side with his grand air, murmured,\r\ncasting up his eyes--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Helas!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen lowering his glance and with great decision declared--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis young man, General, is perfectly fit to apprehend the bearing of\r\nyour memorable words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe General\xe2\x80\x99s whole expression changed from dull resentment to perfect\r\nurbanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would ask now, Mr. Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto return to his home. Note\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask Mr. Razumov whether he has justified his absence to his\r\nguest. No doubt he did this sufficiently. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask. Mr. Razumov\r\ninspires confidence. It is a great gift. I only suggest that a more\r\nprolonged absence might awaken the criminal\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions and induce him\r\nperhaps to change his plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose and with a scrupulous courtesy escorted his visitors to the\r\nante-room encumbered with flower-pots.\r\n\r\nRazumov parted with the Prince at the corner of a street. In the\r\ncarriage he had listened to speeches where natural sentiment struggled\r\nwith caution. Evidently the Prince was afraid of encouraging any hopes\r\nof future intercourse. But there was a touch of tenderness in the voice\r\nuttering in the dark the guarded general phrases of goodwill. And the\r\nPrince too said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have perfect confidence in you, Mr. Razumov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey all, it seems, have confidence in me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov dully. He\r\nhad an indulgent contempt for the man sitting shoulder to shoulder with\r\nhim in the confined space. Probably he was afraid of scenes with his\r\nwife. She was said to be proud and violent.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him bizarre that secrecy should play such a large part in\r\nthe comfort and safety of lives. But he wanted to put the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind at ease; and with a proper amount of emphasis he said that, being\r\nconscious of some small abilities and confident in his power of work, he\r\ntrusted his future to his own exertions. He expressed his gratitude for\r\nthe helping hand. Such dangerous situations did not occur twice in the\r\ncourse of one life--he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have met this one with a firmness of mind and correctness\r\nof feeling which give me a high idea of your worth,\xe2\x80\x9d the Prince said\r\nsolemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have now only to persevere--to persevere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn getting out on the pavement Razumov saw an ungloved hand extended to\r\nhim through the lowered window of the brougham. It detained his own in\r\nits grasp for a moment, while the light of a street lamp fell upon the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s long face and old-fashioned grey whiskers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are perfectly reassured now as to the consequences...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what your Excellency has condescended to do for me, I can only\r\nrely on my conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Adieu_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the whiskered head with feeling.\r\n\r\nRazumov bowed. The brougham glided away with a slight swish in the\r\nsnow--he was alone on the edge of the pavement.\r\n\r\nHe said to himself that there was nothing to think about, and began\r\nwalking towards his home.\r\n\r\nHe walked quietly. It was a common experience to walk thus home to bed\r\nafter an evening spent somewhere with his fellows or in the cheaper\r\nseats of a theatre. After he had gone a little way the familiarity of\r\nthings got hold of him. Nothing was changed. There was the familiar\r\ncorner; and when he turned it he saw the familiar dim light of the\r\nprovision shop kept by a German woman. There were loaves of stale bread,\r\nbunches of onions and strings of sausages behind the small window-panes.\r\nThey were closing it. The sickly lame fellow whom he knew so well by\r\nsight staggered out into the snow embracing a large shutter.\r\n\r\nNothing would change. There was the familiar gateway yawning black with\r\nfeeble glimmers marking the arches of the different staircases.\r\n\r\nThe sense of life\xe2\x80\x99s continuity depended on trifling bodily impressions.\r\nThe trivialities of daily existence were an armour for the soul. And\r\nthis thought reinforced the inward quietness of Razumov as he began to\r\nclimb the stairs familiar to his feet in the dark, with his hand on the\r\nfamiliar clammy banister. The exceptional could not prevail against the\r\nmaterial contacts which make one day resemble another. To-morrow would\r\nbe like yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt was only on the stage that the unusual was outwardly acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if I had made up my mind to blow out\r\nmy brains on the landing I would be going up these stairs as quietly\r\nas I am doing it now. What\xe2\x80\x99s a man to do? What must be must be.\r\nExtraordinary things do happen. But when they have happened they are\r\ndone with. Thus, too, when the mind is made up. That question is done\r\nwith. And the daily concerns, the familiarities of our thought swallow\r\nit up--and the life goes on as before with its mysterious and secret\r\nsides quite out of sight, as they should be. Life is a public thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov unlocked his door and took the key out; entered very quietly and\r\nbolted the door behind him carefully.\r\n\r\nHe thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHe hears me,\xe2\x80\x9d and after bolting the door he stood still\r\nholding his breath. There was not a sound. He crossed the bare outer\r\nroom, stepping deliberately in the darkness. Entering the other, he felt\r\nall over his table for the matchbox. The silence, but for the groping of\r\nhis hand, was profound. Could the fellow be sleeping so soundly?\r\n\r\nHe struck a light and looked at the bed. Haldin was lying on his back as\r\nbefore, only both his hands were under his head. His eyes were open. He\r\nstared at the ceiling.\r\n\r\nRazumov held the match up. He saw the clear-cut features, the firm\r\nchin, the white forehead and the topknot of fair hair against the white\r\npillow. There he was, lying flat on his back. Razumov thought suddenly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have walked over his chest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to stare till the match burnt itself out; then struck\r\nanother and lit the lamp in silence without looking towards the bed any\r\nmore. He had turned his back on it and was hanging his coat on a peg\r\nwhen he heard Haldin sigh profoundly, then ask in a tired voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! And what have you arranged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe emotion was so great that Razumov was glad to put his hands against\r\nthe wall. A diabolical impulse to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI have given you up to the\r\npolice,\xe2\x80\x9d frightened him exceedingly. But he did not say that. He said,\r\nwithout turning round, in a muffled voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he heard Haldin sigh. He walked to the table, sat down with the\r\nlamp before him, and only then looked towards the bed.\r\n\r\nIn the distant corner of the large room far away from the lamp, which\r\nwas small and provided with a very thick china shade, Haldin appeared\r\nlike a dark and elongated shape--rigid with the immobility of death.\r\nThis body seemed to have less substance than its own phantom walked over\r\nby Razumov in the street white with snow. It was more alarming in its\r\nshadowy, persistent reality than the distinct but vanishing illusion.\r\n\r\nHaldin was heard again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have had a walk--such a walk,...\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured\r\ndeprecatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis weather....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov answered with energy--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible walk.... A nightmare of a walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shuddered audibly. Haldin sighed once more, then--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you have seen Ziemianitch--brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, remembering the time he had spent with the Prince, thought it\r\nprudent to add, \xe2\x80\x9cI had to wait some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA character--eh? It\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary what a sense of the necessity of\r\nfreedom there is in that man. And he has sayings too--simple, to the\r\npoint, such as only the people can invent in their rough sagacity. A\r\ncharacter that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, you understand, haven\xe2\x80\x99t had much opportunity....\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov\r\nmuttered through his teeth.\r\n\r\nHaldin continued to stare at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, brother, I have been a good deal in that house of late. I used\r\nto take there books--leaflets. Not a few of the poor people who live\r\nthere can read. And, you see, the guests for the feast of freedom must\r\nbe sought for in byways and hedges. The truth is, I have almost lived in\r\nthat house of late. I slept sometimes in the stable. There is a\r\nstable....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where I had my interview with Ziemianitch,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nRazumov gently. A mocking spirit entered into him and he added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nsatisfactory in a sense. I came away from it much relieved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! he\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Haldin, talking slowly at the ceiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncame to know him in that way, you see. For some weeks now, ever since I\r\nresigned myself to do what had to be done, I tried to isolate myself. I\r\ngave up my rooms. What was the good of exposing a decent widow woman\r\nto the risk of being worried out of her mind by the police? I gave up\r\nseeing any of our comrades....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov drew to himself a half-sheet of paper and began to trace lines\r\non it with a pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought angrily, \xe2\x80\x9che seems to have thought of\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s safety but mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaldin was talking on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning--ah! this morning--that was different. How can I explain\r\nto you? Before the deed was done I wandered at night and lay hid in the\r\nday, thinking it out, and I felt restful. Sleepless but restful. What\r\nwas there for me to torment myself about? But this morning--after! Then\r\nit was that I became restless. I could not have stopped in that big\r\nhouse full of misery. The miserable of this world can\xe2\x80\x99t give you peace.\r\nThen when that silly caretaker began to shout, I said to myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is a young man in this town head and shoulders above common\r\nprejudices.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he laughing at me?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov asked himself, going on with his\r\naimless drawing of triangles and squares. And suddenly he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nbehaviour must appear to him strange. Should he take fright at my manner\r\nand rush off somewhere I shall be undone completely. That infernal\r\nGeneral....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped the pencil and turned abruptly towards the bed with the\r\nshadowy figure extended full length on it--so much more indistinct than\r\nthe one over whose breast he had walked without faltering. Was this,\r\ntoo, a phantom?\r\n\r\nThe silence had lasted a long time. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is no longer here,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nthought against which Razumov struggled desperately, quite frightened at\r\nits absurdity. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is already gone and this...only...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could resist no longer. He sprang to his feet, saying aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nintolerably anxious,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a few headlong strides stood by the side\r\nof the bed. His hand fell lightly on Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and directly\r\nhe felt its reality he was beset by an insane temptation to grip that\r\nexposed throat and squeeze the breath out of that body, lest it should\r\nescape his custody, leaving only a phantom behind.\r\n\r\nHaldin did not stir a limb, but his overshadowed eyes moving a little\r\ngazed upwards at Razumov with wistful gratitude for this manifestation\r\nof feeling.\r\n\r\nRazumov turned away and strode up and down the room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been\r\npossibly a kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself, and was appalled by the\r\nnature of that apology for a murderous intention his mind had found\r\nsomewhere within him. And all the same he could not give it up. He\r\nbecame lucid about it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he expect?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe halter--in\r\nthe end. And I....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis argument was interrupted by Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy be anxious for me? They can kill my body, but they cannot exile my\r\nsoul from this world. I tell you what--I believe in this world so much\r\nthat I cannot conceive eternity otherwise than as a very long life. That\r\nis perhaps the reason I am so ready to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumov, and biting his lower lip he continued to walk\r\nup and down and to carry on his strange argument.\r\n\r\nYes, to a man in such a situation--of course it would be an act of\r\nkindness. The question, however, was not how to be kind, but how to be\r\nfirm. He was a slippery customer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI too, Victor Victorovitch, believe in this world of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nwith force. \xe2\x80\x9cI too, while I live.... But you seem determined to haunt\r\nit. You can\xe2\x80\x99t seriously...mean...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice of the motionless Haldin began--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaunt it! Truly, the oppressors of thought which quickens the world,\r\nthe destroyers of souls which aspire to perfection of human dignity,\r\nthey shall be haunted. As to the destroyers of my mere body, I have\r\nforgiven them beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had stopped apparently to listen, but at the same time he was\r\nobserving his own sensations. He was vexed with himself for attaching so\r\nmuch importance to what Haldin said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fellow\xe2\x80\x99s mad,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought firmly, but this opinion did not mollify\r\nhim towards Haldin. It was a particularly impudent form of lunacy--and\r\nwhen it got loose in the sphere of public life of a country, it was\r\nobviously the duty of every good citizen....\r\n\r\nThis train of thought broke off short there and was succeeded by a\r\nparoxysm of silent hatred towards Haldin, so intense that Razumov\r\nhastened to speak at random.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Eternity, of course. I, too, can\xe2\x80\x99t very well represent it to\r\nmyself.... I imagine it, however, as something quiet and dull. There\r\nwould be nothing unexpected--don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? The element of time would be\r\nwanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled out his watch and gazed at it. Haldin turned over on his side\r\nand looked on intently.\r\n\r\nRazumov got frightened at this movement. A slippery customer this fellow\r\nwith a phantom. It was not midnight yet. He hastened on--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd unfathomable mysteries! Can you conceive secret places in Eternity?\r\nImpossible. Whereas life is full of them. There are secrets of birth,\r\nfor instance. One carries them on to the grave. There is something\r\ncomical...but never mind. And there are secret motives of conduct. A\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s most open actions have a secret side to them. That is interesting\r\nand so unfathomable! For instance, a man goes out of a room for a walk.\r\nNothing more trivial in appearance. And yet it may be momentous. He\r\ncomes back--he has seen perhaps a drunken brute, taken particular notice\r\nof the snow on the ground--and behold he is no longer the same man. The\r\nmost unlikely things have a secret power over one\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts--the grey\r\nwhiskers of a particular person--the goggle eyes of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s forehead was moist. He took a turn or two in the room, his\r\nhead low and smiling to himself viciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever reflected on the power of goggle eyes and grey whiskers?\r\nExcuse me. You seem to think I must be crazy to talk in this vein at\r\nsuch a time. But I am not talking lightly. I have seen instances. It has\r\nhappened to me once to be talking to a man whose fate was affected by\r\nphysical facts of that kind. And the man did not know it. Of course, it\r\nwas a case of conscience, but the material facts such as these brought\r\nabout the solution.... And you tell me, Victor Victorovitch, not to\r\nbe anxious! Why! I am responsible for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov almost shrieked.\r\n\r\nHe avoided with difficulty a burst of Mephistophelian laughter. Haldin,\r\nvery pale, raised himself on his elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the surprises of life,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Razumov, after glancing at the\r\nother uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cJust consider their astonishing nature. A mysterious\r\nimpulse induces you to come here. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say you have done wrong.\r\nIndeed, from a certain point of view you could not have done better. You\r\nmight have gone to a man with affections and family ties. You have\r\nsuch ties yourself. As to me, you know I have been brought up in an\r\neducational institute where they did not give us enough to eat. To talk\r\nof affection in such a connexion--you perceive yourself.... As\r\nto ties, the only ties I have in the world are social. I must get\r\nacknowledged in some way before I can act at all. I sit here working....\r\nAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I am working for progress too? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find\r\nmy own ideas of the true way.... Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Razumov, after\r\ndrawing breath and with a short, throaty laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t inherited\r\na revolutionary inspiration together with a resemblance from an uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked again at his watch and noticed with sickening disgust that\r\nthere were yet a good many minutes to midnight. He tore watch and chain\r\noff his waistcoat and laid them on the table well in the circle of\r\nbright lamplight. Haldin, reclining on his elbow, did not stir. Razumov\r\nwas made uneasy by this attitude. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat move is he meditating over so\r\nquietly?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be prevented. I must keep on talking to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a son, a brother, a nephew, a cousin--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what--to no\r\nend of people. I am just a man. Here I stand before you. A man with a\r\nmind. Did it ever occur to you how a man who had never heard a word of\r\nwarm affection or praise in his life would think on matters on which\r\nyou would think first with or against your class, your domestic\r\ntradition--your fireside prejudices?... Did you ever consider how a\r\nman like that would feel? I have no domestic tradition. I have nothing\r\nto think against. My tradition is historical. What have I to look back\r\nto but that national past from which you gentlemen want to wrench away\r\nyour future? Am I to let my intelligence, my aspirations towards a\r\nbetter lot, be robbed of the only thing it has to go upon at the will of\r\nviolent enthusiasts? You come from your province, but all this land is\r\nmine--or I have nothing. No doubt you shall be looked upon as a martyr\r\nsome day--a sort of hero--a political saint. But I beg to be excused. I\r\nam content in fitting myself to be a worker. And what can you people do\r\nby scattering a few drops of blood on the snow? On this Immensity. On\r\nthis unhappy Immensity! I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, in a vibrating, subdued\r\nvoice, and advancing one step nearer the bed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what it needs is not\r\na lot of haunting phantoms that I could walk through--but a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaldin threw his arms forward as if to keep him off in horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand it all now,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with awestruck dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand--at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov staggered back against the table. His forehead broke out in\r\nperspiration while a cold shudder ran down his spine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I been saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I let him slip\r\nthrough my fingers after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe felt his lips go stiff like buckram, and instead of a reassuring\r\nsmile only achieved an uncertain grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have?\xe2\x80\x9d he began in a conciliating voice which got steady\r\nafter the first trembling word or two. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have? Consider--a\r\nman of studious, retired habits--and suddenly like this.... I am not\r\npractised in talking delicately. But...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt anger, a wicked anger, get hold of him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were we to do together till midnight? Sit here opposite each other\r\nand think of your--your--shambles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaldin had a subdued, heartbroken attitude. He bowed his head; his hands\r\nhung between his knees. His voice was low and pained but calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see now how it is, Razumov--brother. You are a magnanimous soul, but\r\nmy action is abhorrent to you--alas....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov stared. From fright he had set his teeth so hard that his whole\r\nface ached. It was impossible for him to make a sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even my person, too, is loathsome to you perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d Haldin added\r\nmournfully, after a short pause, looking up for a moment, then fixing\r\nhis gaze on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cFor indeed, unless one....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off evidently waiting for a word. Razumov remained silent.\r\nHaldin nodded his head dejectedly twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. Of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.... \xe2\x80\x9cAh! weary work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained perfectly still for a moment, then made Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s leaden\r\nheart strike a ponderous blow by springing up briskly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried sadly in a low, distinct tone. \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov started forward, but the sight of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s raised hand checked\r\nhim before he could get away from the table. He leaned on it heavily,\r\nlistening to the faint sounds of some town clock tolling the hour.\r\nHaldin, already at the door, tall and straight as an arrow, with his\r\npale face and a hand raised attentively, might have posed for the statue\r\nof a daring youth listening to an inner voice. Razumov mechanically\r\nglanced down at his watch. When he looked towards the door again Haldin\r\nhad vanished. There was a faint rustling in the outer room, the feeble\r\nclick of a bolt drawn back lightly. He was gone--almost as noiseless as\r\na vision.\r\n\r\nRazumov ran forward unsteadily, with parted, voiceless lips. The outer\r\ndoor stood open. Staggering out on the landing, he leaned far over the\r\nbanister. Gazing down into the deep black shaft with a tiny glimmering\r\nflame at the bottom, he traced by ear the rapid spiral descent of\r\nsomebody running down the stairs on tiptoe. It was a light, swift,\r\npattering sound, which sank away from him into the depths: a fleeting\r\nshadow passed over the glimmer--a wink of the tiny flame. Then\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\nRazumov hung over, breathing the cold raw air tainted by the evil smells\r\nof the unclean staircase. All quiet.\r\n\r\nHe went back into his room slowly, shutting the doors after him. The\r\npeaceful steady light of his reading-lamp shone on the watch. Razumov\r\nstood looking down at the little white dial. It wanted yet three minutes\r\nto midnight. He took the watch into his hand fumblingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlow,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, and a strange fit of nervelessness came over him.\r\nHis knees shook, the watch and chain slipped through his fingers in an\r\ninstant and fell on the floor. He was so startled that he nearly fell\r\nhimself. When at last he regained enough confidence in his limbs to\r\nstoop for it he held it to his ear at once. After a while he growled--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStopped,\xe2\x80\x9d and paused for quite a long time before he muttered sourly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done.... And now to work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down, reached haphazard for a book, opened it in middle and began\r\nto read; but after going conscientiously over two lines he lost his hold\r\non the print completely and did not try to regain it. He thought--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was to a certainty a police agent of some sort watching the house\r\nacross the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe imagined him lurking in a dark gateway, goggle-eyed, muffled up in a\r\ncloak to the nose and with a General\xe2\x80\x99s plumed, cocked hat on his head.\r\nThis absurdity made him start in the chair convulsively. He literally\r\nhad to shake his head violently to get rid of it. The man would be\r\ndisguised perhaps as a peasant... a beggar.... Perhaps he would\r\nbe just buttoned up in a dark overcoat and carrying a loaded stick--a\r\nshifty-eyed rascal, smelling of raw onions and spirits.\r\n\r\nThis evocation brought on positive nausea. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I want to bother\r\nabout this?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov with disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I a gendarme? Moreover,\r\nit is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up in great agitation. It was not done. Not yet. Not till\r\nhalf-past twelve. And the watch had stopped. This reduced him to\r\ndespair. Impossible to know the time! The landlady and all the people\r\nacross the landing were asleep. How could he go and... God knows\r\nwhat they would imagine, or how much they would guess. He dared not\r\ngo into the streets to find out. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a suspect now. There\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nshirking that fact,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself bitterly. If Haldin from\r\nsome cause or another gave them the slip and failed to turn up in the\r\nKarabelnaya the police would be invading his lodging. And if he were not\r\nin he could never clear himself. Never. Razumov looked wildly about as\r\nif for some means of seizing upon time which seemed to have escaped\r\nhim altogether. He had never, as far as he could remember, heard the\r\nstriking of that town clock in his rooms before this night. And he was\r\nnot even sure now whether he had heard it really on this night.\r\n\r\nHe went to the window and stood there with slightly bent head on the\r\nwatch for the faint sound. \xe2\x80\x9cI will stay here till I hear something,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said to himself. He stood still, his ear turned to the panes. An\r\natrocious aching numbness with shooting pains in his back and legs\r\ntortured him. He did not budge. His mind hovered on the borders of\r\ndelirium. He heard himself suddenly saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI confess,\xe2\x80\x9d as a person\r\nmight do on the rack. \xe2\x80\x9cI am on the rack,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He felt ready to\r\nswoon. The faint deep boom of the distant clock seemed to explode in his\r\nhead--he heard it so clearly.... One!\r\n\r\nIf Haldin had not turned up the police would have been already here\r\nransacking the house. No sound reached him. This time it was done.\r\n\r\nHe dragged himself painfully to the table and dropped into the chair.\r\nHe flung the book away and took a square sheet of paper. It was like the\r\npile of sheets covered with his neat minute handwriting, only blank. He\r\ntook a pen brusquely and dipped it with a vague notion of going on with\r\nthe writing of his essay--but his pen remained poised over the sheet.\r\nIt hung there for some time before it came down and formed long scrawly\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nStill-faced and his lips set hard, Razumov began to write. When he wrote\r\na large hand his neat writing lost its character altogether--became\r\nunsteady, almost childish. He wrote five lines one under the other.\r\nHistory not Theory. Patriotism not Internationalism. Evolution not\r\nRevolution. Direction not Destruction. Unity not Disruption.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at them dully. Then his eyes strayed to the bed and remained\r\nfixed there for a good many minutes, while his right hand groped all\r\nover the table for the penknife.\r\n\r\nHe rose at last, and walking up with measured steps stabbed the paper\r\nwith the penknife to the lath and plaster wall at the head of the bed.\r\nThis done he stepped back a pace and flourished his hand with a glance\r\nround the room.\r\n\r\nAfter that he never looked again at the bed. He took his big cloak down\r\nfrom its peg and, wrapping himself up closely, went to lie down on\r\nthe hard horse-hair sofa at the other side of his room. A leaden\r\nsleep closed his eyelids at once. Several times that night he woke up\r\nshivering from a dream of walking through drifts of snow in a Russia\r\nwhere he was as completely alone as any betrayed autocrat could be; an\r\nimmense, wintry Russia which, somehow, his view could embrace in all its\r\nenormous expanse as if it were a map. But after each shuddering start\r\nhis heavy eyelids fell over his glazed eyes and he slept again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nApproaching this part of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s story, my mind, the decent mind\r\nof an old teacher of languages, feels more and more the difficulty of\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\nThe task is not in truth the writing in the narrative form a _precis_\r\nof a strange human document, but the rendering--I perceive it now\r\nclearly--of the moral conditions ruling over a large portion of this\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x99s surface; conditions not easily to be understood, much less\r\ndiscovered in the limits of a story, till some key-word is found; a word\r\nthat could stand at the back of all the words covering the pages; a word\r\nwhich, if not truth itself, may perchance hold truth enough to help the\r\nmoral discovery which should be the object of every tale.\r\n\r\nI turn over for the hundredth time the leaves of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s record, I\r\nlay it aside, I take up the pen--and the pen being ready for its office\r\nof setting down black on white I hesitate. For the word that persists in\r\ncreeping under its point is no other word than \xe2\x80\x9ccynicism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor that is the mark of Russian autocracy and of Russian revolt. In its\r\npride of numbers, in its strange pretensions of sanctity, and in the\r\nsecret readiness to abase itself in suffering, the spirit of Russia is\r\nthe spirit of cynicism. It informs the declarations of her statesmen,\r\nthe theories of her revolutionists, and the mystic vaticinations of\r\nprophets to the point of making freedom look like a form of debauch, and\r\nthe Christian virtues themselves appear actually indecent.... But I\r\nmust apologize for the digression. It proceeds from the consideration\r\nof the course taken by the story of Mr. Razumov after his conservative\r\nconvictions, diluted in a vague liberalism natural to the ardour of his\r\nage, had become crystallized by the shock of his contact with Haldin.\r\n\r\nRazumov woke up for the tenth time perhaps with a heavy shiver. Seeing\r\nthe light of day in his window, he resisted the inclination to lay\r\nhimself down again. He did not remember anything, but he did not think\r\nit strange to find himself on the sofa in his cloak and chilled to the\r\nbone. The light coming through the window seemed strangely cheerless,\r\ncontaining no promise as the light of each new day should for a young\r\nman. It was the awakening of a man mortally ill, or of a man ninety\r\nyears old. He looked at the lamp which had burnt itself out. It stood\r\nthere, the extinguished beacon of his labours, a cold object of brass\r\nand porcelain, amongst the scattered pages of his notes and small\r\npiles of books--a mere litter of blackened paper--dead matter--without\r\nsignificance or interest.\r\n\r\nHe got on his feet, and divesting himself of his cloak hung it on the\r\npeg, going through all the motions mechanically. An incredible dullness,\r\na ditch-water stagnation was sensible to his perceptions as though life\r\nhad withdrawn itself from all things and even from his own thoughts.\r\nThere was not a sound in the house.\r\n\r\nTurning away from the peg, he thought in that same lifeless manner that\r\nit must be very early yet; but when he looked at the watch on his table\r\nhe saw both hands arrested at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled to himself, and as if beginning to get roused\r\na little he took a survey of his room. The paper stabbed to the wall\r\narrested his attention. He eyed it from the distance without approval or\r\nperplexity; but when he heard the servant-girl beginning to bustle about\r\nin the outer room with the _samovar_ for his morning tea, he walked up\r\nto it and took it down with an air of profound indifference.\r\n\r\nWhile doing this he glanced down at the bed on which he had not slept\r\nthat night. The hollow in the pillow made by the weight of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nwas very noticeable.\r\n\r\nEven his anger at this sign of the man\xe2\x80\x99s passage was dull. He did not\r\ntry to nurse it into life. He did nothing all that day; he neglected\r\neven to brush his hair. The idea of going out never occurred to him--and\r\nif he did not start a connected train of thought it was not because he\r\nwas unable to think. It was because he was not interested enough.\r\n\r\nHe yawned frequently. He drank large quantities of tea, he walked about\r\naimlessly, and when he sat down he did not budge for a long time. He\r\nspent some time drumming on the window with his finger-tips quietly. In\r\nhis listless wanderings round about the table he caught sight of his own\r\nface in the looking-glass and that arrested him. The eyes which returned\r\nhis stare were the most unhappy eyes he had ever seen. And this was the\r\nfirst thing which disturbed the mental stagnation of that day.\r\n\r\nHe was not affected personally. He merely thought that life without\r\nhappiness is impossible. What was happiness? He yawned and went on\r\nshuffling about and about between the walls of his room. Looking\r\nforward was happiness--that\xe2\x80\x99s all--nothing more. To look forward to\r\nthe gratification of some desire, to the gratification of some passion,\r\nlove, ambition, hate--hate too indubitably. Love and hate. And to escape\r\nthe dangers of existence, to live without fear, was also happiness.\r\nThere was nothing else. Absence of fear--looking forward. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! the\r\nmiserable lot of humanity!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed mentally; and added at once in\r\nhis thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to be happy enough as far as that goes.\xe2\x80\x9d But he\r\nwas not excited by that assurance. On the contrary, he yawned again as\r\nhe had been yawning all day. He was mildly surprised to discover himself\r\nbeing overtaken by night. The room grew dark swiftly though time had\r\nseemed to stand still. How was it that he had not noticed the passing of\r\nthat day? Of course, it was the watch being stopped....\r\n\r\nHe did not light his lamp, but went over to the bed and threw himself on\r\nit without any hesitation. Lying on his back, he put his hands under his\r\nhead and stared upward. After a moment he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI am lying here like\r\nthat man. I wonder if he slept while I was struggling with the blizzard\r\nin the streets. No, he did not sleep. But why should I not sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhe felt the silence of the night press upon all his limbs like a weight.\r\n\r\nIn the calm of the hard frost outside, the clear-cut strokes of the town\r\nclock counting off midnight penetrated the quietness of his suspended\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\nAgain he began to think. It was twenty-four hours since that man left\r\nhis room. Razumov had a distinct feeling that Haldin in the fortress was\r\nsleeping that night. It was a certitude which made him angry because\r\nhe did not want to think of Haldin, but he justified it to himself by\r\nphysiological and psychological reasons. The fellow had hardly slept for\r\nweeks on his own confession, and now every incertitude was at an end\r\nfor him. No doubt he was looking forward to the consummation of his\r\nmartyrdom. A man who resigns himself to kill need not go very far for\r\nresignation to die. Haldin slept perhaps more soundly than General T---,\r\nwhose task--weary work too--was not done, and over whose head hung the\r\nsword of revolutionary vengeance.\r\n\r\nRazumov, remembering the thick-set man with his heavy jowl resting on\r\nthe collar of his uniform, the champion of autocracy, who had let no\r\nsign of surprise, incredulity, or joy escape him, but whose goggle eyes\r\ncould express a mortal hatred of all rebellion--Razumov moved uneasily\r\non the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe suspected me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he must suspect everybody. He\r\nwould be capable of suspecting his own wife, if Haldin had gone to her\r\nboudoir with his confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov sat up in anguish. Was he to remain a political suspect all his\r\ndays? Was he to go through life as a man not wholly to be trusted--with\r\na bad secret police note tacked on to his record? What sort of future\r\ncould he look forward to?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am now a suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought again; but the habit of reflection and\r\nthat desire of safety, of an ordered life, which was so strong in him\r\ncame to his assistance as the night wore on. His quiet, steady, and\r\nlaborious existence would vouch at length for his loyalty. There were\r\nmany permitted ways to serve one\xe2\x80\x99s country. There was an activity that\r\nmade for progress without being revolutionary. The field of influence\r\nwas great and infinitely varied--once one had conquered a name.\r\n\r\nHis thought like a circling bird reverted after four-and-twenty hours to\r\nthe silver medal, and as it were poised itself there.\r\n\r\nWhen the day broke he had not slept, not for a moment, but he got up\r\nnot very tired and quite sufficiently self-possessed for all practical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nHe went out and attended three lectures in the morning. But the work in\r\nthe library was a mere dumb show of research. He sat with many volumes\r\nopen before him trying to make notes and extracts. His new tranquillity\r\nwas like a flimsy garment, and seemed to float at the mercy of a casual\r\nword. Betrayal! Why! the fellow had done all that was necessary to\r\nbetray himself. Precious little had been needed to deceive him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said no word to him that was not strictly true. Not one word,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumov argued with himself.\r\n\r\nOnce engaged on this line of thought there could be no question of doing\r\nuseful work. The same ideas went on passing through his mind, and he\r\npronounced mentally the same words over and over again. He shut up all\r\nthe books and rammed all his papers into his pocket with convulsive\r\nmovements, raging inwardly against Haldin.\r\n\r\nAs he was leaving the library a long bony student in a threadbare\r\novercoat joined him, stepping moodily by his side. Razumov answered his\r\nmumbled greeting without looking at him at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought with a strange dread of the\r\nunexpected which he tried to shake off lest it should fasten itself\r\nupon his life for good and all. And the other, muttering cautiously with\r\ndowncast eyes, supposed that his comrade had seen the news of de P---\xe2\x80\x98s\r\nexecutioner--that was the expression he used--having been arrested the\r\nnight before last....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been ill--shut up in my rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov mumbled through his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe tall student, raising his shoulders, shoved his hands deep into his\r\npockets. He had a hairless, square, tallowy chin which trembled slightly\r\nas he spoke, and his nose nipped bright red by the sharp air looked like\r\na false nose of painted cardboard between the sallow cheeks. His whole\r\nappearance was stamped with the mark of cold and hunger. He stalked\r\ndeliberately at Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s elbow with his eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an official statement,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in the same cautious mutter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a lie. But there was somebody arrested between midnight and\r\none in the morning on Tuesday. This is certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd talking rapidly under the cover of his downcast air, he told Razumov\r\nthat this was known through an inferior Government clerk employed at\r\nthe Central Secretariat. That man belonged to one of the revolutionary\r\ncircles. \xe2\x80\x9cThe same, in fact, I am affiliated to,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the student.\r\n\r\nThey were crossing a wide quadrangle. An infinite distress possessed\r\nRazumov, annihilated his energy, and before his eyes everything appeared\r\nconfused and as if evanescent. He dared not leave the fellow there. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nmay be affiliated to the police,\xe2\x80\x9d was the thought that passed through\r\nhis mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWho could tell?\xe2\x80\x9d But eyeing the miserable frost-nipped,\r\nfamine-struck figure of his companion he perceived the absurdity of his\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I--you know--I don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to any circle. I....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dared not say any more. Neither dared he mend his pace. The\r\nother, raising and setting down his lamentably shod feet with exact\r\ndeliberation, protested in a low tone that it was not necessary for\r\neverybody to belong to an organization. The most valuable personalities\r\nremained outside. Some of the best work was done outside the\r\norganization. Then very fast, with whispering, feverish lips--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man arrested in the street was Haldin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd accepting Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s dismayed silence as natural enough, he assured\r\nhim that there was no mistake. That Government clerk was on night duty\r\nat the Secretariat. Hearing a great noise of footsteps in the hall and\r\naware that political prisoners were brought over sometimes at night from\r\nthe fortress, he opened the door of the room in which he was working,\r\nsuddenly. Before the gendarme on duty could push him back and slam the\r\ndoor in his face, he had seen a prisoner being partly carried, partly\r\ndragged along the hall by a lot of policemen. He was being used very\r\nbrutally. And the clerk had recognized Haldin perfectly. Less than half\r\nan hour afterwards General T--- arrived at the Secretariat to examine\r\nthat prisoner personally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you astonished?\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the gaunt student.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov roughly--and at once regretted his answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody supposed Haldin was in the provinces--with his people. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe student turned his big hollow eyes upon Razumov, who said\r\nunguardedly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis people are abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could have bitten his tongue out with vexation. The student\r\npronounced in a tone of profound meaning--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! You alone were aware,...\xe2\x80\x9d and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have sworn my ruin,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you spoken of this to\r\nanyone else?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with bitter curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe other shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, only to you. Our circle thought that as Haldin had been often heard\r\nexpressing a warm appreciation of your character....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov could not restrain a gesture of angry despair which the other\r\nmust have misunderstood in some way, because he ceased speaking and\r\nturned away his black, lack-lustre eyes.\r\n\r\nThey moved side by side in silence. Then the gaunt student began to\r\nwhisper again, with averted gaze--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we have at present no one affiliated inside the fortress so as\r\nto make it possible to furnish him with a packet of poison, we have\r\nconsidered already some sort of retaliatory action--to follow very\r\nsoon....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov trudging on interrupted--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you acquainted with Haldin? Did he know where you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the happiness to hear him speak twice,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion answered in\r\nthe feverish whisper contrasting with the gloomy apathy of his face and\r\nbearing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did not know where I live.... I am lodging poorly with\r\nan artisan family.... I have just a corner in a room. It is not very\r\npracticable to see me there, but if you should need me for anything I am\r\nready....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov trembled with rage and fear. He was beside himself, but kept his\r\nvoice low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to come near me. You are not to speak to me. Never address\r\na single word to me. I forbid you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other submissively, showing no surprise whatever\r\nat this abrupt prohibition. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t wish for secret reasons...\r\nperfectly... I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe edged away at once, not looking up even; and Razumov saw his gaunt,\r\nshabby, famine-stricken figure cross the street obliquely with lowered\r\nhead and that peculiar exact motion of the feet.\r\n\r\nHe watched him as one would watch a vision out of a nightmare, then he\r\ncontinued on his way, trying not to think. On his landing the landlady\r\nseemed to be waiting for him. She was a short, thick, shapeless woman\r\nwith a large yellow face wrapped up everlastingly in a black woollen\r\nshawl. When she saw him come up the last flight of stairs she flung both\r\nher arms up excitedly, then clasped her hands before her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirylo Sidorovitch--little father--what have you been doing? And such\r\na quiet young man, too! The police are just gone this moment after\r\nsearching your rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov gazed down at her with silent, scrutinizing attention. Her puffy\r\nyellow countenance was working with emotion. She screwed up her eyes at\r\nhim entreatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a sensible young man! Anybody can see you are sensible. And\r\nnow--like this--all at once.... What is the good of mixing yourself\r\nup with these Nihilists? Do give over, little father. They are unlucky\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov moved his shoulders slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr is it that some secret enemy has been calumniating you, Kirylo\r\nSidorovitch? The world is full of black hearts and false denunciations\r\nnowadays. There is much fear about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard that I have been denounced by some one?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Razumov,\r\nwithout taking his eyes off her quivering face.\r\n\r\nBut she had not heard anything. She had tried to find out by asking\r\nthe police captain while his men were turning the room upside down. The\r\npolice captain of the district had known her for the last eleven years\r\nand was a humane person. But he said to her on the landing, looking very\r\nblack and vexed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good woman, do not ask questions. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything myself. The\r\norder comes from higher quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there had appeared, shortly after the arrival of the\r\npolicemen of the district, a very superior gentleman in a fur coat and\r\na shiny hat, who sat down in the room and looked through all the papers\r\nhimself. He came alone and went away by himself, taking nothing with\r\nhim. She had been trying to put things straight a little since they\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nRazumov turned away brusquely and entered his rooms.\r\n\r\nAll his books had been shaken and thrown on the floor. His landlady\r\nfollowed him, and stooping painfully began to pick them up into her\r\napron. His papers and notes which were kept always neatly sorted (they\r\nall related to his studies) had been shuffled up and heaped together\r\ninto a ragged pile in the middle of the table.\r\n\r\nThis disorder affected him profoundly, unreasonably. He sat down\r\nand stared. He had a distinct sensation of his very existence being\r\nundermined in some mysterious manner, of his moral supports falling away\r\nfrom him one by one. He even experienced a slight physical giddiness and\r\nmade a movement as if to reach for something to steady himself with.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, rising to her feet with a low groan, shot all the\r\nbooks she had collected in her apron on to the sofa and left the room\r\nmuttering and sighing.\r\n\r\nIt was only then that he noticed that the sheet of paper which for one\r\nnight had remained stabbed to the wall above his empty bed was lying on\r\ntop of the pile.\r\n\r\nWhen he had taken it down the day before he had folded it in four,\r\nabsent-mindedly, before dropping it on the table. And now he saw it\r\nlying uppermost, spread out, smoothed out even and covering all the\r\nconfused pile of pages, the record of his intellectual life for the\r\nlast three years. It had not been flung there. It had been placed\r\nthere--smoothed out, too! He guessed in that an intention of profound\r\nmeaning--or perhaps some inexplicable mockery.\r\n\r\nHe sat staring at the piece of paper till his eyes began to smart. He\r\ndid not attempt to put his papers in order, either that evening or the\r\nnext day--which he spent at home in a state of peculiar irresolution.\r\nThis irresolution bore upon the question whether he should continue to\r\nlive--neither more nor less. But its nature was very far removed from\r\nthe hesitation of a man contemplating suicide. The idea of laying\r\nviolent hands upon his body did not occur to Razumov. The unrelated\r\norganism bearing that label, walking, breathing, wearing these clothes,\r\nwas of no importance to anyone, unless maybe to the landlady. The true\r\nRazumov had his being in the willed, in the determined future--in that\r\nfuture menaced by the lawlessness of autocracy--for autocracy knows\r\nno law--and the lawlessness of revolution. The feeling that his moral\r\npersonality was at the mercy of these lawless forces was so strong that\r\nhe asked himself seriously if it were worth while to go on accomplishing\r\nthe mental functions of that existence which seemed no longer his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the good of exerting my intelligence, of pursuing the\r\nsystematic development of my faculties and all my plans of work?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to guide my conduct by reasonable convictions,\r\nbut what security have I against something--some destructive\r\nhorror--walking in upon me as I sit here?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov looked apprehensively towards the door of the outer room as if\r\nexpecting some shape of evil to turn the handle and appear before him\r\nsilently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA common thief,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cfinds more guarantees in the law\r\nhe is breaking, and even a brute like Ziemianitch has his consolation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumov envied the materialism of the thief and the passion of the\r\nincorrigible lover. The consequences of their actions were always clear\r\nand their lives remained their own.\r\n\r\nBut he slept as soundly that night as though he had been consoling\r\nhimself in the manner of Ziemianitch. He dropped off suddenly, lay like\r\na log, remembered no dream on waking. But it was as if his soul had gone\r\nout in the night to gather the flowers of wrathful wisdom. He got up in\r\na mood of grim determination and as if with a new knowledge of his own\r\nnature. He looked mockingly on the heap of papers on his table; and left\r\nhis room to attend the lectures, muttering to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in no humour to talk to anybody or hear himself questioned as\r\nto his absence from lectures the day before. But it was difficult to\r\nrepulse rudely a very good comrade with a smooth pink face and fair\r\nhair, bearing the nickname amongst his fellow-students of \xe2\x80\x9cMadcap\r\nKostia.\xe2\x80\x9d He was the idolized only son of a very wealthy and illiterate\r\nGovernment contractor, and attended the lectures only during the\r\nperiodical fits of contrition following upon tearful paternal\r\nremonstrances. Noisily blundering like a retriever puppy, his elated\r\nvoice and great gestures filled the bare academy corridors with the\r\njoy of thoughtless animal life, provoking indulgent smiles at a great\r\ndistance. His usual discourses treated of trotting horses, wine-parties\r\nin expensive restaurants, and the merits of persons of easy virtue,\r\nwith a disarming artlessness of outlook. He pounced upon Razumov about\r\nmidday, somewhat less uproariously than his habit was, and led him\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a moment, Kirylo Sidorovitch. A few words here in this quiet\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance, and insinuated his hand under his arm\r\ncaressingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--pray do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk to you about any of my silly scrapes.\r\nWhat are my scrapes? Absolutely nothing. Mere childishness. The other\r\nnight I flung a fellow out of a certain place where I was having a\r\nfairly good time. A tyrannical little beast of a quill-driver from the\r\nTreasury department. He was bullying the people of the house. I rebuked\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x98You are not behaving humanely to God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures that are a jolly\r\nsight more estimable than yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see any\r\ntyranny, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Upon my word I can\xe2\x80\x99t. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it in\r\ngood part at all. \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that impudent puppy?\xe2\x80\x99 he begins to shout. I\r\nwas in excellent form as it happened, and he went through the closed\r\nwindow very suddenly. He flew quite a long way into the yard. I raged\r\nlike--like a--minotaur. The women clung to me and screamed, the fiddlers\r\ngot under the table.... Such fun! My dad had to put his hand pretty\r\ndeep into his pocket, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d He chuckled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dad is a very useful man. Jolly good thing it is for me, too. I do\r\nget into unholy scrapes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis elation fell. That was just it. What was his life? Insignificant;\r\nno good to anyone; a mere festivity. It would end some fine day in his\r\ngetting his skull split with a champagne bottle in a drunken brawl. At\r\nsuch times, too, when men were sacrificing themselves to ideas. But he\r\ncould never get any ideas into his head. His head wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth anything\r\nbetter than to be split by a champagne bottle.\r\n\r\nRazumov, protesting that he had no time, made an attempt to get away.\r\nThe other\xe2\x80\x99s tone changed to confidential earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Kirylo, my dear soul, let me make some sort of\r\nsacrifice. It would not be a sacrifice really. I have my rich dad behind\r\nme. There\xe2\x80\x99s positively no getting to the bottom of his pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd rejecting indignantly Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that this was drunken\r\nraving, he offered to lend him some money to escape abroad with. He\r\ncould always get money from his dad. He had only to say that he had\r\nlost it at cards or something of that sort, and at the same time promise\r\nsolemnly not to miss a single lecture for three months on end. That\r\nwould fetch the old man; and he, Kostia, was quite equal to the\r\nsacrifice. Though he really did not see what was the good for him to\r\nattend the lectures. It was perfectly hopeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you let me be of some use?\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded to the silent Razumov,\r\nwho with his eyes on the ground and utterly unable to penetrate the real\r\ndrift of the other\xe2\x80\x99s intention, felt a strange reluctance to clear up\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think I want to go abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last very\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nKostia lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had the police in your rooms yesterday. There are three or four of\r\nus who have heard of that. Never mind how we know. It is sufficient that\r\nwe do. So we have been consulting together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You got to know that so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumov negligently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. We did. And it struck us that a man like you...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a man do you take me to be?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man of ideas--and a man of action too. But you are very deep, Kirylo.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no getting to the bottom of your mind. Not for fellows like me.\r\nBut we all agreed that you must be preserved for our country. Of that we\r\nhave no doubt whatever--I mean all of us who have heard Haldin speak of\r\nyou on certain occasions. A man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the police ransacking his\r\nrooms without there being some devilry hanging over his head.... And\r\nso if you think that it would be better for you to bolt at once....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov tore himself away and walked down the corridor, leaving the\r\nother motionless with his mouth open. But almost at once he returned\r\nand stood before the amazed Kostia, who shut his mouth slowly. Razumov\r\nlooked him straight in the eyes, before saying with marked deliberation\r\nand separating his words--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank--you--very--much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went away again rapidly. Kostia, recovering from his surprise at\r\nthese manoeuvres, ran up behind him pressingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Wait! Listen. I really mean it. It would be like giving your\r\ncompassion to a starving fellow. Do you hear, Kirylo? And any disguise\r\nyou may think of, that too I could procure from a costumier, a Jew I\r\nknow. Let a fool be made serviceable according to his folly. Perhaps\r\nalso a false beard or something of that kind may be needed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRazumov turned at bay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no false beards needed in this business, Kostia--you\r\ngood-hearted lunatic, you. What do you know of my ideas? My ideas may be\r\npoison to you.\xe2\x80\x9d The other began to shake his head in energetic protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got to do with ideas? Some of them would make an end\r\nof your dad\xe2\x80\x99s money-bags. Leave off meddling with what you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand. Go back to your trotting horses and your girls, and then\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure at least of doing no harm to anybody, and hardly any to\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic youth was overcome by this disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sending me back to my pig\xe2\x80\x99s trough, Kirylo. That settles it. I\r\nam an unlucky beast--and I shall die like a beast too. But mind--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour contempt that has done for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov went off with long strides. That this simple and grossly festive\r\nsoul should have fallen too under the revolutionary curse affected him\r\nas an ominous symptom of the time. He reproached himself for feeling\r\ntroubled. Personally he ought to have felt reassured. There was an\r\nobvious advantage in this conspiracy of mistaken judgment taking him for\r\nwhat he was not. But was it not strange?\r\n\r\nAgain he experienced that sensation of his conduct being taken out of\r\nhis hands by Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary tyranny. His solitary and laborious\r\nexistence had been destroyed--the only thing he could call his own on\r\nthis earth. By what right? he asked himself furiously. In what name?\r\n\r\nWhat infuriated him most was to feel that the \xe2\x80\x9cthinkers\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nUniversity were evidently connecting him with Haldin--as a sort of\r\nconfidant in the background apparently. A mysterious connexion! Ha ha!\r\n...He had been made a personage without knowing anything about it. How\r\nthat wretch Haldin must have talked about him! Yet it was likely that\r\nHaldin had said very little. The fellow\xe2\x80\x99s casual utterances were caught\r\nup and treasured and pondered over by all these imbeciles. And was not\r\nall secret revolutionary action based upon folly, self-deception, and\r\nlies?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible to think of anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumov to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll become an idiot if this goes on. The scoundrels and the fools are\r\nmurdering my intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lost all hope of saving his future, which depended on the free use of\r\nhis intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe reached the doorway of his house in a state of mental discouragement\r\nwhich enabled him to receive with apparent indifference an\r\nofficial-looking envelope from the dirty hand of the dvornik.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gendarme brought it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe asked if you were at home.\r\nI told him \xe2\x80\x98No, he\xe2\x80\x99s not at home.\xe2\x80\x99 So he left it. \xe2\x80\x98Give it into his own\r\nhands,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. Now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to his sweeping, and Razumov climbed his stairs, envelope\r\nin hand. Once in his room he did not hasten to open it. Of course\r\nthis official missive was from the superior direction of the police. A\r\nsuspect! A suspect!\r\n\r\nHe stared in dreary astonishment at the absurdity of his position. He\r\nthought with a sort of dry, unemotional melancholy; three years of good\r\nwork gone, the course of forty more perhaps jeopardized--turned from\r\nhope to terror, because events started by human folly link themselves\r\ninto a sequence which no sagacity can foresee and no courage can break\r\nthrough. Fatality enters your rooms while your landlady\xe2\x80\x99s back is\r\nturned; you come home and find it in possession bearing a man\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nclothed in flesh--wearing a brown cloth coat and long boots--lounging\r\nagainst the stove. It asks you, \xe2\x80\x9cIs the outer door closed?\xe2\x80\x9d--and you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know enough to take it by the throat and fling it downstairs. You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. You welcome the crazy fate. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d you say. And it is\r\nall over. You cannot shake it off any more. It will cling to you for\r\never. Neither halter nor bullet can give you back the freedom of your\r\nlife and the sanity of your thought.... It was enough to dash one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead against a wall.\r\n\r\nRazumov looked slowly all round the walls as if to select a spot to dash\r\nhis head against. Then he opened the letter. It directed the student\r\nKirylo Sidorovitch Razumov to present himself without delay at the\r\nGeneral Secretariat.\r\n\r\nRazumov had a vision of General T---\xe2\x80\x98s goggle eyes waiting for him--the\r\nembodied power of autocracy, grotesque and terrible. He embodied\r\nthe whole power of autocracy because he was its guardian. He was the\r\nincarnate suspicion, the incarnate anger, the incarnate ruthlessness of\r\na political and social regime on its defence. He loathed rebellion\r\nby instinct. And Razumov reflected that the man was simply unable to\r\nunderstand a reasonable adherence to the doctrine of absolutism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he want with me precisely--I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself.\r\n\r\nAs if that mental question had evoked the familiar phantom, Haldin stood\r\nsuddenly before him in the room with an extraordinary completeness of\r\ndetail. Though the short winter day had passed already into the sinister\r\ntwilight of a land buried in snow, Razumov saw plainly the narrow\r\nleather strap round the Tcherkess coat. The illusion of that hateful\r\npresence was so perfect that he half expected it to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs the outer\r\ndoor closed?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at it with hatred and contempt. Souls do not\r\ntake a shape of clothing. Moreover, Haldin could not be dead yet.\r\nRazumov stepped forward menacingly; the vision vanished--and turning\r\nshort on his heel he walked out of his room with infinite disdain.\r\n\r\nBut after going down the first flight of stairs it occurred to him that\r\nperhaps the superior authorities of police meant to confront him with\r\nHaldin in the flesh. This thought struck him like a bullet, and had he\r\nnot clung with both hands to the banister he would have rolled down to\r\nthe next landing most likely. His legs were of no use for a considerable\r\ntime.... But why? For what conceivable reason? To what end?\r\n\r\nThere could be no rational answer to these questions; but Razumov\r\nremembered the promise made by the General to Prince K---. His action\r\nwas to remain unknown.\r\n\r\nHe got down to the bottom of the stairs, lowering himself as it were\r\nfrom step to step, by the banister. Under the gate he regained much of\r\nhis firmness of thought and limb. He went out into the street without\r\nstaggering visibly. Every moment he felt steadier mentally. And yet\r\nhe was saying to himself that General T--- was perfectly capable of\r\nshutting him up in the fortress for an indefinite time. His temperament\r\nfitted his remorseless task, and his omnipotence made him inaccessible\r\nto reasonable argument.\r\n\r\nBut when Razumov arrived at the Secretariat he discovered that he would\r\nhave nothing to do with General T---. It is evident from Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiary that this dreaded personality was to remain in the background. A\r\ncivilian of superior rank received him in a private room after a period\r\nof waiting in outer offices where a lot of scribbling went on at many\r\ntables in a heated and stuffy atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe clerk in uniform who conducted him said in the corridor--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going before Gregor Matvieitch Mikulin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing formidable about the man bearing that name. His mild,\r\nexpectant glance was turned on the door already when Razumov entered.\r\nAt once, with the penholder he was holding in his hand, he pointed to a\r\ndeep sofa between two windows. He followed Razumov with his eyes while\r\nthat last crossed the room and sat down. The mild gaze rested on him,\r\nnot curious, not inquisitive--certainly not suspicious--almost\r\nwithout expression. In its passionless persistence there was something\r\nresembling sympathy.\r\n\r\nRazumov, who had prepared his will and his intelligence to encounter\r\nGeneral T--- himself, was profoundly troubled. All the moral bracing\r\nup against the possible excesses of power and passion went for nothing\r\nbefore this sallow man, who wore a full unclipped beard. It was\r\nfair, thin, and very fine. The light fell in coppery gleams on the\r\nprotuberances of a high, rugged forehead. And the aspect of the broad,\r\nsoft physiognomy was so homely and rustic that the careful middle\r\nparting of the hair seemed a pretentious affectation.\r\n\r\nThe diary of Mr. Razumov testifies to some irritation on his part. I may\r\nremark here that the diary proper consisting of the more or less daily\r\nentries seems to have been begun on that very evening after Mr. Razumov\r\nhad returned home.\r\n\r\nMr. Razumov, then, was irritated. His strung-up individuality had gone\r\nto pieces within him very suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be very prudent with him,\xe2\x80\x9d he warned himself in the silence\r\nduring which they sat gazing at each other. It lasted some little time,\r\nand was characterized (for silences have their character) by a sort of\r\nsadness imparted to it perhaps by the mild and thoughtful manner of\r\nthe bearded official. Razumov learned later that he was the chief of a\r\ndepartment in the General Secretariat, with a rank in the civil service\r\nequivalent to that of a colonel in the army.\r\n\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s mistrust became acute. The main point was, not to be drawn\r\ninto saying too much. He had been called there for some reason. What\r\nreason? To be given to understand that he was a suspect--and also no\r\ndoubt to be pumped. As to what precisely? There was nothing. Or perhaps\r\nHaldin had been telling lies.... Every alarming uncertainty beset\r\nRazumov. He could bear the silence no longer, and cursing himself for\r\nhis weakness spoke first, though he had promised himself not to do so on\r\nany account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t lost a moment\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d he began in a hoarse, provoking tone;\r\nand then the faculty of speech seemed to leave him and enter the body of\r\nCouncillor Mikulin, who chimed in approvingly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery proper. Very proper. Though as a matter of fact....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the spell was broken, and Razumov interrupted him boldly, under\r\na sudden conviction that this was the safest attitude to take. With a\r\ngreat flow of words he complained of being totally misunderstood. Even\r\nas he talked with a perception of his own audacity he thought that\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cmisunderstood\xe2\x80\x9d was better than the word \xe2\x80\x9cmistrusted,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nrepeated it again with insistence. Suddenly he ceased, being seized\r\nwith fright before the attentive immobility of the official. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am\r\nI talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, eyeing him with a vague gaze.\r\nMistrusted--not misunderstood--was the right symbol for these people.\r\nMisunderstood was the other kind of curse. Both had been brought on his\r\nhead by that fellow Haldin. And his head ached terribly. He passed his\r\nhand over his brow--an involuntary gesture of suffering, which he was\r\ntoo careless to restrain. At that moment Razumov beheld his own brain\r\nsuffering on the rack--a long, pale figure drawn asunder horizontally\r\nwith terrific force in the darkness of a vault, whose face he failed to\r\nsee. It was as though he had dreamed for an infinitesimal fraction of\r\ntime of some dark print of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be seriously supposed that Razumov had actually dozed off\r\nand had dreamed in the presence of Councillor Mikulin, of an old print\r\nof the Inquisition. He was indeed extremely exhausted, and he records\r\na remarkably dream-like experience of anguish at the circumstance\r\nthat there was no one whatever near the pale and extended figure. The\r\nsolitude of the racked victim was particularly horrible to behold. The\r\nmysterious impossibility to see the face, he also notes, inspired a sort\r\nof terror. All these characteristics of an ugly dream were present. Yet\r\nhe is certain that he never lost the consciousness of himself on the\r\nsofa, leaning forward with his hands between his knees and turning his\r\ncap round and round in his fingers. But everything vanished at the voice\r\nof Councillor Mikulin. Razumov felt profoundly grateful for the even\r\nsimplicity of its tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have listened with interest. I comprehend in a measure your...\r\nBut, indeed, you are mistaken in what you....\xe2\x80\x9d Councillor Mikulin\r\nuttered a series of broken sentences. Instead of finishing them he\r\nglanced down his beard. It was a deliberate curtailment which somehow\r\nmade the phrases more impressive. But he could talk fluently enough, as\r\nbecame apparent when changing his tone to persuasiveness he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nlistening to you as I did, I think I have proved that I do not regard\r\nour intercourse as strictly official. In fact, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to have\r\nthat character at all.... Oh yes! I admit that the request for your\r\npresence here had an official form. But I put it to you whether it was a\r\nform which would have been used to secure the attendance of a....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspect,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Razumov, looking straight into the official\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes. They were big with heavy eyelids, and met his boldness with a dim,\r\nsteadfast gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cA suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d The open repetition of that word which\r\nhad been haunting all his waking hours gave Razumov a strange sort of\r\nsatisfaction. Councillor Mikulin shook his head slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely you do\r\nknow that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my rooms searched by the police?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to say a \xe2\x80\x98misunderstood person,\xe2\x80\x99 when you interrupted me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n insinuated quietly Councillor Mikulin.\r\n\r\nRazumov smiled without bitterness. The renewed sense of his intellectual\r\nsuperiority sustained him in the hour of danger. He said a little\r\ndisdainfully--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am but a reed. But I beg you to allow me the superiority of\r\nthe thinking reed over the unthinking forces that are about to crush\r\nhim out of existence. Practical thinking in the last instance is but\r\ncriticism. I may perhaps be allowed to express my wonder at this action\r\nof the police being delayed for two full days during which, of course,\r\nI could have annihilated everything compromising by burning it--let us\r\nsay--and getting rid of the very ashes, for that matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are angry,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the official, with an unutterable simplicity\r\nof tone and manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that reasonable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov felt himself colouring with annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am reasonable. I am even--permit me to say--a thinker, though to\r\nbe sure, this name nowadays seems to be the monopoly of hawkers of\r\nrevolutionary wares, the slaves of some French or German thought--devil\r\nknows what foreign notions. But I am not an intellectual mongrel. I\r\nthink like a Russian. I think faithfully--and I take the liberty to call\r\nmyself a thinker. It is not a forbidden word, as far as I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Why should it be a forbidden word?\xe2\x80\x9d Councillor Mikulin turned in\r\nhis seat with crossed legs and resting his elbow on the table propped\r\nhis head on the knuckles of a half-closed hand. Razumov noticed a thick\r\nforefinger clasped by a massive gold band set with a blood-red stone--a\r\nsignet ring that, looking as if it could weigh half a pound, was\r\nan appropriate ornament for that ponderous man with the accurate\r\nmiddle-parting of glossy hair above a rugged Socratic forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould it be a wig?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov detected himself wondering with an\r\nunexpected detachment. His self-confidence was much shaken. He resolved\r\nto chatter no more. Reserve! Reserve! All he had to do was to keep\r\nthe Ziemianitch episode secret with absolute determination, when the\r\nquestions came. Keep Ziemianitch strictly out of all the answers.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin looked at him dimly. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s self-confidence\r\nabandoned him completely. It seemed impossible to keep Ziemianitch out.\r\nEvery question would lead to that, because, of course, there was nothing\r\nelse. He made an effort to brace himself up. It was a failure. But\r\nCouncillor Mikulin was surprisingly detached too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it be forbidden?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI too consider myself\r\na thinking man, I assure you. The principal condition is to think\r\ncorrectly. I admit it is difficult sometimes at first for a young man\r\nabandoned to himself--with his generous impulses undisciplined, so to\r\nspeak--at the mercy of every wild wind that blows. Religious belief, of\r\ncourse, is a great....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin glanced down his beard, and Razumov, whose tension\r\nwas relaxed by that unexpected and discursive turn, murmured with gloomy\r\ndiscontent--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man, Haldin, believed in God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You are aware,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed out Councillor Mikulin, making the point\r\nsoftly, as if with discretion, but making it nevertheless plainly\r\nenough, as if he too were put off his guard by Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s remark.\r\nThe young man preserved an impassive, moody countenance, though he\r\nreproached himself bitterly for a pernicious fool, to have given thus an\r\nutterly false impression of intimacy. He kept his eyes on the floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must positively hold my tongue unless I am obliged to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadmonished himself. And at once against his will the question, \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI better tell him everything?\xe2\x80\x9d presented itself with such force that he\r\nhad to bite his lower lip. Councillor Mikulin could not, however, have\r\nnourished any hope of confession. He went on--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me more than his judges were able to get out of him. He was\r\njudged by a commission of three. He would tell them absolutely nothing.\r\nI have the report of the interrogatories here, by me. After every\r\nquestion there stands \xe2\x80\x98Refuses to answer--refuses to answer.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\nthat page after page. You see, I have been entrusted with some further\r\ninvestigations around and about this affair. He has left me nothing to\r\nbegin my investigations on. A hardened miscreant. And so, you say, he\r\nbelieved in....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Councillor Mikulin glanced down his beard with a faint grimace;\r\nbut he did not pause for long. Remarking with a shade of scorn that\r\nblasphemers also had that sort of belief, he concluded by supposing that\r\nMr. Razumov had conversed frequently with Haldin on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov loudly, without looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cHe talked and I\r\nlistened. That is not a conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListening is a great art,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mikulin parenthetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd getting people to talk is another,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no--that is not very difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d Mikulin said innocently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexcept, of course, in special cases. For instance, this Haldin. Nothing\r\ncould induce him to talk. He was brought four times before the delegated\r\njudges. Four secret interrogatories--and even during the last, when your\r\npersonality was put forward....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy personality put forward?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Razumov, raising his head\r\nbrusquely. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d Councillor Mikulin turned squarely to\r\nthe table, and taking up some sheets of grey foolscap dropped them one\r\nafter another, retaining only the last in his hand. He held it before\r\nhis eyes while speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was--you see--judged necessary. In a case of that gravity no means\r\nof action upon the culprit should be neglected. You understand that\r\nyourself, I am certain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRazumov stared with enormous wide eyes at the side view of Councillor\r\nMikulin, who now was not looking at him at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was decided (I was consulted by General T---) that a certain\r\nquestion should be put to the accused. But in deference to the earnest\r\nwishes of Prince K--- your name has been kept out of the documents\r\nand even from the very knowledge of the judges themselves. Prince K---\r\nrecognized the propriety, the necessity of what we proposed to do, but\r\nhe was concerned for your safety. Things do leak out--that we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeny. One cannot always answer for the discretion of inferior officials.\r\nThere was, of course, the secretary of the special tribunal--one or two\r\ngendarmes in the room. Moreover, as I have said, in deference to Prince\r\nK--- even the judges themselves were to be left in ignorance. The\r\nquestion ready framed was sent to them by General T--- (I wrote it out\r\nwith my own hand) with instructions to put it to the prisoner the very\r\nlast of all. Here it is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouncillor Mikulin threw back his head into proper focus and went on\r\nreading monotonously: \xe2\x80\x98Question--Has the man well known to you, in whose\r\nrooms you remained for several hours on Monday and on whose information\r\nyou have been arrested--has he had any previous knowledge of your\r\nintention to commit a political murder?...\xe2\x80\x99 Prisoner refuses to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion repeated. Prisoner preserves the same stubborn silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe venerable Chaplain of the Fortress being then admitted and\r\nexhorting the prisoner to repentance, entreating him also to atone for\r\nhis crime by an unreserved and full confession which should help to\r\nliberate from the sin of rebellion against the Divine laws and the\r\nsacred Majesty of the Ruler, our Christ-loving land--the prisoner opens\r\nhis lips for the first time during this morning\xe2\x80\x99s audience and in a\r\nloud, clear voice rejects the venerable Chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s ministrations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the Court pronounces in summary form the death\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe execution is fixed for four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, subject to\r\nfurther instructions from superior authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin dropped the page of foolscap, glanced down his beard,\r\nand turning to Razumov, added in an easy, explanatory tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw no object in delaying the execution. The order to carry out the\r\nsentence was sent by telegraph at noon. I wrote out the telegram myself.\r\nHe was hanged at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe definite information of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s death gave Razumov the feeling of\r\ngeneral lassitude which follows a great exertion or a great excitement.\r\nHe kept very still on the sofa, but a murmur escaped him--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a belief in a future existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin shrugged his shoulders slightly, and Razumov got up\r\nwith an effort. There was nothing now to stay for in that room. Haldin\r\nhad been hanged at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There could be no doubt of that. He\r\nhad, it seemed, entered upon his future existence, long boots, Astrakhan\r\nfur cap and all, down to the very leather strap round his waist. A\r\nflickering, vanishing sort of existence. It was not his soul, it was his\r\nmere phantom he had left behind on this earth--thought Razumov, smiling\r\ncaustically to himself while he crossed the room, utterly forgetful of\r\nwhere he was and of Councillor Mikulin\xe2\x80\x99s existence. The official could\r\nhave set a lot of bells ringing all over the building without leaving\r\nhis chair. He let Razumov go quite up to the door before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Kirylo Sidorovitch--what are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov turned his head and looked at him in silence. He was not in the\r\nleast disconcerted. Councillor Mikulin\xe2\x80\x99s arms were stretched out on the\r\ntable before him and his body leaned forward a little with an effort of\r\nhis dim gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas I actually going to clear out like this?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov wondered\r\nat himself with an impassive countenance. And he was aware of this\r\nimpassiveness concealing a lucid astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently I was going out if he had not spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nwould he have done then? I must end this affair one way or another. I\r\nmust make him show his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment longer he reflected behind the mask as it were, then let go\r\nthe door-handle and came back to the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said explosively, but not raising his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think that you are dealing with a secret accomplice of that\r\nunhappy man. No, I do not know that he was unhappy. He did not tell me.\r\nHe was a wretch from my point of view, because to keep alive a false\r\nidea is a greater crime than to kill a man. I suppose you will not deny\r\nthat? I hated him! Visionaries work everlasting evil on earth. Their\r\nUtopias inspire in the mass of mediocre minds a disgust of reality and a\r\ncontempt for the secular logic of human development.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov shrugged his shoulders and stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a tirade!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\nThe silence and immobility of Councillor Mikulin impressed him. The\r\nbearded bureaucrat sat at his post, mysteriously self-possessed like an\r\nidol with dim, unreadable eyes. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s voice changed involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were to ask me where is the necessity of my hate for such as\r\nHaldin, I would answer you--there is nothing sentimental in it. I did\r\nnot hate him because he had committed the crime of murder. Abhorrence is\r\nnot hate. I hated him simply because I am sane. It is in that character\r\nthat he outraged me. His death...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov felt his voice growing thick in his throat. The dimness of\r\nCouncillor Mikulin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes seemed to spread all over his face and made it\r\nindistinct to Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s sight. He tried to disregard these phenomena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, pronouncing each word carefully, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is his\r\ndeath to me? If he were lying here on the floor I could walk over his\r\nbreast.... The fellow is a mere phantom....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s voice died out very much against his will. Mikulin behind the\r\ntable did not allow himself the slightest movement. The silence lasted\r\nfor some little time before Razumov could go on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went about talking of me. Those intellectual fellows sit in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s rooms and get drunk on foreign ideas in the same way young\r\nGuards\xe2\x80\x99 officers treat each other with foreign wines. Merest debauchery.\r\n...Upon my Word,\xe2\x80\x9d--Razumov, enraged by a sudden recollection of\r\nZiemianitch, lowered his voice forcibly,--\xe2\x80\x9cupon my word, we Russians are\r\na drunken lot. Intoxication of some sort we must have: to get ourselves\r\nwild with sorrow or maudlin with resignation; to lie inert like a log or\r\nset fire to the house. What is a sober man to do, I should like to know?\r\nTo cut oneself entirely from one\xe2\x80\x99s kind is impossible. To live in\r\na desert one must be a saint. But if a drunken man runs out of the\r\ngrog-shop, falls on your neck and kisses you on both cheeks because\r\nsomething about your appearance has taken his fancy, what then--kindly\r\ntell me? You may break, perhaps, a cudgel on his back and yet not\r\nsucceed in beating him off....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin raised his hand and passed it down his face\r\ndeliberately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s... of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an undertone.\r\n\r\nThe quiet gravity of that gesture made Razumov pause. It was so\r\nunexpected, too. What did it mean? It had an alarming aloofness. Razumov\r\nremembered his intention of making him show his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said all this to Prince K---,\xe2\x80\x9d he began with assumed\r\nindifference, but lost it on seeing Councillor Mikulin\xe2\x80\x99s slow nod of\r\nassent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it? You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard.... Then why should I be called\r\nhere to be told of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s execution? Did you want to confront me with\r\nhis silence now that the man is dead? What is his silence to me! This is\r\nincomprehensible. You want in some way to shake my moral balance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not that,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Councillor Mikulin, just audibly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe service\r\nyou have rendered is appreciated....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Razumov ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c...and your position too.\xe2\x80\x9d Councillor Mikulin did not raise his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut only think! You fall into Prince K---\xe2\x80\x98s study as if from\r\nthe sky with your startling information.... You are studying yet,\r\nMr. Razumov, but we are serving already--don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that.... And\r\nnaturally some curiosity was bound to....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin looked down his beard. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s lips trembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn occurrence of that sort marks a man,\xe2\x80\x9d the homely murmur went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nadmit I was curious to see you. General T--- thought it would be useful,\r\ntoo.... Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am incapable of understanding your sentiments.\r\nWhen I was young like you I studied....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--you wished to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov in a tone of profound\r\ndistaste. \xe2\x80\x9cNaturally you have the right--I mean the power. It all\r\namounts to the same thing. But it is perfectly useless, if you were\r\nto look at me and listen to me for a year. I begin to think there\r\nis something about me which people don\xe2\x80\x99t seem able to make out. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunfortunate. I imagine, however, that Prince K--- understands. He seemed\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin moved slightly and spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince K--- is aware of everything that is being done, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind informing you that he approved my intention of becoming personally\r\nacquainted with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov concealed an immense disappointment under the accents of railing\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he is curious too!... Well--after all, Prince K--- knows me very\r\nlittle. It is really very unfortunate for me, but--it is not exactly my\r\nfault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin raised a hasty deprecatory hand and inclined his head\r\nslightly over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Razumov--is it necessary to take it in that way? Everybody I\r\nam sure can....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced rapidly down his beard, and when he looked up again there\r\nwas for a moment an interested expression in his misty gaze. Razumov\r\ndiscouraged it with a cold, repellent smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. That\xe2\x80\x99s of no importance to be sure--except that in respect of all\r\nthis curiosity being aroused by a very simple matter.... What is to\r\nbe done with it? It is unappeasable. I mean to say there is nothing to\r\nappease it with. I happen to have been born a Russian with patriotic\r\ninstincts--whether inherited or not I am not in a position to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov spoke consciously with elaborate steadiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, patriotic instincts developed by a faculty of independent\r\nthinking--of detached thinking. In that respect I am more free than any\r\nsocial democratic revolution could make me. It is more than probable\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t think exactly as you are thinking. Indeed, how could it be?\r\nYou would think most likely at this moment that I am elaborately lying\r\nto cover up the track of my repentance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov stopped. His heart had grown too big for his breast. Councillor\r\nMikulin did not flinch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI assisted personally at the search of your\r\nrooms. I looked through all the papers myself. I have been greatly\r\nimpressed by a sort of political confession of faith. A very remarkable\r\ndocument. Now may I ask for what purpose....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo deceive the police naturally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov savagely.... \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nall this mockery? Of course you can send me straight from this room\r\nto Siberia. That would be intelligible. To what is intelligible I can\r\nsubmit. But I protest against this comedy of persecution. The whole\r\naffair is becoming too comical altogether for my taste. A comedy of\r\nerrors, phantoms, and suspicions. It\xe2\x80\x99s positively indecent....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin turned an attentive ear. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you say phantoms?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could walk over dozens of them.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov, with an impatient wave of\r\nhis hand, went on headlong, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, really, I must claim the right to be\r\ndone once for all with that man. And in order to accomplish this I shall\r\ntake the liberty....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov on his side of the table bowed slightly to the seated\r\nbureaucrat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... To retire--simply to retire,\xe2\x80\x9d he finished with great resolution.\r\n\r\nHe walked to the door, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cNow he must show his hand. He must\r\nring and have me arrested before I am out of the building, or he must\r\nlet me go. And either way....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn unhurried voice said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirylo Sidorovitch.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov at the door turned his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo retire,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Councillor Mikulin softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of an invented story there are, no doubt, certain\r\nproprieties to be observed for the sake of clearness and effect. A man\r\nof imagination, however inexperienced in the art of narrative, has his\r\ninstinct to guide him in the choice of his words, and in the development\r\nof the action. A grain of talent excuses many mistakes. But this is not\r\na work of imagination; I have no talent; my excuse for this undertaking\r\nlies not in its art, but in its artlessness. Aware of my limitations and\r\nstrong in the sincerity of my purpose, I would not try (were I able) to\r\ninvent anything. I push my scruples so far that I would not even invent\r\na transition.\r\n\r\nDropping then Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s record at the point where Councillor\r\nMikulin\xe2\x80\x99s question \xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d comes in with the force of an insoluble\r\nproblem, I shall simply say that I made the acquaintance of these ladies\r\nabout six months before that time. By \xe2\x80\x9cthese ladies\xe2\x80\x9d I mean, of course,\r\nthe mother and the sister of the unfortunate Haldin.\r\n\r\nBy what arguments he had induced his mother to sell their little\r\nproperty and go abroad for an indefinite time, I cannot tell precisely.\r\nI have an idea that Mrs. Haldin, at her son\xe2\x80\x99s wish, would have set fire\r\nto her house and emigrated to the moon without any sign of surprise or\r\napprehension; and that Miss Haldin--Nathalie, caressingly Natalka--would\r\nhave given her assent to the scheme.\r\n\r\nTheir proud devotion to that young man became clear to me in a\r\nvery short time. Following his directions they went straight to\r\nSwitzerland--to Zurich--where they remained the best part of a year.\r\nFrom Zurich, which they did not like, they came to Geneva. A friend\r\nof mine in Lausanne, a lecturer in history at the University (he had\r\nmarried a Russian lady, a distant connection of Mrs. Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s), wrote to\r\nme suggesting I should call on these ladies. It was a very kindly\r\nmeant business suggestion. Miss Haldin wished to go through a course of\r\nreading the best English authors with a competent teacher.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haldin received me very kindly. Her bad French, of which she was\r\nsmilingly conscious, did away with the formality of the first interview.\r\nShe was a tall woman in a black silk dress. A wide brow, regular\r\nfeatures, and delicately cut lips, testified to her past beauty. She sat\r\nupright in an easy chair and in a rather weak, gentle voice told me that\r\nher Natalka simply thirsted after knowledge. Her thin hands were lying\r\non her lap, her facial immobility had in it something monachal. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nRussia,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9call knowledge was tainted with falsehood. Not\r\nchemistry and all that, but education generally,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained.\r\nThe Government corrupted the teaching for its own purposes. Both her\r\nchildren felt that. Her Natalka had obtained a diploma of a Superior\r\nSchool for Women and her son was a student at the St. Petersburg\r\nUniversity. He had a brilliant intellect, a most noble unselfish nature,\r\nand he was the oracle of his comrades. Early next year, she hoped he\r\nwould join them and they would then go to Italy together. In any other\r\ncountry but their own she would have been certain of a great future for\r\na man with the extraordinary abilities and the lofty character of her\r\nson--but in Russia....\r\n\r\nThe young lady sitting by the window turned her head and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, mother. Even with us things change with years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice was deep, almost harsh, and yet caressing in its harshness.\r\nShe had a dark complexion, with red lips and a full figure. She gave the\r\nimpression of strong vitality. The old lady sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are both young--you two. It is easy for you to hope. But I, too, am\r\nnot hopeless. Indeed, how could I be with a son like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI addressed Miss Haldin, asking her what authors she wished to read. She\r\ndirected upon me her grey eyes shaded by black eyelashes, and I\r\nbecame aware, notwithstanding my years, how attractive physically\r\nher personality could be to a man capable of appreciating in a woman\r\nsomething else than the mere grace of femininity. Her glance was as\r\ndirect and trustful as that of a young man yet unspoiled by the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwise lessons. And it was intrepid, but in this intrepidity there\r\nwas nothing aggressive. A naive yet thoughtful assurance is a better\r\ndefinition. She had reflected already (in Russia the young begin to\r\nthink early), but she had never known deception as yet because obviously\r\nshe had never yet fallen under the sway of passion. She was--to look at\r\nher was enough--very capable of being roused by an idea or simply by\r\na person. At least, so I judged with I believe an unbiassed mind; for\r\nclearly my person could not be the person--and as to my ideas!...\r\n\r\nWe became excellent friends in the course of our reading. It was very\r\npleasant. Without fear of provoking a smile, I shall confess that I\r\nbecame very much attached to that young girl. At the end of four\r\nmonths I told her that now she could very well go on reading English\r\nby herself. It was time for the teacher to depart. My pupil looked\r\nunpleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haldin, with her immobility of feature and kindly expression of the\r\neyes, uttered from her armchair in her uncertain French, \xe2\x80\x9c_Mais l\xe2\x80\x99ami\r\nreviendra._\xe2\x80\x9d And so it was settled. I returned--not four times a week\r\nas before, but pretty frequently. In the autumn we made some short\r\nexcursions together in company with other Russians. My friendship with\r\nthese ladies gave me a standing in the Russian colony which otherwise I\r\ncould not have had.\r\n\r\nThe day I saw in the papers the news of Mr. de P---\xe2\x80\x98s assassination--it\r\nwas a Sunday--I met the two ladies in the street and walked with them\r\nfor some distance. Mrs. Haldin wore a heavy grey cloak, I remember,\r\nover her black silk dress, and her fine eyes met mine with a very quiet\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been to the late service,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNatalka came with me.\r\nHer girl-friends, the students here, of course don\xe2\x80\x99t.... With us in\r\nRussia the church is so identified with oppression, that it seems almost\r\nnecessary when one wishes to be free in this life, to give up all hope\r\nof a future existence. But I cannot give up praying for my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe added with a sort of stony grimness, colouring slightly, and\r\nin French, \xe2\x80\x9c_Ce n\xe2\x80\x99est peut etre qu\xe2\x80\x99une habitude._\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be only\r\nhabit.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin was carrying the prayer-book. She did not glance at her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and Victor are both profound believers,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nI communicated to them the news from their country which I had just\r\nread in a cafe. For a whole minute we walked together fairly briskly in\r\nsilence. Then Mrs. Haldin murmured--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be more trouble, more persecutions for this. They may be\r\neven closing the University. There is neither peace nor rest in Russia\r\nfor one but in the grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The way is hard,\xe2\x80\x9d came from the daughter, looking straight before\r\nher at the Chain of Jura covered with snow, like a white wall closing\r\nthe end of the street. \xe2\x80\x9cBut concord is not so very far off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what my children think,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Haldin to me.\r\n\r\nI did not conceal my feeling that these were strange times to talk of\r\nconcord. Nathalie Haldin surprised me by saying, as if she had thought\r\nvery much on the subject, that the occidentals did not understand the\r\nsituation. She was very calm and youthfully superior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it is a class conflict, or a conflict of interests, as\r\nsocial contests are with you in Europe. But it is not that at all. It is\r\nsomething quite different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite possible that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted.\r\n\r\nThat propensity of lifting every problem from the plane of the\r\nunderstandable by means of some sort of mystic expression, is very\r\nRussian. I knew her well enough to have discovered her scorn for all\r\nthe practical forms of political liberty known to the western world.\r\nI suppose one must be a Russian to understand Russian simplicity, a\r\nterrible corroding simplicity in which mystic phrases clothe a naive and\r\nhopeless cynicism. I think sometimes that the psychological secret\r\nof the profound difference of that people consists in this, that they\r\ndetest life, the irremediable life of the earth as it is, whereas\r\nwe westerners cherish it with perhaps an equal exaggeration of its\r\nsentimental value. But this is a digression indeed....\r\n\r\nI helped these ladies into the tramcar and they asked me to call in\r\nthe afternoon. At least Mrs. Haldin asked me as she climbed up, and her\r\nNatalka smiled down at the dense westerner indulgently from the rear\r\nplatform of the moving car. The light of the clear wintry forenoon was\r\nsoftened in her grey eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s record, like the open book of fate, revives for me the\r\nmemory of that day as something startlingly pitiless in its freedom from\r\nall forebodings. Victor Haldin was still with the living, but with the\r\nliving whose only contact with life is the expectation of death. He must\r\nhave been already referring to the last of his earthly affections, the\r\nhours of that obstinate silence, which for him was to be prolonged into\r\neternity. That afternoon the ladies entertained a good many of their\r\ncompatriots--more than was usual for them to receive at one time; and\r\nthe drawing-room on the ground floor of a large house on the Boulevard\r\ndes Philosophes was very much crowded.\r\n\r\nI outstayed everybody; and when I rose Miss Haldin stood up too. I took\r\nher hand and was moved to revert to that morning\xe2\x80\x99s conversation in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmitting that we occidentals do not understand the character of\r\nyour...\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\nIt was as if she had been prepared for me by some mysterious\r\nfore-knowledge. She checked me gently--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir impulses--their...\xe2\x80\x9d she sought the proper expression and found\r\nit, but in French... _\xe2\x80\x9ctheir mouvements d\xe2\x80\x99ame._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice was not much above a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut still we are looking at a conflict. You say\r\nit is not a conflict of classes and not a conflict of interests. Suppose\r\nI admitted that. Are antagonistic ideas then to be reconciled more\r\neasily--can they be cemented with blood and violence into that concord\r\nwhich you proclaim to be so near?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me searchingly with her clear grey eyes, without answering\r\nmy reasonable question--my obvious, my unanswerable question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is inconceivable,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, with something like annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is inconceivable,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole world is\r\ninconceivable to the strict logic of ideas. And yet the world exists to\r\nour senses, and we exist in it. There must be a necessity superior to\r\nour conceptions. It is a very miserable and a very false thing to belong\r\nto the majority. We Russians shall find some better form of national\r\nfreedom than an artificial conflict of parties--which is wrong because\r\nit is a conflict and contemptible because it is artificial. It is left\r\nfor us Russians to discover a better way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Haldin had been looking out of the window. She turned upon me the\r\nalmost lifeless beauty of her face, and the living benign glance of her\r\nbig dark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what my children think,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d I addressed Miss Haldin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will be shocked if I\r\ntell you that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t understood--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say a single word; I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nunderstood all the words.... But what can be this era of disembodied\r\nconcord you are looking forward to. Life is a thing of form. It has its\r\nplastic shape and a definite intellectual aspect. The most idealistic\r\nconceptions of love and forbearance must be clothed in flesh as it were\r\nbefore they can be made understandable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took my leave of Mrs. Haldin, whose beautiful lips never stirred. She\r\nsmiled with her eyes only. Nathalie Haldin went with me as far as the\r\ndoor, very amiable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother imagines that I am the slavish echo of my brother Victor. It\r\nis not so. He understands me better than I can understand him. When he\r\njoins us and you come to know him you will see what an exceptional soul\r\nit is.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not a strong man in the conventional sense,\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut his character is without a flaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that it will not be difficult for me to make friends with\r\nyour brother Victor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t expect to understand him quite,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little maliciously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not at all--at all--western at bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd on this unnecessary warning I left the room with another bow in\r\nthe doorway to Mrs. Haldin in her armchair by the window. The shadow of\r\nautocracy all unperceived by me had already fallen upon the Boulevard\r\ndes Philosophes, in the free, independent and democratic city of\r\nGeneva, where there is a quarter called \xe2\x80\x9cLa Petite Russie.\xe2\x80\x9d Whenever two\r\nRussians come together, the shadow of autocracy is with them, tinging\r\ntheir thoughts, their views, their most intimate feelings, their private\r\nlife, their public utterances--haunting the secret of their silences.\r\n\r\nWhat struck me next in the course of a week or so was the silence of\r\nthese ladies. I used to meet them walking in the public garden near the\r\nUniversity. They greeted me with their usual friendliness, but I could\r\nnot help noticing their taciturnity. By that time it was generally known\r\nthat the assassin of M. de P--- had been caught, judged, and executed.\r\nSo much had been declared officially to the news agencies. But for the\r\nworld at large he remained anonymous. The official secrecy had withheld\r\nhis name from the public. I really cannot imagine for what reason.\r\n\r\nOne day I saw Miss Haldin walking alone in the main valley of the\r\nBastions under the naked trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother is not very well,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Haldin had, it seemed, never had a day\xe2\x80\x99s illness in her life,\r\nthis indisposition was disquieting. It was nothing definite, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is fretting because we have not heard from my brother for\r\nrather a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo news--good news,\xe2\x80\x9d I said cheerfully, and we began to walk slowly\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d she breathed out so low that I only just caught the\r\nwords. I looked at her with more attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou too are anxious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe admitted after a moment of hesitation that she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is really such a long time since we heard....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd before I could offer the usual banal suggestions she confided in me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! But it is much worse than that. I wrote to a family we know in\r\nPetersburg. They had not seen him for more than a month. They thought\r\nhe was already with us. They were even offended a little that he should\r\nhave left Petersburg without calling on them. The husband of the lady\r\nwent at once to his lodgings. Victor had left there and they did not\r\nknow his address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remember her catching her breath rather pitifully. Her brother had not\r\nbeen seen at lectures for a very long time either. He only turned up now\r\nand then at the University gate to ask the porter for his letters. And\r\nthe gentleman friend was told that the student Haldin did not come to\r\nclaim the last two letters for him. But the police came to inquire if\r\nthe student Haldin ever received any correspondence at the University\r\nand took them away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy two last letters,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nWe faced each other. A few snow-flakes fluttered under the naked boughs.\r\nThe sky was dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think could have happened?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHer shoulders moved slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can never tell--in Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw then the shadow of autocracy lying upon Russian lives in their\r\nsubmission or their revolt. I saw it touch her handsome open face\r\nnestled in a fur collar and darken her clear eyes that shone upon me\r\nbrilliantly grey in the murky light of a beclouded, inclement afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us move on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is cold standing--to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered a little and stamped her little feet. We moved briskly to\r\nthe end of the alley and back to the great gates of the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you told your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not yet. I came out to walk off the impression of this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard a rustle of paper somewhere. It came from her muff. She had the\r\nletter with her in there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that you are afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nTo us Europeans of the West, all ideas of political plots and\r\nconspiracies seem childish, crude inventions for the theatre or a novel.\r\nI did not like to be more definite in my inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor us--for my mother specially, what I am afraid of is incertitude.\r\nPeople do disappear. Yes, they do disappear. I leave you to imagine what\r\nit is--the cruelty of the dumb weeks--months--years! This friend of ours\r\nhas abandoned his inquiries when he heard of the police getting hold of\r\nthe letters. I suppose he was afraid of compromising himself. He has a\r\nwife and children--and why should he, after all.... Moreover, he is\r\nwithout influential connections and not rich. What could he do?...\r\nYes, I am afraid of silence--for my poor mother. She won\xe2\x80\x99t be able\r\nto bear it. For my brother I am afraid of...\xe2\x80\x9d she became almost\r\nindistinct, \xe2\x80\x9cof anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were now near the gate opposite the theatre. She raised her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut lost people do turn up even in Russia. Do you know what my last\r\nhope is? Perhaps the next thing we know, we shall see him walking into\r\nour rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI raised my hat and she passed out of the gardens, graceful and strong,\r\nafter a slight movement of the head to me, her hands in the muff,\r\ncrumpling the cruel Petersburg letter.\r\n\r\nOn returning home I opened the newspaper I receive from London, and\r\nglancing down the correspondence from Russia--not the telegrams but\r\nthe correspondence--the first thing that caught my eye was the name\r\nof Haldin. Mr. de P---\xe2\x80\x98s death was no longer an actuality, but the\r\nenterprising correspondent was proud of having ferreted out some\r\nunofficial information about that fact of modern history. He had got\r\nhold of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s name, and had picked up the story of the midnight\r\narrest in the street. But the sensation from a journalistic point of\r\nview was already well in the past. He did not allot to it more than\r\ntwenty lines out of a full column. It was quite enough to give me a\r\nsleepless night. I perceived that it would have been a sort of treason\r\nto let Miss Haldin come without preparation upon that journalistic\r\ndiscovery which would infallibly be reproduced on the morrow by French\r\nand Swiss newspapers. I had a very bad time of it till the morning,\r\nwakeful with nervous worry and night-marish with the feeling of\r\nbeing mixed up with something theatrical and morbidly affected. The\r\nincongruity of such a complication in those two women\xe2\x80\x99s lives was\r\nsensible to me all night in the form of absolute anguish. It seemed due\r\nto their refined simplicity that it should remain concealed from them\r\nfor ever. Arriving at an unconscionably early hour at the door of their\r\napartment, I felt as if I were about to commit an act of vandalism....\r\n\r\nThe middle-aged servant woman led me into the drawing-room where there\r\nwas a duster on a chair and a broom leaning against the centre table.\r\nThe motes danced in the sunshine; I regretted I had not written a letter\r\ninstead of coming myself, and was thankful for the brightness of the\r\nday. Miss Haldin in a plain black dress came lightly out of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom with a fixed uncertain smile on her lips.\r\n\r\nI pulled the paper out of my pocket. I did not imagine that a number\r\nof the _Standard_ could have the effect of Medusa\xe2\x80\x99s head. Her face went\r\nstony in a moment--her eyes--her limbs. The most terrible thing was that\r\nbeing stony she remained alive. One was conscious of her palpitating\r\nheart. I hope she forgave me the delay of my clumsy circumlocution. It\r\nwas not very prolonged; she could not have kept so still from head to\r\nfoot for more than a second or two; and then I heard her draw a breath.\r\nAs if the shock had paralysed her moral resistance, and affected the\r\nfirmness of her muscles, the contours of her face seemed to have given\r\nway. She was frightfully altered. She looked aged--ruined. But only for\r\na moment. She said with decision--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to tell my mother at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould that be safe in her state?\xe2\x80\x9d I objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be worse than the state she has been in for the last month?\r\nWe understand this in another way. The crime is not at his door. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimagine I am defending him before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the bedroom door, then came back to ask me in a low murmur\r\nnot to go till she returned. For twenty interminable minutes not a sound\r\nreached me. At last Miss Haldin came out and walked across the room with\r\nher quick light step. When she reached the armchair she dropped into it\r\nheavily as if completely exhausted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haldin, she told me, had not shed a tear. She was sitting up in\r\nbed, and her immobility, her silence, were very alarming. At last she\r\nlay down gently and had motioned her daughter away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will call me in presently,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Haldin. \xe2\x80\x9cI left a bell near\r\nthe bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI confess that my very real sympathy had no standpoint. The Western\r\nreaders for whom this story is written will understand what I mean. It\r\nwas, if I may say so, the want of experience. Death is a remorseless\r\nspoliator. The anguish of irreparable loss is familiar to us all. There\r\nis no life so lonely as to be safe against that experience. But the\r\ngrief I had brought to these two ladies had gruesome associations. It\r\nhad the associations of bombs and gallows--a lurid, Russian colouring\r\nwhich made the complexion of my sympathy uncertain.\r\n\r\nI was grateful to Miss Haldin for not embarrassing me by an outward\r\ndisplay of deep feeling. I admired her for that wonderful command\r\nover herself, even while I was a little frightened at it. It was the\r\nstillness of a great tension. What if it should suddenly snap? Even the\r\ndoor of Mrs. Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s room, with the old mother alone in there, had a\r\nrather awful aspect.\r\n\r\nNathalie Haldin murmured sadly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you are wondering what my feelings are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEssentially that was true. It was that very wonder which unsettled my\r\nsympathy of a dense Occidental. I could get hold of nothing but of some\r\ncommonplace phrases, those futile phrases that give the measure of our\r\nimpotence before each other\xe2\x80\x99s trials I mumbled something to the effect\r\nthat, for the young, life held its hopes and compensations. It held\r\nduties too--but of that I was certain it was not necessary to remind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had a handkerchief in her hands and pulled at it nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not likely to forget my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe used to be three.\r\nNow we are two--two women. She\xe2\x80\x99s not so very old. She may live quite a\r\nlong time yet. What have we to look for in the future? For what hope\r\nand what consolation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take a wider view,\xe2\x80\x9d I said resolutely, thinking that with this\r\nexceptional creature this was the right note to strike. She looked at\r\nme steadily for a moment, and then the tears she had been keeping down\r\nflowed unrestrained. She jumped up and stood in the window with her back\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nI slipped away without attempting even to approach her. Next day I was\r\ntold at the door that Mrs. Haldin was better. The middle-aged servant\r\nremarked that a lot of people--Russians--had called that day, but Miss\r\nHaldin bad not seen anybody. A fortnight later, when making my daily\r\ncall, I was asked in and found Mrs. Haldin sitting in her usual place by\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nAt first one would have thought that nothing was changed. I saw\r\nacross the room the familiar profile, a little sharper in outline\r\nand overspread by a uniform pallor as might have been expected in an\r\ninvalid. But no disease could have accounted for the change in her black\r\neyes, smiling no longer with gentle irony. She raised them as she gave\r\nme her hand. I observed the three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 old number of the _Standard_\r\nfolded with the correspondence from Russia uppermost, lying on a little\r\ntable by the side of the armchair. Mrs. Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s voice was startlingly\r\nweak and colourless. Her first words to me framed a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas there been anything more in papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI released her long emaciated hand, shook my head negatively, and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe English press is wonderful. Nothing can be kept secret from it,\r\nand all the world must hear. Only our Russian news is not always easy to\r\nunderstand. Not always easy.... But English mothers do not look for\r\nnews like that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand on the newspaper and took it away again. I said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe too have had tragic times in our history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA long time ago. A very long time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are nations that have made their bargain with fate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nHaldin, who had approached us. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need not envy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy this scorn?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked gently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that our bargain was not\r\na very lofty one. But the terms men and nations obtain from Fate are\r\nhallowed by the price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Haldin turned her head away and looked out of the window for a\r\ntime, with that new, sombre, extinct gaze of her sunken eyes which so\r\ncompletely made another woman of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Englishman, this correspondent,\xe2\x80\x9d she addressed me suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou think it is possible that he knew my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this strange question I could only say that it was possible of\r\ncourse. She saw my surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one knew what sort of man he was one could perhaps write to him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother thinks,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Miss Haldin, standing between us, with one\r\nhand resting on the back of my chair, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my poor brother perhaps did\r\nnot try to save himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked up at Miss Haldin in sympathetic consternation, but Miss Haldin\r\nwas looking down calmly at her mother. The latter said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not know the address of any of his friends. Indeed, we know\r\nnothing of his Petersburg comrades. He had a multitude of young friends,\r\nonly he never spoke much of them. One could guess that they were his\r\ndisciples and that they idolized him. But he was so modest. One would\r\nthink that with so many devoted....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe averted her head again and looked down the Boulevard des\r\nPhilosophes, a singularly arid and dusty thoroughfare, where nothing\r\ncould be seen at the moment but two dogs, a little girl in a pinafore\r\nhopping on one leg, and in the distance a workman wheeling a bicycle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven amongst the Apostles of Christ there was found a Judas,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered as if to herself, but with the evident intention to be heard\r\nby me.\r\n\r\nThe Russian visitors assembled in little knots, conversed amongst\r\nthemselves meantime, in low murmurs, and with brief glances in our\r\ndirection. It was a great contrast to the usual loud volubility of these\r\ngatherings. Miss Haldin followed me into the ante-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople will come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot shut the door in their faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile I was putting on my overcoat she began to talk to me of her\r\nmother. Poor Mrs. Haldin was fretting after more news. She wanted to go\r\non hearing about her unfortunate son. She could not make up her mind to\r\nabandon him quietly to the dumb unknown. She would persist in pursuing\r\nhim in there through the long days of motionless silence face to face\r\nwith the empty Boulevard des Philosophes. She could not understand why\r\nhe had not escaped--as so many other revolutionists and conspirators\r\nhad managed to escape in other instances of that kind. It was really\r\ninconceivable that the means of secret revolutionary organisations\r\nshould have failed so inexcusably to preserve her son. But in reality\r\nthe inconceivable that staggered her mind was nothing but the cruel\r\naudacity of Death passing over her head to strike at that young and\r\nprecious heart.\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin mechanically, with an absorbed look, handed me my hat. I\r\nunderstood from her that the poor woman was possessed by the sombre and\r\nsimple idea that her son must have perished because he did not want\r\nto be saved. It could not have been that he despaired of his country\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuture. That was impossible. Was it possible that his mother and sister\r\nhad not known how to merit his confidence; and that, after having done\r\nwhat he was compelled to do, his spirit became crushed by an intolerable\r\ndoubt, his mind distracted by a sudden mistrust.\r\n\r\nI was very much shocked by this piece of ingenuity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur three lives were like that!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin twined the fingers of both\r\nher hands together in demonstration, then separated them slowly, looking\r\nstraight into my face. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what poor mother found to torment herself\r\nand me with, for all the years to come,\xe2\x80\x9d added the strange girl. At that\r\nmoment her indefinable charm was revealed to me in the conjunction of\r\npassion and stoicism. I imagined what her life was likely to be by the\r\nside of Mrs. Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s terrible immobility, inhabited by that fixed idea.\r\nBut my concern was reduced to silence by my ignorance of her modes\r\nof feeling. Difference of nationality is a terrible obstacle for our\r\ncomplex Western natures. But Miss Haldin probably was too simple to\r\nsuspect my embarrassment. She did not wait for me to say anything, but\r\nas if reading my thoughts on my face she went on courageously--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first poor mother went numb, as our peasants say; then she began to\r\nthink and she will go on now thinking and thinking in that unfortunate\r\nstrain. You see yourself how cruel that is....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never spoke with greater sincerity than when I agreed with her that it\r\nwould be deplorable in the highest degree. She took an anxious breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all these strange details in the English paper,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed\r\nsuddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of them? I suppose they are true? But is\r\nit not terrible that my poor brother should be caught wandering alone,\r\nas if in despair, about the streets at night....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe stood so close to each other in the dark anteroom that I could see\r\nher biting her lower lip to suppress a dry sob. After a short pause she\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suggested to mother that he may have been betrayed by some false\r\nfriend or simply by some cowardly creature. It may be easier for her to\r\nbelieve that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood now the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s whispered allusion to Judas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be easier,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted, admiring inwardly the directness and the\r\nsubtlety of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s outlook. She was dealing with life as it was\r\nmade for her by the political conditions of her country. She faced cruel\r\nrealities, not morbid imaginings of her own making. I could not defend\r\nmyself from a certain feeling of respect when she added simply--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime they say can soften every sort of bitterness. But I cannot believe\r\nthat it has any power over remorse. It is better that mother should\r\nthink some person guilty of Victor\xe2\x80\x99s death, than that she should connect\r\nit with a weakness of her son or a shortcoming of her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, yourself, don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that....\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\nShe compressed her lips and shook her head. She harboured no evil\r\nthoughts against any one, she declared--and perhaps nothing that\r\nhappened was unnecessary. On these words, pronounced low and sounding\r\nmysterious in the half obscurity of the ante-room, we parted with an\r\nexpressive and warm handshake. The grip of her strong, shapely hand had\r\na seductive frankness, a sort of exquisite virility. I do not know why\r\nshe should have felt so friendly to me. It may be that she thought I\r\nunderstood her much better than I was able to do. The most precise\r\nof her sayings seemed always to me to have enigmatical prolongations\r\nvanishing somewhere beyond my reach. I am reduced to suppose that she\r\nappreciated my attention and my silence. The attention she could see was\r\nquite sincere, so that the silence could not be suspected of coldness.\r\nIt seemed to satisfy her. And it is to be noted that if she confided\r\nin me it was clearly not with the expectation of receiving advice, for\r\nwhich, indeed she never asked.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nOur daily relations were interrupted at this period for something like a\r\nfortnight. I had to absent myself unexpectedly from Geneva. On my return\r\nI lost no time in directing my steps up the Boulevard des Philosophes.\r\n\r\nThrough the open door of the drawing-room I was annoyed to hear a\r\nvisitor holding forth steadily in an unctuous deep voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s armchair by the window stood empty. On the sofa, Nathalie\r\nHaldin raised her charming grey eyes in a glance of greeting accompanied\r\nby the merest hint of a welcoming smile. But she made no movement. With\r\nher strong white hands lying inverted in the lap of her mourning dress\r\nshe faced a man who presented to me a robust back covered with black\r\nbroadcloth, and well in keeping with the deep voice. He turned his head\r\nsharply over his shoulder, but only for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! your English friend. I know. I know. That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wore spectacles with smoked glasses, a tall silk hat stood on the\r\nfloor by the side of his chair. Flourishing slightly a big soft hand he\r\nwent on with his discourse, precipitating his delivery a little more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never changed the faith I held while wandering in the forests\r\nand bogs of Siberia. It sustained me then--it sustains me now. The great\r\nPowers of Europe are bound to disappear--and the cause of their collapse\r\nwill be very simple. They will exhaust themselves struggling against\r\ntheir proletariat. In Russia it is different. In Russia we have no\r\nclasses to combat each other, one holding the power of wealth, and\r\nthe other mighty with the strength of numbers. We have only an unclean\r\nbureaucracy in the face of a people as great and as incorruptible as\r\nthe ocean. No, we have no classes. But we have the Russian woman. The\r\nadmirable Russian woman! I receive most remarkable letters signed by\r\nwomen. So elevated in tone, so courageous, breathing such a noble ardour\r\nof service! The greatest part of our hopes rests on women. I behold\r\ntheir thirst for knowledge. It is admirable. Look how they absorb, how\r\nthey are making it their own. It is miraculous. But what is knowledge?\r\n...I understand that you have not been studying anything\r\nespecially--medicine for instance. No? That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Had I been honoured\r\nby being asked to advise you on the use of your time when you arrived\r\nhere I would have been strongly opposed to such a course. Knowledge in\r\nitself is mere dross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had one of those bearded Russian faces without shape, a mere\r\nappearance of flesh and hair with not a single feature having any sort\r\nof character. His eyes being hidden by the dark glasses there was an\r\nutter absence of all expression. I knew him by sight. He was a Russian\r\nrefugee of mark. All Geneva knew his burly black-coated figure. At one\r\ntime all Europe was aware of the story of his life written by himself\r\nand translated into seven or more languages. In his youth he had led\r\nan idle, dissolute life. Then a society girl he was about to marry died\r\nsuddenly and thereupon he abandoned the world of fashion, and began\r\nto conspire in a spirit of repentance, and, after that, his native\r\nautocracy took good care that the usual things should happen to him.\r\nHe was imprisoned in fortresses, beaten within an inch of his life, and\r\ncondemned to work in mines, with common criminals. The great success of\r\nhis book, however, was the chain.\r\n\r\nI do not remember now the details of the weight and length of the\r\nfetters riveted on his limbs by an \xe2\x80\x9cAdministrative\xe2\x80\x9d order, but it was in\r\nthe number of pounds and the thickness of links an appalling assertion\r\nof the divine right of autocracy. Appalling and futile too, because this\r\nbig man managed to carry off that simple engine of government with him\r\ninto the woods. The sensational clink of these fetters is heard all\r\nthrough the chapters describing his escape--a subject of wonder to two\r\ncontinents. He had begun by concealing himself successfully from\r\nhis guard in a hole on a river bank. It was the end of the day; with\r\ninfinite labour he managed to free one of his legs. Meantime night\r\nfell. He was going to begin on his other leg when he was overtaken by a\r\nterrible misfortune. He dropped his file.\r\n\r\nAll this is precise yet symbolic; and the file had its pathetic history.\r\nIt was given to him unexpectedly one evening, by a quiet, pale-faced\r\ngirl. The poor creature had come out to the mines to join one of his\r\nfellow convicts, a delicate young man, a mechanic and a social democrat,\r\nwith broad cheekbones and large staring eyes. She had worked her way\r\nacross half Russia and nearly the whole of Siberia to be near him, and,\r\nas it seems, with the hope of helping him to escape. But she arrived too\r\nlate. Her lover had died only a week before.\r\n\r\nThrough that obscure episode, as he says, in the history of ideas in\r\nRussia, the file came into his hands, and inspired him with an ardent\r\nresolution to regain his liberty. When it slipped through his fingers it\r\nwas as if it had gone straight into the earth. He could by no manner of\r\nmeans put his hand on it again in the dark. He groped systematically\r\nin the loose earth, in the mud, in the water; the night was passing\r\nmeantime, the precious night on which he counted to get away into the\r\nforests, his only chance of escape. For a moment he was tempted by\r\ndespair to give up; but recalling the quiet, sad face of the heroic\r\ngirl, he felt profoundly ashamed of his weakness. She had selected him\r\nfor the gift of liberty and he must show himself worthy of the favour\r\nconferred by her feminine, indomitable soul. It appeared to be a sacred\r\ntrust. To fail would have been a sort of treason against the sacredness\r\nof self-sacrifice and womanly love.\r\n\r\nThere are in his book whole pages of self-analysis whence emerges like\r\na white figure from a dark confused sea the conviction of woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspiritual superiority--his new faith confessed since in several volumes.\r\nHis first tribute to it, the great act of his conversion, was his\r\nextraordinary existence in the endless forests of the Okhotsk Province,\r\nwith the loose end of the chain wound about his waist. A strip torn off\r\nhis convict shirt secured the end firmly. Other strips fastened it at\r\nintervals up his left leg to deaden the clanking and to prevent the\r\nslack links from getting hooked in the bushes. He became very fierce.\r\nHe developed an unsuspected genius for the arts of a wild and hunted\r\nexistence. He learned to creep into villages without betraying his\r\npresence by anything more than an occasional faint jingle. He broke into\r\nouthouses with an axe he managed to purloin in a wood-cutters\xe2\x80\x99 camp. In\r\nthe deserted tracts of country he lived on wild berries and hunted for\r\nhoney. His clothing dropped off him gradually. His naked tawny figure\r\nglimpsed vaguely through the bushes with a cloud of mosquitoes and flies\r\nhovering about the shaggy head, spread tales of terror through whole\r\ndistricts. His temper grew savage as the days went by, and he was\r\nglad to discover that that there was so much of a brute in him. He had\r\nnothing else to put his trust in. For it was as though there had been\r\ntwo human beings indissolubly joined in that enterprise. The civilized\r\nman, the enthusiast of advanced humanitarian ideals thirsting for the\r\ntriumph of spiritual love and political liberty; and the stealthy,\r\nprimeval savage, pitilessly cunning in the preservation of his freedom\r\nfrom day to day, like a tracked wild beast.\r\n\r\nThe wild beast was making its way instinctively eastward to the Pacific\r\ncoast, and the civilised humanitarian in fearful anxious dependence\r\nwatched the proceedings with awe. Through all these weeks he could never\r\nmake up his mind to appeal to human compassion. In the wary primeval\r\nsavage this shyness might have been natural, but the other too, the\r\ncivilized creature, the thinker, the escaping \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d had developed\r\nan absurd form of morbid pessimism, a form of temporary insanity,\r\noriginating perhaps in the physical worry and discomfort of the chain.\r\nThese links, he fancied, made him odious to the rest of mankind. It\r\nwas a repugnant and suggestive load. Nobody could feel any pity at the\r\ndisgusting sight of a man escaping with a broken chain. His imagination\r\nbecame affected by his fetters in a precise, matter-of-fact manner.\r\nIt seemed to him impossible that people could resist the temptation of\r\nfastening the loose end to a staple in the wall while they went for the\r\nnearest police official. Crouching in holes or hidden in thickets, he\r\nhad tried to read the faces of unsuspecting free settlers working in the\r\nclearings or passing along the paths within a foot or two of his\r\neyes. His feeling was that no man on earth could be trusted with the\r\ntemptation of the chain.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, he chanced to come upon a solitary woman. It was on an\r\nopen slope of rough grass outside the forest. She sat on the bank of a\r\nnarrow stream; she had a red handkerchief on her head and a small basket\r\nwas lying on the ground near her hand. At a little distance could be\r\nseen a cluster of log cabins, with a water-mill over a dammed pool\r\nshaded by birch trees and looking bright as glass in the twilight. He\r\napproached her silently, his hatchet stuck in his iron belt, a thick\r\ncudgel in his hand; there were leaves and bits of twig in his tangled\r\nhair, in his matted beard; bunches of rags he had wound round the links\r\nfluttered from his waist. A faint clink of his fetters made the woman\r\nturn her head. Too terrified by this savage apparition to jump up or\r\neven to scream, she was yet too stout-hearted to faint.... Expecting\r\nnothing less than to be murdered on the spot she covered her eyes with\r\nher hands to avoid the sight of the descending axe. When at last she\r\nfound courage to look again, she saw the shaggy wild man sitting on\r\nthe bank six feet away from her. His thin, sinewy arms hugged his naked\r\nlegs; the long beard covered the knees on which he rested his chin; all\r\nthese clasped, folded limbs, the bare shoulders, the wild head with red\r\nstaring eyes, shook and trembled violently while the bestial creature\r\nwas making efforts to speak. It was six weeks since he had heard the\r\nsound of his own voice. It seemed as though he had lost the faculty\r\nof speech. He had become a dumb and despairing brute, till the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsudden, unexpected cry of profound pity, the insight of her feminine\r\ncompassion discovering the complex misery of the man under the\r\nterrifying aspect of the monster, restored him to the ranks of humanity.\r\nThis point of view is presented in his book, with a very effective\r\neloquence. She ended, he says, by shedding tears over him, sacred,\r\nredeeming tears, while he also wept with joy in the manner of a\r\nconverted sinner. Directing him to hide in the bushes and wait patiently\r\n(a police patrol was expected in the Settlement) she went away towards\r\nthe houses, promising to return at night.\r\n\r\nAs if providentially appointed to be the newly wedded wife of the\r\nvillage blacksmith, the woman persuaded her husband to come out with\r\nher, bringing some tools of his trade, a hammer, a chisel, a small\r\nanvil.... \xe2\x80\x9cMy fetters\xe2\x80\x9d--the book says--\xe2\x80\x9cwere struck off on the banks\r\nof the stream, in the starlight of a calm night by an athletic, taciturn\r\nyoung man of the people, kneeling at my feet, while the woman like a\r\nliberating genius stood by with clasped hands.\xe2\x80\x9d Obviously a symbolic\r\ncouple. At the same time they furnished his regained humanity with some\r\ndecent clothing, and put heart into the new man by the information that\r\nthe seacoast of the Pacific was only a very few miles away. It could be\r\nseen, in fact, from the top of the next ridge....\r\n\r\nThe rest of his escape does not lend itself to mystic treatment and\r\nsymbolic interpretation. He ended by finding his way to the West by\r\nthe Suez Canal route in the usual manner. Reaching the shores of South\r\nEurope he sat down to write his autobiography--the great literary\r\nsuccess of its year. This book was followed by other books written with\r\nthe declared purpose of elevating humanity. In these works he preached\r\ngenerally the cult of the woman. For his own part he practised it under\r\nthe rites of special devotion to the transcendental merits of a certain\r\nMadame de S--, a lady of advanced views, no longer very young, once\r\nupon a time the intriguing wife of a now dead and forgotten diplomat.\r\nHer loud pretensions to be one of the leaders of modern thought and of\r\nmodern sentiment, she sheltered (like Voltaire and Mme. de Stael) on the\r\nrepublican territory of Geneva. Driving through the streets in her big\r\nlandau she exhibited to the indifference of the natives and the stares\r\nof the tourists a long-waisted, youthful figure of hieratic stiffness,\r\nwith a pair of big gleaming eyes, rolling restlessly behind a short veil\r\nof black lace, which, coming down no further than her vividly red lips,\r\nresembled a mask. Usually the \xe2\x80\x9cheroic fugitive\xe2\x80\x9d (this name was bestowed\r\nupon him in a review of the English edition of his book)--the \xe2\x80\x9cheroic\r\nfugitive\xe2\x80\x9d accompanied her, sitting, portentously bearded and darkly\r\nbespectacled, not by her side, but opposite her, with his back to the\r\nhorses. Thus, facing each other, with no one else in the roomy carriage,\r\ntheir airings suggested a conscious public manifestation. Or it may have\r\nbeen unconscious. Russian simplicity often marches innocently on the\r\nedge of cynicism for some lofty purpose. But it is a vain enterprise for\r\nsophisticated Europe to try and understand these doings. Considering the\r\nair of gravity extending even to the physiognomy of the coachman and the\r\naction of the showy horses, this quaint display might have possessed\r\na mystic significance, but to the corrupt frivolity of a Western mind,\r\nlike my own, it seemed hardly decent.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not becoming for an obscure teacher of languages to\r\ncriticize a \xe2\x80\x9cheroic fugitive\xe2\x80\x9d of worldwide celebrity. I was aware from\r\nhearsay that he was an industrious busy-body, hunting up his compatriots\r\nin hotels, in private lodgings, and--I was told--conferring upon them\r\nthe honour of his notice in public gardens when a suitable opening\r\npresented itself. I was under the impression that after a visit or\r\ntwo, several months before, he had given up the ladies Haldin--no doubt\r\nreluctantly, for there could be no question of his being a determined\r\nperson. It was perhaps to be expected that he should reappear again on\r\nthis terrible occasion, as a Russian and a revolutionist, to say the\r\nright thing, to strike the true, perhaps a comforting, note. But I did\r\nnot like to see him sitting there. I trust that an unbecoming jealousy\r\nof my privileged position had nothing to do with it. I made no claim to\r\na special standing for my silent friendship. Removed by the difference\r\nof age and nationality as if into the sphere of another existence, I\r\nproduced, even upon myself, the effect of a dumb helpless ghost, of an\r\nanxious immaterial thing that could only hover about without the power\r\nto protect or guide by as much as a whisper. Since Miss Haldin with her\r\nsure instinct had refrained from introducing me to the burly celebrity,\r\nI would have retired quietly and returned later on, had I not met a\r\npeculiar expression in her eyes which I interpreted as a request to\r\nstay, with the view, perhaps, of shortening an unwelcome visit.\r\n\r\nHe picked up his hat, but only to deposit it on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again, Natalia Victorovna. To-day I have called only\r\nto mark those feelings towards your honoured mother and yourself,\r\nthe nature of which you cannot doubt. I needed no urging, but\r\nEleanor--Madame de S-- herself has in a way sent me. She extends to you\r\nthe hand of feminine fellowship. There is positively in all the range\r\nof human sentiments no joy and no sorrow that woman cannot understand,\r\nelevate, and spiritualize by her interpretation. That young man newly\r\narrived from St. Petersburg, I have mentioned to you, is already under\r\nthe charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point Miss Haldin got up abruptly. I was glad. He did not\r\nevidently expect anything so decisive and, at first, throwing his head\r\nback, he tilted up his dark glasses with bland curiosity. At last,\r\nrecollecting himself, he stood up hastily, seizing his hat off his knees\r\nwith great adroitness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it, Natalia Victorovna, that you have kept aloof so long, from\r\nwhat after all is--let disparaging tongues say what they like--a unique\r\ncentre of intellectual freedom and of effort to shape a high conception\r\nof our future? In the case of your honoured mother I understand in a\r\nmeasure. At her age new ideas--new faces are not perhaps.... But you!\r\nWas it mistrust--or indifference? You must come out of your reserve.\r\nWe Russians have no right to be reserved with each other. In our\r\ncircumstances it is almost a crime against humanity. The luxury of\r\nprivate grief is not for us. Nowadays the devil is not combated by\r\nprayers and fasting. And what is fasting after all but starvation. You\r\nmust not starve yourself, Natalia Victorovna. Strength is what we want.\r\nSpiritual strength, I mean. As to the other kind, what could withstand\r\nus Russians if we only put it forth? Sin is different in our day, and\r\nthe way of salvation for pure souls is different too. It is no longer to\r\nbe found in monasteries but in the world, in the...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deep sound seemed to rise from under the floor, and one felt steeped\r\nin it to the lips. Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s interruption resembled the effort of\r\na drowning person to keep above water. She struck in with an accent of\r\nimpatience--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Peter Ivanovitch, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to retire into a monastery. Who\r\nwould look for salvation there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke figuratively,\xe2\x80\x9d he boomed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I am speaking figuratively too. But sorrow is sorrow and\r\npain is pain in the old way. They make their demands upon people. One\r\nhas got to face them the best way one can. I know that the blow which\r\nhas fallen upon us so unexpectedly is only an episode in the fate of a\r\npeople. You may rest assured that I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that. But just now\r\nI have to think of my mother. How can you expect me to leave her to\r\nherself...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is putting it in a very crude way,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested in his great\r\neffortless voice.\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin did not wait for the vibration to die out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd run about visiting amongst a lot of strange people. The idea is\r\ndistasteful for me; and I do not know what else you may mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe towered before her, enormous, deferential, cropped as close as a\r\nconvict and this big pinkish poll evoked for me the vision of a wild\r\nhead with matted locks peering through parted bushes, glimpses of naked,\r\ntawny limbs slinking behind the masses of sodden foliage under a cloud\r\nof flies and mosquitoes. It was an involuntary tribute to the vigour\r\nof his writing. Nobody could doubt that he had wandered in Siberian\r\nforests, naked and girt with a chain. The black broadcloth coat invested\r\nhis person with a character of austere decency--something recalling a\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I want, Natalia Victorovna?\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant you to be a fanatic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fanatic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Faith alone won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice dropped to a still lower tone. He raised for a moment one\r\nthick arm; the other remained hanging down against his thigh, with the\r\nfragile silk hat at the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall tell you now something which I entreat you to ponder\r\nover carefully. Listen, we need a force that would move heaven and\r\nearth--nothing less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe profound, subterranean note of this \xe2\x80\x9cnothing less\xe2\x80\x9d made one shudder,\r\nalmost, like the deep muttering of wind in the pipes of an organ.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are we to find that force in the salon of Madame de S--? Excuse\r\nme, Peter Ivanovitch, if I permit myself to doubt it. Is not that lady a\r\nwoman of the great world, an aristocrat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrejudice!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou astonish me. And suppose she was all that!\r\nShe is also a woman of flesh and blood. There is always something to\r\nweigh down the spiritual side in all of us. But to make of it a reproach\r\nis what I did not expect from you. No! I did not expect that. One would\r\nthink you have listened to some malevolent scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard no gossip, I assure you. In our province how could we? But\r\nthe world speaks of her. What can there be in common in a lady of that\r\nsort and an obscure country girl like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a perpetual manifestation of a noble and peerless spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cHer charm--no, I shall not speak of her charm. But,\r\nof course, everybody who approaches her falls under the spell....\r\nContradictions vanish, trouble falls away from one.... Unless I\r\nam mistaken--but I never make a mistake in spiritual matters--you are\r\ntroubled in your soul, Natalia Victorovna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s clear eyes looked straight at his soft enormous face;\r\nI received the impression that behind these dark spectacles of his he\r\ncould be as impudent as he chose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the other evening walking back to town from Chateau Borel with our\r\nlatest interesting arrival from Petersburg, I could notice the powerful\r\nsoothing influence--I may say reconciling influence.... There he was,\r\nall these kilometres along the shores of the lake, silent, like a man\r\nwho has been shown the way of peace. I could feel the leaven working in\r\nhis soul, you understand. For one thing he listened to me patiently.\r\nI myself was inspired that evening by the firm and exquisite genius\r\nof Eleanor--Madame de S--, you know. It was a full moon and I could\r\nobserve his face. I cannot be deceived....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin, looking down, seemed to hesitate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I will think of what you said, Peter Ivanovitch. I shall try to\r\ncall as soon as I can leave mother for an hour or two safely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColdly as these words were said I was amazed at the concession. He\r\nsnatched her right hand with such fervour that I thought he was going\r\nto press it to his lips or his breast. But he only held it by the\r\nfinger-tips in his great paw and shook it a little up and down while he\r\ndelivered his last volley of words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t obtained your full confidence\r\nas yet, Natalia Victorovna, but that will come. All in good time. The\r\nsister of Viktor Haldin cannot be without importance.... It\xe2\x80\x99s simply\r\nimpossible. And no woman can remain sitting on the steps. Flowers,\r\ntears, applause--that has had its time; it\xe2\x80\x99s a mediaeval conception. The\r\narena, the arena itself is the place for women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe relinquished her hand with a flourish, as if giving it to her for a\r\ngift, and remained still, his head bowed in dignified submission before\r\nher femininity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe arena!... You must descend into the arena, Natalia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made one step backwards, inclined his enormous body, and was gone\r\nswiftly. The door fell to behind him. But immediately the powerful\r\nresonance of his voice was heard addressing in the ante-room the\r\nmiddle-aged servant woman who was letting him out. Whether he exhorted\r\nher too to descend into the arena I cannot tell. The thing sounded like\r\na lecture, and the slight crash of the outer door cut it short suddenly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe remained looking at each other for a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin, coming forward, put this question to me in English.\r\n\r\nI took her offered hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows. He is a revolutionary feminist, a great writer, if\r\nyou like, and--how shall I say it--the--the familiar guest of Madame de\r\nS--\xe2\x80\x98s mystic revolutionary salon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin passed her hand over her forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, he was with me for more than an hour before you came in. I\r\nwas so glad mother was lying down. She has many nights without sleep,\r\nand then sometimes in the middle of the day she gets a rest of several\r\nhours. It is sheer exhaustion--but still, I am thankful.... If it\r\nwere not for these intervals....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me and, with that extraordinary penetration which used to\r\ndisconcert me, shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. She would not go mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, by way of protest, the more shocked\r\nbecause in my heart I was far from thinking Mrs. Haldin quite sane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a fine, lucid intellect mother had,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nNathalie Haldin, with her calm, clear-eyed simplicity, which seemed to\r\nme always to have a quality of heroism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure....\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI darkened mother\xe2\x80\x99s room and came out here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted for so long to\r\nthink quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, then, without giving any sign of distress, added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ndifficult,\xe2\x80\x9d and looked at me with a strange fixity, as if watching for a\r\nsign of dissent or surprise.\r\n\r\nI gave neither. I was irresistibly impelled to say--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe visit from that gentleman has not made it any easier, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin stood before me with a peculiar expression in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to understand completely. Some guide one must have,\r\neven if one does not wholly give up the direction of one\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to\r\nhim. I am an inexperienced girl, but I am not slavish, There has been\r\ntoo much of that in Russia. Why should I not listen to him? There is no\r\nharm in having one\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts directed. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind confessing\r\nto you that I have not been completely candid with Peter Ivanovitch. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what prevented me at the moment....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked away suddenly from me to a distant part of the room; but\r\nit was only to open and shut a drawer in a bureau. She returned with\r\na piece of paper in her hand. It was thin and blackened with close\r\nhandwriting. It was obviously a letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to read you the very words,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of my poor\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s letters. He never doubted. How could he doubt? They make only\r\nsuch a small handful, these miserable oppressors, before the unanimous\r\nwill of our people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother believed in the power of a people\xe2\x80\x99s will to achieve\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was his religion,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Miss Haldin.\r\n\r\nI looked at her calm face and her animated eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course the will must be awakened, inspired, concentrated,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the true task of real agitators. One has got to give up\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s life to it. The degradation of servitude, the absolutist lies must\r\nbe uprooted and swept out. Reform is impossible. There is nothing to\r\nreform. There is no legality, there are no institutions. There are\r\nonly arbitrary decrees. There is only a handful of cruel--perhaps\r\nblind--officials against a nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter rustled slightly in her hand. I glanced down at the\r\nflimsy blackened pages whose very handwriting seemed cabalistic,\r\nincomprehensible to the experience of Western Europe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStated like this,\xe2\x80\x9d I confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe problem seems simple enough. But I\r\nfear I shall not see it solved. And if you go back to Russia I know that\r\nI shall not see you again. Yet once more I say: go back! Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nthat I am thinking of your preservation. No! I know that you will not\r\nbe returning to personal safety. But I had much rather think of you in\r\ndanger there than see you exposed to what may be met here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin, after a moment of reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve that you hate revolution; you fancy it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite honest. You\r\nbelong to a people which has made a bargain with fate and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto be rude to it. But we have made no bargain. It was never offered to\r\nus--so much liberty for so much hard cash. You shrink from the idea\r\nof revolutionary action for those you think well of as if it were\r\nsomething--how shall I say it--not quite decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think very highly of you\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I do not know it,\xe2\x80\x9d she began hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYour friendship\r\nhas been very valuable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done little else but look on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a little flushed under the eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a way of looking on which is valuable I have felt less lonely\r\nbecause of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to explain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Well, I too have felt less lonely. That\xe2\x80\x99s easy to explain,\r\nthough. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t go on much longer. The last thing I want to tell\r\nyou is this: in a real revolution--not a simple dynastic change or a\r\nmere reform of institutions--in a real revolution the best characters\r\ndo not come to the front. A violent revolution falls into the hands of\r\nnarrow-minded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at first. Afterwards\r\ncomes the turn of all the pretentious intellectual failures of the time.\r\nSuch are the chiefs and the leaders. You will notice that I have left\r\nout the mere rogues. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane,\r\nand devoted natures; the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a\r\nmovement--but it passes away from them. They are not the leaders of\r\na revolution. They are its victims: the victims of disgust, of\r\ndisenchantment--often of remorse. Hopes grotesquely betrayed, ideals\r\ncaricatured--that is the definition of revolutionary success. There have\r\nbeen in every revolution hearts broken by such successes. But enough of\r\nthat. My meaning is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be a victim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could believe all you have said I still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n protested Miss Haldin. \xe2\x80\x9cI would take liberty from any hand as a hungry\r\nman would snatch at a piece of bread. The true progress must begin\r\nafter. And for that the right men shall be found. They are already\r\namongst us. One comes upon them in their obscurity, unknown, preparing\r\nthemselves....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spread out the letter she had kept in her hand all the time, and\r\nlooking down at it--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! One comes upon such men!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, and then read out the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cUnstained, lofty, and solitary existences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFolding up the letter, while I looked at her interrogatively, she\r\nexplained--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the words which my brother applies to a young man he came to\r\nknow in St. Petersburg. An intimate friend, I suppose. It must be. His\r\nis the only name my brother mentions in all his correspondence with me.\r\nAbsolutely the only one, and--would you believe it?--the man is here. He\r\narrived recently in Geneva.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, of course; you must have seen\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was here. It\xe2\x80\x99s Peter Ivanovitch\r\nhimself who told me. You have heard him yourself mentioning a new\r\narrival from Petersburg.... Well, that is the man of \xe2\x80\x98unstained,\r\nlofty, and solitary existence.\xe2\x80\x99 My brother\xe2\x80\x99s friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompromised politically, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Yes. It must be so. Who knows! Perhaps it was this very\r\nfriendship with my brother which.... But no! It is scarcely possible.\r\nReally, I know nothing except what Peter Ivanovitch told me of him. He\r\nhas brought a letter of introduction from Father Zosim--you know, the\r\npriest-democrat; you have heard of Father Zosim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. The famous Father Zosim was staying here in Geneva for some two\r\nmonths about a year ago,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he left here he seems to have\r\ndisappeared from the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that he is at work in Russia again. Somewhere in the\r\ncentre,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin said, with animation. \xe2\x80\x9cBut please don\xe2\x80\x99t mention\r\nthat to any one--don\xe2\x80\x99t let it slip from you, because if it got into the\r\npapers it would be dangerous for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are anxious, of course, to meet that friend of your brother?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin put the letter into her pocket. Her eyes looked beyond my\r\nshoulder at the door of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot here,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cNot for the first time, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of silence I said good-bye, but Miss Haldin followed me\r\ninto the ante-room, closing the door behind us carefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you guess where I mean to go tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made up your mind to call on Madame de S--.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am going to the Chateau Borel. I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you expect to hear there?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nI wondered if she were not deluding herself with some impossible hope.\r\nIt was not that, however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think--such a friend. The only man mentioned in his letters. He\r\nwould have something to give me, if nothing more than a few poor words.\r\nIt may be something said and thought in those last days. Would you want\r\nme to turn my back on what is left of my poor brother--a friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand your pious curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Unstained, lofty, and solitary existences,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are! There are! Well, let me question one of them about the loved\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know, though, that you will meet him there? Is he staying in\r\nthe Chateau as a guest--do you suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t really tell,\xe2\x80\x9d she confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe brought a written introduction\r\nfrom Father Zosim--who, it seems, is a friend of Madame de S-- too. She\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be such a worthless woman after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were all sorts of rumours afloat about Father Zosim himself,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalumny is a weapon of our government too. It\xe2\x80\x99s well known. Oh yes! It\r\nis a fact that Father Zosim had the protection of the Governor-General\r\nof a certain province. We talked on the subject with my brother two\r\nyears ago, I remember. But his work was good. And now he is proscribed.\r\nWhat better proof can one require. But no matter what that priest was\r\nor is. All that cannot affect my brother\xe2\x80\x99s friend. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t meet him\r\nthere I shall ask these people for his address. And, of course, mother\r\nmust see him too, later on. There is no guessing what he may have to\r\ntell us. It would be a mercy if mamma could be soothed. You know what\r\nshe imagines. Some explanation perhaps may be found, or--or even made\r\nup, perhaps. It would be no sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be no sin. It may be a mistake, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want her only to recover some of her old spirit. While she is like\r\nthis I cannot think of anything calmly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to invent some sort of pious fraud for your mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy fraud? Such a friend is sure to know something of my brother in\r\nthese last days. He could tell us.... There is something in the\r\nfacts which will not let me rest. I am certain he meant to join us\r\nabroad--that he had some plans--some great patriotic action in view;\r\nnot only for himself, but for both of us. I trusted in that. I looked\r\nforward to the time! Oh! with such hope and impatience. I could have\r\nhelped. And now suddenly this appearance of recklessness--as if he had\r\nnot cared....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for a time, then obstinately she concluded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThinking it over, later on, while I walked slowly away from the\r\nBoulevard des Philosophes, I asked myself critically, what precisely was\r\nit that she wanted to know? What I had heard of her history was enough\r\nto give me a clue. In the educational establishment for girls where Miss\r\nHaldin finished her studies she was looked upon rather unfavourably.\r\nShe was suspected of holding independent views on matters settled by\r\nofficial teaching. Afterwards, when the two ladies returned to their\r\ncountry place, both mother and daughter, by speaking their minds openly\r\non public events, had earned for themselves a reputation of liberalism.\r\nThe three-horse trap of the district police-captain began to be seen\r\nfrequently in their village. \xe2\x80\x9cI must keep an eye on the peasants\xe2\x80\x9d--so he\r\nexplained his visits up at the house. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo lonely ladies must be looked\r\nafter a little.\xe2\x80\x9d He would inspect the walls as though he wanted to\r\npierce them with his eyes, peer at the photographs, turn over the books\r\nin the drawing-room negligently, and after the usual refreshments,\r\nwould depart. But the old priest of the village came one evening in the\r\ngreatest distress and agitation, to confess that he--the priest--had\r\nbeen ordered to watch and ascertain in other ways too (such as using his\r\nspiritual power with the servants) all that was going on in the house,\r\nand especially in respect of the visitors these ladies received, who\r\nthey were, the length of their stay, whether any of them were strangers\r\nto that part of the country, and so on. The poor, simple old man was in\r\nan agony of humiliation and terror. \xe2\x80\x9cI came to warn you. Be cautious in\r\nyour conduct, for the love of God. I am burning with shame, but there is\r\nno getting out from under the net. I shall have to tell them what I\r\nsee, because if I did not there is my deacon. He would make the worst\r\nof things to curry favour. And then my son-in-law, the husband of my\r\nParasha, who is a writer in the Government Domain office; they would\r\nsoon kick him out--and maybe send him away somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man\r\nlamented the necessities of the times--\xe2\x80\x9cwhen people do not agree\r\nsomehow\xe2\x80\x9d and wiped his eyes. He did not wish to spend the evening of his\r\ndays with a shaven head in the penitent\xe2\x80\x99s cell of some monastery--\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nsubjected to all the severities of ecclesiastical discipline; for\r\nthey would show no mercy to an old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned. He became almost\r\nhysterical, and the two ladies, full of commiseration, soothed him the\r\nbest they could before they let him go back to his cottage. But, as a\r\nmatter of fact, they had very few visitors. The neighbours--some of them\r\nold friends--began to keep away; a few from timidity, others with marked\r\ndisdain, being grand people that came only for the summer--Miss Haldin\r\nexplained to me--aristocrats, reactionaries. It was a solitary existence\r\nfor a young girl. Her relations with her mother were of the tenderest\r\nand most open kind; but Mrs. Haldin had seen the experiences of her\r\nown generation, its sufferings, its deceptions, its apostasies too. Her\r\naffection for her children was expressed by the suppression of all signs\r\nof anxiety. She maintained a heroic reserve. To Nathalie Haldin, her\r\nbrother with his Petersburg existence, not enigmatical in the least\r\n(there could be no doubt of what he felt or thought) but conducted a\r\nlittle mysteriously, was the only visible representative of a proscribed\r\nliberty. All the significance of freedom, its indefinite promises, lived\r\nin their long discussions, which breathed the loftiest hope of action\r\nand faith in success. Then, suddenly, the action, the hopes, came to\r\nan end with the details ferreted out by the English journalist. The\r\nconcrete fact, the fact of his death remained! but it remained obscure\r\nin its deeper causes. She felt herself abandoned without explanation.\r\nBut she did not suspect him. What she wanted was to learn almost at any\r\ncost how she could remain faithful to his departed spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral days elapsed before I met Nathalie Haldin again. I was crossing\r\nthe place in front of the theatre when I made out her shapely figure\r\nin the very act of turning between the gate pillars of the unattractive\r\npublic promenade of the Bastions. She walked away from me, but I knew\r\nwe should meet as she returned down the main alley--unless, indeed, she\r\nwere going home. In that case, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should have called on her\r\nyet. My desire to keep her away from these people was as strong as ever,\r\nbut I had no illusions as to my power. I was but a Westerner, and it was\r\nclear that Miss Haldin would not, could not listen to my wisdom; and as\r\nto my desire of listening to her voice, it were better, I thought, not\r\nto indulge overmuch in that pleasure. No, I should not have gone to the\r\nBoulevard des Philosophes; but when at about the middle of the principal\r\nalley I saw Miss Haldin coming towards me, I was too curious, and too\r\nhonest, perhaps, to run away.\r\n\r\nThere was something of the spring harshness in the air. The blue sky was\r\nhard, but the young leaves clung like soft mist about the uninteresting\r\nrange of trees; and the clear sun put little points of gold into the\r\ngrey of Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s frank eyes, turned to me with a friendly greeting.\r\n\r\nI inquired after the health of her mother.\r\n\r\nShe had a slight movement of the shoulders and a little sad sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, you see, I did come out for a walk...for exercise, as you\r\nEnglish say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI smiled approvingly, and she added an unexpected remark--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a glorious day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice, slightly harsh, but fascinating with its masculine and\r\nbird-like quality, had the accent of spontaneous conviction. I was glad\r\nof it. It was as though she had become aware of her youth--for there was\r\nbut little of spring-like glory in the rectangular railed space of\r\ngrass and trees, framed visibly by the orderly roof-slopes of that town,\r\ncomely without grace, and hospitable without sympathy. In the very air\r\nthrough which she moved there was but little warmth; and the sky, the\r\nsky of a land without horizons, swept and washed clean by the April\r\nshowers, extended a cold cruel blue, without elevation, narrowed\r\nsuddenly by the ugly, dark wall of the Jura where, here and there,\r\nlingered yet a few miserable trails and patches of snow. All the glory\r\nof the season must have been within herself--and I was glad this feeling\r\nhad come into her life, if only for a little time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am pleased to hear you say these words.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave me a quick look.\r\nQuick, not stealthy. If there was one thing of which she was absolutely\r\nincapable, it was stealthiness, Her sincerity was expressed in the very\r\nrhythm of her walk. It was I who was looking at her covertly--if I may\r\nsay so. I knew where she had been, but I did not know what she had seen\r\nand heard in that nest of aristocratic conspiracies. I use the word\r\naristocratic, for want of a better term. The Chateau Borel, embowered\r\nin the trees and thickets of its neglected grounds, had its fame in our\r\nday, like the residence of that other dangerous and exiled woman, Madame\r\nde Stael, in the Napoleonic era. Only the Napoleonic despotism, the\r\nbooted heir of the Revolution, which counted that intellectual woman for\r\nan enemy worthy to be watched, was something quite unlike the autocracy\r\nin mystic vestments, engendered by the slavery of a Tartar conquest.\r\nAnd Madame de S-- was very far from resembling the gifted author of\r\n_Corinne_. She made a great noise about being persecuted. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow if she were regarded in certain circles as dangerous. As to being\r\nwatched, I imagine that the Chateau Borel could be subjected only to a\r\nmost distant observation. It was in its exclusiveness an ideal abode for\r\nhatching superior plots--whether serious or futile. But all this did not\r\ninterest me. I wanted to know the effect its extraordinary inhabitants\r\nand its special atmosphere had produced on a girl like Miss Haldin, so\r\ntrue, so honest, but so dangerously inexperienced! Her unconsciously\r\nlofty ignorance of the baser instincts of mankind left her disarmed\r\nbefore her own impulses. And there was also that friend of her brother,\r\nthe significant new arrival from Russia.... I wondered whether she\r\nhad managed to meet him.\r\n\r\nWe walked for some time, slowly and in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d I attacked her suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t intend telling me\r\nanything, you must say so distinctly, and then, of course, it shall be\r\nfinal. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t play at delicacy. I ask you point-blank for all the\r\ndetails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly at my threatening tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are as curious as a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I am only an anxious old man,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied earnestly.\r\n\r\nShe rested her glance on me as if to ascertain the degree of my anxiety\r\nor the number of my years. My physiognomy has never been expressive,\r\nI believe, and as to my years I am not ancient enough as yet to be\r\nstrikingly decrepit. I have no long beard like the good hermit of a\r\nromantic ballad; my footsteps are not tottering, my aspect not that of\r\na slow, venerable sage. Those picturesque advantages are not mine. I am\r\nold, alas, in a brisk, commonplace way. And it seemed to me as though\r\nthere were some pity for me in Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s prolonged glance. She\r\nstepped out a little quicker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask for all the details. Let me see. I ought to remember them. It\r\nwas novel enough for a--a village girl like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of silence she began by saying that the Chateau Borel was\r\nalmost as neglected inside as outside. It was nothing to wonder at, a\r\nHamburg banker, I believe, retired from business, had it built to cheer\r\nhis remaining days by the view of that lake whose precise, orderly,\r\nand well-to-do beauty must have been attractive to the unromantic\r\nimagination of a business man. But he died soon. His wife departed\r\ntoo (but only to Italy), and this house of moneyed ease, presumably\r\nunsaleable, had stood empty for several years. One went to it up a\r\ngravel drive, round a large, coarse grass-plot, with plenty of time to\r\nobserve the degradation of its stuccoed front. Miss Haldin said that the\r\nimpression was unpleasant. It grew more depressing as one came nearer.\r\n\r\nShe observed green stains of moss on the steps of the terrace. The front\r\ndoor stood wide open. There was no one about. She found herself in a\r\nwide, lofty, and absolutely empty hall, with a good many doors. These\r\ndoors were all shut. A broad, bare stone staircase faced her, and\r\nthe effect of the whole was of an untenanted house. She stood still,\r\ndisconcerted by the solitude, but after a while she became aware of a\r\nvoice speaking continuously somewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were probably being observed all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nmust have been eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how that could be,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen even a\r\nbird in the grounds. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember hearing a single twitter in the\r\ntrees. The whole place appeared utterly deserted except for the voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not make out the language--Russian, French, or German. No one\r\nseemed to answer it. It was as though the voice had been left behind by\r\nthe departed inhabitants to talk to the bare walls. It went on volubly,\r\nwith a pause now and then. It was lonely and sad. The time seemed very\r\nlong to Miss Haldin. An invincible repugnance prevented her from opening\r\none of the doors in the hall. It was so hopeless. No one would come, the\r\nvoice would never stop. She confessed to me that she had to resist an\r\nimpulse to turn round and go away unseen, as she had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? You had that impulse?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, full of regret. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity\r\nyou did not obey it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange memory it would have been for one. Those deserted\r\ngrounds, that empty hall, that impersonal, voluble voice, and--nobody,\r\nnothing, not a soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe memory would have been unique and harmless. But she was not a girl\r\nto run away from an intimidating impression of solitude and mystery.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not run away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI stayed where I was--and I did see\r\na soul. Such a strange soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she was gazing up the broad staircase, and had concluded that\r\nthe voice came from somewhere above, a rustle of dress attracted her\r\nattention. She looked down and saw a woman crossing the hall, having\r\nissued apparently through one of the many doors. Her face was averted,\r\nso that at first she was not aware of Miss Haldin.\r\n\r\nOn turning her head and seeing a stranger, she appeared very much\r\nstartled. From her slender figure Miss Haldin had taken her for a young\r\ngirl; but if her face was almost childishly round, it was also sallow\r\nand wrinkled, with dark rings under the eyes. A thick crop of dusty\r\nbrown hair was parted boyishly on the side with a lateral wave above the\r\ndry, furrowed forehead. After a moment of dumb blinking, she suddenly\r\nsquatted down on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by squatted down?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a\r\nvery strange detail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin explained the reason. This person when first seen was\r\ncarrying a small bowl in her hand. She had squatted down to put it\r\non the floor for the benefit of a large cat, which appeared then from\r\nbehind her skirts, and hid its head into the bowl greedily. She got up,\r\nand approaching Miss Haldin asked with nervous bluntness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin mentioned her name and also the name of Peter Ivanovitch.\r\nThe girlish, elderly woman nodded and puckered her face into a momentary\r\nexpression of sympathy. Her black silk blouse was old and even frayed\r\nin places; the black serge skirt was short and shabby. She continued to\r\nblink at close quarters, and her eyelashes and eyebrows seemed shabby\r\ntoo. Miss Haldin, speaking gently to her, as if to an unhappy and\r\nsensitive person, explained how it was that her visit could not be an\r\naltogether unexpected event to Madame de S--.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Peter Ivanovitch brought you an invitation. How was I to know? A\r\n_dame de compangnie_ is not consulted, as you may imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shabby woman laughed a little. Her teeth, splendidly white and\r\nadmirably even, looked absurdly out of place, like a string of pearls on\r\nthe neck of a ragged tramp. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch is the greatest genius of\r\nthe century perhaps, but he is the most inconsiderate man living. So if\r\nyou have an appointment with him you must not be surprised to hear that\r\nhe is not here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin explained that she had no appointment with Peter Ivanovitch.\r\nShe became interested at once in that bizarre person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he put himself out for you or any one else? Oh! these\r\ngeniuses. If you only knew! Yes! And their books--I mean, of course, the\r\nbooks that the world admires, the inspired books. But you have not been\r\nbehind the scenes. Wait till you have to sit at a table for a half a day\r\nwith a pen in your hand. He can walk up and down his rooms for hours and\r\nhours. I used to get so stiff and numb that I was afraid I would lose my\r\nbalance and fall off the chair all at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her hands folded in front of her, and her eyes, fixed on Miss\r\nHaldin\xe2\x80\x99s face, betrayed no animation whatever. Miss Haldin, gathering\r\nthat the lady who called herself a _dame de compangnie_ was proud of\r\nhaving acted as secretary to Peter Ivanovitch, made an amiable remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not imagine a more trying experience,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the lady.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an Anglo-American journalist interviewing Madame de S-- now,\r\nor I would take you up,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued in a changed tone and glancing\r\ntowards the staircase. \xe2\x80\x9cI act as master of ceremonies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Madame de S-- could not bear Swiss servants about\r\nher person; and, indeed, servants would not stay for very long in the\r\nChateau Borel. There were always difficulties. Miss Haldin had already\r\nnoticed that the hall was like a dusty barn of marble and stucco with\r\ncobwebs in the corners and faint tracks of mud on the black and white\r\ntessellated floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI look also after this animal,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the _dame de compagnie_,\r\nkeeping her hands folded quietly in front of her; and she bent her\r\nworn gaze upon the cat. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a bit. Animals have their rights;\r\nthough, strictly speaking, I see no reason why they should not suffer as\r\nwell as human beings. Do you? But of course they never suffer so much.\r\nThat is impossible. Only, in their case it is more pitiful because they\r\ncannot make a revolution. I used to be a Republican. I suppose you are a\r\nRepublican?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin confessed to me that she did not know what to say. But she\r\nnodded slightly, and asked in her turn--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you no longer a Republican?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter taking down Peter Ivanovitch from dictation for two years, it is\r\ndifficult for me to be anything. First of all, you have to sit perfectly\r\nmotionless. The slightest movement you make puts to flight the ideas of\r\nPeter Ivanovitch. You hardly dare to breathe. And as to coughing--God\r\nforbid! Peter Ivanovitch changed the position of the table to the wall\r\nbecause at first I could not help raising my eyes to look out of the\r\nwindow, while waiting for him to go on with his dictation. That was not\r\nallowed. He said I stared so stupidly. I was likewise not permitted to\r\nlook at him over my shoulder. Instantly Peter Ivanovitch stamped his\r\nfoot, and would roar, \xe2\x80\x98Look down on the paper!\xe2\x80\x99 It seems my expression,\r\nmy face, put him off. Well, I know that I am not beautiful, and that my\r\nexpression is not hopeful either. He said that my air of unintelligent\r\nexpectation irritated him. These are his own words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin was shocked, but admitted to me that she was not altogether\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that Peter Ivanovitch could treat any woman so rudely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she cried.\r\n\r\nThe _dame de compagnie_ nodded several times with an air of discretion,\r\nthen assured Miss Haldin that she did not mind in the least. The trying\r\npart of it was to have the secret of the composition laid bare before\r\nher; to see the great author of the revolutionary gospels grope for\r\nwords as if he were in the dark as to what he meant to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite willing to be the blind instrument of higher ends. To\r\ngive one\xe2\x80\x99s life for the cause is nothing. But to have one\xe2\x80\x99s illusions\r\ndestroyed--that is really almost more than one can bear. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexaggerate,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to freeze my very beliefs in\r\nme--the more so that when we worked in winter Peter Ivanovitch, walking\r\nup and down the room, required no artificial heat to keep himself warm.\r\nEven when we move to the South of France there are bitterly cold days,\r\nespecially when you have to sit still for six hours at a stretch. The\r\nwalls of these villas on the Riviera are so flimsy. Peter Ivanovitch did\r\nnot seem to be aware of anything. It is true that I kept down my shivers\r\nfrom fear of putting him out. I used to set my teeth till my jaws felt\r\nabsolutely locked. In the moments when Peter Ivanovitch interrupted his\r\ndictation, and sometimes these intervals were very long--often twenty\r\nminutes, no less, while he walked to and fro behind my back muttering\r\nto himself--I felt I was dying by inches, I assure you. Perhaps if I had\r\nlet my teeth rattle Peter Ivanovitch might have noticed my distress, but\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would have had any practical effect. She\xe2\x80\x99s very miserly\r\nin such matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe _dame de compagnie_ glanced up the staircase. The big cat had\r\nfinished the milk and was rubbing its whiskered cheek sinuously against\r\nher skirt. She dived to snatch it up from the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiserliness is rather a quality than otherwise, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, holding the cat in her folded arms. \xe2\x80\x9cWith us it is misers who\r\ncan spare money for worthy objects--not the so-called generous natures.\r\nBut pray don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am a sybarite. My father was a clerk in the\r\nMinistry of Finances with no position at all. You may guess by this that\r\nour home was far from luxurious, though of course we did not actually\r\nsuffer from cold. I ran away from my parents, you know, directly I began\r\nto think by myself. It is not very easy, such thinking. One has got to\r\nbe put in the way of it, awakened to the truth. I am indebted for my\r\nsalvation to an old apple-woman, who had her stall under the gateway\r\nof the house we lived in. She had a kind wrinkled face, and the most\r\nfriendly voice imaginable. One day, casually, we began to talk about a\r\nchild, a ragged little girl we had seen begging from men in the streets\r\nat dusk; and from one thing to another my eyes began to open gradually\r\nto the horrors from which innocent people are made to suffer in\r\nthis world, only in order that governments might exist. After I once\r\nunderstood the crime of the upper classes, I could not go on living with\r\nmy parents. Not a single charitable word was to be heard in our home\r\nfrom year\xe2\x80\x99s end to year\xe2\x80\x99s end; there was nothing but the talk of vile\r\noffice intrigues, and of promotion and of salaries, and of courting the\r\nfavour of the chiefs. The mere idea of marrying one day such another man\r\nas my father made me shudder. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there was anyone wanting\r\nto marry me. There was not the slightest prospect of anything of the\r\nkind. But was it not sin enough to live on a Government salary while\r\nhalf Russia was dying of hunger? The Ministry of Finances! What a\r\ngrotesque horror it is! What does the starving, ignorant people want\r\nwith a Ministry of Finances? I kissed my old folks on both cheeks, and\r\nwent away from them to live in cellars, with the proletariat. I tried\r\nto make myself useful to the utterly hopeless. I suppose you understand\r\nwhat I mean? I mean the people who have nowhere to go and nothing to\r\nlook forward to in this life. Do you understand how frightful that\r\nis--nothing to look forward to! Sometimes I think that it is only in\r\nRussia that there are such people and such a depth of misery can be\r\nreached. Well, I plunged into it, and--do you know--there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nthat one can do in there. No, indeed--at least as long as there are\r\nMinistries of Finances and such like grotesque horrors to stand in the\r\nway. I suppose I would have gone mad there just trying to fight the\r\nvermin, if it had not been for a man. It was my old friend and\r\nteacher, the poor saintly apple-woman, who discovered him for me, quite\r\naccidentally. She came to fetch me late one evening in her quiet way. I\r\nfollowed her where she would lead; that part of my life was in her hands\r\naltogether, and without her my spirit would have perished miserably. The\r\nman was a young workman, a lithographer by trade, and he had got\r\ninto trouble in connexion with that affair of temperance tracts--you\r\nremember. There was a lot of people put in prison for that. The Ministry\r\nof Finances again! What would become of it if the poor folk ceased\r\nmaking beasts of themselves with drink? Upon my word, I would think that\r\nfinances and all the rest of it are an invention of the devil; only that\r\na belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone\r\nare quite capable of every wickedness. Finances indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHatred and contempt hissed in her utterance of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfinances,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nat the very moment she gently stroked the cat reposing in her arms.\r\nShe even raised them slightly, and inclining her head rubbed her cheek\r\nagainst the fur of the animal, which received this caress with the\r\ncomplete detachment so characteristic of its kind. Then looking at Miss\r\nHaldin she excused herself once more for not taking her upstairs to\r\nMadame S-- The interview could not be interrupted. Presently the\r\njournalist would be seen coming down the stairs. The best thing was to\r\nremain in the hall; and besides, all these rooms (she glanced all\r\nround at the many doors), all these rooms on the ground floor were\r\nunfurnished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPositively there is no chair down here to offer you,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you prefer your own thoughts to my chatter, I will sit down on\r\nthe bottom step here and keep silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin hastened to assure her that, on the contrary, she was very\r\nmuch interested in the story of the journeyman lithographer. He was a\r\nrevolutionist, of course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA martyr, a simple man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the _dame de compangnie_, with a faint\r\nsigh, and gazing through the open front door dreamily. She turned her\r\nmisty brown eyes on Miss Haldin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lived with him for four months. It was like a nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Miss Haldin looked at her inquisitively she began to describe the\r\nemaciated face of the man, his fleshless limbs, his destitution.\r\nThe room into which the apple-woman had led her was a tiny garret, a\r\nmiserable den under the roof of a sordid house. The plaster fallen off\r\nthe walls covered the floor, and when the door was opened a horrible\r\ntapestry of black cobwebs waved in the draught. He had been liberated a\r\nfew days before--flung out of prison into the streets. And Miss Haldin\r\nseemed to see for the first time, a name and a face upon the body of\r\nthat suffering people whose hard fate had been the subject of so many\r\nconversations, between her and her brother, in the garden of their\r\ncountry house.\r\n\r\nHe had been arrested with scores and scores of other people in that\r\naffair of the lithographed temperance tracts. Unluckily, having got hold\r\nof a great many suspected persons, the police thought they could extract\r\nfrom some of them other information relating to the revolutionist\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey beat him so cruelly in the course of investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the\r\n_dame de compagnie_, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they injured him internally. When they had\r\ndone with him he was doomed. He could do nothing for himself. I beheld\r\nhim lying on a wooden bedstead without any bedding, with his head on a\r\nbundle of dirty rags, lent to him out of charity by an old rag-picker,\r\nwho happened to live in the basement of the house. There he was,\r\nuncovered, burning with fever, and there was not even a jug in the\r\nroom for the water to quench his thirst with. There was nothing\r\nwhatever--just that bedstead and the bare floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there no one in all that great town amongst the liberals and\r\nrevolutionaries, to extend a helping hand to a brother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss\r\nHaldin indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But you do not know the most terrible part of that man\xe2\x80\x99s misery.\r\nListen. It seems that they ill-used him so atrociously that, at last,\r\nhis firmness gave way, and he did let out some information. Poor soul,\r\nthe flesh is weak, you know. What it was he did not tell me. There was\r\na crushed spirit in that mangled body. Nothing I found to say could make\r\nhim whole. When they let him out, he crept into that hole, and bore his\r\nremorse stoically. He would not go near anyone he knew. I would have\r\nsought assistance for him, but, indeed, where could I have gone looking\r\nfor it? Where was I to look for anyone who had anything to spare or any\r\npower to help? The people living round us were all starving and drunken.\r\nThey were the victims of the Ministry of Finances. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me how we\r\nlived. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. It was like a miracle of wretchedness. I had\r\nnothing to sell, and I assure you my clothes were in such a state that\r\nit was impossible for me to go out in the daytime. I was indecent. I had\r\nto wait till it was dark before I ventured into the streets to beg for a\r\ncrust of bread, or whatever I could get, to keep him and me alive. Often\r\nI got nothing, and then I would crawl back and lie on the floor by the\r\nside of his couch. Oh yes, I can sleep quite soundly on bare boards.\r\nThat is nothing, and I am only mentioning it to you so that you should\r\nnot think I am a sybarite. It was infinitely less killing than the task\r\nof sitting for hours at a table in a cold study to take the books of\r\nPeter Ivanovitch from dictation. But you shall see yourself what that is\r\nlike, so I needn\xe2\x80\x99t say any more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is by no means certain that I will ever take Peter Ivanovitch from\r\ndictation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other incredulously. \xe2\x80\x9cNot certain? You mean to say that\r\nyou have not made up your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Haldin assured her that there never had been any question of\r\nthat between her and Peter Ivanovitch, the woman with the cat compressed\r\nher lips tightly for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you will find yourself settled at the table before you know that\r\nyou have made up your mind. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make a mistake, it is disenchanting\r\nto hear Peter Ivanovitch dictate, but at the same time there is a\r\nfascination about it. He is a man of genius. Your face is certain not to\r\nirritate him; you may perhaps even help his inspiration, make it easier\r\nfor him to deliver his message. As I look at you, I feel certain that\r\nyou are the kind of woman who is not likely to check the flow of his\r\ninspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin thought it useless to protest against all these assumptions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this man--this workman did he die under your care?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after\r\na short silence.\r\n\r\nThe _dame de compagnie_, listening up the stairs where now two voices\r\nwere alternating with some animation, made no answer for a time. When\r\nthe loud sounds of the discussion had sunk into an almost inaudible\r\nmurmur, she turned to Miss Haldin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he died, but not, literally speaking, in my arms, as you might\r\nsuppose. As a matter of fact, I was asleep when he breathed his last.\r\nSo even now I cannot say I have seen anybody die. A few days before\r\nthe end, some young men found us out in our extremity. They were\r\nrevolutionists, as you might guess. He ought to have trusted in his\r\npolitical friends when he came out of prison. He had been liked and\r\nrespected before, and nobody would have dreamed of reproaching him with\r\nhis indiscretion before the police. Everybody knows how they go to work,\r\nand the strongest man has his moments of weakness before pain. Why, even\r\nhunger alone is enough to give one queer ideas as to what may be done. A\r\ndoctor came, our lot was alleviated as far as physical comforts go, but\r\notherwise he could not be consoled--poor man. I assure you, Miss Haldin,\r\nthat he was very lovable, but I had not the strength to weep. I was\r\nnearly dead myself. But there were kind hearts to take care of me.\r\nA dress was found to clothe my nakedness. I tell you, I was not\r\ndecent--and after a time the revolutionists placed me with a Jewish\r\nfamily going abroad, as governess. Of course I could teach the children,\r\nI finished the sixth class of the Lyceum; but the real object was,\r\nthat I should carry some important papers across the frontier. I was\r\nentrusted with a packet which I carried next my heart. The gendarmes\r\nat the station did not suspect the governess of a Jewish family, busy\r\nlooking after three children. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose those Hebrews knew what I\r\nhad on me, for I had been introduced to them in a very roundabout way by\r\npersons who did not belong to the revolutionary movement, and naturally\r\nI had been instructed to accept a very small salary. When we reached\r\nGermany I left that family and delivered my papers to a revolutionist\r\nin Stuttgart; after this I was employed in various ways. But you do not\r\nwant to hear all that. I have never felt that I was very useful, but I\r\nlive in hopes of seeing all the Ministries destroyed, finances and\r\nall. The greatest joy of my life has been to hear what your brother has\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe directed her round eyes again to the sunshine outside, while the\r\ncat reposed within her folded arms in lordly beatitude and sphinx-like\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! I rejoiced,\xe2\x80\x9d she began again. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me there is a heroic ring about\r\nthe very name of Haldin. They must have been trembling with fear in\r\ntheir Ministries--all those men with fiendish hearts. Here I stand\r\ntalking to you, and when I think of all the cruelties, oppressions,\r\nand injustices that are going on at this very moment, my head begins to\r\nswim. I have looked closely at what would seem inconceivable if one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown eyes had not to be trusted. I have looked at things that made me\r\nhate myself for my helplessness. I hated my hands that had no power,\r\nmy voice that could not be heard, my very mind that would not become\r\nunhinged. Ah! I have seen things. And you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin was moved. She shook her head slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have seen nothing for myself as yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\nalways lived in the country. It was my brother\xe2\x80\x99s wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a curious meeting--this--between you and me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in chance, Miss Haldin? How could I have expected\r\nto see you, his sister, with my own eyes? Do you know that when the news\r\ncame the revolutionaries here were as much surprised as pleased, every\r\nbit? No one seemed to know anything about your brother. Peter Ivanovitch\r\nhimself had not foreseen that such a blow was going to be struck. I\r\nsuppose your brother was simply inspired. I myself think that such\r\ndeeds should be done by inspiration. It is a great privilege to have the\r\ninspiration and the opportunity. Did he resemble you at all? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nrejoice, Miss Haldin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not expect too much from me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin, repressing\r\nan inclination to cry which came over her suddenly. She succeeded, then\r\nadded calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a heroic person!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done such a thing yourself perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I must not even ask myself till I have lived a little\r\nlonger, seen more....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other moved her head appreciatively. The purring of the cat had\r\na loud complacency in the empty hall. No sound of voices came from\r\nupstairs. Miss Haldin broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it precisely that you heard people say about my brother? You\r\nsaid that they were surprised. Yes, I supposed they were. Did it not\r\nseem strange to them that my brother should have failed to save himself\r\nafter the most difficult part--that is, getting away from the spot--was\r\nover? Conspirators should understand these things well. There are\r\nreasons why I am very anxious to know how it is he failed to escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe _dame de compagnie_ had advanced to the open hall-door. She glanced\r\nrapidly over her shoulder at Miss Haldin, who remained within the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFailed to escape,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated absently. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he make the sacrifice\r\nof his life? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he just simply inspired? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it an act of\r\nabnegation? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you certain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I am certain of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin, \xe2\x80\x9cis that it was not an act\r\nof despair. Have you not heard some opinion expressed here upon his\r\nmiserable capture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe _dame de compagnie_ mused for a while in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I hear? Of course, everything is discussed here. Has not all the\r\nworld been speaking about your brother? For my part, the mere mention\r\nof his achievement plunges me into an envious ecstasy. Why should a man\r\ncertain of immortality think of his life at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her back turned to Miss Haldin. Upstairs from behind a great\r\ndingy white and gold door, visible behind the balustrade of the first\r\nfloor landing, a deep voice began to drone formally, as if reading over\r\nnotes or something of the sort. It paused frequently, and then ceased\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can stay any longer now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin. \xe2\x80\x9cI may\r\nreturn another day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited for the _dame de compagnie_ to make room for her exit; but\r\nthe woman appeared lost in the contemplation of sunshine and shadows,\r\nsharing between themselves the stillness of the deserted grounds. She\r\nconcealed the view of the drive from Miss Haldin. Suddenly she said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be necessary; here is Peter Ivanovitch himself coming up.\r\nBut he is not alone. He is seldom alone now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing that Peter Ivanovitch was approaching, Miss Haldin was not so\r\npleased as she might have been expected to be. Somehow she had lost\r\nthe desire to see either the heroic captive or Madame de S--, and the\r\nreason of that shrinking which came upon her at the very last minute is\r\naccounted for by the feeling that those two people had not been treating\r\nthe woman with the cat kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you please let me pass?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin at last, touching\r\nlightly the shoulder of the _dame de compagnie_.\r\n\r\nBut the other, pressing the cat to her breast, did not budge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know who is with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without even looking back.\r\n\r\nMore unaccountably than ever Miss Haldin felt a strong impulse to leave\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de S-- may be engaged for some time yet, and what I have got to\r\nsay to Peter Ivanovitch is just a simple question which I might put to\r\nhim when I meet him in the grounds on my way down. I really think I\r\nmust go. I have been some time here, and I am anxious to get back to my\r\nmother. Will you let me pass, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe _dame de compagnie_ turned her head at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never supposed that you really wanted to see Madame de S--,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, with unexpected insight. \xe2\x80\x9cNot for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d There was something\r\nconfidential and mysterious in her tone. She passed through the door,\r\nwith Miss Haldin following her, on to the terrace, and they descended\r\nside by side the moss-grown stone steps. There was no one to be seen on\r\nthe part of the drive visible from the front of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are hidden by the trees over there,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\nacquaintance, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you shall see them directly. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who that\r\nyoung man is to whom Peter Ivanovitch has taken such a fancy. He must\r\nbe one of us, or he would not be admitted here when the others come.\r\nYou know what I mean by the others. But I must say that he is not at\r\nall mystically inclined. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I have made him out yet.\r\nNaturally I am never for very long in the drawing-room. There is\r\nalways something to do for me, though the establishment here is not so\r\nextensive as the villa on the Riviera. But still there are plenty of\r\nopportunities for me to make myself useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the left, passing by the ivy-grown end of the stables, appeared Peter\r\nIvanovitch and his companion. They walked very slowly, conversing with\r\nsome animation. They stopped for a moment, and Peter Ivanovitch was seen\r\nto gesticulate, while the young man listened motionless, with his arms\r\nhanging down and his head bowed a little. He was dressed in a dark brown\r\nsuit and a black hat. The round eyes of the _dame de compagnie_ remained\r\nfixed on the two figures, which had resumed their leisurely approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn extremely polite young man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see what a bow he\r\nwill make; and it won\xe2\x80\x99t altogether be so exceptional either. He bows in\r\nthe same way when he meets me alone in the hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved on a few steps, with Miss Haldin by her side, and things\r\nhappened just as she had foretold. The young man took off his hat, bowed\r\nand fell back, while Peter Ivanovitch advanced quicker, his black, thick\r\narms extended heartily, and seized hold of both Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\r\nshook them, and peered at her through his dark glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s right!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed twice, approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so\r\nyou have been looked after by....\xe2\x80\x9d He frowned slightly at the\r\n_dame de compagnie_, who was still nursing the cat. \xe2\x80\x9cI conclude\r\nEleanor--Madame de S-- is engaged. I know she expected somebody to-day.\r\nSo the newspaper man did turn up, eh? She is engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor all answer the _dame de compagnie_ turned away her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very unfortunate--very unfortunate indeed. I very much regret\r\nthat you should have been....\xe2\x80\x9d He lowered suddenly his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhat is it--surely you are not departing, Natalia Victorovna? You got\r\nbored waiting, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin protested. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I have been here some\r\ntime, and I am anxious to get back to my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time seemed long, eh? I am afraid our worthy friend here\xe2\x80\x9d (Peter\r\nIvanovitch suddenly jerked his head sideways towards his right shoulder\r\nand jerked it up again),--\xe2\x80\x9cour worthy friend here has not the art of\r\nshortening the moments of waiting. No, distinctly she has not the art;\r\nand in that respect good intentions alone count for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe _dame de compagnie_ dropped her arms, and the cat found itself\r\nsuddenly on the ground. It remained quite still after alighting, one\r\nhind leg stretched backwards. Miss Haldin was extremely indignant on\r\nbehalf of the lady companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Peter Ivanovitch, that the moments I have passed in\r\nthe hall of this house have been not a little interesting, and very\r\ninstructive too. They are memorable. I do not regret the waiting, but\r\nI see that the object of my call here can be attained without taking up\r\nMadame de S--\xe2\x80\x98s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point I interrupted Miss Haldin. The above relation is founded\r\non her narrative, which I have not so much dramatized as might be\r\nsupposed. She had rendered, with extraordinary feeling and animation,\r\nthe very accent almost of the disciple of the old apple-woman, the\r\nirreconcilable hater of Ministries, the voluntary servant of the poor.\r\nMiss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s true and delicate humanity had been extremely shocked\r\nby the uncongenial fate of her new acquaintance, that lady companion,\r\nsecretary, whatever she was. For my own part, I was pleased to discover\r\nin it one more obstacle to intimacy with Madame de S--. I had a\r\npositive abhorrence for the painted, bedizened, dead-faced, glassy-eyed\r\nEgeria of Peter Ivanovitch. I do not know what was her attitude to the\r\nunseen, but I know that in the affairs of this world she was avaricious,\r\ngreedy, and unscrupulous. It was within my knowledge that she had been\r\nworsted in a sordid and desperate quarrel about money matters with the\r\nfamily of her late husband, the diplomatist. Some very august personages\r\nindeed (whom in her fury she had insisted upon scandalously involving\r\nin her affairs) had incurred her animosity. I find it perfectly easy to\r\nbelieve that she had come to within an ace of being spirited away, for\r\nreasons of state, into some discreet _maison de sante_--a madhouse\r\nof sorts, to be plain. It appears, however, that certain high-placed\r\npersonages opposed it for reasons which....\r\n\r\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s no use to go into details.\r\n\r\nWonder may be expressed at a man in the position of a teacher of\r\nlanguages knowing all this with such definiteness. A novelist says this\r\nand that of his personages, and if only he knows how to say it earnestly\r\nenough he may not be questioned upon the inventions of his brain in\r\nwhich his own belief is made sufficiently manifest by a telling phrase,\r\na poetic image, the accent of emotion. Art is great! But I have no art,\r\nand not having invented Madame de S--, I feel bound to explain how I\r\ncame to know so much about her.\r\n\r\nMy informant was the Russian wife of a friend of mine already mentioned,\r\nthe professor of Lausanne University. It was from her that I learned the\r\nlast fact of Madame de S--\xe2\x80\x98s history, with which I intend to trouble\r\nmy readers. She told me, speaking positively, as a person who trusts her\r\nsources, of the cause of Madame de S--\xe2\x80\x98s flight from Russia, some years\r\nbefore. It was neither more nor less than this: that she became suspect\r\nto the police in connexion with the assassination of the Emperor\r\nAlexander. The ground of this suspicion was either some unguarded\r\nexpressions that escaped her in public, or some talk overheard in her\r\nsalon. Overheard, we must believe, by some guest, perhaps a friend, who\r\nhastened to play the informer, I suppose. At any rate, the overheard\r\nmatter seemed to imply her foreknowledge of that event, and I think she\r\nwas wise in not waiting for the investigation of such a charge. Some of\r\nmy readers may remember a little book from her pen, published in Paris,\r\na mystically bad-tempered, declamatory, and frightfully disconnected\r\npiece of writing, in which she all but admits the foreknowledge, more\r\nthan hints at its supernatural origin, and plainly suggests in venomous\r\ninnuendoes that the guilt of the act was not with the terrorists, but\r\nwith a palace intrigue. When I observed to my friend, the professor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, that the life of Madame de S--, with its unofficial diplomacy,\r\nits intrigues, lawsuits, favours, disgrace, expulsions, its atmosphere\r\nof scandal, occultism, and charlatanism, was more fit for the eighteenth\r\ncentury than for the conditions of our own time, she assented with\r\na smile, but a moment after went on in a reflective tone:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlatanism?--yes, in a certain measure. Still, times are changed.\r\nThere are forces now which were non-existent in the eighteenth century.\r\nI should not be surprised if she were more dangerous than an Englishman\r\nwould be willing to believe. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more, she is looked upon as\r\nreally dangerous by certain people--_chez nous_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Chez nous_ in this connexion meant Russia in general, and the Russian\r\npolitical police in particular. The object of my digression from the\r\nstraight course of Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s relation (in my own words) of her visit\r\nto the Chateau Borel, was to bring forward that statement of my friend,\r\nthe professor\xe2\x80\x99s wife. I wanted to bring it forward simply to make what I\r\nhave to say presently of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s presence in Geneva, a little more\r\ncredible--for this is a Russian story for Western ears, which, as I\r\nhave observed already, are not attuned to certain tones of cynicism and\r\ncruelty, of moral negation, and even of moral distress already silenced\r\nat our end of Europe. And this I state as my excuse for having left Miss\r\nHaldin standing, one of the little group of two women and two men who\r\nhad come together below the terrace of the Chateau Borel.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge which I have just stated was in my mind when, as I have\r\nsaid, I interrupted Miss Haldin. I interrupted her with the cry of\r\nprofound satisfaction--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you never saw Madame de S--, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin shook her head. It was very satisfactory to me. She had\r\nnot seen Madame de S--! That was excellent, excellent! I welcomed the\r\nconviction that she would never know Madame de S-- now. I could not\r\nexplain the reason of the conviction but by the knowledge that Miss\r\nHaldin was standing face to face with her brother\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful friend. I\r\npreferred him to Madame de S-- as the companion and guide of that young\r\ngirl, abandoned to her inexperience by the miserable end of her brother.\r\nBut, at any rate, that life now ended had been sincere, and perhaps its\r\nthoughts might have been lofty, its moral sufferings profound, its last\r\nact a true sacrifice. It is not for us, the staid lovers calmed by\r\nthe possession of a conquered liberty, to condemn without appeal the\r\nfierceness of thwarted desire.\r\n\r\nI am not ashamed of the warmth of my regard for Miss Haldin. It was, it\r\nmust be admitted, an unselfish sentiment, being its own reward. The late\r\nVictor Haldin--in the light of that sentiment--appeared to me not as a\r\nsinister conspirator, but as a pure enthusiast. I did not wish indeed\r\nto judge him, but the very fact that he did not escape, that fact which\r\nbrought so much trouble to both his mother and his sister, spoke to me\r\nin his favour. Meantime, in my fear of seeing the girl surrender to the\r\ninfluence of the Chateau Borel revolutionary feminism, I was more than\r\nwilling to put my trust in that friend of the late Victor Haldin. He was\r\nnothing but a name, you will say. Exactly! A name! And what\xe2\x80\x99s more,\r\nthe only name; the only name to be found in the correspondence between\r\nbrother and sister. The young man had turned up; they had come face to\r\nface, and, fortunately, without the direct interference of Madame de\r\nS--. What will come of it? what will she tell me presently? I was\r\nasking myself.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that my thought should turn to the young man, the\r\nbearer of the only name uttered in all the dream-talk of a future to be\r\nbrought about by a revolution. And my thought took the shape of asking\r\nmyself why this young man had not called upon these ladies. He had been\r\nin Geneva for some days before Miss Haldin heard of him first in my\r\npresence from Peter Ivanovitch. I regretted that last\xe2\x80\x99s presence at\r\ntheir meeting. I would rather have had it happen somewhere out of his\r\nspectacled sight. But I supposed that, having both these young people\r\nthere, he introduced them to each other.\r\n\r\nI broke the silence by beginning a question on that point--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Peter Ivanovitch....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin gave vent to her indignation. Peter Ivanovitch directly he\r\nhad got his answer from her had turned upon the _dame de compagnie_ in a\r\nshameful manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurned upon her?\xe2\x80\x9d I wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about? For what reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was unheard of; it was shameful,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin pursued, with angry\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9c_Il lui a fait une scene_--like this, before strangers. And for\r\nwhat? You would never guess. For some eggs.... Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cEggs, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Madame de S--. That lady observes a special diet, or something\r\nof the sort. It seems she complained the day before to Peter Ivanovitch\r\nthat the eggs were not rightly prepared. Peter Ivanovitch suddenly\r\nremembered this against the poor woman, and flew out at her. It was most\r\nastonishing. I stood as if rooted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that the great feminist allowed himself to be\r\nabusive to a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not that! It was something you have no conception of. It was an\r\nodious performance. Imagine, he raised his hat to begin with. He made\r\nhis voice soft and deprecatory. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! you are not kind to us--you will\r\nnot deign to remember....\xe2\x80\x99 This sort of phrases, that sort of tone.\r\nThe poor creature was terribly upset. Her eyes ran full of tears.\r\nShe did not know where to look. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if she would have\r\npreferred abuse, or even a blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not remark that very possibly she was familiar with both on\r\noccasions when no one was by. Miss Haldin walked by my side, her head up\r\nin scornful and angry silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat men have their surprising peculiarities,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed inanely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly like men who are not great. But that sort of thing cannot\r\nbe kept up for ever. How did the great feminist wind up this very\r\ncharacteristic episode?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin, without turning her face my way, told me that the end\r\nwas brought about by the appearance of the interviewer, who had been\r\ncloseted with Madame de S--.\r\n\r\nHe came up rapidly, unnoticed, lifted his hat slightly, and paused to\r\nsay in French: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Baroness has asked me, in case I met a lady on my\r\nway out, to desire her to come in at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter delivering this message, he hurried down the drive. The _dame de\r\ncompagnie_ flew towards the house, and Peter Ivanovitch followed her\r\nhastily, looking uneasy. In a moment Miss Haldin found herself alone\r\nwith the young man, who undoubtedly must have been the new arrival\r\nfrom Russia. She wondered whether her brother\xe2\x80\x99s friend had not already\r\nguessed who she was.\r\n\r\nI am in a position to say that, as a matter of fact, he had guessed.\r\nIt is clear to me that Peter Ivanovitch, for some reason or other, had\r\nrefrained from alluding to these ladies\xe2\x80\x99 presence in Geneva. But Razumov\r\nhad guessed. The trustful girl! Every word uttered by Haldin lived in\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s memory. They were like haunting shapes; they could not be\r\nexorcised. The most vivid amongst them was the mention of the sister.\r\nThe girl had existed for him ever since. But he did not recognize her\r\nat once. Coming up with Peter Ivanovitch, he did observe her; their eyes\r\nhad met, even. He had responded, as no one could help responding, to\r\nthe harmonious charm of her whole person, its strength, its grace, its\r\ntranquil frankness--and then he had turned his gaze away. He said to\r\nhimself that all this was not for him; the beauty of women and the\r\nfriendship of men were not for him. He accepted that feeling with a\r\npurposeful sternness, and tried to pass on. It was only her outstretched\r\nhand which brought about the recognition. It stands recorded in the\r\npages of his self-confession, that it nearly suffocated him physically\r\nwith an emotional reaction of hate and dismay, as though her appearance\r\nhad been a piece of accomplished treachery.\r\n\r\nHe faced about. The considerable elevation of the terrace concealed them\r\nfrom anyone lingering in the doorway of the house; and even from the\r\nupstairs windows they could not have been seen. Through the thickets run\r\nwild, and the trees of the gently sloping grounds, he had cold, placid\r\nglimpses of the lake. A moment of perfect privacy had been vouchsafed\r\nto them at this juncture. I wondered to myself what use they had made of\r\nthat fortunate circumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you have time for more than a few words?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nThat animation with which she had related to me the incidents of her\r\nvisit to the Chateau Borel had left her completely. Strolling by my\r\nside, she looked straight before her; but I noticed a little colour on\r\nher cheek. She did not answer me.\r\n\r\nAfter some little time I observed that they could not have hoped to\r\nremain forgotten for very long, unless the other two had discovered\r\nMadame de S-- swooning with fatigue, perhaps, or in a state of morbid\r\nexaltation after the long interview. Either would require their devoted\r\nministrations. I could depict to myself Peter Ivanovitch rushing busily\r\nout of the house again, bareheaded, perhaps, and on across the terrace\r\nwith his swinging gait, the black skirts of the frock-coat floating\r\nclear of his stout light grey legs. I confess to having looked upon\r\nthese young people as the quarry of the \xe2\x80\x9cheroic fugitive.\xe2\x80\x9d I had the\r\nnotion that they would not be allowed to escape capture. But of that I\r\nsaid nothing to Miss Haldin, only as she still remained uncommunicative,\r\nI pressed her a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--but you can tell me at least your impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her head to look at me, and turned away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpression?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated slowly, almost dreamily; then in a quicker\r\ntone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to be a man who has suffered more from his thoughts than from\r\nevil fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom his thoughts, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is natural enough in a Russian,\xe2\x80\x9d she took me up. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a young\r\nRussian; so many of them are unfit for action, and yet unable to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think he is that sort of man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not judge him. How could I, so suddenly? You asked for my\r\nimpression--I explain my impression. I--I--don\xe2\x80\x99t know the world, nor yet\r\nthe people in it; I have been too solitary--I am too young to trust my\r\nown opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust your instinct,\xe2\x80\x9d I advised her. \xe2\x80\x9cMost women trust to that, and\r\nmake no worse mistakes than men. In this case you have your brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew a deep breath like a light sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cUnstained, lofty, and\r\nsolitary existences,\xe2\x80\x9d she quoted as if to herself. But I caught the\r\nwistful murmur distinctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh praise,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe highest possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo high that, like the award of happiness, it is more fit to come\r\nonly at the end of a life. But still no common or altogether unworthy\r\npersonality could have suggested such a confident exaggeration of praise\r\nand...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d She interrupted me ardently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you had only known the heart\r\nfrom which that judgment has come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ceased on that note, and for a space I reflected on the character of\r\nthe words which I perceived very well must tip the scale of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings in that young man\xe2\x80\x99s favour. They had not the sound of a\r\ncasual utterance. Vague they were to my Western mind and to my Western\r\nsentiment, but I could not forget that, standing by Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nI was like a traveller in a strange country. It had also become clear to\r\nme that Miss Haldin was unwilling to enter into the details of the only\r\nmaterial part of their visit to the Chateau Borel. But I was not hurt.\r\nSomehow I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel it to be a want of confidence. It was some other\r\ndifficulty--a difficulty I could not resent. And it was without the\r\nslightest resentment that I said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. But on that high ground, which I will not dispute, you, like\r\nanyone else in such circumstances, you must have made for yourself\r\na representation of that exceptional friend, a mental image of him,\r\nand--please tell me--you were not disappointed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? His personal appearance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean precisely his good looks, or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned at the end of the alley and made a few steps without looking\r\nat each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis appearance is not ordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I should have thought not--from the little you\xe2\x80\x99ve said of your\r\nfirst impression. After all, one has to fall back on that word.\r\nImpression! What I mean is that something indescribable which is likely\r\nto mark a \xe2\x80\x98not ordinary\xe2\x80\x99 person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI perceived that she was not listening. There was no mistaking her\r\nexpression; and once more I had the sense of being out of it--not\r\nbecause of my age, which at any rate could draw inferences--but\r\naltogether out of it, on another plane whence I could only watch her\r\nfrom afar. And so ceasing to speak I watched her stepping out by my\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI could not have been disappointed with a\r\nman of such strong feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! Strong feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered, thinking to myself censoriously: like\r\nthis, at once, all in a moment!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Miss Haldin innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing. I beg your pardon. Strong feeling. I am not surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how abruptly I behaved to him!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\r\nremorsefully.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have appeared surprised, for, looking at me with a\r\nstill more heightened colour, she said she was ashamed to admit that she\r\nhad not been sufficiently collected; she had failed to control her words\r\nand actions as the situation demanded. She lost the fortitude worthy of\r\nboth the men, the dead and the living; the fortitude which should have\r\nbeen the note of the meeting of Victor Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s sister with Victor\r\nHaldin\xe2\x80\x99s only known friend. He was looking at her keenly, but said\r\nnothing, and she was--she confessed--painfully affected by his want of\r\ncomprehension. All she could say was: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are Mr. Razumov.\xe2\x80\x9d A slight\r\nfrown passed over his forehead. After a short, watchful pause, he made a\r\nlittle bow of assent, and waited.\r\n\r\nAt the thought that she had before her the man so highly regarded by her\r\nbrother, the man who had known his value, spoken to him, understood him,\r\nhad listened to his confidences, perhaps had encouraged him--her lips\r\ntrembled, her eyes ran full of tears; she put out her hand, made a step\r\ntowards him impulsively, saying with an effort to restrain her emotion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you guess who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d He did not take the proffered hand. He\r\neven recoiled a pace, and Miss Haldin imagined that he was unpleasantly\r\naffected. Miss Haldin excused him, directing her displeasure at\r\nherself. She had behaved unworthily, like an emotional French girl.\r\nA manifestation of that kind could not be welcomed by a man of stern,\r\nself-contained character.\r\n\r\nHe must have been stern indeed, or perhaps very timid with women, not\r\nto respond in a more human way to the advances of a girl like Nathalie\r\nHaldin--I thought to myself. Those lofty and solitary existences (I\r\nremembered the words suddenly) make a young man shy and an old man\r\nsavage--often.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I encouraged Miss Haldin to proceed.\r\n\r\nShe was still very dissatisfied with herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went from bad to worse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with an air of discouragement very\r\nforeign to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI did everything foolish except actually bursting into\r\ntears. I am thankful to say I did not do that. But I was unable to speak\r\nfor quite a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had stood before him, speechless, swallowing her sobs, and when\r\nshe managed at last to utter something, it was only her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname--\xe2\x80\x9cVictor--Victor Haldin!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped out, and again her voice\r\nfailed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she commented to me, \xe2\x80\x9cthis distressed him. He was\r\nquite overcome. I have told you my opinion that he is a man of deep\r\nfeeling--it is impossible to doubt it. You should have seen his face.\r\nHe positively reeled. He leaned against the wall of the terrace. Their\r\nfriendship must have been the very brotherhood of souls! I was grateful\r\nto him for that emotion, which made me feel less ashamed of my own lack\r\nof self-control. Of course I had regained the power of speech at once,\r\nalmost. All this lasted not more than a few seconds. \xe2\x80\x98I am his sister,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI said. \xe2\x80\x98Maybe you have heard of me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd had he?\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. How could it have been otherwise? And yet.... But what\r\ndoes that matter? I stood there before him, near enough to be touched\r\nand surely not looking like an impostor. All I know is, that he put\r\nout both his hands then to me, I may say flung them out at me, with\r\nthe greatest readiness and warmth, and that I seized and pressed them,\r\nfeeling that I was finding again a little of what I thought was lost\r\nto me for ever, with the loss of my brother--some of that hope,\r\ninspiration, and support which I used to get from my dear dead....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood quite well what she meant. We strolled on slowly. I\r\nrefrained from looking at her. And it was as if answering my own\r\nthoughts that I murmured--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt it was a great friendship--as you say. And that young man\r\nended by welcoming your name, so to speak, with both hands. After that,\r\nof course, you would understand each other. Yes, you would understand\r\neach other quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a moment before I heard her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Razumov seems to be a man of few words. A reserved man--even when\r\nhe is strongly moved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnable to forget---or even to forgive--the bass-toned expansiveness of\r\nPeter Ivanovitch, the Archpatron of revolutionary parties, I said that\r\nI took this for a favourable trait of character. It was associated with\r\nsincerity--in my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, besides, we had not much time,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you would not have, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d My suspicion and even dread of the\r\nfeminist and his Egeria was so ineradicable that I could not help asking\r\nwith real anxiety, which I made smiling--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you escaped all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe understood me, and smiled too, at my uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! I escaped, if you like to call it that. I walked away quickly.\r\nThere was no need to run. I am neither frightened nor yet fascinated,\r\nlike that poor woman who received me so strangely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr.--Mr. Razumov...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe remained there, of course. I suppose he went into the house after I\r\nleft him. You remember that he came here strongly recommended to Peter\r\nIvanovitch--possibly entrusted with important messages for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes! From that priest who...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Zosim--yes. Or from others, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou left him, then. But have you seen him since, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time Miss Haldin made no answer to this very direct question,\r\nthen--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been expecting to see him here to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have! Do you meet, then, in this garden? In that case I had better\r\nleave you at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, why leave me? And we don\xe2\x80\x99t meet in this garden. I have not seen Mr.\r\nRazumov since that first time. Not once. But I have been expecting\r\nhim....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused. I wondered to myself why that young revolutionist should\r\nshow so little alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore we parted I told Mr. Razumov that I walked here for an hour\r\nevery day at this time. I could not explain to him then why I did not\r\nask him to come and see us at once. Mother must be prepared for such a\r\nvisit. And then, you see, I do not know myself what Mr. Razumov has to\r\ntell us. He, too, must be told first how it is with poor mother. All\r\nthese thoughts flashed through my mind at once. So I told him hurriedly\r\nthat there was a reason why I could not ask him to see us at home, but\r\nthat I was in the habit of walking here.... This is a public place,\r\nbut there are never many people about at this hour. I thought it would\r\ndo very well. And it is so near our apartments. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be very\r\nfar away from mother. Our servant knows where I am in case I should be\r\nwanted suddenly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It is very convenient from that point of view,\xe2\x80\x9d I agreed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I thought the Bastions a very convenient place, since the\r\ngirl did not think it prudent as yet to introduce that young man to\r\nher mother. It was here, then, I thought, looking round at that plot of\r\nground of deplorable banality, that their acquaintance will begin and go\r\non in the exchange of generous indignations and of extreme sentiments,\r\ntoo poignant, perhaps, for a non-Russian mind to conceive. I saw these\r\ntwo, escaped out of four score of millions of human beings ground\r\nbetween the upper and nether millstone, walking under these trees, their\r\nyoung heads close together. Yes, an excellent place to stroll and talk\r\nin. It even occurred to me, while we turned once more away from the wide\r\niron gates, that when tired they would have plenty of accommodation to\r\nrest themselves. There was a quantity of tables and chairs displayed\r\nbetween the restaurant chalet and the bandstand, a whole raft of painted\r\ndeals spread out under the trees. In the very middle of it I observed a\r\nsolitary Swiss couple, whose fate was made secure from the cradle to\r\nthe grave by the perfected mechanism of democratic institutions in a\r\nrepublic that could almost be held in the palm of ones hand. The man,\r\ncolourlessly uncouth, was drinking beer out of a glittering glass; the\r\nwoman, rustic and placid, leaning back in the rough chair, gazed idly\r\naround.\r\n\r\nThere is little logic to be expected on this earth, not only in the\r\nmatter of thought, but also of sentiment. I was surprised to discover\r\nmyself displeased with that unknown young man. A week had gone by since\r\nthey met. Was he callous, or shy, or very stupid? I could not make it\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Miss Haldin, after we had gone some distance up\r\nthe great alley, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr Razumov understood your intention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstood what I meant?\xe2\x80\x9d she wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was greatly moved. That\r\nI know! In my own agitation I could see it. But I spoke distinctly. He\r\nheard me; he seemed, indeed, to hang on my words...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnconsciously she had hastened her pace. Her utterance, too, became\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\nI waited a little before I observed thoughtfully--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet he allowed all these days to pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we tell what work he may have to do here? He is not an idler\r\ntravelling for his pleasure. His time may not be his own--nor yet his\r\nthoughts, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slowed her pace suddenly, and in a lowered voice added--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr his very life\xe2\x80\x9d--then paused and stood still \xe2\x80\x9cFor all I know, he may\r\nhave had to leave Geneva the very day he saw me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout telling you!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not give him time. I left him quite abruptly. I behaved\r\nemotionally to the end. I am sorry for it. Even if I had given him the\r\nopportunity he would have been justified in taking me for a person not\r\nto be trusted. An emotional, tearful girl is not a person to confide in.\r\nBut even if he has left Geneva for a time, I am confident that we shall\r\nmeet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are confident.... I dare say. But on what ground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve told him that I was in great need of some one, a\r\nfellow-countryman, a fellow-believer, to whom I could give my confidence\r\nin a certain matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you what answer he made. I confess that this is good\r\nground for your belief in Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s appearance before long. But he\r\nhas not turned up to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to-day;\xe2\x80\x9d and we stood for a time in\r\nsilence, like people that have nothing more to say to each other and\r\nlet their thoughts run widely asunder before their bodies go off their\r\ndifferent ways. Miss Haldin glanced at the watch on her wrist and made a\r\nbrusque movement. She had already overstayed her time, it seemed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be away from mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, shaking her head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that she is very ill now. But somehow when I am not with her\r\nI am more uneasy than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Haldin had not made the slightest allusion to her son for the last\r\nweek or more. She sat, as usual, in the arm-chair by the window, looking\r\nout silently on that hopeless stretch of the Boulevard des Philosophes.\r\nWhen she spoke, a few lifeless words, it was of indifferent, trivial\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor anyone who knows what the poor soul is thinking of, that sort of\r\ntalk is more painful than her silence. But that is bad too; I can hardly\r\nendure it, and I dare not break it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin sighed, refastening a button of her glove which had come\r\nundone. I knew well enough what a hard time of it she must be having.\r\nThe stress, its causes, its nature, would have undermined the health\r\nof an Occidental girl; but Russian natures have a singular power of\r\nresistance against the unfair strains of life. Straight and supple, with\r\na short jacket open on her black dress, which made her figure appear\r\nmore slender and her fresh but colourless face more pale, she compelled\r\nmy wonder and admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay a moment longer. You ought to come soon to see mother. You\r\nknow she calls you \xe2\x80\x98_L\xe2\x80\x99ami._\xe2\x80\x99 It is an excellent name, and she really\r\nmeans it. And now _au revoir_; I must run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced vaguely down the broad walk--the hand she put out to me\r\neluded my grasp by an unexpected upward movement, and rested upon my\r\nshoulder. Her red lips were slightly parted, not in a smile, however,\r\nbut expressing a sort of startled pleasure. She gazed towards the gates\r\nand said quickly, with a gasp--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! I knew it. Here he comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood that she must mean Mr. Razumov. A young man was walking up\r\nthe alley, without haste. His clothes were some dull shade of brown, and\r\nhe carried a stick. When my eyes first fell on him, his head was hanging\r\non his breast as if in deep thought. While I was looking at him he\r\nraised it sharply, and at once stopped. I am certain he did, but that\r\npause was nothing more perceptible than a faltering check in his gait,\r\ninstantaneously overcome. Then he continued his approach, looking at us\r\nsteadily. Miss Haldin signed to me to remain, and advanced a step or two\r\nto meet him.\r\n\r\nI turned my head away from that meeting, and did not look at them\r\nagain till I heard Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s voice uttering his name in the way\r\nof introduction. Mr. Razumov was informed, in a warm, low tone, that,\r\nbesides being a wonderful teacher, I was a great support \xe2\x80\x9cin our sorrow\r\nand distress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I was described also as an Englishman. Miss Haldin spoke\r\nrapidly, faster than I have ever heard her speak, and that by contrast\r\nmade the quietness of her eyes more expressive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given him my confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking all the time at Mr.\r\nRazumov. That young man did, indeed, rest his gaze on Miss Haldin,\r\nbut certainly did not look into her eyes which were so ready for him.\r\nAfterwards he glanced backwards and forwards at us both, while the faint\r\ncommencement of a forced smile, followed by the suspicion of a frown,\r\nvanished one after another; I detected them, though neither could have\r\nbeen noticed by a person less intensely bent upon divining him than\r\nmyself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Nathalie Haldin had observed, but my attention\r\nseized the very shades of these movements. The attempted smile was given\r\nup, the incipient frown was checked, and smoothed so that there should\r\nbe no sign; but I imagined him exclaiming inwardly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer confidence! To this elderly person--this foreigner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI imagined this because he looked foreign enough to me. I was upon the\r\nwhole favourably impressed. He had an air of intelligence and even\r\nsome distinction quite above the average of the students and other\r\ninhabitants of the _Petite Russie_. His features were more decided\r\nthan in the generality of Russian faces; he had a line of the jaw,\r\na clean-shaven, sallow cheek; his nose was a ridge, and not a mere\r\nprotuberance. He wore the hat well down over his eyes, his dark hair\r\ncurled low on the nape of his neck; in the ill-fitting brown clothes\r\nthere were sturdy limbs; a slight stoop brought out a satisfactory\r\nbreadth of shoulders. Upon the whole I was not disappointed.\r\nStudious--robust--shy.\r\n\r\nBefore Miss Haldin had ceased speaking I felt the grip of his hand on\r\nmine, a muscular, firm grip, but unexpectedly hot and dry. Not a word or\r\neven a mutter assisted this short and arid handshake.\r\n\r\nI intended to leave them to themselves, but Miss Haldin touched me\r\nlightly on the forearm with a significant contact, conveying a distinct\r\nwish. Let him smile who likes, but I was only too ready to stay near\r\nNathalie Haldin, and I am not ashamed to say that it was no smiling\r\nmatter to me. I stayed, not as a youth would have stayed, uplifted, as\r\nit were poised in the air, but soberly, with my feet on the ground and\r\nmy mind trying to penetrate her intention. She had turned to Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell. This is the place. Yes, it is here that I meant you to come. I\r\nhave been walking every day.... Don\xe2\x80\x99t excuse yourself--I understand.\r\nI am grateful to you for coming to-day, but all the same I cannot\r\nstay now. It is impossible. I must hurry off home. Yes, even with you\r\nstanding before me, I must run off. I have been too long away.... You\r\nknow how it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese last words were addressed to me. I noticed that Mr. Razumov passed\r\nthe tip of his tongue over his lips just as a parched, feverish man\r\nmight do. He took her hand in its black glove, which closed on his,\r\nand held it--detained it quite visibly to me against a drawing-back\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you once more for--for understanding me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on warmly. He\r\ninterrupted her with a certain effect of roughness. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him\r\nspeaking to this frank creature so much from under the brim of his hat,\r\nas it were. And he produced a faint, rasping voice quite like a man with\r\na parched throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to thank me for? Understand you?... How did I\r\nunderstand you?... You had better know that I understand nothing.\r\nI was aware that you wanted to see me in this garden. I could not come\r\nbefore. I was hindered. And even to-day, you see...late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe still held his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can, at any rate, thank you for not dismissing me from your mind as\r\na weak, emotional girl. No doubt I want sustaining. I am very ignorant.\r\nBut I can be trusted. Indeed I can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ignorant,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated thoughtfully. He had raised his head,\r\nand was looking straight into her face now, while she held his hand.\r\nThey stood like this for a long moment. She released his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You did come late. It was good of you to come on the chance of\r\nme having loitered beyond my time. I was talking with this good friend\r\nhere. I was talking of you. Yes, Kirylo Sidorovitch, of you. He was with\r\nme when I first heard of your being here in Geneva. He can tell you\r\nwhat comfort it was to my bewildered spirit to hear that news. He knew\r\nI meant to seek you out. It was the only object of my accepting the\r\ninvitation of Peter Ivanovitch....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch talked to you of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, in that\r\nwavering, hoarse voice which suggested a horribly dry throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery little. Just told me your name, and that you had arrived here. Why\r\nshould I have asked for more? What could he have told me that I did not\r\nknow already from my brother\xe2\x80\x99s letter? Three lines! And how much they\r\nmeant to me! I will show them to you one day, Kirylo Sidorovitch. But\r\nnow I must go. The first talk between us cannot be a matter of five\r\nminutes, so we had better not begin....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been standing a little aside, seeing them both in profile. At that\r\nmoment it occurred to me that Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s face was older than his age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf mother\xe2\x80\x9d--the girl had turned suddenly to me, \xe2\x80\x9cwere to wake up in my\r\nabsence (so much longer than usual) she would perhaps question me. She\r\nseems to miss me more, you know, of late. She would want to know what\r\ndelayed me--and, you see, it would be painful for me to dissemble before\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood the point very well. For the same reason she checked what\r\nseemed to be on Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s part a movement to accompany her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! I go alone, but meet me here as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d Then to me\r\nin a lower, significant tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother may be sitting at the window at this moment, looking down\r\nthe street. She must not know anything of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s presence here\r\ntill--till something is arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused before she added a little\r\nlouder, but still speaking to me, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Razumov does not quite understand\r\nmy difficulty, but you know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a quick inclination of the head for us both, and an earnest,\r\nfriendly glance at the young man, Miss Haldin left us covering our heads\r\nand looking after her straight, supple figure receding rapidly. Her walk\r\nwas not that hybrid and uncertain gliding affected by some women, but\r\na frank, strong, healthy movement forward. Rapidly she increased the\r\ndistance--disappeared with suddenness at last. I discovered only then\r\nthat Mr. Razumov, after ramming his hat well over his brow, was looking\r\nme over from head to foot. I dare say I was a very unexpected fact for\r\nthat young Russian to stumble upon. I caught in his physiognomy, in his\r\nwhole bearing, an expression compounded of curiosity and scorn, tempered\r\nby alarm--as though he had been holding his breath while I was not\r\nlooking. But his eyes met mine with a gaze direct enough. I saw then for\r\nthe first time that they were of a clear brown colour and fringed with\r\nthick black eyelashes. They were the youngest feature of his face. Not\r\nat all unpleasant eyes. He swayed slightly, leaning on his stick and\r\ngenerally hung in the wind. It flashed upon me that in leaving us\r\ntogether Miss Haldin had an intention--that something was entrusted to\r\nme, since, by a mere accident I had been found at hand. On this assumed\r\nground I put all possible friendliness into my manner. I cast about\r\nfor some right thing to say, and suddenly in Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s last words I\r\nperceived the clue to the nature of my mission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said gravely, if with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot be expected to\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis clean-shaven lip quivered ever so little before he said, as if\r\nwickedly amused--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut haven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard just now? I was thanked by that young lady for\r\nunderstanding so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him rather hard. Was there a hidden and inexplicable sneer\r\nin this retort? No. It was not that. It might have been resentment. Yes.\r\nBut what had he to resent? He looked as though he had not slept very\r\nwell of late. I could almost feel on me the weight of his unrefreshed,\r\nmotionless stare, the stare of a man who lies unwinking in the dark,\r\nangrily passive in the toils of disastrous thoughts. Now, when I know\r\nhow true it was, I can honestly affirm that this was the effect he\r\nproduced on me. It was painful in a curiously indefinite way--for,\r\nof course, the definition comes to me now while I sit writing in the\r\nfullness of my knowledge. But this is what the effect was at that time\r\nof absolute ignorance. This new sort of uneasiness which he seemed to\r\nbe forcing upon me I attempted to put down by assuming a conversational,\r\neasy familiarity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat extremely charming and essentially admirable young girl (I am--as\r\nyou see--old enough to be frank in my expressions) was referring to her\r\nown feelings. Surely you must have understood that much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made such a brusque movement that he even tottered a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust understand this! Not expected to understand that! I may have other\r\nthings to do. And the girl is charming and admirable. Well--and if she\r\nis! I suppose I can see that for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sally would have been insulting if his voice had not been\r\npractically extinct, dried up in his throat; and the rustling effort of\r\nhis speech too painful to give real offence.\r\n\r\nI remained silent, checked between the obvious fact and the subtle\r\nimpression. It was open to me to leave him there and then; but the sense\r\nof having been entrusted with a mission, the suggestion of Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlast glance, was strong upon me. After a moment of reflection I said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we walk together a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders so violently that he tottered again. I saw it\r\nout of the corner of my eye as I moved on, with him at my elbow. He\r\nhad fallen back a little and was practically out of my sight, unless\r\nI turned my head to look at him. I did not wish to indispose him\r\nstill further by an appearance of marked curiosity. It might have\r\nbeen distasteful to such a young and secret refugee from under the\r\npestilential shadow hiding the true, kindly face of his land. And the\r\nshadow, the attendant of his countrymen, stretching across the middle of\r\nEurope, was lying on him too, darkening his figure to my mental vision.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9che seems a sombre, even a desperate\r\nrevolutionist; but he is young, he may be unselfish and humane, capable\r\nof compassion, of....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard him clear gratingly his parched throat, and became all\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is beyond everything,\xe2\x80\x9d were his first words. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is beyond\r\neverything! I find you here, for no reason that I can understand, in\r\npossession of something I cannot be expected to understand! A confidant!\r\nA foreigner! Talking about an admirable Russian girl. Is the admirable\r\ngirl a fool, I begin to wonder? What are you at? What is your object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was barely audible, as if his throat had no more resonance than a dry\r\nrag, a piece of tinder. It was so pitiful that I found it extremely easy\r\nto control my indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have lived a little longer, Mr. Razumov, you will discover\r\nthat no woman is an absolute fool. I am not a feminist, like that\r\nillustrious author, Peter Ivanovitch, who, to say the truth, is not a\r\nlittle suspect to me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe interrupted me, in a surprising note of whispering astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspect to you! Peter Ivanovitch suspect to you! To you!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in a certain aspect he is,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, dismissing my remark lightly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was saying, Mr. Razumov, when you have lived long enough, you will\r\nlearn to discriminate between the noble trustfulness of a nature foreign\r\nto every meanness and the flattered credulity of some women; though even\r\nthe credulous, silly as they may be, unhappy as they are sure to be, are\r\nnever absolute fools. It is my belief that no woman is ever completely\r\ndeceived. Those that are lost leap into the abyss with their eyes open,\r\nif all the truth were known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried at my elbow, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it to me whether women\r\nare fools or lunatics? I really don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you think of them. I--I\r\nam not interested in them. I let them be. I am not a young man in a\r\nnovel. How do you know that I want to learn anything about women?...\r\nWhat is the meaning of all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe object, you mean, of this conversation, which I admit I have forced\r\nupon you in a measure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForced! Object!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, still keeping half a pace or so behind\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to talk about women, apparently. That\xe2\x80\x99s a subject. But\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for it. I have never.... In fact, I have had other\r\nsubjects to think about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am concerned here with one woman only--a young girl--the sister of\r\nyour dead friend--Miss Haldin. Surely you can think a little of her.\r\nWhat I meant from the first was that there is a situation which you\r\ncannot be expected to understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI listened to his unsteady footfalls by my side for the space of several\r\nstrides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that it may prepare the ground for your next interview with\r\nMiss Haldin if I tell you of it. I imagine that she might have had\r\nsomething of the kind in her mind when she left us together. I believe\r\nmyself authorized to speak. The peculiar situation I have alluded to\r\nhas arisen in the first grief and distress of Victor Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s execution.\r\nThere was something peculiar in the circumstances of his arrest. You no\r\ndoubt know the whole truth....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt my arm seized above the elbow, and next instant found myself\r\nswung so as to face Mr. Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spring up from the ground before me with this talk. Who the devil\r\nare you? This is not to be borne! Why! What for? What do you know\r\nwhat is or is not peculiar? What have you to do with any confounded\r\ncircumstances, or with anything that happens in Russia, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned on his stick with his other hand, heavily; and when he let go\r\nmy arm, I was certain in my mind that he was hardly able to keep on his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us sit down at one of these vacant tables,\xe2\x80\x9d I proposed,\r\ndisregarding this display of unexpectedly profound emotion. It was not\r\nwithout its effect on me, I confess. I was sorry for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat tables? What are you talking about? Oh--the empty tables? The\r\ntables there. Certainly. I will sit at one of the empty tables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI led him away from the path to the very centre of the raft of deals\r\nbefore the _chalet_. The Swiss couple were gone by that time. We were\r\nalone on the raft, so to speak. Mr. Razumov dropped into a chair, let\r\nfall his stick, and propped on his elbows, his head between his hands,\r\nstared at me persistently, openly, and continuously, while I signalled\r\nthe waiter and ordered some beer. I could not quarrel with this silent\r\ninspection very well, because, truth to tell, I felt somewhat guilty of\r\nhaving been sprung on him with some abruptness--of having \xe2\x80\x9csprung from\r\nthe ground,\xe2\x80\x9d as he expressed it.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting to be served I mentioned that, born from parents settled\r\nin St. Petersburg, I had acquired the language as a child. The town I\r\ndid not remember, having left it for good as a boy of nine, but in later\r\nyears I had renewed my acquaintance with the language. He listened,\r\nwithout as much as moving his eyes the least little bit. He had to\r\nchange his position when the beer came, and the instant draining of his\r\nglass revived him. He leaned back in his chair and, folding his arms\r\nacross his chest, continued to stare at me squarely. It occurred to me\r\nthat his clean-shaven, almost swarthy face was really of the very mobile\r\nsort, and that the absolute stillness of it was the acquired habit of\r\na revolutionist, of a conspirator everlastingly on his guard against\r\nself-betrayal in a world of secret spies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are an Englishman--a teacher of English literature,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured, in a voice that was no longer issuing from a parched throat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of you. People told me you have lived here for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true. More than twenty years. And I have been assisting Miss\r\nHaldin with her English studies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been reading English poetry with her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, immovable now,\r\nlike another man altogether, a complete stranger to the man of the heavy\r\nand uncertain footfalls a little while ago--at my elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, English poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the trouble of which I speak was\r\ncaused by an English newspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to stare at me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was aware that the story\r\nof the midnight arrest had been ferreted out by an English journalist\r\nand given to the world. When I explained this to him he muttered\r\ncontemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cIt may have been altogether a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you are the best judge of that,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted, a little\r\ndisconcerted. \xe2\x80\x9cI must confess that to me it looks to be true in the\r\nmain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you tell truth from lies?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried in his new, immovable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you do it in Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, rather nettled by his\r\nattitude. He interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Russia, and in general everywhere--in a newspaper, for instance. The\r\ncolour of the ink and the shapes of the letters are the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there are other trifles one can go by. The character of the\r\npublication, the general verisimilitude of the news, the consideration\r\nof the motive, and so on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust blindly the accuracy of special\r\ncorrespondents--but why should this one have gone to the trouble of\r\nconcocting a circumstantial falsehood on a matter of no importance to\r\nthe world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he grumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on with us is of\r\nno importance--a mere sensational story to amuse the readers of the\r\npapers--the superior contemptuous Europe. It is hateful to think of. But\r\nlet them wait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off on this sort of threat addressed to the western world.\r\nDisregarding the anger in his stare, I pointed out that whether the\r\njournalist was well- or ill-informed, the concern of the friends of\r\nthese ladies was with the effect the few lines of print in question had\r\nproduced--the effect alone. And surely he must be counted as one of\r\nthe friends--if only for the sake of his late comrade and intimate\r\nfellow-revolutionist. At that point I thought he was going to speak\r\nvehemently; but he only astounded me by the convulsive start of his\r\nwhole body. He restrained himself, folded his loosened arms tighter\r\nacross his chest, and sat back with a smile in which there was a twitch\r\nof scorn and malice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a comrade and an intimate.... Very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ventured to speak to you on that assumption. And I cannot be\r\nmistaken. I was present when Peter Ivanovitch announced your arrival\r\nhere to Miss Haldin, and I saw her relief and thankfulness when your\r\nname was mentioned. Afterwards she showed me her brother\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\r\nand read out the few words in which he alludes to you. What else but a\r\nfriend could you have been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObviously. That\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly well known. A friend. Quite correct....\r\nGo on. You were talking of some effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cHe puts on the callousness of a stern revolutionist,\r\nthe insensibility to common emotions of a man devoted to a destructive\r\nidea. He is young, and his sincerity assumes a pose before a stranger,\r\na foreigner, an old man. Youth must assert itself....\xe2\x80\x9d As concisely\r\nas possible I exposed to him the state of mind poor Mrs. Haldin had been\r\nthrown into by the news of her son\xe2\x80\x99s untimely end.\r\n\r\nHe listened--I felt it--with profound attention. His level stare\r\ndeflected gradually downwards, left my face, and rested at last on the\r\nground at his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can enter into the sister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. As you said, I have only read\r\na little English poetry with her, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t make myself ridiculous in\r\nyour eyes by trying to speak of her. But you have seen her. She is one\r\nof these rare human beings that do not want explaining. At least I think\r\nso. They had only that son, that brother, for a link with the wider\r\nworld, with the future. The very groundwork of active existence for\r\nNathalie Haldin is gone with him. Can you wonder then that she turns\r\nwith eagerness to the only man her brother mentions in his letters. Your\r\nname is a sort of legacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could he have written of me?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, in a low, exasperated\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a few words. It is not for me to repeat them to you, Mr. Razumov;\r\nbut you may believe my assertion that these words are forcible enough to\r\nmake both his mother and his sister believe implicitly in the worth of\r\nyour judgment and in the truth of anything you may have to say to them.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for you now to pass them by like strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI paused, and for a moment sat listening to the footsteps of the few\r\npeople passing up and down the broad central walk. While I was speaking\r\nhis head had sunk upon his breast above his folded arms. He raised it\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I go then and lie to that old woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not anger; it was something else, something more poignant, and\r\nnot so simple. I was aware of it sympathetically, while I was profoundly\r\nconcerned at the nature of that exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! Won\xe2\x80\x99t the truth do, then? I hoped you could have told them\r\nsomething consoling. I am thinking of the poor mother now. Your Russia\r\n_is_ a cruel country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved a little in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would have had something authentic to\r\ntell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe twitching of his lips before he spoke was curious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if it is not worth telling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot worth--from what point of view? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom every point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spoke with some asperity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think that anything which could explain the circumstances of\r\nthat midnight arrest....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReported by a journalist for the amusement of the civilized Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nbroke in scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, reported.... But aren\xe2\x80\x99t they true? I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out your\r\nattitude in this? Either the man is a hero to you, or...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe approached his face with fiercely distended nostrils close to mine so\r\nsuddenly that I had the greatest difficulty in not starting back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me! I suppose it amuses you, all this. Look here! I am a\r\nworker. I studied. Yes, I studied very hard. There is intelligence\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d (He tapped his forehead with his finger-tips.) \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think a\r\nRussian may have sane ambitions? Yes--I had even prospects. Certainly! I\r\nhad. And now you see me here, abroad, everything gone, lost, sacrificed.\r\nYou see me here--and you ask! You see me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?--sitting before\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw himself back violently. I kept outwardly calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see you here; and I assume you are here on account of the Haldin\r\naffair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis manner changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou call it the Haldin affair--do you?\xe2\x80\x9d he observed indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no right to ask you anything,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume. But\r\nin that case the mother and the sister of him who must be a hero in\r\nyour eyes cannot be indifferent to you. The girl is a frank and generous\r\ncreature, having the noblest--well--illusions. You will tell her\r\nnothing--or you will tell her everything. But speaking now of the object\r\nwith which I\xe2\x80\x99ve approached you first, we have to deal with the morbid\r\nstate of the mother. Perhaps something could be invented under your\r\nauthority as a cure for a distracted and suffering soul filled with\r\nmaternal affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis air of weary indifference was accentuated, I could not help\r\nthinking, wilfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. Something might,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled carelessly.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand over his mouth to conceal a yawn. When he uncovered his\r\nlips they were smiling faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me. This has been a long conversation, and I have not had much\r\nsleep the last two nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis unexpected, somewhat insolent sort of apology had the merit of\r\nbeing perfectly true. He had had no nightly rest to speak of since that\r\nday when, in the grounds of the Chateau Borel, the sister of Victor\r\nHaldin had appeared before him. The perplexities and the complex\r\nterrors--I may say--of this sleeplessness are recorded in the document\r\nI was to see later--the document which is the main source of this\r\nnarrative. At the moment he looked to me convincingly tired, gone slack\r\nall over, like a man who has passed through some sort of crisis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a lot of urgent writing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nI rose from my chair at once, and he followed my example, without haste,\r\na little heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must apologize for detaining you so long,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy apologize? One can\xe2\x80\x99t very well go to bed before night. And you did\r\nnot detain me. I could have left you at any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not stayed with him to be offended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you have been sufficiently interested,\xe2\x80\x9d I said calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nmerit of mine, though--the commonest sort of regard for the mother of\r\nyour friend was enough.... As to Miss Haldin herself, she at one time\r\nwas disposed to think that her brother had been betrayed to the police\r\nin some way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise Mr. Razumov sat down again suddenly. I stared at\r\nhim, and I must say that he returned my stare without winking for quite\r\na considerable time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some way,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled, as if he had not understood or could not\r\nbelieve his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome unforeseen event, a sheer accident might have done that,\xe2\x80\x9d I went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cOr, as she characteristically put it to me, the folly or weakness\r\nof some unhappy fellow-revolutionist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolly or weakness,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a very generous creature,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed after a time. The man\r\nadmired by Victor Haldin fixed his eyes on the ground. I turned away and\r\nmoved off, apparently unnoticed by him. I nourished no resentment of\r\nthe moody brusqueness with which he had treated me. The sentiment I was\r\ncarrying away from that conversation was that of hopelessness. Before\r\nI had got fairly clear of the raft of chairs and tables he had rejoined\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d I heard him at my elbow again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not look round even.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that you people are under a curse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no sound. It was only on the pavement outside the gate that I\r\nheard him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to walk with you a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter all, I preferred this enigmatical young man to his celebrated\r\ncompatriot, the great Peter Ivanovitch. But I saw no reason for being\r\nparticularly gracious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going now to the railway station, by the shortest way from here,\r\nto meet a friend from England,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, for all answer to his unexpected\r\nproposal. I hoped that something informing could come of it. As we stood\r\non the curbstone waiting for a tramcar to pass, he remarked gloomily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like what you said just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe stepped off the pavement together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis to understand thoroughly the nature\r\nof the curse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not very difficult, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so too,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed with me, and his readiness, strangely\r\nenough, did not make him less enigmatical in the least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA curse is an evil spell,\xe2\x80\x9d I tried him again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the important, the\r\ngreat problem, is to find the means to break it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. To find the means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was also an assent, but he seemed to be thinking of something else.\r\nWe had crossed diagonally the open space before the theatre, and began\r\nto descend a broad, sparely frequented street in the direction of one of\r\nthe smaller bridges. He kept on by my side without speaking for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not thinking of leaving Geneva soon?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe was silent for so long that I began to think I had been indiscreet,\r\nand should get no answer at all. Yet on looking at him I almost believed\r\nthat my question had caused him something in the nature of positive\r\nanguish. I detected it mainly in the clasping of his hands, in which he\r\nput a great force stealthily. Once, however, he had overcome that sort\r\nof agonizing hesitation sufficiently to tell me that he had no such\r\nintention, he became rather communicative--at least relatively to\r\nthe former off-hand curtness of his speeches. The tone, too, was more\r\namiable. He informed me that he intended to study and also to write. He\r\nwent even so far as to tell me he had been to Stuttgart. Stuttgart, I\r\nwas aware, was one of the revolutionary centres. The directing committee\r\nof one of the Russian parties (I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell now which) was located in\r\nthat town. It was there that he got into touch with the active work of\r\nthe revolutionists outside Russia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been abroad before,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, in a rather inanimate\r\nvoice now. Then, after a slight hesitation, altogether different from\r\nthe agonizing irresolution my first simple question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether he meant to\r\nstay in Geneva\xe2\x80\x9d had aroused, he made me an unexpected confidence--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I have received a sort of mission from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich will keep you here in Geneva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Here. In this odious....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was satisfied with my faculty for putting two and two together when I\r\ndrew the inference that the mission had something to do with the\r\nperson of the great Peter Ivanovitch. But I kept that surmise to myself\r\nnaturally, and Mr. Razumov said nothing more for some considerable time.\r\nIt was only when we were nearly on the bridge we had been making for\r\nthat he opened his lips again, abruptly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I see that precious article anywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had to think for a moment before I saw what he was referring to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been reproduced in parts by the Press here. There are files to\r\nbe seen in various places. My copy of the English newspaper I have left\r\nwith Miss Haldin, I remember, on the day after it reached me. I was\r\nsufficiently worried by seeing it lying on a table by the side of the\r\npoor mother\xe2\x80\x99s chair for weeks. Then it disappeared. It was a relief, I\r\nassure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will find time to see these ladies\r\nfairly often--that you will make time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared at me so queerly that I hardly know how to define his aspect.\r\nI could not understand it in this connexion at all. What ailed him? I\r\nasked myself. What strange thought had come into his head? What vision\r\nof all the horrors that can be seen in his hopeless country had come\r\nsuddenly to haunt his brain? If it were anything connected with the fate\r\nof Victor Haldin, then I hoped earnestly he would keep it to himself\r\nfor ever. I was, to speak plainly, so shocked that I tried to conceal my\r\nimpression by--Heaven forgive me--a smile and the assumption of a light\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat needn\xe2\x80\x99t cost you a great effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away from me and leaned over the parapet of the bridge. For a\r\nmoment I waited, looking at his back. And yet, I assure you, I was not\r\nanxious just then to look at his face again. He did not move at all. He\r\ndid not mean to move. I walked on slowly on my way towards the station,\r\nand at the end of the bridge I glanced over my shoulder. No, he had not\r\nmoved. He hung well over the parapet, as if captivated by the smooth\r\nrush of the blue water under the arch. The current there is swift,\r\nextremely swift; it makes some people dizzy; I myself can never look at\r\nit for any length of time without experiencing a dread of being suddenly\r\nsnatched away by its destructive force. Some brains cannot resist the\r\nsuggestion of irresistible power and of headlong motion.\r\n\r\nIt apparently had a charm for Mr. Razumov. I left him hanging far over\r\nthe parapet of the bridge. The way he had behaved to me could not be put\r\ndown to mere boorishness. There was something else under his scorn and\r\nimpatience. Perhaps, I thought, with sudden approach to hidden truth,\r\nit was the same thing which had kept him over a week, nearly ten days\r\nindeed, from coming near Miss Haldin. But what it was I could not tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe water under the bridge ran violent and deep. Its slightly undulating\r\nrush seemed capable of scouring out a channel for itself through solid\r\ngranite while you looked. But had it flowed through Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\r\nit could not have washed away the accumulated bitterness the wrecking of\r\nhis life had deposited there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of all this?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, staring downwards at\r\nthe headlong flow so smooth and clean that only the passage of a faint\r\nair-bubble, or a thin vanishing streak of foam like a white hair,\r\ndisclosed its vertiginous rapidity, its terrible force. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy has that\r\nmeddlesome old Englishman blundered against me? And what is this silly\r\ntale of a crazy old woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was trying to think brutally on purpose, but he avoided any mental\r\nreference to the young girl. \xe2\x80\x9cA crazy old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fatality! Or ought I to despise all this as absurd?\r\nBut no! I am wrong! I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to despise anything. An absurdity may\r\nbe the starting-point of the most dangerous complications. How is one\r\nto guard against it? It puts to rout one\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence. The more\r\nintelligent one is the less one suspects an absurdity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA wave of wrath choked his thoughts for a moment. It even made his body\r\nleaning over the parapet quiver; then he resumed his silent thinking,\r\nlike a secret dialogue with himself. And even in that privacy, his\r\nthought had some reservations of which he was vaguely conscious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, this is not absurd. It is insignificant. It is absolutely\r\ninsignificant--absolutely. The craze of an old woman--the fussy\r\nofficiousness of a blundering elderly Englishman. What devil put him in\r\nthe way? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I treated him cavalierly enough? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I just? That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe way to treat these meddlesome persons. Is it possible that he still\r\nstands behind my back, waiting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov felt a faint chill run down his spine. It was not fear. He was\r\ncertain that it was not fear--not fear for himself--but it was, all the\r\nsame, a sort of apprehension as if for another, for some one he\r\nknew without being able to put a name on the personality. But the\r\nrecollection that the officious Englishman had a train to meet\r\ntranquillized him for a time. It was too stupid to suppose that he\r\nshould be wasting his time in waiting. It was unnecessary to look round\r\nand make sure.\r\n\r\nBut what did the man mean by his extraordinary rigmarole about the\r\nnewspaper, and that crazy old woman? he thought suddenly. It was a\r\ndamnable presumption, anyhow, something that only an Englishman could\r\nbe capable of. All this was a sort of sport for him--the sport of\r\nrevolution--a game to look at from the height of his superiority. And\r\nwhat on earth did he mean by his exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t the truth do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov pressed his folded arms to the stone coping over which he was\r\nleaning with force. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t the truth do? The truth for the crazy old\r\nmother of the--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man shuddered again. Yes. The truth would do! Apparently\r\nit would do. Exactly. And receive thanks, he thought, formulating the\r\nunspoken words cynically. \xe2\x80\x9cFall on my neck in gratitude, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\njeered mentally. But this mood abandoned him at once. He felt sad, as\r\nif his heart had become empty suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must be cautious,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconcluded, coming to himself as though his brain had been awakened from\r\na trance. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing, no one, too insignificant, too absurd to be\r\ndisregarded,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be cautious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov pushed himself with his hand away from the balustrade and,\r\nretracing his steps along the bridge, walked straight to his lodgings,\r\nwhere, for a few days, he led a solitary and retired existence. He\r\nneglected Peter Ivanovitch, to whom he was accredited by the Stuttgart\r\ngroup; he never went near the refugee revolutionists, to whom he had\r\nbeen introduced on his arrival. He kept out of that world altogether.\r\nAnd he felt that such conduct, causing surprise and arousing suspicion,\r\ncontained an element of danger for himself.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that during these few days he never went out. I met\r\nhim several times in the streets, but he gave me no recognition.\r\nOnce, going home after an evening call on the ladies Haldin, I saw him\r\ncrossing the dark roadway of the Boulevard des Philosophes. He had a\r\nbroad-brimmed soft hat, and the collar of his coat turned up. I watched\r\nhim make straight for the house, but, instead of going in, he stopped\r\nopposite the still lighted windows, and after a time went away down a\r\nside-street.\r\n\r\nI knew that he had not been to see Mrs. Haldin yet. Miss Haldin told\r\nme he was reluctant; moreover, the mental condition of Mrs. Haldin\r\nhad changed. She seemed to think now that her son was living, and she\r\nperhaps awaited his arrival. Her immobility in the great arm-chair in\r\nfront of the window had an air of expectancy, even when the blind was\r\ndown and the lamps lighted.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I was convinced that she had received her death-stroke;\r\nMiss Haldin, to whom, of course, I said nothing of my forebodings,\r\nthought that no good would come from introducing Mr. Razumov just then,\r\nan opinion which I shared fully. I knew that she met the young man on\r\nthe Bastions. Once or twice I saw them strolling slowly up the main\r\nalley. They met every day for weeks. I avoided passing that way during\r\nthe hour when Miss Haldin took her exercise there. One day, however,\r\nin a fit of absent-mindedness, I entered the gates and came upon her\r\nwalking alone. I stopped to exchange a few words. Mr. Razumov failed to\r\nturn up, and we began to talk about him--naturally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you anything definite about your brother\xe2\x80\x99s activities--his\r\nend?\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Miss Haldin, with some hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing definite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood well enough that all their conversations must have been\r\nreferred mentally to that dead man who had brought them together. That\r\nwas unavoidable. But it was in the living man that she was interested.\r\nThat was unavoidable too, I suppose. And as I pushed my inquiries\r\nI discovered that he had disclosed himself to her as a by no means\r\nconventional revolutionist, contemptuous of catchwords, of theories, of\r\nmen too. I was rather pleased at that--but I was a little puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis mind goes forward, far ahead of the struggle,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin\r\nexplained. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he is an actual worker too,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you understand him?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired point-blank.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated again. \xe2\x80\x9cNot altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nI perceived that he had fascinated her by an assumption of mysterious\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I think?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, breaking through her reserved,\r\nalmost reluctant attitude: \xe2\x80\x9cI think that he is observing, studying me,\r\nto discover whether I am worthy of his trust....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that pleases you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept mysteriously silent for a moment. Then with energy, but in a\r\nconfidential tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced;\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this extraordinary man is\r\nmeditating some vast plan, some great undertaking; he is possessed by\r\nit--he suffers from it--and from being alone in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for helpers?\xe2\x80\x9d I commented, turning away my head.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\nThe dead brother, the dying mother, the foreign friend, had fallen\r\ninto a distant background. But, at the same time, Peter Ivanovitch was\r\nabsolutely nowhere now. And this thought consoled me. Yet I saw the\r\ngigantic shadow of Russian life deepening around her like the darkness\r\nof an advancing night. It would devour her presently. I inquired after\r\nMrs. Haldin--that other victim of the deadly shade.\r\n\r\nA remorseful uneasiness appeared in her frank eyes. Mother seemed no\r\nworse, but if I only knew what strange fancies she had sometimes! Then\r\nMiss Haldin, glancing at her watch, declared that she could not stay a\r\nmoment longer, and with a hasty hand-shake ran off lightly.\r\n\r\nDecidedly, Mr. Razumov was not to turn up that day. Incomprehensible\r\nyouth!\r\n\r\nBut less than an hour afterwards, while crossing the Place Mollard, I\r\ncaught sight of him boarding a South Shore tramcar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s going to the Chateau Borel,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter depositing Razumov at the gates of the Chateau Borel, some half\r\na mile or so from the town, the car continued its journey between two\r\nstraight lines of shady trees. Across the roadway in the sunshine a\r\nshort wooden pier jutted into the shallow pale water, which farther out\r\nhad an intense blue tint contrasting unpleasantly with the green orderly\r\nslopes on the opposite shore. The whole view, with the harbour jetties\r\nof white stone underlining lividly the dark front of the town to\r\nthe left, and the expanding space of water to the right with jutting\r\npromontories of no particular character, had the uninspiring, glittering\r\nquality of a very fresh oleograph. Razumov turned his back on it with\r\ncontempt. He thought it odious--oppressively odious--in its unsuggestive\r\nfinish: the very perfection of mediocrity attained at last after\r\ncenturies of toil and culture. And turning his back on it, he faced the\r\nentrance to the grounds of the Chateau Borel.\r\n\r\nThe bars of the central way and the wrought-iron arch between the dark\r\nweather-stained stone piers were very rusty; and, though fresh tracks of\r\nwheels ran under it, the gate looked as if it had not been opened for\r\na very long time. But close against the lodge, built of the same grey\r\nstone as the piers (its windows were all boarded up), there was a small\r\nside entrance. The bars of that were rusty too; it stood ajar and looked\r\nas though it had not been closed for a long time. In fact, Razumov,\r\ntrying to push it open a little wider, discovered it was immovable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemocratic virtue. There are no thieves here, apparently,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered\r\nto himself, with displeasure. Before advancing into the grounds he\r\nlooked back sourly at an idle working man lounging on a bench in the\r\nclean, broad avenue. The fellow had thrown his feet up; one of his arms\r\nhung over the low back of the public seat; he was taking a day off in\r\nlordly repose, as if everything in sight belonged to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElector! Eligible! Enlightened!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov muttered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cA brute,\r\nall the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov entered the grounds and walked fast up the wide sweep of\r\nthe drive, trying to think of nothing--to rest his head, to rest his\r\nemotions too. But arriving at the foot of the terrace before the house\r\nhe faltered, affected physically by some invisible interference. The\r\nmysteriousness of his quickened heart-beats startled him. He stopped\r\nshort and looked at the brick wall of the terrace, faced with shallow\r\narches, meagrely clothed by a few unthriving creepers, with an ill-kept\r\nnarrow flower-bed along its foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, with a sort of awe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is here--on this very\r\nspot....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was tempted to flight at the mere recollection of his first meeting\r\nwith Nathalie Haldin. He confessed it to himself; but he did not move,\r\nand that not because he wished to resist an unworthy weakness, but\r\nbecause he knew that he had no place to fly to. Moreover, he could\r\nnot leave Geneva. He recognized, even without thinking, that it was\r\nimpossible. It would have been a fatal admission, an act of moral\r\nsuicide. It would have been also physically dangerous. Slowly he\r\nascended the stairs of the terrace, flanked by two stained greenish\r\nstone urns of funereal aspect.\r\n\r\nAcross the broad platform, where a few blades of grass sprouted on the\r\ndiscoloured gravel, the door of the house, with its ground-floor windows\r\nshuttered, faced him, wide open. He believed that his approach had\r\nbeen noted, because, framed in the doorway, without his tall hat, Peter\r\nIvanovitch seemed to be waiting for his approach.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonious black frock-coat and the bared head of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s greatest\r\nfeminist accentuated the dubiousness of his status in the house rented\r\nby Madame de S--, his Egeria. His aspect combined the formality of the\r\ncaller with the freedom of the proprietor. Florid and bearded and masked\r\nby the dark blue glasses, he met the visitor, and at once took him\r\nfamiliarly under the arm.\r\n\r\nRazumov suppressed every sign of repugnance by an effort which the\r\nconstant necessity of prudence had rendered almost mechanical. And\r\nthis necessity had settled his expression in a cast of austere, almost\r\nfanatical, aloofness. The \xe2\x80\x9cheroic fugitive,\xe2\x80\x9d impressed afresh by the\r\nsevere detachment of this new arrival from revolutionary Russia, took a\r\nconciliatory, even a confidential tone. Madame de S-- was resting after\r\na bad night. She often had bad nights. He had left his hat upstairs on\r\nthe landing and had come down to suggest to his young friend a stroll\r\nand a good open-hearted talk in one of the shady alleys behind the\r\nhouse. After voicing this proposal, the great man glanced at the unmoved\r\nface by his side, and could not restrain himself from exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word, young man, you are an extraordinary person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy you are mistaken, Peter Ivanovitch. If I were really an\r\nextraordinary person, I would not be here, walking with you in a garden\r\nin Switzerland, Canton of Geneva, Commune of--what\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the\r\nCommune this place belongs to?... Never mind--the heart of democracy,\r\nanyhow. A fit heart for it; no bigger than a parched pea and about as\r\nmuch value. I am no more extraordinary than the rest of us Russians,\r\nwandering abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Peter Ivanovitch dissented emphatically--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! You are not ordinary. I have some experience of Russians who\r\nare--well--living abroad. You appear to me, and to others too, a marked\r\npersonality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he mean by this?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov asked himself, turning his eyes\r\nfully on his companion. The face of Peter Ivanovitch expressed a\r\nmeditative seriousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, Kirylo Sidorovitch, that I have not heard of you\r\nfrom various points where you made yourself known on your way here? I\r\nhave had letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we are great in talking about each other,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected Razumov, who\r\nhad listened with great attention. \xe2\x80\x9cGossip, tales, suspicions, and\r\nall that sort of thing, we know how to deal in to perfection. Calumny,\r\neven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn indulging in this sally, Razumov managed very well to conceal the\r\nfeeling of anxiety which had come over him. At the same time he was\r\nsaying to himself that there could be no earthly reason for anxiety. He\r\nwas relieved by the evident sincerity of the protesting voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter Ivanovitch. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about? What\r\nreason can _you_ have to...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great exile flung up his arms as if words had failed him in sober\r\ntruth. Razumov was satisfied. Yet he was moved to continue in the same\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am talking of the poisonous plants which flourish in the world of\r\nconspirators, like evil mushrooms in a dark cellar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are casting aspersions,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Peter Ivanovitch, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich as\r\nfar as you are concerned--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov interrupted without heat. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to cast\r\naspersions, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just as well to have no illusions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch gave him an inscrutable glance of his dark spectacles,\r\naccompanied by a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who says that he has no illusions has at least that one,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in a very friendly tone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I see how it is, Kirylo Sidorovitch.\r\nYou aim at stoicism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStoicism! That\xe2\x80\x99s a pose of the Greeks and the Romans. Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave\r\nit to them. We are Russians, that is--children; that is--sincere; that\r\nis--cynical, if you like. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not a pose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued. They strolled slowly under the lime-trees.\r\nPeter Ivanovitch had put his hands behind his back. Razumov felt the\r\nungravelled ground of the deeply shaded walk damp and as if slippery\r\nunder his feet. He asked himself, with uneasiness, if he were saying the\r\nright things. The direction of the conversation ought to have been more\r\nunder his control, he reflected. The great man appeared to be reflecting\r\non his side too. He cleared his throat slightly, and Razumov felt at\r\nonce a painful reawakening of scorn and fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am astonished,\xe2\x80\x9d began Peter Ivanovitch gently. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing you are\r\nright in your indictment, how can you raise any question of calumny\r\nor gossip, in your case? It is unreasonable. The fact is, Kirylo\r\nSidorovitch, there is not enough known of you to give hold to gossip or\r\neven calumny. Just now you are a man associated with a great deed, which\r\nhad been hoped for, and tried for too, without success. People have\r\nperished for attempting that which you and Haldin have done at last. You\r\ncome to us out of Russia, with that prestige. But you cannot deny that\r\nyou have not been communicative, Kirylo Sidorovitch. People you have met\r\nimparted their impressions to me; one wrote this, another that, but I\r\nform my own opinions. I waited to see you first. You are a man out\r\nof the common. That\xe2\x80\x99s positively so. You are close, very close. This\r\ntaciturnity, this severe brow, this something inflexible and secret in\r\nyou, inspires hopes and a little wonder as to what you may mean. There\r\nis something of a Brutus....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray spare me those classical allusions!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Razumov nervously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat comes Junius Brutus to do here? It is ridiculous! Do you mean to\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x9d he added sarcastically, but lowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Russian\r\nrevolutionists are all patricians and that I am an aristocrat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch, who had been helping himself with a few gestures,\r\nclasped his hands again behind his back, and made a few steps,\r\npondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _all_ patricians,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered at last. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you, at any rate, are\r\none of _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure my name is not Gugenheimer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a sneering tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam not a democratic Jew. How can I help it? Not everybody has such luck.\r\nI have no name, I have no....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe European celebrity showed a great concern. He stepped back a pace\r\nand his arms flew in front of his person, extended, deprecatory, almost\r\nentreating. His deep bass voice was full of pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear young friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Kirylo Sidorovitch....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very patronymic you are so civil as to use when addressing me I\r\nhave no legal right to--but what of that? I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to claim it.\r\nI have no father. So much the better. But I will tell you what: my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather was a peasant--a serf. See how much I am one of\r\n_you_. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to claim me. But Russia _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ disown me.\r\nShe cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov struck his breast with his fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am _it_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch walked on slowly, his head lowered. Razumov followed,\r\nvexed with himself. That was not the right sort of talk. All sincerity\r\nwas an imprudence. Yet one could not renounce truth altogether, he\r\nthought, with despair. Peter Ivanovitch, meditating behind his dark\r\nglasses, became to him suddenly so odious that if he had had a knife, he\r\nfancied he could have stabbed him not only without compunction, but\r\nwith a horrible, triumphant satisfaction. His imagination dwelt on\r\nthat atrocity in spite of himself. It was as if he were becoming\r\nlight-headed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not what is expected of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not what is--I could get away by breaking the fastening\r\non the little gate I see there in the back wall. It is a flimsy lock.\r\nNobody in the house seems to know he is here with me. Oh yes. The hat!\r\nThese women would discover presently the hat he has left on the landing.\r\nThey would come upon him, lying dead in this damp, gloomy shade--but I\r\nwould be gone and no one could ever...Lord! Am I going mad?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nhimself in a fright.\r\n\r\nThe great man was heard--musing in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m, yes! That--no doubt--in a certain sense....\xe2\x80\x9d He raised his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a deal of pride about you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe intonation of Peter Ivanovitch took on a homely, familiar ring,\r\nacknowledging, in a way, Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s claim to peasant descent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal of pride, brother Kirylo. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that you have no\r\njustification for it. I have admitted you had. I have ventured to allude\r\nto the facts of your birth simply because I attach no mean importance\r\nto it. You are one of us--_un des notres_. I reflect on that with\r\nsatisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI attach some importance to it also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven deny that it may have some importance for you too,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nafter a slight pause and with a touch of grimness of which he was\r\nhimself aware, with some annoyance. He hoped it had escaped the\r\nperception of Peter Ivanovitch. \xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose we talk no more about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall not--not after this one time, Kirylo Sidorovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n persisted the noble arch-priest of Revolution. \xe2\x80\x9cThis shall be the last\r\noccasion. You cannot believe for a moment that I had the slightest idea\r\nof wounding your feelings. You are clearly a superior nature--that\xe2\x80\x99s how\r\nI read you. Quite above the common--h\xe2\x80\x99m--susceptibilities. But the fact\r\nis, Kirylo Sidorovitch, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your susceptibilities. Nobody, out\r\nof Russia, knows much of you--as yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been watching me?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great man had spoken in a tone of perfect frankness, but as they\r\nturned their faces to each other Razumov felt baffled by the dark\r\nspectacles. Under their cover, Peter Ivanovitch hinted that he had felt\r\nfor some time the need of meeting a man of energy and character, in view\r\nof a certain project. He said nothing more precise, however; and after\r\nsome critical remarks upon the personalities of the various members\r\nof the committee of revolutionary action in Stuttgart, he let the\r\nconversation lapse for quite a long while. They paced the alley from end\r\nto end. Razumov, silent too, raised his eyes from time to time to cast a\r\nglance at the back of the house. It offered no sign of being inhabited.\r\nWith its grimy, weather-stained walls and all the windows shuttered from\r\ntop to bottom, it looked damp and gloomy and deserted. It might very\r\nwell have been haunted in traditional style by some doleful, groaning,\r\nfutile ghost of a middle-class order. The shades evoked, as worldly\r\nrumour had it, by Madame de S-- to meet statesmen, diplomatists,\r\ndeputies of various European Parliaments, must have been of another\r\nsort. Razumov had never seen Madame de S-- but in the carriage.\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch came out of his abstraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo things I may say to you at once. I believe, first, that neither a\r\nleader nor any decisive action can come out of the dregs of a people.\r\nNow, if you ask me what are the dregs of a people--h\xe2\x80\x99m--it would take\r\ntoo long to tell. You would be surprised at the variety of ingredients\r\nthat for me go to the making up of these dregs--of that which ought,\r\n_must_ remain at the bottom. Moreover, such a statement might be subject\r\nto discussion. But I can tell you what is _not_ the dregs. On that it\r\nis impossible for us to disagree. The peasantry of a people is not the\r\ndregs; neither is its highest class--well--the nobility. Reflect on\r\nthat, Kirylo Sidorovitch! I believe you are well fitted for reflection.\r\nEverything in a people that is not genuine, not its own by origin or\r\ndevelopment, is--well--dirt! Intelligence in the wrong place is that.\r\nForeign-bred doctrines are that. Dirt! Dregs! The second thing I would\r\noffer to your meditation is this: that for us at this moment there yawns\r\na chasm between the past and the future. It can never be bridged by\r\nforeign liberalism. All attempts at it are either folly or cheating.\r\nBridged it can never be! It has to be filled up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sort of sinister jocularity had crept into the tones of the burly\r\nfeminist. He seized Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s arm above the elbow, and gave it a slight\r\nshake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand, enigmatical young man? It has got to be just filled\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov kept an unmoved countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think that I have already gone beyond meditation on that\r\nsubject?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, freeing his arm by a quiet movement which increased\r\nthe distance a little between himself and Peter Ivanovitch, as they went\r\non strolling abreast. And he added that surely whole cartloads of words\r\nand theories could never fill that chasm. No meditation was necessary.\r\nA sacrifice of many lives could alone--He fell silent without finishing\r\nthe phrase.\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch inclined his big hairy head slowly. After a moment he\r\nproposed that they should go and see if Madame de S-- was now visible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall get some tea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning out of the shaded gloomy walk\r\nwith a brisker step.\r\n\r\nThe lady companion had been on the look out. Her dark skirt whisked into\r\nthe doorway as the two men came in sight round the corner. She ran off\r\nsomewhere altogether, and had disappeared when they entered the hall. In\r\nthe crude light falling from the dusty glass skylight upon the black\r\nand white tessellated floor, covered with muddy tracks, their footsteps\r\nechoed faintly. The great feminist led the way up the stairs. On the\r\nbalustrade of the first-floor landing a shiny tall hat reposed, rim\r\nupwards, opposite the double door of the drawing-room, haunted, it\r\nwas said, by evoked ghosts, and frequented, it was to be supposed, by\r\nfugitive revolutionists. The cracked white paint of the panels, the\r\ntarnished gilt of the mouldings, permitted one to imagine nothing but\r\ndust and emptiness within. Before turning the massive brass handle,\r\nPeter Ivanovitch gave his young companion a sharp, partly critical,\r\npartly preparatory glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one is perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured discreetly. Thus, the possessor of a\r\nrare jewel might, before opening the casket, warn the profane that no\r\ngem perhaps is flawless.\r\n\r\nHe remained with his hand on the door-handle so long that Razumov\r\nassented by a moody \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfection itself would not produce that effect,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Peter\r\nIvanovitch, \xe2\x80\x9cin a world not meant for it. But you shall find there a\r\nmind--no!--the quintessence of feminine intuition which will understand\r\nany perplexity you may be suffering from by the irresistible,\r\nenlightening force of sympathy. Nothing can remain obscure before\r\nthat--that--inspired, yes, inspired penetration, this true light of\r\nfemininity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gaze of the dark spectacles in its glossy steadfastness gave his\r\nface an air of absolute conviction. Razumov felt a momentary shrinking\r\nbefore that closed door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPenetration? Light,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered out. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean some sort of\r\nthought-reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch seemed shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean something utterly different,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, with a faint, pitying\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nRazumov began to feel angry, very much against his wish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very mysterious,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered through his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t object to being understood, to being guided?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the\r\ngreat feminist. Razumov exploded in a fierce whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what sense? Be pleased to understand that I am a serious person. Who\r\ndo you take me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other very closely. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s temper was cooled\r\nby the impenetrable earnestness of the blue glasses meeting his stare.\r\nPeter Ivanovitch turned the handle at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know directly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pushing the door open.\r\n\r\nA low-pitched grating voice was heard within the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Enfin_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the doorway, his black-coated bulk blocking the view, Peter\r\nIvanovitch boomed in a hearty tone with something boastful in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Here I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced over his shoulder at Razumov, who waited for him to move on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am bringing you a proved conspirator--a real one this time. _Un\r\nvrai celui la_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis pause in the doorway gave the \xe2\x80\x9cproved conspirator\xe2\x80\x9d time to make\r\nsure that his face did not betray his angry curiosity and his mental\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nThese sentiments stand confessed in Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum of\r\nhis first interview with Madame de S--. The very words I use in my\r\nnarrative are written where their sincerity cannot be suspected. The\r\nrecord, which could not have been meant for anyone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes but his own,\r\nwas not, I think, the outcome of that strange impulse of indiscretion\r\ncommon to men who lead secret lives, and accounting for the invariable\r\nexistence of \xe2\x80\x9ccompromising documents\xe2\x80\x9d in all the plots and conspiracies\r\nof history. Mr. Razumov looked at it, I suppose, as a man looks at\r\nhimself in a mirror, with wonder, perhaps with anguish, with anger or\r\ndespair. Yes, as a threatened man may look fearfully at his own face in\r\nthe glass, formulating to himself reassuring excuses for his appearance\r\nmarked by the taint of some insidious hereditary disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egeria of the \xe2\x80\x9cRussian Mazzini\xe2\x80\x9d produced, at first view, a strong\r\neffect by the death-like immobility of an obviously painted face. The\r\neyes appeared extraordinarily brilliant. The figure, in a close-fitting\r\ndress, admirably made, but by no means fresh, had an elegant stiffness.\r\nThe rasping voice inviting him to sit down; the rigidity of the upright\r\nattitude with one arm extended along the back of the sofa, the white\r\ngleam of the big eyeballs setting off the black, fathomless stare of the\r\nenlarged pupils, impressed Razumov more than anything he had seen since\r\nhis hasty and secret departure from St. Petersburg. A witch in Parisian\r\nclothes, he thought. A portent! He actually hesitated in his advance,\r\nand did not even comprehend, at first, what the rasping voice was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down. Draw your chair nearer me. There--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down. At close quarters the rouged cheekbones, the wrinkles, the\r\nfine lines on each side of the vivid lips, astounded him. He was being\r\nreceived graciously, with a smile which made him think of a grinning\r\nskull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been hearing about you for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to say, and murmured some disconnected words. The\r\ngrinning skull effect vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know that the general complaint is that you have shown\r\nyourself very reserved everywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov remained silent for a time, thinking of his answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, am a man of action,\xe2\x80\x9d he said huskily, glancing\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch stood in portentous expectant silence by the side of\r\nhis chair. A slight feeling of nausea came over Razumov. What could be\r\nthe relations of these two people to each other? She like a galvanized\r\ncorpse out of some Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s Tale--he the preacher of feminist gospel\r\nfor all the world, and a super-revolutionist besides! This ancient,\r\npainted mummy with unfathomable eyes, and this burly, bull-necked,\r\ndeferential...what was it? Witchcraft, fascination.... \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nher money,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has millions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe walls, the floor of the room were bare like a barn. The few pieces\r\nof furniture had been discovered in the garrets and dragged down into\r\nservice without having been properly dusted, even. It was the refuse the\r\nbanker\xe2\x80\x99s widow had left behind her. The windows without curtains had an\r\nindigent, sleepless look. In two of them the dirty yellowy-white blinds\r\nhad been pulled down. All this spoke, not of poverty, but of sordid\r\npenuriousness.\r\n\r\nThe hoarse voice on the sofa uttered angrily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are looking round, Kirylo Sidorovitch. I have been shamefully\r\nrobbed, positively ruined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA rattling laugh, which seemed beyond her control, interrupted her for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA slavish nature would find consolation in the fact that the principal\r\nrobber was an exalted and almost a sacrosanct person--a Grand Duke, in\r\nfact. Do you understand, Mr. Razumov? A Grand Duke--No! You have no idea\r\nwhat thieves those people are! Downright thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer bosom heaved, but her left arm remained rigidly extended along the\r\nback of the couch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will only upset yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed out a deep voice, which, to\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s startled glance, seemed to proceed from under the steady\r\nspectacles of Peter Ivanovitch, rather than from his lips, which had\r\nhardly moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of hat? I say thieves! _Voleurs! Voleurs!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov was quite confounded by this unexpected clamour, which had in\r\nit something of wailing and croaking, and more than a suspicion of\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Voleurs! Voleurs! Vol_....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo power on earth can rob you of your genius,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Peter Ivanovitch\r\nin an overpowering bass, but without stirring, without a gesture of any\r\nkind. A profound silence fell.\r\n\r\nRazumov remained outwardly impassive. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of this\r\nperformance?\xe2\x80\x9d he was asking himself. But with a preliminary sound\r\nof bumping outside some door behind him, the lady companion, in a\r\nthreadbare black skirt and frayed blouse, came in rapidly, walking on\r\nher heels, and carrying in both hands a big Russian samovar, obviously\r\ntoo heavy for her. Razumov made an instinctive movement to help, which\r\nstartled her so much that she nearly dropped her hissing burden. She\r\nmanaged, however, to land it on the table, and looked so frightened that\r\nRazumov hastened to sit down. She produced then, from an adjacent room,\r\nfour glass tumblers, a teapot, and a sugar-basin, on a black iron tray.\r\n\r\nThe rasping voice asked from the sofa abruptly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Les gateaux_? Have you remembered to bring the cakes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch, without a word, marched out on to the landing, and\r\nreturned instantly with a parcel wrapped up in white glazed paper, which\r\nhe must have extracted from the interior of his hat. With imperturbable\r\ngravity he undid the string and smoothed the paper open on a part of the\r\ntable within reach of Madame de S--\xe2\x80\x98s hand. The lady companion poured\r\nout the tea, then retired into a distant corner out of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsight. From time to time Madame de S-- extended a claw-like hand,\r\nglittering with costly rings, towards the paper of cakes, took up one\r\nand devoured it, displaying her big false teeth ghoulishly. Meantime she\r\ntalked in a hoarse tone of the political situation in the Balkans. She\r\nbuilt great hopes on some complication in the peninsula for arousing\r\na great movement of national indignation in Russia against \xe2\x80\x9cthese\r\nthieves--thieves thieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will only upset yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Ivanovitch interposed, raising\r\nhis glassy gaze. He smoked cigarettes and drank tea in silence,\r\ncontinuously. When he had finished a glass, he flourished his hand\r\nabove his shoulder. At that signal the lady companion, ensconced in her\r\ncorner, with round eyes like a watchful animal, would dart out to the\r\ntable and pour him out another tumblerful.\r\n\r\nRazumov looked at her once or twice. She was anxious, tremulous, though\r\nneither Madame de S-- nor Peter Ivanovitch paid the slightest attention\r\nto her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have they done between them to that forlorn creature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumov asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHave they terrified her out of her senses with\r\nghosts, or simply have they only been beating her?\xe2\x80\x9d When she gave him\r\nhis second glass of tea, he noticed that her lips trembled in the manner\r\nof a scared person about to burst into speech. But of course she said\r\nnothing, and retired into her corner, as if hugging to herself the smile\r\nof thanks he gave her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may be worth cultivating,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe was calming down, getting hold of the actuality into which he had\r\nbeen thrown--for the first time perhaps since Victor Haldin had entered\r\nhis room...and had gone out again. He was distinctly aware of being\r\nthe object of the famous--or notorious--Madame de S--\xe2\x80\x98s ghastly\r\ngraciousness.\r\n\r\nMadame de S-- was pleased to discover that this young man was different\r\nfrom the other types of revolutionist members of committees, secret\r\nemissaries, vulgar and unmannerly fugitive professors, rough students,\r\nex-cobblers with apostolic faces, consumptive and ragged enthusiasts,\r\nHebrew youths, common fellows of all sorts that used to come and go\r\naround Peter Ivanovitch--fanatics, pedants, proletarians all. It was\r\npleasant to talk to this young man of notably good appearance--for\r\nMadame de S-- was not always in a mystical state of mind. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaciturnity only excited her to a quicker, more voluble utterance. It\r\nstill dealt with the Balkans. She knew all the statesmen of that region,\r\nTurks, Bulgarians, Montenegrins, Roumanians, Greeks, Armenians, and\r\nnondescripts, young and old, the living and the dead. With some money an\r\nintrigue could be started which would set the Peninsula in a blaze and\r\noutrage the sentiment of the Russian people. A cry of abandoned brothers\r\ncould be raised, and then, with the nation seething with indignation, a\r\ncouple of regiments or so would be enough to begin a military revolution\r\nin St. Petersburg and make an end of these thieves....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApparently I\xe2\x80\x99ve got only to sit still and listen,\xe2\x80\x9d the silent Razumov\r\nthought to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to that hairy and obscene brute\xe2\x80\x9d (in such terms\r\ndid Mr. Razumov refer mentally to the popular expounder of a feministic\r\nconception of social state), \xe2\x80\x9cas to him, for all his cunning he too\r\nshall speak out some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov ceased to think for a moment. Then a sombre-toned reflection\r\nformulated itself in his mind, ironical and bitter. \xe2\x80\x9cI have the gift of\r\ninspiring confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d He heard himself laughing aloud. It was like a\r\ngoad to the painted, shiny-eyed harridan on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may well laugh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else can one do!\r\nPerfect swindlers--and what base swindlers at that! Cheap\r\nGermans--Holstein-Gottorps! Though, indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly safe to say who\r\nand what they are. A family that counts a creature like Catherine the\r\nGreat in its ancestry--you understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are only upsetting yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Ivanovitch, patiently but\r\nin a firm tone. This admonition had its usual effect on the Egeria. She\r\ndropped her thick, discoloured eyelids and changed her position on the\r\nsofa. All her angular and lifeless movements seemed completely automatic\r\nnow that her eyes were closed. Presently she opened them very full.\r\nPeter Ivanovitch drank tea steadily, without haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I declare!\xe2\x80\x9d She addressed Razumov directly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people who have\r\nseen you on your way here are right. You are very reserved. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsaid twenty words altogether since you came in. You let nothing of your\r\nthoughts be seen in your face either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been listening, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov, using French for the\r\nfirst time, hesitatingly, not being certain of his accent. But it seemed\r\nto produce an excellent impression. Madame de S-- looked meaningly into\r\nPeter Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles, as if to convey her conviction of this\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s merit. She even nodded the least bit in his direction, and\r\nRazumov heard her murmur under her breath the words, \xe2\x80\x9cLater on in\r\nthe diplomatic service,\xe2\x80\x9d which could not but refer to the favourable\r\nimpression he had made. The fantastic absurdity of it revolted him\r\nbecause it seemed to outrage his ruined hopes with the vision of a\r\nmock-career. Peter Ivanovitch, impassive as though he were deaf, drank\r\nsome more tea. Razumov felt that he must say something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he began deliberately, as if uttering a meditated opinion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClearly. Even in planning a purely military revolution the temper of\r\nthe people should be taken into account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have understood me perfectly. The discontent should be\r\nspiritualized. That is what the ordinary heads of revolutionary\r\ncommittees will not understand. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t capable of it. For instance,\r\nMordatiev was in Geneva last month. Peter Ivanovitch brought him here.\r\nYou know Mordatiev? Well, yes--you have heard of him. They call him\r\nan eagle--a hero! He has never done half as much as you have. Never\r\nattempted--not half....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de S-- agitated herself angularly on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, of course, talked to him. And do you know what he said to me?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have we to do with Balkan intrigues? We must simply extirpate the\r\nscoundrels.\xe2\x80\x99 Extirpate is all very well--but what then? The imbecile!\r\nI screamed at him, \xe2\x80\x98But you must spiritualize--don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nunderstand?--spiritualize the discontent.\xe2\x80\x99...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt nervously in her pocket for a handkerchief; she pressed it to\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpiritualize?\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov interrogatively, watching her heaving\r\nbreast. The long ends of an old black lace scarf she wore over her head\r\nslipped off her shoulders and hung down on each side of her ghastly rosy\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn odious creature,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out again. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine a man who takes five\r\nlumps of sugar in his tea.... Yes, I said spiritualize! How else can\r\nyou make discontent effective and universal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to this, young man.\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Ivanovitch made himself heard\r\nsolemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cEffective and universal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov looked at him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome say hunger will do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I know. Our people are starving in heaps. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nfamine universal. And it is not despair that we want to create. There is\r\nno moral support to be got out of that. It is indignation....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de S-- let her thin, extended arm sink on her knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a Mordatiev,\xe2\x80\x9d began Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBien sur!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame de S--.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough I too am ready to say extirpate, extirpate! But in my ignorance\r\nof political work, permit me to ask: A Balkan--well--intrigue, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat take a very long time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch got up and moved off quietly, to stand with his face to\r\nthe window. Razumov heard a door close; he turned his head and perceived\r\nthat the lady companion had scuttled out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn matters of politics I am a supernaturalist.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de S-- broke\r\nthe silence harshly.\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch moved away from the window and struck Razumov lightly\r\non the shoulder. This was a signal for leaving, but at the same time he\r\naddressed Madame de S-- in a peculiar reminding tone---\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleanor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever it meant, she did not seem to hear him. She leaned back in the\r\ncorner of the sofa like a wooden figure. The immovable peevishness of\r\nthe face, framed in the limp, rusty lace, had a character of cruelty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to extirpating,\xe2\x80\x9d she croaked at the attentive Razumov, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is\r\nonly one class in Russia which must be extirpated. Only one. And that\r\nclass consists of only one family. You understand me? That one family\r\nmust be extirpated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer rigidity was frightful, like the rigor of a corpse galvanized into\r\nharsh speech and glittering stare by the force of murderous hate. The\r\nsight fascinated Razumov--yet he felt more self-possessed than at\r\nany other time since he had entered this weirdly bare room. He was\r\ninterested. But the great feminist by his side again uttered his\r\nappeal--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleanor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe disregarded it. Her carmine lips vaticinated with an extraordinary\r\nrapidity. The liberating spirit would use arms before which rivers would\r\npart like Jordan, and ramparts fall down like the walls of Jericho. The\r\ndeliverance from bondage would be effected by plagues and by signs, by\r\nwonders and by war. The women....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleanor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ceased; she had heard him at last. She pressed her hand to her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Ah yes! That girl--the sister of....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Haldin that she meant. That young girl and her mother had\r\nbeen leading a very retired life. They were provincial ladies--were they\r\nnot? The mother had been very beautiful--traces were left yet. Peter\r\nIvanovitch, when he called there for the first time, was greatly\r\nstruck....But the cold way they received him was really surprising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of our national glories,\xe2\x80\x9d Madams de S-- cried out, with\r\nsudden vehemence. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the world listens to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know these ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov loudly rising from his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying, Kirylo Sidorovitch? I understand that she was\r\ntalking to you here, in the garden, the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov gloomily. Then, with an effort, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nmade herself known to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then ran away from us all,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de S-- continued, with ghastly\r\nvivacity. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter coming to the very door! What a peculiar proceeding!\r\nWell, I have been a shy little provincial girl at one time. Yes,\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x9d (she fell into this familiarity intentionally, with an\r\nappalling grimace of graciousness. Razumov gave a perceptible start),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyes, that\xe2\x80\x99s my origin. A simple provincial family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a marvel,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Ivanovich uttered.\r\n\r\nBut it was to Razumov that she gave her death\xe2\x80\x99s-head smile. Her tone was\r\nquite imperious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must bring the wild young thing here. She is wanted. I reckon upon\r\nyour success--mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not a wild young thing,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumov, in a surly voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then--that\xe2\x80\x99s all the same. She may be one of these young\r\nconceited democrats. Do you know what I think? I think she is very much\r\nlike you in character. There is a smouldering fire of scorn in you. You\r\nare darkly self-sufficient, but I can see your very soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer shiny eyes had a dry, intense stare, which, missing Razumov, gave\r\nhim an absurd notion that she was looking at something which was visible\r\nto her behind him. He cursed himself for an impressionable fool, and\r\nasked with forced calmness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you see? Anything resembling me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved her rigidly set face from left to right, negatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome sort of phantom in my image?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Razumov slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cFor, I\r\nsuppose, a soul when it is seen is just that. A vain thing. There are\r\nphantoms of the living as well as of the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tenseness of Madame de S--\xe2\x80\x98s stare had relaxed, and now she looked\r\nat Razumov in a silence that became disconcerting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI myself have had an experience,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered out, as if compelled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a phantom once.\xe2\x80\x9d The unnaturally red lips moved to frame a\r\nquestion harshly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf a dead person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn enemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hated him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! It was not a woman, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Razumov, his eyes looking straight into the eyes\r\nof Madame de S--. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it have been a woman? And why this\r\nconclusion? Why should I not have been able to hate a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the idea of hating a woman was new to him. At that\r\nmoment he hated Madame de S--. But it was not exactly hate. It was more\r\nlike the abhorrence that may be caused by a wooden or plaster figure of\r\na repulsive kind. She moved no more than if she were such a figure; even\r\nher eyes, whose unwinking stare plunged into his own, though shining,\r\nwere lifeless, as though they were as artificial as her teeth. For the\r\nfirst time Razumov became aware of a faint perfume, but faint as it was\r\nit nauseated him exceedingly. Again Peter Ivanovitch tapped him slightly\r\non the shoulder. Thereupon he bowed, and was about to turn away when\r\nhe received the unexpected favour of a bony, inanimate hand extended to\r\nhim, with the two words in hoarse French--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Au revoir!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed over the skeleton hand and left the room, escorted by the great\r\nman, who made him go out first. The voice from the sofa cried after\r\nthem--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remain here, _Pierre_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, _ma chere amie_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he left the room with Razumov, shutting the door behind him. The\r\nlanding was prolonged into a bare corridor, right and left, desolate\r\nperspectives of white and gold decoration without a strip of carpet. The\r\nvery light, pouring through a large window at the end, seemed dusty; and\r\na solitary speck reposing on the balustrade of white marble--the silk\r\ntop-hat of the great feminist--asserted itself extremely, black and\r\nglossy in all that crude whiteness.\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch escorted the visitor without opening his lips. Even\r\nwhen they had reached the head of the stairs Peter Ivanovitch did not\r\nbreak the silence. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s impulse to continue down the flight and out\r\nof the house without as much as a nod abandoned him suddenly. He stopped\r\non the first step and leaned his back against the wall. Below him the\r\ngreat hall with its chequered floor of black and white seemed absurdly\r\nlarge and like some public place where a great power of resonance awaits\r\nthe provocation of footfalls and voices. As if afraid of awakening the\r\nloud echoes of that empty house, Razumov adopted a low tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really have no mind to turn into a dilettante spiritualist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch shook his head slightly, very serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr spend my time in spiritual ecstasies or sublime meditations upon the\r\ngospel of feminism,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cI made my way here for my share\r\nof action--action, most respected Peter Ivanovitch! It was not the great\r\nEuropean writer who attracted me, here, to this odious town of liberty.\r\nIt was somebody much greater. It was the idea of the chief which\r\nattracted me. There are starving young men in Russia who believe in\r\nyou so much that it seems the only thing that keeps them alive in their\r\nmisery. Think of that, Peter Ivanovitch! No! But only think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great man, thus entreated, perfectly motionless and silent, was the\r\nvery image of patient, placid respectability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of the people. They are brutes,\xe2\x80\x9d added Razumov,\r\nin the same subdued but forcible tone. At this, a protesting murmur\r\nissued from the \xe2\x80\x9cheroic fugitive\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d beard. A murmur of authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay--children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Brutes!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov insisted bluntly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are sound, they are innocent,\xe2\x80\x9d the great man pleaded in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as that goes, a brute is sound enough.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov raised his\r\nvoice at last. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny the natural innocence of a brute.\r\nBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of disputing about names? You just try to give these\r\nchildren the power and stature of men and see what they will be like.\r\nYou just give it to them and see.... But never mind. I tell you,\r\nPeter Ivanovitch, that half a dozen young men do not come together\r\nnowadays in a shabby student\xe2\x80\x99s room without your name being whispered,\r\nnot as a leader of thought, but as a centre of revolutionary\r\nenergies--the centre of action. What else has drawn me near you, do you\r\nthink? It is not what all the world knows of you, surely. It\xe2\x80\x99s precisely\r\nwhat the world at large does not know. I was irresistibly drawn-let us\r\nsay impelled, yes, impelled; or, rather, compelled, driven--driven,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n repented Razumov loudly, and ceased, as if startled by the hollow\r\nreverberation of the word \xe2\x80\x9cdriven\xe2\x80\x9d along two bare corridors and in the\r\ngreat empty hall.\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch did not seem startled in the least. The young man\r\ncould not control a dry, uneasy laugh. The great revolutionist remained\r\nunmoved with an effect of commonplace, homely superiority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov to himself, \xe2\x80\x9che is waiting behind his\r\nspectacles for me to give myself away.\xe2\x80\x9d Then aloud, with a satanic\r\nenjoyment of the scorn prompting him to play with the greatness of the\r\ngreat man--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Peter Ivanovitch, if you only knew the force which drew--no, which\r\n_drove_ me towards you! The irresistible force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not feel any desire to laugh now. This time Peter Ivanovitch\r\nmoved his head sideways, knowingly, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nexpressive movement was almost imperceptible. Razumov went on in secret\r\nderision--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these days you have been trying to read me, Peter Ivanovitch. That\r\nis natural. I have perceived it and I have been frank. Perhaps you may\r\nthink I have not been very expansive? But with a man like you it was not\r\nneeded; it would have looked like an impertinence, perhaps. And besides,\r\nwe Russians are prone to talk too much as a rule. I have always felt\r\nthat. And yet, as a nation, we are dumb. I assure you that I am not\r\nlikely to talk to you so much again--ha! ha!--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, still keeping on the lower step, came a little nearer to the\r\ngreat man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been condescending enough. I quite understood it was to lead\r\nme on. You must render me the justice that I have not tried to please. I\r\nhave been impelled, compelled, or rather sent--let us say sent--towards\r\nyou for a work that no one but myself can do. You would call it a\r\nharmless delusion: a ridiculous delusion at which you don\xe2\x80\x99t even smile.\r\nIt is absurd of me to talk like this, yet some day you shall remember\r\nthese words, I hope. Enough of this. Here I stand before you-confessed!\r\nBut one thing more I must add to complete it: a mere blind tool I can\r\nnever consent to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever acknowledgment Razumov was prepared for, he was not prepared\r\nto have both his hands seized in the great man\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. The swiftness of\r\nthe movement was aggressive enough to startle. The burly feminist could\r\nnot have been quicker had his purpose been to jerk Razumov treacherously\r\nup on the landing and bundle him behind one of the numerous closed\r\ndoors near by. This idea actually occurred to Razumov; his hands being\r\nreleased after a darkly eloquent squeeze, he smiled, with a beating\r\nheart, straight at the beard and the spectacles hiding that impenetrable\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHe thought to himself (it stands confessed in his handwriting), \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmove from here till he either speaks or turns away. This is a duel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Many seconds passed without a sign or sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d the great man said hurriedly, in subdued tones, as if the\r\nwhole thing had been a stolen, breathless interview. \xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Come\r\nto see us here in a few days. This must be gone into deeply--deeply,\r\nbetween you and me. Quite to the bottom. To the...And, by the by,\r\nyou must bring along Natalia Victorovna--you know, the Haldin girl....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to take this as my first instruction from you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Razumov\r\nstiffly.\r\n\r\nPeter Ivanovitch seemed perplexed by this new attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! h\xe2\x80\x99m! You are naturally the proper person--_la personne indiquee_.\r\nEvery one shall be wanted presently. Every one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent down from the landing over Razumov, who had lowered his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moment of action approaches,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nRazumov did not look up. He did not move till he heard the door of the\r\ndrawing-room close behind the greatest of feminists returning to his\r\npainted Egeria. Then he walked down slowly into the hall. The door stood\r\nopen, and the shadow of the house was lying aslant over the greatest\r\npart of the terrace. While crossing it slowly, he lifted his hat and\r\nwiped his damp forehead, expelling his breath with force to get rid of\r\nthe last vestiges of the air he had been breathing inside. He looked at\r\nthe palms of his hands, and rubbed them gently against his thighs.\r\n\r\nHe felt, bizarre as it may seem, as though another self, an independent\r\nsharer of his mind, had been able to view his whole person very\r\ndistinctly indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is curious,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. After a while he\r\nformulated his opinion of it in the mental ejaculation: \xe2\x80\x9cBeastly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n This disgust vanished before a marked uneasiness. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an effect of\r\nnervous exhaustion,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected with weary sagacity. \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to\r\ngo on day after day if I have no more power of resistance--moral\r\nresistance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe followed the path at the foot of the terrace. \xe2\x80\x9cMoral resistance,\r\nmoral resistance;\xe2\x80\x9d he kept on repeating these words mentally. Moral\r\nendurance. Yes, that was the necessity of the situation. An immense\r\nlonging to make his way out of these grounds and to the other end of the\r\ntown, of throwing himself on his bed and going to sleep for hours, swept\r\neverything clean out of his mind for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that I am\r\nbut a weak creature after all?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, in sudden alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cEh!\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a start as if awakened from a dream. He even swayed a little\r\nbefore recovering himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You stole away from us quietly to walk about here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe lady companion stood before him, but how she came there he had not\r\nthe slightest idea. Her folded arms were closely cherishing the cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been unconscious as I walked, it\xe2\x80\x99s a positive fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRazumov to himself in wonder. He raised his hat with marked civility.\r\n\r\nThe sallow woman blushed duskily. She had her invariably scared\r\nexpression, as if somebody had just disclosed to her some terrible news.\r\nBut she held her ground, Razumov noticed, without timidity. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nincredibly shabby,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. In the sunlight her black costume looked\r\ngreenish, with here and there threadbare patches where the stuff seemed\r\ndecomposed by age into a velvety, black, furry state. Her very hair and\r\neyebrows looked shabby. Razumov wondered whether she were sixty years\r\nold. Her figure, though, was young enough. He observed that she did not\r\nappear starved, but rather as if she had been fed on unwholesome scraps\r\nand leavings of plates.\r\n\r\nRazumov smiled amiably and moved out of her way. She turned her head to\r\nkeep her scared eyes on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you have been told in there,\xe2\x80\x9d she affirmed, without\r\npreliminaries. Her tone, in contrast with her manner, had an\r\nunexpectedly assured character which put Razumov at his ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you? You must have heard all sorts of talk on many occasions in\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe varied her phrase, with the same incongruous effect of positiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know to a certainty what you have been told to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov shrugged his shoulders a little. He was about to pass\r\non with a bow, when a sudden thought struck him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. To be sure! In\r\nyour confidential position you are aware of many things,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured,\r\nlooking at the cat.\r\n\r\nThat animal got a momentary convulsive hug from the lady companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything was disclosed to me a long time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov repeated absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch is an awful despot,\xe2\x80\x9d she jerked out.\r\n\r\nRazumov went on studying the stripes on the grey fur of the cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn iron will is an integral part of such a temperament. How else could\r\nhe be a leader? And I think that you are mistaken in--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me that I am mistaken. But I tell you all\r\nthe same that he cares for no one.\xe2\x80\x9d She jerked her head up. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nbring that girl here. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you have been told to do--to bring\r\nthat girl here. Listen to me; you had better tie a stone round her neck\r\nand throw her into the lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had a sensation of chill and gloom, as if a heavy cloud had\r\npassed over the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to do with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have been told to bring Nathalie Haldin here. Am I not right?\r\nOf course I am right. I was not in the room, but I know. I know Peter\r\nIvanovitch sufficiently well. He is a great man. Great men are horrible.\r\nWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Have nothing to do with her. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best you\r\ncan do, unless you want her to become like me--disillusioned!\r\nDisillusioned!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike you,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Razumov, glaring at her face, as devoid of all\r\ncomeliness of feature and complexion as the most miserable beggar is\r\nof money. He smiled, still feeling chilly: a peculiar sensation which\r\nannoyed him. \xe2\x80\x9cDisillusioned as to Peter Ivanovitch! Is that all you have\r\nlost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe declared, looking frightened, but with immense conviction, \xe2\x80\x9cPeter\r\nIvanovitch stands for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added, in another tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep the girl away from this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you absolutely inciting me to disobey Peter Ivanovitch just\r\nbecause--because you are disillusioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to blink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly I saw you for the first time I was comforted. You took your\r\nhat off to me. You looked as if one could trust you. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrank before Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s savage snarl of, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard something\r\nlike this before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so confounded that she could do nothing but blink for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was your humane manner,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained plaintively. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nstarving for, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say kindness, but just for a little civility, for\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long. And now you are angry....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no, on the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you trust me.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible that later on I may...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you were to get ill,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cor meet some\r\nbitter trouble, you would find I am not a useless fool. You have only to\r\nlet me know. I will come to you. I will indeed. And I will stick to you.\r\nMisery and I are old acquaintances--but this life here is worse than\r\nstarving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused anxiously, then in a voice for the first time sounding really\r\ntimid, she added--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr if you were engaged in some dangerous work. Sometimes a humble\r\ncompanion--I would not want to know anything. I would follow you with\r\njoy. I could carry out orders. I have the courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov looked attentively at the scared round eyes, at the withered,\r\nsallow, round cheeks. They were quivering about the corners of the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants to escape from here,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I were to tell you that I am engaged in dangerous work?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nuttered slowly.\r\n\r\nShe pressed the cat to her threadbare bosom with a breathless\r\nexclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Then not much above a whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cUnder Peter\r\nIvanovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not under Peter Ivanovitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read admiration in her eyes, and made an effort to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen--alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held up his closed hand with the index raised. \xe2\x80\x9cLike this finger,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe was trembling slightly. But it occurred to Razumov that they might\r\nhave been observed from the house, and he became anxious to be gone. She\r\nblinked, raising up to him her puckered face, and seemed to beg mutely\r\nto be told something more, to be given a word of encouragement for her\r\nstarving, grotesque, and pathetic devotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we be seen from the house?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Razumov confidentially.\r\n\r\nShe answered, without showing the slightest surprise at the question--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we can\xe2\x80\x99t, on account of this end of the stables.\xe2\x80\x9d And she added,\r\nwith an acuteness which surprised Razumov, \xe2\x80\x9cBut anybody looking out of\r\nan upstairs window would know that you have not passed through the gates\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s likely to spy out of the window?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter\r\nIvanovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he trouble his head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe expects somebody this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s more than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had lowered her eyelids. Razumov looked at her curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. You hear everything they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe murmured without any animosity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do the tables and chairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe understood that the bitterness accumulated in the heart of that\r\nhelpless creature had got into her veins, and, like some subtle poison,\r\nhad decomposed her fidelity to that hateful pair. It was a great piece\r\nof luck for him, he reflected; because women are seldom venal after the\r\nmanner of men, who can be bought for material considerations. She would\r\nbe a good ally, though it was not likely that she was allowed to hear\r\nas much as the tables and chairs of the Chateau Borel. That could not be\r\nexpected. But still.... And, at any rate, she could be made to talk.\r\n\r\nWhen she looked up her eyes met the fixed stare of Razumov, who began to\r\nspeak at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, dear...but upon my word, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the pleasure of\r\nknowing your name yet. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time she made a movement of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it strange? No one is told my name. No one cares. No one talks to\r\nme, no one writes to me. My parents don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if I\xe2\x80\x99m alive. I have\r\nno use for a name, and I have almost forgotten it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov murmured gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but still...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on much slower, with indifference--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may call me Tekla, then. My poor Andrei called me so. I was devoted\r\nto him. He lived in wretchedness and suffering, and died in misery. That\r\nis the lot of all us Russians, nameless Russians. There is nothing else\r\nfor us, and no hope anywhere, unless...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless all these people with names are done away with,\xe2\x80\x9d she finished,\r\nblinking and pursing up her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be easier to call you Tekla, as you direct me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRazumov, \xe2\x80\x9cif you consent to call me Kirylo, when we are talking like\r\nthis--quietly--only you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a being who must be terribly afraid of\r\nthe world, else she would have run away from this situation before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then he reflected that the mere fact of leaving the great man abruptly\r\nwould make her a suspect. She could expect no support or countenance\r\nfrom anyone. This revolutionist was not fit for an independent\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nShe moved with him a few steps, blinking and nursing the cat with a\r\nsmall balancing movement of her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--only you and I. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I was with my poor Andrei, only he was\r\ndying, killed by these official brutes--while you! You are strong. You\r\nkill the monsters. You have done a great deed. Peter Ivanovitch himself\r\nmust consider you. Well--don\xe2\x80\x99t forget me--especially if you are going\r\nback to work in Russia. I could follow you, carrying anything that\r\nwas wanted--at a distance, you know. Or I could watch for hours at the\r\ncorner of a street if necessary,--in wet or snow--yes, I could--all day\r\nlong. Or I could write for you dangerous documents, lists of names or\r\ninstructions, so that in case of mischance the handwriting could not\r\ncompromise you. And you need not be afraid if they were to catch me. I\r\nwould know how to keep dumb. We women are not so easily daunted by pain.\r\nI heard Peter Ivanovitch say it is our blunt nerves or something. We can\r\nstand it better. And it\xe2\x80\x99s true; I would just as soon bite my tongue out\r\nand throw it at them as not. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of speech to me? Who would\r\never want to hear what I could say? Ever since I closed the eyes of my\r\npoor Andrei I haven\xe2\x80\x99t met a man who seemed to care for the sound of\r\nmy voice. I should never have spoken to you if the very first time you\r\nappeared here you had not taken notice of me so nicely. I could not help\r\nspeaking of you to that charming dear girl. Oh, the sweet creature! And\r\nstrong! One can see that at once. If you have a heart don\xe2\x80\x99t let her set\r\nher foot in here. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov caught her by the arm. Her emotion at being thus seized\r\nmanifested itself by a short struggle, after which she stood still, not\r\nlooking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he spoke in her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy they--these people in\r\nthat house there--are so anxious to get hold of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe freed herself to turn upon him, as if made angry by the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you understand that Peter Ivanovitch must direct, inspire,\r\ninfluence? It is the breath of his life. There can never be too many\r\ndisciples. He can\xe2\x80\x99t bear thinking of anyone escaping him. And a woman,\r\ntoo! There is nothing to be done without women, he says. He has written\r\nit. He--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man was staring at her passion when she broke off suddenly and\r\nran away behind the stable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nRazumov, thus left to himself, took the direction of the gate. But on\r\nthis day of many conversations, he discovered that very probably he\r\ncould not leave the grounds without having to hold another one.\r\n\r\nStepping in view from beyond the lodge appeared the expected visitors\r\nof Peter Ivanovitch: a small party composed of two men and a woman. They\r\nnoticed him too, immediately, and stopped short as if to consult. But in\r\na moment the woman, moving aside, motioned with her arm to the two men,\r\nwho, leaving the drive at once, struck across the large neglected\r\nlawn, or rather grass-plot, and made directly for the house. The woman\r\nremained on the path waiting for Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s approach. She had recognized\r\nhim. He, too, had recognized her at the first glance. He had been made\r\nknown to her at Zurich, where he had broken his journey while on his\r\nway from Dresden. They had been much together for the three days of his\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nShe was wearing the very same costume in which he had seen her first. A\r\nblouse of crimson silk made her noticeable at a distance. With that\r\nshe wore a short brown skirt and a leather belt. Her complexion was\r\nthe colour of coffee and milk, but very clear; her eyes black and\r\nglittering, her figure erect. A lot of thick hair, nearly white, was\r\ndone up loosely under a dusty Tyrolese hat of dark cloth, which seemed\r\nto have lost some of its trimmings.\r\n\r\nThe expression of her face was grave, intent; so grave that Razumov,\r\nafter approaching her close, felt obliged to smile. She greeted him with\r\na manly hand-grasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Are you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is that, Razumov?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been asked to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov\r\nanswered, returning the pressure of her hand with much less force than\r\nshe had put into it.\r\n\r\nShe jerked her head sideways like one who understands. Meantime\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had strayed after the two men. They were crossing the\r\ngrass-plot obliquely, without haste. The shorter of the two was buttoned\r\nup in a narrow overcoat of some thin grey material, which came nearly\r\nto his heels. His companion, much taller and broader, wore a short,\r\nclose-fitting jacket and tight trousers tucked into shabby top-boots.\r\n\r\nThe woman, who had sent them out of Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s way apparently, spoke in a\r\nbusinesslike voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to come rushing from Zurich on purpose to meet the train and take\r\nthese two along here to see Peter Ivanovitch. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just managed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov said perfunctorily, and very vexed at her staying\r\nbehind to talk to him \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Zurich--yes, of course. And these two, they\r\ncome from....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted, without emphasis--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom quite another direction. From a distance, too. A considerable\r\ndistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov shrugged his shoulders. The two men from a distance, after\r\nhaving reached the wall of the terrace, disappeared suddenly at its foot\r\nas if the earth had opened to swallow them up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, they have just come from America.\xe2\x80\x9d The woman in the crimson\r\nblouse shrugged her shoulders too a little before making that statement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time is drawing near,\xe2\x80\x9d she interjected, as if speaking to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not tell them who you were. Yakovlitch would have wanted to\r\nembrace you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that he with the wisp of hair hanging from his chin, in the long\r\ncoat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve guessed aright. That\xe2\x80\x99s Yakovlitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they could not find their way here from the station without you\r\ncoming on purpose from Zurich to show it to them? Verily, without women\r\nwe can do nothing. So it stands written, and apparently so it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of an immense lassitude under his effort to be\r\nsarcastic. And he could see that she had detected it with those steady,\r\nbrilliant black eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a devil of a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited, with her black eyes fixed on his face. Then--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of that? You men are so impressionable and self-conscious. One day\r\nis like another, hard, hard--and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it, till the great\r\nday comes. I came over for a very good reason. They wrote to warn Peter\r\nIvanovitch of their arrival. But where from? Only from Cherbourg on a\r\nbit of ship\xe2\x80\x99s notepaper. Anybody could have done that. Yakovlitch has\r\nlived for years and years in America. I am the only one at hand who had\r\nknown him well in the old days. I knew him very well indeed. So Peter\r\nIvanovitch telegraphed, asking me to come. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural enough, is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came to vouch for his identity?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Something of the kind. Fifteen years of a life like his make\r\nchanges in a man. Lonely, like a crow in a strange country. When I think\r\nof Yakovlitch before he went to America--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe softness of the low tone caused Razumov to glance at her sideways.\r\nShe sighed; her black eyes were looking away; she had plunged the\r\nfingers of her right hand deep into the mass of nearly white hair, and\r\nstirred them there absently. When she withdrew her hand the little hat\r\nperched on the top of her head remained slightly tilted, with a queer\r\ninquisitive effect, contrasting strongly with the reminiscent murmur\r\nthat escaped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were not in our first youth even then. But a man is a child always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov thought suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cThey have been living together.\xe2\x80\x9d Then aloud--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you follow him to America?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked point-blank.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with a perturbed air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember what was going on fifteen years ago? It was a time\r\nof activity. The Revolution has its history by this time. You are in\r\nit and yet you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know it. Yakovlitch went away then on a\r\nmission; I went back to Russia. It had to be so. Afterwards there was\r\nnothing for him to come back to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumov, with affected surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you trying to insinuate\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and\r\nwhat then if he did get discouraged a little....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks like a Yankee, with that goatee hanging from his chin. A\r\nregular Uncle Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and you? You who went to\r\nRussia? You did not get discouraged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. Yakovlitch is a man who cannot be doubted. He, at any rate,\r\nis the right sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer black, penetrating gaze remained fixed upon Razumov while she spoke,\r\nand for a moment afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov inquired coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut does it mean that you, for\r\ninstance, think that I am not the right sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no protest, gave no sign of having heard the question;\r\nshe continued looking at him in a manner which he judged not to be\r\nabsolutely unfriendly. In Zurich when he passed through she had taken\r\nhim under her charge, in a way, and was with him from morning till night\r\nduring his stay of two days. She took him round to see several people.\r\nAt first she talked to him a great deal and rather unreservedly, but\r\nalways avoiding all reference to herself; towards the middle of the\r\nsecond day she fell silent, attending him zealously as before, and even\r\nseeing him off at the railway station, where she pressed his hand firmly\r\nthrough the lowered carriage window, and, stepping back without a word,\r\nwaited till the train moved. He had noticed that she was treated with\r\nquiet regard. He knew nothing of her parentage, nothing of her private\r\nhistory or political record; he judged her from his own private point of\r\nview, as being a distinct danger in his path. \xe2\x80\x9cJudged\xe2\x80\x9d is not perhaps\r\nthe right word. It was more of a feeling, the summing up of slight\r\nimpressions aided by the discovery that he could not despise her as he\r\ndespised all the others. He had not expected to see her again so soon.\r\n\r\nNo, decidedly; her expression was not unfriendly. Yet he perceived an\r\nacceleration in the beat of his heart. The conversation could not be\r\nabandoned at that point. He went on in accents of scrupulous inquiry--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it perhaps because I don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to accept blindly every development\r\nof the general doctrine--such for instance as the feminism of our great\r\nPeter Ivanovitch? If that is what makes me suspect, then I can only say\r\nI would scorn to be a slave even to an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been looking at him all the time, not as a listener looks\r\nat one, but as if the words he chose to say were only of secondary\r\ninterest. When he finished she slipped her hand, by a sudden and decided\r\nmovement, under his arm and impelled him gently towards the gate of the\r\ngrounds. He felt her firmness and obeyed the impulsion at once, just as\r\nthe other two men had, a moment before, obeyed unquestioningly the wave\r\nof her hand.\r\n\r\nThey made a few steps like this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Razumov, your ideas are probably all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be\r\nvaluable--very valuable. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe released him. He met her with a frosty smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I expected then to have love as well as convictions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know very well what I mean. People have been thinking you not quite\r\nwhole-hearted. I have heard that opinion from one side and another. But\r\nI have understood you at the end of the first day....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov interrupted her, speaking steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you that your perspicacity is at fault here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat phrases he uses!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed parenthetically. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Kirylo\r\nSidorovitch, you like other men are fastidious, full of self-love and\r\nafraid of trifles. Moreover, you had no training. What you want is to\r\nbe taken in hand by some woman. I am sorry I am not staying here a few\r\ndays. I am going back to Zurich to-morrow, and shall take Yakovlitch\r\nwith me most likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis information relieved Razumov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, all the same, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nunderstand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe breathed more freely; she did not protest, but asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did\r\nyou get on with Peter Ivanovitch? You have seen a good deal of each\r\nother. How is it between you two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot knowing what answer to make, the young man inclined his head slowly.\r\n\r\nHer lips had been parted in expectation. She pressed them together, and\r\nseemed to reflect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis had a sound of finality, but she did not leave him. It was\r\nimpossible to guess what she had in her mind. Razumov muttered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not of me that you should have asked that question. In a moment\r\nyou shall see Peter Ivanovitch himself, and the subject will come up\r\nnaturally. He will be curious to know what has delayed you so long in\r\nthis garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt Peter Ivanovitch will have something to say to me. Several\r\nthings. He may even speak of you--question me. Peter Ivanovitch is\r\ninclined to trust me generally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion you? That\xe2\x80\x99s very likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, half serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--and what shall I say to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You may tell him of your discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--my lack of love for....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! That\xe2\x80\x99s between ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, it was hard to say\r\nwhether in jest or earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you want to tell Peter Ivanovitch something in my favour,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Razumov, with grim playfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you can tell him that\r\nI am very much in earnest about my mission. I mean to succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been given a mission!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt amounts to that. I have been told to bring about a certain event.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him searchingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mission,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, very grave and interested all at once. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nsort of mission?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething in the nature of propaganda work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Far away from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not very far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov, restraining a sudden desire to laugh,\r\nalthough he did not feel joyous in the least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am not asking questions. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsufficient that Peter Ivanovitch should know what each of us is doing.\r\nEverything is bound to come right in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think, young man. I just simply believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it to Peter Ivanovitch that you owe that faith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer the question, and they stood idle, silent, as if\r\nreluctant to part with each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just like a man,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured at last. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if it were possible\r\nto tell how a belief comes to one.\xe2\x80\x9d Her thin Mephistophelian eyebrows\r\nmoved a little. \xe2\x80\x9cTruly there are millions of people in Russia who would\r\nenvy the life of dogs in this country. It is a horror and a shame to\r\nconfess this even between ourselves. One must believe for very pity.\r\nThis can\xe2\x80\x99t go on. No! It can\xe2\x80\x99t go on. For twenty years I have been\r\ncoming and going, looking neither to the left nor to the right....\r\nWhat are you smiling to yourself for? You are only at the beginning. You\r\nhave begun well, but you just wait till you have trodden every particle\r\nof yourself under your feet in your comings and goings. For that is\r\nwhat it comes to. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to trample down every particle of your own\r\nfeelings; for stop you cannot, you must not. I have been young, too--but\r\nperhaps you think that I am complaining-eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Razumov indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you dear superior creature. You don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe plunged her fingers into the bunch of hair on the left side,\r\nand that brusque movement had the effect of setting the Tyrolese hat\r\nstraight on her head. She frowned under it without animosity, in the\r\nmanner of an investigator. Razumov averted his face carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou men are all alike. You mistake luck for merit. You do it in good\r\nfaith too! I would not be too hard on you. It\xe2\x80\x99s masculine nature.\r\nYou men are ridiculously pitiful in your aptitude to cherish childish\r\nillusions down to the very grave. There are a lot of us who have been at\r\nwork for fifteen years--I mean constantly--trying one way after another,\r\nunderground and above ground, looking neither to the right nor to the\r\nleft! I can talk about it. I have been one of these that never\r\nrested.... There! What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking.... Look at my grey hairs!\r\nAnd here two babies come along--I mean you and Haldin--you come along\r\nand manage to strike a blow at the very first try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the name of Haldin falling from the rapid and energetic lips of the\r\nwoman revolutionist, Razumov had the usual brusque consciousness of the\r\nirrevocable. But in all the months which had passed over his head he\r\nhad become hardened to the experience. The consciousness was no longer\r\naccompanied by the blank dismay and the blind anger of the early days.\r\nHe had argued himself into new beliefs; and he had made for himself a\r\nmental atmosphere of gloomy and sardonic reverie, a sort of murky\r\nmedium through which the event appeared like a featureless shadow having\r\nvaguely the shape of a man; a shape extremely familiar, yet utterly\r\ninexpressive, except for its air of discreet waiting in the dusk. It was\r\nnot alarming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he like?\xe2\x80\x9d the woman revolutionist asked unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he like?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Razumov, making a painful effort not to turn\r\nupon her savagely. But he relieved himself by laughing a little while he\r\nstole a glance at her out of the corners of his eyes. This reception of\r\nher inquiry disturbed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow like a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the good of concerning yourself\r\nwith his appearance? Whatever it was, he is removed beyond all feminine\r\ninfluences now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA frown, making three folds at the root of her nose, accentuated the\r\nMephistophelian slant of her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou suffer, Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested, in her low, confident voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov faced the woman fairly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now I think of it,\r\nI am not sure that he is beyond the influence of one woman at least; the\r\none over there--Madame de S--, you know. Formerly the dead were allowed\r\nto rest, but now it seems they are at the beck and call of a crazy old\r\nharridan. We revolutionists make wonderful discoveries. It is true that\r\nthey are not exactly our own. We have nothing of our own. But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe friend of Peter Ivanovitch satisfy your feminine curiosity? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe conjure him up for you?\xe2\x80\x9d--he jested like a man in pain.\r\n\r\nHer concentrated frowning expression relaxed, and she said, a little\r\nwearily, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us hope she will make an effort and conjure up some tea\r\nfor us. But that is by no means certain. I am tired, Razumov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tired! What a confession! Well, there has been tea up there. I had\r\nsome. If you hurry on after Yakovlitch, instead of wasting your time\r\nwith such an unsatisfactory sceptical person as myself, you may find the\r\nghost of it--the cold ghost of it--still lingering in the temple. But as\r\nto you being tired I can hardly believe it. We are not supposed to be.\r\nWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t, We can\xe2\x80\x99t. The other day I read in some paper or other an\r\nalarmist article on the tireless activity of the revolutionary parties.\r\nIt impresses the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s our prestige.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe flings out continually these flouts and sneers;\xe2\x80\x9d the woman in the\r\ncrimson blouse spoke as if appealing quietly to a third person, but\r\nher black eyes never left Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what for, pray? Simply\r\nbecause some of his conventional notions are shocked, some of his\r\npetty masculine standards. You might think he was one of these nervous\r\nsensitives that come to a bad end. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, after a short,\r\nreflective pause and changing the mode of her address, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet I\r\nhave just learned something which makes me think that you are a man of\r\ncharacter, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Yes! indeed--you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mysterious positiveness of this assertion startled Razumov. Their\r\neyes met. He looked away and, through the bars of the rusty gate, stared\r\nat the clean, wide road shaded by the leafy trees. An electric tramcar,\r\nquite empty, ran along the avenue with a metallic rustle. It seemed to\r\nhim he would have given anything to be sitting inside all alone. He\r\nwas inexpressibly weary, weary in every fibre of his body, but he had\r\na reason for not being the first to break off the conversation. At any\r\ninstant, in the visionary and criminal babble of revolutionists, some\r\nmomentous words might fall on his ear; from her lips, from anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips. As long as he managed to preserve a clear mind and to keep down\r\nhis irritability there was nothing to fear. The only condition of\r\nsuccess and safety was indomitable will-power, he reminded himself.\r\n\r\nHe longed to be on the other side of the bars, as though he were\r\nactually a prisoner within the grounds of this centre of revolutionary\r\nplots, of this house of folly, of blindness, of villainy and crime.\r\nSilently he indulged his wounded spirit in a feeling of immense moral\r\nand mental remoteness. He did not even smile when he heard her repeat\r\nthe words--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! A strong character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to gaze through the bars like a moody prisoner, not\r\nthinking of escape, but merely pondering upon the faded memories of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t look out,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled, still looking away, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall\r\ncertainly miss seeing as much as the mere ghost of that tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not to be shaken off in such a way. As a matter of fact he had\r\nnot expected to succeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, it will be no great loss. I mean the missing of her tea and\r\nonly the ghost of it at that. As to the lady, you must understand that\r\nshe has her positive uses. See _that_, Razumov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his head at this imperative appeal and saw the woman\r\nrevolutionist making the motions of counting money into the palm of her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. You see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov uttered a slow \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d and returned to his prisoner-like gazing\r\nupon the neat and shady road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaterial means must be obtained in some way, and this is easier than\r\nbreaking into banks. More certain too. There! I am joking.... What is\r\nhe muttering to himself now?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried under her breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy admiration of Peter Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s devoted self-sacrifice, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make one sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you squeamish, masculine creature. Sick! Makes him sick! And what\r\ndo you know of the truth of it? There\xe2\x80\x99s no looking into the secrets of\r\nthe heart. Peter Ivanovitch knew her years ago, in his worldly days,\r\nwhen he was a young officer in the Guards. It is not for us to judge\r\nan inspired person. That\xe2\x80\x99s where you men have an advantage. You are\r\ninspired sometimes both in thought and action. I have always admitted\r\nthat when you _are_ inspired, when you manage to throw off your\r\nmasculine cowardice and prudishness you are not to be equalled by us.\r\nOnly, how seldom.... Whereas the silliest woman can always be made\r\nof use. And why? Because we have passion, unappeasable passion.... I\r\nshould like to know what he is smiling at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not smiling,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Razumov gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! How is one to call it? You made some sort of face. Yes, I know!\r\nYou men can love here and hate there and desire something or other--and\r\nyou make a great to-do about it, and you call it passion! Yes! While\r\nit lasts. But we women are in love with love, and with hate, with these\r\nvery things I tell you, and with desire itself. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nbribed off so easily as you men. In life, you see, there is not much\r\nchoice. You have either to rot or to burn. And there is not one of us,\r\npainted or unpainted, that would not rather burn than rot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with energy, but in a matter-of-fact tone. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nhad wandered away on a track of its own--outside the bars of the\r\ngate--but not out of earshot. He stuck his hands into the pockets of his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot or burn! Powerfully stated. Painted or unpainted. Very vigorous.\r\nPainted or...Do tell me--she would be infernally jealous of him,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? What? The Baroness? Eleanor Maximovna? Jealous of Peter\r\nIvanovitch? Heavens! Are these the questions the man\xe2\x80\x99s mind is running\r\non? Such a thing is not to be thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Can\xe2\x80\x99t a wealthy old woman be jealous? Or, are they all pure\r\nspirits together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what put it into your head to ask such a question?\xe2\x80\x9d she wondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I just asked. Masculine frivolity, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted at once. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the time to be\r\nfrivolous. What are you flinging your very heart against? Or, perhaps,\r\nyou are only playing a part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had felt that woman\xe2\x80\x99s observation of him like a physical\r\ncontact, like a hand resting lightly on his shoulder. At that moment he\r\nreceived the mysterious impression of her having made up her mind for a\r\ncloser grip. He stiffened himself inwardly to bear it without betraying\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlaying a Part,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, presenting to her an unmoved profile. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmust be done very badly since you see through the assumption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe watched him, her forehead drawn into perpendicular folds, the thin\r\nblack eyebrows diverging upwards like the antennae of an insect. He\r\nadded hardly audibly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken. I am doing it no more than the rest of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is doing it?\xe2\x80\x9d she snapped out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a materialist, aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! My dear soul, I have outlived all that nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must remember the definition of Cabanis: \xe2\x80\x98Man is a digestive\r\ntube.\xe2\x80\x99 I imagine now....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spit on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? On Cabanis? All right. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore the importance of a\r\ngood digestion. The joy of life--you know the joy of life?--depends on\r\na sound stomach, whereas a bad digestion inclines one to scepticism,\r\nbreeds black fancies and thoughts of death. These are facts ascertained\r\nby physiologists. Well, I assure you that ever since I came over from\r\nRussia I have been stuffed with indigestible foreign concoctions of the\r\nmost nauseating kind--pah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are joking,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured incredulously. He assented in a detached\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It is all a joke. It\xe2\x80\x99s hardly worth while talking to a man like\r\nme. Yet for that very reason men have been known to take their own\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I think it is worth while talking to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kept her in the corner of his eye. She seemed to be thinking out some\r\nscathing retort, but ended by only shrugging her shoulders slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShallow talk! I suppose one must pardon this weakness in you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, putting a special accent on the last word. There was something\r\nanxious in her indulgent conclusion.\r\n\r\nRazumov noted the slightest shades in this conversation, which he had\r\nnot expected, for which he was not prepared. That was it. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not\r\nprepared,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has taken me unawares.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to\r\nhim that if he only could allow himself to pant openly like a dog for a\r\ntime this oppression would pass away. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never be found prepared,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he thought, with despair. He laughed a little, saying as lightly as he\r\ncould--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d Then affecting a playful uneasiness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid Peter Ivanovitch might suspect us of plotting\r\nsomething unauthorized together by the gate here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not afraid. You are quite safe from suspicions while you are\r\nwith me, my dear young man.\xe2\x80\x9d The humorous gleam in her black eyes went\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch trusts me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, quite austerely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ntakes my advice. I am his right hand, as it were, in certain most\r\nimportant things.... That amuses you what? Do you think I am\r\nboasting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid. I was just only saying to myself that Peter Ivanovitch\r\nseems to have solved the woman question pretty completely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke he reproached himself for his words, for his tone. All\r\nday long he had been saying the wrong things. It was folly, worse than\r\nfolly. It was weakness; it was this disease of perversity overcoming his\r\nwill. Was this the way to meet speeches which certainly contained the\r\npromise of future confidences from that woman who apparently had a\r\ngreat store of secret knowledge and so much influence? Why give her this\r\npuzzling impression? But she did not seem inimical. There was no anger\r\nin her voice. It was strangely speculative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne does not know what to think, Razumov. You must have bitten\r\nsomething bitter in your cradle.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov gave her a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! Something bitter? That\xe2\x80\x99s an explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly it\r\nwas much later. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Sophia Antonovna, that you and I\r\ncome from the same cradle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman, whose name he had forced himself at last to pronounce (he had\r\nexperienced a strong repugnance in letting it pass his lips), the woman\r\nrevolutionist murmured, after a pause--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean--Russia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe disdained even to nod. She seemed softened, her black eyes very\r\nstill, as though she were pursuing the simile in her thoughts to all\r\nits tender associations. But suddenly she knitted her brows in a\r\nMephistophelian frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Perhaps no wonder, then. Yes. One lies there lapped up in evils,\r\nwatched over by beings that are worse than ogres, ghouls, and vampires.\r\nThey must be driven away, destroyed utterly. In regard of that task\r\nnothing else matters if men and women are determined and faithful.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how I came to feel in the end. The great thing is not to quarrel\r\namongst ourselves about all sorts of conventional trifles. Remember\r\nthat, Razumov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov was not listening. He had even lost the sense of being watched\r\nin a sort of heavy tranquillity. His uneasiness, his exasperation, his\r\nscorn were blunted at last by all these trying hours. It seemed to him\r\nthat now they were blunted for ever. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a match for them all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he thought, with a conviction too firm to be exulting. The woman\r\nrevolutionist had ceased speaking; he was not looking at her; there was\r\nno one passing along the road. He almost forgot that he was not alone.\r\nHe heard her voice again, curt, businesslike, and yet betraying the\r\nhesitation which had been the real reason of her prolonged silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Razumov!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, whose face was turned away from her, made a grimace like a man\r\nwho hears a false note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me: is it true that on the very morning of the deed you actually\r\nattended the lectures at the University?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn appreciable fraction of a second elapsed before the real import of\r\nthe question reached him, like a bullet which strikes some time after\r\nthe flash of the fired shot. Luckily his disengaged hand was ready\r\nto grip a bar of the gate. He held it with a terrible force, but his\r\npresence of mind was gone. He could make only a sort of gurgling, grumpy\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Kirylo Sidorovitch!\xe2\x80\x9d she urged him. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are not a\r\nboastful man. _That_ one must say for you. You are a silent man. Too\r\nsilent, perhaps. You are feeding on some bitterness of your own. You are\r\nnot an enthusiast. You are, perhaps, all the stronger for that. But you\r\nmight tell me. One would like to understand you a little more. I was so\r\nimmensely struck.... Have you really done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got his voice back. The shot had missed him. It had been fired at\r\nrandom, altogether, more like a signal for coming to close quarters.\r\nIt was to be a plain struggle for self-preservation. And she was a\r\ndangerous adversary too. But he was ready for battle; he was so ready\r\nthat when he turned towards her not a muscle of his face moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without animation, secretly strung up but\r\nperfectly sure of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cLectures--certainly, But what makes you\r\nask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was she who was animated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had it in a letter, written by a young man in Petersburg; one of\r\nus, of course. You were seen--you were observed with your notebook,\r\nimpassible, taking notes....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe enveloped her with his fixed stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call such coolness superb--that\xe2\x80\x99s all. It is a proof of uncommon\r\nstrength of character. The young man writes that nobody could have\r\nguessed from your face and manner the part you had played only some two\r\nhours before--the great, momentous, glorious part....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. Nobody could have guessed,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Razumov gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, nobody at that time....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. But all the same you are a man of exceptional fortitude, it\r\nseems. You looked exactly as usual. It was remembered afterwards with\r\nwonder....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cost me no effort,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov declared, with the same staring gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s almost more wonderful still!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and fell silent\r\nwhile Razumov asked himself whether he had not said there something\r\nutterly unnecessary--or even worse.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour intention was to stay in Russia? You had planned....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Razumov without haste. \xe2\x80\x9cI had made no plans of any\r\nsort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just simply walked away?\xe2\x80\x9d she struck in.\r\n\r\nHe bowed his head in slow assent. \xe2\x80\x9cSimply--yes.\xe2\x80\x9d He had gradually\r\nreleased his hold on the bar of the gate, as though he had acquired the\r\nconviction that no random shot could knock him over now. And suddenly he\r\nwas inspired to add, \xe2\x80\x9cThe snow was coming down very thick, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a slight appreciative movement of the head, like an expert\r\nin such enterprises, very interested, capable of taking every point\r\nprofessionally. Razumov remembered something he had heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned into a narrow side street, you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on\r\nnegligently, and paused as if it were not worth talking about. Then he\r\nremembered another detail and dropped it before her, like a disdainful\r\ndole to her curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt inclined to lie down and go to sleep there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clicked her tongue at that symptom, very struck indeed. Then--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the notebook! The amazing notebook, man. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you\r\nhad put it in your pocket beforehand!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nRazumov gave a start. It might have been a sign of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went home. Straight home to my rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d he said distinctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coolness of the man! You dared?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I assure you I was perfectly calm. Ha! Calmer than I am now\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you much better as you are now than when you indulge that bitter\r\nvein of yours, Razumov. And nobody in the house saw you return--eh? That\r\nmight have appeared queer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov said firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cDvornik, landlady, girl, all out of the\r\nway. I went up like a shadow. It was a murky morning. The stairs were\r\ndark. I glided up like a phantom. Fate? Luck? What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just see it!\xe2\x80\x9d The eyes of the woman revolutionist snapped darkly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--and then you considered....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had it all ready in his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I looked at my watch, since you want to know. There was just time.\r\nI took that notebook, and ran down the stairs on tiptoe. Have you ever\r\nlistened to the pit-pat of a man running round and round the shaft of\r\na deep staircase? They have a gaslight at the bottom burning night\r\nand day. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s gleaming down there now.... The sound dies\r\nout--the flame winks....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe noticed the vacillation of surprise passing over the steady curiosity\r\nof the black eyes fastened on his face as if the woman revolutionist\r\nreceived the sound of his voice into her pupils instead of her ears. He\r\nchecked himself, passed his hand over his forehead, confused, like a man\r\nwho has been dreaming aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere could a student be running if not to his lectures in the morning?\r\nAt night it\xe2\x80\x99s another matter. I did not care if all the house had been\r\nthere to look at me. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose there was anyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s best not\r\nto be seen or heard. Aha! The people that are neither seen nor heard are\r\nthe lucky ones--in Russia. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you admire my luck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have luck as well as determination,\r\nthen indeed you are likely to turn out an invaluable acquisition for the\r\nwork in hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone was earnest; and it seemed to Razumov that it was speculative,\r\neven as though she were already apportioning him, in her mind, his share\r\nof the work. Her eyes were cast down. He waited, not very alert now, but\r\nwith the grip of the ever-present danger giving him an air of\r\nattentive gravity. Who could have written about him in that letter\r\nfrom Petersburg? A fellow student, surely--some imbecile victim of\r\nrevolutionary propaganda, some foolish slave of foreign, subversive\r\nideals. A long, famine-stricken, red-nosed figure presented itself to\r\nhis mental search. That must have been the fellow!\r\n\r\nHe smiled inwardly at the absolute wrong-headedness of the whole thing,\r\nthe self-deception of a criminal idealist shattering his existence like\r\na thunder-clap out of a clear sky, and re-echoing amongst the wreckage\r\nin the false assumptions of those other fools. Fancy that hungry and\r\npiteous imbecile furnishing to the curiosity of the revolutionist\r\nrefugees this utterly fantastic detail! He appreciated it as by no means\r\nconstituting a danger. On the contrary. As things stood it was for his\r\nadvantage rather, a piece of sinister luck which had only to be accepted\r\nwith proper caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard the musing voice of the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nnot the face of a lucky man.\xe2\x80\x9d She raised her eyes with renewed interest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so that was the way of it. After doing your work you simply walked\r\noff and made for your rooms. That sort of thing succeeds sometimes. I\r\nsuppose it was agreed beforehand that, once the business over, each of\r\nyou would go his own way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov preserved the seriousness of his expression and the deliberate,\r\nif cautious, manner of speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas not that the best thing to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a dispassionate tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after waiting a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cwe did not give much\r\nthought to what would come after. We never discussed formally any line\r\nof conduct. It was understood, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe approved his statement with slight nods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, of course, wished to remain in Russia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn St. Petersburg itself,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasized Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the only safe\r\ncourse for me. And, moreover, I had nowhere else to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Yes! I know. Clearly. And the other--this wonderful Haldin\r\nappearing only to be regretted--you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he intended?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had foreseen that such a question would certainly come to meet\r\nhim sooner or later. He raised his hands a little and let them fall\r\nhelplessly by his side--nothing more.\r\n\r\nIt was the white-haired woman conspirator who was the first to break the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery curious,\xe2\x80\x9d she pronounced slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you did not think, Kirylo\r\nSidorovitch, that he might perhaps wish to get in touch with you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov discovered that he could not suppress the trembling of his lips.\r\nBut he thought that he owed it to himself to speak. A negative sign\r\nwould not do again. Speak he must, if only to get at the bottom of what\r\nthat St. Petersburg letter might have contained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stayed at home next day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bending down a little and plunging\r\nhis glance into the black eyes of the woman so that she should not\r\nobserve the trembling of his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I stayed at home. As my actions\r\nare remembered and written about, then perhaps you are aware that I\r\nwas _not_ seen at the lectures next day. Eh? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know? Well, I\r\nstopped at home-the live-long day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if moved by his agitated tone, she murmured a sympathetic \xe2\x80\x9cI see! It\r\nmust have been trying enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to understand one\xe2\x80\x99s feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov steadily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\ntrying. It was horrible; it was an atrocious day. It was not the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understand. Afterwards, when you heard they had got him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI know how one feels after losing a comrade in the good fight? One\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nashamed of being left. And I can remember so many. Never mind. They\r\nshall be avenged before long. And what is death? At any rate, it is not\r\na shameful thing like some kinds of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov felt something stir in his breast, a sort of feeble and\r\nunpleasant tremor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome kinds of life?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, looking at her searchingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe subservient, submissive life. Life? No! Vegetation on the filthy\r\nheap of iniquity which the world is. Life, Razumov, not to be vile must\r\nbe a revolt--a pitiless protest--all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe calmed down, the gleam of suffused tears in her eyes dried out\r\ninstantly by the heat of her passion, and it was in her capable,\r\nbusinesslike manner that she went on--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand me, Razumov. You are not an enthusiast, but there is an\r\nimmense force of revolt in you. I felt it from the first, directly I\r\nset my eyes on you--you remember--in Zurich. Oh! You are full of bitter\r\nrevolt. That is good. Indignation flags sometimes, revenge itself may\r\nbecome a weariness, but that uncompromising sense of necessity and\r\njustice which armed your and Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s hands to strike down that\r\nfanatical brute...for it was that--nothing but that! I have been\r\nthinking it out. It could have been nothing else but that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov made a slight bow, the irony of which was concealed by an almost\r\nsinister immobility of feature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for the dead. As for myself, I can assure you that my\r\nconduct was dictated by necessity and by the sense of--well--retributive\r\njustice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, while her eyes rested upon him, black\r\nand impenetrable like the mental caverns where revolutionary thought\r\nshould sit plotting the violent way of its dream of changes. As\r\nif anything could be changed! In this world of men nothing can be\r\nchanged--neither happiness nor misery. They can only be displaced at\r\nthe cost of corrupted consciences and broken lives--a futile game for\r\narrogant philosophers and sanguinary triflers. Those thoughts darted\r\nthrough Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s head while he stood facing the old revolutionary hand,\r\nthe respected, trusted, and influential Sophia Antonovna, whose word had\r\nsuch a weight in the \xe2\x80\x9cactive\xe2\x80\x9d section of every party. She was much more\r\nrepresentative than the great Peter Ivanovitch. Stripped of rhetoric,\r\nmysticism, and theories, she was the true spirit of destructive\r\nrevolution. And she was the personal adversary he had to meet. It gave\r\nhim a feeling of triumphant pleasure to deceive her out of her own\r\nmouth. The epigrammatic saying that speech has been given to us for the\r\npurpose of concealing our thoughts came into his mind. Of that cynical\r\ntheory this was a very subtle and a very scornful application, flouting\r\nin its own words the very spirit of ruthless revolution, embodied in\r\nthat woman with her white hair and black eyebrows, like slightly sinuous\r\nlines of Indian ink, drawn together by the perpendicular folds of a\r\nthoughtful frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Retributive. No pity!\xe2\x80\x9d was the conclusion of her silence.\r\nAnd this once broken, she went on impulsively in short, vibrating\r\nsentences--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to my story, Razumov!...\xe2\x80\x9d Her father was a clever but unlucky\r\nartisan. No joy had lighted up his laborious days. He died at fifty;\r\nall the years of his life he had panted under the thumb of masters whose\r\nrapacity exacted from him the price of the water, of the salt, of the\r\nvery air he breathed; taxed the sweat of his brow and claimed the blood\r\nof his sons. No protection, no guidance! What had society to say to him?\r\nBe submissive and be honest. If you rebel I shall kill you. If you steal\r\nI shall imprison you. But if you suffer I have nothing for you--nothing\r\nexcept perhaps a beggarly dole of bread--but no consolation for your\r\ntrouble, no respect for your manhood, no pity for the sorrows of your\r\nmiserable life.\r\n\r\nAnd so he laboured, he suffered, and he died. He died in the hospital.\r\nStanding by the common grave she thought of his tormented existence--she\r\nsaw it whole. She reckoned the simple joys of life, the birthright of\r\nthe humblest, of which his gentle heart had been robbed by the crime of\r\na society which nothing can absolve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, in an impressive, lowered voice, \xe2\x80\x9cit was\r\nlike a lurid light in which I stood, still almost a child, and cursed\r\nnot the toil, not the misery which had been his lot, but the great\r\nsocial iniquity of the system resting on unrequited toil and unpitied\r\nsufferings. From that moment I was a revolutionist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, trying to raise himself above the dangerous weaknesses of\r\ncontempt or compassion, had preserved an impassive countenance. She,\r\nwith an unaffected touch of mere bitterness, the first he could notice\r\nsince he had come in contact with the woman, went on--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I could not go to the Church where the priests of the system\r\nexhorted such unconsidered vermin as I to resignation, I went to the\r\nsecret societies as soon as I knew how to find my way. I was sixteen\r\nyears old--no more, Razumov! And--look at my white hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn these last words there was neither pride nor sadness. The bitterness\r\ntoo was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lot of it. I had always magnificent hair, even as a chit of\r\na girl. Only, at that time we were cutting it short and thinking that\r\nthere was the first step towards crushing the social infamy. Crush the\r\nInfamy! A fine watchword! I would placard it on the walls of prisons and\r\npalaces, carve it on hard rocks, hang it out in letters of fire on that\r\nempty sky for a sign of hope and terror--a portent of the end....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are eloquent, Sophia Antonovna,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov interrupted suddenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly, so far you seem to have been writing it in water....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was checked but not offended. \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows? Very soon it may become\r\na fact written all over that great land of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d she hinted meaningly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then one would have lived long enough. White hair won\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov looked at her white hair: and this mark of so many uneasy years\r\nseemed nothing but a testimony to the invincible vigour of revolt. It\r\nthrew out into an astonishing relief the unwrinkled face, the\r\nbrilliant black glance, the upright compact figure, the simple,\r\nbrisk self-possession of the mature personality--as though in her\r\nrevolutionary pilgrimage she had discovered the secret, not of\r\neverlasting youth, but of everlasting endurance.\r\n\r\nHow un-Russian she looked, thought Razumov. Her mother might have been\r\na Jewess or an Armenian or devil knew what. He reflected that a\r\nrevolutionist is seldom true to the settled type. All revolt is the\r\nexpression of strong individualism--ran his thought vaguely. One\r\ncan tell them a mile off in any society, in any surroundings. It was\r\nastonishing that the police....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not meet again very soon, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nleaving to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Zurich?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov asked casually, but feeling relieved, not from\r\nany distinct apprehension, but from a feeling of stress as if after a\r\nwrestling match.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Zurich--and farther on, perhaps, much farther. Another journey.\r\nWhen I think of all my journeys! The last must come some day. Never\r\nmind, Razumov. We had to have a good long talk. I would have certainly\r\ntried to see you if we had not met. Peter Ivanovitch knows where you\r\nlive? Yes. I meant to have asked him--but it\xe2\x80\x99s better like this. You\r\nsee, we expect two more men; and I had much rather wait here talking\r\nwith you than up there at the house with....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving cast a glance beyond the gate, she interrupted herself. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\r\nthey are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said rapidly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Kirylo Sidorovitch, we shall have to\r\nsay good-bye, presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his incertitude of the ground on which he stood Razumov felt\r\nperturbed. Turning his head quickly, he saw two men on the opposite side\r\nof the road. Seeing themselves noticed by Sophia Antonovna, they crossed\r\nover at once, and passed one after another through the little gate\r\nby the side of the empty lodge. They looked hard at the stranger, but\r\nwithout mistrust, the crimson blouse being a flaring safety signal. The\r\nfirst, great white hairless face, double chin, prominent stomach, which\r\nhe seemed to carry forward consciously within a strongly distended\r\novercoat, only nodded and averted his eyes peevishly; his\r\ncompanion--lean, flushed cheekbones, a military red moustache below a\r\nsharp, salient nose--approached at once Sophia Antonovna, greeting her\r\nwarmly. His voice was very strong but inarticulate. It sounded like a\r\ndeep buzzing. The woman revolutionist was quietly cordial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced in a clear voice.\r\n\r\nThe lean new-comer made an eager half-turn. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will want to embrace\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d thought our young man with a deep recoil of all his being, while\r\nhis limbs seemed too heavy to move. But it was a groundless alarm. He\r\nhad to do now with a generation of conspirators who did not kiss each\r\nother on both cheeks; and raising an arm that felt like lead he dropped\r\nhis hand into a largely-outstretched palm, fleshless and hot as if\r\ndried up by fever, giving a bony pressure, expressive, seeming to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween us there\xe2\x80\x99s no need of words.\xe2\x80\x9d The man had big, wide-open eyes.\r\nRazumov fancied he could see a smile behind their sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia Antonovna repeated loudly for the benefit of\r\nthe fat man, who at some distance displayed the profile of his stomach.\r\n\r\nNo one moved. Everything, sounds, attitudes, movements, and immobility\r\nseemed to be part of an experiment, the result of which was a thin voice\r\npiping with comic peevishness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! Razumov. We have been hearing of nothing but Mr. Razumov for\r\nmonths. For my part, I confess I would rather have seen Haldin on this\r\nspot instead of Mr. Razumov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe squeaky stress put on the name \xe2\x80\x9cRazumov--Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x9d pierced the\r\near ridiculously, like the falsetto of a circus clown beginning an\r\nelaborate joke. Astonishment was Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s first response, followed by\r\nsudden indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in a stern tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut! Silliness. He\xe2\x80\x99s always like that.\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia Antonovna was obviously\r\nvexed. But she dropped the information, \xe2\x80\x9cNecator,\xe2\x80\x9d from her lips just\r\nloud enough to be heard by Razumov. The abrupt squeaks of the fat man\r\nseemed to proceed from that thing like a balloon he carried under his\r\novercoat. The stolidity of his attitude, the big feet, the lifeless,\r\nhanging hands, the enormous bloodless cheek, the thin wisps of hair\r\nstraggling down the fat nape of the neck, fascinated Razumov into a\r\nstare on the verge of horror and laughter.\r\n\r\nNikita, surnamed Necator, with a sinister aptness of alliteration!\r\nRazumov had heard of him. He had heard so much since crossing the\r\nfrontier of these celebrities of the militant revolution; the legends,\r\nthe stories, the authentic chronicle, which now and then peeps out\r\nbefore a half-incredulous world. Razumov had heard of him. He was\r\nsupposed to have killed more, gendarmes and police agents than any\r\nrevolutionist living. He had been entrusted with executions.\r\n\r\nThe paper with the letters N.N., the very pseudonym of murder,\r\nfound pinned on the stabbed breast of a certain notorious spy (this\r\npicturesque detail of a sensational murder case had got into\r\nthe newspapers), was the mark of his handiwork. \xe2\x80\x9cBy order of the\r\nCommittee.--N.N.\xe2\x80\x9d A corner of the curtain lifted to strike the\r\nimagination of the gaping world. He was said to have been innumerable\r\ntimes in and out of Russia, the Necator of bureaucrats, of provincial\r\ngovernors, of obscure informers. He lived between whiles, Razumov had\r\nheard, on the shores of the Lake of Como, with a charming wife, devoted\r\nto the cause, and two young children. But how could that creature, so\r\ngrotesque as to set town dogs barking at its mere sight, go about on\r\nthose deadly errands and slip through the meshes of the police?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now? what now?\xe2\x80\x9d the voice squeaked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only sincere. It\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\ndenied that the other was the leading spirit. Well, it would have been\r\nbetter if he had been the one spared to us. More useful. I am not a\r\nsentimentalist. Say what I think...only natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSqueak, squeak, squeak, without a gesture, without a stir--the horrible\r\nsqueaky burlesque of professional jealousy--this man of a sinister\r\nalliterative nickname, this executioner of revolutionary verdicts, the\r\nterrifying N.N. exasperated like a fashionable tenor by the attention\r\nattracted to the performance of an obscure amateur. Sophia Antonovna\r\nshrugged her shoulders. The comrade with the martial red moustache\r\nhurried towards Razumov full of conciliatory intentions in his strong\r\nbuzzing voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take it! And in this place, too, in the public street, so to\r\nspeak. But you can see yourself how it is. One of his fantastic sallies.\r\nAbsolutely of no consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t concern yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumov, going off into a long fit\r\nof laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, his hectic flush like a pair of burns on his cheek-bones,\r\nstared for a moment and burst out laughing too. Razumov, whose hilarity\r\ndied out all at once, made a step forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of this,\xe2\x80\x9d he began in a clear, incisive voice, though he could\r\nhardly control the trembling of his legs. \xe2\x80\x9cI will have no more of it. I\r\nshall not permit anyone.... I can see very well what you are at with\r\nthose allusions.... Inquire, investigate! I defy you, but I will not\r\nbe played with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken such words before. He had been driven to cry them out in\r\nthe face of other suspicions. It was an infernal cycle bringing round\r\nthat protest like a fatal necessity of his existence. But it was no use.\r\nHe would be always played with. Luckily life does not last for ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, striking his fist into the palm of his\r\nother hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirylo Sidorovitch--what has come to you?\xe2\x80\x9d The woman revolutionist\r\ninterfered with authority. They were all looking at Razumov now; the\r\nslayer of spies and gendarmes had turned about, presenting his enormous\r\nstomach in full, like a shield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t shout. There are people passing.\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia Antonovna was\r\napprehensive of another outburst. A steam-launch from Monrepos had\r\ncome to the landing-stage opposite the gate, its hoarse whistle and\r\nthe churning noise alongside all unnoticed, had landed a small bunch of\r\nlocal passengers who were dispersing their several ways. Only a specimen\r\nof early tourist in knickerbockers, conspicuous by a brand-new yellow\r\nleather glass-case, hung about for a moment, scenting something unusual\r\nabout these four people within the rusty iron gates of what looked the\r\ngrounds run wild of an unoccupied private house. Ah! If he had only\r\nknown what the chance of commonplace travelling had suddenly put in his\r\nway! But he was a well-bred person; he averted his gaze and moved off\r\nwith short steps along the avenue, on the watch for a tramcar.\r\n\r\nA gesture from Sophia Antonovna, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave him to me,\xe2\x80\x9d had sent the two men\r\naway--the buzzing of the inarticulate voice growing fainter and fainter,\r\nand the thin pipe of \xe2\x80\x9cWhat now? what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d reduced to the\r\nproportions of a squeaking toy by the distance. They had left him to\r\nher. So many things could be left safely to the experience of Sophia\r\nAntonovna. And at once, her black eyes turned to Razumov, her mind tried\r\nto get at the heart of that outburst. It had some meaning. No one is\r\nborn an active revolutionist. The change comes disturbingly, with the\r\nforce of a sudden vocation, bringing in its train agonizing doubts,\r\nassertive violences, an unstable state of the soul, till the final\r\nappeasement of the convert in the perfect fierceness of conviction. She\r\nhad seen--often had only divined--scores of these young men and young\r\nwomen going through an emotional crisis. This young man looked like a\r\nmoody egotist. And besides, it was a special--a unique case. She had\r\nnever met an individuality which interested and puzzled her so much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Razumov, my good friend. If you carry on like this you will\r\ngo mad. You are angry with everybody and bitter with yourself, and on\r\nthe look out for something to torment yourself with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov could only speak in gasps. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must admit\r\nthat I can have no illusions on the attitude which...it isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear...or\r\nrather only too clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture of despair. It was not his courage that failed him.\r\nThe choking fumes of falsehood had taken him by the throat--the thought\r\nof being condemned to struggle on and on in that tainted atmosphere\r\nwithout the hope of ever renewing his strength by a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA glass of cold water is what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia Antonovna glanced up\r\nthe grounds at the house and shook her head, then out of the gate at\r\nthe brimful placidity of the lake. With a half-comical shrug of the\r\nshoulders, she gave the remedy up in the face of that abundance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is you, my dear soul, who are flinging yourself at something which\r\ndoes not exist. What is it? Self-reproach, or what? It\xe2\x80\x99s absurd. You\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone and given yourself up because your comrade was\r\ntaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remonstrated with him reasonably, at some length too. He had nothing\r\nto complain of in his reception. Every new-comer was discussed more or\r\nless. Everybody had to be thoroughly understood before being accepted.\r\nNo one that she could remember had been shown from the first so much\r\nconfidence. Soon, very soon, perhaps sooner than he expected, he would\r\nbe given an opportunity of showing his devotion to the sacred task of\r\ncrushing the Infamy.\r\n\r\nRazumov, listening quietly, thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that she is trying to\r\nlull my suspicions to sleep. On the other hand, it is obvious that most\r\nof them are fools.\xe2\x80\x9d He moved aside a couple of paces and, folding his\r\narms on his breast, leaned back against the stone pillar of the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to what remains obscure in the fate of that poor Haldin,\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia\r\nAntonovna dropped into a slowness of utterance which was to Razumov like\r\nthe falling of molten lead drop by drop; \xe2\x80\x9cas to that--though no one ever\r\nhinted that either from fear or neglect your conduct has not been what\r\nit should have been--well, I have a bit of intelligence....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov could not prevent himself from raising his head, and Sophia\r\nAntonovna nodded slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have. You remember that letter from St. Petersburg I mentioned to you\r\na moment ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter? Perfectly. Some busybody has been reporting my conduct on\r\na certain day. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather sickening. I suppose our police are greatly\r\nedified when they open these interesting and--and--superfluous letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no! The police do not get hold of our letters as easily as you\r\nimagine. The letter in question did not leave St. Petersburg till the\r\nice broke up. It went by the first English steamer which left the Neva\r\nthis spring. They have a fireman on board--one of us, in fact. It has\r\nreached me from Hull....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused as if she were surprised at the sullen fixity of Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngaze, but went on at once, and much faster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have some of our people there who...but never mind. The writer\r\nof the letter relates an incident which he thinks may possibly be\r\nconnected with Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s arrest. I was just going to tell you when those\r\ntwo men came along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat also was an incident,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumov, \xe2\x80\x9cof a very charming\r\nkind--for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave off that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sophia Antonovna. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody cares for Nikita\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbarking. There\xe2\x80\x99s no malice in him. Listen to what I have to say. You\r\nmay be able to throw a light. There was in St. Petersburg a sort of town\r\npeasant--a man who owned horses. He came to town years ago to work for\r\nsome relation as a driver and ended by owning a cab or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe might well have spared herself the slight effort of the gesture:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov did not mean to speak; he could not have interrupted\r\nher now, not to save his life. The contraction of his facial muscles had\r\nbeen involuntary, a mere surface stir, leaving him sullenly attentive as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not a quite ordinary man of his class--it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people of the house--my informant talked with many of them--you\r\nknow, one of those enormous houses of shame and misery....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna need not have enlarged on the character of the house.\r\nRazumov saw clearly, towering at her back, a dark mass of masonry veiled\r\nin snowflakes, with the long row of windows of the eating-shop shining\r\ngreasily very near the ground. The ghost of that night pursued him. He\r\nstood up to it with rage and with weariness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the late Haldin ever by chance speak to you of that house?\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia\r\nAntonovna was anxious to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov, making that answer, wondered whether he were falling\r\ninto a trap. It was so humiliating to lie to these people that he\r\nprobably could not have said no. \xe2\x80\x9cHe mentioned to me once,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as\r\nif making an effort of memory, \xe2\x80\x9ca house of that sort. He used to visit\r\nsome workmen there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna triumphed. Her correspondent had discovered that fact\r\nquite accidentally from the talk of the people of the house, having\r\nmade friends with a workman who occupied a room there. They described\r\nHaldin\xe2\x80\x99s appearance perfectly. He brought comforting words of hope into\r\ntheir misery. He came irregularly, but he came very often, and--her\r\ncorrespondent wrote--sometimes he spent a night in the house, sleeping,\r\nthey thought, in a stable which opened upon the inner yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNote that, Razumov! In a stable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov had listened with a sort of ferocious but amused acquiescence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. In the straw. It was probably the cleanest spot in the whole\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d assented the woman with that deep frown which seemed to draw\r\ncloser together her black eyes in a sinister fashion. No four-footed\r\nbeast could stand the filth and wretchedness so many human beings were\r\ncondemned to suffer from in Russia. The point of this discovery was that\r\nit proved Haldin to have been familiar with that horse-owning peasant--a\r\nreckless, independent, free-living fellow not much liked by the other\r\ninhabitants of the house. He was believed to have been the associate of\r\na band of housebreakers. Some of these got captured. Not while he was\r\ndriving them, however; but still there was a suspicion against the\r\nfellow of having given a hint to the police and...\r\n\r\nThe woman revolutionist checked herself suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you? Have you ever heard your friend refer to a certain\r\nZiemianitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov was ready for the name. He had been looking out for the\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes I shall own up,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to himself. But he\r\ntook his time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d he began slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cZiemianitch, a peasant owning a team of\r\nhorses. Yes. On one occasion. Ziemianitch! Certainly! Ziemianitch of the\r\nhorses.... How could it have slipped my memory like this? One of the\r\nlast conversations we had together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means,\xe2\x80\x9d--Sophia Antonovna looked very grave,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat means,\r\nRazumov, it was very shortly before--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore what?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Razumov, advancing at the woman, who looked\r\nastonished but stood her ground. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore.... Oh! Of course, it was\r\nbefore! How could it have been after? Only a few hours before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he spoke of him favourably?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith enthusiasm! The horses of Ziemianitch! The free soul of\r\nZiemianitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov took a savage delight in the loud utterance of that name, which\r\nhad never before crossed his lips audibly. He fixed his blazing eyes\r\non the woman till at last her fascinated expression recalled him to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe late Haldin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding himself in, with downcast eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas inclined to take sudden fancies to people, on--on--what shall I\r\nsay--insufficient grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia Antonovna clapped her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThat, to my mind, settles\r\nit. The suspicions of my correspondent were aroused....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! Your correspondent,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov said in an almost openly mocking\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat suspicions? How aroused? By this Ziemianitch? Probably some\r\ndrunken, gabbling, plausible...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk as if you had known him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But I knew Haldin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. Every word you say confirms to my mind the suspicion\r\ncommunicated to me in that very interesting letter. This Ziemianitch was\r\nfound one morning hanging from a hook in the stable--dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov felt a profound trouble. It was visible, because Sophia\r\nAntonovna was moved to observe vivaciously--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! You begin to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw it clearly enough--in the light of a lantern casting spokes of\r\nshadow in a cellar-like stable, the body in a sheepskin coat and long\r\nboots hanging against the wall. A pointed hood, with the ends wound\r\nabout up to the eyes, hid the face. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that does not concern me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreflected. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does not affect my position at all. He never knew who had\r\nthrashed him. He could not have known.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov felt sorry for the old\r\nlover of the bottle and women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Some of them end like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your idea,\r\nSophia Antonovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was really the idea of her correspondent, but Sophia Antonovna had\r\nadopted it fully. She stated it in one word--\xe2\x80\x9cRemorse.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov opened\r\nhis eyes very wide at that. Sophia Antonovna\xe2\x80\x99s informant, by listening\r\nto the talk of the house, by putting this and that together, had managed\r\nto come very near to the truth of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s relation to Ziemianitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I who can tell you what you were not certain of--that your friend\r\nhad some plan for saving himself afterwards, for getting out of St.\r\nPetersburg, at any rate. Perhaps that and no more, trusting to luck for\r\nthe rest. And that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s horses were part of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have actually got at the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov marvelled to himself,\r\nwhile he nodded judicially. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s possible, very possible.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nthe woman revolutionist was very positive that it was so. First of all,\r\na conversation about horses between Haldin and Ziemianitch had been\r\npartly overheard. Then there were the suspicions of the people in the\r\nhouse when their \xe2\x80\x9cyoung gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (they did not know Haldin by\r\nhis name) ceased to call at the house. Some of them used to charge\r\nZiemianitch with knowing something of this absence. He denied it with\r\nexasperation; but the fact was that ever since Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance he\r\nwas not himself, growing moody and thin. Finally, during a quarrel with\r\nsome woman (to whom he was making up), in which most of the inmates of\r\nthe house took part apparently, he was openly abused by his chief enemy,\r\nan athletic pedlar, for an informer, and for having driven \xe2\x80\x9cour young\r\ngentleman to Siberia, the same as you did those young fellows who broke\r\ninto houses.\xe2\x80\x9d In consequence of this there was a fight, and Ziemianitch\r\ngot flung down a flight of stairs. Thereupon he drank and moped for a\r\nweek, and then hanged himself.\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna drew her conclusions from the tale. She charged\r\nZiemianitch either with drunken indiscretion as to a driving job on a\r\ncertain date, overheard by some spy in some low grog-shop--perhaps in\r\nthe very eating-shop on the ground floor of the house--or, maybe, a\r\ndownright denunciation, followed by remorse. A man like that would be\r\ncapable of anything. People said he was a flighty old chap. And if he\r\nhad been once before mixed up with the police--as seemed certain, though\r\nhe always denied it--in connexion with these thieves, he would be sure\r\nto be acquainted with some police underlings, always on the look out for\r\nsomething to report. Possibly at first his tale was not made anything of\r\ntill the day that scoundrel de P--- got his deserts. Ah! But then every\r\nbit and scrap of hint and information would be acted on, and fatally\r\nthey were bound to get Haldin.\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna spread out her hands--\xe2\x80\x9cFatally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFatality--chance! Razumov meditated in silent astonishment upon the\r\nqueer verisimilitude of these inferences. They were obviously to his\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is right now to make this conclusive evidence known generally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Sophia Antonovna was very calm and deliberate again. She had received\r\nthe letter three days ago, but did not write at once to Peter\r\nIvanovitch. She knew then that she would have the opportunity presently\r\nof meeting several men of action assembled for an important purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would be more effective if I could show the letter itself\r\nat large. I have it in my pocket now. You understand how pleased I was\r\nto come upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov was saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t offer to show the letter to\r\nme. Not likely. Has she told me everything that correspondent of hers\r\nhas found out?\xe2\x80\x9d He longed to see the letter, but he felt he must not\r\nask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, please, was this an investigation ordered, as it were?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are again with your sensitiveness.\r\nIt makes you stupid. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, there was no starting-point for an\r\ninvestigation even if any one had thought of it. A perfect blank! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexactly what some people were pointing out as the reason for receiving\r\nyou cautiously. It was all perfectly accidental, arising from my\r\ninformant striking an acquaintance with an intelligent skindresser\r\nlodging in that particular slum-house. A wonderful coincidence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pious person,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Razumov, with a pale smile, \xe2\x80\x9cwould say that\r\nthe hand of God has done it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor father would have said that.\xe2\x80\x9d Sophia Antonovna did not smile.\r\nShe dropped her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that his God ever helped him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long\r\ntime since God has done anything for the people. Anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this would be quite final,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov, with every appearance of\r\nreflective impartiality, \xe2\x80\x9cif there was any certitude that the \xe2\x80\x98our young\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99 of these people was Victor Haldin. Have we got that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. There\xe2\x80\x99s no mistake. My correspondent was as familiar with Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersonal appearance as with your own,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman affirmed decisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the red-nosed fellow beyond a doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov said to himself,\r\nwith reawakened uneasiness. Had his own visit to that accursed house\r\npassed unnoticed? It was barely possible. Yet it was hardly probable.\r\nIt was just the right sort of food for the popular gossip that gaunt\r\nbusybody had been picking up. But the letter did not seem to contain any\r\nallusion to that. Unless she had suppressed it. And, if so, why? If it\r\nhad really escaped the prying of that hunger-stricken democrat with a\r\nconfounded genius for recognizing people from description, it could\r\nonly be for a time. He would come upon it presently and hasten to write\r\nanother letter--and then!\r\n\r\nFor all the envenomed recklessness of his temper, fed on hate and\r\ndisdain, Razumov shuddered inwardly. It guarded him from common fear,\r\nbut it could not defend him from disgust at being dealt with in any way\r\nby these people. It was a sort of superstitious dread. Now, since his\r\nposition had been made more secure by their own folly at the cost of\r\nZiemianitch, he felt the need of perfect safety, with its freedom\r\nfrom direct lying, with its power of moving amongst them silent,\r\nunquestioning, listening, impenetrable, like the very fate of their\r\ncrimes and their folly. Was this advantage his already? Or not yet? Or\r\nnever would be?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sophia Antonovna,\xe2\x80\x9d his air of reluctant concession was genuine\r\nin so far that he was really loath to part with her without testing her\r\nsincerity by a question it was impossible to bring about in any way;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwell, Sophia Antonovna, if that is so, then--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe creature has done justice to himself,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman observed, as if\r\nthinking aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Ah yes! Remorse,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov muttered, with equivocal contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be harsh, Kirylo Sidorovitch, if you have lost a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwas no hint of softness in her tone, only the black glitter of her eyes\r\nseemed detached for an instant from vengeful visions. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a man of\r\nthe people. The simple Russian soul is never wholly impenitent. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething to know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsoling?\xe2\x80\x9d insinuated Razumov, in a tone of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave off railing,\xe2\x80\x9d she checked him explosively. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, Razumov,\r\nthat women, children, and revolutionists hate irony, which is the\r\nnegation of all saving instincts, of all faith, of all devotion, of all\r\naction. Don\xe2\x80\x99t rail! Leave off.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is, but there\r\nare moments when you are abhorrent to me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe averted her face. A languid silence, as if all the electricity of\r\nthe situation had been discharged in this flash of passion, lasted for\r\nsome time. Razumov had not flinched. Suddenly she laid the tips of her\r\nfingers on his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said very quietly.\r\n\r\nHe was proud to feel that she could read nothing on his face. He was\r\nreally mollified, relieved, if only for a moment, from an obscure\r\noppression. And suddenly he asked himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil did I go to\r\nthat house? It was an imbecile thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA profound disgust came over him. Sophia Antonovna lingered, talking\r\nin a friendly manner with an evident conciliatory intention. And it was\r\nstill about the famous letter, referring to various minute details\r\ngiven by her informant, who had never seen Ziemianitch. The \xe2\x80\x9cvictim of\r\nremorse\xe2\x80\x9d had been buried several weeks before her correspondent began\r\nfrequenting the house. It--the house--contained very good revolutionary\r\nmaterial. The spirit of the heroic Haldin had passed through these dens\r\nof black wretchedness with a promise of universal redemption from all\r\nthe miseries that oppress mankind. Razumov listened without hearing,\r\ngnawed by the newborn desire of safety with its independence from that\r\ndegrading method of direct lying which at times he found it almost\r\nimpossible to practice.\r\n\r\nNo. The point he wanted to hear about could never come into this\r\nconversation. There was no way of bringing it forward. He regretted\r\nnot having composed a perfect story for use abroad, in which his fatal\r\nconnexion with the house might have been owned up to. But when he left\r\nRussia he did not know that Ziemianitch had hanged himself. And, anyway,\r\nwho could have foreseen this woman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinformant\xe2\x80\x9d stumbling upon that\r\nparticular slum, of all the slums awaiting destruction in the purifying\r\nflame of social revolution? Who could have foreseen? Nobody! \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nperfect, diabolic surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov, calm-faced in his attitude\r\nof inscrutable superiority, nodding assent to Sophia Antonovna\xe2\x80\x99s remarks\r\nupon the psychology of \xe2\x80\x9cthe people,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d rather\r\ncoldly, but with a nervous longing in his fingers to tear some sort of\r\nconfession out of her throat.\r\n\r\nThen, at the very last, on the point of separating, the feeling of\r\nrelaxed tension already upon him, he heard Sophia Antonovna allude to\r\nthe subject of his uneasiness. How it came about he could only guess,\r\nhis mind being absent at the moment, but it must have sprung from Sophia\r\nAntonovna\xe2\x80\x99s complaints of the illogical absurdity of the people. For\r\ninstance--that Ziemianitch was notoriously irreligious, and yet, in the\r\nlast weeks of his life, he suffered from the notion that he had been\r\nbeaten by the devil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Razumov, as though he had not heard aright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe actual devil. The devil in person. You may well look astonished,\r\nKirylo Sidorovitch. Early on the very night poor Haldin was taken,\r\na complete stranger turned up and gave Ziemianitch a most fearful\r\nthrashing while he was lying dead-drunk in the stable. The wretched\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s body was one mass of bruises. He showed them to the people in\r\nthe house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, Sophia Antonovna, you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the actual devil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the woman curtly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot but that there are plenty of\r\nmen worse than devils to make a hell of this earth,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nRazumov watched her, vigorous and white-haired, with the deep fold\r\nbetween her thin eyebrows, and her black glance turned idly away. It was\r\nobvious that she did not make much of the story--unless, indeed, this\r\nwas the perfection of duplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cA dark young man,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained\r\nfurther. \xe2\x80\x9cNever seen there before, never seen afterwards. Why are you\r\nsmiling, Razumov?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the devil being still young after all these ages,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\r\ncomposedly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who was able to describe him, since the victim, you\r\nsay, was dead-drunk at the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! The eating-house keeper has described him. An overbearing,\r\nswarthy young man in a student\xe2\x80\x99s cloak, who came rushing in, demanded\r\nZiemianitch, beat him furiously, and rushed away without a word, leaving\r\nthe eating-house keeper paralysed with astonishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he, too, believe it was the devil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. I am told he\xe2\x80\x99s very reserved on the matter. Those\r\nsellers of spirits are great scoundrels generally. I should think he\r\nknows more of it than anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and you, Sophia Antonovna, what\xe2\x80\x99s your theory?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Razumov\r\nin a tone of great interest. \xe2\x80\x9cYours and your informant\xe2\x80\x99s, who is on the\r\nspot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with him. Some police-hound in disguise. Who else could beat a\r\nhelpless man so unmercifully? As for the rest, if they were out that day\r\non every trail, old and new, it is probable enough that they might\r\nhave thought it just as well to have Ziemianitch at hand for more\r\ninformation, or for identification, or what not. Some scoundrelly\r\ndetective was sent to fetch him along, and being vexed at finding him\r\nso drunk broke a stable fork over his ribs. Later on, after they had the\r\nbig game safe in the net, they troubled their heads no more about that\r\npeasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the last words of the woman revolutionist in this\r\nconversation, keeping so close to the truth, departing from it so far in\r\nthe verisimilitude of thoughts and conclusions as to give one the notion\r\nof the invincible nature of human error, a glimpse into the utmost\r\ndepths of self-deception. Razumov, after shaking hands with Sophia\r\nAntonovna, left the grounds, crossed the road, and walking out on the\r\nlittle steamboat pier leaned over the rail.\r\n\r\nHis mind was at ease; ease such as he had not known for many days,\r\never since that night...the night. The conversation with the woman\r\nrevolutionist had given him the view of his danger at the very moment\r\nthis danger vanished, characteristically enough. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have\r\nforeseen the doubts that would arise in those people\xe2\x80\x99s minds,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought. Then his attention being attracted by a stone of peculiar\r\nshape, which he could see clearly lying at the bottom, he began to\r\nspeculate as to the depth of water in that spot. But very soon, with a\r\nstart of wonder at this extraordinary instance of ill-timed detachment,\r\nhe returned to his train of thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have told very\r\ncircumstantial lies from the first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, with a mortal\r\ndistaste of the mere idea which silenced his mental utterance for quite\r\na perceptible interval. \xe2\x80\x9cLuckily, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected,\r\nand after a time spoke to himself, half aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and laughed a little.\r\n\r\nThe end of Ziemianitch then arrested his wandering thoughts. He was not\r\nexactly amused at the interpretation, but he could not help detecting\r\nin it a certain piquancy. He owned to himself that, had he known of that\r\nsuicide before leaving Russia, he would have been incapable of making\r\nsuch excellent use of it for his own purposes. He ought to be infinitely\r\nobliged to the fellow with the red nose for his patience and ingenuity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wonderful psychologist apparently,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself sarcastically.\r\nRemorse, indeed! It was a striking example of your true conspirator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblindness, of the stupid subtlety of people with one idea. This was\r\na drama of love, not of conscience, Razumov continued to himself\r\nmockingly. A woman the old fellow was making up to! A robust pedlar,\r\nclearly a rival, throwing him down a flight of stairs.... And at\r\nsixty, for a lifelong lover, it was not an easy matter to get over.\r\nThat was a feminist of a different stamp from Peter Ivanovitch. Even the\r\ncomfort of the bottle might conceivably fail him in this supreme\r\ncrisis. At such an age nothing but a halter could cure the pangs of\r\nan unquenchable passion. And, besides, there was the wild exasperation\r\naroused by the unjust aspersions and the contumely of the house, with\r\nthe maddening impossibility to account for that mysterious thrashing,\r\nadded to these simple and bitter sorrows. \xe2\x80\x9cDevil, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov\r\nexclaimed, with mental excitement, as if he had made an interesting\r\ndiscovery. \xe2\x80\x9cZiemianitch ended by falling into mysticism. So many of our\r\ntrue Russian souls end in that way! Very characteristic.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt pity\r\nfor Ziemianitch, a large neutral pity, such as one may feel for an\r\nunconscious multitude, a great people seen from above--like a community\r\nof crawling ants working out its destiny. It was as if this Ziemianitch\r\ncould not possibly have done anything else. And Sophia Antonovna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncocksure and contemptuous \xe2\x80\x9csome police-hound\xe2\x80\x9d was characteristically\r\nRussian in another way. But there was no tragedy there. This was a\r\ncomedy of errors. It was as if the devil himself were playing a game\r\nwith all of them in turn. First with him, then with Ziemianitch,\r\nthen with those revolutionists. The devil\xe2\x80\x99s own game this.... He\r\ninterrupted his earnest mental soliloquy with a jocular thought at his\r\nown expense. \xe2\x80\x9cHallo! I am falling into mysticism too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mind was more at ease than ever. Turning about he put his back\r\nagainst the rail comfortably. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this fits with marvellous aptness,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he continued to think. \xe2\x80\x9cThe brilliance of my reputed exploit is no\r\nlonger darkened by the fate of my supposed colleague. The mystic\r\nZiemianitch accounts for that. An incredible chance has served me. No\r\nmore need of lies. I shall have only to listen and to keep my scorn from\r\ngetting the upper hand of my caution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sighed, folded his arms, his chin dropped on his breast, and it was\r\na long time before he started forward from that pose, with the\r\nrecollection that he had made up his mind to do something important that\r\nday. What it was he could not immediately recall, yet he made no effort\r\nof memory, for he was uneasily certain that he would remember presently.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone more than a hundred yards towards the town when he\r\nslowed down, almost faltered in his walk, at the sight of a figure\r\nwalking in the contrary direction, draped in a cloak, under a soft,\r\nbroad-brimmed hat, picturesque but diminutive, as if seen through the\r\nbig end of an opera-glass. It was impossible to avoid that tiny man, for\r\nthere was no issue for retreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother one going to that mysterious meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov. He was\r\nright in his surmise, only _this_ one, unlike the others who came from a\r\ndistance, was known to him personally. Still, he hoped to pass on with\r\na mere bow, but it was impossible to ignore the little thin hand with\r\nhairy wrist and knuckles protruded in a friendly wave from under the\r\nfolds of the cloak, worn Spanish-wise, in disregard of a fairly warm\r\nday, a corner flung over the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is Herr Razumov?\xe2\x80\x9d sounded the greeting in German, by that alone\r\nmade more odious to the object of the affable recognition. At closer\r\nquarters the diminutive personage looked like a reduction of an\r\nordinary-sized man, with a lofty brow bared for a moment by the raising\r\nof the hat, the great pepper-and salt full beard spread over the\r\nproportionally broad chest. A fine bold nose jutted over a thin mouth\r\nhidden in the mass of fine hair. All this, accented features, strong\r\nlimbs in their relative smallness, appeared delicate without the\r\nslightest sign of debility. The eyes alone, almond-shaped and brown,\r\nwere too big, with the whites slightly bloodshot by much pen labour\r\nunder a lamp. The obscure celebrity of the tiny man was well known to\r\nRazumov. Polyglot, of unknown parentage, of indefinite nationality,\r\nanarchist, with a pedantic and ferocious temperament, and an amazingly\r\ninflammatory capacity for invective, he was a power in the background,\r\nthis violent pamphleteer clamouring for revolutionary justice, this\r\nJulius Laspara, editor of the _Living Word_, confidant of conspirators,\r\ninditer of sanguinary menaces and manifestos, suspected of being in the\r\nsecret of every plot. Laspara lived in the old town in a sombre,\r\nnarrow house presented to him by a naive middle-class admirer of his\r\nhumanitarian eloquence. With him lived his two daughters, who overtopped\r\nhim head and shoulders, and a pasty-faced, lean boy of six, languishing\r\nin the dark rooms in blue cotton overalls and clumsy boots, who might\r\nhave belonged to either one of them or to neither. No stranger could\r\ntell. Julius Laspara no doubt knew which of his girls it was who, after\r\ncasually vanishing for a few years, had as casually returned to him\r\npossessed of that child; but, with admirable pedantry, he had refrained\r\nfrom asking her for details--no, not so much as the name of the father,\r\nbecause maternity should be an anarchist function. Razumov had been\r\nadmitted twice to that suite of several small dark rooms on the top\r\nfloor: dusty window-panes, litter of all sorts of sweepings all over\r\nthe place, half-full glasses of tea forgotten on every table, the two\r\nLaspara daughters prowling about enigmatically silent, sleepy-eyed,\r\ncorsetless, and generally, in their want of shape and the disorder\r\nof their rumpled attire, resembling old dolls; the great but obscure\r\nJulius, his feet twisted round his three-legged stool, always ready to\r\nreceive the visitors, the pen instantly dropped, the body screwed round\r\nwith a striking display of the lofty brow and of the great austere\r\nbeard. When he got down from his stool it was as though he had descended\r\nfrom the heights of Olympus. He was dwarfed by his daughters, by the\r\nfurniture, by any caller of ordinary stature. But he very seldom left\r\nit, and still more rarely was seen walking in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nIt must have been some matter of serious importance which had driven him\r\nout in that direction that afternoon. Evidently he wished to be amiable\r\nto that young man whose arrival had made some sensation in the world\r\nof political refugees. In Russian now, which he spoke, as he spoke and\r\nwrote four or five other European languages, without distinction and\r\nwithout force (other than that of invective), he inquired if Razumov\r\nhad taken his inscriptions at the University as yet. And the young man,\r\nshaking his head negatively--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time for that. But, meantime, are you not going to\r\nwrite something for us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not understand how any one could refrain from writing on\r\nanything, social, economic, historical--anything. Any subject could be\r\ntreated in the right spirit, and for the ends of social revolution. And,\r\nas it happened, a friend of his in London had got in touch with a review\r\nof advanced ideas. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must educate, educate everybody--develop the\r\ngreat thought of absolute liberty and of revolutionary justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov muttered rather surlily that he did not even know English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite in Russian. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have it translated There can be no difficulty.\r\nWhy, without seeking further, there is Miss Haldin. My daughters go to\r\nsee her sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe does nothing, has\r\nnever done anything in her life. She would be quite competent, with a\r\nlittle assistance. Only write. You know you must. And so good-bye for\r\nthe present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his arm and went on. Razumov backed against the low wall,\r\nlooked after him, spat violently, and went on his way with an angry\r\nmutter--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCursed Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not know anything about it. Julius Laspara might have been a\r\nTransylvanian, a Turk, an Andalusian, or a citizen of one of the Hanse\r\ntowns for anything he could tell to the contrary. But this is not a\r\nstory of the West, and this exclamation must be recorded, accompanied by\r\nthe comment that it was merely an expression of hate and contempt, best\r\nadapted to the nature of the feelings Razumov suffered from at the time.\r\nHe was boiling with rage, as though he had been grossly insulted. He\r\nwalked as if blind, following instinctively the shore of the diminutive\r\nharbour along the quay, through a pretty, dull garden, where dull\r\npeople sat on chairs under the trees, till, his fury abandoning him, he\r\ndiscovered himself in the middle of a long, broad bridge. He slowed down\r\nat once. To his right, beyond the toy-like jetties, he saw the green\r\nslopes framing the Petit Lac in all the marvellous banality of the\r\npicturesque made of painted cardboard, with the more distant stretch of\r\nwater inanimate and shining like a piece of tin.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head away from that view for the tourists, and walked on\r\nslowly, his eyes fixed on the ground. One or two persons had to get\r\nout of his way, and then turned round to give a surprised stare to\r\nhis profound absorption. The insistence of the celebrated subversive\r\njournalist rankled in his mind strangely. Write. Must write! He! Write!\r\nA sudden light flashed upon him. To write was the very thing he had made\r\nup his mind to do that day. He had made up his mind irrevocably to that\r\nstep and then had forgotten all about it. That incorrigible tendency to\r\nescape from the grip of the situation was fraught with serious danger.\r\nHe was ready to despise himself for it. What was it? Levity, or\r\ndeep-seated weakness? Or an unconscious dread?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it that I am shrinking? It can\xe2\x80\x99t be! It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible. To shrink now\r\nwould be worse than moral suicide; it would be nothing less than moral\r\ndamnation,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that I have a conventional\r\nconscience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rejected that hypothesis with scorn, and, checked on the edge of the\r\npavement, made ready to cross the road and proceed up the wide street\r\nfacing the head of the bridge; and that for no other reason except that\r\nit was there before him. But at the moment a couple of carriages and a\r\nslow-moving cart interposed, and suddenly he turned sharp to the left,\r\nfollowing the quay again, but now away from the lake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be just my health,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, allowing himself a very unusual\r\ndoubt of his soundness; for, with the exception of a childish ailment\r\nor two, he had never been ill in his life. But that was a danger, too.\r\nOnly, it seemed as though he were being looked after in a specially\r\nremarkable way. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I believed in an active Providence,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov said\r\nto himself, amused grimly, \xe2\x80\x9cI would see here the working of an ironical\r\nfinger. To have a Julius Laspara put in my way as if expressly to remind\r\nme of my purpose is--Write, he had said. I must write--I must, indeed!\r\nI shall write--never fear. Certainly. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I am here. And for the\r\nfuture I shall have something to write about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was exciting himself by this mental soliloquy. But the idea of\r\nwriting evoked the thought of a place to write in, of shelter, of\r\nprivacy, and naturally of his lodgings, mingled with a distaste for the\r\nnecessary exertion of getting there, with a mistrust as of some hostile\r\ninfluence awaiting him within those odious four walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose one of these revolutionists,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwere to take\r\na fancy to call on me while I am writing?\xe2\x80\x9d The mere prospect of such\r\nan interruption made him shudder. One could lock one\xe2\x80\x99s door, or ask\r\nthe tobacconist downstairs (some sort of a refugee himself) to tell\r\ninquirers that one was not in. Not very good precautions those. The\r\nmanner of his life, he felt, must be kept clear of every cause for\r\nsuspicion or even occasion for wonder, down to such trifling occurrences\r\nas a delay in opening a locked door. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I were in the middle of\r\nsome field miles away from everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nHe had unconsciously turned to the left once more and now was aware of\r\nbeing on a bridge again. This one was much narrower than the other, and\r\ninstead of being straight, made a sort of elbow or angle. At the point\r\nof that angle a short arm joined it to a hexagonal islet with a soil of\r\ngravel and its shores faced with dressed stone, a perfection of puerile\r\nneatness. A couple of tall poplars and a few other trees stood grouped\r\non the clean, dark gravel, and under them a few garden benches and a\r\nbronze effigy of Jean Jacques Rousseau seated on its pedestal.\r\n\r\nOn setting his foot on it Razumov became aware that, except for the\r\nwoman in charge of the refreshment chalet, he would be alone on the\r\nisland. There was something of naive, odious, and inane simplicity about\r\nthat unfrequented tiny crumb of earth named after Jean Jacques Rousseau.\r\nSomething pretentious and shabby, too. He asked for a glass of milk,\r\nwhich he drank standing, at one draught (nothing but tea had passed his\r\nlips since the morning), and was going away with a weary, lagging step\r\nwhen a thought stopped him short. He had found precisely what he needed.\r\nIf solitude could ever be secured in the open air in the middle of a\r\ntown, he would have it there on this absurd island, together with the\r\nfaculty of watching the only approach.\r\n\r\nHe went back heavily to a garden seat, dropped into it. This was the\r\nplace for making a beginning of that writing which had to be done. The\r\nmaterials he had on him. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always come here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself,\r\nand afterwards sat for quite a long time motionless, without thought\r\nand sight and hearing, almost without life. He sat long enough for the\r\ndeclining sun to dip behind the roofs of the town at his back, and throw\r\nthe shadow of the houses on the lake front over the islet, before he\r\npulled out of his pocket a fountain pen, opened a small notebook on his\r\nknee, and began to write quickly, raising his eyes now and then at the\r\nconnecting arm of the bridge. These glances were needless; the people\r\ncrossing over in the distance seemed unwilling even to look at the\r\nislet where the exiled effigy of the author of the _Social Contract_ sat\r\nenthroned above the bowed head of Razumov in the sombre immobility of\r\nbronze. After finishing his scribbling, Razumov, with a sort of feverish\r\nhaste, put away the pen, then rammed the notebook into his pocket, first\r\ntearing out the written pages with an almost convulsive brusqueness. But\r\nthe folding of the flimsy batch on his knee was executed with thoughtful\r\nnicety. That done, he leaned back in his seat and remained motionless,\r\nthe papers holding in his left hand. The twilight had deepened. He got\r\nup and began to pace to and fro slowly under the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt that now I am safe,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. His fine ear\r\ncould detect the faintly accentuated murmurs of the current breaking\r\nagainst the point of the island, and he forgot himself in listening to\r\nthem with interest. But even to his acute sense of hearing the sound was\r\ntoo elusive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtraordinary occupation I am giving myself up to,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. And\r\nit occurred to him that this was about the only sound he could listen\r\nto innocently, and for his own pleasure, as it were. Yes, the sound of\r\nwater, the voice of the wind--completely foreign to human passions. All\r\nthe other sounds of this earth brought contamination to the solitude of\r\na soul.\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s feeling, the soul, of course, being his own, and\r\nthe word being used not in the theological sense, but standing, as far\r\nas I can understand it, for that part of Mr. Razumov which was not his\r\nbody, and more specially in danger from the fires of this earth. And it\r\nmust be admitted that in Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s case the bitterness of solitude\r\nfrom which he suffered was not an altogether morbid phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThat I should, at the beginning of this retrospect, mention again that\r\nMr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s youth had no one in the world, as literally no one as it\r\ncan be honestly affirmed of any human being, is but a statement of fact\r\nfrom a man who believes in the psychological value of facts. There\r\nis also, perhaps, a desire of punctilious fairness. Unidentified with\r\nanyone in this narrative where the aspects of honour and shame are\r\nremote from the ideas of the Western world, and taking my stand on the\r\nground of common humanity, it is for that very reason that I feel a\r\nstrange reluctance to state baldly here what every reader has most\r\nlikely already discovered himself. Such reluctance may appear absurd if\r\nit were not for the thought that because of the imperfection of language\r\nthere is always something ungracious (and even disgraceful) in the\r\nexhibition of naked truth. But the time has come when Councillor of\r\nState Mikulin can no longer be ignored. His simple question \xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n on which we left Mr. Razumov in St. Petersburg, throws a light on the\r\ngeneral meaning of this individual case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer in the form of a gentle question to what we\r\nmay call Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of independence. The question was not\r\nmenacing in the least and, indeed, had the ring of innocent inquiry.\r\nHad it been taken in a merely topographical sense, the only answer to it\r\nwould have appeared sufficiently appalling to Mr Razumov. Where to? Back\r\nto his rooms, where the Revolution had sought him out to put to a sudden\r\ntest his dormant instincts, his half-conscious thoughts and almost\r\nwholly unconscious ambitions, by the touch as of some furious and\r\ndogmatic religion, with its call to frantic sacrifices, its tender\r\nresignations, its dreams and hopes uplifting the soul by the side of the\r\nmost sombre moods of despair. And Mr. Razumov had let go the door-handle\r\nand had come back to the middle of the room, asking Councillor Mikulin\r\nangrily, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, Councillor Mikulin did not answer that question.\r\nHe drew Mr. Razumov into familiar conversation. It is the peculiarity of\r\nRussian natures that, however strongly engaged in the drama of action,\r\nthey are still turning their ear to the murmur of abstract ideas. This\r\nconversation (and others later on) need not be recorded. Suffice it to\r\nsay that it brought Mr. Razumov as we know him to the test of another\r\nfaith. There was nothing official in its expression, and Mr. Razumov was\r\nled to defend his attitude of detachment. But Councillor Mikulin would\r\nhave none of his arguments. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a man like you,\xe2\x80\x9d were his last weighty\r\nwords in the discussion, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a position is impossible. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nthat I have seen that interesting piece of paper. I understand your\r\nliberalism. I have an intellect of that kind myself. Reform for me is\r\nmainly a question of method. But the principle of revolt is a physical\r\nintoxication, a sort of hysteria which must be kept away from the\r\nmasses. You agree to this without reserve, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Because, you see,\r\nKirylo Sidorovitch, abstention, reserve, in certain situations, come\r\nvery near to political crime. The ancient Greeks understood that very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Razumov, listening with a faint smile, asked Councillor Mikulin\r\npoint-blank if this meant that he was going to have him watched.\r\n\r\nThe high official took no offence at the cynical inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Kirylo Sidorovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to have you\r\nwatched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, suspecting a lie, affected yet the greatest liberty of mind\r\nduring the short remainder of that interview. The older man expressed\r\nhimself throughout in familiar terms, and with a sort of shrewd\r\nsimplicity. Razumov concluded that to get to the bottom of that mind was\r\nan impossible feat. A great disquiet made his heart beat quicker. The\r\nhigh official, issuing from behind the desk, was actually offering to\r\nshake hands with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Mr Razumov. An understanding between intelligent men is\r\nalways a satisfactory occurrence. Is it not? And, of course, these rebel\r\ngentlemen have not the monopoly of intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume that I shall not be wanted any more?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov brought out\r\nthat question while his hand was still being grasped. Councillor Mikulin\r\nreleased it slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, Mr. Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with great earnestness, \xe2\x80\x9cis as it may\r\nbe. God alone knows the future. But you may rest assured that I\r\nnever thought of having you watched. You are a young man of great\r\nindependence. Yes. You are going away free as air, but you shall end by\r\ncoming back to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! I!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov exclaimed in an appalled murmur of protest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! You yourself, Kirylo Sidorovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d the high police functionary\r\ninsisted in a low, severe tone of conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be coming back\r\nto us. Some of our greatest minds had to do that in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no better friend than Prince K---, and as to myself it is a\r\nlong time now since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been honoured by his....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced down his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you any longer. We live in difficult times, in times\r\nof monstrous chimeras and evil dreams and criminal follies. We shall\r\ncertainly meet once more. It may be some little time, though, before\r\nwe do. Till then may Heaven send you fruitful reflections!\xe2\x80\x9d Once in the\r\nstreet, Razumov started off rapidly, without caring for the direction.\r\nAt first he thought of nothing; but in a little while the consciousness\r\nof his position presented itself to him as something so ugly, dangerous,\r\nand absurd, the difficulty of ever freeing himself from the toils of\r\nthat complication so insoluble, that the idea of going back and, as he\r\ntermed it to himself, confessing to Councillor Mikulin flashed through\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nGo back! What for? Confess! To what? \xe2\x80\x9cI have been speaking to him with\r\nthe greatest openness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself with perfect truth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nelse could I tell him? That I have undertaken to carry a message to that\r\nbrute Ziemianitch? Establish a false complicity and destroy what chance\r\nof safety I have won for nothing--what folly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet he could not defend himself from fancying that Councillor Mikulin\r\nwas, perhaps, the only man in the world able to understand his conduct.\r\nTo be understood appeared extremely fascinating.\r\n\r\nOn the way home he had to stop several times; all his strength seemed to\r\nrun out of his limbs; and in the movement of the busy streets, isolated\r\nas if in a desert, he remained suddenly motionless for a minute or so\r\nbefore he could proceed on his way. He reached his rooms at last.\r\n\r\nThen came an illness, something in the nature of a low fever, which all\r\nat once removed him to a great distance from the perplexing actualities,\r\nfrom his very room, even. He never lost consciousness; he only seemed to\r\nhimself to be existing languidly somewhere very far away from everything\r\nthat had ever happened to him. He came out of this state slowly, with an\r\neffect, that is to say, of extreme slowness, though the actual number\r\nof days was not very great. And when he had got back into the middle of\r\nthings they were all changed, subtly and provokingly in their nature:\r\ninanimate objects, human faces, the landlady, the rustic servant-girl,\r\nthe staircase, the streets, the very air. He tackled these changed\r\nconditions in a spirit of severity. He walked to and fro to the\r\nUniversity, ascended stairs, paced the passages, listened to lectures,\r\ntook notes, crossed courtyards in angry aloofness, his teeth set hard\r\ntill his jaws ached.\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly aware of madcap Kostia gazing like a young retriever\r\nfrom a distance, of the famished student with the red drooping nose,\r\nkeeping scrupulously away as desired; of twenty others, perhaps, he\r\nknew well enough to speak to. And they all had an air of curiosity and\r\nconcern as if they expected something to happen. \xe2\x80\x9cThis can\xe2\x80\x99t last much\r\nlonger,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov more than once. On certain days he was afraid\r\nthat anyone addressing him suddenly in a certain way would make him\r\nscream out insanely a lot of filthy abuse. Often, after returning home,\r\nhe would drop into a chair in his cap and cloak and remain still for\r\nhours holding some book he had got from the library in his hand; or\r\nhe would pick up the little penknife and sit there scraping his nails\r\nendlessly and feeling furious all the time--simply furious. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nimpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he would mutter suddenly to the empty room.\r\n\r\nFact to be noted: this room might conceivably have become physically\r\nrepugnant to him, emotionally intolerable, morally uninhabitable.\r\nBut no. Nothing of the sort (and he had himself dreaded it at first),\r\nnothing of the sort happened. On the contrary, he liked his lodgings\r\nbetter than any other shelter he, who had never known a home, had ever\r\nhired before. He liked his lodgings so well that often, on that very\r\naccount, he found a certain difficulty in making up his mind to go out.\r\nIt resembled a physical seduction such as, for instance, makes a man\r\nreluctant to leave the neighbourhood of a fire on a cold day.\r\n\r\nFor as, at that time, he seldom stirred except to go to the University\r\n(what else was there to do?) it followed that whenever he went abroad he\r\nfelt himself at once closely involved in the moral consequences of his\r\nact. It was there that the dark prestige of the Haldin mystery fell on\r\nhim, clung to him like a poisoned robe it was impossible to fling off.\r\nHe suffered from it exceedingly, as well as from the conversational,\r\ncommonplace, unavoidable intercourse with the other kind of students.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be wondering at the change in me,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected anxiously. He\r\nhad an uneasy recollection of having savagely told one or two innocent,\r\nnice enough fellows to go to the devil. Once a married professor he used\r\nto call upon formerly addressed him in passing: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it we never see\r\nyou at our Wednesdays now, Kirylo Sidorovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov was conscious of\r\nmeeting this advance with odious, muttering boorishness. The professor\r\nwas obviously too astonished to be offended. All this was bad. And all\r\nthis was Haldin, always Haldin--nothing but Haldin--everywhere Haldin:\r\na moral spectre infinitely more effective than any visible apparition of\r\nthe dead. It was only the room through which that man had blundered on\r\nhis way from crime to death that his spectre did not seem to be able to\r\nhaunt. Not, to be exact, that he was ever completely absent from it,\r\nbut that there he had no sort of power. There it was Razumov who had\r\nthe upper hand, in a composed sense of his own superiority. A vanquished\r\nphantom--nothing more. Often in the evening, his repaired watch faintly\r\nticking on the table by the side of the lighted lamp, Razumov would\r\nlook up from his writing and stare at the bed with an expectant,\r\ndispassionate attention. Nothing was to be seen there. He never really\r\nsupposed that anything ever could be seen there. After a while he would\r\nshrug his shoulders slightly and bend again over his work. For he had\r\ngone to work and, at first, with some success. His unwillingness to\r\nleave that place where he was safe from Haldin grew so strong that at\r\nlast he ceased to go out at all. From early morning till far into the\r\nnight he wrote, he wrote for nearly a week; never looking at the time,\r\nand only throwing himself on the bed when he could keep his eyes open\r\nno longer. Then, one afternoon, quite casually, he happened to glance at\r\nhis watch. He laid down his pen slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this very hour,\xe2\x80\x9d was his thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fellow stole unseen into this\r\nroom while I was out. And there he sat quiet as a mouse--perhaps in\r\nthis very chair.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov got up and began to pace the floor steadily,\r\nglancing at the watch now and then. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the time when I returned\r\nand found him standing against the stove,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed to himself. When\r\nit grew dark he lit his lamp. Later on he interrupted his tramping once\r\nmore, only to wave away angrily the girl who attempted to enter the\r\nroom with tea and something to eat on a tray. And presently he noted the\r\nwatch pointing at the hour of his own going forth into the falling snow\r\non that terrible errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComplicity,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered faintly, and resumed his pacing, keeping his\r\neye on the hands as they crept on slowly to the time of his return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI might have been the chosen\r\ninstrument of Providence. This is a manner of speaking, but there may be\r\ntruth in every manner of speaking. What if that absurd saying were true\r\nin its essence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe meditated for a while, then sat down, his legs stretched out, with\r\nstony eyes, and with his arms hanging down on each side of the chair\r\nlike a man totally abandoned by Providence--desolate.\r\n\r\nHe noted the time of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s departure and continued to sit still for\r\nanother half-hour; then muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now to work,\xe2\x80\x9d drew up to the\r\ntable, seized the pen and instantly dropped it under the influence of a\r\nprofoundly disquieting reflection: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s three weeks gone by and no\r\nword from Mikulin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean! Was he forgotten? Possibly. Then why not remain\r\nforgotten--creep in somewhere? Hide. But where? How? With whom? In what\r\nhole? And was it to be for ever, or what?\r\n\r\nBut a retreat was big with shadowy dangers. The eye of the social\r\nrevolution was on him, and Razumov for a moment felt an unnamed and\r\ndespairing dread, mingled with an odious sense of humiliation. Was it\r\npossible that he no longer belonged to himself? This was damnable.\r\nBut why not simply keep on as before? Study. Advance. Work hard as if\r\nnothing had happened (and first of all win the Silver Medal), acquire\r\ndistinction, become a great reforming servant of the greatest of States.\r\nServant, too, of the mightiest homogeneous mass of mankind with a\r\ncapability for logical, guided development in a brotherly solidarity\r\nof force and aim such as the world had never dreamt of... the Russian\r\nnation!\r\n\r\nCalm, resolved, steady in his great purpose, he was stretching his hand\r\ntowards the pen when he happened to glance towards the bed. He rushed at\r\nit, enraged, with a mental scream: \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s you, crazy fanatic, who stands\r\nin the way!\xe2\x80\x9d He flung the pillow on the floor violently, tore the\r\nblankets aside.... Nothing there. And, turning away, he caught for\r\nan instant in the air, like a vivid detail in a dissolving view of two\r\nheads, the eyes of General T--- and of Privy-Councillor Mikulin side\r\nby side fixed upon him, quite different in character, but with the same\r\nunflinching and weary and yet purposeful expression...servants of the\r\nnation!\r\n\r\nRazumov tottered to the washstand very alarmed about himself, drank some\r\nwater and bathed his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cThis will pass and leave no trace,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cI am all right.\xe2\x80\x9d But as to supposing that he had\r\nbeen forgotten it was perfect nonsense. He was a marked man on that\r\nside. And that was nothing. It was what that miserable phantom stood for\r\nwhich had to be got out of the way.... \xe2\x80\x9cIf one only could go and spit\r\nit all out at some of them--and take the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe imagined himself accosting the red-nosed student and suddenly shaking\r\nhis fist in his face. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom that one, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to be got, because he has no mind of his own. He\xe2\x80\x99s living in\r\na red democratic trance. Ah! you want to smash your way into universal\r\nhappiness, my boy. I will give you universal happiness, you silly,\r\nhypnotized ghoul, you! And what about my own happiness, eh? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\ngot any right to it, just because I can think for myself?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again, but with a different mental accent, Razumov said to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am young. Everything can be lived down.\xe2\x80\x9d At that moment he was\r\ncrossing the room slowly, intending to sit down on the sofa and try to\r\ncompose his thoughts. But before he had got so far everything abandoned\r\nhim--hope, courage, belief in himself trust in men. His heart had, as it\r\nwere, suddenly emptied itself. It was no use struggling on. Rest, work,\r\nsolitude, and the frankness of intercourse with his kind were alike\r\nforbidden to him. Everything was gone. His existence was a great cold\r\nblank, something like the enormous plain of the whole of Russia levelled\r\nwith snow and fading gradually on all sides into shadows and mists.\r\n\r\nHe sat down, with swimming head, closed his eyes, and remained like\r\nthat, sitting bolt upright on the sofa and perfectly awake for the\r\nrest of the night; till the girl bustling into the outer room with\r\nthe samovar thumped with her fist on the door, calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cKirylo\r\nSidorovitch, please! It is time for you to get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, pale like a corpse obeying the dread summons of judgement, Razumov\r\nopened his eyes and got up.\r\n\r\n\r\nNobody will be surprised to hear, I suppose, that when the summons came\r\nhe went to see Councillor Mikulin. It came that very morning, while,\r\nlooking white and shaky, like an invalid just out of bed, he was trying\r\nto shave himself. The envelope was addressed in the little attorney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting. That envelope contained another, superscribed to Razumov,\r\nin Prince K---\xe2\x80\x98s hand, with the request \xe2\x80\x9cPlease forward under cover\r\nat once\xe2\x80\x9d in a corner. The note inside was an autograph of Councillor\r\nMikulin. The writer stated candidly that nothing had arisen which needed\r\nclearing up, but nevertheless appointed a meeting with Mr. Razumov at a\r\ncertain address in town which seemed to be that of an oculist.\r\n\r\nRazumov read it, finished shaving, dressed, looked at the note again,\r\nand muttered gloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cOculist.\xe2\x80\x9d He pondered over it for a time, lit\r\na match, and burned the two envelopes and the enclosure carefully.\r\nAfterwards he waited, sitting perfectly idle and not even looking at\r\nanything in particular till the appointed hour drew near--and then went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nWhether, looking at the unofficial character of the summons, he might\r\nhave refrained from attending to it is hard to say. Probably not. At any\r\nrate, he went; but, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, he went with a certain eagerness, which\r\nmay appear incredible till it is remembered that Councillor Mikulin was\r\nthe only person on earth with whom Razumov could talk, taking the Haldin\r\nadventure for granted. And Haldin, when once taken for granted, was no\r\nlonger a haunting, falsehood-breeding spectre. Whatever troubling power\r\nhe exercised in all the other places of the earth, Razumov knew very\r\nwell that at this oculist\xe2\x80\x99s address he would be merely the hanged\r\nmurderer of M. de P--- and nothing more. For the dead can live only\r\nwith the exact intensity and quality of the life imparted to them by\r\nthe living. So Mr. Razumov, certain of relief, went to meet Councillor\r\nMikulin with the eagerness of a pursued person welcoming any sort of\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nThis much said, there is no need to tell anything more of that first\r\ninterview and of the several others. To the morality of a Western reader\r\nan account of these meetings would wear perhaps the sinister character\r\nof old legendary tales where the Enemy of Mankind is represented holding\r\nsubtly mendacious dialogues with some tempted soul. It is not my part to\r\nprotest. Let me but remark that the Evil One, with his single passion\r\nof satanic pride for the only motive, is yet, on a larger, modern view,\r\nallowed to be not quite so black as he used to be painted. With what\r\ngreater latitude, then, should we appraise the exact shade of mere\r\nmortal man, with his many passions and his miserable ingenuity in error,\r\nalways dazzled by the base glitter of mixed motives, everlastingly\r\nbetrayed by a short-sighted wisdom.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin was one of those powerful officials who, in a\r\nposition not obscure, not occult, but simply inconspicuous, exercise\r\na great influence over the methods rather than over the conduct of\r\naffairs. A devotion to Church and Throne is not in itself a criminal\r\nsentiment; to prefer the will of one to the will of many does not argue\r\nthe possession of a black heart or prove congenital idiocy. Councillor\r\nMikulin was not only a clever but also a faithful official. Privately he\r\nwas a bachelor with a love of comfort, living alone in an apartment of\r\nfive rooms luxuriously furnished; and was known by his intimates to be\r\nan enlightened patron of the art of female dancing. Later on the larger\r\nworld first heard of him in the very hour of his downfall, during one of\r\nthose State trials which astonish and puzzle the average plain man who\r\nreads the newspapers, by a glimpse of unsuspected intrigues. And in\r\nthe stir of vaguely seen monstrosities, in that momentary, mysterious\r\ndisturbance of muddy waters, Councillor Mikulin went under, dignified,\r\nwith only a calm, emphatic protest of his innocence--nothing more. No\r\ndisclosures damaging to a harassed autocracy, complete fidelity to the\r\nsecrets of the miserable _arcana imperii_ deposited in his patriotic\r\nbreast, a display of bureaucratic stoicism in a Russian official\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nineradicable, almost sublime contempt for truth; stoicism of silence\r\nunderstood only by the very few of the initiated, and not without a\r\ncertain cynical grandeur of self-sacrifice on the part of a sybarite.\r\nFor the terribly heavy sentence turned Councillor Mikulin civilly into a\r\ncorpse, and actually into something very much like a common convict.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the savage autocracy, no more than the divine democracy,\r\ndoes not limit its diet exclusively to the bodies of its enemies. It\r\ndevours its friends and servants as well. The downfall of His Excellency\r\nGregory Gregorievitch Mikulin (which did not occur till some years\r\nlater) completes all that is known of the man. But at the time of M. de\r\nP---\xe2\x80\x98s murder (or execution) Councillor Mikulin, under the modest style\r\nof Head of Department at the General Secretariat, exercised a wide\r\ninfluence as the confidant and right-hand man of his former schoolfellow\r\nand lifelong friend, General T---. One can imagine them talking over the\r\ncase of Mr. Razumov, with the full sense of their unbounded power\r\nover all the lives in Russia, with cursory disdain, like two Olympians\r\nglancing at a worm. The relationship with Prince K--- was enough to save\r\nRazumov from some carelessly arbitrary proceeding, and it is also very\r\nprobable that after the interview at the Secretariat he would have been\r\nleft alone. Councillor Mikulin would not have forgotten him (he forgot\r\nno one who ever fell under his observation), but would have simply\r\ndropped him for ever. Councillor Mikulin was a good-natured man and\r\nwished no harm to anyone. Besides (with his own reforming tendencies) he\r\nwas favourably impressed by that young student, the son of Prince K---,\r\nand apparently no fool.\r\n\r\nBut as fate would have it, while Mr. Razumov was finding that no way of\r\nlife was possible to him, Councillor Mikulin\xe2\x80\x99s discreet abilities were\r\nrewarded by a very responsible post--nothing less than the direction of\r\nthe general police supervision over Europe. And it was then, and then\r\nonly, when taking in hand the perfecting of the service which watches\r\nthe revolutionist activities abroad, that he thought again of Mr.\r\nRazumov. He saw great possibilities of special usefulness in that\r\nuncommon young man on whom he had a hold already, with his peculiar\r\ntemperament, his unsettled mind and shaken conscience, a struggling in\r\nthe toils of a false position.... It was as if the revolutionists\r\nthemselves had put into his hand that tool so much finer than the common\r\nbase instruments, so perfectly fitted, if only vested with sufficient\r\ncredit, to penetrate into places inaccessible to common informers.\r\nProvidential! Providential! And Prince K---, taken into the secret, was\r\nready enough to adopt that mystical view too. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be necessary,\r\nthough, to make a career for him afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d he had stipulated\r\nanxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! absolutely. We shall make that our affair,\xe2\x80\x9d Mikulin had\r\nagreed. Prince K---\xe2\x80\x98s mysticism was of an artless kind; but Councillor\r\nMikulin was astute enough for two.\r\n\r\nThings and men have always a certain sense, a certain side by which they\r\nmust be got hold of if one wants to obtain a solid grasp and a perfect\r\ncommand. The power of Councillor Mikulin consisted in the ability to\r\nseize upon that sense, that side in the men he used. It did not matter\r\nto him what it was--vanity, despair, love, hate, greed, intelligent\r\npride or stupid conceit, it was all one to him as long as the man could\r\nbe made to serve. The obscure, unrelated young student Razumov, in the\r\nmoment of great moral loneliness, was allowed to feel that he was an\r\nobject of interest to a small group of people of high position. Prince\r\nK--- was persuaded to intervene personally, and on a certain occasion\r\ngave way to a manly emotion which, all unexpected as it was, quite upset\r\nMr. Razumov. The sudden embrace of that man, agitated by his loyalty to\r\na throne and by suppressed paternal affection, was a revelation to Mr.\r\nRazumov of something within his own breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that was it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed to himself. A sort of contemptuous\r\ntenderness softened the young man\xe2\x80\x99s grim view of his position as\r\nhe reflected upon that agitated interview with Prince K---. This\r\nsimpleminded, worldly ex-Guardsman and senator whose soft grey official\r\nwhiskers had brushed against his cheek, his aristocratic and convinced\r\nfather, was he a whit less estimable or more absurd than that\r\nfamine-stricken, fanatical revolutionist, the red-nosed student?\r\n\r\nAnd there was some pressure, too, besides the persuasiveness. Mr.\r\nRazumov was always being made to feel that he had committed himself.\r\nThere was no getting away from that feeling, from that soft,\r\nunanswerable, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d of Councillor Mikulin. But no susceptibilities\r\nwere ever hurt. It was to be a dangerous mission to Geneva for\r\nobtaining, at a critical moment, absolutely reliable information from a\r\nvery inaccessible quarter of the inner revolutionary circle. There were\r\nindications that a very serious plot was being matured.... The repose\r\nindispensable to a great country was at stake.... A great scheme of\r\norderly reforms would be endangered.... The highest personages in the\r\nland were patriotically uneasy, and so on. In short, Councillor Mikulin\r\nknew what to say. This skill is to be inferred clearly from the mental\r\nand psychological self-confession, self-analysis of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwritten journal--the pitiful resource of a young man who had near him no\r\ntrusted intimacy, no natural affection to turn to.\r\n\r\nHow all this preliminary work was concealed from observation need not\r\nbe recorded. The expedient of the oculist gives a sufficient instance.\r\nCouncillor Mikulin was resourceful, and the task not very difficult. Any\r\nfellow-student, even the red-nosed one, was perfectly welcome to see Mr.\r\nRazumov entering a private house to consult an oculist. Ultimate success\r\ndepended solely on the revolutionary self-delusion which credited\r\nRazumov with a mysterious complicity in the Haldin affair. To be\r\ncompromised in it was credit enough-and it was their own doing. It was\r\nprecisely _that_ which stamped Mr. Razumov as a providential man, wide\r\nas poles apart from the usual type of agent for \xe2\x80\x9cEuropean supervision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it was _that_ which the Secretariat set itself the task to foster by\r\na course of calculated and false indiscretions.\r\n\r\nIt came at last to this, that one evening Mr. Razumov was unexpectedly\r\ncalled upon by one of the \xe2\x80\x9cthinking\xe2\x80\x9d students whom formerly, before\r\nthe Haldin affair, he used to meet at various private gatherings; a big\r\nfellow with a quiet, unassuming manner and a pleasant voice.\r\n\r\nRecognizing his voice raised in the ante-room, \xe2\x80\x9cMay one come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumov, lounging idly on his couch, jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose he were coming\r\nto stab me?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought sardonically, and, assuming a green shade over\r\nhis left eye, said in a severe tone, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other was embarrassed; hoped he was not intruding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been seen for several days, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered.\xe2\x80\x9d He coughed\r\na little. \xe2\x80\x9cEye better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly well now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. I won\xe2\x80\x99t stop a minute; but you see I, that is, we--anyway, I\r\nhave undertaken the duty to warn you, Kirylo Sidorovitch, that you are\r\nliving in false security maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov sat still with his head leaning on his hand, which nearly\r\nconcealed the unshaded eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have that idea, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, then. Everything seems quiet now, but those people\r\nare preparing some move of general repression. That\xe2\x80\x99s of course. But it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t that I came to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d He hitched his chair closer, dropped his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be arrested before long--we fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn obscure scribe in the Secretariat had overheard a few words of a\r\ncertain conversation, and had caught a glimpse of a certain report. This\r\nintelligence was not to be neglected.\r\n\r\nRazumov laughed a little, and his visitor became very anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Kirylo Sidorovitch, this is no laughing matter. They have left you\r\nalone for a while, but...! Indeed, you had better try to leave the\r\ncountry, Kirylo Sidorovitch, while there\xe2\x80\x99s yet time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov jumped up and began to thank him for the advice with mocking\r\neffusiveness, so that the other, colouring up, took himself off with\r\nthe notion that this mysterious Razumov was not a person to be warned or\r\nadvised by inferior mortals.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin, informed the next day of the incident, expressed\r\nhis satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! Ha! Exactly what was wanted to...\xe2\x80\x9d and glanced\r\ndown his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conclude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the moment has come for me to start on\r\nmy mission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe psychological Moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Councillor Mikulin insisted softly--very\r\ngravely--as if awed.\r\n\r\nAll the arrangements to give verisimilitude to the appearance of a\r\ndifficult escape were made. Councillor Mikulin did not expect to see\r\nMr. Razumov again before his departure. These meetings were a risk, and\r\nthere was nothing more to settle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have said everything to each other by now, Kirylo Sidorovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the high official feelingly, pressing Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s hand with that\r\nunreserved heartiness a Russian can convey in his manner. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nnothing obscure between us. And I will tell you what! I consider myself\r\nfortunate in having--h\xe2\x80\x99m--your...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced down his beard, and, after a moment of thoughtful silence,\r\nhanded to Razumov a half-sheet of notepaper--an abbreviated note of\r\nmatters already discussed, certain points of inquiry, the line of\r\nconduct agreed on, a few hints as to personalities, and so on. It was\r\nthe only compromising document in the case, but, as Councillor Mikulin\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cit could be easily destroyed. Mr. Razumov had better not see\r\nany one now--till on the other side of the frontier, when, of course, it\r\nwill be just that.... See and hear and...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced down his beard; but when Razumov declared his intention\r\nto see one person at least before leaving St. Petersburg, Councillor\r\nMikulin failed to conceal a sudden uneasiness. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s studious,\r\nsolitary, and austere existence was well known to him. It was the\r\ngreatest guarantee of fitness. He became deprecatory. Had his dear\r\nKirylo Sidorovitch considered whether, in view of such a momentous\r\nenterprise, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really advisable to sacrifice every sentiment....\r\n\r\nRazumov interrupted the remonstrance scornfully. It was not a young\r\nwoman, it was a young fool he wished to see for a certain purpose.\r\nCouncillor Mikulin was relieved, but surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! And what for--precisely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of improving the aspect of verisimilitude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov\r\ncurtly, in a desire to affirm his independence. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be trusted in\r\nwhat I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCouncillor Mikulin gave way tactfully, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly,\r\ncertainly. Your judgment...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with another handshake they parted.\r\n\r\nThe fool of whom Mr. Razumov had thought was the rich and festive\r\nstudent known as madcap Kostia. Feather-headed, loquacious, excitable,\r\none could make certain of his utter and complete indiscretion. But that\r\nriotous youth, when reminded by Razumov of his offers of service some\r\ntime ago, passed from his usual elation into boundless dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Kirylo Sidorovitch, my dearest friend--my saviour--what shall I\r\ndo? I\xe2\x80\x99ve blown last night every rouble I had from my dad the other day.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t you give me till Thursday? I shall rush round to all the usurers\r\nI know.... No, of course, you can\xe2\x80\x99t! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that.\r\nWhat shall I do? No use asking the old man. I tell you he\xe2\x80\x99s given me a\r\nfistful of big notes three days ago. Miserable wretch that I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrung his hands in despair. Impossible to confide in the old man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x9d had given him a decoration, a cross on the neck only last year,\r\nand he had been cursing the modern tendencies ever since. Just then he\r\nwould see all the intellectuals in Russia hanged in a row rather than\r\npart with a single rouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirylo Sidorovitch, wait a moment. Don\xe2\x80\x99t despise me. I have it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll,\r\nyes--I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it--I\xe2\x80\x99ll break into his desk. There\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it. I\r\nknow the drawer where he keeps his plunder, and I can buy a chisel on my\r\nway home. He will be terribly upset, but, you know, the dear old duffer\r\nreally loves me. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get over it--and I, too. Kirylo, my dear\r\nsoul, if you can only wait for a few hours-till this evening--I shall\r\nsteal all the blessed lot I can lay my hands on! You doubt me! Why?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only to say the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteal, by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov, fixing him stonily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the devil with the ten commandments!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, with the\r\ngreatest animation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the new future now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when he entered Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s room late in the evening it was with an\r\nunaccustomed soberness of manner, almost solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nRazumov sitting bowed, his clasped hands hanging between his knees,\r\nshuddered at the familiar sound of these words. Kostia deposited slowly\r\nin the circle of lamplight a small brown-paper parcel tied with a piece\r\nof string.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve said--all I could lay my hands on. The old boy\xe2\x80\x99ll think the end\r\nof the world has come.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov nodded from the couch, and contemplated\r\nthe hare-brained fellow\xe2\x80\x99s gravity with a feeling of malicious pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made my little sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed mad Kostia. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve to thank\r\nyou, Kirylo Sidorovitch, for the opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has cost you something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it has. You see, the dear old duffer really loves me. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nhurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you believe all they tell you of the new future and the sacred will\r\nof the people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImplicitly. I would give my life.... Only, you see, I am like a pig\r\nat a trough. I am no good. It\xe2\x80\x99s my nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov, lost in thought, had forgotten his existence till the\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x99s voice, entreating him to fly without loss of time, roused him\r\nunpleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Well--good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to leave you till I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you out of St. Petersburg,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n declared Kostia unexpectedly, with calm determination. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t refuse\r\nme that now. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Kirylo, my soul, the police may be here\r\nany moment, and when they get you they\xe2\x80\x99ll immure you somewhere for\r\nages--till your hair turns grey. I have down there the best trotter of\r\ndad\xe2\x80\x99s stables and a light sledge. We shall do thirty miles before the\r\nmoon sets, and find some roadside station....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov looked up amazed. The journey was decided--unavoidable. He\r\nhad fixed the next day for his departure on the mission. And now he\r\ndiscovered suddenly that he had not believed in it. He had gone about\r\nlistening, speaking, thinking, planning his simulated flight, with the\r\ngrowing conviction that all this was preposterous. As if anybody ever\r\ndid such things! It was like a game of make-believe. And now he was\r\namazed! Here was somebody who believed in it with desperate earnestness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t go now, at once,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov, with a start of fear, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall never go.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose without a word, and the anxious Kostia thrust\r\nhis cap on him, helped him into his cloak, or else he would have left\r\nthe room bareheaded as he stood. He was walking out silently when a\r\nsharp cry arrested him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirylo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned reluctantly in the doorway. Upright, with a stiffly\r\nextended arm, Kostia, his face set and white, was pointing an eloquent\r\nforefinger at the brown little packet lying forgotten in the circle of\r\nbright light on the table. Razumov hesitated, came back for it under the\r\nsevere eyes of his companion, at whom he tried to smile. But the boyish,\r\nmad youth was frowning. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov, putting the\r\nlittle parcel into his pocket and descending the stairs; \xe2\x80\x9cnobody does\r\nsuch things.\xe2\x80\x9d The other held him under the arm, whispering of\r\ndangers ahead, and of what he meant to do in certain contingencies.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreposterous,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Razumov, as he was being tucked up in the\r\nsledge. He gave himself up to watching the development of the dream\r\nwith extreme attention. It continued on foreseen lines, inexorably\r\nlogical--the long drive, the wait at the small station sitting by a\r\nstove. They did not exchange half a dozen words altogether. Kostia,\r\ngloomy himself, did not care to break the silence. At parting they\r\nembraced twice--it had to be done; and then Kostia vanished out of the\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nWhen dawn broke, Razumov, very still in a hot, stuffy railway-car full\r\nof bedding and of sleeping people in all its dimly lighted length, rose\r\nquietly, lowered the glass a few inches, and flung out on the great\r\nplain of snow a small brown-paper parcel. Then he sat down again muffled\r\nup and motionless. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the people,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, staring out of the\r\nwindow. The great white desert of frozen, hard earth glided past his\r\neyes without a sign of human habitation.\r\n\r\nThat had been a waking act; and then the dream had him again: Prussia,\r\nSaxony, Wurtemberg, faces, sights, words--all a dream, observed with\r\nan angry, compelled attention. Zurich, Geneva--still a dream, minutely\r\nfollowed, wearing one into harsh laughter, to fury, to death--with the\r\nfear of awakening at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps life is just that,\xe2\x80\x9d reflected Razumov, pacing to and fro under\r\nthe trees of the little island, all alone with the bronze statue of\r\nRousseau. \xe2\x80\x9cA dream and a fear.\xe2\x80\x9d The dusk deepened. The pages written\r\nover and torn out of his notebook were the first-fruit of his \xe2\x80\x9cmission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n No dream that. They contained the assurance that he was on the eve of\r\nreal discoveries. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there is no longer anything in the way of my\r\nbeing completely accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had resumed his impressions in those pages, some of the\r\nconversations. He even went so far as to write: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the by, I have\r\ndiscovered the personality of that terrible N.N. A horrible, paunchy\r\nbrute. If I hear anything of his future movements I shall send a\r\nwarning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe futility of all this overcame him like a curse. Even then he could\r\nnot believe in the reality of his mission. He looked round despairingly,\r\nas if for some way to redeem his existence from that unconquerable\r\nfeeling. He crushed angrily in his hand the pages of the notebook. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nmust be posted,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nHe gained the bridge and returned to the north shore, where he\r\nremembered having seen in one of the narrower streets a little obscure\r\nshop stocked with cheap wood carvings, its walls lined with extremely\r\ndirty cardboard-bound volumes of a small circulating library. They\r\nsold stationery there, too. A morose, shabby old man dozed behind\r\nthe counter. A thin woman in black, with a sickly face, produced the\r\nenvelope he had asked for without even looking at him. Razumov thought\r\nthat these people were safe to deal with because they no longer cared\r\nfor anything in the world. He addressed the envelope on the counter with\r\nthe German name of a certain person living in Vienna. But Razumov knew\r\nthat this, his first communication for Councillor Mikulin, would\r\nfind its way to the Embassy there, be copied in cypher by somebody\r\ntrustworthy, and sent on to its destination, all safe, along with the\r\ndiplomatic correspondence. That was the arrangement contrived to cover\r\nup the track of the information from all unfaithful eyes, from all\r\nindiscretions, from all mishaps and treacheries. It was to make him\r\nsafe--absolutely safe.\r\n\r\nHe wandered out of the wretched shop and made for the post office. It\r\nwas then that I saw him for the second time that day. He was crossing\r\nthe Rue Mont Blanc with every appearance of an aimless stroller. He\r\ndid not recognize me, but I made him out at some distance. He was\r\nvery good-looking, I thought, this remarkable friend of Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother. I watched him go up to the letter-box and then retrace his\r\nsteps. Again he passed me very close, but I am certain he did not see\r\nme that time, either. He carried his head well up, but he had the\r\nexpression of a somnambulist struggling with the very dream which drives\r\nhim forth to wander in dangerous places. My thoughts reverted to Natalia\r\nHaldin, to her mother. He was all that was left to them of their son and\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe westerner in me was discomposed. There was something shocking in\r\nthe expression of that face. Had I been myself a conspirator, a Russian\r\npolitical refugee, I could have perhaps been able to draw some practical\r\nconclusion from this chance glimpse. As it was, it only discomposed me\r\nstrongly, even to the extent of awakening an indefinite apprehension in\r\nregard to Natalia Haldin. All this is rather inexplicable, but such\r\nwas the origin of the purpose I formed there and then to call on these\r\nladies in the evening, after my solitary dinner. It was true that I had\r\nmet Miss Haldin only a few hours before, but Mrs. Haldin herself I had\r\nnot seen for some considerable time. The truth is, I had shirked calling\r\nof late.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Haldin! I confess she frightened me a little. She was one\r\nof those natures, rare enough, luckily, in which one cannot help being\r\ninterested, because they provoke both terror and pity. One dreads their\r\ncontact for oneself, and still more for those one cares for, so clear\r\nit is that they are born to suffer and to make others suffer, too. It is\r\nstrange to think that, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say liberty, but the mere liberalism of\r\noutlook which for us is a matter of words, of ambitions, of votes (and\r\nif of feeling at all, then of the sort of feeling which leaves our\r\ndeepest affections untouched), may be for other beings very much like\r\nourselves and living under the same sky, a heavy trial of fortitude, a\r\nmatter of tears and anguish and blood. Mrs. Haldin had felt the pangs\r\nof her own generation. There was that enthusiast brother of hers--the\r\nofficer they shot under Nicholas. A faintly ironic resignation is\r\nno armour for a vulnerable heart. Mrs. Haldin, struck at through her\r\nchildren, was bound to suffer afresh from the past, and to feel the\r\nanguish of the future. She was of those who do not know how to heal\r\nthemselves, of those who are too much aware of their heart, who, neither\r\ncowardly nor selfish, look passionately at its wounds--and count the\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts as these seasoned my modest, lonely bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s meal. If\r\nanybody wishes to remark that this was a roundabout way of thinking of\r\nNatalia Haldin, I can only retort that she was well worth some concern.\r\nShe had all her life before her. Let it be admitted, then, that I was\r\nthinking of Natalia Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s life in terms of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s character, a\r\nmanner of thinking about a girl permissible for an old man, not too old\r\nyet to have become a stranger to pity. There was almost all her youth\r\nbefore her; a youth robbed arbitrarily of its natural lightness and joy,\r\novershadowed by an un-European despotism; a terribly sombre youth\r\ngiven over to the hazards of a furious strife between equally ferocious\r\nantagonisms.\r\n\r\nI lingered over my thoughts more than I should have done. One felt so\r\nhelpless, and even worse--so unrelated, in a way. At the last moment I\r\nhesitated as to going there at all. What was the good?\r\n\r\nThe evening was already advanced when, turning into the Boulevard des\r\nPhilosophes, I saw the light in the window at the corner. The blind was\r\ndown, but I could imagine behind it Mrs. Haldin seated in the chair, in\r\nher usual attitude, looking out for some one, which had lately acquired\r\nthe poignant quality of mad expectation.\r\n\r\nI thought that I was sufficiently authorized by the light to knock at\r\nthe door. The ladies had not retired as yet. I only hoped they would\r\nnot have any visitors of their own nationality. A broken-down, retired\r\nRussian official was to be found there sometimes in the evening. He was\r\ninfinitely forlorn and wearisome by his mere dismal presence. I think\r\nthese ladies tolerated his frequent visits because of an ancient\r\nfriendship with Mr. Haldin, the father, or something of that sort. I\r\nmade up my mind that if I found him prosing away there in his feeble\r\nvoice I should remain but a very few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe door surprised me by swinging open before I could ring the bell. I\r\nwas confronted by Miss Haldin, in hat and jacket, obviously on the point\r\nof going out. At that hour! For the doctor, perhaps?\r\n\r\nHer exclamation of welcome reassured me. It sounded as if I had been the\r\nvery man she wanted to see. My curiosity was awakened. She drew me in,\r\nand the faithful Anna, the elderly German maid, closed the door, but did\r\nnot go away afterwards. She remained near it as if in readiness to let\r\nme out presently. It appeared that Miss Haldin had been on the point of\r\ngoing out to find me.\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a hurried manner very unusual with her. She would have\r\ngone straight and rung at Mrs. Ziegler\xe2\x80\x99s door, late as it was, for Mrs.\r\nZiegler\xe2\x80\x99s habits....\r\n\r\nMrs. Ziegler, the widow of a distinguished professor who was an intimate\r\nfriend of mine, lets me have three rooms out of her very large and fine\r\napartment, which she didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death; but I\r\nhave my own entrance opening on the same landing. It was an arrangement\r\nof at least ten years\xe2\x80\x99 standing. I said that I was very glad that I had\r\nthe idea to....\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin made no motion to take off her outdoor things. I observed\r\nher heightened colour, something pronouncedly resolute in her tone. Did\r\nI know where Mr. Razumov lived?\r\n\r\nWhere Mr. Razumov lived? Mr. Razumov? At this hour--so urgently? I threw\r\nmy arms up in sign of utter ignorance. I had not the slightest idea\r\nwhere he lived. If I could have foreseen her question only three hours\r\nago, I might have ventured to ask him on the pavement before the new\r\npost office building, and possibly he would have told me, but very\r\npossibly, too, he would have dismissed me rudely to mind my own\r\nbusiness. And possibly, I thought, remembering that extraordinary\r\nhallucined, anguished, and absent expression, he might have fallen down\r\nin a fit from the shock of being spoken to. I said nothing of all this\r\nto Miss Haldin, not even mentioning that I had a glimpse of the young\r\nman so recently. The impression had been so extremely unpleasant that I\r\nwould have been glad to forget it myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see where I could make inquiries,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured helplessly. I\r\nwould have been glad to be of use in any way, and would have set off to\r\nfetch any man, young or old, for I had the greatest confidence in\r\nher common sense. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you think of coming to me for that\r\ninformation?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly for that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice. She had the air\r\nof some one confronted by an unpleasant task.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand that you must communicate with Mr. Razumov this\r\nevening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNatalia Haldin moved her head affirmatively; then, after a glance at the\r\ndoor of the drawing-room, said in French--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est maman_,\xe2\x80\x9d and remained perplexed for a moment. Always serious,\r\nnot a girl to be put out by any imaginary difficulties, my curiosity was\r\nsuspended on her lips, which remained closed for a moment. What was Mr.\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s connexion with this mention of her mother? Mrs. Haldin had not\r\nbeen informed of her son\xe2\x80\x99s friend\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in Geneva.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I hope to see your mother this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin extended her hand as if to bar the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is in a terrible state of agitation. Oh, you would not be able\r\nto detect.... It\xe2\x80\x99s inward, but I who know mother, I am appalled. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t the courage to face it any longer. It\xe2\x80\x99s all my fault; I suppose\r\nI cannot play a part; I\xe2\x80\x99ve never before hidden anything from mother.\r\nThere has never been an occasion for anything of that sort between us.\r\nBut you know yourself the reason why I refrained from telling her at\r\nonce of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s arrival here. You understand, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Owing to\r\nher unhappy state. And--there--I am no actress. My own feelings being\r\nstrongly engaged, I somehow.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She noticed something\r\nin my manner. She thought I was concealing something from her. She\r\nnoticed my longer absences, and, in fact, as I have been meeting Mr.\r\nRazumov daily, I used to stay away longer than usual when I went out.\r\nGoodness knows what suspicions arose in her mind. You know that she has\r\nnot been herself ever since.... So this evening she--who has been so\r\nawfully silent: for weeks-began to talk all at once. She said that she\r\ndid not want to reproach me; that I had my character as she had her own;\r\nthat she did not want to pry into my affairs or even into my thoughts;\r\nfor her part, she had never had anything to conceal from her\r\nchildren...cruel things to listen to. And all this in her quiet voice,\r\nwith that poor, wasted face as calm as a stone. It was unbearable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin talked in an undertone and more rapidly than I had ever\r\nheard her speak before. That in itself was disturbing. The ante-room\r\nbeing strongly lighted, I could see under the veil the heightened colour\r\nof her face. She stood erect, her left hand was resting lightly on a\r\nsmall table. The other hung by her side without stirring. Now and then\r\nshe caught her breath slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was too startling. Just fancy! She thought that I was making\r\npreparations to leave her without saying anything. I knelt by the side\r\nof her chair and entreated her to think of what she was saying! She put\r\nher hand on my head, but she persists in her delusion all the same. She\r\nhad always thought that she was worthy of her children\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, but\r\napparently it was not so. Her son could not trust her love nor yet her\r\nunderstanding--and now I was planning to abandon her in the same cruel\r\nand unjust manner, and so on, and so on. Nothing I could say.... It\r\nis morbid obstinacy.... She said that she felt there was something,\r\nsome change in me.... If my convictions were calling me away, why\r\nthis secrecy, as though she had been a coward or a weakling not safe to\r\ntrust? \xe2\x80\x98As if my heart could play traitor to my children,\xe2\x80\x99 she said....\r\nIt was hardly to be borne. And she was smoothing my head all the\r\ntime.... It was perfectly useless to protest. She is ill. Her very\r\nsoul is....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not venture to break the silence which fell between us. I looked\r\ninto her eyes, glistening through the veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! Changed!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed in the same low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cMy convictions\r\ncalling me away! It was cruel to hear this, because my trouble is that I\r\nam weak and cannot see what I ought to do. You know that. And to end it\r\nall I did a selfish thing. To remove her suspicions of myself I told her\r\nof Mr. Razumov. It was selfish of me. You know we were completely\r\nright in agreeing to keep the knowledge away from her. Perfectly right.\r\nDirectly I told her of our poor Victor\xe2\x80\x99s friend being here I saw how\r\nright we have been. She ought to have been prepared; but in my distress\r\nI just blurted it out. Mother got terribly excited at once. How long\r\nhas he been here? What did he know, and why did he not come to see us at\r\nonce, this friend of her Victor? What did that mean? Was she not to be\r\ntrusted even with such memories as there were left of her son?... Just\r\nthink how I felt seeing her, white like a sheet, perfectly motionless,\r\nwith her thin hands gripping the arms of the chair. I told her it was\r\nall my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could imagine the motionless dumb figure of the mother in her chair,\r\nthere, behind the door, near which the daughter was talking to me.\r\nThe silence in there seemed to call aloud for vengeance against an\r\nhistorical fact and the modern instances of its working. That view\r\nflashed through my mind, but I could not doubt that Miss Haldin had had\r\nan atrocious time of it. I quite understood when she said that she could\r\nnot face the night upon the impression of that scene. Mrs. Haldin\r\nhad given way to most awful imaginings, to most fantastic and cruel\r\nsuspicions. All this had to be lulled at all costs and without loss of\r\ntime. It was no shock to me to learn that Miss Haldin had said to her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go and bring him here at once.\xe2\x80\x9d There was nothing absurd in that\r\ncry, no exaggeration of sentiment. I was not even doubtful in my \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nwell, but how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly right that she should think of me, but what could I do\r\nin my ignorance of Mr. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s quarters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think he may be living near by, within a stone\xe2\x80\x99s-throw,\r\nperhaps!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI doubted it; but I would have gone off cheerfully to fetch him from the\r\nother end of Geneva. I suppose she was certain of my readiness, since\r\nher first thought was to come to me. But the service she meant to ask of\r\nme really was to accompany her to the Chateau Borel.\r\n\r\nI had an unpleasant mental vision of the dark road, of the sombre\r\ngrounds, and the desolately suspicious aspect of that home of necromancy\r\nand intrigue and feminist adoration. I objected that Madame de S-- most\r\nlikely would know nothing of what we wanted to find out. Neither did I\r\nthink it likely that the young man would be found there. I remembered\r\nmy glimpse of his face, and somehow gained the conviction that a man who\r\nlooked worse than if he had seen the dead would want to shut himself up\r\nsomewhere where he could be alone. I felt a strange certitude that Mr.\r\nRazumov was going home when I saw him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is really of Peter Ivanovitch that I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nAh! He, of course, would know. I looked at my watch. It was twenty\r\nminutes past nine only.... Still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would try his hotel, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I advised. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has rooms at the\r\nCosmopolitan, somewhere on the top floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not offer to go by myself, simply from mistrust of the reception I\r\nshould meet with. But I suggested the faithful Anna, with a note asking\r\nfor the information.\r\n\r\nAnna was still waiting by the door at the other end of the room, and we\r\ntwo discussed the matter in whispers. Miss Haldin thought she must go\r\nherself. Anna was timid and slow. Time would be lost in bringing back\r\nthe answer, and from that point of view it was getting late, for it was\r\nby no means certain that Mr. Razumov lived near by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I go myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin argued, \xe2\x80\x9cI can go straight to him from the\r\nhotel. And in any case I should have to go out, because I must explain\r\nto Mr. Razumov personally--prepare him in a way. You have no idea of\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer colour came and went. She even thought that both for her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake and for her own it was better that they should not be together for\r\na little time. Anna, whom her mother liked, would be at hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe could take her sewing into the room,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin continued,\r\nleading the way to the door. Then, addressing in German the maid who\r\nopened it before us, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may tell my mother that this gentleman called\r\nand is gone with me to find Mr. Razumov. She must not be uneasy if I am\r\naway for some length of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe passed out quickly into the street, and she took deep breaths of the\r\ncool night air. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not even ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with a laugh. The manner of my reception\r\nby the great feminist could not be considered now. That he would be\r\nannoyed to see me, and probably treat me to some solemn insolence, I had\r\nno doubt, but I supposed that he would not absolutely dare to throw me\r\nout. And that was all I cared for. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you take my arm?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nShe did so in silence, and neither of us said anything worth recording\r\ntill I let her go first into the great hall of the hotel. It was\r\nbrilliantly lighted, and with a good many people lounging about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could very well go up there without you,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be left waiting in this place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will come too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI led her straight to the lift then. At the top floor the attendant\r\ndirected us to the right: \xe2\x80\x9cEnd of the corridor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe walls were white, the carpet red, electric lights blazed in\r\nprofusion, and the emptiness, the silence, the closed doors all alike\r\nand numbered, made me think of the perfect order of some severely\r\nluxurious model penitentiary on the solitary confinement principle. Up\r\nthere under the roof of that enormous pile for housing travellers\r\nno sound of any kind reached us, the thick crimson felt muffled our\r\nfootsteps completely. We hastened on, not looking at each other till we\r\nfound ourselves before the very last door of that long passage. Then our\r\neyes met, and we stood thus for a moment lending ear to a faint murmur\r\nof voices inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose this is it,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered unnecessarily. I saw Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips move without a sound, and after my sharp knock the murmur of voices\r\ninside ceased. A profound stillness lasted for a few seconds, and then\r\nthe door was brusquely opened by a short, black-eyed woman in a red\r\nblouse, with a great lot of nearly white hair, done up negligently in\r\nan untidy and unpicturesque manner. Her thin, jetty eyebrows were drawn\r\ntogether. I learned afterwards with interest that she was the famous--or\r\nthe notorious--Sophia Antonovna, but I was struck then by the quaint\r\nMephistophelian character of her inquiring glance, because it was so\r\ncuriously evil-less, so--I may say--un-devilish. It got softened still\r\nmore as she looked up at Miss Haldin, who stated, in her rich, even\r\nvoice, her wish to see Peter Ivanovitch for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Miss Haldin,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nAt this, with her brow completely smoothed out now, but without a word\r\nin answer, the woman in the red blouse walked away to a sofa and sat\r\ndown, leaving the door wide open.\r\n\r\nAnd from the sofa, her hands lying on her lap, she watched us enter,\r\nwith her black, glittering eyes.\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin advanced into the middle of the room; I, faithful to my part\r\nof mere attendant, remained by the door after closing it behind me. The\r\nroom, quite a large one, but with a low ceiling, was scantily furnished,\r\nand an electric bulb with a porcelain shade pulled low down over a big\r\ntable (with a very large map spread on it) left its distant parts in a\r\ndim, artificial twilight. Peter Ivanovitch was not to be seen, neither\r\nwas Mr. Razumov present. But, on the sofa, near Sophia Antonovna, a\r\nbony-faced man with a goatee beard leaned forward with his hands on\r\nhis knees, staring hard with a kindly expression. In a remote corner a\r\nbroad, pale face and a bulky shape could be made out, uncouth, and as if\r\ninsecure on the low seat on which it rested. The only person known to me\r\nwas little Julius Laspara, who seemed to have been poring over the map,\r\nhis feet twined tightly round the chair-legs. He got down briskly and\r\nbowed to Miss Haldin, looking absurdly like a hooknosed boy with a\r\nbeautiful false pepper-and-salt beard. He advanced, offering his seat,\r\nwhich Miss Haldin declined. She had only come in for a moment to say a\r\nfew words to Peter Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\nHis high-pitched voice became painfully audible in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrangely enough, I was thinking of you this very afternoon, Natalia\r\nVictorovna. I met Mr. Razumov. I asked him to write me an article on\r\nanything he liked. You could translate it into English--with such a\r\nteacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded complimentarily in my direction. At the name of Razumov an\r\nindescribable sound, a sort of feeble squeak, as of some angry small\r\nanimal, was heard in the corner occupied by the man who seemed much too\r\nlarge for the chair on which he sat. I did not hear what Miss Haldin\r\nsaid. Laspara spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to do something, Natalia Victorovna. But I suppose you have\r\nyour own ideas. Why not write something yourself? Suppose you came to\r\nsee us soon? We could talk it over. Any advice...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain I did not catch Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s words. It was Laspara\xe2\x80\x99s voice once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch? He\xe2\x80\x99s retired for a moment into the other room. We\r\nare all waiting for him.\xe2\x80\x9d The great man, entering at that moment, looked\r\nbigger, taller, quite imposing in a long dressing-gown of some dark\r\nstuff. It descended in straight lines down to his feet. He suggested\r\na monk or a prophet, a robust figure of same desert-dweller--something\r\nAsiatic; and the dark glasses in conjunction with this costume made him\r\nmore mysterious than ever in the subdued light.\r\n\r\nLittle Laspara went back to his chair to look at the map, the only\r\nbrilliantly lit object in the room. Even from my distant position by the\r\ndoor I could make out, by the shape of the blue part representing the\r\nwater, that it was a map of the Baltic provinces. Peter Ivanovitch\r\nexclaimed slightly, advancing towards Miss Haldin, checked himself\r\non perceiving me, very vaguely no doubt; and peered with his dark,\r\nbespectacled stare. He must have recognized me by my grey hair, because,\r\nwith a marked shrug of his broad shoulders, he turned to Miss Haldin in\r\nbenevolent indulgence. He seized her hand in his thick cushioned palm,\r\nand put his other big paw over it like a lid.\r\n\r\nWhile those two standing in the middle of the floor were exchanging a\r\nfew inaudible phrases no one else moved in the room: Laspara, with his\r\nback to us, kneeling on the chair, his elbows propped on the big-scale\r\nmap, the shadowy enormity in the corner, the frankly staring man with\r\nthe goatee on the sofa, the woman in the red blouse by his side--not one\r\nof them stirred. I suppose that really they had no time, for Miss Haldin\r\nwithdrew her hand immediately from Peter Ivanovitch and before I was\r\nready for her was moving to the door. A disregarded Westerner, I threw\r\nit open hurriedly and followed her out, my last glance leaving them all\r\nmotionless in their varied poses: Peter Ivanovitch alone standing up,\r\nwith his dark glasses like an enormous blind teacher, and behind him the\r\nvivid patch of light on the coloured map, pored over by the diminutive\r\nLaspara.\r\n\r\nLater on, much later on, at the time of the newspaper rumours (they were\r\nvague and soon died out) of an abortive military conspiracy in Russia,\r\nI remembered the glimpse I had of that motionless group with its\r\ncentral figure. No details ever came out, but it was known that the\r\nrevolutionary parties abroad had given their assistance, had sent\r\nemissaries in advance, that even money was found to dispatch a steamer\r\nwith a cargo of arms and conspirators to invade the Baltic provinces.\r\nAnd while my eyes scanned the imperfect disclosures (in which the world\r\nwas not much interested) I thought that the old, settled Europe had been\r\ngiven in my person attending that Russian girl something like a glimpse\r\nbehind the scenes. A short, strange glimpse on the top floor of a great\r\nhotel of all places in the world: the great man himself; the motionless\r\ngreat bulk in the corner of the slayer of spies and gendarmes;\r\nYakovlitch, the veteran of ancient terrorist campaigns; the woman, with\r\nher hair as white as mine and the lively black eyes, all in a mysterious\r\nhalf-light, with the strongly lighted map of Russia on the table. The\r\nwoman I had the opportunity to see again. As we were waiting for the\r\nlift she came hurrying along the corridor, with her eyes fastened\r\non Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s face, and drew her aside as if for a confidential\r\ncommunication. It was not long. A few words only.\r\n\r\nGoing down in the lift, Natalia Haldin did not break the silence. It was\r\nonly when out of the hotel and as we moved along the quay in the fresh\r\ndarkness spangled by the quay lights, reflected in the black water of\r\nthe little port on our left hand, and with lofty piles of hotels on our\r\nright, that she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was Sophia Antonovna--you know the woman?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know--the famous...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same. It appears that after we went out Peter Ivanovitch told them\r\nwhy I had come. That was the reason she ran out after us. She named\r\nherself to me, and then she said, \xe2\x80\x98You are the sister of a brave man who\r\nshall be remembered. You may see better times.\xe2\x80\x99 I told her I hoped to\r\nsee the time when all this would be forgotten, even if the name of my\r\nbrother were to be forgotten too. Something moved me to say that, but\r\nyou understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think of the era of concord and justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. There is too much hate and revenge in that work. It must be done.\r\nIt is a sacrifice--and so let it be all the greater. Destruction is the\r\nwork of anger. Let the tyrants and the slayers be forgotten together,\r\nand only the reconstructors be remembered.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did Sophia Antonovna agree with you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked sceptically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not say anything except, \xe2\x80\x98It is good for you to believe in\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x99 I should think she understood me. Then she asked me if I hoped to\r\nsee Mr. Razumov presently. I said I trusted I could manage to bring him\r\nto see my mother this evening, as my mother had learned of his being\r\nhere and was morbidly impatient to learn if he could tell us something\r\nof Victor. He was the only friend of my brother we knew of, and a great\r\nintimate. She said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! Your brother--yes. Please tell Mr. Razumov that\r\nI have made public the story which came to me from St. Petersburg. It\r\nconcerns your brother\xe2\x80\x99s arrest,\xe2\x80\x99 she added. \xe2\x80\x98He was betrayed by a man of\r\nthe people who has since hanged himself. Mr. Razumov will explain it all\r\nto you. I gave him the full information this afternoon. And please tell\r\nMr. Razumov that Sophia Antonovna sends him her greetings. I am going\r\naway early in the morning--far away.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Haldin added, after a moment of silence--\xe2\x80\x9cI was so moved\r\nby what I heard so unexpectedly that I simply could not speak to you\r\nbefore.... A man of the people! Oh, our poor people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly, as if tired out suddenly. Her head drooped; from the\r\nwindows of a building with terraces and balconies came the banal sound\r\nof hotel music; before the low mean portals of the Casino two red\r\nposters blazed under the electric lamps, with a cheap provincial\r\neffect.--and the emptiness of the quays, the desert aspect of the\r\nstreets, had an air of hypocritical respectability and of inexpressible\r\ndreariness.\r\n\r\nI had taken for granted she had obtained the address, and let myself be\r\nguided by her. On the Mont Blanc bridge, where a few dark figures seemed\r\nlost in the wide and long perspective defined by the lights, she said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t very far from our house. I somehow thought it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.\r\nThe address is Rue de Carouge. I think it must be one of those big new\r\nhouses for artisans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took my arm confidingly, familiarly, and accelerated her pace. There\r\nwas something primitive in our proceedings. We did not think of\r\nthe resources of civilization. A late tramcar overtook us; a row of\r\n_fiacres_ stood by the railing of the gardens. It never entered our\r\nheads to make use of these conveyances. She was too hurried, perhaps,\r\nand as to myself--well, she had taken my arm confidingly. As we were\r\nascending the easy incline of the Corraterie, all the shops shuttered\r\nand no light in any of the windows (as if all the mercenary population\r\nhad fled at the end of the day), she said tentatively--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could run in for a moment to have a look at mother. It would not be\r\nmuch out of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dissuaded her. If Mrs. Haldin really expected to see Razumov that\r\nnight it would have been unwise to show herself without him. The sooner\r\nwe got hold of the young man and brought him along to calm her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nagitation the better. She assented to my reasoning, and we crossed\r\ndiagonally the Place de Theatre, bluish grey with its floor of slabs of\r\nstone, under the electric light, and the lonely equestrian statue\r\nall black in the middle. In the Rue de Carouge we were in the poorer\r\nquarters and approaching the outskirts of the town. Vacant building\r\nplots alternated with high, new houses. At the corner of a side street\r\nthe crude light of a whitewashed shop fell into the night, fan-like,\r\nthrough a wide doorway. One could see from a distance the inner wall\r\nwith its scantily furnished shelves, and the deal counter painted brown.\r\nThat was the house. Approaching it along the dark stretch of a fence\r\nof tarred planks, we saw the narrow pallid face of the cut angle, five\r\nsingle windows high, without a gleam in them, and crowned by the heavy\r\nshadow of a jutting roof slope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must inquire in the shop,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin directed me.\r\n\r\nA sallow, thinly whiskered man, wearing a dingy white collar and a\r\nfrayed tie, laid down a newspaper, and, leaning familiarly on both\r\nelbows far over the bare counter, answered that the person I was\r\ninquiring for was indeed his _locataire_ on the third floor, but that\r\nfor the moment he was out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, after a glance at Miss Haldin. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes this\r\nmean that you expect him back at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very gentle, with ingratiating eyes and soft lips. He smiled\r\nfaintly as though he knew all about everything. Mr. Razumov, after being\r\nabsent all day, had returned early in the evening. He was very surprised\r\nabout half an hour or a little more since to see him come down again.\r\nMr. Razumov left his key, and in the course of some words which passed\r\nbetween them had remarked that he was going out because he needed air.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the bare counter he went on smiling at us, his head held\r\nbetween his hands. Air. Air. But whether that meant a long or a short\r\nabsence it was difficult to say. The night was very close, certainly.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, his ingratiating eyes turned to the door, he added--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe storm shall drive him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a storm?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if to confirm his words we heard a very distant, deep rumbling noise.\r\n\r\nConsulting Miss Haldin by a glance, I saw her so reluctant to give up\r\nher quest that I asked the shopkeeper, in case Mr. Razumov came home\r\nwithin half an hour, to beg him to remain downstairs in the shop. We\r\nwould look in again presently.\r\n\r\nFor all answer he moved his head imperceptibly. The approval of Miss\r\nHaldin was expressed by her silence. We walked slowly down the street,\r\naway from the town; the low garden walls of the modest villas doomed to\r\ndemolition were overhung by the boughs of trees and masses of foliage,\r\nlighted from below by gas lamps. The violent and monotonous noise of the\r\nicy waters of the Arve falling over a low dam swept towards us with a\r\nchilly draught of air across a great open space, where a double line of\r\nlamp-lights outlined a street as yet without houses. But on the other\r\nshore, overhung by the awful blackness of the thunder-cloud, a solitary\r\ndim light seemed to watch us with a weary stare. When we had strolled as\r\nfar as the bridge, I said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better get back....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the shop the sickly man was studying his smudgy newspaper, now spread\r\nout largely on the counter. He just raised his head when I looked in and\r\nshook it negatively, pursing up his lips. I rejoined Miss Haldin outside\r\nat once, and we moved off at a brisk pace. She remarked that she would\r\nsend Anna with a note the first thing in the morning. I respected her\r\ntaciturnity, silence being perhaps the best way to show my concern.\r\n\r\nThe semi-rural street we followed on our return changed gradually to the\r\nusual town thoroughfare, broad and deserted. We did not meet four people\r\naltogether, and the way seemed interminable, because my companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnatural anxiety had communicated itself sympathetically to me. At last\r\nwe turned into the Boulevard des Philosophes, more wide, more empty,\r\nmore dead--the very desolation of slumbering respectability. At the\r\nsight of the two lighted windows, very conspicuous from afar, I had\r\nthe mental vision of Mrs. Haldin in her armchair keeping a dreadful,\r\ntormenting vigil under the evil spell of an arbitrary rule: a victim of\r\ntyranny and revolution, a sight at once cruel and absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will come in for a moment?\xe2\x80\x9d said Natalia Haldin.\r\n\r\nI demurred on account of the late hour. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know mother likes you so\r\nmuch,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will just come in to hear how your mother is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said, as if to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know whether she will believe\r\nthat I could not find Mr. Razumov, since she has taken it into her head\r\nthat I am concealing something from her. You may be able to persuade\r\nher....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother may mistrust me too,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! Why? What could you have to conceal from her? You are not a\r\nRussian nor a conspirator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt profoundly my European remoteness, and said nothing, but I made\r\nup my mind to play my part of helpless spectator to the end. The distant\r\nrolling of thunder in the valley of the Rhone was coming nearer to the\r\nsleeping town of prosaic virtues and universal hospitality. We crossed\r\nthe street opposite the great dark gateway, and Miss Haldin rang at the\r\ndoor of the apartment. It was opened almost instantly, as if the\r\nelderly maid had been waiting in the ante-room for our return. Her flat\r\nphysiognomy had an air of satisfaction. The gentleman was there, she\r\ndeclared, while closing the door.\r\n\r\nNeither of us understood. Miss Haldin turned round brusquely to her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Razumov,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained.\r\n\r\nShe had heard enough of our conversation before we left to know why her\r\nyoung mistress was going out. Therefore, when the gentleman gave his\r\nname at the door, she admitted him at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one could have foreseen that,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin murmured, with her\r\nserious grey eyes fixed upon mine. And, remembering the expression of\r\nthe young man\xe2\x80\x99s face seen not much more than four hours ago, the look of\r\na haunted somnambulist, I wondered with a sort of awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou asked my mother first?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin inquired of the maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I announced the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, surprised at our troubled\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d I said in an undertone, \xe2\x80\x9cyour mother was prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But he has no idea....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me she doubted his tact. To her question how long the\r\ngentleman had been with her mother, the maid told us that Der Herr had\r\nbeen in the drawing-room no more than a short quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment, then withdrew, looking a little scared. Miss Haldin\r\ngazed at me in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs things have turned out,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou happen to know exactly what\r\nyour brother\xe2\x80\x99s friend has to tell your mother. And surely after that...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Natalia Haldin slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI only wonder, as I was not here\r\nwhen he came, if it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better not to interrupt now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe remained silent, and I suppose we both strained our ears, but no\r\nsound reached us through the closed door. The features of Miss Haldin\r\nexpressed a painful irresolution; she made a movement as if to go in,\r\nbut checked herself. She had heard footsteps on the other side of the\r\ndoor. It came open, and Razumov, without pausing, stepped out into the\r\nante-room. The fatigue of that day and the struggle with himself had\r\nchanged him so much that I would have hesitated to recognize that face\r\nwhich, only a few hours before, when he brushed against me in front of\r\nthe post office, had been startling enough but quite different. It\r\nhad been not so livid then, and its eyes not so sombre. They certainly\r\nlooked more sane now, but there was upon them the shadow of something\r\nconsciously evil.\r\n\r\nI speak of that, because, at first, their glance fell on me, though\r\nwithout any sort of recognition or even comprehension. I was simply in\r\nthe line of his stare. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he had heard the bell or expected\r\nto see anybody. He was going out, I believe, and I do not think that\r\nhe saw Miss Haldin till she advanced towards him a step or two. He\r\ndisregarded the hand she put out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you, Natalia Victorovna.... Perhaps you are surprised...at\r\nthis late hour. But, you see, I remembered our conversations in that\r\ngarden. I thought really it was your wish that I should--without loss of\r\ntime...so I came. No other reason. Simply to tell...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with difficulty. I noticed that, and remembered his declaration\r\nto the man in the shop that he was going out because he \xe2\x80\x9cneeded air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n If that was his object, then it was clear that he had miserably failed.\r\nWith downcast eyes and lowered head he made an effort to pick up the\r\nstrangled phrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell what I have heard myself only to-day--to-day....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the door he had not closed I had a view of the drawing-room. It\r\nwas lighted only by a shaded lamp--Mrs. Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes could not support\r\neither gas or electricity. It was a comparatively big room, and in\r\ncontrast with the strongly lighted ante-room its length was lost in\r\nsemi-transparent gloom backed by heavy shadows; and on that ground I saw\r\nthe motionless figure of Mrs. Haldin, inclined slightly forward, with a\r\npale hand resting on the arm of the chair.\r\n\r\nShe did not move. With the window before her she had no longer that\r\nattitude suggesting expectation. The blind was down; and outside\r\nthere was only the night sky harbouring a thunder-cloud, and the town\r\nindifferent and hospitable in its cold, almost scornful, toleration--a\r\nrespectable town of refuge to which all these sorrows and hopes were\r\nnothing. Her white head was bowed.\r\n\r\nThe thought that the real drama of autocracy is not played on the great\r\nstage of politics came to me as, fated to be a spectator, I had this\r\nother glimpse behind the scenes, something more profound than the words\r\nand gestures of the public play. I had the certitude that this mother,\r\nrefused in her heart to give her son up after all. It was more\r\nthan Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s inconsolable mourning, it was something deeper, more\r\ninaccessible in its frightful tranquillity. Lost in the ill-defined\r\nmass of the high-backed chair, her white, inclined profile suggested\r\nthe contemplation of something in her lap, as though a beloved head were\r\nresting there.\r\n\r\nI had this glimpse behind the scenes, and then Miss Haldin, passing by\r\nthe young man, shut the door. It was not done without hesitation. For a\r\nmoment I thought that she would go to her mother, but she sent in only\r\nan anxious glance. Perhaps if Mrs. Haldin had moved...but no. There\r\nwas in the immobility of that bloodless face the dreadful aloofness of\r\nsuffering without remedy.\r\n\r\nMeantime the young man kept his eyes fixed on the floor. The thought\r\nthat he would have to repeat the story he had told already was\r\nintolerable to him. He had expected to find the two women together. And\r\nthen, he had said to himself, it would be over for all time--for all\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in another world,\xe2\x80\x9d he had thought\r\ncynically.\r\n\r\nAlone in his room after having posted his secret letter, he had regained\r\na certain measure of composure by writing in his secret diary. He was\r\naware of the danger of that strange self-indulgence. He alludes to it\r\nhimself, but he could not refrain. It calmed him--it reconciled him\r\nto his existence. He sat there scribbling by the light of a solitary\r\ncandle, till it occurred to him that having heard the explanation of\r\nHaldin\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, as put forward by Sophia Antonovna, it behoved him to\r\ntell these ladies himself. They were certain to hear the tale through\r\nsome other channel, and then his abstention would look strange, not only\r\nto the mother and sister of Haldin, but to other people also. Having\r\ncome to this conclusion, he did not discover in himself any marked\r\nreluctance to face the necessity, and very soon an anxiety to be done\r\nwith it began to torment him. He looked at his watch. No; it was not\r\nabsolutely too late.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen minutes with Mrs. Haldin were like the revenge of the\r\nunknown: that white face, that weak, distinct voice; that head, at\r\nfirst turned to him eagerly, then, after a while, bowed again and\r\nmotionless--in the dim, still light of the room in which his words\r\nwhich he tried to subdue resounded so loudly--had troubled him like some\r\nstrange discovery. And there seemed to be a secret obstinacy in that\r\nsorrow, something he could not understand; at any rate, something he had\r\nnot expected. Was it hostile? But it did not matter. Nothing could touch\r\nhim now; in the eyes of the revolutionists there was now no shadow on\r\nhis past. The phantom of Haldin had been indeed walked over, was left\r\nbehind lying powerless and passive on the pavement covered with snow.\r\nAnd this was the phantom\xe2\x80\x99s mother consumed with grief and white as a\r\nghost. He had felt a pitying surprise. But that, of course, was of no\r\nimportance. Mothers did not matter. He could not shake off the poignant\r\nimpression of that silent, quiet, white-haired woman, but a sort of\r\nsternness crept into his thoughts. These were the consequences. Well,\r\nwhat of it? \xe2\x80\x9cAm I then on a bed of roses?\xe2\x80\x9d he had exclaimed to himself,\r\nsitting at some distance with his eyes fixed upon that figure of sorrow.\r\nHe had said all he had to say to her, and when he had finished she had\r\nnot uttered a word. She had turned away her head while he was speaking.\r\nThe silence which had fallen on his last words had lasted for five\r\nminutes or more. What did it mean? Before its incomprehensible character\r\nhe became conscious of anger in his stern mood, the old anger against\r\nHaldin reawakened by the contemplation of Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s mother. And was\r\nit not something like enviousness which gripped his heart, as if of\r\na privilege denied to him alone of all the men that had ever passed\r\nthrough this world? It was the other who had attained to repose and yet\r\ncontinued to exist in the affection of that mourning old woman, in\r\nthe thoughts of all these people posing for lovers of humanity. It\r\nwas impossible to get rid of him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s myself whom I have given up\r\nto destruction,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumov. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has induced me to do it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshake him off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlarmed by that discovery, he got up and strode out of the silent,\r\ndim room with its silent old woman in the chair, that mother! He never\r\nlooked back. It was frankly a flight. But on opening the door he saw\r\nhis retreat cut off: There was the sister. He had never forgotten the\r\nsister, only he had not expected to see her then--or ever any more,\r\nperhaps. Her presence in the ante-room was as unforeseen as the\r\napparition of her brother had been. Razumov gave a start as though he\r\nhad discovered himself cleverly trapped. He tried to smile, but could\r\nnot manage it, and lowered his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cMust I repeat that silly story\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, and felt a sinking sensation. Nothing solid\r\nhad passed his lips since the day before, but he was not in a state to\r\nanalyse the origins of his weakness. He meant to take up his hat and\r\ndepart with as few words as possible, but Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s swift movement\r\nto shut the door took him by surprise. He half turned after her, but\r\nwithout raising his eyes, passively, just as a feather might stir in the\r\ndisturbed air. The next moment she was back in the place she had started\r\nfrom, with another half-turn on his part, so that they came again into\r\nthe same relative positions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very grateful to you, Kirylo\r\nSidorovitch, for coming at once--like this.... Only, I wish I had....\r\nDid mother tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what she could have told me that I did not know before,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, obviously to himself, but perfectly audible. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I always did\r\nknow it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added louder, as if in despair.\r\n\r\nHe hung his head. He had such a strong sense of Natalia Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence that to look at her he felt would be a relief. It was she who\r\nhad been haunting him now. He had suffered that persecution ever since\r\nshe had suddenly appeared before him in the garden of the Villa Borel\r\nwith an extended hand and the name of her brother on her lips....\r\nThe ante-room had a row of hooks on the wall nearest to the outer door,\r\nwhile against the wall opposite there stood a small dark table and one\r\nchair. The paper, bearing a very faint design, was all but white. The\r\nlight of an electric bulb high up under the ceiling searched that clear\r\nsquare box into its four bare corners, crudely, without shadows--a\r\nstrange stage for an obscure drama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Haldin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that you knew\r\nalways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his face, pale, full of unexpressed suffering. But that\r\nlook in his eyes of dull, absent obstinacy, which struck and surprised\r\neverybody he was talking to, began to pass away. It was as though he\r\nwere coming to himself in the awakened consciousness of that marvellous\r\nharmony of feature, of lines, of glances, of voice, which made of the\r\ngirl before him a being so rare, outside, and, as it were, above the\r\ncommon notion of beauty. He looked at her so long that she coloured\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that you knew?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated vaguely.\r\n\r\nThat time he managed to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, if it had not been for a word of greeting or two, I would doubt\r\nwhether your mother was aware at all of my existence. You understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNatalia Haldin nodded; her hands moved slightly by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Is it not heart-breaking? She has not shed a tear yet--not a\r\nsingle tear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a tear! And you, Natalia Victorovna? You have been able to cry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have. And then I am young enough, Kirylo Sidorovitch, to believe in\r\nthe future. But when I see my mother so terribly distracted, I almost\r\nforget everything. I ask myself whether one should feel proud--or only\r\nresigned. We had such a lot of people coming to see us. There were\r\nutter strangers who wrote asking for permission to call to present their\r\nrespects. It was impossible to keep our door shut for ever. You know\r\nthat Peter Ivanovitch himself.... Oh yes, there was much sympathy,\r\nbut there were persons who exulted openly at that death. Then, when I\r\nwas left alone with poor mother, all this seemed so wrong in spirit,\r\nsomething not worth the price she is paying for it. But directly I heard\r\nyou were here in Geneva, Kirylo Sidorovitch, I felt that you were the\r\nonly person who could assist me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn comforting a bereaved mother? Yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke in in a manner which\r\nmade her open her clear unsuspecting eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is a question of\r\nfitness. Has this occurred to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a breathlessness in his utterance which contrasted with the\r\nmonstrous hint of mockery in his intention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Natalia Haldin with feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cWho more fit than you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a convulsive movement of exasperation, but controlled himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! Directly you heard that I was in Geneva, before even seeing me?\r\nIt is another proof of that confidence which....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll at once his tone changed, became more incisive and more detached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen are poor creatures, Natalia Victorovna. They have no intuition of\r\nsentiment. In order to speak fittingly to a mother of her lost son one\r\nmust have had some experience of the filial relation. It is not the case\r\nwith me--if you must know the whole truth. Your hopes have to deal here\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x98a breast unwarmed by any affection,\xe2\x80\x99 as the poet says.... That\r\ndoes not mean it is insensible,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a lower tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain your heart is not unfeeling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Haldin softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It is not as hard as a stone,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in the same introspective\r\nvoice, and looking as if his heart were lying as heavy as a stone in\r\nthat unwarmed breast of which he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not so hard. But how to\r\nprove what you give me credit for--ah! that\xe2\x80\x99s another question. No one\r\nhas ever expected such a thing from me before. No one whom my tenderness\r\nwould have been of any use to. And now you come. You! Now! No, Natalia\r\nVictorovna. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late. You come too late. You must expect nothing\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe recoiled from him a little, though he had made no movement, as\r\nif she had seen some change in his face, charging his words with the\r\nsignificance of some hidden sentiment they shared together. To me, the\r\nsilent spectator, they looked like two people becoming conscious of a\r\nspell which had been lying on them ever since they first set eyes on\r\neach other. Had either of them cast a glance then in my direction, I\r\nwould have opened the door quietly and gone out. But neither did; and\r\nI remained, every fear of indiscretion lost in the sense of my enormous\r\nremoteness from their captivity within the sombre horizon of Russian\r\nproblems, the boundary of their eyes, of their feelings--the prison of\r\ntheir souls.\r\n\r\nFrank, courageous, Miss Haldin controlled her voice in the midst of her\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as if speaking to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may mean that you have given yourself up to vain imaginings while I\r\nhave managed to remain amongst the truth of things and the realities of\r\nlife--our Russian life--such as they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ugly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that--and ugly. Look where you like. Look near\r\nyou, here abroad where you are, and then look back at home, whence you\r\ncame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must look beyond the present.\xe2\x80\x9d Her tone had an ardent conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blind can do that best. I have had the misfortune to be born\r\nclear-eyed. And if you only knew what strange things I have seen! What\r\namazing and unexpected apparitions!... But why talk of all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I want to talk of all this with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested\r\nwith earnest serenity. The sombre humours of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s friend left\r\nher unaffected, as though that bitterness, that suppressed anger, were\r\nthe signs of an indignant rectitude. She saw that he was not an ordinary\r\nperson, and perhaps she did not want him to be other than he appeared to\r\nher trustful eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, with you especially,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cWith you\r\nof all the Russian people in the world....\xe2\x80\x9d A faint smile dwelt for\r\na moment on her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI am like poor mother in a way. I too seem unable\r\nto give up our beloved dead, who, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, was all in all to us. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to abuse your sympathy, but you must understand that it is in\r\nyou that we can find all that is left of his generous soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was looking at him; not a muscle of his face moved in the least. And\r\nyet, even at the time, I did not suspect him of insensibility. It was a\r\nsort of rapt thoughtfulness. Then he stirred slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going, Kirylo Sidorovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! Going? Where? Oh yes, but I must tell you first....\xe2\x80\x9d His voice\r\nwas muffled and he forced himself to produce it with visible repugnance,\r\nas if speech were something disgusting or deadly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat story, you\r\nknow--the story I heard this afternoon....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the story already,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it! Have you correspondents in St. Petersburg too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It\xe2\x80\x99s Sophia Antonovna. I have seen her just now. She sends you her\r\ngreetings. She is going away to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had lowered at last his fascinated glance; she too was looking down,\r\nand standing thus before each other in the glaring light, between the\r\nfour bare walls, they seemed brought out from the confused immensity\r\nof the Eastern borders to be exposed cruelly to the observation of my\r\nWestern eyes. And I observed them. There was nothing else to do. My\r\nexistence seemed so utterly forgotten by these two that I dared not now\r\nmake a movement. And I thought to myself that, of course, they had to\r\ncome together, the sister and the friend of that dead man. The ideas,\r\nthe hopes, the aspirations, the cause of Freedom, expressed in their\r\ncommon affection for Victor Haldin, the moral victim of autocracy,--all\r\nthis must draw them to each other fatally. Her very ignorance and his\r\nloneliness to which he had alluded so strangely must work to that end.\r\nAnd, indeed, I saw that the work was done already. Of course. It was\r\nmanifest that they must have been thinking of each other for a long time\r\nbefore they met. She had the letter from that beloved brother kindling\r\nher imagination by the severe praise attached to that one name; and for\r\nhim to see that exceptional girl was enough. The only cause for surprise\r\nwas his gloomy aloofness before her clearly expressed welcome. But he\r\nwas young, and however austere and devoted to his revolutionary ideals,\r\nhe was not blind. The period of reserve was over; he was coming forward\r\nin his own way. I could not mistake the significance of this late visit,\r\nfor in what he had to say there was nothing urgent. The true cause\r\ndawned upon me: he had discovered that he needed her and she was moved\r\nby the same feeling. It was the second time that I saw them together,\r\nand I knew that next time they met I would not be there, either\r\nremembered or forgotten. I would have virtually ceased to exist for both\r\nthese young people.\r\n\r\nI made this discovery in a very few moments. Meantime, Natalia Haldin\r\nwas telling Razumov briefly of our peregrinations from one end of Geneva\r\nto the other. While speaking she raised her hands above her head to\r\nuntie her veil, and that movement displayed for an instant the seductive\r\ngrace of her youthful figure, clad in the simplest of mourning. In the\r\ntransparent shadow the hat rim threw on her face her grey eyes had an\r\nenticing lustre. Her voice, with its unfeminine yet exquisite timbre,\r\nwas steady, and she spoke quickly, frank, unembarrassed. As she\r\njustified her action by the mental state of her mother, a spasm of pain\r\nmarred the generously confiding harmony of her features. I perceived\r\nthat with his downcast eyes he had the air of a man who is listening\r\nto a strain of music rather than to articulated speech. And in the same\r\nway, after she had ceased, he seemed to listen yet, motionless, as if\r\nunder the spell of suggestive sound. He came to himself, muttering--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. She has not shed a tear. She did not seem to hear what I\r\nwas saying. I might have told her anything. She looked as if no longer\r\nbelonging to this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin gave signs of profound distress. Her voice faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how bad it has come to be. She expects now to see _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nveil dropped from her fingers and she clasped her hands in anguish. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nshall end by her seeing him,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nRazumov raised his head sharply and attached on her a prolonged\r\nthoughtful glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m. That\xe2\x80\x99s very possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered in a peculiar tone, as if\r\ngiving his opinion on a matter of fact. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what....\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nchecked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be the end. Her mind shall be gone then, and her spirit will\r\nfollow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin unclasped her hands and let them fall by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried profoundly. Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s lips were slightly\r\nparted. Something unexpected and unfathomable in that young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter had fascinated her from the first. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! There\xe2\x80\x99s neither truth\r\nnor consolation to be got from the phantoms of the dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after\r\na weighty pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI might have told her something true; for instance,\r\nthat your brother meant to save his life--to escape. There can be no\r\ndoubt of that. But I did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not! But why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Other thoughts came into my head,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. He seemed\r\nto me to be watching himself inwardly, as though he were trying to count\r\nhis own heart-beats, while his eyes never for a moment left the face\r\nof the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were not there,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI had made up my mind\r\nnever to see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed to take her breath away for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou.... How is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may well ask.... However, I think that I refrained from telling\r\nyour mother from prudence. I might have assured her that in the last\r\nconversation he held as a free man he mentioned you both....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat last conversation was with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she struck in her deep, moving\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cSome day you must....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was with me. Of you he said that you had trustful eyes. And why I\r\nhave not been able to forget that phrase I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It meant\r\nthat there is in you no guile, no deception, no falsehood, no\r\nsuspicion--nothing in your heart that could give you a conception of a\r\nliving, acting, speaking lie, if ever it came in your way. That you are\r\na predestined victim.... Ha! what a devilish suggestion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe convulsive, uncontrolled tone of the last words disclosed the\r\nprecarious hold he had over himself. He was like a man defying his own\r\ndizziness in high places and tottering suddenly on the very edge of the\r\nprecipice. Miss Haldin pressed her hand to her breast. The dropped black\r\nveil lay on the floor between them. Her movement steadied him. He looked\r\nintently on that hand till it descended slowly, and then raised again\r\nhis eyes to her face. But he did not give her time to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand? Very well.\xe2\x80\x9d He had recovered his calm by a\r\nmiracle of will. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you talked with Sophia Antonovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Sophia Antonovna told me....\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin stopped, wonder\r\ngrowing in her wide eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m. That\xe2\x80\x99s the respectable enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, as though he were\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tone of her references to you was extremely friendly,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nMiss Haldin, after waiting for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your impression? And she the most intelligent of the lot,\r\ntoo. Things then are going as well as possible. Everything conspires\r\nto...Ah! these conspirators,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, with an accent of scorn;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey would get hold of you in no time! You know, Natalia Victorovna, I\r\nhave the greatest difficulty in saving myself from the superstition\r\nof an active Providence. It\xe2\x80\x99s irresistible.... The alternative, of\r\ncourse, would be the personal Devil of our simple ancestors. But, if\r\nso, he has overdone it altogether--the old Father of Lies--our national\r\npatron--our domestic god, whom we take with us when we go abroad. He has\r\noverdone it. It seems that I am not simple enough.... That\xe2\x80\x99s it! I\r\nought to have known.... And I did know it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a tone of\r\npoignant distress which overcame my astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man is deranged,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, very much frightened.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he gave me a very special impression beyond the range of\r\ncommonplace definitions. It was as though he had stabbed himself outside\r\nand had come in there to show it; and more than that--as though he were\r\nturning the knife in the wound and watching the effect. That was the\r\nimpression, rendered in physical terms. One could not defend oneself\r\nfrom a certain amount of pity. But it was for Miss Haldin, already so\r\ntried in her deepest affections, that I felt a serious concern. Her\r\nattitude, her face, expressed compassion struggling with doubt on the\r\nverge of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Kirylo Sidorovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d There was a hint of tenderness in\r\nthat cry. He only stared at her in that complete surrender of all his\r\nfaculties which in a happy lover would have had the name of ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you looking at me like this, Kirylo Sidorovitch? I have\r\napproached you frankly. I need at this time to see clearly in\r\nmyself....\xe2\x80\x9d She ceased for a moment as if to give him an opportunity to\r\nutter at last some word worthy of her exalted trust in her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend. His silence became impressive, like a sign of a momentous\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nIn the end Miss Haldin went on, appealingly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have waited for you anxiously. But now that you have been moved to\r\ncome to us in your kindness, you alarm me. You speak obscurely. It seems\r\nas if you were keeping back something from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Natalia Victorovna,\xe2\x80\x9d he was heard at last in a strange\r\nunringing voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom did you see in that place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was startled, and as if deceived in her expectations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? In Peter Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s rooms? There was Mr. Laspara and three\r\nother people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! The vanguard--the forlorn hope of the great plot,\xe2\x80\x9d he commented to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cBearers of the spark to start an explosion which is meant to\r\nchange fundamentally the lives of so many millions in order that Peter\r\nIvanovitch should be the head of a State.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are teasing me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur dear one told me once to remember\r\nthat men serve always something greater than themselves--the idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur dear one,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated slowly. The effort he made to appear unmoved\r\nabsorbed all the force of his soul. He stood before her like a being\r\nwith hardly a breath of life. His eyes, even as under great physical\r\nsuffering, had lost all their fire. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! your brother.... But on\r\nyour lips, in your voice, it sounds...and indeed in you everything is\r\ndivine.... I wish I could know the innermost depths of your thoughts,\r\nof your feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Kirylo Sidorovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, alarmed by these words coming\r\nout of strangely lifeless lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave no fear. It is not to betray you. So you went there?... And\r\nSophia Antonovna, what did she tell you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said very little, really. She knew that I should hear everything\r\nfrom you. She had no time for more than a few words.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice dropped and she became silent for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man, it appears,\r\nhas taken his life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Natalia Victorovna,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you believe\r\nin remorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can _you_ know of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered thickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for such as\r\nyou.... What I meant to ask was whether you believed in the efficacy\r\nof remorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated as though she had not understood, then her face lighted\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he is absolved. Moreover, that Ziemianitch was a brute, a drunken\r\nbrute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shudder passed through Natalia Haldin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a man of the people,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto whom they, the\r\nrevolutionists, tell a tale of sublime hopes. Well, the people must\r\nbe forgiven.... And you must not believe all you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from that\r\nsource, either,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a sort of sinister reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are concealing something from me,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Natalia Victorovna, believe in the duty of revenge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Kirylo Sidorovitch. I believe that the future shall be merciful\r\nto us all. Revolutionist and reactionary, victim and executioner,\r\nbetrayer and betrayed, they shall all be pitied together when the light\r\nbreaks on our black sky at last. Pitied and forgotten; for without that\r\nthere can be no union and no love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear. No revenge for you, then? Never? Not the least bit?\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled\r\nbitterly with his colourless lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYou yourself are like the very\r\nspirit of that merciful future. Strange that it does not make it\r\neasier.... No! But suppose that the real betrayer of your\r\nbrother--Ziemianitch had a part in it too, but insignificant and quite\r\ninvoluntary--suppose that he was a young man, educated, an intellectual\r\nworker, thoughtful, a man your brother might have trusted lightly,\r\nperhaps, but still--suppose.... But there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole story there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know the story! But why, then--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard it. There is a staircase in it, and even phantoms, but\r\nthat does not matter if a man always serves something greater than\r\nhimself--the idea. I wonder who is the greatest victim in that tale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that tale!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Haldin repeated. She seemed turned into stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why I came to you? It is simply because there is no one\r\nanywhere in the whole great world I could go to. Do you understand\r\nwhat I say? Not one to go to. Do you conceive the desolation of the\r\nthought--no one--to--go--to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUtterly misled by her own enthusiastic interpretation of two lines in\r\nthe letter of a visionary, under the spell of her own dread of lonely\r\ndays, in their overshadowed world of angry strife, she was unable to\r\nsee the truth struggling on his lips. What she was conscious of was the\r\nobscure form of his suffering. She was on the point of extending her\r\nhand to him impulsively when he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour after I saw you first I knew how it would be. The terrors of\r\nremorse, revenge, confession, anger, hate, fear, are like nothing to the\r\natrocious temptation which you put in my way the day you appeared before\r\nme with your voice, with your face, in the garden of that accursed\r\nvilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked utterly bewildered for a moment; then, with a sort of\r\ndespairing insight went straight to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story, Kirylo Sidorovitch, the story!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no more to tell!\xe2\x80\x9d He made a movement forward, and she actually\r\nput her hand on his shoulder to push him away; but her strength failed\r\nher, and he kept his ground, though trembling in every limb. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ends\r\nhere--on this very spot.\xe2\x80\x9d He pressed a denunciatory finger to his breast\r\nwith force, and became perfectly still.\r\n\r\nI ran forward, snatching up the chair, and was in time to catch hold of\r\nMiss Haldin and lower her down. As she sank into it she swung half round\r\non my arm, and remained averted from us both, drooping over the back.\r\nHe looked at her with an appalling expressionless tranquillity.\r\nIncredulity, struggling with astonishment, anger, and disgust, deprived\r\nme for a time of the power of speech. Then I turned on him, whispering\r\nfrom very rage--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is monstrous. What are you staying for? Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her catch sight\r\nof you again. Go away!...\xe2\x80\x9d He did not budge. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you understand\r\nthat your presence is intolerable--even to me? If there\xe2\x80\x99s any sense of\r\nshame in you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly his sullen eyes moved in my direction. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did this old man\r\ncome here?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, astounded.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Miss Haldin sprang up from the chair, made a few steps, and\r\ntottered. Forgetting my indignation, and even the man himself, I hurried\r\nto her assistance. I took her by the arm, and she let me lead her into\r\nthe drawing-room. Away from the lamp, in the deeper dusk of the distant\r\nend, the profile of Mrs. Haldin, her hands, her whole figure had\r\nthe stillness of a sombre painting. Miss Haldin stopped, and pointed\r\nmournfully at the tragic immobility of her mother, who seemed to watch a\r\nbeloved head lying in her lap.\r\n\r\nThat gesture had an unequalled force of expression, so far-reaching in\r\nits human distress that one could not believe that it pointed out merely\r\nthe ruthless working of political institutions. After assisting Miss\r\nHaldin to the sofa, I turned round to go back and shut the door Framed\r\nin the opening, in the searching glare of the white anteroom, my eyes\r\nfell on Razumov, still there, standing before the empty chair, as if\r\nrooted for ever to the spot of his atrocious confession. A wonder came\r\nover me that the mysterious force which had torn it out of him had\r\nfailed to destroy his life, to shatter his body. It was there unscathed.\r\nI stared at the broad line of his shoulders, his dark head, the amazing\r\nimmobility of his limbs. At his feet the veil dropped by Miss Haldin\r\nlooked intensely black in the white crudity of the light. He was gazing\r\nat it spell-bound. Next moment, stooping with an incredible, savage\r\nswiftness, he snatched it up and pressed it to his face with both hands.\r\nSomething, extreme astonishment perhaps, dimmed my eyes, so that he\r\nseemed to vanish before he moved.\r\n\r\nThe slamming of the outer door restored my sight, and I went on\r\ncontemplating the empty chair in the empty ante-room. The meaning\r\nof what I had seen reached my mind with a staggering shock. I seized\r\nNatalia Haldin by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat miserable wretch has carried off your veil!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, in the\r\nscared, deadened voice of an awful discovery. \xe2\x80\x9cHe....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest remained unspoken. I stepped back and looked down at her, in\r\nsilent horror. Her hands were lying lifelessly, palms upwards, on her\r\nlap. She raised her grey eyes slowly. Shadows seemed to come and go in\r\nthem as if the steady flame of her soul had been made to vacillate\r\nat last in the cross-currents of poisoned air from the corrupted dark\r\nimmensity claiming her for its own, where virtues themselves fester into\r\ncrimes in the cynicism of oppression and revolt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to be more unhappy....\xe2\x80\x9d The languid whisper of her\r\nvoice struck me with dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible.... I feel my heart\r\nbecoming like ice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nRazumov walked straight home on the wet glistening pavement. A heavy\r\nshower passed over him; distant lightning played faintly against the\r\nfronts of the dumb houses with the shuttered shops all along the Rue\r\nde Carouge; and now and then, after the faint flash, there was a faint,\r\nsleepy rumble; but the main forces of the thunderstorm remained\r\nmassed down the Rhone valley as if loath to attack the respectable and\r\npassionless abode of democratic liberty, the serious-minded town of\r\ndreary hotels, tendering the same indifferent, hospitality to tourists\r\nof all nations and to international conspirators of every shade.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the shop was making ready to close when Razumov entered and\r\nwithout a word extended his hand for the key of his room. On reaching\r\nit for him, from a shelf, the man was about to pass a small joke as to\r\ntaking the air in a thunderstorm, but, after looking at the face of his\r\nlodger, he only observed, just to say something--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got very wet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am washed clean,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumov, who was dripping from head\r\nto foot, and passed through the inner door towards the staircase leading\r\nto his room.\r\n\r\nHe did not change his clothes, but, after lighting the candle, took off\r\nhis watch and chain, laid them on the table, and sat down at once to\r\nwrite. The book of his compromising record was kept in a locked drawer,\r\nwhich he pulled out violently, and did not even trouble to push back\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nIn this queer pedantism of a man who had read, thought, lived, pen in\r\nhand, there is the sincerity of the attempt to grapple by the same means\r\nwith another profounder knowledge. After some passages which have been\r\nalready made use of in the building up of this narrative, or add nothing\r\nnew to the psychological side of this disclosure (there is even one more\r\nallusion to the silver medal in this last entry), comes a page and\r\na half of incoherent writing where his expression is baffled by the\r\nnovelty and the mysteriousness of that side of our emotional life to\r\nwhich his solitary existence had been a stranger. Then only he begins\r\nto address directly the reader he had in his mind, trying to express in\r\nbroken sentences, full of wonder and awe, the sovereign (he uses that\r\nvery word) power of her person over his imagination, in which lay the\r\ndormant seed of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... The most trustful eyes in the world--your brother said of you\r\nwhen he was as well as a dead man already. And when you stood before me\r\nwith your hand extended, I remembered the very sound of his voice, and\r\nI looked into your eyes--and that was enough. I knew that something had\r\nhappened, but I did not know then what.... But don\xe2\x80\x99t be deceived,\r\nNatalia Victorovna. I believed that I had in my breast nothing but an\r\ninexhaustible fund of anger and hate for you both. I remembered that he\r\nhad looked to you for the perpetuation of his visionary soul. He, this\r\nman who had robbed me of my hard-working, purposeful existence. I, too,\r\nhad my guiding idea; and remember that, amongst us, it is more difficult\r\nto lead a life of toil and self-denial than to go out in the street and\r\nkill from conviction. But enough of that. Hate or no hate, I felt at\r\nonce that, while shunning the sight of you, I could never succeed in\r\ndriving away your image. I would say, addressing that dead man, \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nthis the way you are going to haunt me?\xe2\x80\x99 It is only later on that I\r\nunderstood--only to-day, only a few hours ago. What could I have known\r\nof what was tearing me to pieces and dragging the secret for ever to\r\nmy lips? You were appointed to undo the evil by making me betray myself\r\nback into truth and peace. You! And you have done it in the same way,\r\ntoo, in which he ruined me: by forcing upon me your confidence. Only\r\nwhat I detested him for, in you ended by appearing noble and exalted.\r\nBut, I repeat, be not deceived. I was given up to evil. I exulted in\r\nhaving induced that silly innocent fool to steal his father\xe2\x80\x99s money. He\r\nwas a fool, but not a thief. I made him one. It was necessary. I had\r\nto confirm myself in my contempt and hate for what I betrayed. I have\r\nsuffered from as many vipers in my heart as any social democrat of them\r\nall--vanity, ambitions, jealousies, shameful desires, evil passions of\r\nenvy and revenge. I had my security stolen from me, years of good work,\r\nmy best hopes. Listen--now comes the true confession. The other was\r\nnothing. To save me, your trustful eyes had to entice my thought to the\r\nvery edge of the blackest treachery. I could see them constantly looking\r\nat me with the confidence of your pure heart which had not been touched\r\nby evil things. Victor Haldin had stolen the truth of my life from me,\r\nwho had nothing else in the world, and he boasted of living on through\r\nyou on this earth where I had no place to lay my head on. She will marry\r\nsome day, he had said--and your eyes were trustful. And do you know what\r\nI said to myself? I shall steal his sister\xe2\x80\x99s soul from her. When we met\r\nthat first morning in the gardens, and you spoke to me confidingly\r\nin the generosity of your spirit, I was thinking, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, he himself by\r\ntalking of her trustful eyes has delivered her into my hands!\xe2\x80\x99 If you\r\ncould have looked then into my heart, you would have cried out aloud\r\nwith terror and disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps no one will believe the baseness of such an intention to be\r\npossible. It\xe2\x80\x99s certain that, when we parted that morning, I gloated\r\nover it. I brooded upon the best way. The old man you introduced me to\r\ninsisted on walking with me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who he is. He talked of you,\r\nof your lonely, helpless state, and every word of that friend of yours\r\nwas egging me on to the unpardonable sin of stealing a soul. Could he\r\nhave been the devil himself in the shape of an old Englishman? Natalia\r\nVictorovna, I was possessed! I returned to look at you every day,\r\nand drink in your presence the poison of my infamous intention. But\r\nI foresaw difficulties. Then Sophia Antonovna, of whom I was not\r\nthinking--I had forgotten her existence--appears suddenly with that\r\ntale from St. Petersburg.... The only thing needed to make me safe--a\r\ntrusted revolutionist for ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was as if Ziemianitch had hanged himself to help me on to further\r\ncrime. The strength of falsehood seemed irresistible. These people\r\nstood doomed by the folly and the illusion that was in them--they being\r\nthemselves the slaves of lies. Natalia Victorovna, I embraced the might\r\nof falsehood, I exulted in it--I gave myself up to it for a time. Who\r\ncould have resisted! You yourself were the prize of it. I sat alone in\r\nmy room, planning a life, the very thought of which makes me shudder\r\nnow, like a believer who had been tempted to an atrocious sacrilege. But\r\nI brooded ardently over its images. The only thing was that there seemed\r\nto be no air in it. And also I was afraid of your mother. I never knew\r\nmine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never known any kind of love. There is something in the mere\r\nword.... Of you, I was not afraid--forgive me for telling you this.\r\nNo, not of you. You were truth itself. You could not suspect me. As to\r\nyour mother, you yourself feared already that her mind had given way\r\nfrom grief. Who could believe anything against me? Had not Ziemianitch\r\nhanged himself from remorse? I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s put it to the\r\ntest, and be done with it once for all.\xe2\x80\x99 I trembled when I went in;\r\nbut your mother hardly listened to what I was saying to her, and, in a\r\nlittle while, seemed to have forgotten my very existence. I sat looking\r\nat her. There was no longer anything between you and me. You were\r\ndefenceless--and soon, very soon, you would be alone.... I thought of\r\nyou. Defenceless. For days you have talked with me--opening your heart.\r\nI remembered the shadow of your eyelashes over your grey trustful eyes.\r\nAnd your pure forehead! It is low like the forehead of statues--calm,\r\nunstained. It was as if your pure brow bore a light which fell on me,\r\nsearched my heart and saved me from ignominy, from ultimate undoing.\r\nAnd it saved you too. Pardon my presumption. But there was that in your\r\nglances which seemed to tell me that you.... Your light! your truth!\r\nI felt that I must tell you that I had ended by loving you. And to tell\r\nyou that I must first confess. Confess, go out--and perish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly you stood before me! You alone in all the world to whom I\r\nmust confess. You fascinated me--you have freed me from the blindness of\r\nanger and hate--the truth shining in you drew the truth out of me. Now I\r\nhave done it; and as I write here, I am in the depths of anguish,\r\nbut there is air to breathe at last--air! And, by the by, that old man\r\nsprang up from somewhere as I was speaking to you, and raged at me like\r\na disappointed devil. I suffer horribly, but I am not in despair. There\r\nis only one more thing to do for me. After that--if they let me--I shall\r\ngo away and bury myself in obscure misery. In giving Victor Haldin up,\r\nit was myself, after all, whom I have betrayed most basely. You must\r\nbelieve what I say now, you can\xe2\x80\x99t refuse to believe this. Most basely.\r\nIt is through you that I came to feel this so deeply. After all, it is\r\nthey and not I who have the right on their side!--theirs is the\r\nstrength of invisible powers. So be it. Only don\xe2\x80\x99t be deceived, Natalia\r\nVictorovna, I am not converted. Have I then the soul of a slave? No! I\r\nam independent--and therefore perdition is my lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn these words, he stopped writing, shut the book, and wrapped it in the\r\nblack veil he had carried off. He then ransacked the drawers for\r\npaper and string, made up a parcel which he addressed to Miss Haldin,\r\nBoulevard des Philosophes, and then flung the pen away from him into a\r\ndistant corner.\r\n\r\nThis done, he sat down with the watch before him. He could have gone out\r\nat once, but the hour had not struck yet. The hour would be midnight.\r\nThere was no reason for that choice except that the facts and the words\r\nof a certain evening in his past were timing his conduct in the present.\r\nThe sudden power Natalia Haldin had gained over him he ascribed to the\r\nsame cause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t walk with impunity over a phantom\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he heard himself mutter. \xe2\x80\x9cThus he saves me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nhimself, the betrayed man.\xe2\x80\x9d The vivid image of Miss Haldin seemed to\r\nstand by him, watching him relentlessly. She was not disturbing. He had\r\ndone with life, and his thought even in her presence tried to take an\r\nimpartial survey. Now his scorn extended to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI had neither the\r\nsimplicity nor the courage nor the self-possession to be a scoundrel,\r\nor an exceptionally able man. For who, with us in Russia, is to tell a\r\nscoundrel from an exceptionally able man?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was the puppet of his past, because at the very stroke of midnight he\r\njumped up and ran swiftly downstairs as if confident that, by the power\r\nof destiny, the house door would fly open before the absolute necessity\r\nof his errand. And as a matter of fact, just as he got to the bottom\r\nof the stairs, it was opened for him by some people of the house coming\r\nhome late--two men and a woman. He slipped out through them into the\r\nstreet, swept then by a fitful gust of wind. They were, of course, very\r\nmuch startled. A flash of lightning enabled them to observe him walking\r\naway quickly. One of the men shouted, and was starting in pursuit, but\r\nthe woman had recognized him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right. It\xe2\x80\x99s only that young\r\nRussian from the third floor.\xe2\x80\x9d The darkness returned with a single clap\r\nof thunder, like a gun fired for a warning of his escape from the prison\r\nof lies.\r\n\r\nHe must have heard at some time or other and now remembered\r\nunconsciously that there was to be a gathering of revolutionists at the\r\nhouse of Julius Laspara that evening. At any rate, he made straight for\r\nthe Laspara house, and found himself without surprise ringing at its\r\nstreet door, which, of course, was closed. By that time the thunderstorm\r\nhad attacked in earnest. The steep incline of the street ran with water,\r\nthe thick fall of rain enveloped him like a luminous veil in the play\r\nof lightning. He was perfectly calm, and, between the crashes, listened\r\nattentively to the delicate tinkling of the doorbell somewhere within\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThere was some difficulty before he was admitted. His person was not\r\nknown to that one of the guests who had volunteered to go downstairs and\r\nsee what was the matter. Razumov argued with him patiently. There could\r\nbe no harm in admitting a caller. He had something to communicate to the\r\ncompany upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething of importance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll be for the hearers to judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrgent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime, one of the Laspara daughters descended the stairs, small lamp\r\nin hand, in a grimy and crumpled gown, which seemed to hang on her by a\r\nmiracle, and looking more than ever like an old doll with a dusty brown\r\nwig, dragged from under a sofa. She recognized Razumov at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do? Of course you may come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowing her light, Razumov climbed two flights of stairs from the\r\nlower darkness. Leaving the lamp on a bracket on the landing, she opened\r\na door, and went in, accompanied by the sceptical guest. Razumov entered\r\nlast. He closed the door behind him, and stepping on one side, put his\r\nback against the wall.\r\n\r\nThe three little rooms _en suite_, with low, smoky ceilings and lit by\r\nparaffin lamps, were crammed with people. Loud talking was going on\r\nin all three, and tea-glasses, full, half-full, and empty, stood\r\neverywhere, even on the floor. The other Laspara girl sat, dishevelled\r\nand languid, behind an enormous samovar. In the inner doorway Razumov\r\nhad a glimpse of the protuberance of a large stomach, which he\r\nrecognized. Only a few feet from him Julius Laspara was getting down\r\nhurriedly from his high stool.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the midnight visitor caused no small sensation.\r\nLaspara is very summary in his version of that night\xe2\x80\x99s happenings.\r\nAfter some words of greeting, disregarded by Razumov, Laspara (ignoring\r\npurposely his guest\xe2\x80\x99s soaked condition and his extraordinary manner of\r\npresenting himself) mentioned something about writing an article. He\r\nwas growing uneasy, and Razumov appeared absent-minded. \xe2\x80\x9cI have written\r\nalready all I shall ever write,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, with a little laugh.\r\n\r\nThe whole company\xe2\x80\x99s attention was riveted on the new-comer, dripping\r\nwith water, deadly pale, and keeping his position against the wall.\r\nRazumov put Laspara gently aside, as though he wished to be seen from\r\nhead to foot by everybody. By then the buzz of conversations had died\r\ndown completely, even in the most distant of the three rooms. The\r\ndoorway facing Razumov became blocked by men and women, who craned their\r\nnecks and certainly seemed to expect something startling to happen.\r\n\r\nA squeaky, insolent declaration was heard from that group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know this ridiculously conceited individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat individual?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Razumov, raising his bowed head, and searching\r\nwith his eyes all the eyes fixed upon him. An intense surprised silence\r\nlasted for a time. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, thinking over the form of his confession, and found it\r\nsuddenly, unavoidably suggested by the fateful evening of his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am come here,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in a clear voice, \xe2\x80\x9cto talk of an individual\r\ncalled Ziemianitch. Sophia Antonovna has informed me that she would make\r\npublic a certain letter from St. Petersburg....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSophia Antonovna has left us early in the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laspara. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite correct. Everybody here has heard....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov interrupted, with a shade of impatience, for his\r\nheart was beating strongly. Then, mastering his voice so far that there\r\nwas even a touch of irony in his clear, forcible enunciation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn justice to that individual, the much ill-used peasant, Ziemianitch,\r\nI now declare solemnly that the conclusions of that letter calumniate a\r\nman of the people--a bright Russian soul. Ziemianitch had nothing to do\r\nwith the actual arrest of Victor Haldin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov dwelt on the name heavily, and then waited till the faint,\r\nmournful murmur which greeted it had died out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictor Victorovitch Haldin,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again, \xe2\x80\x9cacting with, no doubt,\r\nnoble-minded imprudence, took refuge with a certain student of whose\r\nopinions he knew nothing but what his own illusions suggested to his\r\ngenerous heart. It was an unwise display of confidence. But I am not\r\nhere to appreciate the actions of Victor Haldin. Am I to tell you of\r\nthe feelings of that student, sought out in his obscure solitude, and\r\nmenaced by the complicity forced upon him? Am I to tell you what he did?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a rather complicated story. In the end the student went to General\r\nT--- himself, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I have the man who killed de P--- locked up in\r\nmy room, Victor Haldin--a student like myself.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great buzz arose, in which Razumov raised his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve--that man had certain honest ideals in view. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nhere to explain him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But you must explain how you know all this,\xe2\x80\x9d came in grave tones\r\nfrom somebody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA vile coward!\xe2\x80\x9d This simple cry vibrated with indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cName him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n shouted other voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you clamouring for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumov disdainfully, in the\r\nprofound silence which fell on the raising of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you all\r\nunderstood that I am that man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaspara went away brusquely from his side and climbed upon his stool.\r\nIn the first forward surge of people towards him, Razumov expected to\r\nbe torn to pieces, but they fell back without touching him, and nothing\r\ncame of it but noise. It was bewildering. His head ached terribly.\r\nIn the confused uproar he made out several times the name of Peter\r\nIvanovitch, the word \xe2\x80\x9cjudgement,\xe2\x80\x9d and the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is a\r\nconfession,\xe2\x80\x9d uttered by somebody in a desperate shriek. In the midst\r\nof the tumult, a young man, younger than himself, approached him with\r\nblazing eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with venomous politeness, \xe2\x80\x9cto be good enough\r\nnot to move from this spot till you are told what you are to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cI came in voluntarily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t go out till you are permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned with his hand, calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cLouisa! Louisa! come here,\r\nplease\xe2\x80\x9d; and, presently, one of the Laspara girls (they had been staring\r\nat Razumov from behind the samovar) came along, trailing a bedraggled\r\ntail of dirty flounces, and dragging with her a chair, which she set\r\nagainst the door, and, sitting down on it, crossed her legs. The young\r\nman thanked her effusively, and rejoined a group carrying on an animated\r\ndiscussion in low tones. Razumov lost himself for a moment.\r\n\r\nA squeaky voice screamed, \xe2\x80\x9cConfession or no confession, you are a police\r\nspy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe revolutionist Nikita had pushed his way in front of Razumov, and\r\nfaced him with his big, livid cheeks, his heavy paunch, bull neck, and\r\nenormous hands. Razumov looked at the famous slayer of gendarmes in\r\nsilent disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, very low, then shut his eyes, and rested\r\nthe back of his head against the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better for you to depart now.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumov heard a mild, sad\r\nvoice, and opened his eyes. The gentle speaker was an elderly man, with\r\na great brush of fine hair making a silvery halo all round his\r\nkeen, intelligent face. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch shall be informed of your\r\nconfession--and you shall be directed....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Nikita, nicknamed Necator, standing by, he appealed to\r\nhim in a murmur--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else can we do? After this piece of sincerity he cannot be\r\ndangerous any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cBetter make sure of that before we let him go.\r\nLeave that to me. I know how to deal with such gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe exchanged meaning glances with two or three men, who nodded slightly,\r\nthen turning roughly to Razumov, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard? You are not wanted\r\nhere. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Laspara girl on guard rose, and pulled the chair out of the way\r\nunemotionally. She gave a sleepy stare to Razumov, who started, looked\r\nround the room and passed slowly by her as if struck by some sudden\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to observe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, already on the landing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had\r\nonly to hold my tongue. To-day, of all days since I came amongst you,\r\nI was made safe, and to-day I made myself free from falsehood, from\r\nremorse--independent of every single human being on this earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on the room, and walked towards the stairs, but, at\r\nthe violent crash of the door behind him, he looked over his shoulder\r\nand saw that Nikita, with three others, had followed him out. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\ngoing to kill me, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nBefore he had time to turn round and confront them fairly, they set\r\non him with a rush. He was driven headlong against the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder\r\nhow,\xe2\x80\x9d he completed his thought. Nikita cried, with a shrill laugh right\r\nin his face, \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall make you harmless. You wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumov did not struggle. The three men held him pinned against\r\nthe wall, while Nikita, taking up a position a little on one side,\r\ndeliberately swung off his enormous arm. Razumov, looking for a knife\r\nin his hand, saw it come at him open, unarmed, and received a tremendous\r\nblow on the side of his head over his ear. At the same time he heard a\r\nfaint, dull detonating sound, as if some one had fired a pistol on the\r\nother side of the wall. A raging fury awoke in him at this outrage.\r\nThe people in Laspara\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, holding their breath, listened to the\r\ndesperate scuffling of four men all over the landing; thuds against the\r\nwalls, a terrible crash against the very door, then all of them went\r\ndown together with a violence which seemed to shake the whole house.\r\nRazumov, overpowered, breathless, crushed under the weight of his\r\nassailants, saw the monstrous Nikita squatting on his heels near his\r\nhead, while the others held him down, kneeling on his chest, gripping\r\nhis throat, lying across his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn his face the other way,\xe2\x80\x9d the paunchy terrorist directed, in an\r\nexcited, gleeful squeak.\r\n\r\nRazumov could struggle no longer. He was exhausted; he had to watch\r\npassively the heavy open hand of the brute descend again in a degrading\r\nblow over his other ear. It seemed to split his head in two, and all at\r\nonce the men holding him became perfectly silent--soundless as shadows.\r\nIn silence they pulled him brutally to his feet, rushed with him\r\nnoiselessly down the staircase, and, opening the door, flung him out\r\ninto the street.\r\n\r\nHe fell forward, and at once rolled over and over helplessly, going down\r\nthe short slope together with the rush of running rain water. He came to\r\nrest in the roadway of the street at the bottom, lying on his back,\r\nwith a great flash of lightning over his face--a vivid, silent flash of\r\nlightning which blinded him utterly. He picked himself up, and put his\r\narm over his eyes to recover his sight. Not a sound reached him from\r\nanywhere, and he began to walk, staggering, down a long, empty street.\r\nThe lightning waved and darted round him its silent flames, the water of\r\nthe deluge fell, ran, leaped, drove--noiseless like the drift of mist.\r\nIn this unearthly stillness his footsteps fell silent on the pavement,\r\nwhile a dumb wind drove him on and on, like a lost mortal in a phantom\r\nworld ravaged by a soundless thunderstorm. God only knows where his\r\nnoiseless feet took him to that night, here and there, and back again\r\nwithout pause or rest. Of one place, at least, where they did lead\r\nhim, we heard afterwards; and, in the morning, the driver of the first\r\nsouth-shore tramcar, clanging his bell desperately, saw a bedraggled,\r\nsoaked man without a hat, and walking in the roadway unsteadily with his\r\nhead down, step right in front of his car, and go under.\r\n\r\nWhen they picked him up, with two broken limbs and a crushed side,\r\nRazumov had not lost consciousness. It was as though he had tumbled,\r\nsmashing himself, into a world of mutes. Silent men, moving unheard,\r\nlifted him up, laid him on the sidewalk, gesticulating and grimacing\r\nround him their alarm, horror, and compassion. A red face with\r\nmoustaches stooped close over him, lips moving, eyes rolling. Razumov\r\ntried hard to understand the reason of this dumb show. To those who\r\nstood around him, the features of that stranger, so grievously hurt,\r\nseemed composed in meditation. Afterwards his eyes sent out at them\r\na look of fear and closed slowly. They stared at him. Razumov made an\r\neffort to remember some French words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Je suis sourd_,\xe2\x80\x9d he had time to utter feebly, before he fainted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is deaf,\xe2\x80\x9d they exclaimed to each other. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why he did not hear\r\nthe car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey carried him off in that same car. Before it started on its journey,\r\na woman in a shabby black dress, who had run out of the iron gate of\r\nsome private grounds up the road, clambered on to the rear platform and\r\nwould not be put off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a relation,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted, in bad French. \xe2\x80\x9cThis young man is a\r\nRussian, and I am his relation.\xe2\x80\x9d On this plea they let her have her way.\r\nShe sat down calmly, and took his head on her lap; her scared faded eyes\r\navoided looking at his deathlike face. At the corner of a street, on the\r\nother side of the town, a stretcher met the car. She followed it to the\r\ndoor of the hospital, where they let her come in and see him laid on a\r\nbed. Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s new-found relation never shed a tear, but the officials\r\nhad some difficulty in inducing her to go away. The porter observed her\r\nlingering on the opposite pavement for a long time. Suddenly, as though\r\nshe had remembered something, she ran off.\r\n\r\nThe ardent hater of all Finance ministers, the slave of Madame de S--,\r\nhad made up her mind to offer her resignation as lady companion to\r\nthe Egeria of Peter Ivanovitch. She had found work to do after her own\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut hours before, while the thunderstorm still raged in the night, there\r\nhad been in the rooms of Julius Laspara a great sensation. The terrible\r\nNikita, coming in from the landing, uplifted his squeaky voice in\r\nhorrible glee before all the company--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRazumov! Mr. Razumov! The wonderful Razumov! He shall never be any use\r\nas a spy on any one. He won\xe2\x80\x99t talk, because he will never hear anything\r\nin his life--not a thing! I have burst the drums of his ears for him.\r\nOh, you may trust me. I know the trick. Ha! Ha! Ha! I know the trick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a fortnight after her mother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral that I saw Natalia\r\nHaldin for the last time.\r\n\r\nIn those silent, sombre days the doors of the _appartement_ on the\r\nBoulevard des Philosophes were closed to every one but myself. I believe\r\nI was of some use, if only in this, that I alone was aware of the\r\nincredible part of the situation. Miss Haldin nursed her mother alone\r\nto the last moment. If Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s visit had anything to do with\r\nMrs. Haldin\xe2\x80\x99s end (and I cannot help thinking that it hastened it\r\nconsiderably), it is because the man, trusted impulsively by the\r\nill-fated Victor Haldin, had failed to gain the confidence of Victor\r\nHaldin\xe2\x80\x99s mother. What tale, precisely, he told her cannot be known--at\r\nany rate, I do not know it--but to me she seemed to die from the shock\r\nof an ultimate disappointment borne in silence. She had not believed\r\nhim. Perhaps she could no longer believe any one, and consequently had\r\nnothing to say to any one--not even to her daughter. I suspect that Miss\r\nHaldin lived the heaviest hours of her life by that silent death-bed.\r\nI confess I was angry with the broken-hearted old woman passing away in\r\nthe obstinacy of her mute distrust of her daughter.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over I stood aside. Miss Haldin had her compatriots\r\nround her then. A great number of them attended the funeral. I was\r\nthere too, but afterwards managed to keep away from Miss Haldin, till I\r\nreceived a short note rewarding my self-denial. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is as you would have\r\nit. I am going back to Russia at once. My mind is made up. Come and see\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVerily, it was a reward of discretion. I went without delay to receive\r\nit. The _appartement_ of the Boulevard des Philosophes presented the\r\ndreary signs of impending abandonment. It looked desolate and as if\r\nalready empty to my eyes.\r\n\r\nStanding, we exchanged a few words about her health, mine, remarks as to\r\nsome people of the Russian colony, and then Natalia Haldin, establishing\r\nme on the sofa, began to talk openly of her future work, of her plans.\r\nIt was all to be as I had wished it. And it was to be for life. We\r\nshould never see each other again. Never!\r\n\r\nI gathered this success to my breast. Natalia Haldin looked matured by\r\nher open and secret experiences. With her arms folded she walked up and\r\ndown the whole length of the room, talking slowly, smooth-browed, with a\r\nresolute profile. She gave me a new view of herself, and I marvelled at\r\nthat something grave and measured in her voice, in her movements, in her\r\nmanner. It was the perfection of collected independence. The strength\r\nof her nature had come to surface because the obscure depths had been\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe two can talk of it now,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, after a silence and stopping\r\nshort before me. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to inquire at the hospital lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have.\xe2\x80\x9d And as she looked at me fixedly, \xe2\x80\x9cHe will live, the\r\ndoctors say. But I thought that Tekla....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTekla has not been near me for several days,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Miss Haldin\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I never offered to go to the hospital with her, she thinks\r\nthat I have no heart. She is disillusioned about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Haldin smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She sits with him as long and as often as they will let her,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says she must never abandon him--never as long as she lives.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll need somebody--a hopeless cripple, and stone deaf with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStone deaf? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Natalia Haldin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is. It seems strange. I am told there were no apparent injuries to\r\nthe head. They say, too, that it is not very likely that he will live so\r\nvery long for Tekla to take care of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haldin shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile there are travellers ready to fall by the way our Tekla shall\r\nnever be idle. She is a good Samaritan by an irresistible vocation. The\r\nrevolutionists didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand her. Fancy a devoted creature like that\r\nbeing employed to carry about documents sewn in her dress, or made to\r\nwrite from dictation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not much perspicacity in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner uttered, I regretted that observation. Natalia Haldin, looking\r\nme straight in the face, assented by a slight movement of her head. She\r\nwas not offended, but turning away began to pace the room again. To my\r\nwestern eyes she seemed to be getting farther and farther from me, quite\r\nbeyond my reach now, but undiminished in the increasing distance. I\r\nremained silent as though it were hopeless to raise my voice. The sound\r\nof hers, so close to me, made me start a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTekla saw him picked up after the accident. The good soul never\r\nexplained to me really how it came about. She affirms that there was\r\nsome understanding between them--some sort of compact--that in any sore\r\nneed, in misfortune, or difficulty, or pain, he was to come to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is lucky for him that there was, then. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nneed all the devotion of the good Samaritan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a fact that Tekla, looking out of her window at five in the\r\nmorning, for some reason or other, had beheld Razumov in the grounds of\r\nthe Chateau Borel, standing stockstill, bare-headed in the rain, at the\r\nfoot of the terrace. She had screamed out to him, by name, to know\r\nwhat was the matter. He never even raised his head. By the time she had\r\ndressed herself sufficiently to run downstairs he was gone. She started\r\nin pursuit, and rushing out into the road, came almost directly upon the\r\narrested tramcar and the small knot of people picking up Razumov. That\r\nmuch Tekla had told me herself one afternoon we happened to meet at the\r\ndoor of the hospital, and without any kind of comment. But I did not\r\nwant to meditate very long on the inwardness of this peculiar episode.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Natalia Victorovna, he shall need somebody when they dismiss him,\r\non crutches and stone deaf from the hospital. But I do not think that\r\nwhen he rushed like an escaped madman into the grounds of the Chateau\r\nBorel it was to seek the help of that good Tekla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Natalia, stopping short before me, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat\r\ndown and leaned her head on her hand thoughtfully. The silence lasted\r\nfor several minutes. During that time I remembered the evening of his\r\natrocious confession--the plaint she seemed to have hardly enough life\r\nleft in her to utter, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to be more unhappy....\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nrecollection would have given me a shudder if I had not been lost\r\nin wonder at her force and her tranquillity. There was no longer any\r\nNatalia Haldin, because she had completely ceased to think of herself.\r\nIt was a great victory, a characteristically Russian exploit in\r\nself-suppression.\r\n\r\nShe recalled me to myself by getting up suddenly like a person who has\r\ncome to a decision. She walked to the writing-table, now stripped of all\r\nthe small objects associated with her by daily use--a mere piece of dead\r\nfurniture; but it contained something living, still, since she took from\r\na recess a flat parcel which she brought to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a book,\xe2\x80\x9d she said rather abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was sent to me wrapped\r\nup in my veil. I told you nothing at the time, but now I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to\r\nleave it with you. I have the right to do that. It was sent to me. It\r\nis mine. You may preserve it, or destroy it after you have read it. And\r\nwhile you read it, please remember that I was defenceless. And that\r\nhe..\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefenceless!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, surprised, looking hard at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find the very word written there,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrue! I _was_ defenceless--but perhaps you were able to see that for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Her face coloured, then went deadly pale. \xe2\x80\x9cIn justice to the\r\nman, I want you to remember that I was. Oh, I was, I was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose, a little shakily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not likely to forget anything you say at this our last parting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand fell into mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to believe that it must be good-bye with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned my pressure and our hands separated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am leaving here to-morrow. My eyes are open at last and my hands\r\nare free now. As for the rest--which of us can fail to hear the stifled\r\ncry of our great distress? It may be nothing to the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe world is more conscious of your discordant voices,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nthe way of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She bowed her head in assent, and hesitated for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nown to you that I shall never give up looking forward to the day when\r\nall discord shall be silenced. Try to imagine its dawn! The tempest of\r\nblows and of execrations is over; all is still; the new sun is rising,\r\nand the weary men united at last, taking count in their conscience of\r\nthe ended contest, feel saddened by their victory, because so many ideas\r\nhave perished for the triumph of one, so many beliefs have abandoned\r\nthem without support. They feel alone on the earth and gather close\r\ntogether. Yes, there must be many bitter hours! But at last the anguish\r\nof hearts shall be extinguished in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd on this last word of her wisdom, a word so sweet, so bitter, so\r\ncruel sometimes, I said good-bye to Natalia Haldin. It is hard to think\r\nI shall never look any more into the trustful eyes of that girl--wedded\r\nto an invincible belief in the advent of loving concord springing like\r\na heavenly flower from the soil of men\xe2\x80\x99s earth, soaked in blood, torn by\r\nstruggles, watered with tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that at that time I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything of Mr.\r\nRazumov\xe2\x80\x99s confession to the assembled revolutionists. Natalia Haldin\r\nmight have guessed what was the \xe2\x80\x9cone thing more\xe2\x80\x9d which remained for him\r\nto do; but this my western eyes had failed to see.\r\n\r\nTekla, the ex-lady companion of Madame de S--, haunted his bedside at\r\nthe hospital. We met once or twice at the door of that establishment,\r\nbut on these occasions she was not communicative. She gave me news of\r\nMr. Razumov as concisely as possible. He was making a slow recovery, but\r\nwould remain a hopeless cripple all his life. Personally, I never went\r\nnear him: I never saw him again, after the awful evening when I stood\r\nby, a watchful but ignored spectator of his scene with Miss Haldin. He\r\nwas in due course discharged from the hospital, and his \xe2\x80\x9crelative\xe2\x80\x9d--so I\r\nwas told--had carried him off somewhere.\r\n\r\nMy information was completed nearly two years later. The opportunity,\r\ncertainly, was not of my seeking; it was quite accidentally that I met a\r\nmuch-trusted woman revolutionist at the house of a distinguished Russian\r\ngentleman of liberal convictions, who came to live in Geneva for a time.\r\n\r\nHe was a quite different sort of celebrity from Peter Ivanovitch--a\r\ndark-haired man with kind eyes, high-shouldered, courteous, and with\r\nsomething hushed and circumspect in his manner. He approached\r\nme, choosing the moment when there was no one near, followed by a\r\ngrey-haired, alert lady in a crimson blouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Sophia Antonovna wishes to be made known to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he addressed me,\r\nin his guarded voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I leave you two to have a talk together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would never have intruded myself upon your notice,\xe2\x80\x9d the grey-haired\r\nlady began at once, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had not been charged with a message for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a message of a few friendly words from Natalia Haldin. Sophia\r\nAntonovna had just returned from a secret excursion into Russia, and\r\nhad seen Miss Haldin. She lived in a town \xe2\x80\x9cin the centre,\xe2\x80\x9d sharing her\r\ncompassionate labours between the horrors of overcrowded jails, and the\r\nheartrending misery of bereaved homes. She did not spare herself in good\r\nservice, Sophia Antonovna assured me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a faithful soul, an undaunted spirit and an indefatigable\r\nbody,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman revolutionist summed it all up, with a touch of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nA conversation thus engaged was not likely to drop from want of interest\r\non my side. We went to sit apart in a corner where no one interrupted\r\nus. In the course of our talk about Miss Haldin, Sophia Antonovna\r\nremarked suddenly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you remember seeing me before? That evening when Natalia came\r\nto ask Peter Ivanovitch for the address of a certain Razumov, that young\r\nman who...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. When Sophia Antonovna learned that I had\r\nin my possession that young man\xe2\x80\x99s journal given me by Miss Haldin she\r\nbecame intensely interested. She did not conceal her curiosity to see\r\nthe document.\r\n\r\nI offered to show it to her, and she at once volunteered to call on me\r\nnext day for that purpose.\r\n\r\nShe turned over the pages greedily for an hour or more, and then handed\r\nme the book with a faint sigh. While moving about Russia, she had seen\r\nRazumov too. He lived, not \xe2\x80\x9cin the centre,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cin the south.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ndescribed to me a little two-roomed wooden house, in the suburb of some\r\nvery small town, hiding within the high plank-fence of a yard overgrown\r\nwith nettles. He was crippled, ill, getting weaker every day, and Tekla\r\nthe Samaritan tended him unweariedly with the pure joy of unselfish\r\ndevotion. There was nothing in that task to become disillusioned about.\r\n\r\nI did not hide from Sophia Antonovna my surprise that she should have\r\nvisited Mr. Razumov. I did not even understand the motive. But she\r\ninformed me that she was not the only one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of _us_ always go to see him when passing through. He is\r\nintelligent. He has ideas.... He talks well, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently I heard for the first time of Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s public confession in\r\nLaspara\xe2\x80\x99s house. Sophia Antonovna gave me a detailed relation of what\r\nhad occurred there. Razumov himself had told her all about it, most\r\nminutely.\r\n\r\nThen, looking hard at me with her brilliant black eyes--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are evil moments in every life. A false suggestion enters one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrain, and then fear is born--fear of oneself, fear for oneself. Or else\r\na false courage--who knows? Well, call it what you like; but tell me,\r\nhow many of them would deliver themselves up deliberately to perdition\r\n(as he himself says in that book) rather than go on living, secretly\r\ndebased in their own eyes? How many?... And please mark this--he\r\nwas safe when he did it. It was just when he believed himself safe\r\nand more--infinitely more--when the possibility of being loved by\r\nthat admirable girl first dawned upon him, that he discovered that his\r\nbitterest railings, the worst wickedness, the devil work of his hate and\r\npride, could never cover up the ignominy of the existence before him.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s character in such a discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accepted her conclusion in silence. Who would care to question the\r\ngrounds of forgiveness or compassion? However, it appeared later on,\r\nthat there was some compunction, too, in the charity extended by the\r\nrevolutionary world to Razumov the betrayer. Sophia Antonovna continued\r\nuneasily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, you know, he was the victim of an outrage. It was not\r\nauthorized. Nothing was decided as to what was to be done with him. He\r\nhad confessed voluntarily. And that Nikita who burst the drums of his\r\nears purposely, out on the landing, you know, as if carried away by\r\nindignation--well, he has turned out to be a scoundrel of the worst\r\nkind--a traitor himself, a betrayer--a spy! Razumov told me he had\r\ncharged him with it by a sort of inspiration....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a glimpse of that brute,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow any of you could have been\r\ndeceived for half a day passes my comprehension!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! There! Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of it. The first time I saw him, I, too, was\r\nappalled. They cried me down. We were always telling each other, \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\r\nyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind his appearance.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he was always ready to kill.\r\nThere was no doubt of it. He killed--yes! in both camps. The fiend....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Sophia Antonovna, after mastering the angry trembling of her lips,\r\ntold me a very queer tale. It went that Councillor Mikulin, travelling\r\nin Germany (shortly after Razumov\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance from Geneva), happened\r\nto meet Peter Ivanovitch in a railway carriage. Being alone in the\r\ncompartment, these two talked together half the night, and it was then\r\nthat Mikulin the Police Chief gave a hint to the Arch-Revolutionist\r\nas to the true character of the arch-slayer of gendarmes. It looks as\r\nthough Mikulin had wanted to get rid of that particular agent of his\r\nown! He might have grown tired of him, or frightened of him. It must\r\nalso be said that Mikulin had inherited the sinister Nikita from his\r\npredecessor in office.\r\n\r\nAnd this story, too, I received without comment in my character of a\r\nmute witness of things Russian, unrolling their Eastern logic under my\r\nWestern eyes. But I permitted myself a question--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, please, Sophia Antonovna, did Madame de S-- leave all her\r\nfortune to Peter Ivanovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it.\xe2\x80\x9d The woman revolutionist shrugged her shoulders in\r\ndisgust. \xe2\x80\x9cShe died without making a will. A lot of nephews and nieces\r\ncame down from St. Petersburg, like a flock of vultures, and fought\r\nfor her money amongst themselves. All beastly Kammerherrs and Maids of\r\nHonour--abominable court flunkeys. Tfui!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne does not hear much of Peter Ivanovitch now,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sophia Antonovna gravely, \xe2\x80\x9chas united himself\r\nto a peasant girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was truly astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! On the Riviera?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense! Of course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna\xe2\x80\x99s tone was slightly tart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he, then, living actually in Russia? It\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous risk--isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all for the sake of a peasant girl. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very wrong of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna preserved a mysterious silence for a while, then made a\r\nstatement. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just simply adores her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he? Well, then, I hope that she won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to beat him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSophia Antonovna got up and wished me good-bye, as though she had not\r\nheard a word of my impious hope; but, in the very doorway, where I\r\nattended her, she turned round for an instant, and declared in a firm\r\nvoice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Ivanovitch is an inspired man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Under Western Eyes, by Joseph Conrad\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNDER WESTERN EYES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2480-0.txt or 2480-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/8/2480/\r\n\r\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
