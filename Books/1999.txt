All\r\nthe trains--the few that there were--stopped at all the stations.\r\nDenis knew the names of those stations by heart. Bole, Tritton,\r\nSpavin Delawarr, Knipswich for Timpany, West Bowlby, and, finally,\r\nCamlet-on-the-Water. Camlet was where he always got out, leaving the\r\ntrain to creep indolently onward, goodness only knew whither, into the\r\ngreen heart of England.\r\n\r\nThey were snorting out of West Bowlby now. It was the next station,\r\nthank Heaven. Denis took his chattels off the rack and piled them neatly\r\nin the corner opposite his own. A futile proceeding. But one must have\r\nsomething to do. When he had finished, he sank back into his seat and\r\nclosed his eyes. It was extremely hot.\r\n\r\nOh, this journey! It was two hours cut clean out of his life; two hours\r\nin which he might have done so much, so much--written the perfect poem,\r\nfor example, or read the one illuminating book. Instead of which--his\r\ngorge rose at the smell of the dusty cushions against which he was\r\nleaning.\r\n\r\nTwo hours. One hundred and twenty minutes. Anything might be done in\r\nthat time. Anything. Nothing. Oh, he had had hundreds of hours, and what\r\nhad he done with them? Wasted them, spilt the precious minutes as though\r\nhis reservoir were inexhaustible. Denis groaned in the spirit, condemned\r\nhimself utterly with all his works. What right had he to sit in the\r\nsunshine, to occupy corner seats in third-class carriages, to be alive?\r\nNone, none, none.\r\n\r\nMisery and a nameless nostalgic distress possessed him. He was\r\ntwenty-three, and oh! so agonizingly conscious of the fact.\r\n\r\nThe train came bumpingly to a halt. Here was Camlet at last. Denis\r\njumped up, crammed his hat over his eyes, deranged his pile of baggage,\r\nleaned out of the window and shouted for a porter, seized a bag in\r\neither hand, and had to put them down again in order to open the door.\r\nWhen at last he had safely bundled himself and his baggage on to the\r\nplatform, he ran up the train towards the van.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bicycle, a bicycle!\xe2\x80\x9d he said breathlessly to the guard. He felt\r\nhimself a man of action. The guard paid no attention, but continued\r\nmethodically to hand out, one by one, the packages labelled to Camlet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bicycle!\xe2\x80\x9d Denis repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cA green machine, cross-framed, name of\r\nStone. S-T-O-N-E.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard soothingly. He was a large,\r\nstately man with a naval beard. One pictured him at home, drinking tea,\r\nsurrounded by a numerous family. It was in that tone that he must have\r\nspoken to his children when they were tiresome. \xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Denis\xe2\x80\x99s man of action collapsed, punctured.\r\n\r\nHe left his luggage to be called for later, and pushed off on his\r\nbicycle. He always took his bicycle when he went into the country. It\r\nwas part of the theory of exercise. One day one would get up at six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock and pedal away to Kenilworth, or Stratford-on-Avon--anywhere.\r\nAnd within a radius of twenty miles there were always Norman churches\r\nand Tudor mansions to be seen in the course of an afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s excursion.\r\nSomehow they never did get seen, but all the same it was nice to feel\r\nthat the bicycle was there, and that one fine morning one really might\r\nget up at six.\r\n\r\nOnce at the top of the long hill which led up from Camlet station, he\r\nfelt his spirits mounting. The world, he found, was good. The far-away\r\nblue hills, the harvests whitening on the slopes of the ridge along\r\nwhich his road led him, the treeless sky-lines that changed as he\r\nmoved--yes, they were all good. He was overcome by the beauty of those\r\ndeeply embayed combes, scooped in the flanks of the ridge beneath him.\r\nCurves, curves: he repeated the word slowly, trying as he did so to find\r\nsome term in which to give expression to his appreciation. Curves--no,\r\nthat was inadequate. He made a gesture with his hand, as though to scoop\r\nthe achieved expression out of the air, and almost fell off his bicycle.\r\nWhat was the word to describe the curves of those little valleys? They\r\nwere as fine as the lines of a human body, they were informed with the\r\nsubtlety of art...\r\n\r\nGalbe. That was a good word; but it was French. Le galbe evase de ses\r\nhanches: had one ever read a French novel in which that phrase didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\noccur? Some day he would compile a dictionary for the use of novelists.\r\nGalbe, gonfle, goulu: parfum, peau, pervers, potele, pudeur: vertu,\r\nvolupte.\r\n\r\nBut he really must find that word. Curves curves...Those little valleys\r\nhad the lines of a cup moulded round a woman\xe2\x80\x99s breast; they seemed the\r\ndinted imprints of some huge divine body that had rested on these hills.\r\nCumbrous locutions, these; but through them he seemed to be getting\r\nnearer to what he wanted. Dinted, dimpled, wimpled--his mind wandered\r\ndown echoing corridors of assonance and alliteration ever further and\r\nfurther from the point. He was enamoured with the beauty of words.\r\n\r\nBecoming once more aware of the outer world, he found himself on the\r\ncrest of a descent. The road plunged down, steep and straight, into a\r\nconsiderable valley. There, on the opposite slope, a little higher up\r\nthe valley, stood Crome, his destination. He put on his brakes; this\r\nview of Crome was pleasant to linger over. The facade with its three\r\nprojecting towers rose precipitously from among the dark trees of the\r\ngarden. The house basked in full sunlight; the old brick rosily glowed.\r\nHow ripe and rich it was, how superbly mellow! And at the same time, how\r\naustere! The hill was becoming steeper and steeper; he was gaining\r\nspeed in spite of his brakes. He loosed his grip of the levers, and in\r\na moment was rushing headlong down. Five minutes later he was passing\r\nthrough the gate of the great courtyard. The front door stood hospitably\r\nopen. He left his bicycle leaning against the wall and walked in. He\r\nwould take them by surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHe took nobody by surprise; there was nobody to take. All was quiet;\r\nDenis wandered from room to empty room, looking with pleasure at the\r\nfamiliar pictures and furniture, at all the little untidy signs of life\r\nthat lay scattered here and there. He was rather glad that they were\r\nall out; it was amusing to wander through the house as though one\r\nwere exploring a dead, deserted Pompeii. What sort of life would the\r\nexcavator reconstruct from these remains; how would he people these\r\nempty chambers? There was the long gallery, with its rows of respectable\r\nand (though, of course, one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t publicly admit it) rather boring\r\nItalian primitives, its Chinese sculptures, its unobtrusive, dateless\r\nfurniture. There was the panelled drawing-room, where the huge\r\nchintz-covered arm-chairs stood, oases of comfort among the austere\r\nflesh-mortifying antiques. There was the morning-room, with its pale\r\nlemon walls, its painted Venetian chairs and rococo tables, its mirrors,\r\nits modern pictures. There was the library, cool, spacious, and dark,\r\nbook-lined from floor to ceiling, rich in portentous folios. There was\r\nthe dining-room, solidly, portwinily English, with its great\r\nmahogany table, its eighteenth-century chairs and sideboard, its\r\neighteenth-century pictures--family portraits, meticulous animal\r\npaintings. What could one reconstruct from such data? There was much of\r\nHenry Wimbush in the long gallery and the library, something of Anne,\r\nperhaps, in the morning-room. That was all. Among the accumulations of\r\nten generations the living had left but few traces.\r\n\r\nLying on the table in the morning-room he saw his own book of poems.\r\nWhat tact! He picked it up and opened it. It was what the reviewers call\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca slim volume.\xe2\x80\x9d He read at hazard:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9d...But silence and the topless dark\r\n\r\n               Vault in the lights of Luna Park;\r\n\r\n               And Blackpool from the nightly gloom\r\n\r\n               Hollows a bright tumultuous tomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put it down again, shook his head, and sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat genius I had\r\nthen!\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, echoing the aged Swift. It was nearly six months\r\nsince the book had been published; he was glad to think he would never\r\nwrite anything of the same sort again. Who could have been reading it,\r\nhe wondered? Anne, perhaps; he liked to think so. Perhaps, too, she had\r\nat last recognised herself in the Hamadryad of the poplar sapling; the\r\nslim Hamadryad whose movements were like the swaying of a young tree in\r\nthe wind. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Woman who was a Tree\xe2\x80\x9d was what he had called the poem. He\r\nhad given her the book when it came out, hoping that the poem would tell\r\nher what he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dared to say. She had never referred to it.\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes and saw a vision of her in a red velvet cloak, swaying\r\ninto the little restaurant where they sometimes dined together in\r\nLondon--three quarters of an hour late, and he at his table, haggard\r\nwith anxiety, irritation, hunger. Oh, she was damnable!\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that perhaps his hostess might be in her boudoir. It\r\nwas a possibility; he would go and see. Mrs. Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir was in\r\nthe central tower on the garden front. A little staircase cork-screwed\r\nup to it from the hall. Denis mounted, tapped at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Ah, she was there; he had rather hoped she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. He opened the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nPriscilla Wimbush was lying on the sofa. A blotting-pad rested on her\r\nknees and she was thoughtfully sucking the end of a silver pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten you were coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here I am, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis deprecatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully\r\nsorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wimbush laughed. Her voice, her laughter, were deep and masculine.\r\nEverything about her was manly. She had a large, square, middle-aged\r\nface, with a massive projecting nose and little greenish eyes, the whole\r\nsurmounted by a lofty and elaborate coiffure of a curiously improbable\r\nshade of orange. Looking at her, Denis always thought of Wilkie Bard as\r\nthe cantatrice.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\n\r\n               Sing in op\xe2\x80\x99ra, sing in op\xe2\x80\x99ra,\r\n\r\n               Sing in op-pop-pop-pop-pop-popera.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToday she was wearing a purple silk dress with a high collar and a row\r\nof pearls. The costume, so richly dowagerish, so suggestive of the Royal\r\nFamily, made her look more than ever like something on the Halls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, and he hesitated, almost voluptuously. He had a\r\ntremendously amusing account of London and its doings all ripe and ready\r\nin his mind. It would be a pleasure to give it utterance. \xe2\x80\x9cTo begin\r\nwith,\xe2\x80\x9d he said...\r\n\r\nBut he was too late. Mrs. Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s question had been what the\r\ngrammarians call rhetorical; it asked for no answer. It was a little\r\nconversational flourish, a gambit in the polite game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find me busy at my horoscopes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without even being aware\r\nthat she had interrupted him.\r\n\r\nA little pained, Denis decided to reserve his story for more receptive\r\nears. He contented himself, by way of revenge, with saying \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d rather\r\nicily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I tell you how I won four hundred on the Grand National this year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, still frigid and mono-syllabic. She must have told\r\nhim at least six times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Everything is in the Stars. In the Old Days,\r\nbefore I had the Stars to help me, I used to lose thousands. Now\xe2\x80\x9d--she\r\npaused an instant--\xe2\x80\x9cwell, look at that four hundred on the Grand\r\nNational. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Stars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis would have liked to hear more about the Old Days. But he was too\r\ndiscreet and, still more, too shy to ask. There had been something of\r\na bust up; that was all he knew. Old Priscilla--not so old then, of\r\ncourse, and sprightlier--had lost a great deal of money, dropped it\r\nin handfuls and hatfuls on every race-course in the country. She had\r\ngambled too. The number of thousands varied in the different legends,\r\nbut all put it high. Henry Wimbush was forced to sell some of his\r\nPrimitives--a Taddeo da Poggibonsi, an Amico di Taddeo, and four or five\r\nnameless Sienese--to the Americans. There was a crisis. For the first\r\ntime in his life Henry asserted himself, and with good effect, it\r\nseemed.\r\n\r\nPriscilla\xe2\x80\x99s gay and gadding existence had come to an abrupt end.\r\nNowadays she spent almost all her time at Crome, cultivating a rather\r\nill-defined malady. For consolation she dallied with New Thought and the\r\nOccult. Her passion for racing still possessed her, and Henry, who was a\r\nkind-hearted fellow at bottom, allowed her forty pounds a month betting\r\nmoney. Most of Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s days were spent in casting the horoscopes\r\nof horses, and she invested her money scientifically, as the stars\r\ndictated. She betted on football too, and had a large notebook in which\r\nshe registered the horoscopes of all the players in all the teams of\r\nthe League. The process of balancing the horoscopes of two elevens one\r\nagainst the other was a very delicate and difficult one. A match between\r\nthe Spurs and the Villa entailed a conflict in the heavens so vast and\r\nso complicated that it was not to be wondered at if she sometimes made a\r\nmistake about the outcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a pity you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in these things, Denis, such a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mrs. Wimbush in her deep, distinct voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I feel it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have faith. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nno idea how amusing and exciting life becomes when you do believe. All\r\nthat happens means something; nothing you do is ever insignificant. It\r\nmakes life so jolly, you know. Here am I at Crome. Dull as ditchwater,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d think; but no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t find it so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret the Old Days\r\na bit. I have the Stars...\xe2\x80\x9d She picked up the sheet of paper that was\r\nlying on the blotting-pad. \xe2\x80\x9cInman\xe2\x80\x99s horoscope,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9c(I\r\nthought I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a little fling on the billiards championship\r\nthis autumn.) I have the Infinite to keep in tune with,\xe2\x80\x9d she waved her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then there\xe2\x80\x99s the next world and all the spirits, and one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nAura, and Mrs. Eddy and saying you\xe2\x80\x99re not ill, and the Christian\r\nMysteries and Mrs. Besant. It\xe2\x80\x99s all splendid. One\xe2\x80\x99s never dull for a\r\nmoment. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how I used to get on before--in the Old Days.\r\nPleasure--running about, that\xe2\x80\x99s all it was; just running about. Lunch,\r\ntea, dinner, theatre, supper every day. It was fun, of course, while it\r\nlasted. But there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much left of it afterwards. There\xe2\x80\x99s rather a\r\ngood thing about that in Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s new book. Where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat up and reached for a book that was lying on the little table by\r\nthe head of the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him, by the way?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barbecue-Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis knew of him vaguely. Barbecue-Smith was a name in the Sunday\r\npapers. He wrote about the Conduct of Life. He might even be the author\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a Young Girl Ought to Know\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not personally,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve invited him for next week-end.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned over the pages of the\r\nbook. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the passage I was thinking of. I marked it. I always mark\r\nthe things I like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolding the book almost at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, for she was somewhat\r\nlong-sighted, and making suitable gestures with her free hand, she began\r\nto read, slowly, dramatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What are thousand pound fur coats, what are quarter million incomes?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She looked up from the page with a histrionic movement of the head; her\r\norange coiffure nodded portentously. Denis looked at it, fascinated.\r\nWas it the Real Thing and henna, he wondered, or was it one of those\r\nComplete Transformations one sees in the advertisements?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What are Thrones and Sceptres?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe orange Transformation--yes, it must be a Transformation--bobbed up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What are the gaieties of the Rich, the splendours of the Powerful,\r\nwhat is the pride of the Great, what are the gaudy pleasures of High\r\nSociety?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice, which had risen in tone, questioningly, from sentence to\r\nsentence, dropped suddenly and boomed reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98They are nothing. Vanity, fluff, dandelion seed in the wind, thin\r\nvapours of fever. The things that matter happen in the heart.\r\nSeen things are sweet, but those unseen are a thousand times more\r\nsignificant. It is the unseen that counts in Life.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wimbush lowered the book. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nDenis preferred not to hazard an opinion, but uttered a non-committal\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine book this, a beautiful book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, as she\r\nlet the pages flick back, one by one, from under her thumb. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe passage about the Lotus Pool. He compares the Soul to a Lotus Pool,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d She held up the book again and read. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A Friend of mine has\r\na Lotus Pool in his garden. It lies in a little dell embowered with wild\r\nroses and eglantine, among which the nightingale pours forth its amorous\r\ndescant all the summer long. Within the pool the Lotuses blossom, and\r\nthe birds of the air come to drink and bathe themselves in its crystal\r\nwaters...\xe2\x80\x99 Ah, and that reminds me,\xe2\x80\x9d Priscilla exclaimed, shutting the\r\nbook with a clap and uttering her big profound laugh--\xe2\x80\x9cthat reminds me\r\nof the things that have been going on in our bathing-pool since you were\r\nhere last. We gave the village people leave to come and bathe here in\r\nthe evenings. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea of the things that happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward, speaking in a confidential whisper; every now and\r\nthen she uttered a deep gurgle of laughter. \xe2\x80\x9c...mixed bathing...saw them\r\nout of my window...sent for a pair of field-glasses to make sure...no\r\ndoubt of it...\xe2\x80\x9d The laughter broke out again. Denis laughed too.\r\nBarbecue-Smith was tossed on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time we went to see if tea\xe2\x80\x99s ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla. She hoisted\r\nherself up from the sofa and went swishing off across the room, striding\r\nbeneath the trailing silk. Denis followed her, faintly humming to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\n\r\n               Sing in op\xe2\x80\x99ra, sing in op\xe2\x80\x99ra,\r\n\r\n               Sing in op-pop-pop-pop-pop-popera.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the little twiddly bit of accompaniment at the end: \xe2\x80\x9cra-ra.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe terrace in front of the house was a long narrow strip of turf,\r\nbounded along its outer edge by a graceful stone balustrade. Two little\r\nsummer-houses of brick stood at either end. Below the house the ground\r\nsloped very steeply away, and the terrace was a remarkably high one;\r\nfrom the balusters to the sloping lawn beneath was a drop of thirty\r\nfeet. Seen from below, the high unbroken terrace wall, built like\r\nthe house itself of brick, had the almost menacing aspect of a\r\nfortification--a castle bastion, from whose parapet one looked out\r\nacross airy depths to distances level with the eye. Below, in the\r\nforeground, hedged in by solid masses of sculptured yew trees, lay the\r\nstone-brimmed swimming-pool. Beyond it stretched the park, with its\r\nmassive elms, its green expanses of grass, and, at the bottom of the\r\nvalley, the gleam of the narrow river. On the farther side of the stream\r\nthe land rose again in a long slope, chequered with cultivation. Looking\r\nup the valley, to the right, one saw a line of blue, far-off hills.\r\n\r\nThe tea-table had been planted in the shade of one of the little\r\nsummer-houses, and the rest of the party was already assembled about it\r\nwhen Denis and Priscilla made their appearance. Henry Wimbush had begun\r\nto pour out the tea. He was one of those ageless, unchanging men on the\r\nfarther side of fifty, who might be thirty, who might be anything. Denis\r\nhad known him almost as long as he could remember. In all those years\r\nhis pale, rather handsome face had never grown any older; it was\r\nlike the pale grey bowler hat which he always wore, winter and\r\nsummer--unageing, calm, serenely without expression.\r\n\r\nNext him, but separated from him and from the rest of the world by the\r\nalmost impenetrable barriers of her deafness, sat Jenny Mullion. She was\r\nperhaps thirty, had a tilted nose and a pink-and-white complexion, and\r\nwore her brown hair plaited and coiled in two lateral buns over her\r\nears. In the secret tower of her deafness she sat apart, looking down at\r\nthe world through sharply piercing eyes. What did she think of men and\r\nwomen and things? That was something that Denis had never been able to\r\ndiscover. In her enigmatic remoteness Jenny was a little disquieting.\r\nEven now some interior joke seemed to be amusing her, for she was\r\nsmiling to herself, and her brown eyes were like very bright round\r\nmarbles.\r\n\r\nOn his other side the serious, moonlike innocence of Mary Bracegirdle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface shone pink and childish. She was nearly twenty-three, but one\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have guessed it. Her short hair, clipped like a page\xe2\x80\x99s, hung in\r\na bell of elastic gold about her cheeks. She had large blue china eyes,\r\nwhose expression was one of ingenuous and often puzzled earnestness.\r\n\r\nNext to Mary a small gaunt man was sitting, rigid and erect in\r\nhis chair. In appearance Mr. Scogan was like one of those extinct\r\nbird-lizards of the Tertiary. His nose was beaked, his dark eye had the\r\nshining quickness of a robin\xe2\x80\x99s. But there was nothing soft or gracious\r\nor feathery about him. The skin of his wrinkled brown face had a dry and\r\nscaly look; his hands were the hands of a crocodile. His movements\r\nwere marked by the lizard\xe2\x80\x99s disconcertingly abrupt clockwork speed; his\r\nspeech was thin, fluty, and dry. Henry Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s school-fellow and exact\r\ncontemporary, Mr. Scogan looked far older and, at the same time, far\r\nmore youthfully alive than did that gentle aristocrat with the face like\r\na grey bowler.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan might look like an extinct saurian, but Gombauld was\r\naltogether and essentially human. In the old-fashioned natural histories\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x98thirties he might have figured in a steel engraving as a type of\r\nHomo Sapiens--an honour which at that time commonly fell to Lord\r\nByron. Indeed, with more hair and less collar, Gombauld would have\r\nbeen completely Byronic--more than Byronic, even, for Gombauld was of\r\nProvencal descent, a black-haired young corsair of thirty, with flashing\r\nteeth and luminous large dark eyes. Denis looked at him enviously. He\r\nwas jealous of his talent: if only he wrote verse as well as Gombauld\r\npainted pictures! Still more, at the moment, he envied Gombauld his\r\nlooks, his vitality, his easy confidence of manner. Was it surprising\r\nthat Anne should like him? Like him?--it might even be something worse,\r\nDenis reflected bitterly, as he walked at Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s side down the long\r\ngrass terrace.\r\n\r\nBetween Gombauld and Mr. Scogan a very much lowered deck-chair presented\r\nits back to the new arrivals as they advanced towards the tea-table.\r\nGombauld was leaning over it; his face moved vivaciously; he smiled, he\r\nlaughed, he made quick gestures with his hands. From the depths of the\r\nchair came up a sound of soft, lazy laughter. Denis started as he heard\r\nit. That laughter--how well he knew it! What emotions it evoked in him!\r\nHe quickened his pace.\r\n\r\nIn her low deck-chair Anne was nearer to lying than to sitting. Her\r\nlong, slender body reposed in an attitude of listless and indolent\r\ngrace. Within its setting of light brown hair her face had a pretty\r\nregularity that was almost doll-like. And indeed there were moments\r\nwhen she seemed nothing more than a doll; when the oval face, with its\r\nlong-lashed, pale blue eyes, expressed nothing; when it was no more than\r\na lazy mask of wax. She was Henry Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s own niece; that bowler-like\r\ncountenance was one of the Wimbush heirlooms; it ran in the family,\r\nappearing in its female members as a blank doll-face. But across this\r\ndollish mask, like a gay melody dancing over an unchanging fundamental\r\nbass, passed Anne\xe2\x80\x99s other inheritance--quick laughter, light ironic\r\namusement, and the changing expressions of many moods. She was smiling\r\nnow as Denis looked down at her: her cat\xe2\x80\x99s smile, he called it, for no\r\nvery good reason. The mouth was compressed, and on either side of it\r\ntwo tiny wrinkles had formed themselves in her cheeks. An infinity\r\nof slightly malicious amusement lurked in those little folds, in the\r\npuckers about the half-closed eyes, in the eyes themselves, bright and\r\nlaughing between the narrowed lids.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary greetings spoken, Denis found an empty chair between\r\nGombauld and Jenny and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Jenny?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to her.\r\n\r\nJenny nodded and smiled in mysterious silence, as though the subject of\r\nher health were a secret that could not be publicly divulged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s London been since I went away?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne inquired from the depth of\r\nher chair.\r\n\r\nThe moment had come; the tremendously amusing narrative was waiting for\r\nutterance. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, smiling happily, \xe2\x80\x9cto begin with...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Priscilla told you of our great antiquarian find?\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Wimbush\r\nleaned forward; the most promising of buds was nipped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo begin with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis desperately, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was the Ballet...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast week,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wimbush went on softly and implacably, \xe2\x80\x9cwe dug up fifty\r\nyards of oaken drain-pipes; just tree trunks with a hole bored through\r\nthe middle. Very interesting indeed. Whether they were laid down by the\r\nmonks in the fifteenth century, or whether...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis listened gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cExtraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when Mr. Wimbush had\r\nfinished; \xe2\x80\x9cquite extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d He helped himself to another slice\r\nof cake. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even want to tell his tale about London now; he was\r\ndamped.\r\n\r\nFor some time past Mary\xe2\x80\x99s grave blue eyes had been fixed upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave you been writing lately?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. It would be nice to have a\r\nlittle literary conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, verse and prose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis--\xe2\x80\x9cjust verse and prose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProse?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan pounced alarmingly on the word. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been writing\r\nprose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a novel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Denis!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis felt rather uncomfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, about the usual things, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll describe the plot for you. Little\r\nPercy, the hero, was never good at games, but he was always clever.\r\nHe passes through the usual public school and the usual university and\r\ncomes to London, where he lives among the artists. He is bowed down with\r\nmelancholy thought; he carries the whole weight of the universe upon\r\nhis shoulders. He writes a novel of dazzling brilliance; he dabbles\r\ndelicately in Amour and disappears, at the end of the book, into the\r\nluminous Future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis blushed scarlet. Mr. Scogan had described the plan of his novel\r\nwith an accuracy that was appalling. He made an effort to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nentirely wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy novel is not in the least like that.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nwas a heroic lie. Luckily, he reflected, only two chapters were written.\r\nHe would tear them up that very evening when he unpacked.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan paid no attention to his denial, but went on: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy will\r\nyou young men continue to write about things that are so entirely\r\nuninteresting as the mentality of adolescents and artists? Professional\r\nanthropologists might find it interesting to turn sometimes from the\r\nbeliefs of the Blackfellow to the philosophical preoccupations of the\r\nundergraduate. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect an ordinary adult man, like myself,\r\nto be much moved by the story of his spiritual troubles. And after all,\r\neven in England, even in Germany and Russia, there are more adults than\r\nadolescents. As for the artist, he is preoccupied with problems that\r\nare so utterly unlike those of the ordinary adult man--problems of pure\r\naesthetics which don\xe2\x80\x99t so much as present themselves to people like\r\nmyself--that a description of his mental processes is as boring to the\r\nordinary reader as a piece of pure mathematics. A serious book about\r\nartists regarded as artists is unreadable; and a book about artists\r\nregarded as lovers, husbands, dipsomaniacs, heroes, and the like is\r\nreally not worth writing again. Jean-Christophe is the stock artist of\r\nliterature, just as Professor Radium of \xe2\x80\x98Comic Cuts\xe2\x80\x99 is its stock man of\r\nscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear I\xe2\x80\x99m as uninteresting as all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gombauld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my dear Gombauld,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan hastened to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a\r\nlover or a dipsomaniac, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt of your being a most fascinating\r\nspecimen. But as a combiner of forms, you must honestly admit it, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na bore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entirely disagree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mary. She was somehow always\r\nout of breath when she talked. And her speech was punctuated by little\r\ngasps. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known a great many artists, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always found their\r\nmentality very interesting. Especially in Paris. Tschuplitski, for\r\nexample--I saw a great deal of Tschuplitski in Paris this spring...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but then you\xe2\x80\x99re an exception, Mary, you\xe2\x80\x99re an exception,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nScogan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a femme superieure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flush of pleasure turned Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face into a harvest moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDenis woke up next morning to find the sun shining, the sky serene. He\r\ndecided to wear white flannel trousers--white flannel trousers and a\r\nblack jacket, with a silk shirt and his new peach-coloured tie. And\r\nwhat shoes? White was the obvious choice, but there was something rather\r\npleasing about the notion of black patent leather. He lay in bed for\r\nseveral minutes considering the problem.\r\n\r\nBefore he went down--patent leather was his final choice--he looked at\r\nhimself critically in the glass. His hair might have been more golden,\r\nhe reflected. As it was, its yellowness had the hint of a greenish tinge\r\nin it. But his forehead was good. His forehead made up in height what\r\nhis chin lacked in prominence. His nose might have been longer, but it\r\nwould pass. His eyes might have been blue and not green. But his coat\r\nwas very well cut and, discreetly padded, made him seem robuster than\r\nhe actually was. His legs, in their white casing, were long and elegant.\r\nSatisfied, he descended the stairs. Most of the party had already\r\nfinished their breakfast. He found himself alone with Jenny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you slept well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it lovely?\xe2\x80\x9d Jenny replied, giving two rapid little nods.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we had such awful thunderstorms last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParallel straight lines, Denis reflected, meet only at infinity. He\r\nmight talk for ever of care-charmer sleep and she of meteorology till\r\nthe end of time. Did one ever establish contact with anyone? We are\r\nall parallel straight lines. Jenny was only a little more parallel than\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are very alarming, these thunderstorms,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, helping himself\r\nto porridge. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think so? Or are you above being frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I always go to bed in a storm. One is so much safer lying down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jenny, making a descriptive gesture, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause lightning\r\ngoes downwards and not flat ways. When you\xe2\x80\x99re lying down you\xe2\x80\x99re out of\r\nthe current.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very ingenious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Denis finished his porridge and helped himself\r\nto bacon. For lack of anything better to say, and because Mr. Scogan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsurd phrase was for some reason running in his head, he turned to\r\nJenny and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you consider yourself a femme superieure?\xe2\x80\x9d He had to repeat the\r\nquestion several times before Jenny got the hang of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rather indignantly, when at last she heard what Denis\r\nwas saying. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. Has anyone been suggesting that I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Scogan told Mary she was one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he?\xe2\x80\x9d Jenny lowered her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what I think of\r\nthat man? I think he\xe2\x80\x99s slightly sinister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving made this pronouncement, she entered the ivory tower of her\r\ndeafness and closed the door. Denis could not induce her to say anything\r\nmore, could not induce her even to listen. She just smiled at him,\r\nsmiled and occasionally nodded.\r\n\r\nDenis went out on to the terrace to smoke his after-breakfast pipe and\r\nto read his morning paper. An hour later, when Anne came down, she found\r\nhim still reading. By this time he had got to the Court Circular and\r\nthe Forthcoming Weddings. He got up to meet her as she approached, a\r\nHamadryad in white muslin, across the grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Denis,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look perfectly sweet in your white\r\ntrousers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis was dreadfully taken aback. There was no possible retort. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nspeak as though I were a child in a new frock,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a show of\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s how I feel about you, Denis dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I\xe2\x80\x99m so much older than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFour years older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you do look perfectly sweet in your white trousers, why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I say so? And why did you put them on, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nwere going to look sweet in them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go into the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. He was put out; the conversation\r\nhad taken such a preposterous and unexpected turn. He had planned a very\r\ndifferent opening, in which he was to lead off with, \xe2\x80\x9cYou look adorable\r\nthis morning,\xe2\x80\x9d or something of the kind, and she was to answer, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x9d and then there was to be a pregnant silence. And now she had got in\r\nfirst with the trousers. It was provoking; his pride was hurt.\r\n\r\nThat part of the garden that sloped down from the foot of the terrace\r\nto the pool had a beauty which did not depend on colour so much as on\r\nforms. It was as beautiful by moonlight as in the sun. The silver of\r\nwater, the dark shapes of yew and ilex trees remained, at all hours and\r\nseasons, the dominant features of the scene. It was a landscape in black\r\nand white. For colour there was the flower-garden; it lay to one side\r\nof the pool, separated from it by a huge Babylonian wall of yews. You\r\npassed through a tunnel in the hedge, you opened a wicket in a wall, and\r\nyou found yourself, startlingly and suddenly, in the world of colour.\r\nThe July borders blazed and flared under the sun. Within its high brick\r\nwalls the garden was like a great tank of warmth and perfume and colour.\r\n\r\nDenis held open the little iron gate for his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\npassing from a cloister into an Oriental palace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and took a\r\ndeep breath of the warm, flower-scented air. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In fragrant volleys they\r\nlet fly...\xe2\x80\x99 How does it go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well shot, ye firemen! Oh how sweet\r\n\r\n               And round your equal fires do meet;\r\n\r\n               Whose shrill report no ear can tell,\r\n\r\n               But echoes to the eye and smell...\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a bad habit of quoting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I never know the\r\ncontext or author, I find it humiliating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis apologized. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the fault of one\xe2\x80\x99s education. Things somehow\r\nseem more real and vivid when one can apply somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s ready-made\r\nphrase about them. And then there are lots of lovely names and\r\nwords--Monophysite, Iamblichus, Pomponazzi; you bring them out\r\ntriumphantly, and feel you\xe2\x80\x99ve clinched the argument with the mere\r\nmagical sound of them. That\xe2\x80\x99s what comes of the higher education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may regret your education,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of my lack of\r\nit. Look at those sunflowers! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they magnificent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark faces and golden crowns--they\xe2\x80\x99re kings of Ethiopia. And I like\r\nthe way the tits cling to the flowers and pick out the seeds, while the\r\nother loutish birds, grubbing dirtily for their food, look up in envy\r\nfrom the ground. Do they look up in envy? That\xe2\x80\x99s the literary touch, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid. Education again. It always comes back to that.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent.\r\n\r\nAnne had sat down on a bench that stood in the shade of an old apple\r\ntree. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m listening,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe did not sit down, but walked backwards and forwards in front of the\r\nbench, gesticulating a little as he talked. \xe2\x80\x9cBooks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said--\xe2\x80\x9cbooks.\r\nOne reads so many, and one sees so few people and so little of the\r\nworld. Great thick books about the universe and the mind and ethics.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea how many there are. I must have read twenty or thirty\r\ntons of them in the last five years. Twenty tons of ratiocination.\r\nWeighted with that, one\xe2\x80\x99s pushed out into the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on walking up and down. His voice rose, fell, was silent a\r\nmoment, and then talked on. He moved his hands, sometimes he waved his\r\narms. Anne looked and listened quietly, as though she were at a lecture.\r\nHe was a nice boy, and to-day he looked charming--charming!\r\n\r\nOne entered the world, Denis pursued, having ready-made ideas about\r\neverything. One had a philosophy and tried to make life fit into it.\r\nOne should have lived first and then made one\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy to fit\r\nlife...Life, facts, things were horribly complicated; ideas, even\r\nthe most difficult of them, deceptively simple. In the world of ideas\r\neverything was clear; in life all was obscure, embroiled. Was it\r\nsurprising that one was miserable, horribly unhappy? Denis came to\r\na halt in front of the bench, and as he asked this last question he\r\nstretched out his arms and stood for an instant in an attitude of\r\ncrucifixion, then let them fall again to his sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Denis!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne was touched. He was really too pathetic as he\r\nstood there in front of her in his white flannel trousers. \xe2\x80\x9cBut does one\r\nsuffer about these things? It seems very extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re like Scogan,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Denis bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou regard me as a specimen\r\nfor an anthropologist. Well, I suppose I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested, and drew in her skirt with a gesture that\r\nindicated that he was to sit down beside her. He sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou just take things for granted and as they come?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nmuch simpler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson to be learnt\r\ngradually. There are the twenty tons of ratiocination to be got rid of\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always taken things as they come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so\r\nobvious. One enjoys the pleasant things, avoids the nasty ones. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing more to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing--for you. But, then, you were born a pagan; I am trying\r\nlaboriously to make myself one. I can take nothing for granted, I can\r\nenjoy nothing as it comes along. Beauty, pleasure, art, women--I have\r\nto invent an excuse, a justification for everything that\xe2\x80\x99s delightful.\r\nOtherwise I can\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy it with an easy conscience. I make up a little\r\nstory about beauty and pretend that it has something to do with truth\r\nand goodness. I have to say that art is the process by which one\r\nreconstructs the divine reality out of chaos. Pleasure is one of the\r\nmystical roads to union with the infinite--the ecstasies of drinking,\r\ndancing, love-making. As for women, I am perpetually assuring myself\r\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99re the broad highway to divinity. And to think that I\xe2\x80\x99m only\r\njust beginning to see through the silliness of the whole thing! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nincredible to me that anyone should have escaped these horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still more incredible to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cthat anyone should have\r\nbeen a victim to them. I should like to see myself believing that men\r\nare the highway to divinity.\xe2\x80\x9d The amused malice of her smile planted two\r\nlittle folds on either side of her mouth, and through their half-closed\r\nlids her eyes shone with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you need, Denis, is a nice\r\nplump young wife, a fixed income, and a little congenial but regular\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I need is you.\xe2\x80\x9d That was what he ought to have retorted, that\r\nwas what he wanted passionately to say. He could not say it. His desire\r\nfought against his shyness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I need is you.\xe2\x80\x9d Mentally he shouted\r\nthe words, but not a sound issued from his lips. He looked at her\r\ndespairingly. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she see what was going on inside him? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe understand? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I need is you.\xe2\x80\x9d He would say it, he would--he\r\nwould.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall go and bathe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so hot.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nopportunity had passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMr. Wimbush had taken them to see the sights of the Home Farm, and now\r\nthey were standing, all six of them--Henry Wimbush, Mr. Scogan, Denis,\r\nGombauld, Anne, and Mary--by the low wall of the piggery, looking into\r\none of the styes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a good sow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had a litter of fourteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFourteen?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary echoed incredulously. She turned astonished blue eyes\r\ntowards Mr. Wimbush, then let them fall onto the seething mass of elan\r\nvital that fermented in the sty.\r\n\r\nAn immense sow reposed on her side in the middle of the pen. Her round,\r\nblack belly, fringed with a double line of dugs, presented itself to the\r\nassault of an army of small, brownish-black swine. With a frantic greed\r\nthey tugged at their mother\xe2\x80\x99s flank. The old sow stirred sometimes\r\nuneasily or uttered a little grunt of pain. One small pig, the runt,\r\nthe weakling of the litter, had been unable to secure a place at the\r\nbanquet. Squealing shrilly, he ran backwards and forwards, trying to\r\npush in among his stronger brothers or even to climb over their tight\r\nlittle black backs towards the maternal reservoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ARE fourteen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right. I counted. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sow next door,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wimbush went on, \xe2\x80\x9chas done very badly. She only\r\nhad five in her litter. I shall give her another chance. If she does no\r\nbetter next time, I shall fat her up and kill her. There\xe2\x80\x99s the boar,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he pointed towards a farther sty. \xe2\x80\x9cFine old beast, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? But he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting past his prime. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how practical, how eminently realistic!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this\r\nfarm we have a model of sound paternal government. Make them breed,\r\nmake them work, and when they\xe2\x80\x99re past working or breeding or begetting,\r\nslaughter them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarming seems to be mostly indecency and cruelty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\nWith the ferrule of his walking-stick Denis began to scratch the boar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlong bristly back. The animal moved a little so as to bring himself\r\nwithin easier range of the instrument that evoked in him such delicious\r\nsensations; then he stood stock still, softly grunting his contentment.\r\nThe mud of years flaked off his sides in a grey powdery scurf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pleasure it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, \xe2\x80\x9cto do somebody a kindness. I\r\nbelieve I enjoy scratching this pig quite as much as he enjoys being\r\nscratched. If only one could always be kind with so little expense or\r\ntrouble...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gate slammed; there was a sound of heavy footsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning, Rowley!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d old Rowley answered. He was the most venerable of\r\nthe labourers on the farm--a tall, solid man, still unbent, with grey\r\nside-whiskers and a steep, dignified profile. Grave, weighty in his\r\nmanner, splendidly respectable, Rowley had the air of a great English\r\nstatesman of the mid-nineteenth century. He halted on the outskirts of\r\nthe group, and for a moment they all looked at the pigs in a silence\r\nthat was only broken by the sound of grunting or the squelch of a sharp\r\nhoof in the mire. Rowley turned at last, slowly and ponderously and\r\nnobly, as he did everything, and addressed himself to Henry Wimbush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at them, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a motion of his hand towards the\r\nwallowing swine. \xe2\x80\x9cRightly is they called pigs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRightly indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wimbush agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am abashed by that man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, as old Rowley plodded off\r\nslowly and with dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat wisdom, what judgment, what a sense of\r\nvalues! \xe2\x80\x98Rightly are they called swine.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes. And I wish I could, with\r\nas much justice, say, \xe2\x80\x98Rightly are we called men.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on towards the cowsheds and the stables of the cart-horses.\r\nFive white geese, taking the air this fine morning, even as they were\r\ndoing, met them in the way. They hesitated, cackled; then, converting\r\ntheir lifted necks into rigid, horizontal snakes, they rushed off in\r\ndisorder, hissing horribly as they went. Red calves paddled in the dung\r\nand mud of a spacious yard. In another enclosure stood the bull,\r\nmassive as a locomotive. He was a very calm bull, and his face wore an\r\nexpression of melancholy stupidity. He gazed with reddish-brown eyes at\r\nhis visitors, chewed thoughtfully at the tangible memories of an earlier\r\nmeal, swallowed and regurgitated, chewed again. His tail lashed savagely\r\nfrom side to side; it seemed to have nothing to do with his impassive\r\nbulk. Between his short horns was a triangle of red curls, short and\r\ndense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid animal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush. \xe2\x80\x9cPedigree stock. But he\xe2\x80\x99s getting\r\na little old, like the boar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFat him up and slaughter him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan pronounced, with a delicate\r\nold-maidish precision of utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you give the animals a little holiday from producing\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for the poor things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wimbush shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI rather like seeing\r\nfourteen pigs grow where only one grew before. The spectacle of so much\r\ncrude life is refreshing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear you say so,\xe2\x80\x9d Gombauld broke in warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of life:\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what we want. I like pullulation; everything ought to increase\r\nand multiply as hard as it can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGombauld grew lyrical. Everybody ought to have children--Anne ought to\r\nhave them, Mary ought to have them--dozens and dozens. He emphasised his\r\npoint by thumping with his walking-stick on the bull\xe2\x80\x99s leather flanks.\r\nMr. Scogan ought to pass on his intelligence to little Scogans, and\r\nDenis to little Denises. The bull turned his head to see what was\r\nhappening, regarded the drumming stick for several seconds, then turned\r\nback again satisfied, it seemed, that nothing was happening. Sterility\r\nwas odious, unnatural, a sin against life. Life, life, and still more\r\nlife. The ribs of the placid bull resounded.\r\n\r\nStanding with his back against the farmyard pump, a little apart, Denis\r\nexamined the group. Gombauld, passionate and vivacious, was its centre.\r\nThe others stood round, listening--Henry Wimbush, calm and polite\r\nbeneath his grey bowler; Mary, with parted lips and eyes that shone with\r\nthe indignation of a convinced birth-controller. Anne looked on through\r\nhalf-shut eyes, smiling; and beside her stood Mr. Scogan, bolt upright\r\nin an attitude of metallic rigidity that contrasted strangely with that\r\nfluid grace of hers which even in stillness suggested a soft movement.\r\n\r\nGombauld ceased talking, and Mary, flushed and outraged, opened her\r\nmouth to refute him. But she was too slow. Before she could utter a\r\nword Mr. Scogan\xe2\x80\x99s fluty voice had pronounced the opening phrases of a\r\ndiscourse. There was no hope of getting so much as a word in edgeways;\r\nMary had perforce to resign herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven your eloquence, my dear Gombauld,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying--\xe2\x80\x9ceven your\r\neloquence must prove inadequate to reconvert the world to a belief in\r\nthe delights of mere multiplication. With the gramophone, the cinema,\r\nand the automatic pistol, the goddess of Applied Science has presented\r\nthe world with another gift, more precious even than these--the means of\r\ndissociating love from propagation. Eros, for those who wish it, is now\r\nan entirely free god; his deplorable associations with Lucina may be\r\nbroken at will. In the course of the next few centuries, who knows?\r\nthe world may see a more complete severance. I look forward to it\r\noptimistically. Where the great Erasmus Darwin and Miss Anna Seward,\r\nSwan of Lichfield, experimented--and, for all their scientific ardour,\r\nfailed--our descendants will experiment and succeed. An impersonal\r\ngeneration will take the place of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s hideous system. In vast state\r\nincubators, rows upon rows of gravid bottles will supply the world with\r\nthe population it requires. The family system will disappear; society,\r\nsapped at its very base, will have to find new foundations; and Eros,\r\nbeautifully and irresponsibly free, will flit like a gay butterfly from\r\nflower to flower through a sunlit world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe distant future always does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s china blue eyes, more serious and more astonished than ever,\r\nwere fixed on Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cBottles?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\r\nBottles...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith arrived in time for tea on Saturday afternoon. He was\r\na short and corpulent man, with a very large head and no neck. In his\r\nearlier middle age he had been distressed by this absence of neck,\r\nbut was comforted by reading in Balzac\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLouis Lambert\xe2\x80\x9d that all the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s great men have been marked by the same peculiarity, and for a\r\nsimple and obvious reason: Greatness is nothing more nor less than\r\nthe harmonious functioning of the faculties of the head and heart;\r\nthe shorter the neck, the more closely these two organs approach one\r\nanother; argal...It was convincing.\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith belonged to the old school of journalists. He sported\r\na leonine head with a greyish-black mane of oddly unappetising hair\r\nbrushed back from a broad but low forehead. And somehow he always seemed\r\nslightly, ever so slightly, soiled. In younger days he had gaily called\r\nhimself a Bohemian. He did so no longer. He was a teacher now, a kind\r\nof prophet. Some of his books of comfort and spiritual teaching were in\r\ntheir hundred and twentieth thousand.\r\n\r\nPriscilla received him with every mark of esteem. He had never been to\r\nCrome before; she showed him round the house. Mr. Barbecue-Smith was\r\nfull of admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo quaint, so old-world,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating. He had a rich, rather\r\nunctuous voice.\r\n\r\nPriscilla praised his latest book. \xe2\x80\x9cSplendid, I thought it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid in her large, jolly way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to think you found it a comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, tremendously! And the bit about the Lotus Pool--I thought that so\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would like that. It came to me, you know, from without.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwaved his hand to indicate the astral world.\r\n\r\nThey went out into the garden for tea. Mr. Barbecue-Smith was duly\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Stone is a writer too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, as she introduced Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barbecue-Smith smiled benignly, and, looking up at Denis\r\nwith an expression of Olympian condescension, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what sort of things\r\ndo you write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis was furious, and, to make matters worse, he felt himself blushing\r\nhotly. Had Priscilla no sense of proportion? She was putting them in the\r\nsame category--Barbecue-Smith and himself. They were both writers, they\r\nboth used pen and ink. To Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s question he answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing much, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d and looked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Stone is one of our younger poets.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s voice. He scowled\r\nat her, and she smiled back exasperatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent, excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith, and he squeezed Denis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm encouragingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bard\xe2\x80\x99s is a noble calling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as tea was over Mr. Barbecue-Smith excused himself; he had to\r\ndo some writing before dinner. Priscilla quite understood. The prophet\r\nretired to his chamber.\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith came down to the drawing-room at ten to eight. He was\r\nin a good humour, and, as he descended the stairs, he smiled to himself\r\nand rubbed his large white hands together. In the drawing-room someone\r\nwas playing softly and ramblingly on the piano. He wondered who it could\r\nbe. One of the young ladies, perhaps. But no, it was only Denis, who got\r\nup hurriedly and with some embarrassment as he came into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo go on, do go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very fond of\r\nmusic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly go on,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI only make noises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Mr. Barbecue-Smith stood with his back to the\r\nhearth, warming himself at the memory of last winter\xe2\x80\x99s fires. He could\r\nnot control his interior satisfaction, but still went on smiling to\r\nhimself. At last he turned to Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou write,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes--a little, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many words do you find you can write in an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever counted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you ought to, you ought to. It\xe2\x80\x99s most important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis exercised his memory. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m in good form,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI fancy\r\nI do a twelve-hundred-word review in about four hours. But sometimes it\r\ntakes me much longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, three hundred words an hour at your\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d He walked out into the middle of the room, turned round on his\r\nheels, and confronted Denis again. \xe2\x80\x9cGuess how many words I wrote this\r\nevening between five and half-past seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but you must guess. Between five and half-past seven--that\xe2\x80\x99s two\r\nand a half hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve hundred words,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis hazarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s expanded face shone with gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cTry\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. He found he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t summon up much interest\r\nin Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Three thousand eight hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis opened his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must get a lot done in a day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith suddenly became extremely confidential. He pulled up\r\na stool to the side of Denis\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair, sat down in it, and began to\r\ntalk softly and rapidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying his hand on Denis\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to\r\nmake your living by writing; you\xe2\x80\x99re young, you\xe2\x80\x99re inexperienced. Let me\r\ngive you a little sound advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was the fellow going to do? Denis wondered: give him an\r\nintroduction to the editor of \xe2\x80\x9cJohn o\xe2\x80\x99 London\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly\xe2\x80\x9d, or tell him\r\nwhere he could sell a light middle for seven guineas? Mr. Barbecue-Smith\r\npatted his arm several times and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret of writing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, breathing it into the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near--\xe2\x80\x9cthe secret of writing is Inspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis looked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInspiration...\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barbecue-Smith repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the native wood-note business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then I entirely agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what if one\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t got Inspiration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was precisely the question I was waiting for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBarbecue-Smith. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me what one should do if one hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nInspiration. I answer: you have Inspiration; everyone has Inspiration.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s simply a question of getting it to function.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clock struck eight. There was no sign of any of the other guests;\r\neverybody was always late at Crome. Mr. Barbecue-Smith went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my secret,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI give it you freely.\xe2\x80\x9d (Denis made a\r\nsuitably grateful murmur and grimace.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you to find your\r\nInspiration, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see a nice, steady young man like\r\nyou exhausting his vitality and wasting the best years of his life in\r\na grinding intellectual labour that could be completely obviated by\r\nInspiration. I did it myself, so I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like. Up till the\r\ntime I was thirty-eight I was a writer like you--a writer without\r\nInspiration. All I wrote I squeezed out of myself by sheer hard work.\r\nWhy, in those days I was never able to do more than six-fifty words an\r\nhour, and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I often didn\xe2\x80\x99t sell what I wrote.\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe artists,\xe2\x80\x9d he said parenthetically, \xe2\x80\x9cwe intellectuals aren\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nappreciated here in England.\xe2\x80\x9d Denis wondered if there was any method,\r\nconsistent, of course, with politeness, by which he could dissociate\r\nhimself from Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwe.\xe2\x80\x9d There was none; and besides,\r\nit was too late now, for Mr. Barbecue-Smith was once more pursuing the\r\ntenor of his discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt thirty-eight I was a poor, struggling, tired, overworked, unknown\r\njournalist. Now, at fifty...\xe2\x80\x9d He paused modestly and made a little\r\ngesture, moving his fat hands outwards, away from one another, and\r\nexpanding his fingers as though in demonstration. He was exhibiting\r\nhimself. Denis thought of that advertisement of Nestle\xe2\x80\x99s milk--the two\r\ncats on the wall, under the moon, one black and thin, the other white,\r\nsleek, and fat. Before Inspiration and after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInspiration has made the difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith solemnly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came quite suddenly--like a gentle dew from heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d He lifted his\r\nhand and let it fall back on to his knee to indicate the descent of the\r\ndew. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was one evening. I was writing my first little book about the\r\nConduct of Life--\xe2\x80\x98Humble Heroisms\xe2\x80\x99. You may have read it; it has been\r\na comfort--at least I hope and think so--a comfort to many thousands.\r\nI was in the middle of the second chapter, and I was stuck. Fatigue,\r\noverwork--I had only written a hundred words in the last hour, and I\r\ncould get no further. I sat biting the end of my pen and looking at the\r\nelectric light, which hung above my table, a little above and in front\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x9d He indicated the position of the lamp with elaborate care. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou ever looked at a bright light intently for a long time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nturning to Denis. Denis didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he had. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can hypnotise yourself\r\nthat way,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barbecue-Smith went on.\r\n\r\nThe gong sounded in a terrific crescendo from the hall. Still no sign of\r\nthe others. Denis was horribly hungry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what happened to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nhypnotised. I lost consciousness like that.\xe2\x80\x9d He snapped his fingers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I came to, I found that it was past midnight, and I had written\r\nfour thousand words. Four thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, opening his mouth very\r\nwide on the \xe2\x80\x9cou\xe2\x80\x9d of thousand. \xe2\x80\x9cInspiration had come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a very extraordinary thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid of it at first. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me natural. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel, somehow, that it was quite right, quite fair, I might almost say,\r\nto produce a literary composition unconsciously. Besides, I was afraid I\r\nmight have written nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd had you written nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d Denis asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barbecue-Smith replied, with a trace of annoyance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. It was admirable. Just a few spelling mistakes and\r\nslips, such as there generally are in automatic writing. But the style,\r\nthe thought--all the essentials were admirable. After that, Inspiration\r\ncame to me regularly. I wrote the whole of \xe2\x80\x98Humble Heroisms\xe2\x80\x99 like that.\r\nIt was a great success, and so has everything been that I have written\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned forward and jabbed at Denis with his finger. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy secret,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s how you could write too, if you\r\ntried--without effort, fluently, well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Denis, trying not to show how deeply he had been\r\ninsulted by that final \xe2\x80\x9cwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy cultivating your Inspiration, by getting into touch with your\r\nSubconscious. Have you ever read my little book, \xe2\x80\x98Pipe-Lines to the\r\nInfinite\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis had to confess that that was, precisely, one of the few, perhaps\r\nthe only one, of Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s works he had not read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a little\r\nbook about the connection of the Subconscious with the Infinite. Get\r\ninto touch with the Subconscious and you are in touch with the Universe.\r\nInspiration, in fact. You follow me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you find that the\r\nUniverse sometimes sends you very irrelevant messages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t allow it to,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barbecue-Smith replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI canalise it. I\r\nbring it down through pipes to work the turbines of my conscious mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike Niagara,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis suggested. Some of Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s remarks\r\nsounded strangely like quotations--quotations from his own works, no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. Like Niagara. And this is how I do it.\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned forward,\r\nand with a raised forefinger marked his points as he made them, beating\r\ntime, as it were, to his discourse. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I go off into my trance, I\r\nconcentrate on the subject I wish to be inspired about. Let us say I am\r\nwriting about the humble heroisms; for ten minutes before I go into the\r\ntrance I think of nothing but orphans supporting their little brothers\r\nand sisters, of dull work well and patiently done, and I focus my mind\r\non such great philosophical truths as the purification and uplifting of\r\nthe soul by suffering, and the alchemical transformation of leaden evil\r\ninto golden good.\xe2\x80\x9d (Denis again hung up his little festoon of quotation\r\nmarks.) \xe2\x80\x9cThen I pop off. Two or three hours later I wake up again, and\r\nfind that inspiration has done its work. Thousands of words, comforting,\r\nuplifting words, lie before me. I type them out neatly on my machine and\r\nthey are ready for the printer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all sounds wonderfully simple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is. All the great and splendid and divine things of life are\r\nwonderfully simple.\xe2\x80\x9d (Quotation marks again.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have to do my\r\naphorisms,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barbecue-Smith continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI prelude my trance by\r\nturning over the pages of any Dictionary of Quotations or Shakespeare\r\nCalendar that comes to hand. That sets the key, so to speak; that\r\nensures that the Universe shall come flowing in, not in a continuous\r\nrush, but in aphorismic drops. You see the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis nodded. Mr. Barbecue-Smith put his hand in his pocket and pulled\r\nout a notebook. \xe2\x80\x9cI did a few in the train to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning over\r\nthe pages. \xe2\x80\x9cJust dropped off into a trance in the corner of my carriage.\r\nI find the train very conducive to good work. Here they are.\xe2\x80\x9d He cleared\r\nhis throat and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mountain Road may be steep, but the air is pure up there, and it is\r\nfrom the Summit that one gets the view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Things that Really Matter happen in the Heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was curious, Denis reflected, the way the Infinite sometimes repeated\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing is Believing. Yes, but Believing is also Seeing. If I believe in\r\nGod, I see God, even in the things that seem to be evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith looked up from his notebook. \xe2\x80\x9cThat last one,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cis particularly subtle and beautiful, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? Without\r\nInspiration I could never have hit on that.\xe2\x80\x9d He re-read the apophthegm\r\nwith a slower and more solemn utterance. \xe2\x80\x9cStraight from the Infinite,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he commented reflectively, then addressed himself to the next aphorism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe flame of a candle gives Light, but it also Burns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPuzzled wrinkles appeared on Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexactly know what that means,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very gnomic. One could\r\napply it, of course to the Higher Education--illuminating, but provoking\r\nthe Lower Classes to discontent and revolution. Yes, I suppose\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. But it\xe2\x80\x99s gnomic, it\xe2\x80\x99s gnomic.\xe2\x80\x9d He rubbed his\r\nchin thoughtfully. The gong sounded again, clamorously, it seemed\r\nimploringly: dinner was growing cold. It roused Mr. Barbecue-Smith from\r\nmeditation. He turned to Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand me now when I advise you to cultivate your Inspiration.\r\nLet your Subconscious work for you; turn on the Niagara of the\r\nInfinite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of feet on the stairs. Mr. Barbecue-Smith got up,\r\nlaid his hand for an instant on Denis\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more now. Another time. And remember, I rely absolutely on your\r\ndiscretion in this matter. There are intimate, sacred things that one\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be generally known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAt Crome all the beds were ancient hereditary pieces of furniture. Huge\r\nbeds, like four-masted ships, with furled sails of shining coloured\r\nstuff. Beds carved and inlaid, beds painted and gilded. Beds of walnut\r\nand oak, of rare exotic woods. Beds of every date and fashion from the\r\ntime of Sir Ferdinando, who built the house, to the time of his namesake\r\nin the late eighteenth century, the last of the family, but all of them\r\ngrandiose, magnificent.\r\n\r\nThe finest of all was now Anne\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Sir Julius, son to Sir Ferdinando,\r\nhad had it made in Venice against his wife\xe2\x80\x99s first lying-in. Early\r\nseicento Venice had expended all its extravagant art in the making of\r\nit. The body of the bed was like a great square sarcophagus. Clustering\r\nroses were carved in high relief on its wooden panels, and luscious\r\nputti wallowed among the roses. On the black ground-work of the panels\r\nthe carved reliefs were gilded and burnished. The golden roses twined in\r\nspirals up the four pillar-like posts, and cherubs, seated at the top\r\nof each column, supported a wooden canopy fretted with the same carved\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nAnne was reading in bed. Two candles stood on the little table beside\r\nher, in their rich light her face, her bare arm and shoulder took on\r\nwarm hues and a sort of peach-like quality of surface. Here and there in\r\nthe canopy above her carved golden petals shone brightly among profound\r\nshadows, and the soft light, falling on the sculptured panel of the bed,\r\nbroke restlessly among the intricate roses, lingered in a broad caress\r\non the blown cheeks, the dimpled bellies, the tight, absurd little\r\nposteriors of the sprawling putti.\r\n\r\nThere was a discreet tap at the door. She looked up. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n A face, round and childish, within its sleek bell of golden hair, peered\r\nround the opening door. More childish-looking still, a suit of mauve\r\npyjamas made its entrance.\r\n\r\nIt was Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just look in for a moment to say\r\ngood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and sat down on the edge of the bed.\r\n\r\nAnne closed her book. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was very sweet of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you reading?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at the book. \xe2\x80\x9cRather second-rate,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d The tone in which Mary pronounced the word \xe2\x80\x9csecond-rate\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n implied an almost infinite denigration. She was accustomed in London to\r\nassociate only with first-rate people who liked first-rate things, and\r\nshe knew that there were very, very few first-rate things in the world,\r\nand that those were mostly French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. There was nothing more to be\r\nsaid. The silence that followed was a rather uncomfortable one. Mary\r\nfiddled uneasily with the bottom button of her pyjama jacket. Leaning\r\nback on her mound of heaped-up pillows, Anne waited and wondered what\r\nwas coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so awfully afraid of repressions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary at last, bursting\r\nsuddenly and surprisingly into speech. She pronounced the words on\r\nthe tail-end of an expiring breath, and had to gasp for new air almost\r\nbefore the phrase was finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s there to be depressed about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said repressions, not depressions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, repressions; I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cBut repressions of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe natural instincts of sex...\xe2\x80\x9d she began\r\ndidactically. But Anne cut her short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Perfectly. I understand. Repressions! old maids and all the\r\nrest. But what about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of them. It\xe2\x80\x99s always dangerous\r\nto repress one\xe2\x80\x99s instincts. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to detect in myself symptoms\r\nlike the ones you read of in the books. I constantly dream that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nfalling down wells; and sometimes I even dream that I\xe2\x80\x99m climbing up\r\nladders. It\xe2\x80\x99s most disquieting. The symptoms are only too clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne may become a nymphomaniac if one\xe2\x80\x99s not careful. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea how\r\nserious these repressions are if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of them in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds too awful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that I can do\r\nanything to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to talk it over with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course; I\xe2\x80\x99m only too happy, Mary darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary coughed and drew a deep breath. \xe2\x80\x9cI presume,\xe2\x80\x9d she began\r\nsententiously, \xe2\x80\x9cI presume we may take for granted that an intelligent\r\nyoung woman of twenty-three who has lived in civilised society in the\r\ntwentieth century has no prejudices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I confess I still have a few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not about repressions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not many about repressions; that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, rather, about getting rid of repressions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much for our fundamental postulate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. Solemnity was\r\nexpressed in every feature of her round young face, radiated from\r\nher large blue eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe come next to the desirability of possessing\r\nexperience. I hope we are agreed that knowledge is desirable and that\r\nignorance is undesirable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObedient as one of those complaisant disciples from whom Socrates could\r\nget whatever answer he chose, Anne gave her assent to this proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are equally agreed, I hope, that marriage is what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd repressions being what they are...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere would therefore seem to be only one conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I knew that,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s been proved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must do things\r\nlogically. The question is now...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where does the question come in? You\xe2\x80\x99ve reached your only possible\r\nconclusion--logically, which is more than I could have done. All that\r\nremains is to impart the information to someone you like--someone you\r\nlike really rather a lot, someone you\xe2\x80\x99re in love with, if I may express\r\nmyself so baldly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just where the question comes in,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nin love with anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if I were you, I should wait till you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t go on dreaming night after night that I\xe2\x80\x99m falling down a\r\nwell. It\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it really is TOO dangerous, then of course you must do\r\nsomething about it; you must find somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who?\xe2\x80\x9d A thoughtful frown puckered Mary\xe2\x80\x99s brow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be somebody\r\nintelligent, somebody with intellectual interests that I can share.\r\nAnd it must be somebody with a proper respect for women, somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprepared to talk seriously about his work and his ideas and about my\r\nwork and my ideas. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t, as you see, at all easy to find the right\r\nperson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are three unattached and intelligent men in\r\nthe house at the present time. There\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Scogan, to begin with;\r\nbut perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s rather too much of a genuine antique. And there are\r\nGombauld and Denis. Shall we say that the choice is limited to the last\r\ntwo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then hesitated, with\r\na certain air of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wondering,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, with a gasp, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether they really were\r\nunattached. I thought that perhaps you might...you might...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very nice of you to think of me, Mary darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne,\r\nsmiling the tight cat\xe2\x80\x99s smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, they are\r\nboth entirely unattached.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, looking relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are now\r\nconfronted with the question: Which of the two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can give no advice. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter for your taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of my taste,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary pronounced, \xe2\x80\x9cbut of their merits.\r\nWe must weigh them and consider them carefully and dispassionately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must do the weighing yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne; there was still the\r\ntrace of a smile at the corners of her mouth and round the half-closed\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t run the risk of advising you wrongly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGombauld has more talent,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary began, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is less civilised than\r\nDenis.\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\xe2\x80\x99s pronunciation of \xe2\x80\x9ccivilised\xe2\x80\x9d gave the word a special and\r\nadditional significance. She uttered it meticulously, in the very front\r\nof her mouth, hissing delicately on the opening sibilant. So few people\r\nwere civilised, and they, like the first-rate works of art, were mostly\r\nFrench. \xe2\x80\x9cCivilisation is most important, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne held up her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t advise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must make the\r\ndecision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGombauld\xe2\x80\x99s family,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary went on reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9ccomes from Marseilles.\r\nRather a dangerous heredity, when one thinks of the Latin attitude\r\ntowards women. But then, I sometimes wonder whether Denis is altogether\r\nserious-minded, whether he isn\xe2\x80\x99t rather a dilettante. It\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\ndifficult. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not listening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to take any responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I had better go to bed and think\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarefully and dispassionately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\nAt the door Mary turned round. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and wondered\r\nas she said the words why Anne was smiling in that curious way. It\r\nwas probably nothing, she reflected. Anne often smiled for no apparent\r\nreason; it was probably just a habit. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shan\xe2\x80\x99t dream of falling\r\ndown wells again to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadders are worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\nMary nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ladders are much graver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBreakfast on Sunday morning was an hour later than on week-days, and\r\nPriscilla, who usually made no public appearance before luncheon,\r\nhonoured it by her presence. Dressed in black silk, with a ruby cross as\r\nwell as her customary string of pearls round her neck, she presided.\r\nAn enormous Sunday paper concealed all but the extreme pinnacle of her\r\ncoiffure from the outer world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see Surrey has won,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her mouth full, \xe2\x80\x9cby four wickets.\r\nThe sun is in Leo: that would account for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid game, cricket,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Barbecue-Smith heartily to no one\r\nin particular; \xe2\x80\x9cso thoroughly English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJenny, who was sitting next to him, woke up suddenly with a start.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo English,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Barbecue-Smith.\r\n\r\nJenny looked at him, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish? Of course I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to explain, when Mrs. Wimbush vailed her Sunday paper,\r\nand appeared, a square, mauve-powdered face in the midst of orange\r\nsplendours. \xe2\x80\x9cI see there\xe2\x80\x99s a new series of articles on the next world\r\njust beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mr. Barbecue-Smith. \xe2\x80\x9cThis one\xe2\x80\x99s called\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Summer Land and Gehenna.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSummer Land,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mr. Barbecue-Smith, closing his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cSummer\r\nLand. A beautiful name. Beautiful--beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had taken the seat next to Denis\xe2\x80\x99s. After a night of careful\r\nconsideration she had decided on Denis. He might have less talent than\r\nGombauld, he might be a little lacking in seriousness, but somehow he\r\nwas safer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you writing much poetry here in the country?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a\r\nbright gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis curtly. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought my typewriter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you mean to say you can\xe2\x80\x99t write without a typewriter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis shook his head. He hated talking at breakfast, and, besides, he\r\nwanted to hear what Mr. Scogan was saying at the other end of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c...My scheme for dealing with the Church,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nbeautifully simple. At the present time the Anglican clergy wear their\r\ncollars the wrong way round. I would compel them to wear, not only their\r\ncollars, but all their clothes, turned back to frantic--coat, waistcoat,\r\ntrousers, boots--so that every clergyman should present to the world\r\na smooth facade, unbroken by stud, button, or lace. The enforcement of\r\nsuch a livery would act as a wholesome deterrent to those intending to\r\nenter the Church. At the same time it would enormously enhance, what\r\nArchbishop Laud so rightly insisted on, the \xe2\x80\x98beauty of holiness\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nfew incorrigibles who could not be deterred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn hell, it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, reading in her Sunday paper, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nchildren amuse themselves by flaying lambs alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but, dear lady, that\xe2\x80\x99s only a symbol,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr.\r\nBarbecue-Smith, \xe2\x80\x9ca material symbol of a h-piritual truth. Lambs\r\nsignify...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there are military uniforms,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen scarlet\r\nand pipe-clay were abandoned for khaki, there were some who trembled for\r\nthe future of war. But then, finding how elegant the new tunic was, how\r\nclosely it clipped the waist, how voluptuously, with the lateral\r\nbustles of the pockets, it exaggerated the hips; when they realized the\r\nbrilliant potentialities of breeches and top-boots, they were reassured.\r\nAbolish these military elegances, standardise a uniform of sack-cloth\r\nand mackintosh, you will very soon find that...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs anyone coming to church with me this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Henry Wimbush.\r\nNo one responded. He baited his bare invitation. \xe2\x80\x9cI read the lessons,\r\nyou know. And there\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Bodiham. His sermons are sometimes worth\r\nhearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. \xe2\x80\x9cI for one prefer to\r\nworship in the infinite church of Nature. How does our Shakespeare put\r\nit? \xe2\x80\x98Sermons in books, stones in the running brooks.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He waved his arm\r\nin a fine gesture towards the window, and even as he did so he became\r\nvaguely, but none the less insistently, none the less uncomfortably\r\naware that something had gone wrong with the quotation. Something--what\r\ncould it be? Sermons? Stones? Books?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMr. Bodiham was sitting in his study at the Rectory. The\r\nnineteenth-century Gothic windows, narrow and pointed, admitted the\r\nlight grudgingly; in spite of the brilliant July weather, the room was\r\nsombre. Brown varnished bookshelves lined the walls, filled with row\r\nupon row of those thick, heavy theological works which the second-hand\r\nbooksellers generally sell by weight. The mantelpiece, the over-mantel,\r\na towering structure of spindly pillars and little shelves, were brown\r\nand varnished. The writing-desk was brown and varnished. So were the\r\nchairs, so was the door. A dark red-brown carpet with patterns covered\r\nthe floor. Everything was brown in the room, and there was a curious\r\nbrownish smell.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this brown gloom Mr. Bodiham sat at his desk. He was the\r\nman in the Iron Mask. A grey metallic face with iron cheek-bones and a\r\nnarrow iron brow; iron folds, hard and unchanging, ran perpendicularly\r\ndown his cheeks; his nose was the iron beak of some thin, delicate bird\r\nof rapine. He had brown eyes, set in sockets rimmed with iron; round\r\nthem the skin was dark, as though it had been charred. Dense wiry hair\r\ncovered his skull; it had been black, it was turning grey. His ears\r\nwere very small and fine. His jaws, his chin, his upper lip were dark,\r\niron-dark, where he had shaved. His voice, when he spoke and especially\r\nwhen he raised it in preaching, was harsh, like the grating of iron\r\nhinges when a seldom-used door is opened.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly half-past twelve. He had just come back from church,\r\nhoarse and weary with preaching. He preached with fury, with passion,\r\nan iron man beating with a flail upon the souls of his congregation.\r\nBut the souls of the faithful at Crome were made of india-rubber, solid\r\nrubber; the flail rebounded. They were used to Mr. Bodiham at Crome. The\r\nflail thumped on india-rubber, and as often as not the rubber slept.\r\n\r\nThat morning he had preached, as he had often preached before, on the\r\nnature of God. He had tried to make them understand about God, what\r\na fearful thing it was to fall into His hands. God--they thought of\r\nsomething soft and merciful. They blinded themselves to facts; still\r\nmore, they blinded themselves to the Bible. The passengers on the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTitanic\xe2\x80\x9d sang \xe2\x80\x9cNearer my God to Thee\xe2\x80\x9d as the ship was going down. Did\r\nthey realise what they were asking to be brought nearer to? A white fire\r\nof righteousness, an angry fire...\r\n\r\nWhen Savonarola preached, men sobbed and groaned aloud. Nothing broke\r\nthe polite silence with which Crome listened to Mr. Bodiham--only an\r\noccasional cough and sometimes the sound of heavy breathing. In the\r\nfront pew sat Henry Wimbush, calm, well-bred, beautifully dressed. There\r\nwere times when Mr. Bodiham wanted to jump down from the pulpit and\r\nshake him into life,--times when he would have liked to beat and kill\r\nhis whole congregation.\r\n\r\nHe sat at his desk dejectedly. Outside the Gothic windows the earth was\r\nwarm and marvellously calm. Everything was as it had always been. And\r\nyet, and yet...It was nearly four years now since he had preached that\r\nsermon on Matthew xxiv. 7: \xe2\x80\x9cFor nation shall rise up against nation, and\r\nkingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences,\r\nand earthquakes, in divers places.\xe2\x80\x9d It was nearly four years. He had had\r\nthe sermon printed; it was so terribly, so vitally important that all\r\nthe world should know what he had to say. A copy of the little pamphlet\r\nlay on his desk--eight small grey pages, printed by a fount of type that\r\nhad grown blunt, like an old dog\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, by the endless champing and\r\nchamping of the press. He opened it and began to read it yet once again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:\r\nand there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers\r\nplaces.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNineteen centuries have elapsed since Our Lord gave utterance to those\r\nwords, and not a single one of them has been without wars, plagues,\r\nfamines, and earthquakes. Mighty empires have crashed in ruin to the\r\nground, diseases have unpeopled half the globe, there have been vast\r\nnatural cataclysms in which thousands have been overwhelmed by flood\r\nand fire and whirlwind. Time and again, in the course of these nineteen\r\ncenturies, such things have happened, but they have not brought Christ\r\nback to earth. They were \xe2\x80\x98signs of the times\xe2\x80\x99 inasmuch as they were\r\nsigns of God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath against the chronic wickedness of mankind, but they\r\nwere not signs of the times in connection with the Second Coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf earnest Christians have regarded the present war as a true sign of\r\nthe Lord\xe2\x80\x99s approaching return, it is not merely because it happens to\r\nbe a great war involving the lives of millions of people, not merely\r\nbecause famine is tightening its grip on every country in Europe, not\r\nmerely because disease of every kind, from syphilis to spotted fever, is\r\nrife among the warring nations; no, it is not for these reasons that we\r\nregard this war as a true Sign of the Times, but because in its origin\r\nand its progress it is marked by certain characteristics which seem\r\nto connect it almost beyond a doubt with the predictions in Christian\r\nProphecy relating to the Second Coming of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me enumerate the features of the present war which most clearly\r\nsuggest that it is a Sign foretelling the near approach of the Second\r\nAdvent. Our Lord said that \xe2\x80\x98this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached\r\nin all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x99 Although it would be presumptuous for us to say what degree of\r\nevangelisation will be regarded by God as sufficient, we may at least\r\nconfidently hope that a century of unflagging missionary work has\r\nbrought the fulfilment of this condition at any rate near. True, the\r\nlarger number of the world\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants have remained deaf to the\r\npreaching of the true religion; but that does not vitiate the fact that\r\nthe Gospel HAS been preached \xe2\x80\x98for a witness\xe2\x80\x99 to all unbelievers from the\r\nPapist to the Zulu. The responsibility for the continued prevalence of\r\nunbelief lies, not with the preachers, but with those preached to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain, it has been generally recognised that \xe2\x80\x98the drying up of the\r\nwaters of the great river Euphrates,\xe2\x80\x99 mentioned in the sixteenth chapter\r\nof Revelation, refers to the decay and extinction of Turkish power, and\r\nis a sign of the near approaching end of the world as we know it. The\r\ncapture of Jerusalem and the successes in Mesopotamia are great strides\r\nforward in the destruction of the Ottoman Empire; though it must be\r\nadmitted that the Gallipoli episode proved that the Turk still possesses\r\na \xe2\x80\x98notable horn\xe2\x80\x99 of strength. Historically speaking, this drying up of\r\nOttoman power has been going on for the past century; the last two years\r\nhave witnessed a great acceleration of the process, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that complete desiccation is within sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClosely following on the words concerning the drying up of Euphrates\r\ncomes the prophecy of Armageddon, that world war with which the Second\r\nComing is to be so closely associated. Once begun, the world war can\r\nend only with the return of Christ, and His coming will be sudden and\r\nunexpected, like that of a thief in the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us examine the facts. In history, exactly as in St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Gospel,\r\nthe world war is immediately preceded by the drying up of Euphrates, or\r\nthe decay of Turkish power. This fact alone would be enough to connect\r\nthe present conflict with the Armageddon of Revelation and therefore to\r\npoint to the near approach of the Second Advent. But further evidence of\r\nan even more solid and convincing nature can be adduced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmageddon is brought about by the activities of three unclean spirits,\r\nas it were toads, which come out of the mouths of the Dragon, the Beast,\r\nand the False Prophet. If we can identify these three powers of evil\r\nmuch light will clearly be thrown on the whole question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet can all be identified in\r\nhistory. Satan, who can only work through human agency, has used these\r\nthree powers in the long war against Christ which has filled the last\r\nnineteen centuries with religious strife. The Dragon, it has been\r\nsufficiently established, is pagan Rome, and the spirit issuing from its\r\nmouth is the spirit of Infidelity. The Beast, alternatively symbolised\r\nas a Woman, is undoubtedly the Papal power, and Popery is the spirit\r\nwhich it spews forth. There is only one power which answers to the\r\ndescription of the False Prophet, the wolf in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s clothing, the\r\nagent of the devil working in the guise of the Lamb, and that power is\r\nthe so-called \xe2\x80\x98Society of Jesus.\xe2\x80\x99 The spirit that issues from the mouth\r\nof the False Prophet is the spirit of False Morality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may assume, then, that the three evil spirits are Infidelity,\r\nPopery, and False Morality. Have these three influences been the real\r\ncause of the present conflict? The answer is clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spirit of Infidelity is the very spirit of German criticism. The\r\nHigher Criticism, as it is mockingly called, denies the possibility of\r\nmiracles, prediction, and real inspiration, and attempts to account for\r\nthe Bible as a natural development. Slowly but surely, during the last\r\neighty years, the spirit of Infidelity has been robbing the Germans\r\nof their Bible and their faith, so that Germany is to-day a nation of\r\nunbelievers. Higher Criticism has thus made the war possible; for it\r\nwould be absolutely impossible for any Christian nation to wage war as\r\nGermany is waging it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe come next to the spirit of Popery, whose influence in causing the\r\nwar was quite as great as that of Infidelity, though not, perhaps, so\r\nimmediately obvious. Since the Franco-Prussian War the Papal power has\r\nsteadily declined in France, while in Germany it has steadily increased.\r\nTo-day France is an anti-papal state, while Germany possesses a powerful\r\nRoman Catholic minority. Two papally controlled states, Germany and\r\nAustria, are at war with six anti-papal states--England, France, Italy,\r\nRussia, Serbia, and Portugal. Belgium is, of course, a thoroughly papal\r\nstate, and there can be little doubt that the presence on the Allies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nside of an element so essentially hostile has done much to hamper the\r\nrighteous cause and is responsible for our comparative ill-success. That\r\nthe spirit of Popery is behind the war is thus seen clearly enough in\r\nthe grouping of the opposed powers, while the rebellion in the Roman\r\nCatholic parts of Ireland has merely confirmed a conclusion already\r\nobvious to any unbiased mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spirit of False Morality has played as great a part in this war as\r\nthe two other evil spirits. The Scrap of Paper incident is the nearest\r\nand most obvious example of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to this essentially\r\nunchristian or Jesuitical morality. The end is German world-power, and\r\nin the attainment of this end, any means are justifiable. It is the true\r\nprinciple of Jesuitry applied to international politics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe identification is now complete. As was predicted in Revelation,\r\nthe three evil spirits have gone forth just as the decay of the Ottoman\r\npower was nearing completion, and have joined together to make the world\r\nwar. The warning, \xe2\x80\x98Behold, I come as a thief,\xe2\x80\x99 is therefore meant for\r\nthe present period--for you and me and all the world. This war will lead\r\non inevitably to the war of Armageddon, and will only be brought to an\r\nend by the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s personal return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when He returns, what will happen? Those who are in Christ, St.\r\nJohn tells us, will be called to the Supper of the Lamb. Those who are\r\nfound fighting against Him will be called to the Supper of the Great\r\nGod--that grim banquet where they shall not feast, but be feasted on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For,\xe2\x80\x99 as St. John says, \xe2\x80\x98I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he\r\ncried in a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of\r\nheaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the Great\r\nGod; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and\r\nthe flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit\r\non them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and\r\ngreat.\xe2\x80\x99 All the enemies of Christ will be slain with the sword of him\r\nthat sits upon the horse, \xe2\x80\x98and all the fowls will be filled with their\r\nflesh.\xe2\x80\x99 That is the Supper of the Great God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be soon or it may, as men reckon time, be long; but sooner or\r\nlater, inevitably, the Lord will come and deliver the world from its\r\npresent troubles. And woe unto them who are called, not to the Supper\r\nof the Lamb, but to the Supper of the Great God. They will realise\r\nthen, but too late, that God is a God of Wrath as well as a God of\r\nForgiveness. The God who sent bears to devour the mockers of Elisha,\r\nthe God who smote the Egyptians for their stubborn wickedness, will\r\nassuredly smite them too, unless they make haste to repent. But perhaps\r\nit is already too late. Who knows but that to-morrow, in a moment even,\r\nChrist may be upon us unawares, like a thief? In a little while, who\r\nknows? The angel standing in the sun may be summoning the ravens and\r\nvultures from their crannies in the rocks to feed upon the putrefying\r\nflesh of the millions of unrighteous whom God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath has destroyed. Be\r\nready, then; the coming of the Lord is at hand. May it be for all of\r\nyou an object of hope, not a moment to look forward to with terror and\r\ntrembling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bodiham closed the little pamphlet and leaned back in his chair. The\r\nargument was sound, absolutely compelling; and yet--it was four years\r\nsince he had preached that sermon; four years, and England was at peace,\r\nthe sun shone, the people of Crome were as wicked and indifferent\r\nas ever--more so, indeed, if that were possible. If only he could\r\nunderstand, if the heavens would but make a sign! But his questionings\r\nremained unanswered. Seated there in his brown varnished chair under the\r\nRuskinian window, he could have screamed aloud. He gripped the arms of\r\nhis chair--gripping, gripping for control. The knuckles of his hands\r\nwhitened; he bit his lip. In a few seconds he was able to relax the\r\ntension; he began to rebuke himself for his rebellious impatience.\r\n\r\nFour years, he reflected; what were four years, after all? It must\r\ninevitably take a long time for Armageddon to ripen to yeast itself up.\r\nThe episode of 1914 had been a preliminary skirmish. And as for the war\r\nhaving come to an end--why, that, of course, was illusory. It was still\r\ngoing on, smouldering away in Silesia, in Ireland, in Anatolia; the\r\ndiscontent in Egypt and India was preparing the way, perhaps, for a\r\ngreat extension of the slaughter among the heathen peoples. The Chinese\r\nboycott of Japan, and the rivalries of that country and America in the\r\nPacific, might be breeding a great new war in the East. The prospect,\r\nMr. Bodiham tried to assure himself, was hopeful; the real, the genuine\r\nArmageddon might soon begin, and then, like a thief in the night...But,\r\nin spite of all his comfortable reasoning, he remained unhappy,\r\ndissatisfied. Four years ago he had been so confident; God\xe2\x80\x99s intention\r\nseemed then so plain. And now? Now, he did well to be angry. And now he\r\nsuffered too.\r\n\r\nSudden and silent as a phantom Mrs. Bodiham appeared, gliding\r\nnoiselessly across the room. Above her black dress her face was pale\r\nwith an opaque whiteness, her eyes were pale as water in a glass, and\r\nher strawy hair was almost colourless. She held a large envelope in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis came for you by the post,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly.\r\n\r\nThe envelope was unsealed. Mechanically Mr. Bodiham tore it open.\r\nIt contained a pamphlet, larger than his own and more elegant in\r\nappearance. \xe2\x80\x9cThe House of Sheeny, Clerical Outfitters, Birmingham.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned over the pages. The catalogue was tastefully and ecclesiastically\r\nprinted in antique characters with illuminated Gothic initials. Red\r\nmarginal lines, crossed at the corners after the manner of an Oxford\r\npicture frame, enclosed each page of type, little red crosses took the\r\nplace of full stops. Mr. Bodiham turned the pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoutane in best black merino. Ready to wear; in all sizes. Clerical\r\nfrock coats. From nine guineas. A dressy garment, tailored by our own\r\nexperienced ecclesiastical cutters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf-tone illustrations represented young curates, some dapper, some\r\nRugbeian and muscular, some with ascetic faces and large ecstatic eyes,\r\ndressed in jackets, in frock-coats, in surplices, in clerical evening\r\ndress, in black Norfolk suitings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA large assortment of chasubles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRope girdles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSheeny\xe2\x80\x99s Special Skirt Cassocks. Tied by a string about the waist...When\r\nworn under a surplice presents an appearance indistinguishable from that\r\nof a complete cassock...Recommended for summer wear and hot climates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of horror and disgust Mr. Bodiham threw the catalogue\r\ninto the waste-paper basket. Mrs. Bodiham looked at him; her pale,\r\nglaucous eyes reflected his action without comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe village,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in her quiet voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthe village grows worse and\r\nworse every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bodiham, feeling suddenly very weary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled up a brown varnished chair and sat down. In\r\nthe village of Crome, it seemed, Sodom and Gomorrah had come to a second\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDenis did not dance, but when ragtime came squirting out of the pianola\r\nin gushes of treacle and hot perfume, in jets of Bengal light, then\r\nthings began to dance inside him. Little black nigger corpuscles jigged\r\nand drummed in his arteries. He became a cage of movement, a walking\r\npalais de danse. It was very uncomfortable, like the preliminary\r\nsymptoms of a disease. He sat in one of the window-seats, glumly\r\npretending to read.\r\n\r\nAt the pianola, Henry Wimbush, smoking a long cigar through a tunnelled\r\npillar of amber, trod out the shattering dance music with serene\r\npatience. Locked together, Gombauld and Anne moved with a harmoniousness\r\nthat made them seem a single creature, two-headed and four-legged. Mr.\r\nScogan, solemnly buffoonish, shuffled round the room with Mary. Jenny\r\nsat in the shadow behind the piano, scribbling, so it seemed, in a\r\nbig red notebook. In arm-chairs by the fireplace, Priscilla and Mr.\r\nBarbecue-Smith discussed higher things, without, apparently, being\r\ndisturbed by the noise on the Lower Plane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOptimism,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barbecue-Smith with a tone of finality, speaking\r\nthrough strains of the \xe2\x80\x9cWild, Wild Women\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9coptimism is the opening out\r\nof the soul towards the light; it is an expansion towards and into God,\r\nit is a h-piritual self-unification with the Infinite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow true!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Priscilla, nodding the baleful splendours of her\r\ncoiffure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPessimism, on the other hand, is the contraction of the soul towards\r\ndarkness; it is a focusing of the self upon a point in the Lower Plane;\r\nit is a h-piritual slavery to mere facts; to gross physical phenomena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re making a wild man of me.\xe2\x80\x9d The refrain sang itself over in\r\nDenis\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Yes, they were; damn them! A wild man, but not wild\r\nenough; that was the trouble. Wild inside; raging, writhing--yes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwrithing\xe2\x80\x9d was the word, writhing with desire. But outwardly he was\r\nhopelessly tame; outwardly--baa, baa, baa.\r\n\r\nThere they were, Anne and Gombauld, moving together as though they were\r\na single supple creature. The beast with two backs. And he sat in\r\na corner, pretending to read, pretending he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to dance,\r\npretending he rather despised dancing. Why? It was the baa-baa business\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhy was he born with a different face? Why WAS he? Gombauld had a face\r\nof brass--one of those old, brazen rams that thumped against the walls\r\nof cities till they fell. He was born with a different face--a woolly\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe music stopped. The single harmonious creature broke in two. Flushed,\r\na little breathless, Anne swayed across the room to the pianola, laid\r\nher hand on Mr. Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA waltz this time, please, Uncle Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA waltz,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and turned to the cabinet where the rolls were\r\nkept. He trod off the old roll and trod on the new, a slave at the\r\nmill, uncomplaining and beautifully well bred.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cRum; Tum; Rum-ti-ti; Tum-ti-ti...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe melody wallowed oozily along, like a ship moving forward over a\r\nsleek and oily swell. The four-legged creature, more graceful, more\r\nharmonious in its movements than ever, slid across the floor. Oh, why\r\nwas he born with a different face?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up, startled. It was Mary. She had broken from the\r\nuncomfortable embrace of Mr. Scogan, who had now seized on Jenny for his\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis truthfully. He looked at the title page; the\r\nbook was called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Stock Breeder\xe2\x80\x99s Vade Mecum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are so sensible to sit and read quietly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, fixing\r\nhim with her china eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why one dances. It\xe2\x80\x99s so boring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis made no reply; she exacerbated him. From the arm-chair by the\r\nfireplace he heard Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s deep voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Mr Barbecue-Smith--you know all about science, I know--\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\ndeprecating noise came from Mr. Barbecue-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s chair. \xe2\x80\x9cThis Einstein\r\ntheory. It seems to upset the whole starry universe. It makes me so\r\nworried about my horoscopes. You see...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary renewed her attack. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the contemporary poets do you like\r\nbest?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. Denis was filled with fury. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t this pest of\r\na girl leave him alone? He wanted to listen to the horrible music, to\r\nwatch them dancing--oh, with what grace, as though they had been made\r\nfor one another!--to savour his misery in peace. And she came and put\r\nhim through this absurd catechism! She was like \xe2\x80\x9cMangold\xe2\x80\x99s Questions\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are the three diseases of wheat?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the contemporary\r\npoets do you like best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlight, Mildew, and Smut,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with the laconism of one who is\r\nabsolutely certain of his own mind.\r\n\r\nIt was several hours before Denis managed to go to sleep that night.\r\nVague but agonising miseries possessed his mind. It was not only Anne\r\nwho made him miserable; he was wretched about himself, the future, life\r\nin general, the universe. \xe2\x80\x9cThis adolescence business,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to\r\nhimself every now and then, \xe2\x80\x9cis horribly boring.\xe2\x80\x9d But the fact that he\r\nknew his disease did not help him to cure it.\r\n\r\nAfter kicking all the clothes off the bed, he got up and sought relief\r\nin composition. He wanted to imprison his nameless misery in words. At\r\nthe end of an hour, nine more or less complete lines emerged from among\r\nthe blots and scratchings.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what I desire\r\n\r\n               When summer nights are dark and still,\r\n\r\n               When the wind\xe2\x80\x99s many-voiced quire\r\n\r\n               Sleeps among the muffled branches.\r\n\r\n               I long and know not what I will:\r\n\r\n               And not a sound of life or laughter stanches\r\n\r\n               Time\xe2\x80\x99s black and silent flow.\r\n\r\n               I do not know what I desire,\r\n\r\n               I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read it through aloud; then threw the scribbled sheet into the\r\nwaste-paper basket and got into bed again. In a very few minutes he was\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMr. Barbecue-Smith was gone. The motor had whirled him away to the\r\nstation; a faint smell of burning oil commemorated his recent departure.\r\nA considerable detachment had come into the courtyard to speed him on\r\nhis way; and now they were walking back, round the side of the house,\r\ntowards the terrace and the garden. They walked in silence; nobody had\r\nyet ventured to comment on the departed guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne at last, turning with raised inquiring eyebrows to\r\nDenis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d It was time for someone to begin.\r\n\r\nDenis declined the invitation; he passed it on to Mr Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan did not respond; he only repeated the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was left for Henry Wimbush to make a pronouncement. \xe2\x80\x9cA very agreeable\r\nadjunct to the week-end,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. His tone was obituary.\r\n\r\nThey had descended, without paying much attention where they were going,\r\nthe steep yew-walk that went down, under the flank of the terrace, to\r\nthe pool. The house towered above them, immensely tall, with the whole\r\nheight of the built-up terrace added to its own seventy feet of\r\nbrick fa\xc3\xa7ade. The perpendicular lines of the three towers soared up,\r\nuninterrupted, enhancing the impression of height until it became\r\noverwhelming. They paused at the edge of the pool to look back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who built this house knew his business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was an\r\narchitect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it. The builder of\r\nthis house was Sir Ferdinando Lapith, who flourished during the reign of\r\nElizabeth. He inherited the estate from his father, to whom it had been\r\ngranted at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries; for Crome was\r\noriginally a cloister of monks and this swimming-pool their fish-pond.\r\nSir Ferdinando was not content merely to adapt the old monastic\r\nbuildings to his own purposes; but using them as a stone quarry for his\r\nbarns and byres and outhouses, he built for himself a grand new house of\r\nbrick--the house you see now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand in the direction of the house and was silent, severe,\r\nimposing, almost menacing, Crome loomed down on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing about Crome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, seizing the opportunity\r\nto speak, \xe2\x80\x9cis the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s so unmistakably and aggressively a work\r\nof art. It makes no compromise with nature, but affronts it and\r\nrebels against it. It has no likeness to Shelley\xe2\x80\x99s tower, in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Epipsychidion,\xe2\x80\x99 which, if I remember rightly--\xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Seems not now a work of human art,\r\n\r\n               But as it were titanic, in the heart\r\n\r\n               Of earth having assumed its form and grown\r\n\r\n               Out of the mountain, from the living stone,\r\n\r\n               Lifting itself in caverns light and high.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any nonsense of that sort about Crome. That the\r\nhovels of the peasantry should look as though they had grown out of\r\nthe earth, to which their inmates are attached, is right, no doubt, and\r\nsuitable. But the house of an intelligent, civilised, and sophisticated\r\nman should never seem to have sprouted from the clods. It should rather\r\nbe an expression of his grand unnatural remoteness from the cloddish\r\nlife. Since the days of William Morris that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact which we in England\r\nhave been unable to comprehend. Civilised and sophisticated men have\r\nsolemnly played at being peasants. Hence quaintness, arts and crafts,\r\ncottage architecture, and all the rest of it. In the suburbs of our\r\ncities you may see, reduplicated in endless rows, studiedly quaint\r\nimitations and adaptations of the village hovel. Poverty, ignorance,\r\nand a limited range of materials produced the hovel, which possesses\r\nundoubtedly, in suitable surroundings, its own \xe2\x80\x98as it were titanic\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncharm. We now employ our wealth, our technical knowledge, our rich\r\nvariety of materials for the purpose of building millions of imitation\r\nhovels in totally unsuitable surroundings. Could imbecility go further?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush took up the thread of his interrupted discourse. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that\r\nyou say, my dear Scogan,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cis certainly very just, very true.\r\nBut whether Sir Ferdinando shared your views about architecture or if,\r\nindeed, he had any views about architecture at all, I very much doubt.\r\nIn building this house, Sir Ferdinando was, as a matter of fact,\r\npreoccupied by only one thought--the proper placing of his privies.\r\nSanitation was the one great interest of his life. In 1573 he even\r\npublished, on this subject, a little book--now extremely scarce--called,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certaine Priuy Counsels\xe2\x80\x99 by \xe2\x80\x98One of Her Maiestie\xe2\x80\x99s Most Honourable\r\nPriuy Counsels, F.L. Knight\xe2\x80\x99, in which the whole matter is treated with\r\ngreat learning and elegance. His guiding principle in arranging the\r\nsanitation of a house was to secure that the greatest possible distance\r\nshould separate the privy from the sewage arrangements. Hence it\r\nfollowed inevitably that the privies were to be placed at the top of the\r\nhouse, being connected by vertical shafts with pits or channels in the\r\nground. It must not be thought that Sir Ferdinando was moved only by\r\nmaterial and merely sanitary considerations; for the placing of his\r\nprivies in an exalted position he had also certain excellent spiritual\r\nreasons. For, he argues in the third chapter of his \xe2\x80\x98Priuy Counsels\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nthe necessities of nature are so base and brutish that in obeying them\r\nwe are apt to forget that we are the noblest creatures of the universe.\r\nTo counteract these degrading effects he advised that the privy should\r\nbe in every house the room nearest to heaven, that it should be well\r\nprovided with windows commanding an extensive and noble prospect,\r\nand that the walls of the chamber should be lined with bookshelves\r\ncontaining all the ripest products of human wisdom, such as the Proverbs\r\nof Solomon, Boethius\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Consolations of Philosophy\xe2\x80\x99, the apophthegms\r\nof Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, the \xe2\x80\x98Enchiridion\xe2\x80\x99 of Erasmus, and all\r\nother works, ancient or modern, which testify to the nobility of the\r\nhuman soul. In Crome he was able to put his theories into practice. At\r\nthe top of each of the three projecting towers he placed a privy. From\r\nthese a shaft went down the whole height of the house, that is to\r\nsay, more than seventy feet, through the cellars, and into a series of\r\nconduits provided with flowing water tunnelled in the ground on a level\r\nwith the base of the raised terrace. These conduits emptied themselves\r\ninto the stream several hundred yards below the fish-pond. The total\r\ndepth of the shafts from the top of the towers to their subterranean\r\nconduits was a hundred and two feet. The eighteenth century, with\r\nits passion for modernisation, swept away these monuments of sanitary\r\ningenuity. Were it not for tradition and the explicit account of them\r\nleft by Sir Ferdinando, we should be unaware that these noble privies\r\nhad ever existed. We should even suppose that Sir Ferdinando built\r\nhis house after this strange and splendid model for merely aesthetic\r\nreasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contemplation of the glories of the past always evoked in Henry\r\nWimbush a certain enthusiasm. Under the grey bowler his face worked\r\nand glowed as he spoke. The thought of these vanished privies moved\r\nhim profoundly. He ceased to speak; the light gradually died out of his\r\nface, and it became once more the replica of the grave, polite hat which\r\nshaded it. There was a long silence; the same gently melancholy thoughts\r\nseemed to possess the mind of each of them. Permanence, transience--Sir\r\nFerdinando and his privies were gone, Crome still stood. How brightly\r\nthe sun shone and how inevitable was death! The ways of God were\r\nstrange; the ways of man were stranger still...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does one\xe2\x80\x99s heart good,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Scogan at last, \xe2\x80\x9cto hear of\r\nthese fantastic English aristocrats. To have a theory about privies\r\nand to build an immense and splendid house in order to put it into\r\npractise--it\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent, beautiful! I like to think of them all: the\r\neccentric milords rolling across Europe in ponderous carriages, bound\r\non extraordinary errands. One is going to Venice to buy La Bianchi\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarynx; he won\xe2\x80\x99t get it till she\xe2\x80\x99s dead, of course, but no matter; he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprepared to wait; he has a collection, pickled in glass bottles, of\r\nthe throats of famous opera singers. And the instruments of renowned\r\nvirtuosi--he goes in for them too; he will try to bribe Paganini to part\r\nwith his little Guarnerio, but he has small hope of success. Paganini\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t sell his fiddle; but perhaps he might sacrifice one of his\r\nguitars. Others are bound on crusades--one to die miserably among the\r\nsavage Greeks, another, in his white top hat, to lead Italians against\r\ntheir oppressors. Others have no business at all; they are just giving\r\ntheir oddity a continental airing. At home they cultivate themselves at\r\nleisure and with greater elaboration. Beckford builds towers, Portland\r\ndigs holes in the ground, Cavendish, the millionaire, lives in a stable,\r\neats nothing but mutton, and amuses himself--oh, solely for his private\r\ndelectation--by anticipating the electrical discoveries of half a\r\ncentury. Glorious eccentrics! Every age is enlivened by their presence.\r\nSome day, my dear Denis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Scogan, turning a beady bright regard\r\nin his direction--\xe2\x80\x9csome day you must become their biographer--\xe2\x80\x98The Lives\r\nof Queer Men.\xe2\x80\x99 What a subject! I should like to undertake it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan paused, looked up once more at the towering house, then\r\nmurmured the word \xe2\x80\x9cEccentricity,\xe2\x80\x9d two or three times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEccentricity...It\xe2\x80\x99s the justification of all aristocracies. It\r\njustifies leisured classes and inherited wealth and privilege and\r\nendowments and all the other injustices of that sort. If you\xe2\x80\x99re to do\r\nanything reasonable in this world, you must have a class of people who\r\nare secure, safe from public opinion, safe from poverty, leisured, not\r\ncompelled to waste their time in the imbecile routines that go by the\r\nname of Honest Work. You must have a class of which the members can\r\nthink and, within the obvious limits, do what they please. You must have\r\na class in which people who have eccentricities can indulge them and in\r\nwhich eccentricity in general will be tolerated and understood. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe important thing about an aristocracy. Not only is it eccentric\r\nitself--often grandiosely so; it also tolerates and even encourages\r\neccentricity in others. The eccentricities of the artist and the\r\nnew-fangled thinker don\xe2\x80\x99t inspire it with that fear, loathing, and\r\ndisgust which the burgesses instinctively feel towards them. It is a\r\nsort of Red Indian Reservation planted in the midst of a vast horde of\r\nPoor Whites--colonials at that. Within its boundaries wild men disport\r\nthemselves--often, it must be admitted, a little grossly, a little too\r\nflamboyantly; and when kindred spirits are born outside the pale it\r\noffers them some sort of refuge from the hatred which the Poor Whites,\r\nen bons bourgeois, lavish on anything that is wild or out of the\r\nordinary. After the social revolution there will be no Reservations;\r\nthe Redskins will be drowned in the great sea of Poor Whites. What then?\r\nWill they suffer you to go on writing villanelles, my good Denis? Will\r\nyou, unhappy Henry, be allowed to live in this house of the splendid\r\nprivies, to continue your quiet delving in the mines of futile\r\nknowledge? Will Anne...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you be allowed to go on\r\ntalking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may rest assured,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall not. I shall\r\nhave some Honest Work to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nBlight, Mildew, and Smut...\xe2\x80\x9d Mary was puzzled and distressed. Perhaps\r\nher ears had played her false. Perhaps what he had really said was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSquire, Binyon, and Shanks,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cChilde, Blunden, and Earp,\xe2\x80\x9d or even\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbercrombie, Drinkwater, and Rabindranath Tagore.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps. But then\r\nher ears never did play her false. \xe2\x80\x9cBlight, Mildew, and Smut.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nimpression was distinct and ineffaceable. \xe2\x80\x9cBlight, Mildew...\xe2\x80\x9d she was\r\nforced to the conclusion, reluctantly, that Denis had indeed pronounced\r\nthose improbable words. He had deliberately repelled her attempts to\r\nopen a serious discussion. That was horrible. A man who would not talk\r\nseriously to a woman just because she was a woman--oh, impossible!\r\nEgeria or nothing. Perhaps Gombauld would be more satisfactory. True,\r\nhis meridional heredity was a little disquieting; but at least he was\r\na serious worker, and it was with his work that she would associate\r\nherself. And Denis? After all, what WAS Denis? A dilettante, an\r\namateur...\r\n\r\nGombauld had annexed for his painting-room a little disused granary that\r\nstood by itself in a green close beyond the farm-yard. It was a square\r\nbrick building with a peaked roof and little windows set high up in each\r\nof its walls. A ladder of four rungs led up to the door; for the granary\r\nwas perched above the ground, and out of reach of the rats, on four\r\nmassive toadstools of grey stone. Within, there lingered a faint smell\r\nof dust and cobwebs; and the narrow shaft of sunlight that came slanting\r\nin at every hour of the day through one of the little windows was\r\nalways alive with silvery motes. Here Gombauld worked, with a kind of\r\nconcentrated ferocity, during six or seven hours of each day. He was\r\npursuing something new, something terrific, if only he could catch it.\r\n\r\nDuring the last eight years, nearly half of which had been spent in the\r\nprocess of winning the war, he had worked his way industriously through\r\ncubism. Now he had come out on the other side. He had begun by painting\r\na formalised nature; then, little by little, he had risen from nature\r\ninto the world of pure form, till in the end he was painting nothing but\r\nhis own thoughts, externalised in the abstract geometrical forms of\r\nthe mind\xe2\x80\x99s devising. He found the process arduous and exhilarating. And\r\nthen, quite suddenly, he grew dissatisfied; he felt himself cramped and\r\nconfined within intolerably narrow limitations. He was humiliated to\r\nfind how few and crude and uninteresting were the forms he could invent;\r\nthe inventions of nature were without number, inconceivably subtle and\r\nelaborate. He had done with cubism. He was out on the other side. But\r\nthe cubist discipline preserved him from falling into excesses of nature\r\nworship. He took from nature its rich, subtle, elaborate forms, but his\r\naim was always to work them into a whole that should have the thrilling\r\nsimplicity and formality of an idea; to combine prodigious realism\r\nwith prodigious simplification. Memories of Caravaggio\xe2\x80\x99s portentous\r\nachievements haunted him. Forms of a breathing, living reality emerged\r\nfrom darkness, built themselves up into compositions as luminously\r\nsimple and single as a mathematical idea. He thought of the \xe2\x80\x9cCall of\r\nMatthew,\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Crucified,\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cLute players,\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He had the secret, that astonishing ruffian, he had the secret! And\r\nnow Gombauld was after it, in hot pursuit. Yes, it would be something\r\nterrific, if only he could catch it.\r\n\r\nFor a long time an idea had been stirring and spreading, yeastily,\r\nin his mind. He had made a portfolio full of studies, he had drawn a\r\ncartoon; and now the idea was taking shape on canvas. A man fallen from\r\na horse. The huge animal, a gaunt white cart-horse, filled the upper\r\nhalf of the picture with its great body. Its head, lowered towards the\r\nground, was in shadow; the immense bony body was what arrested the eye,\r\nthe body and the legs, which came down on either side of the picture\r\nlike the pillars of an arch. On the ground, between the legs of the\r\ntowering beast, lay the foreshortened figure of a man, the head in the\r\nextreme foreground, the arms flung wide to right and left. A white,\r\nrelentless light poured down from a point in the right foreground. The\r\nbeast, the fallen man, were sharply illuminated; round them, beyond and\r\nbehind them, was the night. They were alone in the darkness, a universe\r\nin themselves. The horse\xe2\x80\x99s body filled the upper part of the picture;\r\nthe legs, the great hoofs, frozen to stillness in the midst of their\r\ntrampling, limited it on either side. And beneath lay the man,\r\nhis foreshortened face at the focal point in the centre, his arms\r\noutstretched towards the sides of the picture. Under the arch of the\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s belly, between his legs, the eye looked through into an intense\r\ndarkness; below, the space was closed in by the figure of the prostrate\r\nman. A central gulf of darkness surrounded by luminous forms...\r\n\r\nThe picture was more than half finished. Gombauld had been at work all\r\nthe morning on the figure of the man, and now he was taking a rest--the\r\ntime to smoke a cigarette. Tilting back his chair till it touched the\r\nwall, he looked thoughtfully at his canvas. He was pleased, and at the\r\nsame time he was desolated. In itself, the thing was good; he knew\r\nit. But that something he was after, that something that would be so\r\nterrific if only he could catch it--had he caught it? Would he ever\r\ncatch it?\r\n\r\nThree little taps--rat, tat, tat! Surprised, Gombauld turned his eyes\r\ntowards the door. Nobody ever disturbed him while he was at work; it\r\nwas one of the unwritten laws. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d he called. The door, which was\r\najar, swung open, revealing, from the waist upwards, the form of Mary.\r\nShe had only dared to mount half-way up the ladder. If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nher, retreat would be easier and more dignified than if she climbed to\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe skipped up the remaining two rungs and was over the threshold in\r\nan instant. \xe2\x80\x9cA letter came for you by the second post,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought it might be important, so I brought it out to you.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes,\r\nher childish face were luminously candid as she handed him the letter.\r\nThere had never been a flimsier pretext.\r\n\r\nGombauld looked at the envelope and put it in his pocket unopened.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all important. Thanks very much all the\r\nsame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence; Mary felt a little uncomfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I have a\r\nlook at what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been painting?\xe2\x80\x9d she had the courage to say at last.\r\n\r\nGombauld had only half smoked his cigarette; in any case he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbegin work again till he had finished. He would give her the five\r\nminutes that separated him from the bitter end. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best place\r\nto see it from,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMary looked at the picture for some time without saying anything.\r\nIndeed, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say; she was taken aback, she was at a\r\nloss. She had expected a cubist masterpiece, and here was a picture of a\r\nman and a horse, not only recognisable as such, but even aggressively\r\nin drawing. Trompe-l\xe2\x80\x99oeil--there was no other word to describe the\r\ndelineation of that foreshortened figure under the trampling feet of the\r\nhorse. What was she to think, what was she to say? Her orientations\r\nwere gone. One could admire representationalism in the Old Masters.\r\nObviously. But in a modern...? At eighteen she might have done so.\r\nBut now, after five years of schooling among the best judges, her\r\ninstinctive reaction to a contemporary piece of representation was\r\ncontempt--an outburst of laughing disparagement. What could Gombauld be\r\nup to? She had felt so safe in admiring his work before. But now--she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think. It was very difficult, very difficult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s rather a lot of chiaroscuro, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d she ventured at\r\nlast, and inwardly congratulated herself on having found a critical\r\nformula so gentle and at the same time so penetrating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is,\xe2\x80\x9d Gombauld agreed.\r\n\r\nMary was pleased; he accepted her criticism; it was a serious\r\ndiscussion. She put her head on one side and screwed up her eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully fine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course it\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\ntoo...too...trompe-l\xe2\x80\x99oeil for my taste.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at Gombauld, who\r\nmade no response, but continued to smoke, gazing meditatively all the\r\ntime at his picture. Mary went on gaspingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was in Paris this\r\nspring I saw a lot of Tschuplitski. I admire his work so tremendously.\r\nOf course, it\xe2\x80\x99s frightfully abstract now--frightfully abstract and\r\nfrightfully intellectual. He just throws a few oblongs on to his\r\ncanvas--quite flat, you know, and painted in pure primary colours. But\r\nhis design is wonderful. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting more and more abstract every day.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d given up the third dimension when I was there and was just thinking\r\nof giving up the second. Soon, he says, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be just the blank\r\ncanvas. That\xe2\x80\x99s the logical conclusion. Complete abstraction. Painting\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinished; he\xe2\x80\x99s finishing it. When he\xe2\x80\x99s reached pure abstraction he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to take up architecture. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s more intellectual than\r\npainting. Do you agree?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a final gasp.\r\n\r\nGombauld dropped his cigarette end and trod on it. \xe2\x80\x9cTschuplitski\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinished painting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve finished my cigarette. But I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\non painting.\xe2\x80\x9d And, advancing towards her, he put his arm round her\r\nshoulders and turned her round, away from the picture.\r\n\r\nMary looked up at him; her hair swung back, a soundless bell of gold.\r\nHer eyes were serene; she smiled. So the moment had come. His arm was\r\nround her. He moved slowly, almost imperceptibly, and she moved with\r\nhim. It was a peripatetic embracement. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you agree with him?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated. The moment might have come, but she would not cease to be\r\nintellectual, serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I shall have to think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d Gombauld loosened his\r\nembrace, his hand dropped from her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful going down the\r\nladder,\xe2\x80\x9d he added solicitously.\r\n\r\nMary looked round, startled. They were in front of the open door. She\r\nremained standing there for a moment in bewilderment. The hand that\r\nhad rested on her shoulder made itself felt lower down her back; it\r\nadministered three or four kindly little smacks. Replying automatically\r\nto its stimulus, she moved forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful going down the ladder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gombauld once more.\r\n\r\nShe was careful. The door closed behind her and she was alone in the\r\nlittle green close. She walked slowly back through the farmyard; she was\r\npensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush brought down with him to dinner a budget of printed sheets\r\nloosely bound together in a cardboard portfolio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, exhibiting it with a certain solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cto-day I\r\nhave finished the printing of my \xe2\x80\x98History of Crome\xe2\x80\x99. I helped to set up\r\nthe type of the last page this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe famous History?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne. The writing and the printing of this\r\nMagnum Opus had been going on as long as she could remember. All her\r\nchildhood long Uncle Henry\xe2\x80\x99s History had been a vague and fabulous\r\nthing, often heard of and never seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has taken me nearly thirty years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wimbush. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five\r\nyears of writing and nearly four of printing. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s finished--the\r\nwhole chronicle, from Sir Ferdinando Lapith\xe2\x80\x99s birth to the death of my\r\nfather William Wimbush--more than three centuries and a half: a history\r\nof Crome, written at Crome, and printed at Crome by my own press.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we be allowed to read it now it\xe2\x80\x99s finished?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Denis.\r\n\r\nMr. Wimbush nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope you will not find\r\nit uninteresting,\xe2\x80\x9d he added modestly. \xe2\x80\x9cOur muniment room is particularly\r\nrich in ancient records, and I have some genuinely new light to throw on\r\nthe introduction of the three-pronged fork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the people?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gombauld. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Ferdinando and the rest of\r\nthem--were they amusing? Were there any crimes or tragedies in the\r\nfamily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Wimbush rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only\r\nthink of two suicides, one violent death, four or perhaps five broken\r\nhearts, and half a dozen little blots on the scutcheon in the way of\r\nmisalliances, seductions, natural children, and the like. No, on the\r\nwhole, it\xe2\x80\x99s a placid and uneventful record.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Wimbushes and the Lapiths were always an unadventurous, respectable\r\ncrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, with a note of scorn in her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to\r\nwrite my family history now! Why, it would be one long continuous blot\r\nfrom beginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed jovially, and helped herself to\r\nanother glass of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to write mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\r\nAfter the second generation we Scogans are lost in the mists of\r\nantiquity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush, a little piqued by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisparaging comment on the masters of Crome, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll read you an episode\r\nfrom my History that will make you admit that even the Lapiths, in their\r\nown respectable way, had their tragedies and strange adventures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to hear what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jenny, emerging suddenly from her private\r\ninterior world like a cuckoo from a clock. She received an explanation,\r\nsmiled, nodded, cuckooed at last \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d and popped back, clapping shut\r\nthe door behind her.\r\n\r\nDinner was eaten; the party had adjourned to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush, pulling up a chair to the lamp. He put on\r\nhis round pince-nez, rimmed with tortoise-shell, and began cautiously\r\nto turn over the pages of his loose and still fragmentary book. He found\r\nhis place at last. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I begin?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, yawning.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of an attentive silence Mr. Wimbush gave a little\r\npreliminary cough and started to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe infant who was destined to become the fourth baronet of the name of\r\nLapith was born in the year 1740. He was a very small baby, weighing not\r\nmore than three pounds at birth, but from the first he was sturdy and\r\nhealthy. In honour of his maternal grandfather, Sir Hercules Occam of\r\nBishop\xe2\x80\x99s Occam, he was christened Hercules. His mother, like many other\r\nmothers, kept a notebook, in which his progress from month to month was\r\nrecorded. He walked at ten months, and before his second year was out\r\nhe had learnt to speak a number of words. At three years he weighed but\r\ntwenty-four pounds, and at six, though he could read and write perfectly\r\nand showed a remarkable aptitude for music, he was no larger and heavier\r\nthan a well-grown child of two. Meanwhile, his mother had borne two\r\nother children, a boy and a girl, one of whom died of croup during\r\ninfancy, while the other was carried off by smallpox before it reached\r\nthe age of five. Hercules remained the only surviving child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn his twelfth birthday Hercules was still only three feet and two\r\ninches in height. His head, which was very handsome and nobly shaped,\r\nwas too big for his body, but otherwise he was exquisitely proportioned,\r\nand, for his size, of great strength and agility. His parents, in the\r\nhope of making him grow, consulted all the most eminent physicians of\r\nthe time. Their various prescriptions were followed to the letter, but\r\nin vain. One ordered a very plentiful meat diet; another exercise; a\r\nthird constructed a little rack, modelled on those employed by the Holy\r\nInquisition, on which young Hercules was stretched, with excruciating\r\ntorments, for half an hour every morning and evening. In the course of\r\nthe next three years Hercules gained perhaps two inches. After that his\r\ngrowth stopped completely, and he remained for the rest of his life a\r\npigmy of three feet and four inches. His father, who had built the most\r\nextravagant hopes upon his son, planning for him in his imagination\r\na military career equal to that of Marlborough, found himself a\r\ndisappointed man. \xe2\x80\x98I have brought an abortion into the world,\xe2\x80\x99 he would\r\nsay, and he took so violent a dislike to his son that the boy dared\r\nscarcely come into his presence. His temper, which had been serene,\r\nwas turned by disappointment to moroseness and savagery. He avoided all\r\ncompany (being, as he said, ashamed to show himself, the father of a\r\nlusus naturae, among normal, healthy human beings), and took to solitary\r\ndrinking, which carried him very rapidly to his grave; for the year\r\nbefore Hercules came of age his father was taken off by an apoplexy. His\r\nmother, whose love for him had increased with the growth of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunkindness, did not long survive, but little more than a year after\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s death succumbed, after eating two dozen of oysters, to an\r\nattack of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHercules thus found himself at the age of twenty-one alone in the\r\nworld, and master of a considerable fortune, including the estate and\r\nmansion of Crome. The beauty and intelligence of his childhood had\r\nsurvived into his manly age, and, but for his dwarfish stature, he would\r\nhave taken his place among the handsomest and most accomplished young\r\nmen of his time. He was well read in the Greek and Latin authors, as\r\nwell as in all the moderns of any merit who had written in English,\r\nFrench, or Italian. He had a good ear for music, and was no indifferent\r\nperformer on the violin, which he used to play like a bass viol, seated\r\non a chair with the instrument between his legs. To the music of the\r\nharpsichord and clavichord he was extremely partial, but the smallness\r\nof his hands made it impossible for him ever to perform upon these\r\ninstruments. He had a small ivory flute made for him, on which,\r\nwhenever he was melancholy, he used to play a simple country air or jig,\r\naffirming that this rustic music had more power to clear and raise the\r\nspirits than the most artificial productions of the masters. From an\r\nearly age he practised the composition of poetry, but, though conscious\r\nof his great powers in this art, he would never publish any specimen of\r\nhis writing. \xe2\x80\x98My stature,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say, \xe2\x80\x98is reflected in my verses; if\r\nthe public were to read them it would not be because I am a poet,\r\nbut because I am a dwarf.\xe2\x80\x99 Several MS. books of Sir Hercules\xe2\x80\x99s poems\r\nsurvive.

For though by no means ashamed of his deformity--indeed,\r\nif we may judge from the poem quoted above, he regarded himself as being\r\nin many ways superior to the ordinary race of man--he found the presence\r\nof full-grown men and women embarrassing. Realising, too, that he\r\nmust abandon all ambitions in the great world, he determined to retire\r\nabsolutely from it and to create, as it were, at Crome a private\r\nworld of his own, in which all should be proportionable to himself.\r\nAccordingly, he discharged all the old servants of the house and\r\nreplaced them gradually, as he was able to find suitable successors,\r\nby others of dwarfish stature. In the course of a few years he had\r\nassembled about himself a numerous household, no member of which was\r\nabove four feet high and the smallest among them scarcely two feet and\r\nsix inches. His father\xe2\x80\x99s dogs, such as setters, mastiffs, greyhounds,\r\nand a pack of beagles, he sold or gave away as too large and too\r\nboisterous for his house, replacing them by pugs and King Charles\r\nspaniels and whatever other breeds of dog were the smallest. His\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s stable was also sold. For his own use, whether riding or\r\ndriving, he had six black Shetland ponies, with four very choice piebald\r\nanimals of New Forest breed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving thus settled his household entirely to his own satisfaction, it\r\nonly remained for him to find some suitable companion with whom to share\r\nhis paradise. Sir Hercules had a susceptible heart, and had more than\r\nonce, between the ages of sixteen and twenty, felt what it was to love.\r\nBut here his deformity had been a source of the most bitter humiliation,\r\nfor, having once dared to declare himself to a young lady of his choice,\r\nhe had been received with laughter. On his persisting, she had picked\r\nhim up and shaken him like an importunate child, telling him to run away\r\nand plague her no more. The story soon got about--indeed, the young lady\r\nherself used to tell it as a particularly pleasant anecdote--and\r\nthe taunts and mockery it occasioned were a source of the most acute\r\ndistress to Hercules. From the poems written at this period we gather\r\nthat he meditated taking his own life. In course of time, however, he\r\nlived down this humiliation; but never again, though he often fell in\r\nlove, and that very passionately, did he dare to make any advances to\r\nthose in whom he was interested. After coming to the estate and finding\r\nthat he was in a position to create his own world as he desired it, he\r\nsaw that, if he was to have a wife--which he very much desired, being\r\nof an affectionate and, indeed, amorous temper--he must choose her as\r\nhe had chosen his servants--from among the race of dwarfs. But to find\r\na suitable wife was, he found, a matter of some difficulty; for he would\r\nmarry none who was not distinguished by beauty and gentle birth. The\r\ndwarfish daughter of Lord Bemboro he refused on the ground that besides\r\nbeing a pigmy she was hunchbacked; while another young lady, an orphan\r\nbelonging to a very good family in Hampshire, was rejected by him\r\nbecause her face, like that of so many dwarfs, was wizened and\r\nrepulsive. Finally, when he was almost despairing of success, he\r\nheard from a reliable source that Count Titimalo, a Venetian nobleman,\r\npossessed a daughter of exquisite beauty and great accomplishments, who\r\nwas by three feet in height. Setting out at once for Venice, he went\r\nimmediately on his arrival to pay his respects to the count, whom he\r\nfound living with his wife and five children in a very mean apartment\r\nin one of the poorer quarters of the town. Indeed, the count was so far\r\nreduced in his circumstances that he was even then negotiating (so it\r\nwas rumoured) with a travelling company of clowns and acrobats, who had\r\nhad the misfortune to lose their performing dwarf, for the sale of his\r\ndiminutive daughter Filomena. Sir Hercules arrived in time to save her\r\nfrom this untoward fate, for he was so much charmed by Filomena\xe2\x80\x99s grace\r\nand beauty, that at the end of three days\xe2\x80\x99 courtship he made her a\r\nformal offer of marriage, which was accepted by her no less joyfully\r\nthan by her father, who perceived in an English son-in-law a rich and\r\nunfailing source of revenue. After an unostentatious marriage, at which\r\nthe English ambassador acted as one of the witnesses, Sir Hercules and\r\nhis bride returned by sea to England, where they settled down, as it\r\nproved, to a life of uneventful happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrome and its household of dwarfs delighted Filomena, who felt herself\r\nnow for the first time to be a free woman living among her equals in\r\na friendly world. She had many tastes in common with her husband,\r\nespecially that of music. She had a beautiful voice, of a power\r\nsurprising in one so small, and could touch A in alt without effort.\r\nAccompanied by her husband on his fine Cremona fiddle, which he played,\r\nas we have noted before, as one plays a bass viol, she would sing all\r\nthe liveliest and tenderest airs from the operas and cantatas of her\r\nnative country. Seated together at the harpsichord, they found that they\r\ncould with their four hands play all the music written for two hands\r\nof ordinary size, a circumstance which gave Sir Hercules unfailing\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they were not making music or reading together, which they often\r\ndid, both in English and Italian, they spent their time in healthful\r\noutdoor exercises, sometimes rowing in a little boat on the lake, but\r\nmore often riding or driving, occupations in which, because they were\r\nentirely new to her, Filomena especially delighted. When she had become\r\na perfectly proficient rider, Filomena and her husband used often to go\r\nhunting in the park, at that time very much more extensive than it is\r\nnow. They hunted not foxes nor hares, but rabbits, using a pack of\r\nabout thirty black and fawn-coloured pugs, a kind of dog which, when not\r\noverfed, can course a rabbit as well as any of the smaller breeds. Four\r\ndwarf grooms, dressed in scarlet liveries and mounted on white Exmoor\r\nponies, hunted the pack, while their master and mistress, in green\r\nhabits, followed either on the black Shetlands or on the piebald New\r\nForest ponies. A picture of the whole hunt--dogs, horses, grooms, and\r\nmasters--was painted by William Stubbs, whose work Sir Hercules admired\r\nso much that he invited him, though a man of ordinary stature, to come\r\nand stay at the mansion for the purpose of executing this picture.\r\nStubbs likewise painted a portrait of Sir Hercules and his lady driving\r\nin their green enamelled calash drawn by four black Shetlands. Sir\r\nHercules wears a plum-coloured velvet coat and white breeches; Filomena\r\nis dressed in flowered muslin and a very large hat with pink feathers.\r\nThe two figures in their gay carriage stand out sharply against a dark\r\nbackground of trees; but to the left of the picture the trees fall away\r\nand disappear, so that the four black ponies are seen against a pale and\r\nstrangely lurid sky that has the golden-brown colour of thunder-clouds\r\nlighted up by the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way four years passed happily by. At the end of that time\r\nFilomena found herself great with child. Sir Hercules was overjoyed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If God is good,\xe2\x80\x99 he wrote in his day-book, \xe2\x80\x98the name of Lapith will be\r\npreserved and our rarer and more delicate race transmitted through the\r\ngenerations until in the fullness of time the world shall recognise the\r\nsuperiority of those beings whom now it uses to make mock of.\xe2\x80\x99 On his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s being brought to bed of a son he wrote a poem to the same effect.\r\nThe child was christened Ferdinando in memory of the builder of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the passage of the months a certain sense of disquiet began to\r\ninvade the minds of Sir Hercules and his lady. For the child was growing\r\nwith an extraordinary rapidity. At a year he weighed as much as Hercules\r\nhad weighed when he was three. \xe2\x80\x98Ferdinando goes crescendo,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote\r\nFilomena in her diary. \xe2\x80\x98It seems not natural.\xe2\x80\x99 At eighteen months the\r\nbaby was almost as tall as their smallest jockey, who was a man of\r\nthirty-six. Could it be that Ferdinando was destined to become a man of\r\nthe normal, gigantic dimensions? It was a thought to which neither of\r\nhis parents dared yet give open utterance, but in the secrecy of their\r\nrespective diaries they brooded over it in terror and dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn his third birthday Ferdinando was taller than his mother and not\r\nmore than a couple of inches short of his father\xe2\x80\x99s height. \xe2\x80\x98To-day for\r\nthe first time\xe2\x80\x99 wrote Sir Hercules, \xe2\x80\x98we discussed the situation. The\r\nhideous truth can be concealed no longer: Ferdinando is not one of us.\r\nOn this, his third birthday, a day when we should have been rejoicing at\r\nthe health, the strength, and beauty of our child, we wept together over\r\nthe ruin of our happiness. God give us strength to bear this cross.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the age of eight Ferdinando was so large and so exuberantly healthy\r\nthat his parents decided, though reluctantly, to send him to school.\r\nHe was packed off to Eton at the beginning of the next half. A profound\r\npeace settled upon the house. Ferdinando returned for the summer\r\nholidays larger and stronger than ever. One day he knocked down the\r\nbutler and broke his arm. \xe2\x80\x98He is rough, inconsiderate, unamenable to\r\npersuasion,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote his father. \xe2\x80\x98The only thing that will teach him\r\nmanners is corporal chastisement.\xe2\x80\x99 Ferdinando, who at this age was\r\nalready seventeen inches taller than his father, received no corporal\r\nchastisement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne summer holidays about three years later Ferdinando returned to\r\nCrome accompanied by a very large mastiff dog. He had bought it from an\r\nold man at Windsor who had found the beast too expensive to feed. It\r\nwas a savage, unreliable animal; hardly had it entered the house when it\r\nattacked one of Sir Hercules\xe2\x80\x99s favourite pugs, seizing the creature in\r\nits jaws and shaking it till it was nearly dead. Extremely put out by\r\nthis occurrence, Sir Hercules ordered that the beast should be chained\r\nup in the stable-yard. Ferdinando sullenly answered that the dog was\r\nhis, and he would keep it where he pleased. His father, growing angry,\r\nbade him take the animal out of the house at once, on pain of his utmost\r\ndispleasure. Ferdinando refused to move. His mother at this moment\r\ncoming into the room, the dog flew at her, knocked her down, and in\r\na twinkling had very severely mauled her arm and shoulder; in another\r\ninstant it must infallibly have had her by the throat, had not Sir\r\nHercules drawn his sword and stabbed the animal to the heart. Turning on\r\nhis son, he ordered him to leave the room immediately, as being unfit to\r\nremain in the same place with the mother whom he had nearly murdered. So\r\nawe-inspiring was the spectacle of Sir Hercules standing with one foot\r\non the carcase of the gigantic dog, his sword drawn and still bloody, so\r\ncommanding were his voice, his gestures, and the expression of his face\r\nthat Ferdinando slunk out of the room in terror and behaved himself\r\nfor all the rest of the vacation in an entirely exemplary fashion. His\r\nmother soon recovered from the bites of the mastiff, but the effect on\r\nher mind of this adventure was ineradicable; from that time forth she\r\nlived always among imaginary terrors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two years which Ferdinando spent on the Continent, making the Grand\r\nTour, were a period of happy repose for his parents. But even now\r\nthe thought of the future haunted them; nor were they able to solace\r\nthemselves with all the diversions of their younger days. The Lady\r\nFilomena had lost her voice and Sir Hercules was grown too rheumatical\r\nto play the violin. He, it is true, still rode after his pugs, but his\r\nwife felt herself too old and, since the episode of the mastiff, too\r\nnervous for such sports. At most, to please her husband, she would\r\nfollow the hunt at a distance in a little gig drawn by the safest and\r\noldest of the Shetlands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day fixed for Ferdinando\xe2\x80\x99s return came round. Filomena, sick with\r\nvague dreads and presentiments, retired to her chamber and her bed.\r\nSir Hercules received his son alone. A giant in a brown travelling-suit\r\nentered the room. \xe2\x80\x98Welcome home, my son,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Hercules in a voice\r\nthat trembled a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I hope I see you well, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Ferdinando bent down to shake hands, then\r\nstraightened himself up again. The top of his father\xe2\x80\x99s head reached to\r\nthe level of his hip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFerdinando had not come alone. Two friends of his own age accompanied\r\nhim, and each of the young men had brought a servant. Not for thirty\r\nyears had Crome been desecrated by the presence of so many members of\r\nthe common race of men. Sir Hercules was appalled and indignant, but the\r\nlaws of hospitality had to be obeyed. He received the young gentlemen\r\nwith grave politeness and sent the servants to the kitchen, with orders\r\nthat they should be well cared for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old family dining-table was dragged out into the light and dusted\r\n(Sir Hercules and his lady were accustomed to dine at a small table\r\ntwenty inches high). Simon, the aged butler, who could only just look\r\nover the edge of the big table, was helped at supper by the three\r\nservants brought by Ferdinando and his guests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Hercules presided, and with his usual grace supported a\r\nconversation on the pleasures of foreign travel, the beauties of art and\r\nnature to be met with abroad, the opera at Venice, the singing of the\r\norphans in the churches of the same city, and on other topics of a\r\nsimilar nature. The young men were not particularly attentive to his\r\ndiscourses; they were occupied in watching the efforts of the butler to\r\nchange the plates and replenish the glasses. They covered their laughter\r\nby violent and repeated fits of coughing or choking. Sir Hercules\r\naffected not to notice, but changed the subject of the conversation to\r\nsport. Upon this one of the young men asked whether it was true, as he\r\nhad heard, that he used to hunt the rabbit with a pack of pug dogs. Sir\r\nHercules replied that it was, and proceeded to describe the chase in\r\nsome detail. The young men roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen supper was over, Sir Hercules climbed down from his chair and,\r\ngiving as his excuse that he must see how his lady did, bade them\r\ngood-night. The sound of laughter followed him up the stairs. Filomena\r\nwas not asleep; she had been lying on her bed listening to the sound of\r\nenormous laughter and the tread of strangely heavy feet on the stairs\r\nand along the corridors. Sir Hercules drew a chair to her bedside\r\nand sat there for a long time in silence, holding his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hand and\r\nsometimes gently squeezing it. At about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock they were startled\r\nby a violent noise. There was a breaking of glass, a stamping of feet,\r\nwith an outburst of shouts and laughter. The uproar continuing for\r\nseveral minutes, Sir Hercules rose to his feet and, in spite of his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties, prepared to go and see what was happening. There\r\nwas no light on the staircase, and Sir Hercules groped his way down\r\ncautiously, lowering himself from stair to stair and standing for a\r\nmoment on each tread before adventuring on a new step. The noise was\r\nlouder here; the shouting articulated itself into recognisable words\r\nand phrases. A line of light was visible under the dining-room door. Sir\r\nHercules tiptoed across the hall towards it. Just as he approached the\r\ndoor there was another terrific crash of breaking glass and jangled\r\nmetal. What could they be doing? Standing on tiptoe he managed to look\r\nthrough the keyhole. In the middle of the ravaged table old Simon, the\r\nbutler, so primed with drink that he could scarcely keep his balance,\r\nwas dancing a jig. His feet crunched and tinkled among the broken glass,\r\nand his shoes were wet with spilt wine. The three young men sat round,\r\nthumping the table with their hands or with the empty wine bottles,\r\nshouting and laughing encouragement. The three servants leaning against\r\nthe wall laughed too. Ferdinando suddenly threw a handful of walnuts at\r\nthe dancer\xe2\x80\x99s head, which so dazed and surprised the little man that he\r\nstaggered and fell down on his back, upsetting a decanter and several\r\nglasses. They raised him up, gave him some brandy to drink, thumped\r\nhim on the back. The old man smiled and hiccoughed. \xe2\x80\x98To-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nFerdinando, \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a concerted ballet of the whole household.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With father Hercules wearing his club and lion-skin,\xe2\x80\x99 added one of his\r\ncompanions, and all three roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Hercules would look and listen no further. He crossed the hall once\r\nmore and began to climb the stairs, lifting his knees painfully high\r\nat each degree. This was the end; there was no place for him now in the\r\nworld, no place for him and Ferdinando together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wife was still awake; to her questioning glance he answered, \xe2\x80\x98They\r\nare making mock of old Simon. To-morrow it will be our turn.\xe2\x80\x99 They were\r\nsilent for a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last Filomena said, \xe2\x80\x98I do not want to see to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is better not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Hercules. Going into his closet he wrote\r\nin his day-book a full and particular account of all the events of the\r\nevening. While he was still engaged in this task he rang for a servant\r\nand ordered hot water and a bath to be made ready for him at eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. When he had finished writing he went into his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room, and\r\npreparing a dose of opium twenty times as strong as that which she\r\nwas accustomed to take when she could not sleep, he brought it to her,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98Here is your sleeping-draught.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFilomena took the glass and lay for a little time, but did not drink\r\nimmediately. The tears came into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Do you remember the songs we\r\nused to sing, sitting out there sulla terrazza in the summer-time?\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nbegan singing softly in her ghost of a cracked voice a few bars from\r\nStradella\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Amor amor, non dormir piu.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And you playing on the violin,\r\nit seems such a short time ago, and yet so long, long, long. Addio,\r\namore, a rivederti.\xe2\x80\x99 She drank off the draught and, lying back on the\r\npillow, closed her eyes. Sir Hercules kissed her hand and tiptoed away,\r\nas though he were afraid of waking her. He returned to his closet, and\r\nhaving recorded his wife\xe2\x80\x99s last words to him, he poured into his bath\r\nthe water that had been brought up in accordance with his orders. The\r\nwater being too hot for him to get into the bath at once, he took down\r\nfrom the shelf his copy of Suetonius. He wished to read how Seneca had\r\ndied. He opened the book at random. \xe2\x80\x98But dwarfs,\xe2\x80\x99 he read, \xe2\x80\x98he held in\r\nabhorrence as being lusus naturae and of evil omen.\xe2\x80\x99 He winced as though\r\nhe had been struck. This same Augustus, he remembered, had exhibited in\r\nthe amphitheatre a young man called Lucius, of good family, who was\r\nnot quite two feet in height and weighed seventeen pounds, but had\r\na stentorian voice. He turned over the pages. Tiberius, Caligula,\r\nClaudius, Nero: it was a tale of growing horror. \xe2\x80\x98Seneca his preceptor,\r\nhe forced to kill himself.\xe2\x80\x99 And there was Petronius, who had called\r\nhis friends about him at the last, bidding them talk to him, not of the\r\nconsolations of philosophy, but of love and gallantry, while the life\r\nwas ebbing away through his opened veins. Dipping his pen once more in\r\nthe ink he wrote on the last page of his diary: \xe2\x80\x98He died a Roman death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen, putting the toes of one foot into the water and finding that it\r\nwas not too hot, he threw off his dressing-gown and, taking a razor in\r\nhis hand, sat down in the bath. With one deep cut he severed the artery\r\nin his left wrist, then lay back and composed his mind to meditation.\r\nThe blood oozed out, floating through the water in dissolving wreaths\r\nand spirals. In a little while the whole bath was tinged with pink. The\r\ncolour deepened; Sir Hercules felt himself mastered by an invincible\r\ndrowsiness; he was sinking from vague dream to dream. Soon he was sound\r\nasleep. There was not much blood in his small body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nFor their after-luncheon coffee the party generally adjourned to the\r\nlibrary. Its windows looked east, and at this hour of the day it was the\r\ncoolest place in the whole house. It was a large room, fitted, during\r\nthe eighteenth century, with white painted shelves of an elegant design.\r\nIn the middle of one wall a door, ingeniously upholstered with rows\r\nof dummy books, gave access to a deep cupboard, where, among a pile of\r\nletter-files and old newspapers, the mummy-case of an Egyptian lady,\r\nbrought back by the second Sir Ferdinando on his return from the Grand\r\nTour, mouldered in the darkness. From ten yards away and at a first\r\nglance, one might almost have mistaken this secret door for a section of\r\nshelving filled with genuine books. Coffee-cup in hand, Mr. Scogan\r\nwas standing in front of the dummy book-shelf. Between the sips he\r\ndiscoursed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom shelf,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cis taken up by an Encyclopaedia in\r\nfourteen volumes. Useful, but a little dull, as is also Caprimulge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dictionary of the Finnish Language\xe2\x80\x99. The \xe2\x80\x98Biographical Dictionary\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlooks more promising. \xe2\x80\x98Biography of Men who were Born Great\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Biography\r\nof Men who Achieved Greatness\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Biography of Men who had Greatness\r\nThrust upon Them\xe2\x80\x99, and \xe2\x80\x98Biography of Men who were Never Great at All\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nThen there are ten volumes of \xe2\x80\x98Thom\xe2\x80\x99s Works and Wanderings\xe2\x80\x99, while the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wild Goose Chase, a Novel\xe2\x80\x99, by an anonymous author, fills no less\r\nthan six. But what\xe2\x80\x99s this, what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan stood on tiptoe and\r\npeered up. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven volumes of the \xe2\x80\x98Tales of Knockespotch\xe2\x80\x99. The \xe2\x80\x98Tales\r\nof Knockespotch\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning\r\nround, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are your best books. I would willingly give all the rest\r\nof your library for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe happy possessor of a multitude of first editions, Mr. Wimbush could\r\nafford to smile indulgently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they possess nothing more\r\nthan a back and a title?\xe2\x80\x9d He opened the cupboard door and peeped inside,\r\nas though he hoped to find the rest of the books behind it. \xe2\x80\x9cPhooh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, and shut the door again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt smells of dust and mildew. How\r\nsymbolical! One comes to the great masterpieces of the past, expecting\r\nsome miraculous illumination, and one finds, on opening them, only\r\ndarkness and dust and a faint smell of decay. After all, what is\r\nreading but a vice, like drink or venery or any other form of excessive\r\nself-indulgence? One reads to tickle and amuse one\xe2\x80\x99s mind; one\r\nreads, above all, to prevent oneself thinking. Still--the \xe2\x80\x98Tales of\r\nKnockespotch\xe2\x80\x99...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and thoughtfully drummed with his fingers on the backs of the\r\nnon-existent, unattainable books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I disagree with you about reading,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout serious\r\nreading, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, Mary, quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten\r\nthere were any serious people in the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the idea of the Biographies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s room for us\r\nall within the scheme; it\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Biographies are good, the Biographies are excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr\r\nScogan agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine them written in a very elegant Regency\r\nstyle--Brighton Pavilion in words--perhaps by the great Dr. Lempriere\r\nhimself. You know his classical dictionary? Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan raised his\r\nhand and let it limply fall again in a gesture which implied that words\r\nfailed him. \xe2\x80\x9cRead his biography of Helen; read how Jupiter, disguised\r\nas a swan, was \xe2\x80\x98enabled to avail himself of his situation\xe2\x80\x99 vis-a-vis to\r\nLeda. And to think that he may have, must have written these biographies\r\nof the Great! What a work, Henry! And, owing to the idiotic arrangement\r\nof your library, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer the \xe2\x80\x98Wild Goose Chase\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cA novel in six\r\nvolumes--it must be restful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRestful,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve hit on the right word. A \xe2\x80\x98Wild\r\nGoose Chase\xe2\x80\x99 is sound, but a bit old-fashioned--pictures of clerical\r\nlife in the fifties, you know; specimens of the landed gentry; peasants\r\nfor pathos and comedy; and in the background, always the picturesque\r\nbeauties of nature soberly described. All very good and solid, but, like\r\ncertain puddings, just a little dull. Personally, I like much better\r\nthe notion of \xe2\x80\x98Thom\xe2\x80\x99s Works and Wanderings\xe2\x80\x99. The eccentric Mr. Thom of\r\nThom\xe2\x80\x99s Hill. Old Tom Thom, as his intimates used to call him. He spent\r\nten years in Thibet organising the clarified butter industry on modern\r\nEuropean lines, and was able to retire at thirty-six with a handsome\r\nfortune. The rest of his life he devoted to travel and ratiocination;\r\nhere is the result.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan tapped the dummy books. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we come\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x98Tales of Knockespotch\xe2\x80\x99. What a masterpiece and what a great man!\r\nKnockespotch knew how to write fiction. Ah, Denis, if you could only\r\nread Knockespotch you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be writing a novel about the wearisome\r\ndevelopment of a young man\xe2\x80\x99s character, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be describing in\r\nendless, fastidious detail, cultured life in Chelsea and Bloomsbury and\r\nHampstead. You would be trying to write a readable book. But then, alas!\r\nowing to the peculiar arrangement of our host\xe2\x80\x99s library, you never will\r\nread Knockespotch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody could regret the fact more than I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Knockespotch,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great Knockespotch,\r\nwho delivered us from the dreary tyranny of the realistic novel. My\r\nlife, Knockespotch said, is not so long that I can afford to spend\r\nprecious hours writing or reading descriptions of middle-class\r\ninteriors. He said again, \xe2\x80\x98I am tired of seeing the human mind bogged in\r\na social plenum; I prefer to paint it in a vacuum, freely and sportively\r\nbombinating.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gombauld, \xe2\x80\x9cKnockespotch was a little obscure sometimes,\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand with intention. It made him seem even\r\nprofounder than he actually was. But it was only in his aphorisms that\r\nhe was so dark and oracular. In his Tales he was always luminous. Oh,\r\nthose Tales--those Tales! How shall I describe them? Fabulous characters\r\nshoot across his pages like gaily dressed performers on the trapeze.\r\nThere are extraordinary adventures and still more extraordinary\r\nspeculations. Intelligences and emotions, relieved of all the imbecile\r\npreoccupations of civilised life, move in intricate and subtle dances,\r\ncrossing and recrossing, advancing, retreating, impinging. An immense\r\nerudition and an immense fancy go hand in hand. All the ideas of the\r\npresent and of the past, on every possible subject, bob up among\r\nthe Tales, smile gravely or grimace a caricature of themselves, then\r\ndisappear to make place for something new. The verbal surface of his\r\nwriting is rich and fantastically diversified. The wit is incessant.\r\nThe...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you give us a specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis broke in--\xe2\x80\x9ca concrete\r\nexample?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cKnockespotch\xe2\x80\x99s great book is like the sword\r\nExcalibur. It remains struck fast in this door, awaiting the coming of a\r\nwriter with genius enough to draw it forth. I am not even a writer, I\r\nam not so much as qualified to attempt the task. The extraction of\r\nKnockespotch from his wooden prison I leave, my dear Denis, to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the amiable Brantome,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cevery\r\ndebutante at the French Court was invited to dine at the King\xe2\x80\x99s table,\r\nwhere she was served with wine in a handsome silver cup of Italian\r\nworkmanship. It was no ordinary cup, this goblet of the debutantes;\r\nfor, inside, it had been most curiously and ingeniously engraved with a\r\nseries of very lively amorous scenes. With each draught that the young\r\nlady swallowed these engravings became increasingly visible, and the\r\nCourt looked on with interest, every time she put her nose in the cup,\r\nto see whether she blushed at what the ebbing wine revealed. If the\r\ndebutante blushed, they laughed at her for her innocence; if she did\r\nnot, she was laughed at for being too knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you propose,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the custom should be revived at\r\nBuckingham Palace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cI merely quoted the anecdote as an\r\nillustration of the customs, so genially frank, of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. I might have quoted other anecdotes to show that the customs\r\nof the seventeenth and eighteenth, of the fifteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, and indeed of every other century, from the time of Hammurabi\r\nonward, were equally genial and equally frank. The only century in which\r\ncustoms were not characterised by the same cheerful openness was the\r\nnineteenth, of blessed memory. It was the astonishing exception. And\r\nyet, with what one must suppose was a deliberate disregard of history,\r\nit looked upon its horribly pregnant silences as normal and natural and\r\nright; the frankness of the previous fifteen or twenty thousand years\r\nwas considered abnormal and perverse. It was a curious phenomenon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entirely agree.\xe2\x80\x9d Mary panted with excitement in her effort to bring\r\nout what she had to say. \xe2\x80\x9cHavelock Ellis says...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan, like a policeman arresting the flow of traffic, held up his\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does; I know. And that brings me to my next point: the nature\r\nof the reaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHavelock Ellis...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reaction, when it came--and we may say roughly that it set in\r\na little before the beginning of this century--the reaction was to\r\nopenness, but not to the same openness as had reigned in the earlier\r\nages. It was to a scientific openness, not to the jovial frankness\r\nof the past, that we returned. The whole question of Amour became a\r\nterribly serious one. Earnest young men wrote in the public prints that\r\nfrom this time forth it would be impossible ever again to make a joke\r\nof any sexual matter. Professors wrote thick books in which sex was\r\nsterilised and dissected. It has become customary for serious young\r\nwomen, like Mary, to discuss, with philosophic calm, matters of which\r\nthe merest hint would have sufficed to throw the youth of the sixties\r\ninto a delirium of amorous excitement. It is all very estimable, no\r\ndoubt. But still\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Scogan sighed.--\xe2\x80\x9cI for one should like to see,\r\nmingled with this scientific ardour, a little more of the jovial spirit\r\nof Rabelais and Chaucer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entirely disagree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cSex isn\xe2\x80\x99t a laughing matter;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Scogan, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m an obscene old man. For I\r\nmust confess that I cannot always regard it as wholly serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you...\xe2\x80\x9d began Mary furiously. Her face had flushed with\r\nexcitement. Her cheeks were the cheeks of a great ripe peach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to me one of few permanently\r\nand everlastingly amusing subjects that exist. Amour is the one human\r\nactivity of any importance in which laughter and pleasure preponderate,\r\nif ever so slightly, over misery and pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entirely disagree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. There was a silence.\r\n\r\nAnne looked at her watch. \xe2\x80\x9cNearly a quarter to eight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder when Ivor will turn up.\xe2\x80\x9d She got up from her deck-chair and,\r\nleaning her elbows on the balustrade of the terrace, looked out over the\r\nvalley and towards the farther hills. Under the level evening light the\r\narchitecture of the land revealed itself. The deep shadows, the bright\r\ncontrasting lights gave the hills a new solidity. Irregularities of the\r\nsurface, unsuspected before, were picked out with light and shade.\r\nThe grass, the corn, the foliage of trees were stippled with intricate\r\nshadows. The surface of things had taken on a marvellous enrichment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne suddenly, and pointed. On the opposite side of the\r\nvalley, at the crest of the ridge, a cloud of dust flushed by the\r\nsunlight to rosy gold was moving rapidly along the sky-line. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Ivor.\r\nOne can tell by the speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dust cloud descended into the valley and was lost. A horn with the\r\nvoice of a sea-lion made itself heard, approaching. A minute later Ivor\r\ncame leaping round the corner of the house. His hair waved in the wind\r\nof his own speed; he laughed as he saw them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and embraced her, embraced Mary, very nearly\r\nembraced Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, here I am. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come with incredulous\r\nspeed.\xe2\x80\x9d Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary was rich, but a little erratic. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not late\r\nfor dinner, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d He hoisted himself up on to the balustrade, and\r\nsat there, kicking his heels. With one arm he embraced a large stone\r\nflower-pot, leaning his head sideways against its hard and lichenous\r\nflanks in an attitude of trustful affection. He had brown, wavy hair,\r\nand his eyes were of a very brilliant, pale, improbable blue. His head\r\nwas narrow, his face thin and rather long, his nose aquiline. In old\r\nage--though it was difficult to imagine Ivor old--he might grow to have\r\nan Iron Ducal grimness. But now, at twenty-six, it was not the structure\r\nof his face that impressed one; it was its expression. That was charming\r\nand vivacious, and his smile was an irradiation. He was forever moving,\r\nrestlessly and rapidly, but with an engaging gracefulness. His frail and\r\nslender body seemed to be fed by a spring of inexhaustible energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re not late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in time to answer a question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were arguing\r\nwhether Amour were a serious matter or no. What do you think? Is it\r\nserious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerious?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Ivor. \xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in what sense serious?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean as an occupation. One can go on with it without ever getting\r\nbored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can occupy oneself with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivor continued, \xe2\x80\x9calways and\r\neverywhere. Women are always wonderfully the same. Shapes vary a little,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. In Spain\xe2\x80\x9d--with his free hand he described a series of ample\r\ncurves--\xe2\x80\x9cone can\xe2\x80\x99t pass them on the stairs. In England\xe2\x80\x9d--he put the tip\r\nof his forefinger against the tip of his thumb and, lowering his hand,\r\ndrew out this circle into an imaginary cylinder--\xe2\x80\x9cIn England they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntubular. But their sentiments are always the same. At least, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\nfound it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThe ladies had left the room and the port was circulating. Mr. Scogan\r\nfilled his glass, passed on the decanter, and, leaning back in his\r\nchair, looked about him for a moment in silence. The conversation\r\nrippled idly round him, but he disregarded it; he was smiling at some\r\nprivate joke. Gombauld noticed his smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s amusing you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just looking at you all, sitting round this table,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nScogan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we as comic as all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan answered politely. \xe2\x80\x9cI was merely amused by my\r\nown speculations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what were they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idlest, the most academic of speculations. I was looking at you one\r\nby one and trying to imagine which of the first six Caesars you would\r\neach resemble, if you were given the opportunity of behaving like a\r\nCaesar. The Caesars are one of my touchstones,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan explained.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are characters functioning, so to speak, in the void. They\r\nare human beings developed to their logical conclusions. Hence their\r\nunequalled value as a touchstone, a standard. When I meet someone\r\nfor the first time, I ask myself this question: Given the Caesarean\r\nenvironment, which of the Caesars would this person resemble--Julius,\r\nAugustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero? I take each trait of\r\ncharacter, each mental and emotional bias, each little oddity, and\r\nmagnify them a thousand times. The resulting image gives me his\r\nCaesarean formula.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd which of the Caesars do you resemble?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gombauld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am potentially all of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan replied, \xe2\x80\x9call--with the\r\npossible exception of Claudius, who was much too stupid to be a\r\ndevelopment of anything in my character. The seeds of Julius\xe2\x80\x99s courage\r\nand compelling energy, of Augustus\xe2\x80\x99s prudence, of the libidinousness and\r\ncruelty of Tiberius, of Caligula\xe2\x80\x99s folly, of Nero\xe2\x80\x99s artistic genius and\r\nenormous vanity, are all within me. Given the opportunities, I might\r\nhave been something fabulous. But circumstances were against me. I was\r\nborn and brought up in a country rectory; I passed my youth doing a\r\ngreat deal of utterly senseless hard work for a very little money. The\r\nresult is that now, in middle age, I am the poor thing that I am. But\r\nperhaps it is as well. Perhaps, too, it\xe2\x80\x99s as well that Denis hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen permitted to flower into a little Nero, and that Ivor remains only\r\npotentially a Caligula. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s better so, no doubt. But it would\r\nhave been more amusing, as a spectacle, if they had had the chance to\r\ndevelop, untrammelled, the full horror of their potentialities. It would\r\nhave been pleasant and interesting to watch their tics and foibles and\r\nlittle vices swelling and burgeoning and blossoming into enormous and\r\nfantastic flowers of cruelty and pride and lewdness and avarice. The\r\nCaesarean environment makes the Caesar, as the special food and the\r\nqueenly cell make the queen bee. We differ from the bees in so far that,\r\ngiven the proper food, they can be sure of making a queen every time.\r\nWith us there is no such certainty; out of every ten men placed in the\r\nCaesarean environment one will be temperamentally good, or intelligent,\r\nor great. The rest will blossom into Caesars; he will not. Seventy and\r\neighty years ago simple-minded people, reading of the exploits of the\r\nBourbons in South Italy, cried out in amazement: To think that such\r\nthings should be happening in the nineteenth century! And a few years\r\nsince we too were astonished to find that in our still more astonishing\r\ntwentieth century, unhappy blackamoors on the Congo and the Amazon were\r\nbeing treated as English serfs were treated in the time of Stephen.\r\nTo-day we are no longer surprised at these things. The Black and Tans\r\nharry Ireland, the Poles maltreat the Silesians, the bold Fascisti\r\nslaughter their poorer countrymen: we take it all for granted. Since the\r\nwar we wonder at nothing. We have created a Caesarean environment and a\r\nhost of little Caesars has sprung up. What could be more natural?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan drank off what was left of his port and refilled the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this very moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most frightful horrors are taking\r\nplace in every corner of the world. People are being crushed, slashed,\r\ndisembowelled, mangled; their dead bodies rot and their eyes decay with\r\nthe rest. Screams of pain and fear go pulsing through the air at the\r\nrate of eleven hundred feet per second. After travelling for three\r\nseconds they are perfectly inaudible. These are distressing facts; but\r\ndo we enjoy life any the less because of them? Most certainly we do not.\r\nWe feel sympathy, no doubt; we represent to ourselves imaginatively the\r\nsufferings of nations and individuals and we deplore them. But, after\r\nall, what are sympathy and imagination? Precious little, unless the\r\nperson for whom we feel sympathy happens to be closely involved in our\r\naffections; and even then they don\xe2\x80\x99t go very far. And a good thing too;\r\nfor if one had an imagination vivid enough and a sympathy sufficiently\r\nsensitive really to comprehend and to feel the sufferings of other\r\npeople, one would never have a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace of mind. A really\r\nsympathetic race would not so much as know the meaning of happiness.\r\nBut luckily, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve already said, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t a sympathetic race. At\r\nthe beginning of the war I used to think I really suffered, through\r\nimagination and sympathy, with those who physically suffered. But after\r\na month or two I had to admit that, honestly, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And yet I\r\nthink I have a more vivid imagination than most. One is always alone in\r\nsuffering; the fact is depressing when one happens to be the sufferer,\r\nbut it makes pleasure possible for the rest of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Henry Wimbush pushed back his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think perhaps we ought to go and join the ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivor, jumping up with alacrity. He turned to Mr. Scogan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can share our pleasures. We are not always\r\ncondemned to be happy alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nIvor brought his hands down with a bang on to the final chord of his\r\nrhapsody. There was just a hint in that triumphant harmony that the\r\nseventh had been struck along with the octave by the thumb of the left\r\nhand; but the general effect of splendid noise emerged clearly enough.\r\nSmall details matter little so long as the general effect is good. And,\r\nbesides, that hint of the seventh was decidedly modern. He turned round\r\nin his seat and tossed the hair back out of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the best I can do for you, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMurmurs of applause and gratitude were heard, and Mary, her large china\r\neyes fixed on the performer, cried out aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cWonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d and gasped\r\nfor new breath as though she were suffocating.\r\n\r\nNature and fortune had vied with one another in heaping on Ivor\r\nLombard all their choicest gifts. He had wealth and he was perfectly\r\nindependent. He was good looking, possessed an irresistible charm of\r\nmanner, and was the hero of more amorous successes than he could well\r\nremember. His accomplishments were extraordinary for their number and\r\nvariety. He had a beautiful untrained tenor voice; he could improvise,\r\nwith a startling brilliance, rapidly and loudly, on the piano. He was a\r\ngood amateur medium and telepathist, and had a considerable first-hand\r\nknowledge of the next world. He could write rhymed verses with an\r\nextraordinary rapidity. For painting symbolical pictures he had a\r\ndashing style, and if the drawing was sometimes a little weak, the\r\ncolour was always pyrotechnical. He excelled in amateur theatricals\r\nand, when occasion offered, he could cook with genius. He resembled\r\nShakespeare in knowing little Latin and less Greek. For a mind like his,\r\neducation seemed supererogatory. Training would only have destroyed his\r\nnatural aptitudes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go out into the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivor suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I for one prefer these still more\r\nwonderful arm-chairs.\xe2\x80\x9d His pipe had begun to bubble oozily every time he\r\npulled at it. He was perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush was also happy. He looked for a moment over his pince-nez\r\nin Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s direction and then, without saying anything, returned to\r\nthe grimy little sixteenth-century account books which were now his\r\nfavourite reading. He knew more about Sir Ferdinando\xe2\x80\x99s household\r\nexpenses than about his own.\r\n\r\nThe outdoor party, enrolled under Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s banner, consisted of Anne,\r\nMary, Denis, and, rather unexpectedly, Jenny. Outside it was warm and\r\ndark; there was no moon. They walked up and down the terrace, and Ivor\r\nsang a Neapolitan song: \xe2\x80\x9cStretti, stretti\xe2\x80\x9d--close, close--with something\r\nabout the little Spanish girl to follow. The atmosphere began to\r\npalpitate. Ivor put his arm round Anne\xe2\x80\x99s waist, dropped his head\r\nsideways onto her shoulder, and in that position walked on, singing as\r\nhe walked. It seemed the easiest, the most natural, thing in the world.\r\nDenis wondered why he had never done it. He hated Ivor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go down to the pool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivor. He disengaged his embrace and\r\nturned round to shepherd his little flock. They made their way along the\r\nside of the house to the entrance of the yew-tree walk that led down to\r\nthe lower garden. Between the blank precipitous wall of the house and\r\nthe tall yew trees the path was a chasm of impenetrable gloom. Somewhere\r\nthere were steps down to the right, a gap in the yew hedge. Denis, who\r\nheaded the party, groped his way cautiously; in this darkness, one\r\nhad an irrational fear of yawning precipices, of horrible spiked\r\nobstructions. Suddenly from behind him he heard a shrill, startled,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and then a sharp, dry concussion that might have been the sound\r\nof a slap. After that, Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard pronouncing, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going\r\nback to the house.\xe2\x80\x9d Her tone was decided, and even as she pronounced the\r\nwords she was melting away into the darkness. The incident, whatever it\r\nhad been, was closed. Denis resumed his forward groping. From somewhere\r\nbehind Ivor began to sing again, softly:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cPhillis plus avare que tendre\r\n\r\n               Ne gagnant rien \xc3\xa0 refuser,\r\n\r\n               Un jour exigea \xc3\xa0 Silvandre\r\n\r\n               Trente moutons pour un baiser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe melody drooped and climbed again with a kind of easy languor; the\r\nwarm darkness seemed to pulse like blood about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cLe lendemain, nouvelle affaire:\r\n\r\n               Pour le berger le troc fut bon...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are the steps,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Denis. He guided his companions over the\r\ndanger, and in a moment they had the turf of the yew-tree walk under\r\ntheir feet. It was lighter here, or at least it was just perceptibly\r\nless dark; for the yew walk was wider than the path that had led them\r\nunder the lea of the house. Looking up, they could see between the high\r\nblack hedges a strip of sky and a few stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cCar il obtint de la bergere...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWent on Ivor, and then interrupted himself to shout, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to run\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was off, full speed, down the invisible slope, singing\r\nunevenly as he went:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cTrente baisers pour un mouton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others followed. Denis shambled in the rear, vainly exhorting\r\neveryone to caution: the slope was steep, one might break one\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\nWhat was wrong with these people, he wondered? They had become like\r\nyoung kittens after a dose of cat-nip. He himself felt a certain\r\nkittenishness sporting within him; but it was, like all his emotions,\r\nrather a theoretical feeling; it did not overmasteringly seek to express\r\nitself in a practical demonstration of kittenishness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted once more, and hardly were the words out of his\r\nmouth when, thump! there was the sound of a heavy fall in front of\r\nhim, followed by the long \xe2\x80\x9cF-f-f-f-f\xe2\x80\x9d of a breath indrawn with pain and\r\nafterwards by a very sincere, \xe2\x80\x9cOo-ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d Denis was almost pleased; he had\r\ntold them so, the idiots, and they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen. He trotted down the\r\nslope towards the unseen sufferer.\r\n\r\nMary came down the hill like a runaway steam-engine. It was tremendously\r\nexciting, this blind rush through the dark; she felt she would never\r\nstop. But the ground grew level beneath her feet, her speed insensibly\r\nslackened, and suddenly she was caught by an extended arm and brought to\r\nan abrupt halt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivor as he tightened his embrace, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re caught now,\r\nAnne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made an effort to release herself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not Anne. It\xe2\x80\x99s Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvor burst into a peal of amused laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it is!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nseem to be making nothing but floaters this evening. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already made\r\none with Jenny.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed again, and there was something so jolly\r\nabout his laughter that Mary could not help laughing too. He did not\r\nremove his encircling arm, and somehow it was all so amusing and natural\r\nthat Mary made no further attempt to escape from it. They walked along\r\nby the side of the pool, interlaced. Mary was too short for him to be\r\nable, with any comfort, to lay his head on her shoulder. He rubbed his\r\ncheek, caressed and caressing, against the thick, sleek mass of her\r\nhair. In a little while he began to sing again; the night trembled\r\namorously to the sound of his voice. When he had finished he kissed her.\r\nAnne or Mary: Mary or Anne. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make much difference which\r\nit was. There were differences in detail, of course; but the general\r\neffect was the same; and, after all, the general effect was the\r\nimportant thing.\r\n\r\nDenis made his way down the hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny damage done?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Denis? I\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt my ankle so--and my knee, and my hand.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m all in pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then,\xe2\x80\x9d he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help adding, \xe2\x80\x9cit was\r\nsilly to start running downhill in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAss!\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted in a tone of tearful irritation; \xe2\x80\x9cof course it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down beside her on the grass, and found himself breathing the faint,\r\ndelicious atmosphere of perfume that she carried always with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight a match,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to look at my wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt in his pockets for the match-box. The light spurted and then\r\ngrew steady. Magically, a little universe had been created, a world of\r\ncolours and forms--Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face, the shimmering orange of her dress, her\r\nwhite, bare arms, a patch of green turf--and round about a darkness that\r\nhad become solid and utterly blind. Anne held out her hands; both were\r\ngreen and earthy with her fall, and the left exhibited two or three red\r\nabrasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. But Denis was terribly distressed, and his\r\nemotion was intensified when, looking up at her face, he saw that the\r\ntrace of tears, involuntary tears of pain, lingered on her eyelashes.\r\nHe pulled out his handkerchief and began to wipe away the dirt from\r\nthe wounded hand. The match went out; it was not worth while to light\r\nanother. Anne allowed herself to be attended to, meekly and gratefully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when he had finished cleaning and bandaging her\r\nhand; and there was something in her tone that made him feel that she\r\nhad lost her superiority over him, that she was younger than he,\r\nhad become, suddenly, almost a child. He felt tremendously large and\r\nprotective. The feeling was so strong that instinctively he put his\r\narm about her. She drew closer, leaned against him, and so they sat in\r\nsilence. Then, from below, soft but wonderfully clear through the still\r\ndarkness, they heard the sound of Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s singing. He was going on with\r\nhis half-finished song:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cLe lendemain Phillis plus tendre,\r\n\r\n               Ne voulant deplaire au berger,\r\n\r\n               Fut trop heureuse de lui rendre\r\n\r\n               Trente moutons pour un baiser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a rather prolonged pause. It was as though time were being\r\nallowed for the giving and receiving of a few of those thirty kisses.\r\nThen the voice sang on:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cLe lendemain Phillis peu sage\r\n\r\n               Aurait donne moutons et chien\r\n\r\n               Pour un baiser que le volage\r\n\r\n               \xc3\x80 Lisette donnait pour rien.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last note died away into an uninterrupted silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you better?\xe2\x80\x9d Denis whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you comfortable like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded a Yes to both questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrente moutons pour un baiser.\xe2\x80\x9d The sheep, the woolly mutton--baa,\r\nbaa, baa...? Or the shepherd? Yes, decidedly, he felt himself to be\r\nthe shepherd now. He was the master, the protector. A wave of courage\r\nswelled through him, warm as wine. He turned his head, and began to kiss\r\nher face, at first rather randomly, then, with more precision, on the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nAnne averted her head; he kissed the ear, the smooth nape that this\r\nmovement presented him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested; \xe2\x80\x9cno, Denis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt spoils our friendship, and that was so jolly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBosh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis.\r\n\r\nShe tried to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t...it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nour stunt at all.\xe2\x80\x9d It was true. Somehow she had never thought of Denis\r\nin the light of a man who might make love; she had never so much as\r\nconceived the possibilities of an amorous relationship with him. He was\r\nso absurdly young, so...so...she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the adjective, but she\r\nknew what she meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy isn\xe2\x80\x99t it our stunt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by the way, that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhorrible and inappropriate expression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I say it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes no difference. I say it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall make you say it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Denis. But you must do it another time. I must go in and get\r\nmy ankle into hot water. It\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to swell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReasons of health could not be gainsaid. Denis got up reluctantly, and\r\nhelped his companion to her feet. She took a cautious step. \xe2\x80\x9cOoh!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhalted and leaned heavily on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll carry you,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis offered. He had never tried to carry a woman,\r\nbut on the cinema it always looked an easy piece of heroism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt larger and more protective than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cPut\r\nyour arms round my neck,\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered. She did so and, stooping, he\r\npicked her up under the knees and lifted her from the ground. Good\r\nheavens, what a weight! He took five staggering steps up the slope, then\r\nalmost lost his equilibrium, and had to deposit his burden suddenly,\r\nwith something of a bump.\r\n\r\nAnne was shaking with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cI said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, my poor Denis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, without conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly sweet of you to offer, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather walk, thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlaid her hand on his shoulder and, thus supported, began to limp slowly\r\nup the hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Denis!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, and laughed again. Humiliated, he was\r\nsilent. It seemed incredible that, only two minutes ago, he should\r\nhave been holding her in his embrace, kissing her. Incredible. She was\r\nhelpless then, a child. Now she had regained all her superiority; she\r\nwas once more the far-off being, desired and unassailable. Why had he\r\nbeen such a fool as to suggest that carrying stunt? He reached the house\r\nin a state of the profoundest depression.\r\n\r\nHe helped Anne upstairs, left her in the hands of a maid, and came down\r\nagain to the drawing-room. He was surprised to find them all sitting\r\njust where he had left them. He had expected that, somehow, everything\r\nwould be quite different--it seemed such a prodigious time since he went\r\naway. All silent and all damned, he reflected, as he looked at them. Mr.\r\nScogan\xe2\x80\x99s pipe still wheezed; that was the only sound. Henry Wimbush was\r\nstill deep in his account books; he had just made the discovery that Sir\r\nFerdinando was in the habit of eating oysters the whole summer through,\r\nregardless of the absence of the justifying R. Gombauld, in horn-rimmed\r\nspectacles, was reading. Jenny was mysteriously scribbling in her red\r\nnotebook. And, seated in her favourite arm-chair at the corner of the\r\nhearth, Priscilla was looking through a pile of drawings. One by one she\r\nheld them out at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length and, throwing back her mountainous orange\r\nhead, looked long and attentively through half-closed eyelids. She wore\r\na pale sea-green dress; on the slope of her mauve-powdered decolletage\r\ndiamonds twinkled. An immensely long cigarette-holder projected at an\r\nangle from her face. Diamonds were embedded in her high-piled\r\ncoiffure; they glittered every time she moved. It was a batch of Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawings--sketches of Spirit Life, made in the course of tranced tours\r\nthrough the other world. On the back of each sheet descriptive titles\r\nwere written: \xe2\x80\x9cPortrait of an Angel, 15th March \xe2\x80\x9820;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAstral Beings\r\nat Play, 3rd December \xe2\x80\x9819;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA Party of Souls on their Way to a Higher\r\nSphere, 21st May \xe2\x80\x9821.\xe2\x80\x9d Before examining the drawing on the obverse of\r\neach sheet, she turned it over to read the title. Try as she could--and\r\nshe tried hard--Priscilla had never seen a vision or succeeded in\r\nestablishing any communication with the Spirit World. She had to be\r\ncontent with the reported experiences of others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done with the rest of your party?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, looking up\r\nas Denis entered the room.\r\n\r\nHe explained. Anne had gone to bed, Ivor and Mary were still in the\r\ngarden. He selected a book and a comfortable chair, and tried, as far as\r\nthe disturbed state of his mind would permit him, to compose himself\r\nfor an evening\xe2\x80\x99s reading. The lamplight was utterly serene; there was no\r\nmovement save the stir of Priscilla among her papers. All silent and all\r\ndamned, Denis repeated to himself, all silent and all damned...\r\n\r\nIt was nearly an hour later when Ivor and Mary made their appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe waited to see the moon rise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was gibbous, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary explained, very technical and\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so beautiful down in the garden! The trees, the scent of the\r\nflowers, the stars...\xe2\x80\x9d Ivor waved his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when the moon came up,\r\nit was really too much. It made me burst into tears.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat down at the\r\npiano and opened the lid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were a great many meteorites,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary to anyone who would\r\nlisten. \xe2\x80\x9cThe earth must just be coming into the summer shower of them.\r\nIn July and August...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ivor had already begun to strike the keys. He played the garden,\r\nthe stars, the scent of flowers, the rising moon. He even put in a\r\nnightingale that was not there. Mary looked on and listened with parted\r\nlips. The others pursued their occupations, without appearing to be\r\nseriously disturbed. On this very July day, exactly three hundred and\r\nfifty years ago, Sir Ferdinando had eaten seven dozen oysters. The\r\ndiscovery of this fact gave Henry Wimbush a peculiar pleasure. He had\r\na natural piety which made him delight in the celebration of memorial\r\nfeasts. The three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the seven dozen\r\noysters...He wished he had known before dinner; he would have ordered\r\nchampagne.\r\n\r\nOn her way to bed Mary paid a call. The light was out in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nbut she was not yet asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come down to the garden with us?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fell down and twisted my ankle. Denis helped me home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was full of sympathy. Inwardly, too, she was relieved to find\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s non-appearance so simply accounted for. She had been vaguely\r\nsuspicious, down there in the garden--suspicious of what, she hardly\r\nknew; but there had seemed to be something a little louche in the way\r\nshe had suddenly found herself alone with Ivor. Not that she minded, of\r\ncourse; far from it. But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea that perhaps she was\r\nthe victim of a put-up job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be better to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and she commiserated\r\nwith Anne on all she had missed--the garden, the stars, the scent of\r\nflowers, the meteorites through whose summer shower the earth was now\r\npassing, the rising moon and its gibbosity. And then they had had such\r\ninteresting conversation. What about? About almost everything. Nature,\r\nart, science, poetry, the stars, spiritualism, the relations of the\r\nsexes, music, religion. Ivor, she thought, had an interesting mind.\r\n\r\nThe two young ladies parted affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe nearest Roman Catholic church was upwards of twenty miles away.\r\nIvor, who was punctilious in his devotions, came down early to breakfast\r\nand had his car at the door, ready to start, by a quarter to ten. It was\r\na smart, expensive-looking machine, enamelled a pure lemon yellow and\r\nupholstered in emerald green leather. There were two seats--three if you\r\nsqueezed tightly enough--and their occupants were protected from\r\nwind, dust, and weather by a glazed sedan that rose, an elegant\r\neighteenth-century hump, from the midst of the body of the car.\r\n\r\nMary had never been to a Roman Catholic service, thought it would be an\r\ninteresting experience, and, when the car moved off through the great\r\ngates of the courtyard, she was occupying the spare seat in the sedan.\r\nThe sea-lion horn roared, faintlier, faintlier, and they were gone.\r\n\r\nIn the parish church of Crome Mr. Bodiham preached on 1 Kings vi. 18:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the cedar of the house within was carved with knops\xe2\x80\x9d--a sermon of\r\nimmediately local interest. For the past two years the problem of the\r\nWar Memorial had exercised the minds of all those in Crome who had\r\nenough leisure, or mental energy, or party spirit to think of such\r\nthings. Henry Wimbush was all for a library--a library of local\r\nliterature, stocked with county histories, old maps of the district,\r\nmonographs on the local antiquities, dialect dictionaries, handbooks\r\nof the local geology and natural history. He liked to think of the\r\nvillagers, inspired by such reading, making up parties of a Sunday\r\nafternoon to look for fossils and flint arrow-heads. The villagers\r\nthemselves favoured the idea of a memorial reservoir and water supply.\r\nBut the busiest and most articulate party followed Mr. Bodiham in\r\ndemanding something religious in character--a second lich-gate, for\r\nexample, a stained-glass window, a monument of marble, or, if possible,\r\nall three. So far, however, nothing had been done, partly because the\r\nmemorial committee had never been able to agree, partly for the more\r\ncogent reason that too little money had been subscribed to carry out any\r\nof the proposed schemes. Every three or four months Mr. Bodiham preached\r\na sermon on the subject. His last had been delivered in March; it was\r\nhigh time that his congregation had a fresh reminder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the cedar of the house within was carved with knops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bodiham touched lightly on Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s temple. From thence he passed\r\nto temples and churches in general. What were the characteristics of\r\nthese buildings dedicated to God? Obviously, the fact of their, from\r\na human point of view, complete uselessness. They were unpractical\r\nbuildings \xe2\x80\x9ccarved with knops.\xe2\x80\x9d Solomon might have built a\r\nlibrary--indeed, what could be more to the taste of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wisest\r\nman? He might have dug a reservoir--what more useful in a parched city\r\nlike Jerusalem? He did neither; he built a house all carved with knops,\r\nuseless and unpractical. Why? Because he was dedicating the work to God.\r\nThere had been much talk in Crome about the proposed War Memorial. A\r\nWar Memorial was, in its very nature, a work dedicated to God. It was a\r\ntoken of thankfulness that the first stage in the culminating world-war\r\nhad been crowned by the triumph of righteousness; it was at the same\r\ntime a visibly embodied supplication that God might not long delay the\r\nAdvent which alone could bring the final peace. A library, a reservoir?\r\nMr. Bodiham scornfully and indignantly condemned the idea. These were\r\nworks dedicated to man, not to God. As a War Memorial they were totally\r\nunsuitable. A lich-gate had been suggested. This was an object which\r\nanswered perfectly to the definition of a War Memorial: a useless work\r\ndedicated to God and carved with knops. One lich-gate, it was true,\r\nalready existed. But nothing would be easier than to make a second\r\nentrance into the churchyard; and a second entrance would need a second\r\ngate. Other suggestions had been made. Stained-glass windows, a monument\r\nof marble. Both these were admirable, especially the latter. It was high\r\ntime that the War Memorial was erected. It might soon be too late.\r\nAt any moment, like a thief in the night, God might come. Meanwhile a\r\ndifficulty stood in the way. Funds were inadequate. All should subscribe\r\naccording to their means. Those who had lost relations in the war might\r\nreasonably be expected to subscribe a sum equal to that which they would\r\nhave had to pay in funeral expenses if the relative had died while at\r\nhome. Further delay was disastrous. The War Memorial must be built at\r\nonce. He appealed to the patriotism and the Christian sentiments of all\r\nhis hearers.\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush walked home thinking of the books he would present to the\r\nWar Memorial Library, if ever it came into existence. He took the path\r\nthrough the fields; it was pleasanter than the road. At the first\r\nstile a group of village boys, loutish young fellows all dressed in the\r\nhideous ill-fitting black which makes a funeral of every English Sunday\r\nand holiday, were assembled, drearily guffawing as they smoked their\r\ncigarettes. They made way for Henry Wimbush, touching their caps as he\r\npassed. He returned their salute; his bowler and face were one in their\r\nunruffled gravity.\r\n\r\nIn Sir Ferdinando\xe2\x80\x99s time, he reflected, in the time of his son, Sir\r\nJulius, these young men would have had their Sunday diversions even at\r\nCrome, remote and rustic Crome. There would have been archery, skittles,\r\ndancing--social amusements in which they would have partaken as members\r\nof a conscious community. Now they had nothing, nothing except Mr.\r\nBodiham\xe2\x80\x99s forbidding Boys\xe2\x80\x99 Club and the rare dances and concerts\r\norganised by himself. Boredom or the urban pleasures of the county\r\nmetropolis were the alternatives that presented themselves to these poor\r\nyouths. Country pleasures were no more; they had been stamped out by the\r\nPuritans.\r\n\r\nIn Manningham\xe2\x80\x99s Diary for 1600 there was a queer passage, he remembered,\r\na very queer passage. Certain magistrates in Berkshire, Puritan\r\nmagistrates, had had wind of a scandal. One moonlit summer night they\r\nhad ridden out with their posse and there, among the hills, they had\r\ncome upon a company of men and women, dancing, stark naked, among the\r\nsheepcotes. The magistrates and their men had ridden their horses into\r\nthe crowd. How self-conscious the poor people must suddenly have felt,\r\nhow helpless without their clothes against armed and booted horsemen!\r\nThe dancers were arrested, whipped, gaoled, set in the stocks; the\r\nmoonlight dance is never danced again. What old, earthy, Panic rite came\r\nto extinction here? he wondered. Who knows?--perhaps their ancestors had\r\ndanced like this in the moonlight ages before Adam and Eve were so much\r\nas thought of. He liked to think so. And now it was no more. These weary\r\nyoung men, if they wanted to dance, would have to bicycle six miles to\r\nthe town. The country was desolate, without life of its own, without\r\nindigenous pleasures. The pious magistrates had snuffed out for ever a\r\nlittle happy flame that had burned from the beginning of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as on Tullia\xe2\x80\x99s tomb one lamp burned clear,\r\n\r\n               Unchanged for fifteen hundred year...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated the lines to himself, and was desolated to think of all the\r\nmurdered past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s long cigar burned aromatically. The \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Crome\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n lay on his knee; slowly he turned over the pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t decide what episode to read you to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Ferdinando\xe2\x80\x99s voyages are not without interest. Then,\r\nof course, there\xe2\x80\x99s his son, Sir Julius. It was he who suffered from the\r\ndelusion that his perspiration engendered flies; it drove him finally to\r\nsuicide. Or there\xe2\x80\x99s Sir Cyprian.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned the pages more rapidly. \xe2\x80\x9cOr\r\nSir Henry. Or Sir George...No, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to think I won\xe2\x80\x99t read about\r\nany of these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must read something,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Mr. Scogan, taking his pipe out\r\nof his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall read about my grandfather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthe events that led up to his marriage with the eldest daughter of the\r\nlast Sir Ferdinando.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I begin reading,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush, looking up from the\r\nbook and taking off the pince-nez which he had just fitted to his\r\nnose--\xe2\x80\x9cbefore I begin, I must say a few preliminary words about Sir\r\nFerdinando, the last of the Lapiths. At the death of the virtuous and\r\nunfortunate Sir Hercules, Ferdinando found himself in possession of the\r\nfamily fortune, not a little increased by his father\xe2\x80\x99s temperance and\r\nthrift; he applied himself forthwith to the task of spending it, which\r\nhe did in an ample and jovial fashion. By the time he was forty he had\r\neaten and, above all, drunk and loved away about half his capital, and\r\nwould infallibly have soon got rid of the rest in the same manner, if\r\nhe had not had the good fortune to become so madly enamoured of the\r\nRector\xe2\x80\x99s daughter as to make a proposal of marriage. The young lady\r\naccepted him, and in less than a year had become the absolute mistress\r\nof Crome and her husband. An extraordinary reformation made itself\r\napparent in Sir Ferdinando\xe2\x80\x99s character. He grew regular and economical\r\nin his habits; he even became temperate, rarely drinking more than\r\na bottle and a half of port at a sitting. The waning fortune of the\r\nLapiths began once more to wax, and that in despite of the hard times\r\n(for Sir Ferdinando married in 1809 in the height of the Napoleonic\r\nWars). A prosperous and dignified old age, cheered by the spectacle of\r\nhis children\xe2\x80\x99s growth and happiness--for Lady Lapith had already borne\r\nhim three daughters, and there seemed no good reason why she should not\r\nbear many more of them, and sons as well--a patriarchal decline into the\r\nfamily vault, seemed now to be Sir Ferdinando\xe2\x80\x99s enviable destiny. But\r\nProvidence willed otherwise. To Napoleon, cause already of such infinite\r\nmischief, was due, though perhaps indirectly, the untimely and violent\r\ndeath which put a period to this reformed existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Ferdinando, who was above all things a patriot, had adopted, from\r\nthe earliest days of the conflict with the French, his own peculiar\r\nmethod of celebrating our victories. When the happy news reached London,\r\nit was his custom to purchase immediately a large store of liquor and,\r\ntaking a place on whichever of the outgoing coaches he happened to light\r\non first, to drive through the country proclaiming the good news to all\r\nhe met on the road and dispensing it, along with the liquor, at every\r\nstopping-place to all who cared to listen or drink. Thus, after the\r\nNile, he had driven as far as Edinburgh; and later, when the coaches,\r\nwreathed with laurel for triumph, with cypress for mourning, were\r\nsetting out with the news of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s victory and death, he sat through\r\nall a chilly October night on the box of the Norwich \xe2\x80\x98Meteor\xe2\x80\x99 with a\r\nnautical keg of rum on his knees and two cases of old brandy under the\r\nseat. This genial custom was one of the many habits which he abandoned\r\non his marriage. The victories in the Peninsula, the retreat from\r\nMoscow, Leipzig, and the abdication of the tyrant all went uncelebrated.\r\nIt so happened, however, that in the summer of 1815 Sir Ferdinando was\r\nstaying for a few weeks in the capital. There had been a succession of\r\nanxious, doubtful days; then came the glorious news of Waterloo. It was\r\ntoo much for Sir Ferdinando; his joyous youth awoke again within him. He\r\nhurried to his wine merchant and bought a dozen bottles of 1760 brandy.\r\nThe Bath coach was on the point of starting; he bribed his way on to\r\nthe box and, seated in glory beside the driver, proclaimed aloud the\r\ndownfall of the Corsican bandit and passed about the warm liquid joy.\r\nThey clattered through Uxbridge, Slough, Maidenhead. Sleeping Reading\r\nwas awakened by the great news. At Didcot one of the ostlers was so\r\nmuch overcome by patriotic emotions and the 1760 brandy that he found it\r\nimpossible to do up the buckles of the harness. The night began to grow\r\nchilly, and Sir Ferdinando found that it was not enough to take a nip\r\nat every stage: to keep up his vital warmth he was compelled to drink\r\nbetween the stages as well. They were approaching Swindon. The coach\r\nwas travelling at a dizzy speed--six miles in the last half-hour--when,\r\nwithout having manifested the slightest premonitory symptom of\r\nunsteadiness, Sir Ferdinando suddenly toppled sideways off his seat\r\nand fell, head foremost, into the road. An unpleasant jolt awakened the\r\nslumbering passengers. The coach was brought to a standstill; the\r\nguard ran back with a light. He found Sir Ferdinando still alive, but\r\nunconscious; blood was oozing from his mouth. The back wheels of the\r\ncoach had passed over his body, breaking most of his ribs and both arms.\r\nHis skull was fractured in two places. They picked him up, but he was\r\ndead before they reached the next stage. So perished Sir Ferdinando,\r\na victim to his own patriotism. Lady Lapith did not marry again, but\r\ndetermined to devote the rest of her life to the well-being of her three\r\nchildren--Georgiana, now five years old, and Emmeline and Caroline,\r\ntwins of two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush paused, and once more put on his pince-nez. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much\r\nby way of introduction,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I can begin to read about my\r\ngrandfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I\xe2\x80\x99ve refilled my pipe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wimbush waited. Seated apart in a corner of the room, Ivor was\r\nshowing Mary his sketches of Spirit Life. They spoke together in\r\nwhispers.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan had lighted his pipe again. \xe2\x80\x9cFire away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush fired away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the spring of 1833 that my grandfather, George Wimbush, first\r\nmade the acquaintance of the \xe2\x80\x98three lovely Lapiths,\xe2\x80\x99 as they were always\r\ncalled. He was then a young man of twenty-two, with curly yellow hair\r\nand a smooth pink face that was the mirror of his youthful and ingenuous\r\nmind. He had been educated at Harrow and Christ Church, he enjoyed\r\nhunting and all other field sports, and, though his circumstances were\r\ncomfortable to the verge of affluence, his pleasures were temperate and\r\ninnocent. His father, an East Indian merchant, had destined him for a\r\npolitical career, and had gone to considerable expense in acquiring a\r\npleasant little Cornish borough as a twenty-first birthday gift for his\r\nson. He was justly indignant when, on the very eve of George\xe2\x80\x99s majority,\r\nthe Reform Bill of 1832 swept the borough out of existence. The\r\ninauguration of George\xe2\x80\x99s political career had to be postponed. At the\r\ntime he got to know the lovely Lapiths he was waiting; he was not at all\r\nimpatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lovely Lapiths did not fail to impress him. Georgiana, the eldest,\r\nwith her black ringlets, her flashing eyes, her noble aquiline profile,\r\nher swan-like neck, and sloping shoulders, was orientally dazzling; and\r\nthe twins, with their delicately turned-up noses, their blue eyes, and\r\nchestnut hair, were an identical pair of ravishingly English charmers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir conversation at this first meeting proved, however, to be so\r\nforbidding that, but for the invincible attraction exercised by their\r\nbeauty, George would never have had the courage to follow up the\r\nacquaintance. The twins, looking up their noses at him with an air of\r\nlanguid superiority, asked him what he thought of the latest French\r\npoetry and whether he liked the \xe2\x80\x98Indiana\xe2\x80\x99 of George Sand. But what\r\nwas almost worse was the question with which Georgiana opened her\r\nconversation with him. \xe2\x80\x98In music,\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, leaning forward and\r\nfixing him with her large dark eyes, \xe2\x80\x98are you a classicist or a\r\ntranscendentalist?\xe2\x80\x99 George did not lose his presence of mind. He had\r\nenough appreciation of music to know that he hated anything classical,\r\nand so, with a promptitude which did him credit, he replied, \xe2\x80\x98I am a\r\ntranscendentalist.\xe2\x80\x99 Georgiana smiled bewitchingly. \xe2\x80\x98I am glad,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x98so am I. You went to hear Paganini last week, of course. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nprayer of Moses\xe2\x80\x9d--ah!\xe2\x80\x99 She closed her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know anything more\r\ntranscendental than that?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said George, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99 He hesitated,\r\nwas about to go on speaking, and then decided that after all it would be\r\nwiser not to say--what was in fact true--that he had enjoyed above all\r\nPaganini\xe2\x80\x99s Farmyard Imitations. The man had made his fiddle bray like\r\nan ass, cluck like a hen, grunt, squeal, bark, neigh, quack, bellow, and\r\ngrowl; that last item, in George\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, had almost compensated\r\nfor the tediousness of the rest of the concert. He smiled with pleasure\r\nat the thought of it. Yes, decidedly, he was no classicist in music; he\r\nwas a thoroughgoing transcendentalist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge followed up this first introduction by paying a call on the\r\nyoung ladies and their mother, who occupied, during the season, a small\r\nbut elegant house in the neighbourhood of Berkeley Square. Lady Lapith\r\nmade a few discreet inquiries, and having found that George\xe2\x80\x99s financial\r\nposition, character, and family were all passably good, she asked him to\r\ndine. She hoped and expected that her daughters would all marry into\r\nthe peerage; but, being a prudent woman, she knew it was advisable to\r\nprepare for all contingencies. George Wimbush, she thought, would make\r\nan excellent second string for one of the twins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this first dinner, George\xe2\x80\x99s partner was Emmeline. They talked of\r\nNature. Emmeline protested that to her high mountains were a feeling and\r\nthe hum of human cities torture. George agreed that the country was very\r\nagreeable, but held that London during the season also had its charms.\r\nHe noticed with surprise and a certain solicitous distress that Miss\r\nEmmeline\xe2\x80\x99s appetite was poor, that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t, in fact, exist. Two\r\nspoonfuls of soup, a morsel of fish, no bird, no meat, and three\r\ngrapes--that was her whole dinner. He looked from time to time at her\r\ntwo sisters; Georgiana and Caroline seemed to be quite as abstemious.\r\nThey waved away whatever was offered them with an expression of delicate\r\ndisgust, shutting their eyes and averting their faces from the proffered\r\ndish, as though the lemon sole, the duck, the loin of veal, the trifle,\r\nwere objects revolting to the sight and smell. George, who thought the\r\ndinner capital, ventured to comment on the sisters\xe2\x80\x99 lack of appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pray, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me of eating,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emmeline, drooping like a\r\nsensitive plant. \xe2\x80\x98We find it so coarse, so unspiritual, my sisters and\r\nI. One can\xe2\x80\x99t think of one\xe2\x80\x99s soul while one is eating.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge agreed; one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98But one must live,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 Emmeline sighed. \xe2\x80\x98One must. Death is very beautiful, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x99 She broke a corner off a piece of toast and began to nibble\r\nat it languidly. \xe2\x80\x98But since, as you say, one must live...\xe2\x80\x99 She made a\r\nlittle gesture of resignation. \xe2\x80\x98Luckily a very little suffices to keep\r\none alive.\xe2\x80\x99 She put down her corner of toast half eaten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge regarded her with some surprise. She was pale, but she looked\r\nextraordinarily healthy, he thought; so did her sisters. Perhaps if\r\nyou were really spiritual you needed less food. He, clearly, was not\r\nspiritual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this he saw them frequently. They all liked him, from Lady Lapith\r\ndownwards. True, he was not very romantic or poetical; but he was such a\r\npleasant, unpretentious, kind-hearted young man, that one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp liking him. For his part, he thought them wonderful, wonderful,\r\nespecially Georgiana. He enveloped them all in a warm, protective\r\naffection. For they needed protection; they were altogether too frail,\r\ntoo spiritual for this world. They never ate, they were always pale,\r\nthey often complained of fever, they talked much and lovingly of death,\r\nthey frequently swooned. Georgiana was the most ethereal of all; of the\r\nthree she ate least, swooned most often, talked most of death, and was\r\nthe palest--with a pallor that was so startling as to appear positively\r\nartificial. At any moment, it seemed, she might loose her precarious\r\nhold on this material world and become all spirit. To George the thought\r\nwas a continual agony. If she were to die...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe contrived, however, to live through the season, and that in spite\r\nof the numerous balls, routs, and other parties of pleasure which, in\r\ncompany with the rest of the lovely trio, she never failed to attend. In\r\nthe middle of July the whole household moved down to the country. George\r\nwas invited to spend the month of August at Crome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house-party was distinguished; in the list of visitors figured\r\nthe names of two marriageable young men of title. George had hoped that\r\ncountry air, repose, and natural surroundings might have restored to\r\nthe three sisters their appetites and the roses of their cheeks. He was\r\nmistaken. For dinner, the first evening, Georgiana ate only an olive,\r\ntwo or three salted almonds, and half a peach. She was as pale as ever.\r\nDuring the meal she spoke of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98True love,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98being infinite and eternal, can only be\r\nconsummated in eternity. Indiana and Sir Rodolphe celebrated the mystic\r\nwedding of their souls by jumping into Niagara. Love is incompatible\r\nwith life. The wish of two people who truly love one another is not to\r\nlive together but to die together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Lapith, stout and practical. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nwould become of the next generation, pray, if all the world acted on\r\nyour principles?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mamma!...\xe2\x80\x99 Georgiana protested, and dropped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In my young days,\xe2\x80\x99 Lady Lapith went on, \xe2\x80\x98I should have been laughed\r\nout of countenance if I\xe2\x80\x99d said a thing like that. But then in my young\r\ndays souls weren\xe2\x80\x99t as fashionable as they are now and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\ndeath was at all poetical. It was just unpleasant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mamma!...\xe2\x80\x99 Emmeline and Caroline implored in unison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In my young days--\xe2\x80\x99 Lady Lapith was launched into her subject;\r\nnothing, it seemed, could stop her now. \xe2\x80\x98In my young days, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neat, people told you you needed a dose of rhubarb. Nowadays...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a cry; Georgiana had swooned sideways on to Lord Timpany\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder. It was a desperate expedient; but it was successful. Lady\r\nLapith was stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe days passed in an uneventful round of pleasures. Of all the gay\r\nparty George alone was unhappy. Lord Timpany was paying his court to\r\nGeorgiana, and it was clear that he was not unfavourably received.\r\nGeorge looked on, and his soul was a hell of jealousy and despair. The\r\nboisterous company of the young men became intolerable to him; he shrank\r\nfrom them, seeking gloom and solitude. One morning, having broken away\r\nfrom them on some vague pretext, he returned to the house alone. The\r\nyoung men were bathing in the pool below; their cries and laughter\r\nfloated up to him, making the quiet house seem lonelier and more silent.\r\nThe lovely sisters and their mamma still kept their chambers; they did\r\nnot customarily make their appearance till luncheon, so that the male\r\nguests had the morning to themselves. George sat down in the hall and\r\nabandoned himself to thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any moment she might die; at any moment she might become Lady\r\nTimpany. It was terrible, terrible. If she died, then he would die\r\ntoo; he would go to seek her beyond the grave. If she became Lady\r\nTimpany...ah, then! The solution of the problem would not be so simple.\r\nIf she became Lady Timpany: it was a horrible thought. But then suppose\r\nshe were in love with Timpany--though it seemed incredible that anyone\r\ncould be in love with Timpany--suppose her life depended on Timpany,\r\nsuppose she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live without him? He was fumbling his way along\r\nthis clueless labyrinth of suppositions when the clock struck twelve. On\r\nthe last stroke, like an automaton released by the turning clockwork, a\r\nlittle maid, holding a large covered tray, popped out of the door that\r\nled from the kitchen regions into the hall. From his deep arm-chair\r\nGeorge watched her (himself, it was evident, unobserved) with an idle\r\ncuriosity. She pattered across the room and came to a halt in front of\r\nwhat seemed a blank expense of panelling. She reached out her hand and,\r\nto George\xe2\x80\x99s extreme astonishment, a little door swung open, revealing\r\nthe foot of a winding staircase. Turning sideways in order to get her\r\ntray through the narrow opening, the little maid darted in with a rapid\r\ncrab-like motion. The door closed behind her with a click. A minute\r\nlater it opened again and the maid, without her tray, hurried back\r\nacross the hall and disappeared in the direction of the kitchen. George\r\ntried to recompose his thoughts, but an invincible curiosity drew his\r\nmind towards the hidden door, the staircase, the little maid. It was in\r\nvain he told himself that the matter was none of his business, that to\r\nexplore the secrets of that surprising door, that mysterious staircase\r\nwithin, would be a piece of unforgivable rudeness and indiscretion.\r\nIt was in vain; for five minutes he struggled heroically with his\r\ncuriosity, but at the end of that time he found himself standing in\r\nfront of the innocent sheet of panelling through which the little maid\r\nhad disappeared. A glance sufficed to show him the position of the\r\nsecret door--secret, he perceived, only to those who looked with\r\na careless eye. It was just an ordinary door let in flush with the\r\npanelling. No latch nor handle betrayed its position, but an unobtrusive\r\ncatch sunk in the wood invited the thumb. George was astonished that he\r\nhad not noticed it before; now he had seen it, it was so obvious,\r\nalmost as obvious as the cupboard door in the library with its lines\r\nof imitation shelves and its dummy books. He pulled back the catch and\r\npeeped inside. The staircase, of which the degrees were made not\r\nof stone but of blocks of ancient oak, wound up and out of sight.\r\nA slit-like window admitted the daylight; he was at the foot of the\r\ncentral tower, and the little window looked out over the terrace; they\r\nwere still shouting and splashing in the pool below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge closed the door and went back to his seat. But his curiosity\r\nwas not satisfied. Indeed, this partial satisfaction had but whetted\r\nits appetite. Where did the staircase lead? What was the errand of the\r\nlittle maid? It was no business of his, he kept repeating--no business\r\nof his. He tried to read, but his attention wandered. A quarter-past\r\ntwelve sounded on the harmonious clock. Suddenly determined, George\r\nrose, crossed the room, opened the hidden door, and began to ascend\r\nthe stairs. He passed the first window, corkscrewed round, and came\r\nto another. He paused for a moment to look out; his heart beat\r\nuncomfortably, as though he were affronting some unknown danger. What\r\nhe was doing, he told himself, was extremely ungentlemanly, horribly\r\nunderbred. He tiptoed onward and upward. One turn more, then half a\r\nturn, and a door confronted him. He halted before it, listened; he could\r\nhear no sound. Putting his eye to the keyhole, he saw nothing but a\r\nstretch of white sunlit wall. Emboldened, he turned the handle and\r\nstepped across the threshold. There he halted, petrified by what he saw,\r\nmutely gaping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the middle of a pleasantly sunny little room--\xe2\x80\x98it is now Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboudoir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Wimbush remarked parenthetically--stood a small circular\r\ntable of mahogany. Crystal, porcelain, and silver,--all the shining\r\napparatus of an elegant meal--were mirrored in its polished depths. The\r\ncarcase of a cold chicken, a bowl of fruit, a great ham, deeply gashed\r\nto its heart of tenderest white and pink, the brown cannon ball of\r\na cold plum-pudding, a slender Hock bottle, and a decanter of claret\r\njostled one another for a place on this festive board. And round the\r\ntable sat the three sisters, the three lovely Lapiths--eating!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt George\xe2\x80\x99s sudden entrance they had all looked towards the door, and\r\nnow they sat, petrified by the same astonishment which kept George fixed\r\nand staring. Georgiana, who sat immediately facing the door, gazed at\r\nhim with dark, enormous eyes. Between the thumb and forefinger of her\r\nright hand she was holding a drumstick of the dismembered chicken; her\r\nlittle finger, elegantly crooked, stood apart from the rest of her hand.\r\nHer mouth was open, but the drumstick had never reached its destination;\r\nit remained, suspended, frozen, in mid-air. The other two sisters had\r\nturned round to look at the intruder. Caroline still grasped her knife\r\nand fork; Emmeline\xe2\x80\x99s fingers were round the stem of her claret glass.\r\nFor what seemed a very long time, George and the three sisters stared\r\nat one another in silence. They were a group of statues. Then suddenly\r\nthere was movement. Georgiana dropped her chicken bone, Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s knife\r\nand fork clattered on her plate. The movement propagated itself, grew\r\nmore decisive; Emmeline sprang to her feet, uttering a cry. The wave of\r\npanic reached George; he turned and, mumbling something unintelligible\r\nas he went, rushed out of the room and down the winding stairs. He came\r\nto a standstill in the hall, and there, all by himself in the quiet\r\nhouse, he began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt luncheon it was noticed that the sisters ate a little more than\r\nusual. Georgiana toyed with some French beans and a spoonful of\r\ncalves\xe2\x80\x99-foot jelly. \xe2\x80\x98I feel a little stronger to-day,\xe2\x80\x99 she said to Lord\r\nTimpany, when he congratulated her on this increase of appetite; \xe2\x80\x98a\r\nlittle more material,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, with a nervous laugh. Looking up, she\r\ncaught George\xe2\x80\x99s eye; a blush suffused her cheeks and she looked hastily\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden that afternoon they found themselves for a moment alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone, George? Promise you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nimplored. \xe2\x80\x98It would make us look so ridiculous. And besides, eating IS\r\nunspiritual, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Say you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said George brutally. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell everyone, unless...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s blackmail.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, said George. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you twenty-four hours to\r\ndecide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Lapith was disappointed, of course; she had hoped for better\r\nthings--for Timpany and a coronet. But George, after all, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad.\r\nThey were married at the New Year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor grandfather!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wimbush added, as he closed his book and\r\nput away his pince-nez. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I read in the papers about oppressed\r\nnationalities, I think of him.\xe2\x80\x9d He relighted his cigar. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\na maternal government, highly centralised, and there were no\r\nrepresentative institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush ceased speaking. In the silence that ensued Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhispered commentary on the spirit sketches once more became audible.\r\nPriscilla, who had been dozing, suddenly woke up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in the startled tones of one newly returned to\r\nconsciousness; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJenny caught the words. She looked up, smiled, nodded reassuringly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about a ham,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s about a ham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Henry has been reading.\xe2\x80\x9d She closed the red notebook lying on\r\nher knees and slipped a rubber band round it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nannounced, and got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, yawning. But she lacked the energy to rise from\r\nher arm-chair.\r\n\r\nThe night was hot and oppressive. Round the open windows the curtains\r\nhung unmoving. Ivor, fanning himself with the portrait of an Astral\r\nBeing, looked out into the darkness and drew a breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe air\xe2\x80\x99s like wool,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will get cooler after midnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush, and cautiously\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPriscilla turned her head in his direction; the monumental coiffure\r\nnodded exorbitantly at her slightest movement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must make an\r\neffort,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, I concentrate my will: I say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will sleep, I am asleep!\xe2\x80\x99 And pop! off I go. That\xe2\x80\x99s the power of\r\nthought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does it work on stuffy nights?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivor inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cI simply cannot\r\nsleep on a stuffy night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor can I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept out of doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of doors! What a wonderful idea!\xe2\x80\x9d In the end they decided to sleep\r\non the towers--Mary on the western tower, Ivor on the eastern. There\r\nwas a flat expanse of leads on each of the towers, and you could get a\r\nmattress through the trap doors that opened on to them. Under the stars,\r\nunder the gibbous moon, assuredly they would sleep. The mattresses were\r\nhauled up, sheets and blankets were spread, and an hour later the two\r\ninsomniasts, each on his separate tower, were crying their good-nights\r\nacross the dividing gulf.\r\n\r\nOn Mary the sleep-compelling charm of the open air did not work with its\r\nexpected magic. Even through the mattress one could not fail to be aware\r\nthat the leads were extremely hard. Then there were noises: the owls\r\nscreeched tirelessly, and once, roused by some unknown terror, all the\r\ngeese of the farmyard burst into a sudden frenzy of cackling. The stars\r\nand the gibbous moon demanded to be looked at, and when one meteorite\r\nhad streaked across the sky, you could not help waiting, open-eyed and\r\nalert, for the next. Time passed; the moon climbed higher and higher in\r\nthe sky. Mary felt less sleepy than she had when she first came out.\r\nShe sat up and looked over the parapet. Had Ivor been able to sleep? she\r\nwondered. And as though in answer to her mental question, from\r\nbehind the chimney-stack at the farther end of the roof a white form\r\nnoiselessly emerged--a form that, in the moonlight, was recognisably\r\nIvor\xe2\x80\x99s. Spreading his arms to right and left, like a tight-rope dancer,\r\nhe began to walk forward along the roof-tree of the house. He swayed\r\nterrifyingly as he advanced. Mary looked on speechlessly; perhaps he was\r\nwalking in his sleep! Suppose he were to wake up suddenly, now! If she\r\nspoke or moved it might mean his death. She dared look no more, but sank\r\nback on her pillows. She listened intently. For what seemed an immensely\r\nlong time there was no sound. Then there was a patter of feet on the\r\ntiles, followed by a scrabbling noise and a whispered \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nsuddenly Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s head and shoulders appeared above the parapet. One leg\r\nfollowed, then the other. He was on the leads. Mary pretended to wake up\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cso I came along to see if you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. One gets bored by oneself on a tower. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you find it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was light before five. Long, narrow clouds barred the east, their\r\nedges bright with orange fire. The sky was pale and watery. With the\r\nmournful scream of a soul in pain, a monstrous peacock, flying heavily\r\nup from below, alighted on the parapet of the tower. Ivor and Mary\r\nstarted broad awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ivor, jumping up. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a feather.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfrightened peacock ran up and down the parapet in an absurd distress,\r\ncurtseying and bobbing and clucking; his long tail swung ponderously\r\nback and forth as he turned and turned again. Then with a flap and swish\r\nhe launched himself upon the air and sailed magnificently earthward,\r\nwith a recovered dignity. But he had left a trophy. Ivor had his\r\nfeather, a long-lashed eye of purple and green, of blue and gold. He\r\nhanded it to his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn angel\xe2\x80\x99s feather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMary looked at it for a moment, gravely and intently. Her purple pyjamas\r\nclothed her with an ampleness that hid the lines of her body; she looked\r\nlike some large, comfortable, unjointed toy, a sort of Teddy-bear--but\r\na Teddy bear with an angel\xe2\x80\x99s head, pink cheeks, and hair like a bell\r\nof gold. An angel\xe2\x80\x99s face, the feather of an angel\xe2\x80\x99s wing...Somehow the\r\nwhole atmosphere of this sunrise was rather angelic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary to think of sexual selection,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last,\r\nlooking up from her contemplation of the miraculous feather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d Ivor echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cI select you, you select me. What luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her shoulders and they stood looking eastward. The\r\nfirst sunlight had begun to warm and colour the pale light of the dawn.\r\nMauve pyjamas and white pyjamas; they were a young and charming couple.\r\nThe rising sun touched their faces. It was all extremely symbolic;\r\nbut then, if you choose to think so, nothing in this world is not\r\nsymbolical. Profound and beautiful truth!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be getting back to my tower,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivor at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid so. The varletry will soon be up and about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvor...\xe2\x80\x9d There was a prolonged and silent farewell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivor, \xe2\x80\x9cI repeat my tight-rope stunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary threw her arms round his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t, Ivor. It\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.\r\nPlease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had to yield at last to her entreaties. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo down through the house and up at the other end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe vanished through the trap door into the darkness that still lurked\r\nwithin the shuttered house. A minute later he had reappeared on the\r\nfarther tower; he waved his hand, and then sank down, out of sight,\r\nbehind the parapet. From below, in the house, came the thin wasp-like\r\nbuzzing of an alarum-clock. He had gone back just in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nIvor was gone. Lounging behind the wind-screen in his yellow sedan he\r\nwas whirling across rural England. Social and amorous engagements of the\r\nmost urgent character called him from hall to baronial hall, from castle\r\nto castle, from Elizabethan manor-house to Georgian mansion, over\r\nthe whole expanse of the kingdom. To-day in Somerset, to-morrow in\r\nWarwickshire, on Saturday in the West riding, by Tuesday morning in\r\nArgyll--Ivor never rested. The whole summer through, from the\r\nbeginning of July till the end of September, he devoted himself to his\r\nengagements; he was a martyr to them. In the autumn he went back to\r\nLondon for a holiday. Crome had been a little incident, an evanescent\r\nbubble on the stream of his life; it belonged already to the past. By\r\ntea-time he would be at Gobley, and there would be Zenobia\xe2\x80\x99s welcoming\r\nsmile. And on Thursday morning--but that was a long, long way ahead. He\r\nwould think of Thursday morning when Thursday morning arrived. Meanwhile\r\nthere was Gobley, meanwhile Zenobia.\r\n\r\nIn the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s book at Crome Ivor had left, according to his\r\ninvariable custom in these cases, a poem. He had improvised it\r\nmagisterially in the ten minutes preceding his departure. Denis and Mr.\r\nScogan strolled back together from the gates of the courtyard, whence\r\nthey had bidden their last farewells; on the writing-table in the hall\r\nthey found the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s book, open, and Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s composition scarcely\r\ndry. Mr. Scogan read it aloud:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cThe magic of those immemorial kings,\r\n\r\n               Who webbed enchantment on the bowls of night.\r\n\r\n               Sleeps in the soul of all created things;\r\n\r\n               In the blue sea, th\xe2\x80\x99 Acroceraunian height,\r\n\r\n               In the eyed butterfly\xe2\x80\x99s auricular wings\r\n\r\n               And orgied visions of the anchorite;\r\n\r\n               In all that singing flies and flying sings,\r\n\r\n               In rain, in pain, in delicate delight.\r\n\r\n               But much more magic, much more cogent spells\r\n\r\n               Weave here their wizardries about my soul.\r\n\r\n               Crome calls me like the voice of vesperal bells,\r\n\r\n               Haunts like a ghostly-peopled necropole.\r\n\r\n                   Fate tears me hence. Hard fate! since far from Crome\r\n\r\n                   My soul must weep, remembering its Home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery nice and tasteful and tactful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, when he had\r\nfinished. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only troubled by the butterfly\xe2\x80\x99s auricular wings. You\r\nhave a first-hand knowledge of the workings of a poet\xe2\x80\x99s mind, Denis;\r\nperhaps you can explain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could be simpler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful word, and Ivor\r\nwanted to say that the wings were golden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make it luminously clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne suffers so much,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis went on, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the fact that beautiful\r\nwords don\xe2\x80\x99t always mean what they ought to mean. Recently, for example,\r\nI had a whole poem ruined, just because the word \xe2\x80\x98carminative\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean what it ought to have meant. Carminative--it\xe2\x80\x99s admirable, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a word I\xe2\x80\x99ve treasured from my earliest infancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctreasured and loved. They used to give me cinnamon when I had a\r\ncold--quite useless, but not disagreeable. One poured it drop by drop\r\nout of narrow bottles, a golden liquor, fierce and fiery. On the label\r\nwas a list of its virtues, and among other things it was described as\r\nbeing in the highest degree carminative. I adored the word. \xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\ncarminative?\xe2\x80\x99 I used to say to myself when I\xe2\x80\x99d taken my dose. It seemed\r\nso wonderfully to describe that sensation of internal warmth, that glow,\r\nthat--what shall I call it?--physical self-satisfaction which\r\nfollowed the drinking of cinnamon. Later, when I discovered alcohol,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98carminative\xe2\x80\x99 described for me that similar, but nobler, more spiritual\r\nglow which wine evokes not only in the body but in the soul as well.\r\nThe carminative virtues of burgundy, of rum, of old brandy, of Lacryma\r\nChristi, of Marsala, of Aleatico, of stout, of gin, of champagne, of\r\nclaret, of the raw new wine of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Tuscan vintage--I compared\r\nthem, I classified them. Marsala is rosily, downily carminative; gin\r\npricks and refreshes while it warms. I had a whole table of carmination\r\nvalues. And now\xe2\x80\x9d--Denis spread out his hands, palms upwards,\r\ndespairingly--\xe2\x80\x9cnow I know what carminative really means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what DOES it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Scogan, a little impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarminative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, lingering lovingly over the syllables,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccarminative. I imagined vaguely that it had something to do with\r\ncarmen-carminis, still more vaguely with caro-carnis, and its\r\nderivations, like carnival and carnation. Carminative--there was the\r\nidea of singing and the idea of flesh, rose-coloured and warm, with\r\na suggestion of the jollities of mi-Careme and the masked holidays of\r\nVenice. Carminative--the warmth, the glow, the interior ripeness were\r\nall in the word. Instead of which...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo come to the point, my dear Denis,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cDo come to\r\nthe point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wrote a poem the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis; \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote a poem about\r\nthe effects of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOthers have done the same before you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no\r\nneed to be ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was putting forward the notion,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the effects\r\nof love were often similar to the effects of wine, that Eros could\r\nintoxicate as well as Bacchus. Love, for example, is essentially\r\ncarminative. It gives one the sense of warmth, the glow.\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x99_And passion carminative as wine_...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nwas what I wrote. Not only was the line elegantly sonorous; it was also,\r\nI flattered myself, very aptly compendiously expressive. Everything\r\nwas in the word carminative--a detailed, exact foreground, an immense,\r\nindefinite hinterland of suggestion.\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x99_And passion carminative as wine_...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was not ill-pleased. And then suddenly it occurred to me that I had\r\nnever actually looked up the word in a dictionary. Carminative had grown\r\nup with me from the days of the cinnamon bottle. It had always been\r\ntaken for granted. Carminative: for me the word was as rich in content\r\nas some tremendous, elaborate work of art; it was a complete landscape\r\nwith figures.\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x99_And passion carminative as wine_...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had ever committed the word to writing, and all\r\nat once I felt I would like lexicographical authority for it. A small\r\nEnglish-German dictionary was all I had at hand. I turned up C, ca,\r\ncar, carm. There it was: \xe2\x80\x98Carminative: windtreibend.\xe2\x80\x99 Windtreibend!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated. Mr. Scogan laughed. Denis shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nme it was no laughing matter. For me it marked the end of a chapter, the\r\ndeath of something young and precious. There were the years--years\r\nof childhood and innocence--when I had believed that carminative\r\nmeant--well, carminative. And now, before me lies the rest of my\r\nlife--a day, perhaps, ten years, half a century, when I shall know that\r\ncarminative means windtreibend.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x98Plus ne suis ce que j\xe2\x80\x99ai ete\r\n\r\n                   Et ne le saurai jamais etre.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt is a realisation that makes one rather melancholy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarminative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarminative,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis repeated, and they were silent for a time. \xe2\x80\x9cWords,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Denis at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwords--I wonder if you can realise how much I love\r\nthem. You are too much preoccupied with mere things and ideas and people\r\nto understand the full beauty of words. Your mind is not a literary\r\nmind. The spectacle of Mr. Gladstone finding thirty-four rhymes to\r\nthe name \xe2\x80\x98Margot\xe2\x80\x99 seems to you rather pathetic than anything else.\r\nMallarm\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s envelopes with their versified addresses leave you cold,\r\nunless they leave you pitiful; you can\xe2\x80\x99t see that\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x98Apte \xc3\xa0 ne point te cabrer, hue!\r\n\r\n                   Poste et j\xe2\x80\x99ajouterai, dia!\r\n\r\n                   Si tu ne fuis onze-bis Rue\r\n\r\n                   Balzac, chez cet H\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9dia,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nis a little miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it to be magical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the test for the literary mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis; \xe2\x80\x9cthe feeling of\r\nmagic, the sense that words have power. The technical, verbal part of\r\nliterature is simply a development of magic. Words are man\xe2\x80\x99s first and\r\nmost grandiose invention. With language he created a whole new universe;\r\nwhat wonder if he loved words and attributed power to them! With fitted,\r\nharmonious words the magicians summoned rabbits out of empty hats and\r\nspirits from the elements. Their descendants, the literary men, still\r\ngo on with the process, morticing their verbal formulas together, and,\r\nbefore the power of the finished spell, trembling with delight and awe.\r\nRabbits out of empty hats? No, their spells are more subtly powerful,\r\nfor they evoke emotions out of empty minds. Formulated by their art the\r\nmost insipid statements become enormously significant. For example, I\r\nproffer the constatation, \xe2\x80\x98Black ladders lack bladders.\xe2\x80\x99 A self-evident\r\ntruth, one on which it would not have been worth while to insist, had\r\nI chosen to formulate it in such words as \xe2\x80\x98Black fire-escapes have no\r\nbladders,\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98Les echelles noires manquent de vessie.\xe2\x80\x99 But since I\r\nput it as I do, \xe2\x80\x98Black ladders lack bladders,\xe2\x80\x99 it becomes, for all\r\nits self-evidence, significant, unforgettable, moving. The creation by\r\nword-power of something out of nothing--what is that but magic? And, I\r\nmay add, what is that but literature? Half the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest poetry\r\nis simply \xe2\x80\x98Les echelles noires manquent de vessie,\xe2\x80\x99 translated into\r\nmagic significance as, \xe2\x80\x98Black ladders lack bladders.\xe2\x80\x99 And you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nappreciate words. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mental carminative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\r\nneed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nPerched on its four stone mushrooms, the little granary stood two or\r\nthree feet above the grass of the green close. Beneath it there was a\r\nperpetual shade and a damp growth of long, luxuriant grasses. Here, in\r\nthe shadow, in the green dampness, a family of white ducks had sought\r\nshelter from the afternoon sun. Some stood, preening themselves, some\r\nreposed with their long bellies pressed to the ground, as though the\r\ncool grass were water. Little social noises burst fitfully forth, and\r\nfrom time to time some pointed tail would execute a brilliant Lisztian\r\ntremolo. Suddenly their jovial repose was shattered. A prodigious thump\r\nshook the wooden flooring above their heads; the whole granary trembled,\r\nlittle fragments of dirt and crumbled wood rained down among them.\r\nWith a loud, continuous quacking the ducks rushed out from beneath this\r\nnameless menace, and did not stay their flight till they were safely in\r\nthe farmyard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lose your temper,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cListen! You\xe2\x80\x99ve frightened\r\nthe ducks. Poor dears! no wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d She was sitting sideways in a low,\r\nwooden chair. Her right elbow rested on the back of the chair and she\r\nsupported her cheek on her hand. Her long, slender body drooped into\r\ncurves of a lazy grace. She was smiling, and she looked at Gombauld\r\nthrough half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you!\xe2\x80\x9d Gombauld repeated, and stamped his foot again. He glared at\r\nher round the half-finished portrait on the easel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor ducks!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne repeated. The sound of their quacking was faint in\r\nthe distance; it was inaudible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see you make me lose my time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t work with\r\nyou dangling about distractingly like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d lose less time if you stopped talking and stamping your feet and\r\ndid a little painting for a change. After all, what am I dangling about\r\nfor, except to be painted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGombauld made a noise like a growl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re awful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\nconviction. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask me to come and stay here? Why do you tell me\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like me to paint your portrait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the simple reasons that I like you--at least, when you\xe2\x80\x99re in a good\r\ntemper--and that I think you\xe2\x80\x99re a good painter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the simple reason\xe2\x80\x9d--Gombauld mimicked her voice--\xe2\x80\x9cthat you want\r\nme to make love to you and, when I do, to have the amusement of running\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne threw back her head and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you think it amuses me to have\r\nto evade your advances! So like a man! If you only knew how gross and\r\nawful and boring men are when they try to make love and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nthem to make love! If you could only see yourselves through our eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGombauld picked up his palette and brushes and attacked his canvas with\r\nthe ardour of irritation. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll be saying next that you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t start the game, that it was I who made the first advances, and\r\nthat you were the innocent victim who sat still and never did anything\r\nthat could invite or allure me on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo like a man again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always the same old story about\r\nthe woman tempting the man. The woman lures, fascinates, invites; and\r\nman--noble man, innocent man--falls a victim. My poor Gombauld! Surely\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sing that old song again. It\xe2\x80\x99s so unintelligent, and\r\nI always thought you were a man of sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gombauld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe a little objective,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne went on. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see that you\xe2\x80\x99re simply\r\nexternalising your own emotions? That\xe2\x80\x99s what you men are always doing;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s so barbarously naive. You feel one of your loose desires for some\r\nwoman, and because you desire her strongly you immediately accuse her\r\nof luring you on, of deliberately provoking and inviting the desire. You\r\nhave the mentality of savages. You might just as well say that a plate\r\nof strawberries and cream deliberately lures you on to feel greedy. In\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred women are as passive and innocent as\r\nthe strawberries and cream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all I can say is that this must be the hundredth case,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGombauld, without looking up.\r\n\r\nAnne shrugged her shoulders and gave vent to a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m at a loss to\r\nknow whether you\xe2\x80\x99re more silly or more rude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter painting for a little time in silence Gombauld began to speak\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then there\xe2\x80\x99s Denis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, renewing the conversation as\r\nthough it had only just been broken off. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re playing the same game\r\nwith him. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you leave that wretched young man in peace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne flushed with a sudden and uncontrollable anger. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly\r\nuntrue about Denis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI never dreamt of playing\r\nwhat you beautifully call the same game with him.\xe2\x80\x9d Recovering her calm,\r\nshe added in her ordinary cooing voice and with her exacerbating smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve become very protective towards poor Denis all of a sudden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d Gombauld replied, with a gravity that was somehow a little too\r\nsolemn. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see a young man...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c...being whirled along the road to ruin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, continuing his\r\nsentence for him. \xe2\x80\x9cI admire your sentiments and, believe me, I share\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was curiously irritated at what Gombauld had said about Denis. It\r\nhappened to be so completely untrue. Gombauld might have some slight\r\nground for his reproaches. But Denis--no, she had never flirted with\r\nDenis. Poor boy! He was very sweet. She became somewhat pensive.\r\n\r\nGombauld painted on with fury. The restlessness of an unsatisfied\r\ndesire, which, before, had distracted his mind, making work impossible,\r\nseemed now to have converted itself into a kind of feverish energy. When\r\nit was finished, he told himself, the portrait would be diabolic. He was\r\npainting her in the pose she had naturally adopted at the first sitting.\r\nSeated sideways, her elbow on the back of the chair, her head and\r\nshoulders turned at an angle from the rest of her body, towards the\r\nfront, she had fallen into an attitude of indolent abandonment. He had\r\nemphasised the lazy curves of her body; the lines sagged as they crossed\r\nthe canvas, the grace of the painted figure seemed to be melting into\r\na kind of soft decay. The hand that lay along the knee was as limp as\r\na glove. He was at work on the face now; it had begun to emerge on the\r\ncanvas, doll-like in its regularity and listlessness. It was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface--but her face as it would be, utterly unillumined by the inward\r\nlights of thought and emotion. It was the lazy, expressionless mask\r\nwhich was sometimes her face. The portrait was terribly like; and at the\r\nsame time it was the most malicious of lies. Yes, it would be diabolic\r\nwhen it was finished, Gombauld decided; he wondered what she would think\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of peace and quiet Denis had retired earlier on this same\r\nafternoon to his bedroom. He wanted to work, but the hour was a drowsy\r\none, and lunch, so recently eaten, weighed heavily on body and mind. The\r\nmeridian demon was upon him; he was possessed by that bored and hopeless\r\npost-prandial melancholy which the coenobites of old knew and feared\r\nunder the name of \xe2\x80\x9caccidie.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt, like Ernest Dowson, \xe2\x80\x9ca little\r\nweary.\xe2\x80\x9d He was in the mood to write something rather exquisite and\r\ngentle and quietist in tone; something a little droopy and at the same\r\ntime--how should he put it?--a little infinite. He thought of Anne, of\r\nlove hopeless and unattainable. Perhaps that was the ideal kind of love,\r\nthe hopeless kind--the quiet, theoretical kind of love. In this sad mood\r\nof repletion he could well believe it. He began to write. One elegant\r\nquatrain had flowed from beneath his pen:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cA brooding love which is at most\r\n\r\n                   The stealth of moonbeams when they slide,\r\n\r\n               Evoking colour\xe2\x80\x99s bloodless ghost,\r\n\r\n                   O\xe2\x80\x99er some scarce-breathing breast or side...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nwhen his attention was attracted by a sound from outside. He looked down\r\nfrom his window; there they were, Anne and Gombauld, talking, laughing\r\ntogether. They crossed the courtyard in front, and passed out of sight\r\nthrough the gate in the right-hand wall. That was the way to the\r\ngreen close and the granary; she was going to sit for him again. His\r\npleasantly depressing melancholy was dissipated by a puff of violent\r\nemotion; angrily he threw his quatrain into the waste-paper basket and\r\nran downstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe stealth of moonbeams,\xe2\x80\x9d indeed!\r\n\r\nIn the hall he saw Mr. Scogan; the man seemed to be lying in wait. Denis\r\ntried to escape, but in vain. Mr. Scogan\xe2\x80\x99s eye glittered like the eye of\r\nthe Ancient Mariner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stretching out a small saurian hand with pointed\r\nnails--\xe2\x80\x9cnot so fast. I was just going down to the flower garden to take\r\nthe sun. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis abandoned himself; Mr. Scogan put on his hat and they went out arm\r\nin arm. On the shaven turf of the terrace Henry Wimbush and Mary were\r\nplaying a solemn game of bowls. They descended by the yew-tree walk.\r\nIt was here, thought Denis, here that Anne had fallen, here that he\r\nhad kissed her, here--and he blushed with retrospective shame at the\r\nmemory--here that he had tried to carry her and failed. Life was awful!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanity!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, suddenly breaking a long silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanity--that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me and that\xe2\x80\x99s what will be wrong with\r\nyou, my dear Denis, when you\xe2\x80\x99re old enough to be sane or insane. In\r\na sane world I should be a great man; as things are, in this curious\r\nestablishment, I am nothing at all; to all intents and purposes I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexist. I am just Vox et praeterea nihil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis made no response; he was thinking of other things. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said to himself--\xe2\x80\x9cafter all, Gombauld is better looking than I, more\r\nentertaining, more confident; and, besides, he\xe2\x80\x99s already somebody and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m still only potential...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything that ever gets done in this world is done by madmen,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nScogan went on. Denis tried not to listen, but the tireless insistence\r\nof Mr. Scogan\xe2\x80\x99s discourse gradually compelled his attention. \xe2\x80\x9cMen such\r\nas I am, such as you may possibly become, have never achieved anything.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re too sane; we\xe2\x80\x99re merely reasonable. We lack the human touch, the\r\ncompelling enthusiastic mania. People are quite ready to listen to the\r\nphilosophers for a little amusement, just as they would listen to a\r\nfiddler or a mountebank. But as to acting on the advice of the men of\r\nreason--never. Wherever the choice has had to be made between the man of\r\nreason and the madman, the world has unhesitatingly followed the madman.\r\nFor the madman appeals to what is fundamental, to passion and\r\nthe instincts; the philosophers to what is superficial and\r\nsupererogatory--reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered the garden; at the head of one of the alleys stood a green\r\nwooden bench, embayed in the midst of a fragrant continent of lavender\r\nbushes. It was here, though the place was shadeless and one breathed\r\nhot, dry perfume instead of air--it was here that Mr. Scogan elected to\r\nsit. He thrived on untempered sunlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider, for example, the case of Luther and Erasmus.\xe2\x80\x9d He took out\r\nhis pipe and began to fill it as he talked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was Erasmus, a man\r\nof reason if ever there was one. People listened to him at first--a\r\nnew virtuoso performing on that elegant and resourceful instrument, the\r\nintellect; they even admired and venerated him. But did he move them to\r\nbehave as he wanted them to behave--reasonably, decently, or at least a\r\nlittle less porkishly than usual? He did not. And then Luther appears,\r\nviolent, passionate, a madman insanely convinced about matters in which\r\nthere can be no conviction. He shouted, and men rushed to follow\r\nhim. Erasmus was no longer listened to; he was reviled for his\r\nreasonableness. Luther was serious, Luther was reality--like the Great\r\nWar. Erasmus was only reason and decency; he lacked the power, being a\r\nsage, to move men to action. Europe followed Luther and embarked on\r\na century and a half of war and bloody persecution. It\xe2\x80\x99s a melancholy\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan lighted a match. In the intense light the flame was\r\nall but invisible. The smell of burning tobacco began to mingle with the\r\nsweetly acrid smell of the lavender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to get men to act reasonably, you must set about persuading\r\nthem in a maniacal manner. The very sane precepts of the founders of\r\nreligions are only made infectious by means of enthusiasms which to a\r\nsane man must appear deplorable. It is humiliating to find how impotent\r\nunadulterated sanity is. Sanity, for example, informs us that the only\r\nway in which we can preserve civilisation is by behaving decently and\r\nintelligently. Sanity appeals and argues; our rulers persevere in their\r\ncustomary porkishness, while we acquiesce and obey. The only hope is a\r\nmaniacal crusade; I am ready, when it comes, to beat a tambourine with\r\nthe loudest, but at the same time I shall feel a little ashamed of\r\nmyself. However\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Scogan shrugged his shoulders and, pipe in hand,\r\nmade a gesture of resignation--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s futile to complain that things are\r\nas they are. The fact remains that sanity unassisted is useless. What\r\nwe want, then, is a sane and reasonable exploitation of the forces of\r\ninsanity. We sane men will have the power yet.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shone\r\nwith a more than ordinary brightness, and, taking his pipe out of his\r\nmouth, he gave vent to his loud, dry, and somehow rather fiendish laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want power,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. He was sitting in limp discomfort\r\nat one end of the bench, shading his eyes from the intolerable light.\r\nMr. Scogan, bolt upright at the other end, laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody wants power,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPower in some form or other. The sort\r\nof power you hanker for is literary power. Some people want power\r\nto persecute other human beings; you expend your lust for power in\r\npersecuting words, twisting them, moulding them, torturing them to obey\r\nyou. But I divagate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Denis faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan continued, unheeding, \xe2\x80\x9cthe time will come. We men\r\nof intelligence will learn to harness the insanities to the service of\r\nreason. We can\xe2\x80\x99t leave the world any longer to the direction of chance.\r\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t allow dangerous maniacs like Luther, mad about dogma, like\r\nNapoleon, mad about himself, to go on casually appearing and turning\r\neverything upside down. In the past it didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much matter; but our\r\nmodern machine is too delicate. A few more knocks like the Great War,\r\nanother Luther or two, and the whole concern will go to pieces. In\r\nfuture, the men of reason must see that the madness of the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaniacs is canalised into proper channels, is made to do useful work,\r\nlike a mountain torrent driving a dynamo...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking electricity to light a Swiss hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to\r\ncomplete the simile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan waved away the interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing to be\r\ndone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe men of intelligence must combine, must conspire,\r\nand seize power from the imbeciles and maniacs who now direct us. They\r\nmust found the Rational State.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heat that was slowly paralysing all Denis\xe2\x80\x99s mental and bodily\r\nfaculties, seemed to bring to Mr. Scogan additional vitality. He talked\r\nwith an ever-increasing energy, his hands moved in sharp, quick, precise\r\ngestures, his eyes shone. Hard, dry, and continuous, his voice went\r\non sounding and sounding in Denis\xe2\x80\x99s ears with the insistence of a\r\nmechanical noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Rational State,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard Mr. Scogan saying, \xe2\x80\x9chuman beings will\r\nbe separated out into distinct species, not according to the colour of\r\ntheir eyes or the shape of their skulls, but according to the qualities\r\nof their mind and temperament. Examining psychologists, trained to what\r\nwould now seem an almost superhuman clairvoyance, will test each child\r\nthat is born and assign it to its proper species. Duly labelled and\r\ndocketed, the child will be given the education suitable to members of\r\nits species, and will be set, in adult life, to perform those functions\r\nwhich human beings of his variety are capable of performing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many species will there be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great many, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthe classification will\r\nbe subtle and elaborate. But it is not in the power of a prophet to go\r\ninto details, nor is it his business. I will do more than indicate the\r\nthree main species into which the subjects of the Rational State will be\r\ndivided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, cleared his throat, and coughed once or twice, evoking in\r\nDenis\xe2\x80\x99s mind the vision of a table with a glass and water-bottle, and,\r\nlying across one corner, a long white pointer for the lantern pictures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe three main species,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be these: the\r\nDirecting Intelligences, the Men of Faith, and the Herd. Among the\r\nIntelligences will be found all those capable of thought, those who know\r\nhow to attain a certain degree of freedom--and, alas, how limited, even\r\namong the most intelligent, that freedom is!--from the mental bondage of\r\ntheir time. A select body of Intelligences, drawn from among those who\r\nhave turned their attention to the problems of practical life, will\r\nbe the governors of the Rational State. They will employ as their\r\ninstruments of power the second great species of humanity--the men of\r\nFaith, the Madmen, as I have been calling them, who believe in things\r\nunreasonably, with passion, and are ready to die for their beliefs and\r\ntheir desires. These wild men, with their fearful potentialities for\r\ngood or for mischief, will no longer be allowed to react casually to\r\na casual environment. There will be no more Caesar Borgias, no more\r\nLuthers and Mohammeds, no more Joanna Southcotts, no more Comstocks. The\r\nold-fashioned Man of Faith and Desire, that haphazard creature of brute\r\ncircumstance, who might drive men to tears and repentance, or who might\r\nequally well set them on to cutting one another\xe2\x80\x99s throats, will be\r\nreplaced by a new sort of madman, still externally the same, still\r\nbubbling with a seemingly spontaneous enthusiasm, but, ah, how very\r\ndifferent from the madman of the past! For the new Man of Faith will be\r\nexpending his passion, his desire, and his enthusiasm in the propagation\r\nof some reasonable idea. He will be, all unawares, the tool of some\r\nsuperior intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan chuckled maliciously; it was as though he were taking a\r\nrevenge, in the name of reason, on enthusiasts. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom their earliest\r\nyears, as soon, that is, as the examining psychologists have assigned\r\nthem their place in the classified scheme, the Men of Faith will have\r\nhad their special education under the eye of the Intelligences. Moulded\r\nby a long process of suggestion, they will go out into the world,\r\npreaching and practising with a generous mania the coldly reasonable\r\nprojects of the Directors from above. When these projects are\r\naccomplished, or when the ideas that were useful a decade ago have\r\nceased to be useful, the Intelligences will inspire a new generation of\r\nmadmen with a new eternal truth. The principal function of the Men of\r\nFaith will be to move and direct the Multitude, that third great species\r\nconsisting of those countless millions who lack intelligence and are\r\nwithout valuable enthusiasm. When any particular effort is required of\r\nthe Herd, when it is thought necessary, for the sake of solidarity, that\r\nhumanity shall be kindled and united by some single enthusiastic desire\r\nor idea, the Men of Faith, primed with some simple and satisfying creed,\r\nwill be sent out on a mission of evangelisation. At ordinary times, when\r\nthe high spiritual temperature of a Crusade would be unhealthy, the\r\nMen of Faith will be quietly and earnestly busy with the great work of\r\neducation. In the upbringing of the Herd, humanity\xe2\x80\x99s almost boundless\r\nsuggestibility will be scientifically exploited. Systematically, from\r\nearliest infancy, its members will be assured that there is no happiness\r\nto be found except in work and obedience; they will be made to believe\r\nthat they are happy, that they are tremendously important beings, and\r\nthat everything they do is noble and significant. For the lower species\r\nthe earth will be restored to the centre of the universe and man to\r\npre-eminence on the earth. Oh, I envy the lot of the commonality in the\r\nRational State! Working their eight hours a day, obeying their betters,\r\nconvinced of their own grandeur and significance and immortality, they\r\nwill be marvellously happy, happier than any race of men has ever been.\r\nThey will go through life in a rosy state of intoxication, from which\r\nthey will never awake. The Men of Faith will play the cup-bearers at\r\nthis lifelong bacchanal, filling and ever filling again with the warm\r\nliquor that the Intelligences, in sad and sober privacy behind the\r\nscenes, will brew for the intoxication of their subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will be my place in the Rational State?\xe2\x80\x9d Denis drowsily\r\ninquired from under his shading hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan looked at him for a moment in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to see\r\nwhere you would fit in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do manual work;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re too independent and unsuggestible to belong to the larger Herd;\r\nyou have none of the characteristics required in a Man of Faith. As for\r\nthe Directing Intelligences, they will have to be marvellously clear and\r\nmerciless and penetrating.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can see\r\nno place for you; only the lethal chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeeply hurt, Denis emitted the imitation of a loud Homeric laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngetting sunstroke here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and got up.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan followed his example, and they walked slowly away down the\r\nnarrow path, brushing the blue lavender flowers in their passage. Denis\r\npulled a sprig of lavender and sniffed at it; then some dark leaves of\r\nrosemary that smelt like incense in a cavernous church. They passed a\r\nbed of opium poppies, dispetaled now; the round, ripe seedheads were\r\nbrown and dry--like Polynesian trophies, Denis thought; severed heads\r\nstuck on poles. He liked the fancy enough to impart it to Mr. Scogan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike Polynesian trophies...\xe2\x80\x9d Uttered aloud, the fancy seemed less\r\ncharming and significant than it did when it first occurred to him.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, and in a growing wave of sound the whir of the\r\nreaping machines swelled up from the fields beyond the garden and then\r\nreceded into a remoter hum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is satisfactory to think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, as they strolled slowly\r\nonward, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a multitude of people are toiling in the harvest fields in\r\norder that we may talk of Polynesia. Like every other good thing in this\r\nworld, leisure and culture have to be paid for. Fortunately, however,\r\nit is not the leisured and the cultured who have to pay. Let us be\r\nduly thankful for that, my dear Denis--duly thankful,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and\r\nknocked the ashes out of his pipe.\r\n\r\nDenis was not listening. He had suddenly remembered Anne. She was with\r\nGombauld--alone with him in his studio. It was an intolerable thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go and pay a call on Gombauld?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould be amusing to see what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed inwardly to think how furious Gombauld would be when he saw\r\nthem arriving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nGombauld was by no means so furious at their apparition as Denis had\r\nhoped and expected he would be. Indeed, he was rather pleased than\r\nannoyed when the two faces, one brown and pointed, the other round and\r\npale, appeared in the frame of the open door. The energy born of his\r\nrestless irritation was dying within him, returning to its emotional\r\nelements. A moment more and he would have been losing his temper\r\nagain--and Anne would be keeping hers, infuriatingly. Yes, he was\r\npositively glad to see them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he called out hospitably.\r\n\r\nFollowed by Mr. Scogan, Denis climbed the little ladder and stepped over\r\nthe threshold. He looked suspiciously from Gombauld to his sitter, and\r\ncould learn nothing from the expression of their faces except that they\r\nboth seemed pleased to see the visitors. Were they really glad, or were\r\nthey cunningly simulating gladness? He wondered.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan, meanwhile, was looking at the portrait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said approvingly, \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent. Almost too true to\r\ncharacter, if that is possible; yes, positively too true. But I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsurprised to find you putting in all this psychology business.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npointed to the face, and with his extended finger followed the slack\r\ncurves of the painted figure. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were one of the fellows who\r\nwent in exclusively for balanced masses and impinging planes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGombauld laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a little infidelity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cI for one, without ever having had\r\nthe slightest appreciation of painting, have always taken particular\r\npleasure in Cubismus. I like to see pictures from which nature has been\r\ncompletely banished, pictures which are exclusively the product of the\r\nhuman mind. They give me the same pleasure as I derive from a good piece\r\nof reasoning or a mathematical problem or an achievement of engineering.\r\nNature, or anything that reminds me of nature, disturbs me; it is\r\ntoo large, too complicated, above all too utterly pointless and\r\nincomprehensible. I am at home with the works of man; if I choose to\r\nset my mind to it, I can understand anything that any man has made or\r\nthought. That is why I always travel by Tube, never by bus if I can\r\npossibly help it. For, travelling by bus, one can\xe2\x80\x99t avoid seeing, even\r\nin London, a few stray works of God--the sky, for example, an occasional\r\ntree, the flowers in the window-boxes. But travel by Tube and you see\r\nnothing but the works of man--iron riveted into geometrical forms,\r\nstraight lines of concrete, patterned expanses of tiles. All is human\r\nand the product of friendly and comprehensible minds. All philosophies\r\nand all religions--what are they but spiritual Tubes bored through the\r\nuniverse! Through these narrow tunnels, where all is recognisably human,\r\none travels comfortable and secure, contriving to forget that all round\r\nand below and above them stretches the blind mass of earth, endless\r\nand unexplored. Yes, give me the Tube and Cubismus every time; give me\r\nideas, so snug and neat and simple and well made. And preserve me from\r\nnature, preserve me from all that\xe2\x80\x99s inhumanly large and complicated and\r\nobscure. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the courage, and, above all, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the time to\r\nstart wandering in that labyrinth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Scogan was discoursing, Denis had crossed over to the farther\r\nside of the little square chamber, where Anne was sitting, still in her\r\ngraceful, lazy pose, on the low chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, looking at her almost fiercely. What was he asking\r\nof her? He hardly knew himself.\r\n\r\nAnne looked up at him, and for answer echoed his \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d in another, a\r\nlaughing key.\r\n\r\nDenis had nothing more, at the moment, to say. Two or three canvases\r\nstood in the corner behind Anne\xe2\x80\x99s chair, their faces turned to the wall.\r\nHe pulled them out and began to look at the paintings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I see too?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne requested.\r\n\r\nHe stood them in a row against the wall. Anne had to turn round in her\r\nchair to look at them. There was the big canvas of the man fallen from\r\nthe horse, there was a painting of flowers, there was a small landscape.\r\nHis hands on the back of the chair, Denis leaned over her. From behind\r\nthe easel at the other side of the room Mr. Scogan was talking away.\r\nFor a long time they looked at the pictures, saying nothing; or, rather,\r\nAnne looked at the pictures, while Denis, for the most part, looked at\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the man and the horse; don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, looking up\r\nwith an inquiring smile.\r\n\r\nDenis nodded, and then in a queer, strangled voice, as though it had\r\ncost him a great effort to utter the words, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a remark which Anne had heard a good many times before and mostly\r\nheard with equanimity. But on this occasion--perhaps because they had\r\ncome so unexpectedly, perhaps for some other reason--the words provoked\r\nin her a certain surprised commotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Denis,\xe2\x80\x9d she managed to say, with a laugh; but she was blushing\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nIt was noon. Denis, descending from his chamber, where he had been\r\nmaking an unsuccessful effort to write something about nothing in\r\nparticular, found the drawing-room deserted. He was about to go out into\r\nthe garden when his eye fell on a familiar but mysterious object--the\r\nlarge red notebook in which he had so often seen Jenny quietly and\r\nbusily scribbling. She had left it lying on the window-seat. The\r\ntemptation was great. He picked up the book and slipped off the elastic\r\nband that kept it discreetly closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate. Not to be opened,\xe2\x80\x9d was written in capital letters on the\r\ncover. He raised his eyebrows. It was the sort of thing one wrote in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s Latin Grammar while one was still at one\xe2\x80\x99s preparatory school.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cBlack is the raven, black is the rook,\r\n\r\n               But blacker the thief who steals this book!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was curiously childish, he thought, and he smiled to himself. He\r\nopened the book. What he saw made him wince as though he had been\r\nstruck.\r\n\r\nDenis was his own severest critic; so, at least, he had always believed.\r\nHe liked to think of himself as a merciless vivisector probing into the\r\npalpitating entrails of his own soul; he was Brown Dog to himself.\r\nHis weaknesses, his absurdities--no one knew them better than he did.\r\nIndeed, in a vague way he imagined that nobody beside himself was aware\r\nof them at all. It seemed, somehow, inconceivable that he should appear\r\nto other people as they appeared to him; inconceivable that they ever\r\nspoke of him among themselves in that same freely critical and, to be\r\nquite honest, mildly malicious tone in which he was accustomed to talk\r\nof them. In his own eyes he had defects, but to see them was a privilege\r\nreserved to him alone. For the rest of the world he was surely an image\r\nof flawless crystal. It was almost axiomatic.\r\n\r\nOn opening the red notebook that crystal image of himself crashed to\r\nthe ground, and was irreparably shattered. He was not his own severest\r\ncritic after all. The discovery was a painful one.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s unobtrusive scribbling lay before him. A caricature\r\nof himself, reading (the book was upside-down). In the background a\r\ndancing couple, recognisable as Gombauld and Anne. Beneath, the legend:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFable of the Wallflower and the Sour Grapes.\xe2\x80\x9d Fascinated and horrified,\r\nDenis pored over the drawing. It was masterful. A mute, inglorious\r\nRouveyre appeared in every one of those cruelly clear lines. The\r\nexpression of the face, an assumed aloofness and superiority tempered\r\nby a feeble envy; the attitude of the body and limbs, an attitude of\r\nstudious and scholarly dignity, given away by the fidgety pose of the\r\nturned-in feet--these things were terrible. And, more terrible still,\r\nwas the likeness, was the magisterial certainty with which his physical\r\npeculiarities were all recorded and subtly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nDenis looked deeper into the book. There were caricatures of other\r\npeople: of Priscilla and Mr. Barbecue-Smith; of Henry Wimbush, of Anne\r\nand Gombauld; of Mr. Scogan, whom Jenny had represented in a light that\r\nwas more than slightly sinister, that was, indeed, diabolic; of Mary and\r\nIvor. He scarcely glanced at them. A fearful desire to know the worst\r\nabout himself possessed him. He turned over the leaves, lingering at\r\nnothing that was not his own image. Seven full pages were devoted to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate. Not to be opened.\xe2\x80\x9d He had disobeyed the injunction; he had\r\nonly got what he deserved. Thoughtfully he closed the book, and slid the\r\nrubber band once more into its place. Sadder and wiser, he went out on\r\nto the terrace. And so this, he reflected, this was how Jenny employed\r\nthe leisure hours in her ivory tower apart. And he had thought her a\r\nsimple-minded, uncritical creature! It was he, it seemed, who was the\r\nfool. He felt no resentment towards Jenny. No, the distressing thing\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t Jenny herself; it was what she and the phenomenon of her red\r\nbook represented, what they stood for and concretely symbolised. They\r\nrepresented all the vast conscious world of men outside himself; they\r\nsymbolised something that in his studious solitariness he was apt not to\r\nbelieve in. He could stand at Piccadilly Circus, could watch the\r\ncrowds shuffle past, and still imagine himself the one fully conscious,\r\nintelligent, individual being among all those thousands. It seemed,\r\nsomehow, impossible that other people should be in their way as\r\nelaborate and complete as he in his. Impossible; and yet, periodically\r\nhe would make some painful discovery about the external world and the\r\nhorrible reality of its consciousness and its intelligence. The red\r\nnotebook was one of these discoveries, a footprint in the sand. It put\r\nbeyond a doubt the fact that the outer world really existed.\r\n\r\nSitting on the balustrade of the terrace, he ruminated this unpleasant\r\ntruth for some time. Still chewing on it, he strolled pensively down\r\ntowards the swimming-pool. A peacock and his hen trailed their shabby\r\nfinery across the turf of the lower lawn. Odious birds! Their necks,\r\nthick and greedily fleshy at the roots, tapered up to the cruel inanity\r\nof their brainless heads, their flat eyes and piercing beaks. The\r\nfabulists were right, he reflected, when they took beasts to illustrate\r\ntheir tractates of human morality. Animals resemble men with all the\r\ntruthfulness of a caricature. (Oh, the red notebook!) He threw a piece\r\nof stick at the slowly pacing birds. They rushed towards it, thinking it\r\nwas something to eat.\r\n\r\nHe walked on. The profound shade of a giant ilex tree engulfed him. Like\r\na great wooden octopus, it spread its long arms abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cUnder the spreading ilex tree...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to remember who the poem was by, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cThe smith, a brawny man is he,\r\n\r\n               With arms like rubber bands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust like his; he would have to try and do his Muller exercises more\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\nHe emerged once more into the sunshine. The pool lay before him,\r\nreflecting in its bronze mirror the blue and various green of the\r\nsummer day. Looking at it, he thought of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s bare arms and seal-sleek\r\nbathing-dress, her moving knees and feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cAnd little Luce with the white legs,\r\n\r\n               And bouncing Barbary...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, these rags and tags of other people\xe2\x80\x99s making! Would he ever be able\r\nto call his brain his own? Was there, indeed, anything in it that was\r\ntruly his own, or was it simply an education?\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly round the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. In an embayed recess among\r\nthe surrounding yew trees, leaning her back against the pedestal of a\r\npleasantly comic version of the Medici Venus, executed by some nameless\r\nmason of the seicento, he saw Mary pensively sitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, for he was passing so close to her that he had to say\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nMary looked up. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered in a melancholy, uninterested\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nIn this alcove hewed out of the dark trees, the atmosphere seemed to\r\nDenis agreeably elegiac. He sat down beside her under the shadow of the\r\npudic goddess. There was a prolonged silence.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast that morning Mary had found on her plate a picture postcard\r\nof Gobley Great Park. A stately Georgian pile, with a facade sixteen\r\nwindows wide; parterres in the foreground; huge, smooth lawns receding\r\nout of the picture to right and left. Ten years more of the hard times\r\nand Gobley, with all its peers, will be deserted and decaying. Fifty\r\nyears, and the countryside will know the old landmarks no more. They\r\nwill have vanished as the monasteries vanished before them. At the\r\nmoment, however, Mary\xe2\x80\x99s mind was not moved by these considerations.\r\n\r\nOn the back of the postcard, next to the address, was written, in Ivor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbold, large hand, a single quatrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cHail, maid of moonlight! Bride of the sun, farewell!\r\n\r\n               Like bright plumes moulted in an angel\xe2\x80\x99s flight,\r\n\r\n          There sleep within my heart\xe2\x80\x99s most mystic cell\r\n\r\n               Memories of morning, memories of the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere followed a postscript of three lines: \xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind asking one\r\nof the housemaids to forward the packet of safety-razor blades I left in\r\nthe drawer of my washstand. Thanks.--Ivor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeated under the Venus\xe2\x80\x99s immemorial gesture, Mary considered life\r\nand love. The abolition of her repressions, so far from bringing the\r\nexpected peace of mind, had brought nothing but disquiet, a new and\r\nhitherto unexperienced misery. Ivor, Ivor...She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without him\r\nnow. It was evident, on the other hand, from the poem on the back of the\r\npicture postcard, that Ivor could very well do without her. He was at\r\nGobley now, so was Zenobia. Mary knew Zenobia. She thought of the last\r\nverse of the song he had sung that night in the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cLe lendemain, Phillis peu sage\r\n\r\n               Aurait donne moutons et chien\r\n\r\n               Pour un baiser que le volage\r\n\r\n               A Lisette donnait pour rien.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary shed tears at the memory; she had never been so unhappy in all her\r\nlife before.\r\n\r\nIt was Denis who first broke the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe individual,\xe2\x80\x9d he began in\r\na soft and sadly philosophical tone, \xe2\x80\x9cis not a self-supporting universe.\r\nThere are times when he comes into contact with other individuals, when\r\nhe is forced to take cognisance of the existence of other universes\r\nbesides himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had contrived this highly abstract generalisation as a preliminary\r\nto a personal confidence. It was the first gambit in a conversation that\r\nwas to lead up to Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s caricatures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary; and, generalising for herself, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen one\r\nindividual comes into intimate contact with another, she--or he, of\r\ncourse, as the case may be--must almost inevitably receive or inflict\r\nsuffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is apt,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto be so spellbound by the spectacle of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own personality that one forgets that the spectacle presents\r\nitself to other people as well as to oneself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was not listening. \xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes itself\r\nacutely felt in matters of sex. If one individual seeks intimate contact\r\nwith another individual in the natural way, she is certain to receive or\r\ninflict suffering. If on the other hand, she avoids contacts, she risks\r\nthe equally grave sufferings that follow on unnatural repressions. As\r\nyou see, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dilemma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think of my own case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, making a more decided move in\r\nthe desired direction, \xe2\x80\x9cI am amazed how ignorant I am of other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmentality in general, and above all and in particular, of their opinions\r\nabout myself. Our minds are sealed books only occasionally opened to\r\nthe outside world.\xe2\x80\x9d He made a gesture that was faintly suggestive of the\r\ndrawing off of a rubber band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an awful problem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has to have had\r\npersonal experience to realise quite how awful it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d Denis nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has to have had first-hand experience.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nleaned towards her and slightly lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThis very morning,\r\nfor example...\xe2\x80\x9d he began, but his confidences were cut short. The deep\r\nvoice of the gong, tempered by distance to a pleasant booming, floated\r\ndown from the house. It was lunch-time. Mechanically Mary rose to her\r\nfeet, and Denis, a little hurt that she should exhibit such a desperate\r\nanxiety for her food and so slight an interest in his spiritual\r\nexperiences, followed her. They made their way up to the house without\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nI hope you all realise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush during dinner, \xe2\x80\x9cthat next\r\nMonday is Bank Holiday, and that you will all be expected to help in the\r\nFair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fair--I had forgotten all about it. What a\r\nnightmare! Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you put a stop to it, Uncle Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wimbush sighed and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAlas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear I\r\ncannot. I should have liked to put an end to it years ago; but the\r\nclaims of Charity are strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not charity we want,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne murmured rebelliously; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wimbush went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fair has become an institution. Let\r\nme see, it must be twenty-two years since we started it. It was a modest\r\naffair then. Now...\xe2\x80\x9d he made a sweeping movement with his hand and was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nIt spoke highly for Mr. Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s public spirit that he still continued\r\nto tolerate the Fair. Beginning as a sort of glorified church\r\nbazaar, Crome\xe2\x80\x99s yearly Charity Fair had grown into a noisy thing of\r\nmerry-go-rounds, cocoanut shies, and miscellaneous side shows--a real\r\ngenuine fair on the grand scale. It was the local St. Bartholomew, and\r\nthe people of all the neighbouring villages, with even a contingent from\r\nthe county town, flocked into the park for their Bank Holiday amusement.\r\nThe local hospital profited handsomely, and it was this fact alone which\r\nprevented Mr. Wimbush, to whom the Fair was a cause of recurrent and\r\nnever-diminishing agony, from putting a stop to the nuisance which\r\nyearly desecrated his park and garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made all the arrangements already,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Wimbush went on. \xe2\x80\x9cSome\r\nof the larger marquees will be put up to-morrow. The swings and the\r\nmerry-go-round arrive on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no escape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, turning to the rest of the party.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll all have to do something. As a special favour you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed\r\nto choose your slavery. My job is the tea tent, as usual, Aunt\r\nPriscilla...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wimbush, interrupting her, \xe2\x80\x9cI have more important\r\nthings to think about than the Fair. But you need have no doubt that I\r\nshall do my best when Monday comes to encourage the villagers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cAunt Priscilla will encourage the\r\nvillagers. What will you do, Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything where I have to stand by and watch other people\r\neat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll look after the children\xe2\x80\x99s sports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll look after the children\xe2\x80\x99s sports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Scogan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I be allowed to tell fortunes?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I should be good at telling fortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell fortunes in that costume!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan surveyed himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be dressed up. Do you still persist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to suffer all indignities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne; and turning to Gombauld, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be our lightning\r\nartist,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Your portrait for a shilling in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity I\xe2\x80\x99m not Ivor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gombauld, with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI could throw\r\nin a picture of their Auras for an extra sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is to be gained,\xe2\x80\x9d she said severely, \xe2\x80\x9cby speaking\r\nwith levity of serious subjects. And, after all, whatever your personal\r\nviews may be, psychical research is a perfectly serious subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about Denis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis made a deprecating gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no accomplishments,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just be one of those men who wear a thing in their buttonholes and\r\ngo about telling people which is the way to tea and not to walk on the\r\ngrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do. You must do something more than\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what? All the good jobs are taken, and I can do nothing but lisp in\r\nnumbers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you must lisp,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must write a poem for\r\nthe occasion--an \xe2\x80\x98Ode on Bank Holiday.\xe2\x80\x99 We\xe2\x80\x99ll print it on Uncle Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npress and sell it at twopence a copy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixpence,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis protested. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be worth sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cTwopence,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody will pay\r\nmore than twopence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now there\xe2\x80\x99s Jenny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wimbush. \xe2\x80\x9cJenny,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, raising his\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis thought of suggesting that she might draw caricatures at sixpence\r\nan execution, but decided it would be wiser to go on feigning ignorance\r\nof her talent. His mind reverted to the red notebook. Could it really be\r\ntrue that he looked like that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will I do,\xe2\x80\x9d Jenny echoed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will I do?\xe2\x80\x9d She frowned\r\nthoughtfully for a moment; then her face brightened and she smiled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was young,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI learnt to play the drums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe drums?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJenny nodded, and, in proof of her assertion, agitated her knife\r\nand fork, like a pair of drumsticks, over her plate. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s any\r\nopportunity of playing the drums...\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s any amount of opportunity. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nput you down definitely for the drums. That\xe2\x80\x99s the lot,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very good lot too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gombauld. \xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to my Bank\r\nHoliday. It ought to be gay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ought indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Scogan assented. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you may rest assured that it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be. No holiday is ever anything but a disappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Gombauld. \xe2\x80\x9cMy holiday at Crome isn\xe2\x80\x99t being a\r\ndisappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne turned an ingenuous mask towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the very nature of things,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan went on; \xe2\x80\x9cour holidays\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help being disappointments. Reflect for a moment. What is a\r\nholiday? The ideal, the Platonic Holiday of Holidays is surely a\r\ncomplete and absolute change. You agree with me in my definition?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nScogan glanced from face to face round the table; his sharp nose moved\r\nin a series of rapid jerks through all the points of the compass. There\r\nwas no sign of dissent; he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cA complete and absolute change;\r\nvery well. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t a complete and absolute change precisely the thing\r\nwe can never have--never, in the very nature of things?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan\r\nonce more looked rapidly about him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is. As ourselves, as\r\nspecimens of Homo Sapiens, as members of a society, how can we hope to\r\nhave anything like an absolute change? We are tied down by the frightful\r\nlimitation of our human faculties, by the notions which society imposes\r\non us through our fatal suggestibility, by our own personalities. For\r\nus, a complete holiday is out of the question. Some of us struggle\r\nmanfully to take one, but we never succeed, if I may be allowed to\r\nexpress myself metaphorically, we never succeed in getting farther than\r\nSouthend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re depressing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to be,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan replied, and, expanding the fingers of his\r\nright hand, he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me, for example. What sort of a holiday\r\ncan I take? In endowing me with passions and faculties Nature has been\r\nhorribly niggardly. The full range of human potentialities is in\r\nany case distressingly limited; my range is a limitation within a\r\nlimitation. Out of the ten octaves that make up the human instrument,\r\nI can compass perhaps two. Thus, while I may have a certain amount\r\nof intelligence, I have no aesthetic sense; while I possess the\r\nmathematical faculty, I am wholly without the religious emotions; while\r\nI am naturally addicted to venery, I have little ambition and am not\r\nat all avaricious. Education has further limited my scope. Having been\r\nbrought up in society, I am impregnated with its laws; not only should\r\nI be afraid of taking a holiday from them, I should also feel it painful\r\nto try to do so. In a word, I have a conscience as well as a fear of\r\ngaol. Yes, I know it by experience. How often have I tried to take\r\nholidays, to get away from myself, my own boring nature, my insufferable\r\nmental surroundings!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut always without\r\nsuccess,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9calways without success. In my youth I was always\r\nstriving--how hard!--to feel religiously and aesthetically. Here, said\r\nI to myself, are two tremendously important and exciting emotions. Life\r\nwould be richer, warmer, brighter, altogether more amusing, if I could\r\nfeel them. I try to feel them. I read the works of the mystics. They\r\nseemed to me nothing but the most deplorable claptrap--as indeed they\r\nalways must to anyone who does not feel the same emotion as the authors\r\nfelt when they were writing. For it is the emotion that matters. The\r\nwritten work is simply an attempt to express emotion, which is in itself\r\ninexpressible, in terms of intellect and logic. The mystic objectifies\r\na rich feeling in the pit of the stomach into a cosmology. For other\r\nmystics that cosmology is a symbol of the rich feeling. For the\r\nunreligious it is a symbol of nothing, and so appears merely grotesque.\r\nA melancholy fact! But I divagate.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan checked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much\r\nfor the religious emotion. As for the aesthetic--I was at even greater\r\npains to cultivate that. I have looked at all the right works of art\r\nin every part of Europe. There was a time when, I venture to believe,\r\nI knew more about Taddeo da Poggibonsi, more about the cryptic Amico\r\ndi Taddeo, even than Henry does. To-day, I am happy to say, I have\r\nforgotten most of the knowledge I then so laboriously acquired; but\r\nwithout vanity I can assert that it was prodigious. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend, of\r\ncourse, to know anything about nigger sculpture or the later seventeenth\r\ncentury in Italy; but about all the periods that were fashionable before\r\n1900 I am, or was, omniscient. Yes, I repeat it, omniscient. But did\r\nthat fact make me any more appreciative of art in general? It did not.\r\nConfronted by a picture, of which I could tell you all the known and\r\npresumed history--the date when it was painted, the character of the\r\npainter, the influences that had gone to make it what it was--I felt\r\nnone of that strange excitement and exaltation which is, as I am\r\ninformed by those who do feel it, the true aesthetic emotion. I felt\r\nnothing but a certain interest in the subject of the picture; or more\r\noften, when the subject was hackneyed and religious, I felt nothing but\r\na great weariness of spirit. Nevertheless, I must have gone on looking\r\nat pictures for ten years before I would honestly admit to myself that\r\nthey merely bored me. Since then I have given up all attempts to take\r\na holiday. I go on cultivating my old stale daily self in the resigned\r\nspirit with which a bank clerk performs from ten till six his daily\r\ntask. A holiday, indeed! I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you, Gombauld, if you still look\r\nforward to having a holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGombauld shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy standards\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t as elevated as yours. But personally I found the war quite as\r\nthorough a holiday from all the ordinary decencies and sanities, all the\r\ncommon emotions and preoccupations, as I ever want to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan thoughtfully agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the war was certainly\r\nsomething of a holiday. It was a step beyond Southend; it was\r\nWeston-super-Mare; it was almost Ilfracombe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nA little canvas village of tents and booths had sprung up, just beyond\r\nthe boundaries of the garden, in the green expanse of the park. A crowd\r\nthronged its streets, the men dressed mostly in black--holiday best,\r\nfuneral best--the women in pale muslins. Here and there tricolour\r\nbunting hung inert. In the midst of the canvas town, scarlet and gold\r\nand crystal, the merry-go-round glittered in the sun. The balloon-man\r\nwalked among the crowd, and above his head, like a huge, inverted\r\nbunch of many-coloured grapes, the balloons strained upwards. With a\r\nscythe-like motion the boat-swings reaped the air, and from the funnel\r\nof the engine which worked the roundabout rose a thin, scarcely wavering\r\ncolumn of black smoke.\r\n\r\nDenis had climbed to the top of one of Sir Ferdinando\xe2\x80\x99s towers, and\r\nthere, standing on the sun-baked leads, his elbows resting on the\r\nparapet, he surveyed the scene. The steam-organ sent up prodigious\r\nmusic. The clashing of automatic cymbals beat out with inexorable\r\nprecision the rhythm of piercingly sounded melodies. The harmonies were\r\nlike a musical shattering of glass and brass. Far down in the bass\r\nthe Last Trump was hugely blowing, and with such persistence, such\r\nresonance, that its alternate tonic and dominant detached themselves\r\nfrom the rest of the music and made a tune of their own, a loud,\r\nmonotonous see-saw.\r\n\r\nDenis leaned over the gulf of swirling noise. If he threw himself over\r\nthe parapet, the noise would surely buoy him up, keep him suspended,\r\nbobbing, as a fountain balances a ball on its breaking crest. Another\r\nfancy came to him, this time in metrical form.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cMy soul is a thin white sheet of parchment stretched\r\n\r\n               Over a bubbling cauldron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBad, bad. But he liked the idea of something thin and distended being\r\nblown up from underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cMy soul is a thin tent of gut...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nor better--\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cMy soul is a pale, tenuous membrane...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was pleasing: a thin, tenuous membrane. It had the right anatomical\r\nquality. Tight blown, quivering in the blast of noisy life. It was time\r\nfor him to descend from the serene empyrean of words into the actual\r\nvortex. He went down slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy soul is a thin, tenuous membrane...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the terrace stood a knot of distinguished visitors. There was old\r\nLord Moleyn, like a caricature of an English milord in a French comic\r\npaper: a long man, with a long nose and long, drooping moustaches and\r\nlong teeth of old ivory, and lower down, absurdly, a short covert coat,\r\nand below that long, long legs cased in pearl-grey trousers--legs that\r\nbent unsteadily at the knee and gave a kind of sideways wobble as\r\nhe walked. Beside him, short and thick-set, stood Mr. Callamay, the\r\nvenerable conservative statesman, with a face like a Roman bust, and\r\nshort white hair. Young girls didn\xe2\x80\x99t much like going for motor drives\r\nalone with Mr. Callamay; and of old Lord Moleyn one wondered why he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t living in gilded exile on the island of Capri among the other\r\ndistinguished persons who, for one reason or another, find it impossible\r\nto live in England. They were talking to Anne, laughing, the one\r\nprofoundly, the other hootingly.\r\n\r\nA black silk balloon towing a black-and-white striped parachute proved\r\nto be old Mrs. Budge from the big house on the other side of the valley.\r\nShe stood low on the ground, and the spikes of her black-and-white\r\nsunshade menaced the eyes of Priscilla Wimbush, who towered over her--a\r\nmassive figure dressed in purple and topped with a queenly toque on\r\nwhich the nodding black plumes recalled the splendours of a first-class\r\nParisian funeral.\r\n\r\nDenis peeped at them discreetly from the window of the morning-room.\r\nHis eyes were suddenly become innocent, childlike, unprejudiced. They\r\nseemed, these people, inconceivably fantastic. And yet they really\r\nexisted, they functioned by themselves, they were conscious, they\r\nhad minds. Moreover, he was like them. Could one believe it? But the\r\nevidence of the red notebook was conclusive.\r\n\r\nIt would have been polite to go and say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do?\xe2\x80\x9d But at the\r\nmoment Denis did not want to talk, could not have talked. His soul was a\r\ntenuous, tremulous, pale membrane. He would keep its sensibility intact\r\nand virgin as long as he could. Cautiously he crept out by a side\r\ndoor and made his way down towards the park. His soul fluttered as he\r\napproached the noise and movement of the fair. He paused for a moment on\r\nthe brink, then stepped in and was engulfed.\r\n\r\nHundreds of people, each with his own private face and all of them real,\r\nseparate, alive: the thought was disquieting. He paid twopence and saw\r\nthe Tatooed Woman; twopence more, the Largest Rat in the World. From the\r\nhome of the Rat he emerged just in time to see a hydrogen-filled balloon\r\nbreak loose for home. A child howled up after it; but calmly, a perfect\r\nsphere of flushed opal, it mounted, mounted. Denis followed it with his\r\neyes until it became lost in the blinding sunlight. If he could but send\r\nhis soul to follow it!...\r\n\r\nHe sighed, stuck his steward\xe2\x80\x99s rosette in his buttonhole, and started to\r\npush his way, aimlessly but officially, through the crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan had been accommodated in a little canvas hut. Dressed in a\r\nblack skirt and a red bodice, with a yellow-and-red bandana handkerchief\r\ntied round his black wig, he looked--sharp-nosed, brown, and\r\nwrinkled--like the Bohemian Hag of Frith\xe2\x80\x99s Derby Day. A placard pinned\r\nto the curtain of the doorway announced the presence within the tent of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSesostris, the Sorceress of Ecbatana.\xe2\x80\x9d Seated at a table, Mr. Scogan\r\nreceived his clients in mysterious silence, indicating with a movement\r\nof the finger that they were to sit down opposite him and to extend\r\ntheir hands for his inspection. He then examined the palm that was\r\npresented him, using a magnifying glass and a pair of horn spectacles.\r\nHe had a terrifying way of shaking his head, frowning and clicking with\r\nhis tongue as he looked at the lines. Sometimes he would whisper, as\r\nthough to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cTerrible, terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cGod preserve us!\xe2\x80\x9d sketching\r\nout the sign of the cross as he uttered the words. The clients who came\r\nin laughing grew suddenly grave; they began to take the witch seriously.\r\nShe was a formidable-looking woman; could it be, was it possible, that\r\nthere was something in this sort of thing after all? After all, they\r\nthought, as the hag shook her head over their hands, after all...And\r\nthey waited, with an uncomfortably beating heart, for the oracle to\r\nspeak. After a long and silent inspection, Mr. Scogan would suddenly\r\nlook up and ask, in a hoarse whisper, some horrifying question, such as,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been hit on the head with a hammer by a young man with\r\nred hair?\xe2\x80\x9d When the answer was in the negative, which it could hardly\r\nfail to be, Mr. Scogan would nod several times, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid\r\nso. Everything is still to come, still to come, though it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nvery far off now.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes, after a long examination, he would just\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere ignorance is bliss, \xe2\x80\x98tis folly to be wise,\xe2\x80\x9d and refuse\r\nto divulge any details of a future too appalling to be envisaged without\r\ndespair. Sesostris had a success of horror. People stood in a queue\r\noutside the witch\xe2\x80\x99s booth waiting for the privilege of hearing sentence\r\npronounced upon them.\r\n\r\nDenis, in the course of his round, looked with curiosity at this crowd\r\nof suppliants before the shrine of the oracle. He had a great desire\r\nto see how Mr. Scogan played his part. The canvas booth was a rickety,\r\nill-made structure. Between its walls and its sagging roof were long\r\ngaping chinks and crannies. Denis went to the tea-tent and borrowed a\r\nwooden bench and a small Union Jack. With these he hurried back to the\r\nbooth of Sesostris. Setting down the bench at the back of the booth,\r\nhe climbed up, and with a great air of busy efficiency began to tie the\r\nUnion Jack to the top of one of the tent-poles. Through the crannies in\r\nthe canvas he could see almost the whole of the interior of the tent.\r\nMr. Scogan\xe2\x80\x99s bandana-covered head was just below him; his terrifying\r\nwhispers came clearly up. Denis looked and listened while the witch\r\nprophesied financial losses, death by apoplexy, destruction by air-raids\r\nin the next war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there going to be another war?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old lady to whom he had\r\npredicted this end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, with an air of quiet confidence.\r\n\r\nThe old lady was succeeded by a girl dressed in white muslin, garnished\r\nwith pink ribbons. She was wearing a broad hat, so that Denis could not\r\nsee her face; but from her figure and the roundness of her bare arms\r\nhe judged her young and pleasing. Mr. Scogan looked at her hand, then\r\nwhispered, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are still virtuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady giggled and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, lor\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will not remain so for long,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Scogan sepulchrally.\r\nThe young lady giggled again. \xe2\x80\x9cDestiny, which interests itself in small\r\nthings no less than in great, has announced the fact upon your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mr. Scogan took up the magnifying-glass and began once more to examine\r\nthe white palm. \xe2\x80\x9cVery interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as though to himself--\xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\ninteresting. It\xe2\x80\x99s as clear as day.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s clear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ought to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan shook his head; the\r\npendulous brass ear-rings which he had screwed on to his ears tinkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, please!\xe2\x80\x9d she implored.\r\n\r\nThe witch seemed to ignore her remark. \xe2\x80\x9cAfterwards, it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all\r\nclear. The fates don\xe2\x80\x99t say whether you will settle down to married life\r\nand have four children or whether you will try to go on the cinema\r\nand have none. They are only specific about this one rather crucial\r\nincident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What is it? Oh, do tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe white muslin figure leant eagerly forward.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you must know, you\r\nmust know. But if anything untoward happens you must blame your\r\nown curiosity. Listen. Listen.\xe2\x80\x9d He lifted up a sharp, claw-nailed\r\nforefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what the fates have written. Next Sunday afternoon\r\nat six o\xe2\x80\x99clock you will be sitting on the second stile on the footpath\r\nthat leads from the church to the lower road. At that moment a man will\r\nappear walking along the footpath.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan looked at her hand again\r\nas though to refresh his memory of the details of the scene. \xe2\x80\x9cA man,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated--\xe2\x80\x9ca small man with a sharp nose, not exactly good looking nor\r\nprecisely young, but fascinating.\xe2\x80\x9d He lingered hissingly over the word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will ask you, \xe2\x80\x98Can you tell me the way to Paradise?\xe2\x80\x99 and you will\r\nanswer, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you,\xe2\x80\x99 and walk with him down towards the little\r\nhazel copse. I cannot read what will happen after that.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really true?\xe2\x80\x9d asked white muslin.\r\n\r\nThe witch gave a shrug of the shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cI merely tell you what I read\r\nin your hand. Good afternoon. That will be sixpence. Yes, I have change.\r\nThank you. Good afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis stepped down from the bench; tied insecurely and crookedly to the\r\ntentpole, the Union Jack hung limp on the windless air. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I could\r\ndo things like that!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he carried the bench back to the\r\ntea-tent.\r\n\r\nAnne was sitting behind a long table filling thick white cups from an\r\nurn. A neat pile of printed sheets lay before her on the table. Denis\r\ntook one of them and looked at it affectionately. It was his poem. They\r\nhad printed five hundred copies, and very nice the quarto broadsheets\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you sold many?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in a casual tone.\r\n\r\nAnne put her head on one side deprecatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly three so far, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid. But I\xe2\x80\x99m giving a free copy to everyone who spends more than a\r\nshilling on his tea. So in any case it\xe2\x80\x99s having a circulation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis made no reply, but walked slowly away. He looked at the broadsheet\r\nin his hand and read the lines to himself relishingly as he walked\r\nalong:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cThis day of roundabouts and swings,\r\n\r\n               Struck weights, shied cocoa-nuts, tossed rings,\r\n\r\n               Switchbacks, Aunt Sallies, and all such small\r\n\r\n               High jinks--you call it ferial?\r\n\r\n               A holiday? But paper noses\r\n\r\n               Sniffed the artificial roses\r\n\r\n               Of round Venetian cheeks through half\r\n\r\n               Each carnival year, and masks might laugh\r\n\r\n               At things the naked face for shame\r\n\r\n               Would blush at--laugh and think no blame.\r\n\r\n               A holiday? But Galba showed\r\n\r\n               Elephants on an airy road;\r\n\r\n               Jumbo trod the tightrope then,\r\n\r\n               And in the circus armed men\r\n\r\n               Stabbed home for sport and died to break\r\n\r\n               Those dull imperatives that make\r\n\r\n               A prison of every working day,\r\n\r\n               Where all must drudge and all obey.\r\n\r\n               Sing Holiday! You do not know\r\n\r\n               How to be free. The Russian snow\r\n\r\n               Flowered with bright blood whose roses spread\r\n\r\n               Petals of fading, fading red\r\n\r\n               That died into the snow again,\r\n\r\n               Into the virgin snow; and men\r\n\r\n               From all ancient bonds were freed.\r\n\r\n               Old law, old custom, and old creed,\r\n\r\n               Old right and wrong there bled to death;\r\n\r\n               The frozen air received their breath,\r\n\r\n               A little smoke that died away;\r\n\r\n               And round about them where they lay\r\n\r\n               The snow bloomed roses. Blood was there\r\n\r\n               A red gay flower and only fair.\r\n\r\n               Sing Holiday! Beneath the Tree\r\n\r\n               Of Innocence and Liberty,\r\n\r\n               Paper Nose and Red Cockade\r\n\r\n               Dance within the magic shade\r\n\r\n               That makes them drunken, merry, and strong\r\n\r\n               To laugh and sing their ferial song:\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x98Free, free...!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                   But Echo answers\r\n\r\n               Faintly to the laughing dancers,\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x98Free\xe2\x80\x99--and faintly laughs, and still,\r\n\r\n               Within the hollows of the hill,\r\n\r\n               Faintlier laughs and whispers, \xe2\x80\x98Free,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n               Fadingly, diminishingly:\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x98Free,\xe2\x80\x99 and laughter faints away...\r\n\r\n               Sing Holiday! Sing Holiday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe folded the sheet carefully and put it in his pocket. The thing had\r\nits merits. Oh, decidedly, decidedly! But how unpleasant the crowd\r\nsmelt! He lit a cigarette. The smell of cows was preferable. He passed\r\nthrough the gate in the park wall into the garden. The swimming-pool was\r\na centre of noise and activity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond Heat in the Young Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Championship.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the polite\r\nvoice of Henry Wimbush. A crowd of sleek, seal-like figures in black\r\nbathing-dresses surrounded him. His grey bowler hat, smooth, round, and\r\nmotionless in the midst of a moving sea, was an island of aristocratic\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\nHolding his tortoise-shell-rimmed pince-nez an inch or two in front of\r\nhis eyes, he read out names from a list.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dolly Miles, Miss Rebecca Balister, Miss Doris Gabell...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive young persons ranged themselves on the brink. From their seats of\r\nhonour at the other end of the pool, old Lord Moleyn and Mr. Callamay\r\nlooked on with eager interest.\r\n\r\nHenry Wimbush raised his hand. There was an expectant silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x98Go,\xe2\x80\x99 go. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. There was an almost simultaneous splash.\r\n\r\nDenis pushed his way through the spectators. Somebody plucked him by the\r\nsleeve; he looked down. It was old Mrs. Budge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted to see you again, Mr. Stone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in her rich, husky\r\nvoice. She panted a little as she spoke, like a short-winded lap-dog.\r\nIt was Mrs. Budge who, having read in the \xe2\x80\x9cDaily Mirror\xe2\x80\x9d that the\r\nGovernment needed peach stones--what they needed them for she never\r\nknew--had made the collection of peach stones her peculiar \xe2\x80\x9cbit\xe2\x80\x9d of war\r\nwork. She had thirty-six peach trees in her walled garden, as well as\r\nfour hot-houses in which trees could be forced, so that she was able\r\nto eat peaches practically the whole year round. In 1916 she ate 4200\r\npeaches, and sent the stones to the Government. In 1917 the military\r\nauthorities called up three of her gardeners, and what with this and the\r\nfact that it was a bad year for wall fruit, she only managed to eat 2900\r\npeaches during that crucial period of the national destinies. In 1918\r\nshe did rather better, for between January 1st and the date of the\r\nArmistice she ate 3300 peaches. Since the Armistice she had relaxed her\r\nefforts; now she did not eat more than two or three peaches a day. Her\r\nconstitution, she complained, had suffered; but it had suffered for a\r\ngood cause.\r\n\r\nDenis answered her greeting by a vague and polite noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo nice to see the young people enjoying themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Budge went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the old people too, for that matter. Look at old Lord Moleyn\r\nand dear Mr. Callamay. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it delightful to see the way they enjoy\r\nthemselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis looked. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure whether it was so very delightful after\r\nall. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they go and watch the sack races? The two old gentlemen\r\nwere engaged at the moment in congratulating the winner of the race; it\r\nseemed an act of supererogatory graciousness; for, after all, she had\r\nonly won a heat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty little thing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Budge huskily, and panted\r\ntwo or three times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis nodded agreement. Sixteen, slender, but nubile, he said to\r\nhimself, and laid up the phrase in his memory as a happy one. Old Mr.\r\nCallamay had put on his spectacles to congratulate the victor, and Lord\r\nMoleyn, leaning forward over his walking-stick, showed his long ivory\r\nteeth, hungrily smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital performance, capital,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Callamay was saying in his deep\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe victor wriggled with embarrassment. She stood with her hands behind\r\nher back, rubbing one foot nervously on the other. Her wet bathing-dress\r\nshone, a torso of black polished marble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Moleyn. His voice seemed to come from just\r\nbehind his teeth, a toothy voice. It was as though a dog should suddenly\r\nbegin to speak. He smiled again, Mr. Callamay readjusted his spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say \xe2\x80\x98Go,\xe2\x80\x99 go. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSplash! The third heat had started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I never could learn to swim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Budge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I used to be able to float.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis imagined her floating--up and down, up and down on a great green\r\nswell. A blown black bladder; no, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good at\r\nall. A new winner was being congratulated. She was atrociously stubby\r\nand fat. The last one, long and harmoniously, continuously curved from\r\nknee to breast, had been an Eve by Cranach; but this, this one was a bad\r\nRubens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c...go--go--go!\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Wimbush\xe2\x80\x99s polite level voice once more pronounced\r\nthe formula. Another batch of young ladies dived in.\r\n\r\nGrown a little weary of sustaining a conversation with Mrs. Budge,\r\nDenis conveniently remembered that his duties as a steward called him\r\nelsewhere. He pushed out through the lines of spectators and made his\r\nway along the path left clear behind them. He was thinking again that\r\nhis soul was a pale, tenuous membrane, when he was startled by hearing\r\na thin, sibilant voice, speaking apparently from just above his head,\r\npronounce the single word \xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up sharply. The path along which he was walking passed under\r\nthe lee of a wall of clipped yew. Behind the hedge the ground sloped\r\nsteeply up towards the foot of the terrace and the house; for one\r\nstanding on the higher ground it was easy to look over the dark barrier.\r\nLooking up, Denis saw two heads overtopping the hedge immediately above\r\nhim. He recognised the iron mask of Mr. Bodiham and the pale, colourless\r\nface of his wife. They were looking over his head, over the heads of the\r\nspectators, at the swimmers in the pond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bodiham repeated, hissing softly.\r\n\r\nThe rector turned up his iron mask towards the solid cobalt of the sky.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as though to himself; \xe2\x80\x9chow long?\xe2\x80\x9d He lowered his\r\neyes again, and they fell on Denis\xe2\x80\x99s upturned curious face. There was an\r\nabrupt movement, and Mr. and Mrs. Bodiham popped out of sight behind the\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\nDenis continued his promenade. He wandered past the merry-go-round,\r\nthrough the thronged streets of the canvas village; the membrane of\r\nhis soul flapped tumultuously in the noise and laughter. In a roped-off\r\nspace beyond, Mary was directing the children\xe2\x80\x99s sports. Little creatures\r\nseethed round about her, making a shrill, tinny clamour; others\r\nclustered about the skirts and trousers of their parents. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nwas shining in the heat; with an immense output of energy she started a\r\nthree-legged race. Denis looked on in admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, coming up behind her and touching her on\r\nthe arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen such energy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned towards him a face, round, red, and honest as the setting\r\nsun; the golden bell of her hair swung silently as she moved her head\r\nand quivered to rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Denis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low, serious voice, gasping a\r\nlittle as she spoke--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman here who has had\r\nthree children in thirty-one months?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, making rapid mental calculations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s appalling. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling her about the Malthusian League. One\r\nreally ought...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a sudden violent renewal of the metallic yelling announced the fact\r\nthat somebody had won the race. Mary became once more the centre of a\r\ndangerous vortex. It was time, Denis thought, to move on; he might be\r\nasked to do something if he stayed too long.\r\n\r\nHe turned back towards the canvas village. The thought of tea was\r\nmaking itself insistent in his mind. Tea, tea, tea. But the tea-tent was\r\nhorribly thronged. Anne, with an unusual expression of grimness on her\r\nflushed face, was furiously working the handle of the urn; the brown\r\nliquid spurted incessantly into the proffered cups. Portentous, in\r\nthe farther corner of the tent, Priscilla, in her royal toque, was\r\nencouraging the villagers. In a momentary lull Denis could hear her\r\ndeep, jovial laughter and her manly voice. Clearly, he told himself,\r\nthis was no place for one who wanted tea. He stood irresolute at the\r\nentrance to the tent. A beautiful thought suddenly came to him; if he\r\nwent back to the house, went unobtrusively, without being observed, if\r\nhe tiptoed into the dining-room and noiselessly opened the little doors\r\nof the sideboard--ah, then! In the cool recess within he would find\r\nbottles and a siphon; a bottle of crystal gin and a quart of soda water,\r\nand then for the cups that inebriate as well as cheer...\r\n\r\nA minute later he was walking briskly up the shady yew-tree walk. Within\r\nthe house it was deliciously quiet and cool. Carrying his well-filled\r\ntumbler with care, he went into the library. There, the glass on the\r\ncorner of the table beside him, he settled into a chair with a volume of\r\nSainte-Beuve. There was nothing, he found, like a Causerie du Lundi for\r\nsettling and soothing the troubled spirits. That tenuous membrane of his\r\nhad been too rudely buffeted by the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s emotions; it required a\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTowards sunset the fair itself became quiescent. It was the hour for the\r\ndancing to begin. At one side of the village of tents a space had been\r\nroped off. Acetylene lamps, hung round it on posts, cast a piercing\r\nwhite light. In one corner sat the band, and, obedient to its scraping\r\nand blowing, two or three hundred dancers trampled across the dry\r\nground, wearing away the grass with their booted feet. Round this patch\r\nof all but daylight, alive with motion and noise, the night seemed\r\npreternaturally dark. Bars of light reached out into it, and every now\r\nand then a lonely figure or a couple of lovers, interlaced, would cross\r\nthe bright shaft, flashing for a moment into visible existence, to\r\ndisappear again as quickly and surprisingly as they had come.\r\n\r\nDenis stood by the entrance of the enclosure, watching the swaying,\r\nshuffling crowd. The slow vortex brought the couples round and round\r\nagain before him, as though he were passing them in review. There\r\nwas Priscilla, still wearing her queenly toque, still encouraging the\r\nvillagers--this time by dancing with one of the tenant farmers. There\r\nwas Lord Moleyn, who had stayed on to the disorganised, passoverish\r\nmeal that took the place of dinner on this festal day; he one-stepped\r\nshamblingly, his bent knees more precariously wobbly than ever, with a\r\nterrified village beauty. Mr. Scogan trotted round with another. Mary\r\nwas in the embrace of a young farmer of heroic proportions; she was\r\nlooking up at him, talking, as Denis could see, very seriously. What\r\nabout? he wondered. The Malthusian League, perhaps. Seated in the corner\r\namong the band, Jenny was performing wonders of virtuosity upon the\r\ndrums. Her eyes shone, she smiled to herself. A whole subterranean life\r\nseemed to be expressing itself in those loud rat-tats, those long rolls\r\nand flourishes of drumming. Looking at her, Denis ruefully remembered\r\nthe red notebook; he wondered what sort of a figure he was cutting now.\r\nBut the sight of Anne and Gombauld swimming past--Anne with her eyes\r\nalmost shut and sleeping, as it were, on the sustaining wings of\r\nmovement and music--dissipated these preoccupations. Male and female\r\ncreated He them...There they were, Anne and Gombauld, and a hundred\r\ncouples more--all stepping harmoniously together to the old tune of Male\r\nand Female created He them. But Denis sat apart; he alone lacked his\r\ncomplementary opposite. They were all coupled but he; all but he...\r\n\r\nSomebody touched him on the shoulder and he looked up. It was Henry\r\nWimbush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never showed you our oaken drainpipes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the ones\r\nwe dug up are lying quite close to here. Would you like to come and see\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis got up, and they walked off together into the darkness. The music\r\ngrew fainter behind them. Some of the higher notes faded out altogether.\r\nJenny\xe2\x80\x99s drumming and the steady sawing of the bass throbbed on, tuneless\r\nand meaningless in their ears. Henry Wimbush halted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and, taking an electric torch out of his pocket,\r\nhe cast a dim beam over two or three blackened sections of tree trunk,\r\nscooped out into the semblance of pipes, which were lying forlornly in a\r\nlittle depression in the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, with a rather tepid enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThey sat down on the grass. A faint white glare, rising from behind a\r\nbelt of trees, indicated the position of the dancing-floor. The music\r\nwas nothing but a muffled rhythmic pulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Wimbush, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen this function comes at last\r\nto an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know how it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wimbush continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the spectacle\r\nof numbers of my fellow-creatures in a state of agitation moves in me\r\na certain weariness, rather than any gaiety or excitement. The fact is,\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t very much interest me. They\xe2\x80\x99re aren\xe2\x80\x99t in my line. You follow\r\nme? I could never take much interest, for example, in a collection of\r\npostage stamps. Primitives or seventeenth-century books--yes. They are\r\nmy line. But stamps, no. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about them; they\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nmy line. They don\xe2\x80\x99t interest me, they give me no emotion. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\nthe same with people, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. I\xe2\x80\x99m more at home with these pipes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He jerked his head sideways towards the hollowed logs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble with\r\nthe people and events of the present is that you never know anything\r\nabout them. What do I know of contemporary politics? Nothing. What do I\r\nknow of the people I see round about me? Nothing. What they think of\r\nme or of anything else in the world, what they will do in five minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime, are things I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess at. For all I know, you may suddenly jump\r\nup and try to murder me in a moment\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wimbush continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe little I know about your past is\r\ncertainly reassuring. But I know nothing of your present, and neither\r\nyou nor I know anything of your future. It\xe2\x80\x99s appalling; in living\r\npeople, one is dealing with unknown and unknowable quantities. One can\r\nonly hope to find out anything about them by a long series of the most\r\ndisagreeable and boring human contacts, involving a terrible expense\r\nof time. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same with current events; how can I find out anything\r\nabout them except by devoting years to the most exhausting first-hand\r\nstudy, involving once more an endless number of the most unpleasant\r\ncontacts? No, give me the past. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change; it\xe2\x80\x99s all there\r\nin black and white, and you can get to know about it comfortably and\r\ndecorously and, above all, privately--by reading. By reading I know a\r\ngreat deal of Caesar Borgia, of St. Francis, of Dr. Johnson; a few weeks\r\nhave made me thoroughly acquainted with these interesting characters,\r\nand I have been spared the tedious and revolting process of getting to\r\nknow them by personal contact, which I should have to do if they were\r\nliving now. How gay and delightful life would be if one could get rid\r\nof all the human contacts! Perhaps, in the future, when machines have\r\nattained to a state of perfection--for I confess that I am, like\r\nGodwin and Shelley, a believer in perfectibility, the perfectibility\r\nof machinery--then, perhaps, it will be possible for those who, like\r\nmyself, desire it, to live in a dignified seclusion, surrounded by the\r\ndelicate attentions of silent and graceful machines, and entirely secure\r\nfrom any human intrusion. It is a beautiful thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what about the desirable human contacts,\r\nlike love and friendship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe black silhouette against the darkness shook its head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pleasures\r\neven of these contacts are much exaggerated,\xe2\x80\x9d said the polite level\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me doubtful whether they are equal to the pleasures\r\nof private reading and contemplation. Human contacts have been so highly\r\nvalued in the past only because reading was not a common accomplishment\r\nand because books were scarce and difficult to reproduce. The world, you\r\nmust remember, is only just becoming literate. As reading becomes more\r\nand more habitual and widespread, an ever-increasing number of people\r\nwill discover that books will give them all the pleasures of social\r\nlife and none of its intolerable tedium. At present people in search\r\nof pleasure naturally tend to congregate in large herds and to make a\r\nnoise; in future their natural tendency will be to seek solitude and\r\nquiet. The proper study of mankind is books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think that it may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis; he was wondering if Anne\r\nand Gombauld were still dancing together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wimbush, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI must go and see if\r\nall is well on the dancing-floor.\xe2\x80\x9d They got up and began to walk slowly\r\ntowards the white glare. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all these people were dead,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Wimbush\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cthis festivity would be extremely agreeable. Nothing would be\r\npleasanter than to read in a well-written book of an open-air ball that\r\ntook place a century ago. How charming! one would say; how pretty\r\nand how amusing! But when the ball takes place to-day, when one finds\r\noneself involved in it, then one sees the thing in its true light. It\r\nturns out to be merely this.\xe2\x80\x9d He waved his hand in the direction of\r\nthe acetylene flares. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my youth,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfound myself, quite fortuitously, involved in a series of the most\r\nphantasmagorical amorous intrigues. A novelist could have made his\r\nfortune out of them, and even if I were to tell you, in my bald style,\r\nthe details of these adventures, you would be amazed at the romantic\r\ntale. But I assure you, while they were happening--these romantic\r\nadventures--they seemed to me no more and no less exciting than any\r\nother incident of actual life. To climb by night up a rope-ladder to a\r\nsecond-floor window in an old house in Toledo seemed to me, while I was\r\nactually performing this rather dangerous feat, an action as obvious, as\r\nmuch to be taken for granted, as--how shall I put it?--as quotidian as\r\ncatching the 8.52 from Surbiton to go to business on a Monday morning.\r\nAdventures and romance only take on their adventurous and romantic\r\nqualities at second-hand. Live them, and they are just a slice of life\r\nlike the rest. In literature they become as charming as this dismal ball\r\nwould be if we were celebrating its tercentenary.\xe2\x80\x9d They had come to\r\nthe entrance of the enclosure and stood there, blinking in the dazzling\r\nlight. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, if only we were!\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Wimbush added.\r\n\r\nAnne and Gombauld were still dancing together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nIt was after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The dancers had already dispersed and the\r\nlast lights were being put out. To-morrow the tents would be struck, the\r\ndismantled merry-go-round would be packed into waggons and carted away.\r\nAn expanse of worn grass, a shabby brown patch in the wide green of the\r\npark, would be all that remained. Crome Fair was over.\r\n\r\nBy the edge of the pool two figures lingered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne was saying in a breathless whisper, leaning\r\nbackwards, turning her head from side to side in an effort to escape\r\nGombauld\xe2\x80\x99s kisses. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, please. No.\xe2\x80\x9d Her raised voice had become\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nGombauld relaxed his embrace a little. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a sudden effort Anne freed herself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to take the most unfair advantage of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfair advantage?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Gombauld in genuine surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, unfair advantage. You attack me after I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dancing for two\r\nhours, while I\xe2\x80\x99m still reeling drunk with the movement, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost\r\nmy head, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no mind left but only a rhythmical body! It\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nbad as making love to someone you\xe2\x80\x99ve drugged or intoxicated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGombauld laughed angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cCall me a White Slaver and have done with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cI am now completely sobered, and if you try and\r\nkiss me again I shall box your ears. Shall we take a few turns round the\r\npool?\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night is delicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor answer Gombauld made an irritated noise. They paced off slowly, side\r\nby side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I like about the painting of Degas...\xe2\x80\x9d Anne began in her most\r\ndetached and conversational tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, damn Degas!\xe2\x80\x9d Gombauld was almost shouting.\r\n\r\nFrom where he stood, leaning in an attitude of despair against the\r\nparapet of the terrace, Denis had seen them, the two pale figures in\r\na patch of moonlight, far down by the pool\xe2\x80\x99s edge. He had seen the\r\nbeginning of what promised to be an endless passionate embracement,\r\nand at the sight he had fled. It was too much; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. In\r\nanother moment, he felt, he would have burst into irrepressible tears.\r\n\r\nDashing blindly into the house, he almost ran into Mr. Scogan, who was\r\nwalking up and down the hall smoking a final pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, catching him by the arm; dazed and hardly\r\nconscious of what he was doing or where he was, Denis stood there for\r\na moment like a somnambulist. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou look disturbed, distressed, depressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis shook his head without replying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorried about the cosmos, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Scogan patted him on the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow the feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a most distressing symptom. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe point of it all? All is vanity. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of continuing to\r\nfunction if one\xe2\x80\x99s doomed to be snuffed out at last along with everything\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, yes. I know exactly how you feel. It\xe2\x80\x99s most distressing if\r\none allows oneself to be distressed. But then why allow oneself to be\r\ndistressed? After all, we all know that there\xe2\x80\x99s no ultimate point. But\r\nwhat difference does that make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point the somnambulist suddenly woke up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nblinking and frowning at his interlocutor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Then breaking away he\r\ndashed up the stairs, two steps at a time.\r\n\r\nMr. Scogan ran to the foot of the stairs and called up after him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmakes no difference, none whatever. Life is gay all the same, always,\r\nunder whatever circumstances--under whatever circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nraising his voice to a shout. But Denis was already far out of hearing,\r\nand even if he had not been, his mind to-night was proof against all\r\nthe consolations of philosophy. Mr. Scogan replaced his pipe between his\r\nteeth and resumed his meditative pacing. \xe2\x80\x9cUnder any circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated to himself. It was ungrammatical to begin with; was it true?\r\nAnd is life really its own reward? He wondered. When his pipe had burned\r\nitself to its stinking conclusion he took a drink of gin and went to\r\nbed. In ten minutes he was deeply, innocently asleep.\r\n\r\nDenis had mechanically undressed and, clad in those flowered silk\r\npyjamas of which he was so justly proud, was lying face downwards on\r\nhis bed. Time passed. When at last he looked up, the candle which he\r\nhad left alight at his bedside had burned down almost to the socket. He\r\nlooked at his watch; it was nearly half-past one. His head ached, his\r\ndry, sleepless eyes felt as though they had been bruised from behind,\r\nand the blood was beating within his ears a loud arterial drum. He got\r\nup, opened the door, tiptoed noiselessly along the passage, and began\r\nto mount the stairs towards the higher floors. Arrived at the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nquarters under the roof, he hesitated, then turning to the right he\r\nopened a little door at the end of the corridor. Within was a pitch-dark\r\ncupboard-like boxroom, hot, stuffy, and smelling of dust and old\r\nleather. He advanced cautiously into the blackness, groping with his\r\nhands. It was from this den that the ladder went up to the leads of\r\nthe western tower. He found the ladder, and set his feet on the rungs;\r\nnoiselessly, he lifted the trap-door above his head; the moonlit sky was\r\nover him, he breathed the fresh, cool air of the night. In a moment\r\nhe was standing on the leads, gazing out over the dim, colourless\r\nlandscape, looking perpendicularly down at the terrace seventy feet\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nWhy had he climbed up to this high, desolate place? Was it to look at\r\nthe moon? Was it to commit suicide? As yet he hardly knew. Death--the\r\ntears came into his eyes when he thought of it. His misery assumed\r\na certain solemnity; he was lifted up on the wings of a kind of\r\nexaltation. It was a mood in which he might have done almost anything,\r\nhowever foolish. He advanced towards the farther parapet; the drop was\r\nsheer there and uninterrupted. A good leap, and perhaps one might clear\r\nthe narrow terrace and so crash down yet another thirty feet to the\r\nsun-baked ground below. He paused at the corner of the tower, looking\r\nnow down into the shadowy gulf below, now up towards the rare stars and\r\nthe waning moon. He made a gesture with his hand, muttered something,\r\nhe could not afterwards remember what; but the fact that he had said\r\nit aloud gave the utterance a peculiarly terrible significance. Then he\r\nlooked down once more into the depths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ARE you doing, Denis?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned a voice from somewhere very\r\nclose behind him.\r\n\r\nDenis uttered a cry of frightened surprise, and very nearly went over\r\nthe parapet in good earnest. His heart was beating terribly, and he was\r\npale when, recovering himself, he turned round in the direction from\r\nwhich the voice had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the profound shadow that slept under the eastern parapet of the\r\ntower, he saw something he had not previously noticed--an oblong\r\nshape. It was a mattress, and someone was lying on it. Since that first\r\nmemorable night on the tower, Mary had slept out every evening; it was a\r\nsort of manifestation of fidelity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gave me a fright,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto wake up and see you waving your\r\narms and gibbering there. What on earth were you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis laughed melodramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. If she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwoken up as she did, he would be lying in pieces at the bottom of the\r\ntower; he was certain of that, now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got designs on me, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary inquired, jumping too\r\nrapidly to conclusions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Denis, laughing more bitterly and\r\nartificially than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat IS the matter, Denis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the edge of the mattress, and for all reply went on\r\nlaughing in the same frightful and improbable tone.\r\n\r\nAn hour later he was reposing with his head on Mary\xe2\x80\x99s knees, and she,\r\nwith an affectionate solicitude that was wholly maternal, was running\r\nher fingers through his tangled hair. He had told her everything,\r\neverything: his hopeless love, his jealousy, his despair, his\r\nsuicide--as it were providentially averted by her interposition. He had\r\nsolemnly promised never to think of self-destruction again. And now his\r\nsoul was floating in a sad serenity. It was embalmed in the sympathy\r\nthat Mary so generously poured. And it was not only in receiving\r\nsympathy that Denis found serenity and even a kind of happiness; it\r\nwas also in giving it. For if he had told Mary everything about his\r\nmiseries, Mary, reacting to these confidences, had told him in return\r\neverything, or very nearly everything, about her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d He was very sorry for her. Still, she might have guessed\r\nthat Ivor wasn\xe2\x80\x99t precisely a monument of constancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cone must put a good face on it.\xe2\x80\x9d She wanted to\r\ncry, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow herself to be weak. There was a silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Denis hesitatingly--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you really think that\r\nshe...that Gombauld...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary answered decisively. There was another long\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, utterly dejected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better go away,\xe2\x80\x9d advised Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the safest thing, and the\r\nmost sensible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged to stay here three weeks more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must concoct an excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, who was recovering all her firm\r\nself-possession. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this, can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed.\r\n\r\nImmensely practical, Mary invented a plan of action. Startlingly, in the\r\ndarkness, the church clock struck three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to bed at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d no idea it was so late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis clambered down the ladder, cautiously descended the creaking\r\nstairs. His room was dark; the candle had long ago guttered to\r\nextinction. He got into bed and fell asleep almost at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nDenis had been called, but in spite of the parted curtains he had\r\ndropped off again into that drowsy, dozy state when sleep becomes a\r\nsensual pleasure almost consciously savoured. In this condition he might\r\nhave remained for another hour if he had not been disturbed by a violent\r\nrapping at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled, without opening his eyes. The latch clicked, a\r\nhand seized him by the shoulder and he was rudely shaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyelids blinked painfully apart, and he saw Mary standing over him,\r\nbright-faced and earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must go and send the telegram. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d He threw off the bed-clothes; his tormentor retired.\r\n\r\nDenis dressed as quickly as he could and ran up the road to the village\r\npost office. Satisfaction glowed within him as he returned. He had sent\r\na long telegram, which would in a few hours evoke an answer ordering\r\nhim back to town at once--on urgent business. It was an act performed,\r\na decisive step taken--and he so rarely took decisive steps; he felt\r\npleased with himself. It was with a whetted appetite that he came in to\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99re better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were rather worried about the cosmos last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis tried to laugh away the impeachment. \xe2\x80\x9cWas I?\xe2\x80\x9d he lightly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had nothing worse to prey on my mind.\r\nI should be a happy man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is only happy in action,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis enunciated, thinking of the\r\ntelegram.\r\n\r\nHe looked out of the window. Great florid baroque clouds floated high\r\nin the blue heaven. A wind stirred among the trees, and their shaken\r\nfoliage twinkled and glittered like metal in the sun. Everything seemed\r\nmarvellously beautiful. At the thought that he would soon be leaving\r\nall this beauty he felt a momentary pang; but he comforted himself by\r\nrecollecting how decisively he was acting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAction,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated aloud, and going over to the sideboard he helped\r\nhimself to an agreeable mixture of bacon and fish.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, Denis repaired to the terrace, and, sitting there,\r\nraised the enormous bulwark of the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes\xe2\x80\x9d against the possible assaults\r\nof Mr. Scogan, who showed an unappeased desire to go on talking about\r\nthe Universe. Secure behind the crackling pages, he meditated. In\r\nthe light of this brilliant morning the emotions of last night seemed\r\nsomehow rather remote. And what if he had seen them embracing in the\r\nmoonlight? Perhaps it didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean much after all. And even if it did,\r\nwhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he stay? He felt strong enough to stay, strong enough to\r\nbe aloof, disinterested, a mere friendly acquaintance. And even if he\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t strong enough...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time do you think the telegram will arrive?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary suddenly,\r\nthrusting in upon him over the top of the paper.\r\n\r\nDenis started guiltily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only wondering,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause there\xe2\x80\x99s a very good train at\r\n3.27, and it would be nice if you could catch it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully nice,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed weakly. He felt as though he were making\r\narrangements for his own funeral. Train leaves Waterloo 3.27. No\r\nflowers...Mary was gone. No, he was blowed if he\xe2\x80\x99d let himself be\r\nhurried down to the Necropolis like this. He was blowed. The sight of\r\nMr. Scogan looking out, with a hungry expression, from the drawing-room\r\nwindow made him precipitately hoist the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes\xe2\x80\x9d once more. For a long\r\nwhile he kept it hoisted. Lowering it at last to take another cautious\r\npeep at his surroundings, he found himself, with what astonishment!\r\nconfronted by Anne\xe2\x80\x99s faint, amused, malicious smile. She was standing\r\nbefore him,--the woman who was a tree,--the swaying grace of her\r\nmovement arrested in a pose that seemed itself a movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been standing there?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when he had done\r\ngaping at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, about half an hour, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she said airily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were so very\r\ndeep in your paper--head over ears--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to disturb you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look lovely this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis exclaimed. It was the first time\r\nhe had ever had the courage to utter a personal remark of the kind.\r\n\r\nAnne held up her hand as though to ward off a blow. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bludgeon me,\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat down on the bench beside him. He was a nice boy, she\r\nthought, quite charming; and Gombauld\xe2\x80\x99s violent insistences were really\r\nbecoming rather tiresome. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you wear white trousers?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cI like you so much in white trousers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re at the wash,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis replied rather curtly. This white-trouser\r\nbusiness was all in the wrong spirit. He was just preparing a scheme\r\nto manoeuvre the conversation back to the proper path, when Mr. Scogan\r\nsuddenly darted out of the house, crossed the terrace with clockwork\r\nrapidity, and came to a halt in front of the bench on which they were\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go on with our interesting conversation about the cosmos,\xe2\x80\x9d he began,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI become more and more convinced that the various parts of the concern\r\nare fundamentally discrete...But would you mind, Denis, moving a shade\r\nto your right?\xe2\x80\x9d He wedged himself between them on the bench. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if\r\nyou would shift a few inches to the left, my dear Anne...Thank you.\r\nDiscrete, I think, was what I was saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. Denis was speechless.\r\n\r\nThey were taking their after luncheon coffee in the library when the\r\ntelegram arrived. Denis blushed guiltily as he took the orange envelope\r\nfrom the salver and tore it open. \xe2\x80\x9cReturn at once. Urgent family\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d It was too ridiculous. As if he had any family business!\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be best just to crumple the thing up and put it in his\r\npocket without saying anything about it? He looked up; Mary\xe2\x80\x99s large blue\r\nchina eyes were fixed upon him, seriously, penetratingly. He blushed\r\nmore deeply than ever, hesitated in a horrible uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your telegram about?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked significantly.\r\n\r\nHe lost his head, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid this means\r\nI shall have to go back to town at once.\xe2\x80\x9d He frowned at the telegram\r\nferociously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s absurd, impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne. She had been standing by\r\nthe window talking to Gombauld; but at Denis\xe2\x80\x99s words she came swaying\r\nacross the room towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s urgent,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated desperately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve only been here such a short time,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, utterly miserable. Oh, if only she could understand!\r\nWomen were supposed to have intuition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he must go, he must,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Mary firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I must.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the telegram again for inspiration. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee, it\xe2\x80\x99s urgent family business,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\r\n\r\nPriscilla got up from her chair in some excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a distinct\r\npresentiment of this last night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cA distinct presentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mere coincidence, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, brushing Mrs. Wimbush out of\r\nthe conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a very good train at 3.27.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at the\r\nclock on the mantelpiece. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have nice time to pack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll order the motor at once.\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Wimbush rang the bell. The funeral\r\nwas well under way. It was awful, awful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am wretched you should be going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\nDenis turned towards her; she really did look wretched. He abandoned\r\nhimself hopelessly, fatalistically to his destiny. This was what came of\r\naction, of doing something decisive. If only he\xe2\x80\x99d just let things drift!\r\nIf only...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall miss your conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Scogan.\r\n\r\nMary looked at the clock again. \xe2\x80\x9cI think perhaps you ought to go and\r\npack,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nObediently Denis left the room. Never again, he said to himself, never\r\nagain would he do anything decisive. Camlet, West Bowlby, Knipswich for\r\nTimpany, Spavin Delawarr; and then all the other stations; and then,\r\nfinally, London. The thought of the journey appalled him. And what on\r\nearth was he going to do in London when he got there? He climbed wearily\r\nup the stairs. It was time for him to lay himself in his coffin.\r\n\r\nThe car was at the door--the hearse. The whole party had assembled to\r\nsee him go. Good-bye, good-bye. Mechanically he tapped the barometer\r\nthat hung in the porch; the needle stirred perceptibly to the left. A\r\nsudden smile lighted up his lugubrious face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It sinks and I am ready to depart,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quoting Landor with an\r\nexquisite aptness. He looked quickly round from face to face. Nobody had\r\nnoticed. He climbed into the hearse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Crome Yellow, by Aldous Huxley\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CROME YELLOW ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1999-0.txt or 1999-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/9/1999/\r\n\r\nProduced by Sue Asscher\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
