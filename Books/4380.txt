This roofed-in gallery of rustic wood-work on the first\r\nfloor of the palatial hospital is isolated in Space and overlooks the\r\nworld. The blankets of fine wool--red, green, brown, or white--from\r\nwhich those wasted cheeks and shining eyes protrude are quite still. No\r\nsound comes from the long couches except when some one coughs, or that\r\nof the pages of a book turned over at long and regular intervals, or\r\nthe undertone of question and quiet answer between neighbors, or now\r\nand again the crescendo disturbance of a daring crow, escaped to the\r\nbalcony from those flocks that seem threaded across the immense\r\ntransparency like chaplets of black pearls.\r\n\r\nSilence is obligatory. Besides, the rich and high-placed who have come\r\nhere from all the ends of the earth, smitten by the same evil, have\r\nlost the habit of talking. They have withdrawn into themselves, to\r\nthink of their life and of their death.\r\n\r\nA servant appears in the balcony, dressed in white and walking softly.\r\nShe brings newspapers and hands them about.\r\n\r\n"It\'s decided," says the first to unfold his paper. "War is declared."\r\n\r\nExpected as the news is, its effect is almost dazing, for this audience\r\nfeels that its portent is without measure or limit. These men of\r\nculture and intelligence, detached from the affairs of the world and\r\nalmost from the world itself, whose faculties are deepened by suffering\r\nand meditation, as far remote from their fellow men as if they were\r\nalready of the Future--these men look deeply into the distance, towards\r\nthe unknowable land of the living and the insane.\r\n\r\n"Austria\'s act is a crime," says the Austrian.\r\n\r\n"France must win," says the Englishman.\r\n\r\n"I hope Germany will be beaten," says the German.\r\n\r\nThey settle down again under the blankets and on the pillows, looking\r\nto heaven and the high peaks. But in spite of that vast purity, the\r\nsilence is filled with the dire disclosure of a moment before.\r\n\r\nWar!\r\n\r\nSome of the invalids break the silence, and say the word again under\r\ntheir breath, reflecting that this is the greatest happening of the\r\nage, and perhaps of all ages. Even on the lucid landscape at which they\r\ngaze the news casts something like a vague and somber mirage.\r\n\r\nThe tranquil expanses of the valley, adorned with soft and smooth\r\npastures and hamlets rosy as the rose, with the sable shadow-stains of\r\nthe majestic mountains and the black lace and white of pines and\r\neternal snow, become alive with the movements of men, whose multitudes\r\nswarm in distinct masses. Attacks develop, wave by wave, across the\r\nfields and then stand still. Houses are eviscerated like human beings\r\nand towns like houses. Villages appear in crumpled whiteness as though\r\nfallen from heaven to earth. The very shape of the plain is changed by\r\nthe frightful heaps of wounded and slain.\r\n\r\nEach country whose frontiers are consumed by carnage is seen tearing\r\nfrom its heart ever more warriors of full blood and force. One\'s eyes\r\nfollow the flow of these living tributaries to the River of Death. To\r\nnorth and south and west afar there are battles on every side. Turn\r\nwhere you will, there is war in every corner of that vastness.\r\n\r\nOne of the pale-faced clairvoyants lifts himself on his elbow, reckons\r\nand numbers the fighters present and to come--thirty millions of\r\nsoldiers. Another stammers, his eyes full of slaughter, "Two armies at\r\ndeath-grips--that is one great army committing suicide."\r\n\r\n"It should not have been," says the deep and hollow voice of the first\r\nin the line. But another says, "It is the French Revolution beginning\r\nagain." "Let thrones beware!" says another\'s undertone.\r\n\r\nThe third adds, "Perhaps it is the last war of all." A silence follows,\r\nthen some heads are shaken in dissent whose faces have been blanched\r\nanew by the stale tragedy of sleepless night--"Stop war? Stop war?\r\nImpossible! There is no cure for the world\'s disease."\r\n\r\nSome one coughs, and then the Vision is swallowed up in the huge sunlit\r\npeace of the lush meadows. In the rich colors of the glowing kine, the\r\nblack forests, the green fields and the blue distance, dies the\r\nreflection of the fire where the old world burns and breaks. Infinite\r\nsilence engulfs the uproar of hate and pain from the dark swarmings of\r\nmankind. They who have spoken retire one by one within themselves,\r\nabsorbed once more in their own mysterious malady.\r\n\r\nBut when evening is ready to descend within the valley, a storm breaks\r\nover the mass of Mont Blanc. One may not go forth in such peril, for\r\nthe last waves of the storm-wind roll even to the great veranda, to\r\nthat harbor where they have taken refuge; and these victims of a great\r\ninternal wound encompass with their gaze the elemental convulsion.\r\n\r\nThey watch how the explosions of thunder on the mountain upheave the\r\nlevel clouds like a stormy sea, how each one hurls a shaft of fire and\r\na column of cloud together into the twilight; and they turn their wan\r\nand sunken faces to follow the flight of the eagles that wheel in the\r\nsky and look from their supreme height down through the wreathing\r\nmists, down to earth.\r\n\r\n"Put an end to war?" say the watchers.--"Forbid the Storm!"\r\n\r\nCleansed from the passions of party and faction, liberated from\r\nprejudice and infatuation and the tyranny of tradition, these watchers\r\non the threshold of another world are vaguely conscious of the\r\nsimplicity of the present and the yawning possibilities of the future.\r\n\r\nThe man at the end of the rank cries, "I can see crawling things down\r\nthere"--"Yes, as though they were alive"--"Some sort of plant,\r\nperhaps"--"Some kind of men"--\r\n\r\nAnd there amid the baleful glimmers of the storm, below the dark\r\ndisorder of the clouds that extend and unfurl over the earth like evil\r\nspirits, they seem to see a great livid plain unrolled, which to their\r\nseeing is made of mud and water, while figures appear and fast fix\r\nthemselves to the surface of it, all blinded and borne down with filth,\r\nlike the dreadful castaways of shipwreck. And it seems to them that\r\nthese are soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe streaming plain, seamed and seared with long parallel canals and\r\nscooped into water-holes, is an immensity, and these castaways who\r\nstrive to exhume themselves from it are legion. But the thirty million\r\nslaves, hurled upon one another in the mud of war by guilt and error,\r\nuplift their human faces and reveal at last a bourgeoning Will. The\r\nfuture is in the hands of these slaves, and it is clearly certain that\r\nthe alliance to be cemented some day by those whose number and whose\r\nmisery alike are infinite will transform the old world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the Earth\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE great pale sky is alive with thunderclaps. Each detonation reveals\r\ntogether a shaft of red falling fire in what is left of the night, and\r\na column of smoke in what has dawned of the day. Up there--so high and\r\nso far that they are heard unseen--a flight of dreadful birds goes\r\ncircling up with strong and palpitating cries to look down upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe earth! It is a vast and water-logged desert that begins to take\r\nshape under the long-drawn desolation of daybreak. There are pools and\r\ngullies where the bitter breath of earliest morning nips the water and\r\nsets it a-shiver; tracks traced by the troops and the convoys of the\r\nnight in these barren fields, the lines of ruts that glisten in the\r\nweak light like steel rails, mud-masses with broken stakes protruding\r\nfrom them, ruined trestles, and bushes of wire in tangled coils. With\r\nits slime-beds and puddles, the plain might be an endless gray sheet\r\nthat floats on the sea and has here and there gone under. Though no\r\nrain is falling, all is drenched, oozing, washed out and drowned, and\r\neven the wan light seems to flow.\r\n\r\nNow you can make out a network of long ditches where the lave of the\r\nnight still lingers. It is the trench. It is carpeted at bottom with a\r\nlayer of slime that liberates the foot at each step with a sticky\r\nsound; and by each dug-out it smells of the night\'s excretions. The\r\nholes themselves, as you stoop to peer in, are foul of breath.\r\n\r\nI see shadows coming from these sidelong pits and moving about, huge\r\nand misshapen lumps, bear-like, that flounder and growl. They are "us."\r\nWe are muffled like Eskimos. Fleeces and blankets and sacking wrap us\r\nup, weigh us down, magnify us strangely. Some stretch themselves,\r\nyawning profoundly. Faces appear, ruddy or leaden, dirt-disfigured,\r\npierced by the little lamps of dull and heavy-lidded eyes, matted with\r\nuncut beards and foul with forgotten hair.\r\n\r\nCrack! Crack! Boom!--rifle fire and cannonade. Above us and all around,\r\nit crackles and rolls, in long gusts or separate explosions. The\r\nflaming and melancholy storm never, never ends. For more than fifteen\r\nmonths, for five hundred days in this part of the world where we are,\r\nthe rifles and the big guns have gone on from morning to night and from\r\nnight to morning. We are buried deep in an everlasting battlefield; but\r\nlike the ticking of the clocks at home in the days gone by--in the now\r\nalmost legendary Past--you only hear the noise when you listen.\r\n\r\nA babyish face with puffy eyelids, and cheek-bones as lurid as if\r\nlozenge-shaped bits of crimson paper had been stuck on, comes out of\r\nthe ground, opens one eye, then the other. It is Paradis. The skin of\r\nhis fat cheeks is scored with the marks of the folds in the tent-cloth\r\nthat has served him for night-cap. The glance of his little eye wanders\r\nall round me; he sees me, nods, and says--"Another night gone, old\r\nchap."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sonny; how many more like it still?"\r\n\r\nHe raises his two plump arms skywards. He has managed to scrape out by\r\nthe steps of the dug-out and is beside me. After stumbling over the dim\r\nobstacle of a man who sits in the shadows, fervently scratches himself\r\nand sighs hoarsely, Paradis makes off--lamely splashing like a penguin\r\nthrough the flooded picture.\r\n\r\nOne by one the men appear from the depths. In the corners, heavy\r\nshadows are seen forming--human clouds that move and break up. One by\r\none they become recognizable. There is one who comes out hooded with\r\nhis blanket--a savage, you would say, or rather, the tent of a savage,\r\nwhich walks and sways from side to side. Near by, and heavily framed in\r\nknitted wool, a square face is disclosed, yellow-brown as though\r\niodized, and patterned with blackish patches, the nose broken, the eyes\r\nof Chinese restriction and red-circled, a little coarse and moist\r\nmustache like a greasing-brush.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Volpatte. How goes it, Firmin?"\r\n\r\n"It goes, it goes, and it comes," says Volpatte. His heavy and drawling\r\nvoice is aggravated by hoarseness. He coughs--"My number\'s up, this\r\ntime. Say, did you hear it last night, the attack? My boy, talk about a\r\nbombardment--something very choice in the way of mixtures!" He sniffles\r\nand passes his sleeve under his concave nose. His hand gropes within\r\nhis greatcoat and his jacket till it finds the skin, and scratches.\r\n"I\'ve killed thirty of them in the candle," he growls; "in the big\r\ndug-out by the tunnel, mon vieux, there are some like crumbs of metal\r\nbread. You can see them running about in the straw like I\'m telling\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s been attacking? The Boches?"\r\n\r\n"The Boches and us too--out Vimy way--a counterattack--didn\'t you hear\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"No," the big Lamuse, the ox-man, replies on my account; "I was\r\nsnoring; but I was on fatigue all night the night before."\r\n\r\n"I heard it," declares the little Breton, Biquet; "I slept badly, or\r\nrather, didn\'t sleep. I\'ve got a doss-house all to myself. Look, see,\r\nthere it is--the damned thing." He points to a trough on the ground\r\nlevel, where on a meager mattress of muck, there is just body-room for\r\none. "Talk about home in a nutshell!" he declares, wagging the rough\r\nand rock-hard little head that looks as if it had never been finished.\r\n"I hardly snoozed. I\'d just got off, but was woke up by the relief of\r\nthe 129th that went by--not by the noise, but the smell. Ah, all those\r\nchaps with their feet on the level with my nose! It woke me up, it gave\r\nme nose-ache so."\r\n\r\nI knew it. I have often been wakened in the trench myself by the trail\r\nof heavy smell in the wake of marching men.\r\n\r\n"It was all right, at least, if it killed the vermin," said Tirette.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, it excites them," says Lamuse; "the worse you smell,\r\nthe more you have of \'em."\r\n\r\n"And it\'s lucky," Biquet went on, "that their stink woke me up. As I\r\nwas telling that great tub just now, I got my peepers open just in time\r\nto seize the tent-cloth that shut my hole up--one of those muck-heaps\r\nwas going to pinch it off me."\r\n\r\n"Dirty devils, the 129th." The human form from which the words came\r\ncould now be distinguished down below at our feet, where the morning\r\nhad not yet reached it. Grasping his abundant clothing by handsful, he\r\nsquatted and wriggled. It was Papa Blaire. His little eyes blinked\r\namong the dust that luxuriated on his face. Above the gap of his\r\ntoothless mouth, his mustache made a heavy sallow lump. His hands were\r\nhorribly black, the top of them shaggy with dirt, the palms plastered\r\nin gray relief. Himself, shriveled and dirtbedight, exhaled the scent\r\nof an ancient stewpan. Though busily scratching, he chatted with big\r\nBarque, who leaned towards him from a little way off.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t as mucky as this when I was a civvy," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, my poor friend, it\'s a dirty change for the worse," said Barque.\r\n\r\n"Lucky for you," says Tirette, going one better; "when it comes to\r\nkids, you\'ll present madame with some little niggers!"\r\n\r\nBlaire took offense, and gathering gloom wrinkled his brow. "What have\r\nyou got to give me lip about, you? What next? It\'s war-time. As for\r\nyou, bean-face, you think perhaps the war hasn\'t changed your phizog\r\nand your manners? Look at yourself, monkey-snout, buttock-skin! A man\r\nmust be a beast to talk as you do." He passed his hand over the dark\r\ndeposit on his face, which the rains of those days had proved finally\r\nindelible, and added, "Besides, if I am as I am, it\'s my own choosing.\r\nTo begin with, I have no teeth. The major said to me a long time ago,\r\n\'You haven\'t a single tooth. It\'s not enough. At your next rest,\' he\r\nsays, \'take a turn round to the estomalogical ambulance.\'"\r\n\r\n"The tomatological ambulance," corrected Barque.\r\n\r\n"Stomatological," Bertrand amended.\r\n\r\n"You have all the making of an army cook--you ought to have been one,"\r\nsaid Barque.\r\n\r\n"My idea, too," retorted Blaire innocently. Some one laughed. The black\r\nman got up at the insult. "You give me belly-ache," he said with scorn.\r\n"I\'m off to the latrines."\r\n\r\nWhen his doubly dark silhouette had vanished, the others scrutinized\r\nonce more the great truth that down here in the earth the cooks are the\r\ndirtiest of men.\r\n\r\n"If you see a chap with his skin and toggery so smeared and stained\r\nthat you wouldn\'t touch him with a barge-pole, you can say to yourself,\r\n\'Probably he\'s a cook.\' And the dirtier he is, the more likely to be a\r\ncook."\r\n\r\n"It\'s true, and true again," said Marthereau.\r\n\r\n"Tiens, there\'s Tirloir! Hey, Tirloir!"\r\n\r\nHe comes up busily, peering this way and that, on an eager scent. His\r\ninsignificant head, pale as chlorine, hops centrally about in the\r\ncushioning collar of a greatcoat that is much too heavy and big for\r\nhim. His chin is pointed, and his upper teeth protrude. A wrinkle round\r\nhis mouth is so deep with dirt that it looks like a muzzle. As usual,\r\nhe is angry, and as usual, he rages aloud.\r\n\r\n"Some one cut my pouch in two last night!"\r\n\r\n"It was the relief of the 129th. Where had you put it?"\r\n\r\nHe indicates a bayonet stuck in the wall of the trench close to the\r\nmouth of a funk-hole--"There, hanging on the toothpick there."\r\n\r\n"Ass!" comes the chorus. "Within reach of passing soldiers! Not dotty,\r\nare you?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard lines all the same," wails Tirloir. Then suddenly a fit of\r\nrage seizes him, his face crumples, his little fists clench in fury, he\r\ntightens them like knots in string and waves them about. "Alors quoi?\r\nAh, if I had hold of the mongrel that did it! Talk about breaking his\r\njaw--I\'d stave in his bread-pan, I\'d--there was a whole Camembert in\r\nthere, I\'ll go and look for it." He massages his stomach with the\r\nlittle sharp taps of a guitar player, and plunges into the gray of the\r\nmorning, grinning yet dignified, with his awkward outlines of an\r\ninvalid in a dressing-gown. We hear him grumbling until he disappears.\r\n\r\n"Strange man, that," says Pepin; the others chuckle. "He\'s daft and\r\ncrazy," declares Marthereau, who is in the habit of fortifying the\r\nexpression of his thought by using two synonyms at once.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"Tiens, old man," says Tulacque, as he comes up. "Look at this."\r\n\r\nTulacque is magnificent. He is wearing a lemon-yellow coat made out of\r\nan oilskin sleeping-sack. He has arranged a hole in the middle to get\r\nhis head through, and compelled his shoulder-straps and belt to go over\r\nit. He is tall and bony. He holds his face in advance as he walks, a\r\nforceful face, with eyes that squint. He has something in his hand. "I\r\nfound this while digging last night at the end of the new gallery to\r\nchange the rotten gratings. It took my fancy off-hand, that\r\nknick-knack. It\'s an old pattern of hatchet."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed an old pattern, a sharpened flint hafted with an old\r\nbrown bone--quite a prehistoric tool in appearance.\r\n\r\n"Very handy," said Tulacque, fingering it. "Yes, not badly thought out.\r\nBetter balanced than the regulation ax. That\'ll be useful to me, you\'ll\r\nsee." As he brandishes that ax of Post-Tertiary Man, he would himself\r\npass for an ape-man, decked out with rags and lurking in the bowels of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nOne by one we gathered, we of Bertrand\'s squad and the half-section, at\r\nan elbow of the trench. Just here it is a little wider than in the\r\nstraight part where when you meet another and have to pass you must\r\nthrow yourself against the side, rub your back in the earth and your\r\nstomach against the stomach of the other.\r\n\r\nOur company occupies, in reserve, a second line parallel. No night\r\nwatchman works here. At night we are ready for making earthworks in\r\nfront, but as long as the day lasts we have nothing to do. Huddled up\r\ntogether and linked arm in arm, it only remains to await the evening as\r\nbest we can.\r\n\r\nDaylight has at last crept into the interminable crevices that furrow\r\nthis part of the earth, and now it finds the threshold of our holes. It\r\nis the melancholy light of the North Country, of a restricted and muddy\r\nsky, a sky which itself, one would say, is heavy with the smoke and\r\nsmell of factories. In this leaden light, the uncouth array of these\r\ndwellers in the depths reveals the stark reality of the huge and\r\nhopeless misery that brought it into being. But that is like the rattle\r\nof rifles and the verberation of artillery. The drama in which we are\r\nactors has lasted much too long for us to be surprised any more, either\r\nat the stubbornness we have evolved or the garb we have devised against\r\nthe rain that comes from above, against the mud that comes from\r\nbeneath, and against the cold--that sort of infinity that is\r\neverywhere. The skins of animals, bundles of blankets, Balaklava\r\nhelmets, woolen caps, furs, bulging mufflers (sometimes worn\r\nturban-wise), paddings and quiltings, knittings and double-knittings,\r\ncoverings and roofings and cowls, tarred or oiled or rubbered, black or\r\nall the colors (once upon a time) of the rainbow--all these things mask\r\nand magnify the men, and wipe out their uniforms almost as effectively\r\nas their skins. One has fastened on his back a square of linoleum, with\r\na big draught-board pattern in white and red, that he found in the\r\nmiddle of the dining-room of some temporary refuge. That is Pepin. We\r\nknow him afar off by his harlequin placard sooner even than by his pale\r\nApache face. Here is Barque\'s bulging chest-protector, carven from an\r\neiderdown quilt, formerly pink, but now fantastically bleached and\r\nmottled by dust and rain. There, Lamuse the Huge rises like a ruined\r\ntower to which tattered posters still cling. A cuirass of moleskin,\r\nwith the fur inside, adorns little Eudore with the burnished back of a\r\nbeetle; while the golden corselet of Tulacque the Big Chief surpasses\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe "tin hat" gives a certain sameness to the highest points of the\r\nbeings that are there, but even then the divers ways of wearing it--on\r\nthe regulation cap like Biquet, over a Balaklava like Cadilhac, or on a\r\ncotton cap like Barque--produce a complicated diversity of appearance.\r\n\r\nAnd our legs! I went down just now, bent double, into our dug-out, the\r\nlittle low cave that smells musty and damp, where one stumbles over\r\nempty jam-pots and dirty rags, where two long lumps lay asleep, while\r\nin the corner a kneeling shape rummaged a pouch by candle-light. As I\r\nclimbed out, the rectangle of entry afforded me a revelation of our\r\nlegs. Flat on the ground, vertically in the air, or aslant; spread\r\nabout, doubled up, or mixed together; blocking the fairway and cursed\r\nby passers-by, they present a collection of many colors and many\r\nshapes--gaiters, leggings black or yellow, long or short, in leather,\r\nin tawny cloth, in any sort of waterproof stuff; puttees in dark blue,\r\nlight blue, black, sage green, khaki, and beige. Alone of all his kind,\r\nVolpatte has retained the modest gaiters of mobilization. Mesnil Andre\r\nhas displayed for a fortnight a pair of thick woolen stockings, ribbed\r\nand green; and Tirette has always been known by his gray cloth puttees\r\nwith white stripes, commandeered from a pair of civilian trousers that\r\nwas hanging goodness knows where at the beginning of the war. As for\r\nMarthereau\'s puttees, they are not both of the same hue, for he failed\r\nto find two fag-ends of greatcoat equally worn and equally dirty, to be\r\ncut up into strips.\r\n\r\nThere are legs wrapped up in rags, too, and even in newspapers, which\r\nare kept in place with spirals of thread or--much more\r\npractical--telephone wire. Pepin fascinated his friends and the\r\npassers-by with a pair of fawn gaiters, borrowed from a corpse. Barque,\r\nwho poses as a resourceful man, full of ideas--and Heaven knows what a\r\nbore it makes of him at times!--has white calves, for he wrapped\r\nsurgical bandages round his leg-cloths to preserve them, a snowy\r\nsouvenir at his latter end of the cotton cap at the other, which\r\nprotrudes below his helmet and is left behind in its turn by a saucy\r\nred tassel. Poterloo has been walking about for a month in the boots of\r\na German soldier, nearly new, and with horseshoes on the heels. Caron\r\nentrusted them to Poterloo when he was sent back on account of his arm.\r\nCaron had taken them himself from a Bavarian machine-gunner, knocked\r\nout near the Pylones road. I can hear Caron telling about it yet--\r\n\r\n"Old man, he was there, his buttocks in a hole, doubled up, gaping at\r\nthe sky with his legs in the air, and his pumps offered themselves to\r\nme with an air that meant they were worth my while. \'A tight fit,\' says\r\nI. But you talk about a job to bring those beetle-crushers of his away!\r\nI worked on top of him, tugging, twisting and shaking, for half an hour\r\nand no lie about it. With his feet gone quite stiff, the patient didn\'t\r\nhelp me a bit. Then at last the legs of it--they\'d been pulled about\r\nso--came unstuck at the knees, and his breeks tore away, and all the\r\nlot came, flop! There was me, all of a sudden, with a full boot in each\r\nfist. The legs and feet had to be emptied out."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going it a bit strong!"\r\n\r\n"Ask Euterpe the cyclist if it isn\'t true. I tell you he did it along\r\nof me, too. We shoved our arms inside the boots and pulled out of \'em\r\nsome bones and bits of sock and bits of feet. But look if they weren\'t\r\nworth while!"\r\n\r\nSo, until Caron returns, Poterloo continues on his behalf the wearing\r\nof the Bavarian machine-gunner\'s boots.\r\n\r\nThus do they exercise their wits, according to their intelligence,\r\ntheir vivacity, their resources, and their boldness, in the struggle\r\nwith the terrible discomfort. Each one seems to make the revealing\r\ndeclaration, "This is all that I knew, all I was able, all that I dared\r\nto do in the great misery which has befallen me."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nMesnil Joseph drowses; Blaire yawns; Marthereau smokes, "eyes front."\r\nLamuse scratches himself like a gorilla, and Eudore like a marmoset.\r\nVolpatte coughs, and says, "I\'m kicking the bucket." Mesnil Andre has\r\ngot out his mirror and comb and is tending his fine chestnut beard as\r\nthough it were a rare plant. The monotonous calm is disturbed here and\r\nthere by the outbreaks of ferocious resentment provoked by the presence\r\nof parasites--endemic, chronic, and contagious.\r\n\r\nBarque, who is an observant man, sends an itinerant glance around,\r\ntakes his pipe from his mouth, spits, winks, and says--"I say, we don\'t\r\nresemble each other much."\r\n\r\n"Why should we?" says Lamuse. "It would be a miracle if we did."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nOur ages? We are of all ages. Ours is a regiment in reserve which\r\nsuccessive reinforcements have renewed partly with fighting units and\r\npartly with Territorials. In our half-section there are reservists of\r\nthe Territorial Army, new recruits, and demi-poils. Fouillade is forty;\r\nBlaire might be the father of Biquet, who is a gosling of Class 1913.\r\nThe corporal calls Marthereau "Grandpa" or "Old Rubbish-heap,"\r\naccording as in jest or in earnest. Mesnil Joseph would be at the\r\nbarracks if there were no war. It is a comical effect when we are in\r\ncharge of Sergeant Vigile, a nice little boy, with a dab on his lip by\r\nway of mustache. When we were in quarters the other day, he played at\r\nskipping-rope with the kiddies. In our ill-assorted flock, in this\r\nfamily without kindred, this home without a hearth at which we gather,\r\nthere are three generations side by side, living, waiting, standing\r\nstill, like unfinished statues, like posts.\r\n\r\nOur races? We are of all races; we come from everywhere. I look at the\r\ntwo men beside me. Poterloo, the miner from the Calonne pit, is pink;\r\nhis eyebrows are the color of straw, his eyes flax-blue. His great\r\ngolden head involved a long search in the stores to find the vast\r\nsteel-blue tureen that bonnets him. Fouillade, the boatman from Cette,\r\nrolls his wicked eyes in the long, lean face of a musketeer, with\r\nsunken cheeks and his skin the color of a violin. In good sooth, my two\r\nneighbors are as unlike as day and night.\r\n\r\nCocon, no less, a slight and desiccated person in spectacles, whose\r\ntint tells of corrosion in the chemical vapors of great towns,\r\ncontrasts with Biquet, a Breton in the rough, whose skin is gray and\r\nhis jaw like a paving-stone; and Mesnil Andre, the comfortable chemist\r\nfrom a country town in Normandy, who has such a handsome and silky\r\nbeard and who talks so much and so well--he has little in common with\r\nLamuse, the fat peasant of Poitou, whose cheeks and neck are like\r\nunderdone beef. The suburban accent of Barque, whose long legs have\r\nscoured the streets of Paris in all directions, alternates with the\r\nsemi-Belgian cadence of those Northerners who came from the 8th\r\nTerritorial; with the sonorous speech, rolling on the syllables as if\r\nover cobblestone, that the 144th pours out upon us; with the dialect\r\nblown from those ant-like clusters that the Auvergnats so obstinately\r\nform among the rest. I remember the first words of that wag, Tirette,\r\nwhen he arrived--"I, mes enfants, I am from Clichy-la-Garenne! Can any\r\none beat that?"--and the first grievance that Paradis brought to me,\r\n"They don\'t give a damn for me, because I\'m from Morvan!"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nOur callings? A little of all--in the lump. In those departed days when\r\nwe had a social status, before we came to immure our destiny in the\r\nmolehills that we must always build up again as fast as rain and\r\nscrap-iron beat them down, what were we? Sons of the soil and artisans\r\nmostly. Lamuse was a farm-servant, Paradis a carter. Cadilhac, whose\r\nhelmet rides loosely on his pointed head, though it is a juvenile\r\nsize--like a dome on a steeple, says Tirette--owns land. Papa Blaire\r\nwas a small farmer in La Brie. Barque, porter and messenger, performed\r\nacrobatic tricks with his carrier-tricycle among the trains and taxis\r\nof Paris, with solemn abuse (so they say) for the pedestrians, fleeing\r\nlike bewildered hens across the big streets and squares. Corporal\r\nBertrand, who keeps himself always a little aloof, correct, erect, and\r\nsilent, with a strong and handsome face and forthright gaze, was\r\nforeman in a case-factory. Tirloir daubed carts with paint--and without\r\ngrumbling, they say. Tulacque was barman at the Throne Tavern in the\r\nsuburbs; and Eudore of the pale and pleasant face kept a roadside cafe\r\nnot very far from the front lines. It has been ill-used by the\r\nshells--naturally, for we all know that Eudore has no luck. Mesnil\r\nAndre, who still retains a trace of well-kept distinction, sold\r\nbicarbonate and infallible remedies at his pharmacy in a Grande Place.\r\nHis brother Joseph was selling papers and illustrated story-books in a\r\nstation on the State Railways at the same time that, in far-off Lyons,\r\nCocon, the man of spectacles and statistics, dressed in a black smock,\r\nbusied himself behind the counters of an ironmongery, his hands\r\nglittering with plumbago; while the lamps of Becuwe Adolphe and\r\nPoterloo, risen with the dawn, trailed about the coalpits of the North\r\nlike weakling Will-o\'-th\'-wisps.\r\n\r\nAnd there are others amongst us whose occupations one can never recall,\r\nwhom one confuses with one another; and the rural nondescripts who\r\npeddled ten trades at once in their packs, without counting the dubious\r\nPepin, who can have had none at all. (While at the depot after sick\r\nleave, three months ago, they say, he got married--to secure the\r\nseparation allowance.)\r\n\r\nThe liberal professions are not represented among those around me. Some\r\nteachers are subalterns in the company or Red Cross men. In the\r\nregiment a Marist Brother is sergeant in the Service de Sante; a\r\nprofessional tenor is cyclist dispatch-rider to the Major; a "gentleman\r\nof independent means" is mess corporal to the C.H.R. But here there is\r\nnothing of all that. We are fighting men, we others, and we include\r\nhardly any intellectuals, or men of the arts or of wealth, who during\r\nthis war will have risked their faces only at the loopholes, unless in\r\npassing by, or under gold-laced caps.\r\n\r\nYes, we are truly and deeply different from each other. But we are\r\nalike all the same. In spite of this diversity of age, of country, of\r\neducation, of position, of everything possible, in spite of the former\r\ngulfs that kept us apart, we are in the main alike. Under the same\r\nuncouth outlines we conceal and reveal the same ways and habits, the\r\nsame simple nature of men who have reverted to the state primeval.\r\n\r\nThe same language, compounded of dialect and the slang of workshop and\r\nbarracks, seasoned with the latest inventions, blends us in the sauce\r\nof speech with the massed multitudes of men who (for seasons now) have\r\nemptied France and crowded together in the North-East.\r\n\r\nHere, too, linked by a fate from which there is no escape, swept\r\nwilly-nilly by the vast adventure into one rank, we have no choice but\r\nto go as the weeks and months go--alike. The terrible narrowness of the\r\ncommon life binds us close, adapts us, merges us one in the other. It\r\nis a sort of fatal contagion. Nor need you, to see how alike we\r\nsoldiers are, be afar off--at that distance, say, when we are only\r\nspecks of the dust-clouds that roll across the plain.\r\n\r\nWe are waiting. Weary of sitting, we get up, our joints creaking like\r\nwarping wood or old hinges. Damp rusts men as it rusts rifles; more\r\nslowly, but deeper. And we begin again, but not in the same way, to\r\nwait. In a state of war, one is always waiting. We have become\r\nwaiting-machines. For the moment it is food we are waiting for. Then it\r\nwill be the post. But each in its turn. When we have done with dinner\r\nwe will think about the letters. After that, we shall set ourselves to\r\nwait for something else.\r\n\r\nHunger and thirst are urgent instincts which formidably excite the\r\ntemper of my companions. As the meal gets later they become grumblesome\r\nand angry. Their need of food and drink snarls from their lips--"That\'s\r\neight o\'clock. Now, why the hell doesn\'t it come?"\r\n\r\n"Just so, and me that\'s been pining since noon yesterday," sulks\r\nLamuse, whose eyes are moist with longing, while his cheeks seem to\r\ncarry great daubs of wine-colored grease-paint.\r\n\r\nDiscontent grows more acute every minute.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet Plumet has poured down his own gullet my wine ration that\r\nhe\'s supposed to have, and others with it, and he\'s lying drunk over\r\nthere somewhere."\r\n\r\n"It\'s sure and certain"--Marthereau seconds the proposition.\r\n\r\n"Ah, the rotters, the vermin, these fatigue men!" Tirloir bellows. "An\r\nabominable race--all of \'em--mucky-nosed idlers! They roll over each\r\nother all day long at the rear, and they\'ll be damned before they\'ll be\r\nin time. Ah, if I were boss, they should damn quick take our places in\r\nthe trenches, and they\'d have to work for a change. To begin with, I\r\nshould say, \'Every man in the section will carry grease and soup in\r\nturns.\' Those who were willing, of course--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m confident," cries Cocon, "it\'s that Pepere that\'s keeping the\r\nothers back. He does it on purpose, firstly, and then, too, he can\'t\r\nfinish plucking himself in the morning, poor lad. He wants ten hours\r\nfor his flea-hunt, he\'s so finicking; and if he can\'t get \'em, monsieur\r\nhas the pip all day."\r\n\r\n"Be damned to him," growls Lamuse. "I\'d shift him out of bed if only I\r\nwas there! I\'d wake him up with boot-toe, I\'d--"\r\n\r\n"I was reckoning, the other day," Cocon went on; "it took him seven\r\nhours forty-seven minutes to come from thirty-one dug-out. It should\r\ntake him five good hours, but no longer."\r\n\r\nCocon is the Man of Figures. He has a deep affection, amounting to\r\nrapacity, for accuracy in recorded computation. On any subject at all,\r\nhe goes burrowing after statistics, gathers them with the industry of\r\nan insect, and serves them up on any one who will listen. Just now,\r\nwhile he wields his figures like weapons, the sharp ridges and angles\r\nand triangles that make up the paltry face where perch the double discs\r\nof his glasses, are contracted with vexation. He climbs to the\r\nfiring-step (made in the days when this was the first line), and raises\r\nhis head angrily over the parapet. The light touch of a little shaft of\r\ncold sunlight that lingers on the land sets a-glitter both his glasses\r\nand the diamond that hangs from his nose.\r\n\r\n"And that Pepere, too, talk about a drinking-cup with the bottom out!\r\nYou\'d never believe the weight of stuff he can let drop on a single\r\njourney."\r\n\r\nWith his pipe in the corner, Papa Blaire fumes in two senses. You can\r\nsee his heavy mustache trembling. It is like a comb made of bone,\r\nwhitish and drooping.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to know what I think? These dinner men, they\'re the\r\ndirtiest dogs of all. It\'s \'Blast this\' and \'Blast that\'--John Blast\r\nand Co., I call \'em."\r\n\r\n"They have all the elements of a dunghill about them," says Eudore,\r\nwith a sigh of conviction. He is prone on the ground, with his mouth\r\nhalf-open and the air of a martyr. With one fading eye he follows the\r\nmovements of Pepin, who prowls to and fro like a hyaena.\r\n\r\nTheir spiteful exasperation with the loiterers mounts higher and\r\nhigher. Tirloir the Grumbler takes the lead and expands. This is where\r\nhe comes in. With his little pointed gesticulations he goads and spurs\r\nthe anger all around him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, the devils, what? The sort of meat they threw at us yesterday!\r\nTalk about whetstones! Beef from an ox, that? Beef from a bicycle, yes\r\nrather! I said to the boys, \'Look here, you chaps, don\'t you chew it\r\ntoo quick, or you\'ll break your front teeth on the nails!\'"\r\n\r\nTirloir\'s harangue--he was manager of a traveling cinema, it\r\nseems--would have made us laugh at other times, but in the present\r\ntemper it is only echoed by a circulating growl.\r\n\r\n"Another time, so that you won\'t grumble about the toughness, they send\r\nyou something soft and flabby that passes for meat, something with the\r\nlook and the taste of a sponge--or a poultice. When you chew that, it\'s\r\nthe same as a cup of water, no more and no less."\r\n\r\n"Tout ca," says Lamuse, "has no substance; it gets no grip on your\r\nguts. You think you\'re full, but at the bottom of your tank you\'re\r\nempty. So, bit by bit, you turn your eyes up, poisoned for want of\r\nsustenance."\r\n\r\n"The next time," Biquet exclaims in desperation, "I shall ask to see\r\nthe old man, and I shall say, \'Mon capitaine\'--"\r\n\r\n"And I," says Barque, "shall make myself look sick, and I shall say,\r\n\'Monsieur le major\'--"\r\n\r\n"And get nix or the kick-out--they\'re all alike--all in a band to take\r\nit out of the poor private."\r\n\r\n"I tell you, they\'d like to get the very skin off us!"\r\n\r\n"And the brandy, too! We have a right to get it brought to the\r\ntrenches--as long as it\'s been decided somewhere--I don\'t know when or\r\nwhere, but I know it--and in the three days that we\'ve been here,\r\nthere\'s three days that the brandy\'s been dealt out to us on the end of\r\na fork!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, malheur!"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"There\'s the grub!" announces a poilu [note 1] who was on the look-out\r\nat the corner.\r\n\r\n"Time, too!"\r\n\r\nAnd the storm of revilings ceases as if by magic. Wrath is changed into\r\nsudden contentment.\r\n\r\nThree breathless fatigue men, their faces streaming with tears of\r\nsweat, put down on the ground some large tins, a paraffin can, two\r\ncanvas buckets, and a file of loaves, skewered on a stick. Leaning\r\nagainst the wall of the trench, they mop their faces with their\r\nhandkerchiefs or sleeves. And I see Cocon go up to Pepere with a smile,\r\nand forgetful of the abuse he had been heaping on the other\'s\r\nreputation, he stretches out a cordial hand towards one of the cans in\r\nthe collection that swells the circumference of Pepere, after the\r\nmanner of a life-belt.\r\n\r\n"What is there to eat?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s there," is the evasive reply of the second fatigue man, whom\r\nexperience has taught that a proclamation of the menu always evokes the\r\nbitterness of disillusion. So they set themselves to panting abuse of\r\nthe length and the difficulties of the trip they have just\r\naccomplished: "Some crowds about, everywhere! It\'s a tough job to get\r\nalong--got to disguise yourself as a cigarette paper, sometimes."--"And\r\nthere are people who say they\'re shirkers in the kitchens!" As for him,\r\nhe would a hundred thousand times rather be with the company in the\r\ntrenches, to mount guard and dig, than earn his keep by such a job,\r\ntwice a day during the night!\r\n\r\nParadis, having lifted the lids of the jars, surveys the recipients and\r\nannounces, "Kidney beans in oil, bully, pudding, and coffee--that\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Nom de Dieu!" bawls Tulacque. "And wine?" He summons the crowd: "Come\r\nand look here, all of you! That--that\'s the limit! We\'re done out of\r\nour wine!"\r\n\r\nAthirst and grimacing, they hurry up; and from the profoundest depths\r\nof their being wells up the chorus of despair and disappointment, "Oh,\r\nHell!"\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s that in there?" says the fatigue man, still ruddily\r\nsweating, and using his foot to point at a bucket.\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Paradis, "my mistake, there is some."\r\n\r\nThe fatigue man shrugs his shoulders, and hurls at Paradis a look of\r\nunspeakable scorn--"Now you\'re beginning! Get your gig-lamps on, if\r\nyour sight\'s bad." He adds, "One cup each--rather less perhaps--some\r\nchucklehead bumped against me, coming through the Boyau du Bois, and a\r\ndrop got spilled." "Ah!" he hastens to add, raising his voice, "if I\r\nhadn\'t been loaded up, talk about the boot-toe he\'d have got in the\r\nrump! But he hopped it on his top gear, the brute!"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this confident assurance, the fatigue man makes off\r\nhimself, curses overtaking him as he goes, maledictions charged with\r\noffensive reflections on his honesty and temperance, imprecations\r\ninspired by this revelation of a ration reduced.\r\n\r\nAll the same, they throw themselves on the food, and eat it standing,\r\nsquatting, kneeling, sitting on tins, or on haversacks pulled out of\r\nthe holes where they sleep--or even prone, their backs on the ground,\r\ndisturbed by passers-by, cursed at and cursing. Apart from these\r\nfleeting insults and jests, they say nothing, the primary and universal\r\ninterest being but to swallow, with their mouths and the circumference\r\nthereof as greasy as a rifle-breech. Contentment is theirs.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest cessation of their jaw-bones\' activity, they serve up\r\nthe most ribald of raillery. They knock each other about, and clamor in\r\nriotous rivalry to have their say. One sees even Farfadet smiling, the\r\nfrail municipal clerk who in the early days kept himself so decent and\r\nclean amongst us all that he was taken for a foreigner or a\r\nconvalescent. One sees the tomato-like mouth of Lamuse dilate and\r\ndivide, and his delight ooze out in tears. Poterloo\'s face, like a pink\r\npeony, opens out wider and wider. Papa Blaire\'s wrinkles flicker with\r\nfrivolity as he stands up, pokes his head forward, and gesticulates\r\nwith the abbreviated body that serves as a handle for his huge drooping\r\nmustache. Even the corrugations of Cocon\'s poor little face are lighted\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBecuwe goes in search of firewood to warm the coffee. While we wait for\r\nour drink, we roll cigarettes and fill pipes. Pouches are pulled out.\r\nSome of us have shop-acquired pouches in leather or rubber, but they\r\nare a minority. Biquet extracts his tobacco from a sock, of which the\r\nmouth is drawn tight with string. Most of the others use the bags for\r\nanti-gas pads, made of some waterproof material which is an excellent\r\npreservative of shag, be it coarse or fine; and there are those who\r\nsimply fumble for it in the bottom of their greatcoat pockets.\r\n\r\nThe smokers spit in a circle, just at the mouth of the dug-out which\r\nmost of the half-section inhabit, and flood with tobacco-stained saliva\r\nthe place where they put their hands and feet when they flatten\r\nthemselves to get in or out.\r\n\r\nBut who notices such a detail?\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nNow, a propos of a letter to Marthereau from his wife, they discuss\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n"La mere Marthereau has written," he says. "That fat pig we\'ve got at\r\nhome, a fine specimen, guess how much she\'s worth now?"\r\n\r\nBut the subject of domestic economy degenerates suddenly into a fierce\r\naltercation between Pepin and Tulacque. Words of quite unmistakable\r\nsignificance are exchanged. Then--"I don\'t care a what you say or what\r\nyou don\'t say! Shut it up!"--"I shall shut it when I want, midden!"--"A\r\nseven-pound thump would shut it up quick enough!"--"Who from? Who\'ll\r\ngive it me?"--"Come and find out!"\r\n\r\nThey grind their teeth and approach each other in a foaming rage.\r\nTulacque grasps his prehistoric ax, and his squinting eyes are\r\nflashing. The other is pale and his eyes have a greenish glint; you can\r\nsee in his blackguard face that his thoughts are with his knife.\r\n\r\nBut between the two, as they grip each other in looks and mangle in\r\nwords, Lamuse intervenes with his huge pacific head, like a baby\'s, and\r\nhis face of sanguinary hue: "Allons, allons! You\'re not going to cut\r\nyourselves up! Can\'t be allowed!"\r\n\r\nThe others also interpose, and the antagonists are separated, but they\r\ncontinue to hurl murderous looks at each other across the barrier of\r\ntheir comrades. Pepin mutters a residue of slander in tones that quiver\r\nwith malice--\r\n\r\n"The hooligan, the ruffian, the blackguard! But wait a bit! I\'ll see\r\nhim later about this!"\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Tulacque confides in the poilu who is beside him:\r\n"That crab-louse! Non, but you know what he is! You know--there\'s no\r\nmore to be said. Here, we\'ve got to rub along with a lot of people that\r\nwe don\'t know from Adam. We know \'em and yet we don\'t know \'em; but\r\nthat man, if he thinks he can mess me about, he\'ll find himself up the\r\nwrong street! You wait a bit. I\'ll smash him up one of these days,\r\nyou\'ll see!"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the general conversation is resumed, drowning the last twin\r\nechoes of the quarrel.\r\n\r\n"It\'s every day alike, alors!" says Paradis to me; "yesterday it was\r\nPlaisance who wanted to let Fumex have it heavy on the jaw, about God\r\nknows what--a matter of opium pills, I think. First it\'s one and then\r\nit\'s another that talks of doing some one in. Are we getting to be a\r\nlot of wild animals because we look like \'em?"\r\n\r\n"Mustn\'t take them too seriously, these men," Lamuse declares; "they\'re\r\nonly kids."\r\n\r\n"True enough, seeing that they\'re men."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe day matures. A little more light has trickled through the mists\r\nthat enclose the earth. But the sky has remained overcast, and now it\r\ndissolves in rain; With a slowness which itself disheartens, the wind\r\nbrings back its great wet void upon us. The rain-haze makes everything\r\nclammy and dull--even the Turkey red of Lamuse\'s cheeks, and even the\r\norange armor that caparisons Tulacque. The water penetrates to the deep\r\njoy with which dinner endowed us, and puts it out. Space itself\r\nshrinks; and the sky, which is a field of melancholy, comes closely\r\ndown upon the earth, which is a field of death.\r\n\r\nWe are still there, implanted and idle. It will be hard to-day to reach\r\nthe end of it, to get rid of the afternoon. We shiver in discomfort,\r\nand keep shifting our positions, like cattle enclosed.\r\n\r\nCocon is explaining to his neighbor the arrangement and intricacy of\r\nour trenches. He has seen a military map and made some calculations. In\r\nthe sector occupied by our regiment there are fifteen lines of French\r\ntrenches. Some are abandoned, invaded by grass, and half leveled; the\r\nothers solidly upkept and bristling with men. These parallels are\r\njoined up by innumerable galleries which hook and crook themselves like\r\nancient streets. The system is much more dense than we believe who live\r\ninside it. On the twenty-five kilometers\' width that form the army\r\nfront, one must count on a thousand kilometers of hollowed\r\nlines--trenches and saps of all sorts. And the French Army consists of\r\nten such armies. There are then, on the French side, about 10,000\r\nkilometers [note 2] of trenches, and as much again on the German side.\r\nAnd the French front is only about one-eighth of the whole war-front of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThus speaks Cocon, and he ends by saying to his neighbor, "In all that\r\nlot, you see what we are, us chaps?"\r\n\r\nPoor Barque\'s head droops. His face, bloodless as a slum child\'s, is\r\nunderlined by a red goatee that punctuates his hair like an apostrophe:\r\n"Yes, it\'s true, when you come to think of it. What\'s a soldier, or\r\neven several soldiers?--Nothing, and less than nothing, in the whole\r\ncrowd; and so we see ourselves lost, drowned, like the few drops of\r\nblood that we are among all this flood of men and things."\r\n\r\nBarque sighs and is silent, and the end of his discourse gives a chance\r\nof hearing to a bit of jingling narrative, told in an undertone: "He\r\nwas coming along with two horses--Fs-s-s--a shell; and he\'s only one\r\nhorse left."\r\n\r\n"You get fed up with it," says Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"But you stick it," growls Barque.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to," says Paradis.\r\n\r\n"Why?" asks Marthereau, without conviction.\r\n\r\n"No need for a reason, as long as we\'ve got to."\r\n\r\n"There is no reason," Lamuse avers.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is," says Cocon. "It\'s--or rather, there are several."\r\n\r\n"Shut it up! Much better to have no reason, as long as we\'ve got to\r\nstick it."\r\n\r\n"All the same," comes the hollow voice of Blaire, who lets no chance\r\nslip of airing his pet phrase--"All the same, they\'d like to steal the\r\nvery skin off us!"\r\n\r\n"At the beginning of it," says Tirette, "I used to think about a heap\r\nof things. I considered and calculated. Now, I don\'t think any more."\r\n\r\n"Nor me either."\r\n\r\n"Nor me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never tried to."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not such a fool as you look, flea-face," says the shrill and\r\njeering voice of Mesnil Andre. Obscurely flattered, the other develops\r\nhis theme--\r\n\r\n"To begin with, you can\'t know anything about anything."\r\n\r\nSays Corporal Bertrand, "There\'s only one thing you need know, and it\'s\r\nthis; that the Boches are here in front of us, deep dug in, and we\'ve\r\ngot to see that they don\'t get through, and we\'ve got to put \'em out,\r\none day or another--as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"Oui, oui, they\'ve got to leg it, and no mistake about it. What else is\r\nthere? Not worth while to worry your head thinking about anything else.\r\nBut it\'s a long job."\r\n\r\nAn explosion of profane assent comes from Fouillade, and he adds,\r\n"That\'s what it is!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve given up grousing," says Barque. "At the beginning of it, I\r\nplayed hell with everybody--with the people at the rear, with the\r\ncivilians, with the natives, with the shirkers. Yes, I played hell; but\r\nthat was at the beginning of the war--I was young. Now, I take things\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one way of taking \'em--as they come!"\r\n\r\n"Of course! Otherwise, you\'d go crazy. We\'re dotty enough already, eh,\r\nFirmin?"\r\n\r\nVolpatte assents with a nod of profound conviction. He spits, and then\r\ncontemplates his missile with a fixed and unseeing eye.\r\n\r\n"You were saying?" insists Barque.\r\n\r\n"Here, you haven\'t got to look too far in front. You must live from day\r\nto day and from hour to hour, as well as you can."\r\n\r\n"Certain sure, monkey-face. We\'ve got to do what they tell us to do,\r\nuntil they tell us to go away."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," yawns Mesnil Joseph.\r\n\r\nSilence follows the recorded opinions that proceed from these dried and\r\ntanned faces, inlaid with dust. This, evidently, is the credo of the\r\nmen who, a year and a half ago, left all the corners of the land to\r\nmass themselves on the frontier: Give up trying to understand, and give\r\nup trying to be yourself. Hope that you will not die, and fight for\r\nlife as well as you can.\r\n\r\n"Do what you\'ve got to do, oui, but get out of your own messes\r\nyourself," says Barque, as he slowly stirs the mud to and fro.\r\n\r\n"No choice"--Tulacque backs him up. "If you don\'t get out of \'em\r\nyourself, no one\'ll do it for you."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not yet quite extinct, the man that bothers about the other\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\n"Every man for himself, in war!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s so, that\'s so."\r\n\r\nSilence. Then from the depth of their destitution, these men summon\r\nsweet souvenirs--"All that," Barque goes on, "isn\'t worth much,\r\ncompared with the good times we had at Soissons."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the Devil!"\r\n\r\nA gleam of Paradise lost lights up their eyes and seems even to redden\r\ntheir cold faces.\r\n\r\n"Talk about a festival!" sighs Tirloir, as he leaves off scratching\r\nhimself, and looks pensively far away over Trenchland.\r\n\r\n"Ah, nom de Dieu! All that town, nearly abandoned, that used to be\r\nours! The houses and the beds--"\r\n\r\n"And the cupboards!"\r\n\r\n"And the cellars!"\r\n\r\nLamuse\'s eyes are wet, his face like a nosegay, his heart full.\r\n\r\n"Were you there long?" asks Cadilhac, who came here later, with the\r\ndrafts from Auvergne.\r\n\r\n"Several months."\r\n\r\nThe conversation had almost died out, but it flames up again fiercely\r\nat this vision of the days of plenty.\r\n\r\n"We used to see," said Paradis dreamily, "the poilus pouring along and\r\nbehind the houses on the way back to camp with fowls hung round their\r\nmiddles, and a rabbit under each arm, borrowed from some good fellow or\r\nwoman that they hadn\'t seen and won\'t ever see again."\r\n\r\nWe reflect on the far-off flavor of chicken and rabbit. "There were\r\nthings that we paid for, too. The spondu-licks just danced about. We\r\nheld all the aces in those days."\r\n\r\n"A hundred thousand francs went rolling round the shops."\r\n\r\n"Millions, oui. All the day, just a squandering that you\'ve no idea of,\r\na sort of devil\'s delight."\r\n\r\n"Believe me or not," said Blaire to Cadilhac, "but in the middle of it\r\nall, what we had the least of was fires, just like here and everywhere\r\nelse you go. You had to chase it and find it and stick to it. Ah, mon\r\nvieux, how we did run after the kindlings!"\r\n\r\n"Well, we were in the camp of the C.H.R. The cook there was the great\r\nMartin Cesar. He was the man for finding wood!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, oui, oui! He was the ace of trumps! He got what he wanted without\r\ntwisting himself."\r\n\r\n"Always some fire in his kitchen, young fellow. You saw cooks chasing\r\nand gabbling about the streets in all directions, blubbering because\r\nthey had no coal or wood. But he\'d got a fire. When he hadn\'t any, he\r\nsaid, \'Don\'t worry, I\'ll see you through.\' And he wasn\'t long about it,\r\neither."\r\n\r\n"He went a bit too far, even. The first time I saw him in his kitchen,\r\nyou\'d never guess what he\'d got the stew going with! With a violin that\r\nhe\'d found in the house!"\r\n\r\n"Rotten, all the same," says Mesnil Andre. "One knows well enough that\r\na violin isn\'t worth much when it comes to utility, but all the same--"\r\n\r\n"Other times, he used billiard cues. Zizi just succeeded in pinching\r\none for a cane, but the rest--into the fire! Then the arm-chairs in the\r\ndrawing-room went by degrees--mahogany, they were. He did \'em in and\r\ncut them up by night, case some N.C.O. had something to say about it."\r\n\r\n"He knew his way about," said Pepin. "As for us, we got busy with an\r\nold suite of furniture that lasted us a fortnight."\r\n\r\n"And what for should we be without? You\'ve got to make dinner, and\r\nthere\'s no wood or coal. After the grub\'s served out, there you are\r\nwith your jaws empty, with a pile of meat in front of you, and in the\r\nmiddle of a lot of pals that chaff and bullyrag you!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the War Office\'s doing, it isn\'t ours."\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t the officers a lot to say about the pinching?"\r\n\r\n"They damn well did it themselves, I give you my word! Desmaisons, do\r\nyou remember Lieutenant Virvin\'s trick, breaking down a cellar door\r\nwith an ax? And when a poilu saw him at it, he gave him the door for\r\nfirewood, so that he wouldn\'t spread it about."\r\n\r\n"And poor old Saladin, the transport officer. He was found coming out\r\nof a basement in the dusk with two bottles of white wine in each arm,\r\nthe sport, like a nurse with two pairs of twins. When he was spotted,\r\nthey made him go back down to the wine-cellar, and serve out bottles\r\nfor everybody. But Corporal Bertrand, who is a man of scruples,\r\nwouldn\'t have any. Ah, you remember that, do you, sausage-foot!"\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that cook now that always found wood?" asks Cadilhac.\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead. A bomb fell in his stove. He didn\'t get it, but he\'s dead\r\nall the same--died of shock when he saw his macaroni with its legs in\r\nthe air. Heart seizure, so the doc\' said. His heart was weak--he was\r\nonly strong on wood. They gave him a proper funeral--made him a coffin\r\nout of the bedroom floor, and got the picture nails out of the walls to\r\nfasten \'em together, and used bricks to drive \'em in. While they were\r\ncarrying him off, I thought to myself, \'Good thing for him he\'s dead.\r\nIf he saw that, he\'d never be able to forgive himself for not having\r\nthought of the bedroom floor for his fire.\'--Ah, what the devil are you\r\ndoing, son of a pig?"\r\n\r\nVolpatte offers philosophy on the rude intrusion of a passing fatigue\r\nparty: "The private gets along on the back of his pals. When you spin\r\nyour yarns in front of a fatigue gang, or when you take the best bit or\r\nthe best place, it\'s the others that suffer."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve often," says Lamuse, "put up dodges so as not to go into the\r\ntrenches, and it\'s come off no end of times. I own up to that. But when\r\nmy pals are in danger, I\'m not a dodger any more. I forget discipline\r\nand everything else. I see men, and I go. But otherwise, my boy, I look\r\nafter my little self."\r\n\r\nLamuse\'s claims are not idle words. He is an admitted expert at\r\nloafing, but all the same he has brought wounded in under fire and\r\nsaved their lives. Without any brag, he relates the deed--\r\n\r\n"We were all lying on the grass, and having a hot time. Crack, crack!\r\nWhizz, whizz! When I saw them downed, I got up, though they yelled at\r\nme, \'Get down!\' Couldn\'t leave \'em like that. Nothing to make a song\r\nabout, seeing I couldn\'t do anything else."\r\n\r\nNearly all the boys of the squad have some high deed of arms to their\r\ncredit, and the Croix de Guerre has been successively set upon their\r\nbreasts.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t saved any Frenchmen," says Biquet, "but I\'ve given some\r\nBoches the bitter pill." In the May attacks, he ran off in advance and\r\nwas seen to disappear in the distance, but came back with four fine\r\nfellows in helmets.\r\n\r\n"I, too," says Tulacque, "I\'ve killed some." Two months ago, with\r\nquaint vanity, he laid out nine in a straight row, in front of the\r\ntaken trench. "But," he adds, "it\'s always the Boche officer that I\'m\r\nafter."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the beasts!" The curse comes from several men at once and from the\r\nbottom of their hearts.\r\n\r\n"Ah, mon vieux," says Tirloir, "we talk about the dirty Boche race; but\r\nas for the common soldier, I don\'t know if it\'s true or whether we\'re\r\ncodded about that as well, and if at bottom they\'re not men pretty much\r\nlike us."\r\n\r\n"Probably they\'re men like us," says Eudore.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps!" cries Cocon, "and perhaps not."\r\n\r\n"Anyway," Tirloir goes on, "we\'ve not got a dead set on the men, but on\r\nthe German officers; non, non, non, they\'re not men, they\'re monsters.\r\nI tell you, they\'re really a specially filthy sort o\' vermin. One might\r\nsay that they\'re the microbes of the war. You ought to see them close\r\nto--the infernal great stiff-backs, thin as nails, though they\'ve got\r\ncalf-heads."\r\n\r\n"And snouts like snakes."\r\n\r\nTirloir continues: "I saw one once, a prisoner, as I came back from\r\nliaison. The beastly bastard! A Prussian colonel, that wore a prince\'s\r\ncrown, so they told me, and a gold coat-of-arms. He was mad because we\r\ntook leave to graze against him when they were bringing him back along\r\nthe communication trench, and he looked down on everybody--like that. I\r\nsaid to myself, \'Wait a bit, old cock, I\'ll make you rattle directly!\'\r\nI took my time and squared up behind him, and kicked into his tailpiece\r\nwith all my might. I tell you, he fell down half-strangled."\r\n\r\n"Strangled?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, with rage, when it dawned on him that the rump of an officer and\r\nnobleman had been bust in by the hobnailed socks of a poor private! He\r\nwent off chattering like a woman and wriggling like an epileptic--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not spiteful myself," says Blaire, "I\'ve got kiddies. And it\r\nworries me, too, at home, when I\'ve got to kill a pig that I know--but\r\nthose, I shall run \'em through--Bing!--full in the linen-cupboard."\r\n\r\n"I, too."\r\n\r\n"Not to mention," says Pepin, "that they\'ve got silver hats, and\r\npistols that you can get four quid for whenever you like, and\r\nfield-glasses that simply haven\'t got a price. Ah, bad luck, what a lot\r\nof chances I let slip in the early part of the campaign! I was too much\r\nof a beginner then, and it serves me right. But don\'t worry, I shall\r\nget a silver hat. Mark my words, I swear I\'ll have one. I must have not\r\nonly the skin of one of Wilhelm\'s red-tabs, but his togs as well. Don\'t\r\nfret yourself; I\'ll fasten on to that before the war ends."\r\n\r\n"You think it\'ll have an end, then?" asks some one.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry!" replies the other.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a hubbub has arisen to the right of us, and suddenly a\r\nmoving and buzzing group appears, in which dark and bright forms mingle.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all that?"\r\n\r\nBiquet has ventured on a reconnaissance, and returns contemptuously\r\npointing with his thumb towards the motley mass: "Eh, boys! Come and\r\nhave a squint at them! Some people!"\r\n\r\n"Some people?"\r\n\r\n"Oui, some gentlemen, look you. Civvies, with Staff officers."\r\n\r\n"Civilians! Let\'s hope they\'ll stick it!" [note 3]\r\n\r\nIt is the sacramental saying and evokes laughter, although we have\r\nheard it a hundred times, and although the soldier has rightly or\r\nwrongly perverted the original meaning and regards it as an ironical\r\nreflection on his life of privations and peril.\r\n\r\nTwo Somebodies come up; two Somebodies with overcoats and canes.\r\nAnother is dressed in a sporting suit, adorned with a plush hat and\r\nbinoculars. Pale blue tunics, with shining belts of fawn color or\r\npatent leather, follow and steer the civilians.\r\n\r\nWith an arm where a brassard glitters in gold-edged silk and golden\r\nornament, a captain indicates the firing-step in front of an old\r\nemplacement and invites the visitors to get up and try it. The\r\ngentleman in the touring suit clambers up with the aid of his umbrella.\r\n\r\nSays Barque, "You\'ve seen the station-master at the Gare du Nord, all\r\nin his Sunday best, and opening the door of a first-class compartment\r\nfor a rich sportsman on the first day of the shooting? With his\r\n\'Montez, monsieur le Propritaire!\'--you know, when the toffs are all\r\ntogged up in brand-new outfits and leathers and ironmongery, and\r\nshowing off with all their paraphernalia for killing poor little\r\nanimals!"\r\n\r\nThree or four poilus who were quite without their accouterments have\r\ndisappeared underground. The others sit as though paralyzed. Even the\r\npipes go out, and nothing is heard but the babble of talk exchanged by\r\nthe officers and their guests.\r\n\r\n"Trench tourists," says Barque in an undertone, and then louder--"This\r\nway, mesdames et messieurs"--in the manner of the moment.\r\n\r\n"Chuck it!" whispers Farfadet, fearing that Barque\'s malicious tongue\r\nwill draw the attention of the potent personages.\r\n\r\nSome heads in the group are now turned our way. One gentleman who\r\ndetaches himself and comes up wears a soft hat and a loose tie. He has\r\na white billy-goat beard, and might be an artiste. Another follows him,\r\nwearing a black overcoat, a black bowler hat, a black beard, a white\r\ntie and an eyeglass.\r\n\r\n"Ah, ah! There are some poilus," says the first gentleman. "These are\r\nreal poilus, indeed."\r\n\r\nHe comes up to our party a little timidly, as though in the Zoological\r\nGardens, and offers his hand to the one who is nearest to him--not\r\nwithout awkwardness, as one offers a piece of bread to the elephant.\r\n\r\n"He, he! They are drinking coffee," he remarks.\r\n\r\n"They call it \'the juice,\'" corrects the magpie-man.\r\n\r\n"Is it good, my friends?" The soldier, abashed in his turn by this\r\nalien and unusual visitation, grunts, giggles, and reddens, and the\r\ngentleman says, "He, he!" Then, with a slight motion of the head, he\r\nwithdraws backwards.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage, with its neutral shades of civilian cloth and its\r\nsprinkling of bright military hues--like geraniums and hortensias in\r\nthe dark soil of a flowerbed--oscillates, then passes, and moves off\r\nthe opposite way it came. One of the officers was heard to say, "We\r\nhave yet much to see, messieurs les journalistes."\r\n\r\nWhen the radiant spectacle has faded away, we look at each other. Those\r\nwho had fled into the funk-holes now gradually and head first disinter\r\nthemselves. The group recovers itself and shrugs its shoulders.\r\n\r\n"They\'re journalists," says Tirette.\r\n\r\n"Journalists?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, the individuals that lay the newspapers. You don\'t seem to\r\ncatch on, fathead. Newspapers must have chaps to write \'em."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s those that stuff up our craniums?" says Marthereau.\r\n\r\nBarque assumes a shrill treble, and pretending that he has a newspaper\r\nin front of his nose, recites--"\'The Crown Prince is mad, after having\r\nbeen killed at the beginning of the campaign, and meanwhile he has all\r\nthe diseases you can name. William will die this evening, and again\r\nto-morrow. The Germans have no more munitions and are chewing wood.\r\nThey cannot hold out, according to the most authoritative calculations,\r\nbeyond the end of the week. We can have them when we like, with their\r\nrifles slung. If one can wait a few days longer, there will be no\r\ndesire to forsake the life of the trenches. One is so comfortable\r\nthere, with water and gas laid on, and shower-baths at every step. The\r\nonly drawback is that it is rather too hot in winter. As for the\r\nAustrians, they gave in a long time since and are only pretending.\' For\r\nfifteen months now it\'s been like that, and you can hear the editor\r\nsaying to his scribes, \'Now, boys, get into it! Find some way of\r\nbrushing that up again for me in five secs, and make it spin out all\r\nover those four damned white sheets that we\'ve got to mucky.\'"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes!" says Fouillade.\r\n\r\n"Look here, corporal; you\'re making fun of it--isn\'t it true what I\r\nsaid?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s a little truth in it, but you\'re too slashing on the poor\r\nboys, and you\'d be the first to make a song about it if you had to go\r\nwithout papers. Oui, when the paper-man\'s going by, why do you all\r\nshout, \'Here, here\'?"\r\n\r\n"And what good can you get out of them all?" cries Papa Blaire. "Read\r\n\'em by the tubful if you like, but do the same as me--don\'t believe\r\n\'em!"\r\n\r\n"Oui, oui, that\'s enough about them. Turn the page over, donkey-nose."\r\n\r\nThe conversation is breaking up; interest in it follows suit and is\r\nscattered. Four poilus join in a game of manille, that will last until\r\nnight blacks out the cards. Volpatte is trying to catch a leaf of\r\ncigarette paper that has escaped his fingers and goes hopping and\r\ndodging in the wind along the wall of the trench like a fragile\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nCocon and Tirette are recalling their memories of barrack-life. The\r\nimpressions left upon their minds by those years of military training\r\nare ineffaceable. Into that fund of abundant souvenirs, of abiding\r\ncolor and instant service, they have been wont to dip for their\r\nsubjects of conversation for ten, fifteen, or twenty years. So that\r\nthey still frequent it, even after a year and a half of actual war in\r\nall its forms.\r\n\r\nI can hear some of the talk and guess the rest of it. For it is\r\neverlastingly the same sort of tale that they get out of their military\r\npast;--the narrator once shut up a bad-tempered N.C.O. with words of\r\nextreme appropriateness and daring. He wasn\'t afraid, he spoke out loud\r\nand strong! Some scraps of it reach my ears--\r\n\r\n"Alors, d\'you think I flinched when Nenoeil said that to me? Not a bit,\r\nmy boy. All the pals kept their jaws shut but me; I spoke up, \'Mon\r\nadjudant,\' I says, \'it\'s possible, but--\'" A sentence follows that I\r\ncannot secure--"Oh, tu sais, just like that, I said it. He didn\'t get\r\nshirty; \'Good, that\'s good,\' he says as he hops it, and afterwards he\r\nwas as good as all that, with me."\r\n\r\n"Just like me, with Dodore, \'jutant of the 13th, when I was on leave--a\r\nmongrel. Now he\'s at the Pantheon, as caretaker. He\'d got it in for me,\r\nso--"\r\n\r\nSo each unpacks his own little load of historical anecdote. They are\r\nall alike, and not one of them but says, "As for me, I am not like the\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe post-orderly! He is a tall and broad man with fat calves;\r\ncomfortable looking, and as neat and tidy as a policeman. He is in a\r\nbad temper. There are new orders, and now he has to go every day as far\r\nas Battalion Headquarters. He abuses the order as if it had been\r\ndirected exclusively against himself; and he continues to complain even\r\nwhile he calls up the corporals for the post and maintains his\r\ncustomary chat en passant with this man and that. And in spite of his\r\nspleen he does not keep to himself all the information with which he\r\ncomes provided. While removing the string from the letter-packets he\r\ndispenses his verbal news, and announces first, that according to\r\nrumor, there is a very explicit ban on the wearing of hoods.\r\n\r\n"Hear that?" says Tirette to Tirloir. "Got to chuck your fine hood\r\naway!"\r\n\r\n"Not likely! I\'m not on. That\'s nothing to do with me," replies the\r\nhooded one, whose pride no less than his comfort is at stake.\r\n\r\n"Order of the General Commanding the Army."\r\n\r\n"Then let the General give an order that it\'s not to rain any more. I\r\nwant to know nothing about it."\r\n\r\nThe majority of Orders, even when less peculiar than this one, are\r\nalways received in this way--and then carried out.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a reported order as well," says the man of letters, "that\r\nbeards have got to be trimmed and hair got to be clipped close."\r\n\r\n"Talk on, my lad," says Barque, on whose head the threatened order\r\ndirectly falls; "you didn\'t see me! You can draw the curtains!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m telling you. Do it or don\'t do it--doesn\'t matter a damn to me."\r\n\r\nBesides what is real and written, there is bigger news, but still more\r\ndubious and imaginative--the division is going to be relieved, and sent\r\neither to rest--real rest, for six weeks--or to Morocco, or perhaps to\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nDivers exclamations. They listen, and let themselves be tempted by the\r\nfascination of the new, the wonderful.\r\n\r\nBut some one questions the post-orderly: "Who told you that?"\r\n\r\n"The adjutant commanding the Territorial detachment that fatigues for\r\nthe H.Q. of the A.C."\r\n\r\n"For the what?"\r\n\r\n"For Headquarters of the Army Corps, and he\'s not the only one that\r\nsays it. There\'s--you know him--I\'ve forgotten his name--he\'s like\r\nGalle, but he isn\'t Galle--there\'s some one in his family who is Some\r\nOne. Anyway, he knows all about it."\r\n\r\n"Then what?" With hungry eyes they form a circle around the\r\nstory-teller.\r\n\r\n"Egypt, you say, we shall go to? Don\'t know it. I know there were\r\nPharaohs there at the time when I was a kid and went to school, but\r\nsince--"\r\n\r\n"To Egypt!" The idea finds unconscious anchorage in their minds.\r\n\r\n"Ah, non," says Blaire, "for I get sea-sick. Still, it doesn\'t last,\r\nsea-sickness. Oui, but what would my good lady say?"\r\n\r\n"What about it? She\'ll get used to it. You see niggers, and streets\r\nfull of big birds, like we see sparrows here."\r\n\r\n"But haven\'t we to go to Alsace?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," says the post-orderly, "there are some who think so at the\r\nPay-office."\r\n\r\n"That\'d do me well enough."\r\n\r\nBut common sense and acquired experience regain the upper hand and put\r\nthe visions to flight. We have been told so often that we were going a\r\nlong way off, so often have we believed it, so often been undeceived!\r\nSo, as if at a moment arranged, we wake up.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all my eye--they\'ve done it on us too often. Wait before\r\nbelieving--and don\'t count a crumb\'s worth on it."\r\n\r\nWe reoccupy our corner. Here and there a man bears in his hand the\r\nlight momentous burden of a letter.\r\n\r\n"Ah," says Tirloir, "I must be writing. Can\'t go eight days without\r\nwriting."\r\n\r\n"Me too," says Eudore, "I must write to my p\'tit\' femme."\r\n\r\n"Is she all right, Mariette?"\r\n\r\n"Oui, oui, don\'t fret about Mariette."\r\n\r\nA few have already settled themselves for correspondence. Barque is\r\nstanding up. He stoops over a sheet of paper flattened on a note-book\r\nupon a jutting crag in the trench wall. Apparently in the grip of an\r\ninspiration, he writes on and on, with his eyes in bondage and the\r\nconcentrated expression of a horseman at full gallop.\r\n\r\nWhen once Lamuse--who lacks imagination--has sat down, placed his\r\nlittle writing-block on the padded summit of his knees, and moistened\r\nhis copying-ink pencil, he passes the time in reading again the last\r\nletters received, in wondering what he can say that he has not already\r\nsaid, and in fostering a grim determination to say something else.\r\n\r\nA sentimental gentleness seems to have overspread little Eudore, who is\r\ncurled up in a sort of niche in the ground. He is lost in meditation,\r\npencil in hand, eyes on paper. Dreaming, he looks and stares and sees.\r\nIt is another sky that lends him light, another to which his vision\r\nreaches. He has gone home.\r\n\r\nIn this time of letter-writing, the men reveal the most and the best\r\nthat they ever were. Several others surrender to the past, and its\r\nfirst expression is to talk once more of fleshly comforts.\r\n\r\nThrough their outer crust of coarseness and concealment, other hearts\r\nventure upon murmured memories, and the rekindling of bygone\r\nbrightness: the summer morning, when the green freshness of the garden\r\nsteals in upon the purity of the country bedroom; or when the wind in\r\nthe wheat of the level lands sets it slowly stirring or deeply waving,\r\nand shakes the square of oats hard by into quick little feminine\r\ntremors; or the winter evening, with women and their gentleness around\r\nthe shaded luster of the lamp.\r\n\r\nBut Papa Blaire resumes work upon the ring he has begun. He has\r\nthreaded the still formless disc of aluminium over a bit of rounded\r\nwood, and rubs it with the file. As he applies himself to the job, two\r\nwrinkles of mighty meditation deepen upon his forehead. Anon he stops,\r\nstraightens himself, and looks tenderly at the trifle, as though she\r\nalso were looking at it.\r\n\r\n"You know," he said to me once, speaking of another ring, "it\'s not a\r\nquestion of doing it well or not well. The point is that I\'ve done it\r\nfor my wife, d\'you see? When I had nothing to do but scratch myself, I\r\nused to have a look at this photo"--he showed me a photograph of a big,\r\nchubby-faced woman--"and then it was quite easy to set about this\r\ndamned ring. You might say that we\'ve made it together, see? The proof\r\nof that is that it was company for me, and that I said Adieu to it when\r\nI sent it off to Mother Blaire."\r\n\r\nHe is making another just now, and this one will have copper in it,\r\ntoo. He works eagerly. His heart would fain express itself to the best\r\nadvantage in this the sort of penmanship upon which he is so\r\ntenaciously bent.\r\n\r\nAs they stoop reverently, in their naked earth-holes, over the slender\r\nrudimentary trinkets--so tiny that the great hide-bound hands hold them\r\nwith difficulty or let them fall--these men seem still more wild, more\r\nprimitive, and more human, than at all other times.\r\n\r\nYou are set thinking of the first inventor, the father of all\r\ncraftsmen, who sought to invest enduring materials with the shapes of\r\nwhat he saw and the spirit of what he felt.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"People coming along," announces Biquet the mobile, who acts as\r\nhall-porter to our section of the trench--"buckets of \'em." Immediately\r\nan adjutant appears, with straps round his belly and his chin, and\r\nbrandishing his sword-scabbard.\r\n\r\n"Out of the way, you! Out of the way, I tell you! You loafers there,\r\nout of it! Let me see you quit, hey!" We make way indolently. Those at\r\nthe sides push back into the earth by slow degrees.\r\n\r\nIt is a company of Territorials, deputed to our sector for the\r\nfortification of the second line and the upkeep of its communication\r\ntrenches. They come into view--miserable bundles of implements, and\r\ndragging their feet.\r\n\r\nWe watch them, one by one, as they come up, pass, and disappear. They\r\nare stunted and elderly, with dusty faces, or big and broken-winded,\r\ntightly enfolded in greatcoats stained and over-worn, that yawn at the\r\ntoothless gaps where the buttons are missing.\r\n\r\nTirette and Barque, the twin wags, leaning close together against the\r\nwall, stare at them, at first in silence. Then they begin to smile.\r\n\r\n"March past of the Broom Brigade," says Tirette.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have a bit of fun for three minutes," announces Barque.\r\n\r\nSome of the old toilers are comical. This one whom the file brings up\r\nhas bottle-shaped shoulders. Although extremely narrow-chested and\r\nspindle-shanked, he is big-bellied. He is too much for Barque. "Hullo,\r\nSir Canteen!" he says.\r\n\r\nWhen a more outrageously patched-up greatcoat appears than all the\r\nothers can show, Tirette questions the veteran recruit. "Hey, Father\r\nSamples! Hey, you there!" he insists.\r\n\r\nThe other turns and looks at him, open-mouthed.\r\n\r\n"Say there, papa, if you will be so kind as to give me the address of\r\nyour tailor in London!"\r\n\r\nA chuckle comes from the antiquated and wrinkle-scrawled face, and then\r\nthe poilu, checked for an instant by Barque\'s command, is jostled by\r\nthe following flood and swept away.\r\n\r\nWhen some less striking figures have gone past, a new victim is\r\nprovided for the jokers. On his red and wrinkled neck luxuriates some\r\ndirty sheep\'s-wool. With knees bent, his body forward, his back bowed,\r\nthis Territorial\'s carriage is the worst.\r\n\r\n"Tiens!" bawls Tirette, with pointed finger, "the famous\r\nconcertina-man! It would cost you something to see him at the\r\nfair--here, he\'s free gratis!"\r\n\r\nThe victim stammers responsive insults amid the scattered laughter that\r\narises.\r\n\r\nNo more than that laughter is required to excite the two comrades. It\r\nis the ambition to have their jests voted funny by their easy audience\r\nthat stimulates them to mock the peculiarities of their old\r\ncomrades-in-arms, of those who toil night and day on the brink of the\r\ngreat war to make ready and make good the fields of battle.\r\n\r\nAnd even the other watchers join in. Miserable themselves, they scoff\r\nat the still more miserable.\r\n\r\n"Look at that one! And that, look!"\r\n\r\n"Non, but take me a snapshot of that little rump-end! Hey, earth-worm!"\r\n\r\n"And that one that has no ending! Talk about a sky-scratcher! Tiens,\r\nla, he takes the biscuit. Yes, you take it, old chap!"\r\n\r\nThis man goes with little steps, and holds his pickax up in front like\r\na candle; his face is withered, and his body borne down by the blows of\r\nlumbago.\r\n\r\n"Like a penny, gran\'pa?" Barque asks him, as he passes within reach of\r\na tap on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe broken-down poilu replies with a great oath of annoyance, and\r\nprovokes the harsh rejoinder of Barque: "Come now, you might be polite,\r\nfilthy-face, old muck-mill!"\r\n\r\nTurning right round in fury, the old one defies his tormentor.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" cries Barque, laughing, "He\'s showing fight; the ruin! He\'s\r\nwarlike, look you, and he might be mischievous if only he were sixty\r\nyears younger!"\r\n\r\n"And if he wasn\'t alone," wantonly adds Pepin, whose eye is in quest of\r\nother targets among the flow of new arrivals.\r\n\r\nThe hollow chest of the last straggler appears, and then his distorted\r\nback disappears.\r\n\r\nThe march past of the worn-out and trench-foul veterans comes to an end\r\namong the ironical and almost malevolent faces of these sinister\r\ntroglodytes, whom their caverns of mud but half reveal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the hours slip away, and evening begins to veil the sky and\r\ndarken the things of earth. It comes to blend itself at once with the\r\nblind fate and the ignorant dark minds of the multitude there\r\nenshrouded.\r\n\r\nThrough the twilight comes the rolling hum of tramping men, and another\r\nthrong rubs its way through.\r\n\r\n"Africans!"\r\n\r\nThey march past with faces red-brown, yellow or chestnut, their beards\r\nscanty and fine or thick and frizzled, their greatcoats\r\nyellowish-green, and their muddy helmets sporting the crescent in place\r\nof our grenade. Their eyes are like balls of ivory or onyx, that shine\r\nfrom faces like new pennies, flattened or angular. Now and again comes\r\nswaying along above the line the coal-black mask of a Senegalese\r\nsharpshooter. Behind the company goes a red flag with a green hand in\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nWe watch them in silence. These are asked no questions. They command\r\nrespect, and even a little fear.\r\n\r\nAll the same, these Africans seem jolly and in high spirits. They are\r\ngoing, of course, to the first line. That is their place, and their\r\npassing is the sign of an imminent attack. They are made for the\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n"Those and the 75 gun we can take our hats off to. They\'re everywhere\r\nsent ahead at big moments, the Moroccan Division."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t quite fit in with us. They go too fast--and there\'s no way\r\nof stopping them."\r\n\r\nSome of these diabolical images in yellow wood or bronze or ebony are\r\nserious of mien, uneasy, and taciturn. Their faces have the disquieting\r\nand secret look of the snare suddenly discovered. The others laugh with\r\na laugh that jangles like fantastic foreign instruments of music, a\r\nlaugh that bares the teeth.\r\n\r\nWe talk over the characteristics of these Africans; their ferocity in\r\nattack, their devouring passion to be in with the bayonet, their\r\npredilection for "no quarter." We recall those tales that they\r\nthemselves willingly tell, all in much the same words and with the same\r\ngestures. They raise their arms over their heads--"Kam\'rad, Kam\'rad!"\r\n"Non, pas Kam\'rad!" And in pantomime they drive a bayonet forward, at\r\nbelly-height, drawing it back then with the help of a foot.\r\n\r\nOne of the sharpshooters overhears our talk as he passes. He looks upon\r\nus, laughs abundantly in his helmeted turban, and repeats our words\r\nwith significant shakes of his head: "Pas Kam\'rad, non pas Kam\'rad,\r\nnever! Cut head off!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt they\'re a different race from us, with their tent-cloth\r\nskin," Barque confesses, though he does not know himself what "cold\r\nfeet" are. "It worries them to rest, you know; they only live for the\r\nminute when the officer puts his watch back in his pocket and says,\r\n\'Off you go!\'"\r\n\r\n"In fact, they\'re real soldiers."\r\n\r\n"We are not soldiers," says big Lamuse, "we\'re men." Though the evening\r\nhas grown darker now, that plain true saying sheds something like a\r\nglimmering light on the men who are waiting here, waiting since the\r\nmorning, waiting since months ago.\r\n\r\nThey are men, good fellows of all kinds, rudely torn away from the joy\r\nof life. Like any other men whom you take in the mass, they are\r\nignorant and of narrow outlook, full of a sound common sense--which\r\nsome-times gets off the rails--disposed to be led and to do as they are\r\nbid, enduring under hardships, long-suffering.\r\n\r\nThey are simple men further simplified, in whom the merely primitive\r\ninstincts have been accentuated by the force of circumstances--the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation, the hard-gripped hope of living through,\r\nthe joy of food, of drink, and of sleep. And at intervals they are\r\ncries and dark shudders of humanity that issue from the silence and the\r\nshadows of their great human hearts.\r\n\r\nWhen we can no longer see clearly, we hear down there the murmur of a\r\ncommand, which comes nearer and rings loud--"Second half-section!\r\nMuster!" We fall in; it is the call.\r\n\r\n"Gee up!" says the corporal. We are set in motion. In front of the\r\ntool-depot there is a halt and trampling. To each is given a spade or\r\npickax. An N.C.O. presents the handles in the gloom: "You, a spade;\r\nthere, hop it! You a spade, too; you a pick. Allons, hurry up and get\r\noff."\r\n\r\nWe leave by the communication trench at right angles to our own, and\r\nstraight ahead towards the changeful frontier, now alive and terrible.\r\n\r\nUp in the somber sky, the strong staccato panting of an invisible\r\naeroplane circles in wide descending coils and fills infinity. In\r\nfront, to right and left, everywhere, thunderclaps roll with great\r\nglimpses of short-lived light in the dark-blue sky.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1:] The popular and international name for a French soldier. Its\r\nliteral meaning is "hairy, shaggy," but the word has conveyed for over\r\na century the idea of the virility of a Samson, whose strength lay in\r\nhis locks.--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 2:] 6250 miles.\r\n\r\n[note 3:] Pourvu que les civils tiennent. In the early days of the war\r\nit was a common French saying that victory was certain--"if the\r\ncivilians hold out."--Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Return\r\n\r\n\r\nRELUCTANTLY the ashen dawn is bleaching the still dark and formless\r\nlandscape. Between the declining road on the right that falls into the\r\ngloom, and the black cloud of the Alleux Wood--where we hear the convoy\r\nteams assembling and getting under way--a field extends. We have\r\nreached it, we of the 6th Battalion, at the end of the night. We have\r\npiled arms, and now, in the center of this circle of uncertain light,\r\nour feet in the mist and mud, we stand in dark clusters (that yet are\r\nhardly blue), or as solitary phantoms; and the heads of all are turned\r\ntowards the road that comes from "down there." We are waiting for the\r\nrest of the regiment, the 5th Battalion, who were in the first line and\r\nleft the trenches after us.\r\n\r\nNoises; "There they are!" A long and shapeless mass appears in the west\r\nand comes down out of the night upon the dawning road.\r\n\r\nAt last! It is ended, the accursed shift that began at six o\'clock\r\nyesterday evening and has lasted all night, and now the last man has\r\nstepped from the last communication trench.\r\n\r\nThis time it has been an awful sojourn in the trenches. The 18th\r\ncompany was foremost and has been cut up, eighteen killed and fifty\r\nwounded--one in three less in four days. And this without attack--by\r\nbombardment alone.\r\n\r\nThis is known to us, and as the mutilated battalion approaches down\r\nthere, and we join them in trampling the muddy field and exchanging\r\nnods of recognition, we cry, "What about the 18th?" We are thinking as\r\nwe put the question, "If it goes on like this, what is to become of all\r\nof us? What will become of me?"\r\n\r\nThe 17th, the 19th, and the 20th arrive in turn and pile arms. "There\'s\r\nthe 18th!" It arrives after all the others; having held the first\r\ntrench, it has been last relieved.\r\n\r\nThe light is a little cleaner, and the world is paling. We can make\r\nout, as he comes down the road, the company\'s captain, ahead of his men\r\nand alone. He helps himself along with a stick, and walks with\r\ndifficulty, by reason of his old wound of the Marne battle that\r\nrheumatism is troubling; and there are other pangs, too. He lowers his\r\nhooded head, and might be attending a funeral. We can see that in his\r\nmind he is indeed following the dead, and his thoughts are with them.\r\n\r\nHere is the company, debouching in dire disorder, and our hearts are\r\nheavy. It is obviously shorter than the other three, in the march past\r\nof the battalion.\r\n\r\nI reach the road, and confront the descending mass of the 18th. The\r\nuniforms of these survivors are all earth-yellowed alike, so that they\r\nappear to be clad in khaki. The cloth is stiff with the ochreous mud\r\nthat has dried underneath. The skirts of their greatcoats are like\r\nlumps of wood, jumping about on the yellow crust that reaches to their\r\nknees. Their faces are drawn and blackened; dust and dirt have wrinkled\r\nthem anew; their eyes are big and fevered. And from these soldiers whom\r\nthe depths of horror have given back there rises a deafening din. They\r\ntalk all at once, and loudly; they gesticulate, they laugh and sing.\r\nYou would think, to see them, that it was a holiday crowd pouring over\r\nthe road!\r\n\r\nThese are the second section and its big sub-lieutenant, whose\r\ngreatcoat is tightened and strapped around a body as stiff as a rolled\r\numbrella. I elbow my way along the marching crowd as far as Marchal\'s\r\nsquad, the most sorely tried of all. Out of eleven comrades that they\r\nwere, and had been without a break for a year and a half, there were\r\nthree men only with Corporal Marchal.\r\n\r\nHe sees me--with a glad exclamation and a broad smile. He lets go his\r\nrifle-sling and offers me his hands, from one of which hangs his trench\r\nstick--"Eh, vieux frere, still going strong? What\'s become of you\r\nlately?"\r\n\r\nI turn my head away and say, almost under my breath, "So, old chap,\r\nit\'s happened badly."\r\n\r\nHis smile dies at once, and he is serious: "Eh, oui, old man; it can\'t\r\nbe helped; it was awful this time. Barbier is killed."\r\n\r\n"They told us--Barbier!"\r\n\r\n"Saturday night it was, at eleven o\'clock. He had the top of his back\r\ntaken away by a shell," says Marchal, "cut off like a razor. Besse got\r\na bit of shell that went clean through his belly and stomach. Barthlemy\r\nand Baubex got it in the head and neck. We passed the night skedaddling\r\nup and down the trench at full speed, to dodge the showers. And little\r\nGodefroy--did you know him?--middle of his body blown away. He was\r\nemptied of blood on the spot in an instant, like a bucket kicked over.\r\nLittle as he was, it was remarkable how much blood he had, it made a\r\nstream at least fifty meters long. Gougnard got his legs cut up by one\r\nexplosion. They picked him up not quite dead. That was at the listening\r\npost. I was there on duty with them. But when that shell fell I had\r\ngone into the trench to ask the time. I found my rifle, that I\'d left\r\nin my place, bent double, as if some one had folded it in his hands,\r\nthe barrel like a corkscrew, and half of the stock in sawdust. The\r\nsmell of fresh blood was enough to bring your heart up."\r\n\r\n"And Mondain--him, too?"\r\n\r\n"Mondain--that was the day after, yesterday in fact, in a dug-out that\r\na shell smashed in. He was lying down, and his chest was crushed. Have\r\nthey told you about Franco, who was alongside Mondain? The fall of\r\nearth broke his spine. He spoke again after they\'d got him out and set\r\nhim down. He said, with his head falling to one side, \'I\'m dying,\' and\r\nhe was gone. Vigile was with them, too; his body wasn\'t touched, but\r\nthey found him with his head completely flattened out, flat as a\r\npancake, and huge-as big as that. To see it spread out on the ground,\r\nblack and distorted, it made you think of his shadow--the shadow one\r\ngets on the ground sometimes when one walks with a lantern at night."\r\n\r\n"Vigile--only Class 1913--a child! And Mondain and Franco--such good\r\nsorts, in spite of their stripes. We\'re so many old special pals the\r\nless, mon vieux Marchal."\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Marchal. But he is swallowed up in a crowd of his friends,\r\nwho worry and catechise him. He bandies jests with them, and answers\r\ntheir raillery, and all hustle each other, and laugh.\r\n\r\nI look from face to face. They are merry, and in spite of the\r\ncontractions of weariness, and the earth-stains, they look triumphant.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean? If wine had been possible during their stay in the\r\nfirst line, I should have said, "All these men are drunk."\r\n\r\nI single out one of the survivors, who hums as he goes, and steps in\r\ntime with it flippantly, as hussars of the stage do. It is Vanderborn,\r\nthe drummer.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Vanderborn, you look pleased with yourself!" Vanderborn, who is\r\nsedate in the ordinary, cries, "It\'s not me yet, you see! Here I am!"\r\nWith a mad gesticulation he serves me a thump on the shoulder. I\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nIf these men are happy in spite of all, as they come out of hell, it is\r\nbecause they are coming out of it. They are returning, they are spared.\r\nOnce again the Death that was there has passed them over. Each company\r\nin its turn goes to the front once in six weeks. Six weeks! In both\r\ngreat and minor matters, fighting soldiers manifest the philosophy of\r\nthe child. They never look afar, either ahead or around. Their thought\r\nstrays hardly farther than from day to day. To-day, every one of those\r\nmen is confident that he will live yet a little while.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why, in spite of the weariness that weighs them down and\r\nthe new slaughter with which they are still bespattered, though each\r\nhas seen his brothers torn away from his side, in spite of all and in\r\nspite of themselves, they are celebrating the Feast of the Survivors.\r\nThe boundless glory in which they rejoice is this--they still stand\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nVolpatte and Fouillade\r\n\r\n\r\nAS we reached quarters again, some one cried: "But where\'s\r\nVolpatte?"--"And Fouillade, where\'s he?"\r\n\r\nThey had been requisitioned and taken off to the front line by the 5th\r\nBattalion. No doubt we should find them somewhere in quarters. No\r\nsuccess. Two men of the squad lost!\r\n\r\n"That\'s what comes of lending men," said the sergeant with a great\r\noath. The captain, when apprised of the loss, also cursed and swore and\r\nsaid, "I must have those men. Let them be found at once. Allez!"\r\n\r\nFarfadet and I are summoned by Corporal Bertrand from the barn where at\r\nfull length we have already immobilized ourselves, and are growing\r\ntorpid: "You must go and look for Volpatte and Fouillade."\r\n\r\nQuickly we got up, and set off with a shiver of uneasiness. Our two\r\ncomrades have been taken by the 5th and carried off to that infernal\r\nshift. Who knows where they are and what they may be by now!\r\n\r\nWe climb up the hill again. Again we begin, but in the opposite\r\ndirection, the journey done since the dawn and the night. Though we are\r\nwithout our heavy stuff, and only carry rifles and accouterments, we\r\nfeel idle, sleepy, and stiff; and the country is sad, and the sky all\r\nwisped with mist. Farfadet is soon panting. He talked a little at\r\nfirst, till fatigue enforced silence on him. He is brave enough, but\r\nfrail, and during all his prewar life, shut up in the Town Hall office\r\nwhere he scribbled since the days of his "first sacrament" between a\r\nstove and some ageing cardboard files, he hardly learned the use of his\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nJust as we emerge from the wood, slipping and floundering, to penetrate\r\nthe region of communication trenches, two faint shadows are outlined in\r\nfront. Two soldiers are coming up. We can see the protuberance of their\r\nburdens and the sharp lines of their rifles. The swaying double shape\r\nbecomes distinct--"It\'s them!"\r\n\r\nOne of the shadows has a great white head, all swathed--"One of them\'s\r\nwounded! It\'s Volpatte!"\r\n\r\nWe run up to the specters, our feet making the sounds of sinking in\r\nsponge and of sticky withdrawal, and our shaken cartridges rattle in\r\ntheir pouches. They stand still and wait for us. When we are close up,\r\n"It\'s about time!" cries Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"You\'re wounded, old chap?"--"What?" he says; the manifold bandages all\r\nround his head make him deaf, and we must shout to get through them. So\r\nwe go close and shout. Then he replies, "That\'s nothing; we\'re coming\r\nfrom the hole where the 5th Battalion put us on Thursday."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve stayed there--ever since?" yells Farfadet, whose shrill and\r\nalmost feminine voice goes easily through the quilting that protects\r\nVolpatte\'s ears.\r\n\r\n"Of course we stayed there, you blithering idiot!" says Fouillade. "You\r\ndon\'t suppose we\'d got wings to fly away with, and still less that we\r\nshould have legged it without orders?"\r\n\r\nBoth of them let themselves drop to a sitting position on the ground.\r\nVolpatte\'s head--enveloped in rags with a big knot on the top and the\r\nsame dark yellowish stains as his face--looks like a bundle of dirty\r\nlinen.\r\n\r\n"They forgot you, then, poor devils?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" cries Fouillade, "I should say they did. Four days and four\r\nnights in a shell-hole, with bullets raining down, a hole that stunk\r\nlike a cesspool."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," says Volpatte. "It wasn\'t an ordinary listening-post\r\nhole, where one comes and goes regularly. It was just a shell-hole,\r\nlike any other old shell-hole, neither more nor less. They said to us\r\non Thursday, \'Station yourselves in there and keep on firing,\' they\r\nsaid. Next day, a liaison chap of the 5th Battalion came and showed his\r\nneb: \'What the hell are you doing there?\'--\'Why, we\'re firing. They\r\ntold us to fire, so we\'re firing,\' I says. \'If they told us to do it,\r\nthere must be some reason at the back of it. We\'re wanting for them to\r\ntell us to do something else.\' The chap made tracks. He looked a bit\r\nuneasy, and suffering from the effects of being bombed. \'It\'s 22,\' he\r\nsays."\r\n\r\n"To us two," says Fouillade, "there was a loaf of bread and a bucket of\r\nwine that the 18th gave us when they planted us there, and a whole case\r\nof cartridges, my boy. We fired off the cartridges and drank the booze,\r\nbut we had sense to keep a few cartridges and a hunch of bread, though\r\nwe didn\'t keep any wine."\r\n\r\n"That\'s where we went wrong," says Volpatte, "seeing that it was a\r\nthirsty job. Say, boys, you haven\'t got any gargle?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve still nearly half a pint of wine," replies Farfadet. "Give it to\r\nhim," says Fouillade, pointing to Volpatte, "seeing that he\'s been\r\nlosing blood. I\'m only thirsty."\r\n\r\nVolpatte was shivering, and his little strapped-up eyes burned with\r\nfever in the enormous dump of rags set upon his shoulders. "That\'s\r\ngood," he says, drinking.\r\n\r\n"Ah! And then, too," he added, emptying--as politeness requires--the\r\ndrop of wine that remained at the bottom of Farfadet\'s cup, "we got two\r\nBoches. They were crawling about outside, and fell into our holes, as\r\nblindly as moles into a spring snare, those chaps did. We tied \'em up.\r\nAnd see us then--after firing for thirty-six hours, we\'d no more\r\nammunition. So we filled our magazines with the last, and waited, in\r\nfront of the parcels of Boche. The liaison chap forgot to tell his\r\npeople that we were there. You, the 6th, forgot to ask for us; the 18th\r\nforgot us, too; and as we weren\'t in a listening-post where you\'re\r\nrelieved as regular as if at H.Q., I could almost see us staying there\r\ntill the regiment came back. In the long run, it was the loafers of the\r\n204th, come to skulk about looking for fuses, that mentioned us. So\r\nthen we got the order to fall back--immediately, they said. That\r\n\'immediately\' was a good joke, and we got into harness at once. We\r\nuntied the legs of the Boches, led them off and handed them over to the\r\n204th, and here we are."\r\n\r\n"We even fished out, in passing, a sergeant who was piled up in a hole\r\nand didn\'t dare come out, seeing he was shell-shocked. We slanged him,\r\nand that set him up a bit, and he thanked us. Sergeant Sacerdote he\r\ncalled himself."\r\n\r\n"But your wound, old chap?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s my ears. Two shells, a little one and a big one, my lad--went off\r\nwhile you\'re saying it. My head came between the two bursts, as you\r\nmight say, but only just; a very close shave, and my lugs got it."\r\n\r\n"You should have seen him," says Fouillade, "it was disgusting, those\r\ntwo ears hanging down. We had two packets of bandages, and the\r\nstretcher-men fired us one in. That makes three packets he\'s got rolled\r\nround his nut."\r\n\r\n"Give us your traps, we\'re going back."\r\n\r\nFarfadet and I divide Volpatte\'s equipment between us. Fouillade,\r\nsullen with thirst and racked by stiff joints, growls, and insists\r\nobstinately on keeping his weapons and bundles.\r\n\r\nWe stroll back, finding diversion--as always--in walking without ranks.\r\nIt is so uncommon that one finds it surprising and profitable. So it is\r\na breach of liberty which soon enlivens all four of us. We are in the\r\ncountry as though for the pleasure of it.\r\n\r\n"We are pedestrians!" says Volpatte proudly. When we reach the turning\r\nat the top of the hill, he relapses upon rosy visions: "Old man, it\'s a\r\ngood wound, after all. I shall be sent back, no mistake about it."\r\n\r\nHis eyes wink and sparkle in the huge white clump that dithers on his\r\nshoulders--a clump reddish on each side, where the ears were.\r\n\r\nFrom the depth where the village lies we hear ten o\'clock strike. "To\r\nhell with the time," says Volpatte "it doesn\'t matter to me any more\r\nwhat time it is."\r\n\r\nHe becomes loquacious. It is a low fever that inspires his\r\ndissertation, and condenses it to the slow swing of our walk, in which\r\nhis step is already jaunty.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll stick a red label on my greatcoat, you\'ll see, and take me to\r\nthe rear. I shall be bossed this time by a very polite sort of chap,\r\nwho\'ll say to me, \'That\'s one side, now turn the other way--so, my poor\r\nfellow.\' Then the ambulance, and then the sick-train, with the pretty\r\nlittle ways of the Red Cross ladies all the way along, like they did to\r\nCrapelet Jules, then the base hospital. Beds with white sheets, a stove\r\nthat snores in the middle of us all, people with the special job of\r\nlooking after you, and that you watch doing it, regulation\r\nslippers--sloppy and comfortable--and a chamber-cupboard. Furniture!\r\nAnd it\'s in those big hospitals that you\'re all right for grub! I shall\r\nhave good feeds, and baths. I shall take all I can get hold of. And\r\nthere\'ll be presents--that you can enjoy without having to fight the\r\nothers for them and get yourself into a bloody mess. I shall have my\r\ntwo hands on the counterpane, and they\'ll do damn well nothing, like\r\nthings to look at--like toys, what? And under the sheets my legs\'ll be\r\nwhite-hot all the way through, and my trotters\'ll be expanding like\r\nbunches of violets."\r\n\r\nVolpatte pauses, fumbles about, and pulls out of his pocket, along with\r\nhis famous pair of Soissons scissors, something that he shows to me:\r\n"Tiens, have you seen this?"\r\n\r\nIt is a photograph of his wife and two children. He has already shown\r\nit to me many a time. I look at it and express appreciation.\r\n\r\n"I shall go on sick-leave," says Volpatte, "and while my ears are\r\nsticking themselves on again, the wife and the little ones will look at\r\nme, and I shall look at them. And while they\'re growing again like\r\nlettuces, my friends, the war, it\'ll make progress--the Russians--one\r\ndoesn\'t know, what?" He is thinking aloud, lulling himself with happy\r\nanticipations, already alone with his private festival in the midst of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n"Robber!" Feuillade shouts at him. "You\'ve too much luck, by God!"\r\n\r\nHow could we not envy him? He would be going away for one, two, or\r\nthree months; and all that time, instead of our wretched privations, he\r\nwould be transformed into a man of means!\r\n\r\n"At the beginning," says Farfadet, "it sounded comic when I heard them\r\nwish for a \'good wound.\' But all the same, and whatever can be said\r\nabout it, I understand now that it\'s the only thing a poor soldier can\r\nhope for if he isn\'t daft."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWe were drawing near to the village and passing round the wood. At its\r\ncorner, the sudden shape of a woman arose against the sportive sunbeams\r\nthat outlined her with light. Alertly erect she stood, before the\r\nfaintly violet background of the wood\'s marge and the crosshatched\r\ntrees. She was slender, her head all afire with fair hair, and in her\r\npale face we could see the night-dark caverns of great eyes. The\r\nresplendent being gazed fixedly upon us, trembling, then plunged\r\nabruptly into the undergrowth and disappeared like a torch.\r\n\r\nThe apparition and its flight so impressed Volpatte that he lost the\r\nthread of his discourse.\r\n\r\n"She\'s something like, that woman there!"\r\n\r\n"No," said Fouillade, who had misunderstood, "she\'s called Eudoxie. I\r\nknew her because I\'ve seen her before. A refugee. I don\'t know where\r\nshe comes from, but she\'s at Gamblin, in a family there."\r\n\r\n"She\'s thin and beautiful," Volpatte certified; "one would like to make\r\nher a little present--she\'s good enough to eat--tender as a chicken.\r\nAnd look at the eyes she\'s got!"\r\n\r\n"She\'s queer," says Fouillade. "You don\'t know when you\'ve got her. You\r\nsee her here, there, with her fair hair on top, then--off! Nobody\r\nabout. And you know, she doesn\'t know what danger is; marching about,\r\nsometimes, almost in the front line, and she\'s been seen knocking about\r\nin No Man\'s Land. She\'s queer."\r\n\r\n"Look! There she is again. The spook! She\'s keeping an eye on us.\r\nWhat\'s she after?"\r\n\r\nThe shadow-figure, traced in lines of light, this time adorned the\r\nother end of the spinney\'s edge.\r\n\r\n"To hell with women," Volpatte declared, whom the idea of his\r\ndeliverance has completely recaptured.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one in the squad, anyway, that wants her pretty badly.\r\nSee--when you speak of the wolf--"\r\n\r\n"You see its tail--"\r\n\r\n"Not yet, but almost--look!" From some bushes on our right we saw the\r\nred snout of Lamuse appear peeping, like a wild boar\'s.\r\n\r\nHe was on the woman\'s trail. He had seen the alluring vision, dropped\r\nto the crouch of a setting dog, and made his spring. But in that spring\r\nhe fell upon us.\r\n\r\nRecognizing Volpatte and Fouillade, big Lamuse gave shouts of delight.\r\nAt once he had no other thought than to get possession of the bags,\r\nrifles, and haversacks--"Give me all of it--I\'m resting--come on, give\r\nit up."\r\n\r\nHe must carry everything. Farfadet and I willingly gave up Volpatte\'s\r\nequipment; and Fouillade, now at the end of his strength, agreed to\r\nsurrender his pouches and his rifle.\r\n\r\nLamuse became a moving heap. Under the huge burden he disappeared, bent\r\ndouble, and made progress only with shortened steps.\r\n\r\nBut we felt that he was still under the sway of a certain project, and\r\nhis glances went sideways. He was seeking the woman after whom he had\r\nhurled himself. Every time he halted, the better to trim some detail of\r\nthe load, or puffingly to mop the greasy flow of perspiration, he\r\nfurtively surveyed all the corners of the horizon and scrutinized the\r\nedges of the wood. He did not see her again.\r\n\r\nI did see her again, and got a distinct impression this time that it\r\nwas one of us she was after. She half arose on our left from the green\r\nshadows of the undergrowth. Steadying herself with one hand on a\r\nbranch, she leaned forward and revealed the night-dark eyes and pale\r\nface, which showed--so brightly lighted was one whole side of it--like\r\na crescent moon.\r\n\r\nI saw that she was smiling. And following the course of the look that\r\nsmiled, I saw Farfadet a little way behind us, and he was smiling too.\r\nThen she slipped away into the dark foliage, carrying the twin smile\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nThus was the understanding revealed to me between this lissom and\r\ndainty gypsy, who was like no one at all, and Farfadet, conspicuous\r\namong us all--slender, pliant and sensitive as lilac. Evidently--!\r\n\r\nLamuse saw nothing, blinded and borne down as he was by the load he had\r\ntaken from Farfadet and me, occupied in the poise of them, and in\r\nfinding where his laden and leaden feet might tread.\r\n\r\nBut he looks unhappy; he groans. A weighty and mournful obsession is\r\nstifling him. In his harsh breathing it seems to me that I can hear his\r\nheart beating and muttering. Looking at Volpatte, hooded in bandages,\r\nand then at the strong man, muscular and full-blooded, with that\r\nprofound and eternal yearning whose sharpness he alone can gauge, I say\r\nto myself that the worst wounded man is not he whom we think.\r\n\r\nWe go down at last to the village. "Let\'s have a drink," says\r\nFouillade. "I\'m going to be sent back," says Volpatte. Lamuse puffs and\r\ngroans.\r\n\r\nOur comrades shout and come running, and we gather in the little square\r\nwhere the church stands with its twin towers--so thoroughly mutilated\r\nby a shell that one can no longer look it in the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSanctuary\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE dim road which rises through the middle of the night-bound wood is\r\nso strangely full of obstructing shadows that the deep darkness of the\r\nforest itself might by some magic have overflowed upon it. It is the\r\nregiment on the march, in quest of a new home.\r\n\r\nThe weighty ranks of the shadows, burdened both high and broad, hustle\r\neach other blindly. Each wave, pushed by the following, stumbles upon\r\nthe one in front, while alongside and detached are the evolutions of\r\nthose less bulky ghosts, the N.C.O.\'s. A clamor of confusion, compound\r\nof exclamations, of scraps of chat, of words of command, of spasms of\r\ncoughing and of song, goes up from the dense mob enclosed between the\r\nbanks. To the vocal commotion is added the tramping of feet, the\r\njingling of bayonets in their scabbards, of cans and drinking-cups, the\r\nrumbling and hammering of the sixty vehicles of the two\r\nconvoys--fighting and regimental--that follow the two battalions. And\r\nsuch a thing is it that trudges and spreads itself over the climbing\r\nroad that, in spite of the unbounded dome of night, one welters in the\r\nodor of a den of lions.\r\n\r\nIn the ranks one sees nothing. Sometimes, when one can lift his nose\r\nup, by grace of an eddy in the tide, one cannot help seeing the\r\nwhiteness of a mess-tin, the blue steel of a helmet, the black steel of\r\na rifle. Anon, by the dazzling jet of sparks that flies from a pocket\r\nflint-and-steel, or the red flame that expands upon the lilliputian\r\nstem of a match, one can see beyond the vivid near relief of hands and\r\nfaces to the silhouetted and disordered groups of helmeted shoulders,\r\nswaying like surges that would storm the sable stronghold of the night.\r\nThen, all goes out, and while each tramping soldier\'s legs swing to and\r\nfro, his eye is fixed inflexibly upon the conjectural situation of the\r\nback that dwells in front of him.\r\n\r\nAfter several halts, when we have allowed ourselves to collapse on our\r\nhaversacks at the foot of the stacked rifles--stacks that form on the\r\ncall of the whistle with feverish haste and exasperating delay, through\r\nour blindness in that atmosphere of ink-dawn reveals itself, extends,\r\nand acquires the domain of Space. The walls of the Shadow crumble in\r\nvague ruin. Once more we pass under the grand panorama of the day\'s\r\nunfolding upon the ever-wandering horde that we are.\r\n\r\nWe emerge at last from this night of marching, across concentric\r\ncircles as it seems, of darkness less dark, then of half-shadow, then\r\nof gloomy light. Legs have a wooden stiffness, backs are benumbed,\r\nshoulders bruised. Faces are still so gray or so black, one would say\r\nthey had but half rid themselves of the night. Now, indeed, one never\r\nthrows it off altogether.\r\n\r\nIt is into new quarters that the great company is going--this time to\r\nrest. What will the place be like that we have to live in for eight\r\ndays? It is called, they say--but nobody is certain of\r\nanything--Gauchin-l\'Abbe. We have heard wonders about it--"It appears\r\nto be just it."\r\n\r\nIn the ranks of the companies whose forms and features one begins to\r\nmake out in the birth of morning, and to distinguish the lowered heads\r\nand yawning mouths, some voices are heard in still higher praise.\r\n"There never were such quarters. The Brigade\'s there, and the\r\ncourt-martial. You can get anything in the shops."--"If the Brigade\'s\r\nthere, we\'re all right."--\r\n\r\n"Think we can find a table for the squad?"--"Everything you want, I\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\nA pessimist prophet shakes his head: "What these quarters\'ll be like\r\nwhere we\'ve never been, I don\'t know," he says. "What I do know is that\r\nit\'ll be like the others."\r\n\r\nBut we don\'t believe him, and emerging from the fevered turmoil of the\r\nnight, it seems to all that it is a sort of Promised Land we are\r\napproaching by degrees as the light brings us out of the east and the icy\r\nair towards the unknown village.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of a bill in the half-light, we reach some houses, still\r\nslumbering and wrapped in heavy grayness.\r\n\r\n"There it is!"\r\n\r\nPoof! We\'ve done twenty-eight kilometers in the night. But what of\r\nthat? There is no halt. We go past the houses, and they sink back again\r\ninto their vague vapors and their mysterious shroud.\r\n\r\n"Seems we\'ve got to march a long time yet. It\'s always there, there,\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\nWe march like machines, our limbs invaded by a sort of petrified\r\ntorpor; our joints cry aloud, and force us to make echo.\r\n\r\nDay comes slowly, for a blanket of mist covers the earth. It is so cold\r\nthat the men dare not sit down during the halts, though overborne by\r\nweariness, and they pace to and fro in the damp obscurity like ghosts.\r\nThe besom of a biting wintry wind whips our skin, sweeps away and\r\nscatters our words and our sighs.\r\n\r\nAt last the sun pierces the reek that spreads over us and soaks what it\r\ntouches, and something like a fairy glade opens out in the midst of\r\nthis gloom terrestrial. The regiment stretches itself and wakes up in\r\ntruth, with slow-lifted faces to the gilded silver of the earliest\r\nrays. Quickly, then, the sun grows fiery, and now it is too hot. In the\r\nranks we pant and sweat, and our grumbling is louder even than just\r\nnow, when our teeth were chattering and the fog wet-sponged our hands\r\nand faces.\r\n\r\nIt is a chalk country through which we are passing on this torrid\r\nforenoon--"They mend this road with lime, the dirty devils!" The road\r\nhas become blinding--a long-drawn cloud of dessicated chalk and dust\r\nthat rises high above our columns and powders us as we go. Faces turn\r\nred, and shine as though varnished; some of the full-blooded ones might\r\nbe plastered with vaseline. Cheeks and foreheads are coated with a\r\nrusty paste which agglutinates and cracks. Feet lose their dubious\r\nlikeness to feet and might have paddled in a mason\'s mortar-trough.\r\nHaversacks and rifles are powdered in white, and our legion leaves to\r\nleft and right a long milky track on the bordering grass. And to crown\r\nall--"To the right! A convoy!"\r\n\r\nWe bear to the right, hurriedly, and not without bumpings. The convoy\r\nof lorries, a long chain of foursquare and huge projectiles, rolling up\r\nwith diabolical din, hurls itself along the road. Curse it! One after\r\nanother, they gather up the thick carpet of white powder that\r\nupholsters the ground and send it broadcast over our shoulders! Now we\r\nare garbed in a stuff of light gray and our faces are pallid masks,\r\nthickest on the eyebrows and mustaches, on beards, and the cracks of\r\nwrinkles. Though still ourselves, we look like strange old men.\r\n\r\n"When we\'re old buffers, we shall be as ugly as this," says Tirette.\r\n\r\n"Tu craches blanc," declares Biquet. [note 1]\r\n\r\nWhen a halt puts us out of action, you might take us for rows of\r\nplaster statues, with some dirty indications of humanity showing\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nWe move again, silent and chagrined. Every step becomes hard to\r\ncomplete. Our faces assume congealed and fixed grimaces under the wan\r\nleprosy of dust. The unending effort contracts us and quite fills us\r\nwith dismal weariness and disgust.\r\n\r\nWe espy at last the long-sought oasis. Beyond a hill, on a still higher\r\none, some slated roofs peep from clusters of foliage as brightly green\r\nas a salad. The village is there, and our looks embrace it, but we are\r\nnot there yet. For a long time it seems to recede as fast as the\r\nregiment crawls towards it.\r\n\r\nAt long last, on the stroke of noon, we reach the quarters that had\r\nbegun to appear a pretense and a legend. In regular step and with\r\nrifles on shoulders, the regiment floods the street of Gauchin-l\'Abbe\r\nright to its edges. Most of the villages of the Pas du Calais are\r\ncomposed of a single street, but such a street! It is often several\r\nkilometers long. In this one, the street divides in front of the mairie\r\nand forms two others, so that the hamlet becomes a big Y, brokenly\r\nbordered by low-built dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe cyclists, the officers, the orderlies, break away from the long\r\nmoving mass. Then, as they come up, a few of the men at a time are\r\nswallowed up by the barns, the still available houses being reserved\r\nfor officers and departments. Our half-company is led at first to the\r\nend of the village, and then--by some misunderstanding among the\r\nquartermasters--back to the other end, the one by which we entered.\r\nThis oscillation takes up time, and the squad, dragged thus from north\r\nto south and from south to north, heavily fatigued and irritated by\r\nwasted walking, evinces feverish impatience. For it is supremely\r\nimportant to be installed and set free as early as possible if we are\r\nto carry out the plan we have cherished so long--to find a native with\r\nsome little place to let, and a table where the squad can have its\r\nmeals. We have talked a good deal about this idea and its delightful\r\nadvantages. We have taken counsel, subscribed to a common fund, and\r\ndecided that this time we will take the header into the additional\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\nBut will it be possible? Very many places are already snapped up. We\r\nare not the only ones to bring our dream of comfort here, and it will\r\nbe a race for that table. Three companies are coming in after ours, but\r\nfour were here before us, and there are the officers, the cooks of the\r\nhospital staff for the Section, and the clerks, the drivers, the\r\norderlies and others, official cooks of the sergeants\' mess, and I\r\ndon\'t know how many more. All these men are more influential than the\r\nsoldiers of the line, they have more mobility and more money, and can\r\nbring off their schemes beforehand. Already, while we march four\r\nabreast towards the barn assigned to the squad, we see some of these\r\njokers across the conquered thresholds, domestically busy.\r\n\r\nTirette imitates the sounds of lowing and bleating--"There\'s our\r\ncattle-shed." A fairly big barn. The chopped straw smells of\r\nnight-soil, and our feet stir up clouds of dust. But it is almost\r\nenclosed. We choose our places and cast off our equipment.\r\n\r\nThose who dreamed yet once again of a special sort of Paradise sing\r\nlow--yet once again. "Look now, it seems as ugly as the other\r\nplaces."--"It\'s something like the same."--"Naturally."\r\n\r\nBut there is no time to waste in talking. The thing is to get clear and\r\nbe after the others with all strength and speed. We hurry out. In spite\r\nof broken backs and aching feet, we set ourselves savagely to this last\r\neffort on which the comfort of a week depends.\r\n\r\nThe squad divides into two patrols and sets off at the double, one to\r\nleft and one to right along the street, which is already obstructed by\r\nbusy questing poilus; and all the groups see and watch each other--and\r\nhurry. In places there are collisions, jostlings, and abuse.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s begin down there at once, or our goose\'ll be cooked!" I have an\r\nimpression of a kind of fierce battle between all the soldiers, in the\r\nstreets of the village they have just occupied. "For us," says\r\nMarthereau, "war is always struggling and fighting--always, always."\r\n\r\nWe knock at door after door, we show ourselves timidly, we offer\r\nourselves like undesirable goods. A voice arises among us, "You haven\'t\r\na bit of a corner, madame, for some soldiers? We would pay."\r\n\r\n"No--you see, I\'ve got officers--under-officers, that is--you see, it\'s\r\nthe mess for the band, and the secretaries, and the gentlemen of the\r\nambulance--"\r\n\r\nVexation after vexation. We close again, one after the other, all the\r\ndoors we had half-opened, and look at each other, on the wrong side of\r\nthe threshold, with dwindling hope in our eyes.\r\n\r\n"Bon Dieu! You\'ll see that we shan\'t find anything," growls Barque.\r\n"Damn those chaps that got on the midden before us!"\r\n\r\nThe human flood reaches high-water mark everywhere. The three streets\r\nare all growing dark as each overflows into another. Some natives cross\r\nour path, old men or ill-shapen, contorted in their walk, stunted in\r\nthe face; and even young people, too, over whom hovers the mystery of\r\nsecret disorders or political connections. As for the petticoats, there\r\nare old women and many young ones--fat, with well-padded cheeks, and\r\nequal to geese in their whiteness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in an alley between two houses, I have a fleeting vision of a\r\nwoman who crossed the shadowy gap--Eudoxie! Eudoxie, the fairy woman\r\nwhom Lamuse hunted like a satyr, away back in the country, that morning\r\nwe brought back Volpatte wounded, and Fouillade, the woman I saw\r\nleaning from the spinney\'s edge and bound to Farfadet in a mutual\r\nsmile. It is she whom I just glimpsed like a gleam of sunshine in that\r\nalley. But the gleam was eclipsed by the tail of a wall, and the place\r\nthereof relapsed upon gloom. She here, already! Then she has followed\r\nour long and painful trek! She is attracted--?\r\n\r\nAnd she looks like one allured, too. Brief glimpse though it was of her\r\nface and its crown of fair hair, plainly I saw that she was serious,\r\nthoughtful, absentminded.\r\n\r\nLamuse, following close on my heels, saw nothing, and I do not tell\r\nhim. He will discover quite soon enough the bright presence of that\r\nlovely flame where he would fain cast himself bodily, though it evades\r\nhim like a Will-o\'-th\'-wisp. For the moment, besides, we are on\r\nbusiness bent. The coveted corner must be won. We resume the hunt with\r\nthe energy of despair. Barque leads us on; he has taken the matter to\r\nheart. He is trembling--you can see it in his dusty scalp. He guides\r\nus, nose to the wind. He suggests that we make an attempt on that\r\nyellow door over there. Forward!\r\n\r\nNear the yellow door, we encounter a shape down-bent. Blaire, his foot\r\non a milestone, is reducing the bulk of his boot with his knife, and\r\nplaster-like debris is falling fast. He might be engaged in sculpture.\r\n\r\n"You never had your feet so white before," jeers Barque. "Rotting\r\napart," says Blaire, "you don\'t know where it is, that special van?" He\r\ngoes on to explain: "I\'ve got to look up the dentist-van, so they can\r\ngrapple with my ivories, and strip off the old grinders that\'s left.\r\nOui, seems it\'s stationed here, the chop-caravan."\r\n\r\nHe folds up his knife, pockets it, and goes off alongside the wall,\r\npossessed by the thought of his jaw-bones\' new lease of life.\r\n\r\nOnce more we put up our beggars\' petition: "Good-day, madame; you\r\nhaven\'t got a little corner where we could feed? We would pay, of\r\ncourse, we would pay--"\r\n\r\nThrough the glass of the low window we see lifted the face of an old\r\nman--like a fish in a bowl, it looks--a face curiously flat, and lined\r\nwith parallel wrinkles, like a page of old manuscript.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve the little shed there."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no room in the shed, and when the washing\'s done there--"\r\n\r\nBarque seizes the chance. "It\'ll do very likely. May we see it?"\r\n\r\n"We do the washing there," mutters the woman, continuing to wield her\r\nbroom.\r\n\r\n"You know," says Barque, with a smile and an engaging air, "we\'re not\r\nlike those disagreeable people who get drunk and make themselves a\r\nnuisance. May we have a look?"\r\n\r\nThe woman has let her broom rest. She is thin and inconspicuous. Her\r\njacket hangs from her shoulders as from a valise. Her face is like\r\ncardboard, stiff and without expression. She looks at us and hesitates,\r\nthen grudgingly leads the way into a very dark little place, made of\r\nbeaten earth and piled with dirty linen.\r\n\r\n"It\'s splendid," cries Lamuse, in all honesty.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she a darling, the little kiddie!" says Barque, as he pats the\r\nround cheek, like painted india-rubber, of a little girl who is staring\r\nat us with her dirty little nose uplifted in the gloom. "Is she yours,\r\nmadame?"\r\n\r\n"And that one, too?" risks Marthereau, as he espies an over-ripe infant\r\non whose bladder-like cheeks are shining deposits of jam, for the\r\nensnaring of the dust in the air. He offers a half-hearted caress in\r\nthe direction of the moist and bedaubed countenance. The woman does not\r\ndeign an answer.\r\n\r\nSo there we are, trifling and grinning, like beggars whose plea still\r\nhangs fire.\r\n\r\nLamuse whispers to me, in a torment of fear and cupidity, "Let\'s hope\r\nshe\'ll catch on, the filthy old slut. It\'s grand here, and, you know,\r\neverything else is pinched!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no table," the woman says at last.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about the table," Barque exclaims. "Tenez! there, put away\r\nin that corner, the old door; that would make us a table."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to trail me about and upset all my work!" replies the\r\ncardboard woman suspiciously, and with obvious regret that she had not\r\nchased us away immediately.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, I tell you. Look, I\'ll show you. Hey, Lamuse, old cock,\r\ngive me a hand."\r\n\r\nUnder the displeased glances of the virago we place the old door on a\r\ncouple of barrels.\r\n\r\n"With a bit of a rub-down," says I, "that will be perfect."\r\n\r\n"Eh, oui, maman, a flick with a brush\'ll do us instead of tablecloth."\r\n\r\nThe woman hardly knows what to say; she watches us spitefully: "There\'s\r\nonly two stools, and how many are there of you?"\r\n\r\n"About a dozen."\r\n\r\n"A dozen. Jesus Maria!"\r\n\r\n"What does it matter? That\'ll be all right, seeing there\'s a plank\r\nhere--and that\'s a bench ready-made, eh, Lamuse?"\r\n\r\n"Course," says Lamuse.\r\n\r\n"I want that plank," says the woman. "Some soldiers that were here\r\nbefore you have tried already to take it away."\r\n\r\n"But us, we\'re not thieves," suggests Lamuse gently, so as not to\r\nirritate the creature that has our comfort at her disposal.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say you are, but soldiers, vous savez, they smash everything\r\nup. Oh, the misery of this war!"\r\n\r\n"Well then, how much\'ll it be, to hire the table, and to heat up a\r\nthing or two on the stove?"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be twenty sous a day," announces the hostess with restraint, as\r\nthough we were wringing that amount from her.\r\n\r\n"It\'s dear," says Lamuse.\r\n\r\n"It\'s what the others gave me that were here, and they were very kind,\r\ntoo, those gentlemen, and it was worth my while to cook for them. I\r\nknow it\'s not difficult for soldiers. If you think it\'s too much, it\'s\r\nno job to find other customers for this room and this table and the\r\nstove, and who wouldn\'t be in twelves. They\'re coming along all the\r\ntime, and they\'d pay still more, if I wanted. A dozen!--"\r\n\r\nLamuse hastens to add, "I said \'It\'s dear,\' but still, it\'ll do, eh,\r\nyou others?" On this downright question we record our votes.\r\n\r\n"We could do well with a drop to drink," says Lamuse. "Do you sell\r\nwine?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the woman, but added, shaking with anger, "You see, the\r\nmilitary authority forces them that\'s got wine to sell it at fifteen\r\nsous! Fifteen sous! The misery of this cursed war! One loses at it, at\r\nfifteen sous, monsieur. So I don\'t sell any wine. I\'ve got plenty for\r\nourselves. I don\'t say but sometimes, and just to oblige, I don\'t allow\r\nsome to people that one knows, people that knows what things are, but\r\nof course, messieurs, not at fifteen sous."\r\n\r\nLamuse is one of those people "that knows what things are." He grabs at\r\nhis water-bottle, which is hanging as usual on his hip. "Give me a\r\nliter of it. That\'ll be what?"\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be twenty-two sous, same as it cost me. But you know it\'s just\r\nto oblige you, because you\'re soldiers."\r\n\r\nBarque, losing patience, mutters an aside. The woman throws him a surly\r\nglance, and makes as if to hand Lamuse\'s bottle back to him. But\r\nLamuse, launched upon the hope of drinking wine at last, so that his\r\ncheeks redden as if the draught already pervaded them with its grateful\r\nhue, hastens to intervene--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid--it\'s between ourselves, la mere, we won\'t give you\r\naway."\r\n\r\nShe raves on, rigid and bitter, against the limited price on wine; and,\r\novercome by his lusty thirst, Lamuse extends the humiliation and\r\nsurrender of conscience so far as to say, "No help for it, madame! It\'s\r\na military order, so it\'s no use trying to understand it."\r\n\r\nShe leads us into the store-room. Three fat barrels occupy it in\r\nimpressive rotundity. "Is this your little private store?"\r\n\r\n"She knows her way about, the old lady," growls Barque.\r\n\r\nThe shrew turns on her heel, truculent: "Would you have me ruin myself\r\nby this miserable war? I\'ve about enough of losing money all ways at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"How?" insists Barque.\r\n\r\n"I can see you\'re not going to risk your money!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right--we only risk our skins."\r\n\r\nWe intervene, disturbed by the tone of menace for our present concern\r\nthat the conversation has assumed. But the door of the wine-cellar is\r\nshaken, and a man\'s voice comes through. "Hey, Palmyra!" it calls.\r\n\r\nThe woman hobbles away, discreetly leaving the door open. "That\'s all\r\nright--we\'ve taken root!" Lamuse says.\r\n\r\n"What dirty devils these, people are!" murmurs Barque, who finds his\r\nreception hard to stomach.\r\n\r\n"It\'s shameful and sickening," says Marthereau.\r\n\r\n"One would think it was the first time you\'d had any of it!"\r\n\r\n"And you, old gabbler," chides Barque, "that says prettily to the\r\nwine-robber, \'Can\'t be helped, it\'s a military order\'! Gad, old man,\r\nyou\'re not short of cheek!"\r\n\r\n"What else could I do or say? We should have had to go into mourning\r\nfor our table and our wine. She could make us pay forty sous for the\r\nwine, and we should have had it all the same, shouldn\'t we? Very well,\r\nthen, got to think ourselves jolly lucky. I\'ll admit I\'d no confidence,\r\nand I was afraid it was no go."\r\n\r\n"I know; it\'s the same tale everywhere and always, but all the same--"\r\n\r\n"Damn the thieving natives, ah, oui! Some of \'em must be making\r\nfortunes. Everybody can\'t go and get killed."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the gallant people of the East!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the gallant people of the North!"\r\n\r\n"Who welcome us with open arms!"\r\n\r\n"With open hands, yes--"\r\n\r\n"I tell you," Marthereau says again, "it\'s a shame and it\'s sickening."\r\n\r\n"Shut it up--there\'s the she-beast coming back." We took a turn round\r\nto quarters to announce our success, and then went shopping. When we\r\nreturned to our new dining-room, we were hustled by the preparations\r\nfor lunch. Barque had been to the rations distribution, and had\r\nmanaged, thanks to personal relations with the cook (who was a\r\nconscientious objector to fractional divisions), to secure the potatoes\r\nand meat that formed the rations for all the fifteen men of the squad.\r\nHe had bought some lard--a little lump for fourteen sous--and some one\r\nwas frying. He had also acquired some green peas in tins, four tins.\r\nMesnil Andre\'s tin of veal in jelly would be a hors-d\'oeuvre.\r\n\r\n"And not a dirty thing in all the lot!" said Lamuse, enchanted.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWe inspected the kitchen. Barque was moving cheerfully about the iron\r\nDutch oven whose hot and steaming bulk furnished all one side of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve added a stewpan on the quiet for the soup," he whispered to me.\r\nLifting the lid of the stove--"Fire isn\'t too hot. It\'s half an hour\r\nsince I chucked the meat in, and the water\'s clean yet."\r\n\r\nA minute later we heard some one arguing with the hostess. This extra\r\nstove was the matter in dispute. There was no more room left for her on\r\nher stove. They had told her they would only need a casserole, and she\r\nhad believed them. If she had known they were going to make trouble she\r\nwould not have let the room to them. Barque, the good fellow, replied\r\njokingly, and succeeded in soothing the monster.\r\n\r\nOne by one the others arrived. They winked and rubbed their hands\r\ntogether, full of toothsome anticipation, like the guests at a\r\nwedding-breakfast. As they break away from the dazzling light outside\r\nand penetrate this cube of darkness, they are blinded, and stand like\r\nbewildered owls for several minutes.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not too brilliant in here," says Mesnil Joseph. "Come, old chap,\r\nwhat do you want?" The others exclaim in chorus, "We\'re damned well off\r\nhere." And I can see heads nodding assent in the cavern\'s twilight.\r\n\r\nAn incident: Farfadet having by accident rubbed against the damp and\r\ndirty wall, his shoulder has brought away from it a smudge so big and\r\nblack that it can be seen even here. Farfadet, so careful of his\r\nappearance, growls, and in avoiding a second contact with the wall,\r\nknocks the table so that his spoon drops to the ground. Stooping, he\r\nfumbles among the loose earth, where dust and spiders\' webs for years\r\nhave silently fallen. When he recovers his spoon it is almost black,\r\nand webby threads hang from it. Evidently it is disastrous to let\r\nanything fall on the ground. One must live here with great care.\r\n\r\nLamuse brings down his fat hand, like a pork-pie, between two of the\r\nplaces at table. "Allons, a table!" We fall to. The meal is abundant\r\nand of excellent quality. The sound of conversation mingles with those\r\nof emptying bottles and filling jaws. While we taste the joy of eating\r\nat a table, a glimmer of light trickles through a vent-hole, and wraps\r\nin dusty dawn a piece of the atmosphere and a patch of the table, while\r\nits reflex lights up a plate, a cap\'s peak, an eye. Secretly I take\r\nstock of this gloomy little celebration that overflows with gayety.\r\nBiquet is telling about his suppliant sorrows in quest of a washerwoman\r\nwho would agree to do him the good turn of washing some linen, but "it\r\nwas too damned dear." Tulacque describes the queue outside the\r\ngrocer\'s. One might not go in; customers were herded outside, like\r\nsheep. "And although you were outside, if you weren\'t satisfied, and\r\ngroused too much, they chased you off."\r\n\r\nAny news yet? It is said that severe penalties have been imposed on\r\nthose who plunder the population, and there is already a list of\r\nconvictions. Volpatte has been sent down. Men of Class \'93 are going to\r\nbe sent to the rear, and Pepere is one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen Barque brings in the harvest of the fry-pan, he announces that our\r\nhostess has soldiers at her table--ambulance men of the machine-guns.\r\n"They thought they were the best off, but it\'s us that\'s that," says\r\nFouillade with decision, lolling grandly in the darkness of the narrow\r\nand tainted hole where we are just as confusedly heaped together as in\r\na dug-out. But who would think of making the comparison?\r\n\r\n"Vous savez pas," says Pepin, "the chaps of the 9th, they\'re in clover!\r\nAn old woman has taken them in for nothing, because of her old man\r\nthat\'s been dead fifty years and was a rifleman once on a time. Seems\r\nshe\'s even given them a rabbit for nix, and they\'re just worrying it\r\njugged."\r\n\r\n"There\'s good sorts everywhere. But the boys of the 9th had famous luck\r\nto fall into the only shop of good sorts in the whole village."\r\n\r\nPalmyra comes with the coffee, which she supplies. She thaws a little,\r\nlistens to us, and even asks questions in a supercilious way: "Why do\r\nyou call the adjutant \'le juteux\'?"\r\n\r\nBarque replies sententiously, "\'Twas ever thus."\r\n\r\nWhen she has disappeared, we criticize our coffee. "Talk about clear!\r\nYou can see the sugar ambling round the bottom of the glass."--"She\r\ncharges six sous for it."--"It\'s filtered water."\r\n\r\nThe door half opens, and admits a streak of light. The face of a little\r\nboy is defined in it. We entice him in like a kitten and give him a bit\r\nof chocolate.\r\n\r\nThen, "My name\'s Charlie," chirps the child. "Our house, that\'s close\r\nby. We\'ve got soldiers, too. We always had them, we had. We sell them\r\neverything they want. Only, voila, sometimes they get drunk."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, little one, come here a bit," says Cocon, taking the boy\r\nbetween his knees. "Listen now. Your papa, he says, doesn\'t he, \'Let\'s\r\nhope the war goes on,\' eh?" [note 2]\r\n\r\n"Of course," says the child, tossing his head, "because we\'re getting\r\nrich. He says, by the end of May, we shall have got fifty thousand\r\nfrancs."\r\n\r\n"Fifty thousand francs! Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" the child insists, stamping, "he said it to mamma. Papa\r\nwished it could be always like that. Mamma, sometimes, she isn\'t sure,\r\nbecause my brother Adolphe is at the front. But we\'re going to get him\r\nsent to the rear, and then the war can go on."\r\n\r\nThese confidences are disturbed by sharp cries, coming from the rooms\r\nof our hosts. Biquet the mobile goes to inquire. "It\'s nothing," says\r\nhe, coming back; "it\'s the good man slanging the woman because she\r\ndoesn\'t know how to do things, he says, because she\'s made the mustard\r\nin a tumbler, and he never heard of such a thing, he says."\r\n\r\nWe get up, and leave the strong odor of pipes, wine, and stale coffee\r\nin our cave. As soon as we have crossed the threshold, a heaviness of\r\nheat puffs in our faces, fortified by the mustiness of frying that\r\ndwells in the kitchen and emerges every time the door is opened. We\r\npass through legions of flies which, massed on the walls in black\r\nhordes, fly abroad in buzzing swarms as we pass: "It\'s beginning again\r\nlike last year! Flies outside, lice inside.--"\r\n\r\n"And microbes still farther inside!"\r\n\r\nIn a corner of this dirty little house and its litter of old rubbish,\r\nits dusty debris of last year and the relics of so many summers gone\r\nby, among the furniture and household gear, something is moving. It is\r\nan old simpleton with a long bald neck, pink and rough, making you\r\nthink of a fowl\'s neck which has prematurely molted through disease.\r\nHis profile is that of a hen, too--no chin and a long nose. A gray\r\noverlay of beard felts his receded cheek, and you see his heavy\r\neyelids, rounded and horny, move up and down like shutters on the dull\r\nbeads of his eyes.\r\n\r\nBarque has already noticed him: "Watch him--he\'s a treasure-seeker. He\r\nsays there\'s one somewhere in this hovel that he\'s stepfather to.\r\nYou\'ll see him directly go on all-fours and push his old phizog in\r\nevery corner there is. Tiens, watch him."\r\n\r\nWith the aid of his stick, the old man proceeded to take methodical\r\nsoundings. He tapped along the foot of the walls and on the\r\nfloor-tiles.. He was hustled by the coming and going of the occupants\r\nof the house, by callers, and by the swing of Palmyra\'s broom; but she\r\nlet him alone and said nothing, thinking to herself, no doubt, that the\r\nexploitation of the national calamity is a more profitable treasure\r\nthan problematical caskets.\r\n\r\nTwo gossips are standing in a recess and exchanging confidences in low\r\nvoices, hard by an old map of Russia that is peopled with flies. "Oui,\r\nbut it\'s with the Picon bitters that you\'ve got to be careful. If you\r\nhaven\'t got a light touch, you can\'t get your sixteen glasses out of a\r\nbottle, and so you lose too much profit. I don\'t say but what one\'s all\r\nright in one\'s purse, even so, but one doesn\'t make enough. To guard\r\nagainst that, the retailers ought to agree among themselves, but the\r\nunderstanding\'s so difficult to bring off, even when it\'s in the\r\ngeneral interest."\r\n\r\nOutside there is torrid sunshine, riddled with flies. The little\r\nbeasts, quite scarce but a few days ago, multiply everywhere the murmur\r\nof their minute and innumerable engines. I go out in the company of\r\nLamuse; we are going for a saunter. One can be at peace today--it is\r\ncomplete rest, by reason of the overnight march. We might sleep, but it\r\nsuits us much better to use the rest for an extensive promenade.\r\nTo-morrow, the exercise and fatigues will get us again. There are some,\r\nless lucky than we, who are already caught in the cogwheels of fatigue.\r\nTo Lamuse, who invites him to come and stroll with us, Corvisart\r\nreplies, screwing up the little round nose that is laid flatly on his\r\noblong face like a cork, "Can\'t--I\'m on manure!" He points to the\r\nshovel and broom by whose help he is performing his task of scavenger\r\nand night-soil man.\r\n\r\nWe walk languidly. The afternoon lies heavy on the drowsy land and on\r\nstomachs richly provided and embellished with food. The remarks we\r\nexchange are infrequent.\r\n\r\nOver there, we hear noises. Barque has fallen a victim to a menagerie\r\nof housewives; and the scene is pointed by a pale little girl, her hair\r\ntied behind in a pencil of tow and her mouth embroidered with fever\r\nspots, and by women who are busy with some unsavory job of washing in\r\nthe meager shade before their doors.\r\n\r\nSix men go by, led by a quartermaster corporal. They carry heaps of new\r\ngreatcoats and bundles of boots. Lamuse regards his bloated and horny\r\nfeet--"I must have some new sheds, and no mistake; a bit more and\r\nyou\'ll see my splay-feet through these ones. Can\'t go marching on the\r\nskin of my tongs, eh?"\r\n\r\nAn aeroplane booms overhead. We follow its evolutions with our faces\r\nskyward, our necks twisted, our eyes watering at the piercing\r\nbrightness of the sky.\r\n\r\nLamuse declares to me, when we have brought our gaze back to earth,\r\n"Those machines\'ll never become practical, never."\r\n\r\n"How can you say that? Look at the progress they\'ve made already, and\r\nthe speed of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but they\'ll stop there. They\'ll never do any better, never."\r\n\r\nThis time I do not challenge the dull and obstinate denial that\r\nignorance opposes to the promise of progress, and I let my big comrade\r\nalone in his stubborn belief that the wonderful effort of science and\r\nindustry has been suddenly cut short.\r\n\r\nHaving thus begun to reveal to me his inmost thoughts, Lamuse\r\ncontinues. Coming nearer and lowering his head, he says to me, "You\r\nknow she\'s here--Eudoxie?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said I.\r\n\r\n"Yes, old chap. You never notice anything, you don\'t, but I noticed,"\r\nand Lamuse smiles at me indulgently. "Now, do you catch on? If she\'s\r\ncome here, it\'s because we interest her, eh? She\'s followed us for one\r\nof us, and don\'t you forget it."\r\n\r\nHe gets going again. "My boy, d\'you want to know what I say? She\'s come\r\nafter me."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure of it, old chap?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," says the ox-man, in a hollow voice. "First, I want her. Then,\r\ntwice, old man, I\'ve found her exactly in my path, in mine, d\'you\r\nunderstand? You may tell me that she ran away; that\'s because she\'s\r\ntimid, that, yes--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped dead in the middle of the street and looked straight at me.\r\nThe heavy face, greasily moist on the cheeks and nose, was serious. His\r\nrotund fist went up to the dark yellow mustache, so carefully pointed,\r\nand smoothed it tenderly. Then he continued to lay bare his heart to me\r\n"I want her; but, you know, I shall marry her all right, I shall. She\'s\r\ncalled Eudoxie Dumail. At first, I wasn\'t thinking of marrying her. But\r\nsince I\'ve got to know her family name, it seems to me that it\'s\r\ndifferent, and I should get on all right. Ah, nom de Dieu! She\'s so\r\npretty, that woman! And it\'s not only that she\'s pretty--ah!"\r\n\r\nThe huge child was overflowing with sentiment and emotion, and trying\r\nto make them speak to me. "Ah, my boy, there are times when I\'ve just\r\ngot to hold myself back with a hook," came the strained and gloomy\r\ntones, while the blood flushed to the fleshy parts of his cheeks and\r\nneck. "She\'s so beautiful, she\'s--and me I\'m--she\'s so unlike--you\'ll\r\nhave noticed it, surely, you that notices--she\'s a country girl, oui;\r\neh bien, she\'s got a God knows what that\'s better than a Parisienne,\r\neven a toffed-up and stylish Parisienne, pas? She--as for me, I--"\r\n\r\nHe puckered his red eyebrows. He would have liked to tell me all the\r\nsplendor of his thoughts, but he knew not the art of expressing\r\nhimself, so he was silent. He remained alone in his voiceless emotion,\r\nas always alone.\r\n\r\nWe went forward side by side between the rows of houses. In front of\r\nthe doors, drays laden with casks were drawn up. The front windows\r\nblossomed with many-hued heaps of jam-pots, stacks of tinder\r\npipe-lighters--everything that the soldier is compelled to buy. Nearly\r\nall the natives had gone into grocery. Business had been getting out of\r\ngear locally for a long time, but now it was booming. Every one,\r\nsmitten with the fever of sum-totals and dazzled by the multiplication\r\ntable, plunged into trade.\r\n\r\nBells tolled, and the procession of a military funeral came out. A\r\nforage wagon, driven by a transport man, carried a coffin wrapped in a\r\nflag. Following, were a detachment of men, an adjutant, a padre, and a\r\ncivilian.\r\n\r\n"The poor little funeral with its tail lopped off!" said Lamuse. "Ah,\r\nthose that are dead are very happy. But only sometimes, not\r\nalways--voila!"\r\n\r\nWe have passed the last of the houses. In the country, beyond the end\r\nof the street, the fighting convoy and the regimental convoy have\r\nsettled themselves, the traveling kitchens and jingling carts that\r\nfollow them with odds and ends of equipment, the Red Cross wagons, the\r\nmotor lorries, the forage carts, the baggage-master\'s gig. The tents of\r\ndrivers and conductors swarm around the vehicles. On the open spaces\r\nhorses lift their metallic eyes to the sky\'s emptiness, with their feet\r\non barren earth. Four poilus are setting up a table. The open-air\r\nsmithy is smoking. This heterogeneous and swarming city, planted in\r\nruined fields whose straight or winding ruts are stiffening in the\r\nheat, is already broadly valanced with rubbish and dung.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the camp a big, white-painted van stands out from the\r\nothers in its tidy cleanliness. Had it been in the middle of a fair,\r\none would have said it was the stylish show where one pays more than at\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nThis is the celebrated "stomatological" van that Blaire was asking\r\nabout. In point of fact, Blaire is there in front, looking at it. For\r\nsome long time, no doubt, he has been going round it and gazing.\r\nField-hospital orderly Sambremeuse, of the Division, returning from\r\nerrands, is climbing the portable stair of painted wood which leads to\r\nthe van door. In his arms he carries a bulky box of biscuits, a loaf of\r\nfancy bread, and a bottle of champagne. Blaire questions him--"Tell me,\r\nSir Rump, this horse-box--is it the dentist\'s?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s written up there," replies Sambremeuse--a little corpulent man,\r\nclean, close-shaven, and his chin starch-white. "If you can\'t see it,\r\nyou don\'t want the dentist to look after your grinders, you want the\r\nvet to clean your eyesight."\r\n\r\nBlaire comes nearer and scrutinizes the establishment. "It\'s a queer\r\nshop," he says. He goes nearer yet, draws back, hesitates to risk his\r\ngums in that carriage. At last he decides, puts a foot on the stair,\r\nand disappears inside the caravan.\r\n\r\nWe continue our walk, and turn into a footpath where are high, dusty\r\nbushes and the noises are subdued. The sunshine blazes everywhere; it\r\nheats and roasts the hollow of the way, spreading blinding and burning\r\nwhiteness in patches, and shimmers in the sky of faultless blue.\r\n\r\nAt the first turning, almost before we had heard the light grating of a\r\nfootstep, we are face to face with Eudoxie!\r\n\r\nLamuse utters a deep exclamation. Perhaps he fancies once more that she\r\nis looking for him, and believes that she is the gift of his destiny.\r\nHe goes up to her--all the bulk of him.\r\n\r\nShe looks at him and stops, framed by the hawthorn. Her strangely\r\nslight and pale face is apprehensive, the lids tremble on her\r\nmagnificent eyes. She is bareheaded, and in the hollowed neck of her\r\nlinen corsage there is the dawning of her flesh. So near, she is truly\r\nenticing in the sunshine, this woman crowned with gold, and one\'s\r\nglance is impelled and astonished by the moon-like purity of her skin.\r\nHer eyes sparkle; her teeth, too, glisten white in the living wound of\r\nher half-open mouth, red as her heart.\r\n\r\n"Tell me--I am going to tell you," pants Lamuse. "I like you so much--"\r\nHe outstretches his arm towards the motionless, beloved wayfarer.\r\n\r\nShe starts, and replies to him, "Leave me alone--you disgust me!"\r\n\r\nThe man\'s hand is thrown over one of her little ones. She tries to draw\r\nit back, and shakes it to free herself. Her intensely fair hair falls\r\nloose, flaming. He draws her to him. His head bends towards her, and\r\nhis lips are ready. His desire--the wish of all his strength and all\r\nhis life--is to caress her. He would die that he might touch her with\r\nhis lips. But she struggles, and utters a choking cry. She is\r\ntrembling, and her beautiful face is disfigured with abhorrence.\r\n\r\nI go up and put my hand on my friend\'s shoulder, but my intervention is\r\nnot needed. Lamuse recoils and growls, vanquished.\r\n\r\n"Are you taken that way often?" cries Eudoxie.\r\n\r\n"No!" groans the miserable man, baffled, overwhelmed, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do it again, vous savez!" she says, and goes off panting, and he\r\ndoes not even watch her go. He stands with his arms hanging, gazing at\r\nthe place whence she has gone, tormented to the quick, torn from his\r\ndreams of her, and nothing left him to desire.\r\n\r\nI lead him away and he comes in dumb agitation, sniffling and out of\r\nbreath, as though he had run a long way. The mass of his big head is\r\nbent. In the pitiless light of eternal spring, he is like the poor\r\nCyclops who roamed the shores of ancient Sicily in the beginnings of\r\ntime--like a huge toy, a thing of derision, that a child\'s shining\r\nstrength could subdue.\r\n\r\nThe itinerant wine-seller, whose barrow is hunchbacked with a barrel,\r\nhas sold several liters to the men on guard duty. He disappears round\r\nthe bend in the road, with his face flat and yellow as a Camembert, his\r\nscanty, thin hair frayed into dusty flakes, and so emaciated himself\r\nthat one could fancy his feet were fastened to his trunk by strings\r\nthrough his flopping trousers.\r\n\r\nAnd among the idle poilus of the guard-room at the end of the place,\r\nunder the wing of the shaking and rattling signboard which serves as\r\nadvertisement of the village, [note 3] a conversation is set up on the\r\nsubject of this wandering buffoon.\r\n\r\n"He has a dirty neb," says Bigornot; "and I\'ll tell you what I\r\nthink--they\'ve no business to let civvies mess about at the front with\r\ntheir pretty ringlets, and especially individuals that you don\'t know\r\nwhere they come from."\r\n\r\n"You\'re quite crushing, you portable louse," replies Cornet.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, shoe-sole face," Bigornot insists; "we trust \'em too much.\r\nI know what I\'m saying when I open it."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t," says Canard. "Pepere\'s going to the rear."\r\n\r\n"The women here," murmurs La Mollette, "they\'re ugly; they\'re a lot of\r\nfrights."\r\n\r\nThe other men on guard, their concentrated gaze roaming in space, watch\r\ntwo enemy aeroplanes and the intricate skeins they are spinning. Around\r\nthe stiff mechanical birds up there that appear now black like crows\r\nand now white like gulls, according to the play of the light, clouds of\r\nbursting shrapnel stipple the azure, and seem like a long flight of\r\nsnowflakes in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nAs we are going back, two strollers come up--Carassus and Cheyssier.\r\nThey announce that mess-man Pepere is going to the rear, to be sent to\r\na Territorial regiment, having come under the operation of the Dalbiez\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a hint for Blaire," says Carassus, who has a funny big nose in\r\nthe middle of his face that suits him ill.\r\n\r\nIn the village groups of poilus go by, or in twos, joined by the\r\ncrossing bonds of converse. We see the solitary ones unite in couples,\r\nseparate, then come together again with a new inspiration of talk,\r\ndrawn to each other as if magnetized.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of an excited crowd white papers are waving. It is the\r\nnewspaper hawker, who is selling for two sous papers which should be\r\none sou. Fouillade is standing in the middle of the road, thin as the\r\nlegs of a hare. At the corner of a house Paradis shows to the sun face\r\npink as ham.\r\n\r\nBiquet joins us again, in undress, with a jacket and cap of the police.\r\nHe is licking his chops: "I met some pals and we\'ve had a drink. You\r\nsee, to-morrow one starts scratching again, and cleaning his old rags\r\nand his catapult. But my greatcoat!--going to be some job to filter\r\nthat! It isn\'t a greatcoat any longer--it\'s armor-plate."\r\n\r\nMontreuil, a clerk at the office, appears and hails Biquet: "Hey,\r\nriff-raff! A letter! Been chasing you an hour. You\'re never to be\r\nfound, rotter!"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t be both here and there, looney. Give us a squint." He examines\r\nthe letter, balances it in his hand, and announces as he tears the\r\nenvelope, "It\'s from the old woman."\r\n\r\nWe slacken our pace. As he reads, he follows the lines with his finger,\r\nwagging his head with an air of conviction, and his lips moving like a\r\nwoman\'s in prayer.\r\n\r\nThe throng increases the nearer we draw to the middle of the village.\r\nWe salute the commandant and the black-skirted padre who walks by the\r\nother\'s side like his nurse. We are questioned by Pigeon, Guenon, young\r\nEscutenaire, and Chasseur Clodore. Lamuse appears blind and deaf, and\r\nconcerned only to walk.\r\n\r\nBizouarne, Chanrion, and Roquette arrive excitedly to announce big\r\nnews--"D\'you know, Pepere\'s going to the rear."\r\n\r\n"Funny," says Biquet, raising his nose from his letter, "how people kid\r\nthemselves. The old woman\'s bothered about me!" He shows me a passage\r\nin the maternal epistle: "\'When you get my letter,\'" he spells out,\r\n"\'no doubt you will be in the cold and mud, deprived of everything, mon\r\npauvre Eugene\'" He laughs: "It\'s ten days since she put that down for\r\nme, and she\'s clean off it. We\'re not cold, \'cos it\'s been fine since\r\nthis morning; and we\'re not miserable, because we\'ve got a room that\'s\r\ngood enough. We\'ve had hard times, but we\'re all right now."\r\n\r\nAs we reach the kennel in which we are lodgers, we are thinking that\r\nsentence over. Its touching simplicity affects me, shows me a soul--a\r\nhost of souls. Because the sun has shown himself, because we have felt\r\na gleam and a similitude of comfort, suffering exists no longer, either\r\nof the past or the terrible future. "We\'re all right now." There is no\r\nmore to say.\r\n\r\nBiquet establishes himself at the table, like a gentleman, to write a\r\nreply. Carefully he lays abroad his pen ink, and paper, and examines\r\neach, then smilingly traces the strictly regular lines of his big\r\nhandwriting across the meager page.\r\n\r\n"You\'d laugh," he says, "if you knew what I\'ve written to the old\r\nwoman." He reads his letter again, fondles it, and smiles to himself.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1:] Pity to spoil this jest by translation, but Biquet\'s primary\r\nmeaning was "You\'re cross because you\'ve a throat like a lime-kiln."\r\nHis secondary or literal meaning is obvious.--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 2:] See p. 34 ante; [chapter 5, note 3] another reference to the\r\nfamous phrase. "Pourvu que les civils tiennent."--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 3:] Every French village has a plaque attached to the first house\r\non each road of approach, giving its name and the distance to the\r\nnext.--Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nHabits\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are enthroned in the back yard. The big hen, white as a cream\r\ncheese, is brooding in the depths of a basket near the coop whose\r\nimprisoned occupant is rummaging about. But the black hen is free to\r\ntravel. She erects and withdraws her elastic neck in jerks, and\r\nadvances with a large and affected gait. One can just see her profile\r\nand its twinkling spangle, and her talk appears to proceed from a metal\r\nspring. She marches, glistening black and glossy like the love-locks of\r\na gypsy; and as she marches, she unfolds here and there upon the ground\r\na faint trail of chickens.\r\n\r\nThese trifling little yellow balls, kept always by a whispering\r\ninstinct on the ebb-tide to safety, hurry along under the maternal\r\nmarch in short, sharp jerks, pecking as they go. Now the train comes to\r\na full stop, for two of the chickens are thoughtful and immobile,\r\ncareless of the parental clucking.\r\n\r\n"A bad sign," says Paradis; "the hen that reflects is ill." And Paradis\r\nuncrosses and recrosses his legs. Beside him on the bench, Blaire\r\nextends his own, lets loose a great yawn that he maintains in placid\r\nduration, and sets himself again to observe, for of all of us he most\r\ndelights in watching fowls during the brief life when they are in such\r\na hurry to eat.\r\n\r\nAnd we watch them in unison, not forgetting the shabby old cock, worn\r\nthreadbare. Where his feathers have fallen appears the naked\r\nindia-rubber leg, lurid as a grilled cutlet. He approaches the white\r\nsitter, which first turns her head away in tart denial, with several\r\n"No\'s" in a muffled rattle, and then watches him with the little blue\r\nenamel dials of her eyes.\r\n\r\n"We\'re all right," says Barque.\r\n\r\n"Watch the little ducks," says Blaire, "going along the communication\r\ntrench."\r\n\r\nWe watch a single file of all-golden ducklings go past--still almost\r\neggs on feet--their big heads pulling their little lame bodies along by\r\nthe string of their necks, and that quickly. From his corner, the big\r\ndog follows them also with his deeply dark eye, on which the slanting\r\nsun has shaped a fine tawny ring.\r\n\r\nBeyond this rustic yard and over the scalloping of the low wall, the\r\norchard reveals itself, where a green carpet, moist and thick, covers\r\nthe rich soil and is topped by a screen of foliage with a garniture of\r\nblossom, some white as statuary, others pied and glossy as knots in\r\nneckties. Beyond again is the meadow, where the shadowed poplars throw\r\nshafts of dark or golden green. Still farther again is a square patch\r\nof upstanding hops, followed by a patch of cabbages, sitting on the\r\nground and dressed in line. In the sunshine of air and of earth we hear\r\nthe bees, as they work and make music (in deference to the poets), and\r\nthe cricket which, in defiance of the fable, sings with no humility and\r\nfills Space by himself.\r\n\r\nOver yonder, there falls eddying from a poplar\'s peak a magpie--half\r\nwhite, half black, like a shred of partly-burned paper.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers outstretch themselves luxuriously on the stone bench,\r\ntheir eyes half closed, and bask in the sunshine that warms the basin\r\nof the big yard till it is like a bath.\r\n\r\n"That\'s seventeen days we\'ve been here! After thinking we were going\r\naway day after day!"\r\n\r\n"One never knows," said Paradis, wagging his head and smacking his lips.\r\n\r\nThrough the yard gate that opens on to the road we see a group of\r\npoilus strolling, nose in air, devouring the sunshine; and then, all\r\nalone, Tellurure. In the middle of the street he oscillates the\r\nprosperous abdomen of which he is proprietor, and rocking on legs\r\narched like basket-handles, he expectorates in wide abundance all\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n"We thought, too, that we should be as badly off here as in the other\r\nquarters. But this time it\'s real rest, both in the time it lasts and\r\nthe kind it is."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not given too many exercises and fatigues."\r\n\r\n"And between whiles you come in here to loll about."\r\n\r\nThe old man huddled up at the end of the seat--no other than the\r\ntreasure-seeking grandfather whom we saw the day of our arrival--came\r\nnearer and lifted his finger. "When I was a young man, I was thought a\r\nlot of by women," he asserted, shaking his head. "I have led young\r\nladies astray!"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said we, heedless, our attention taken away from his senile\r\nprattle by the timely noise of a cart that was passing, laden and\r\nlaboring.\r\n\r\n"Nowadays," the old man went on, "I only think about money."\r\n\r\n"Ah, oui, the treasure you\'re looking for, papa."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it," said the old rustic, though he felt the skepticism around\r\nhim. He tapped his cranium with his forefinger, which he then extended\r\ntowards the house. "Take that insect there," he said, indicating a\r\nlittle beast that ran along the plaster. "What does it say? It says, \'I\r\nam the spider that spins the Virgin\'s thread.\'" And the archaic\r\nsimpleton added, "One must never judge what people do, for one can\r\nnever tell what may happen."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," replied Paradis politely. "He\'s funny," said Mesnil\r\nAndre, between his teeth, while he sought the mirror in his pocket to\r\nlook at the facial benefit of fine weather. "He\'s crazy," murmured\r\nBarque in his ecstasy.\r\n\r\n"I leave you," said the old man, yielding in annoyance.\r\n\r\nHe got up to go and look for his treasure again, entered the house that\r\nsupported our backs, and left the door open, where beside the huge\r\nfireplace in the room we saw a little girl, so seriously playing with a\r\ndoll that Blaire fell considering, and said, "She\'s right."\r\n\r\nThe games of children are a momentous preoccupation. Only the grown-ups\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nAfter we have watched the animals and the strollers go by, we watch the\r\ntime go by, we watch everything.\r\n\r\nWe are seeing the life of things, we are present with Nature, blended\r\nwith climates, mingled even with the sky, colored by the seasons. We\r\nhave attached ourselves to this corner of the land where chance has\r\nheld us back from our endless wanderings in longer and deeper peace\r\nthan elsewhere; and this closer intercourse makes us sensible of all\r\nits traits and habits. September--the morrow of August and eve of\r\nOctober, most affecting of months--is already sprinkling the fine days\r\nwith subtle warnings. Already one knows the meaning of the dead leaves\r\nthat flit about the flat stones like a flock of sparrows.\r\n\r\nIn truth we have got used to each other\'s company, we and this place.\r\nSo often transplanted, we are taking root here, and we no longer\r\nactually think of going away, even when we talk about it.\r\n\r\n"The 11th Division jolly well stayed a month and a half resting," says\r\nBlaire.\r\n\r\n"And the 375th, too, nine weeks!" replies Barque, in a tone of\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n"I think we shall stay here at least as long--at least, I say."\r\n\r\n"We could finish the war here all right."\r\n\r\nBarque is affected by the words, nor very far from believing them.\r\n"After all, it will finish some day, what!"\r\n\r\n"After all!" repeat the others.\r\n\r\n"To be sure, one never knows," says Paradis. He says this weakly,\r\nwithout deep conviction. It is, however, a saying which leaves no room\r\nfor reply. We say it over again, softly, lulling ourselves with it as\r\nwith an old song.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nFarfadet rejoined us a moment ago. He took his place near us, but a\r\nlittle withdrawn all the same, and sits on an overturned tub, his chin\r\non his fists.\r\n\r\nThis man is more solidly happy than we are. We know it well, and he\r\nknows it well. Lifting his head he has looked in turn, with the same\r\ndistant gaze, at the back of the old man who went to seek his treasure,\r\nand at the group that talks of going away no more. There shines over\r\nour sensitive and sentimental comrade a sort of personal glamour, which\r\nmakes of him a being apart, which gilds him and isolates him from us,\r\nin spite of himself, as though an officer\'s tabs had fallen on him from\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nHis idyll with Eudoxie has continued here. We have had the proofs; and\r\nonce, indeed, he spoke of it. She is not very far away, and they are\r\nvery near to each other. Did I not see her the other evening, passing\r\nalong the wall of the parsonage, her hair but half quenched by a\r\nmantilla, as she went obviously to a rendezvous? Did I not see that she\r\nbegan to hurry and to lean forward, already smiling? Although there is\r\nno more between them yet than promises and assurances, she is his, and\r\nhe is the man who will hold her in his arms.\r\n\r\nThen, too, he is going to leave us, called to the rear, to Brigade\r\nH.Q., where they want a weakling who can work a typewriter. It is\r\nofficial; it is in writing; he is saved. That gloomy future at which we\r\nothers dare not look is definite and bright for him.\r\n\r\nHe looks at an open window and the dark gap behind it of some room or\r\nother over there, a shadowy room that bemuses him. His life is twofold\r\nin hope; he is happy, for the imminent happiness that does not yet\r\nexist is the only real happiness down here.\r\n\r\nSo a scanty spirit of envy grows around him. "One never knows," murmurs\r\nParadis again, but with no more confidence than when before, in the\r\nstraitened scene of our life to-day, he uttered those immeasurable\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nEntraining\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day, Barque began to address us, and said: "I\'ll just explain\r\nto you what it is. There are some i--"\r\n\r\nA ferocious whistle cut his explanation off short, on the syllable. We\r\nwere in a railway station, on a platform. A night alarm had torn us\r\nfrom our sleep in the village and we had marched here. The rest was\r\nover; our sector was being changed; they were throwing us somewhere\r\nelse. We had disappeared from Gauchin under cover of darkness without\r\nseeing either the place or the people, without bidding them good-by\r\neven in a look, without bringing away a last impression.\r\n\r\nA locomotive was shunting, near enough to elbow us, and screaming\r\nfull-lunged. I saw Barque\'s mouth, stoppered by the clamor of our huge\r\nneighbor, pronounce an oath, and I saw the other faces grimacing in\r\ndeafened impotence, faces helmeted and chin-strapped, for we were\r\nsentries in the station.\r\n\r\n"After you!" yelled Barque furiously, addressing the white-plumed\r\nwhistle. But the terrible mechanism continued more imperiously than\r\never to drive his words back in his throat. When it ceased, and only\r\nits echo rang in our ears, the thread of the discourse was broken for\r\never, and Barque contented himself with the brief conclusion, "Oui."\r\n\r\nThen we looked around us. We were lost in a sort of town. Interminable\r\nstrings of trucks, trains of forty to sixty carriages, were taking\r\nshape like rows of dark-fronted houses, low built, all alike, and\r\ndivided by alleys. Before us, alongside the collection of moving\r\nhouses, was the main line, the limitless street where the white rails\r\ndisappeared at both ends, swallowed up in distance. Sections of trains\r\nand complete trains were staggering in great horizontal columns,\r\nleaving their places, then taking them again. On every side one heard\r\nthe regular hammering on the armored ground, piercing whistles, the\r\nringing of warning bells, the solid metallic crash of the colossal\r\ncubes telescoping their steel stumps, with the counter-blows of chains\r\nand the rattle of the long carcases\' vertebrae. On the ground floor of\r\nthe building that arises in the middle of the station like a town hall,\r\nthe hurried bell of telegraph and telephone was at work, punctuated by\r\nvocal noises. All about on the dusty ground were the goods sheds, the\r\nlow stores through whose doors one could dimly see the stacked\r\ninteriors--the pointsmen\'s cabins, the bristling switches, the\r\nhydrants, the latticed iron posts whose wires ruled the sky like\r\nmusic-paper; here and there the signals, and rising naked over this\r\nflat and gloomy city, two steam cranes, like steeples.\r\n\r\nFarther away, on waste ground and vacant sites in the environs of the\r\nlabyrinth of platforms and buildings, military carts and lorries were\r\nstanding idle, and rows of horses, drawn out farther than one could see.\r\n\r\n"Talk about the job this is going to be!"--"A whole army corps\r\nbeginning to entrain this evening!"--"Tiens, they\'re coming now!"\r\n\r\nA cloud which overspread a noisy vibration of wheels and the rumble of\r\nhorses\' hoofs was coming near and getting bigger in the approach to the\r\nstation formed by converging buildings.\r\n\r\n"There are already some guns on board." On some flat trucks down there,\r\nbetween two long pyramidal dumps of chests, we saw indeed the outline\r\nof wheels, and some slender muzzles. Ammunition wagons, guns and wheels\r\nwere streaked and blotched with yellow, brown, and green.\r\n\r\n"They\'re camoufles. [note 1] Down there, there are even horses painted.\r\nLook! spot that one, there, with the big feet as if he had trousers on.\r\nWell, he was white, and they\'ve slapped some paint on to change his\r\ncolor."\r\n\r\nThe horse in question was standing apart from the others, which seemed\r\nto mistrust it, and displayed a grayish yellow tone, obviously with\r\nintent to deceive. "Poor devil!" said Tulacque.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Paradis, "we not only take \'em to get killed, but mess\r\nthem about first!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s for their good, any way!"\r\n\r\n"Eh oui, and us too, it\'s for our good!"\r\n\r\nTowards evening soldiers arrived. From all sides they flowed towards\r\nthe station. Deep-voiced non-coms. ran in front of the files. They were\r\nstemming the tide of men and massing them along the barriers or in\r\nrailed squares--pretty well everywhere. The men piled their arms,\r\ndropped their knapsacks, and not being free to go out, waited, buried\r\nside by side in shadow.\r\n\r\nThe arrivals followed each other in volume that grew as the twilight\r\ndeepened. Along with the troops, the motors flowed up, and soon there\r\nwas an unbroken roar. Limousines glided through an enormous sea of\r\nlorries, little, middling, and big. All these cleared aside, wedged\r\nthemselves in, subsided in their appointed places. A vast hum of voices\r\nand mingled noises arose from the ocean of men and vehicles that beat\r\nupon the approaches to the station and began in places to filter\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nothing yet," said Cocon, The Man of Figures. "At Army Corps\r\nHeadquarters alone there are thirty officers\' motors; and you don\'t\r\nknow," he added, "how many trains of fifty trucks it takes to entrain\r\nall the Corpsmen and all the box of tricks--except, of course, the\r\nlorries, that\'ll join the new sector on their feet? Don\'t guess,\r\nflat-face. It takes ninety."\r\n\r\n"Great Scott! And there are thirty-three Corps?"\r\n\r\n"There are thirty-nine, lousy one!"\r\n\r\nThe turmoil increases; the station becomes still more populous. As far\r\nas the eye can make out a shape or the ghost of a shape, there is a\r\nhurly-burly of movement as lively as a panic. All the hierarchy of the\r\nnon-coms. expand themselves and go into action, pass and repass like\r\nmeteors, wave their bright-striped arms, and multiply the commands and\r\ncounter-commands that are carried by the worming orderlies and\r\ncyclists, the former tardy, the latter maneuvering in quick dashes,\r\nlike fish in water.\r\n\r\nHere now is evening, definitely. The blots made by the uniforms of the\r\npoilus grouped about the hillocks of rifles become indistinct, and\r\nblend with the ground; and then their mass is betrayed only by the glow\r\nof pipes and cigarettes. In some places on the edge of the clusters,\r\nthe little bright points festoon the gloom like illuminated streamers\r\nin a merry-making street.\r\n\r\nOver this confused and heaving expanse an amalgam of voices rises like\r\nthe sea breaking on the shore: and above this unending murmur, renewed\r\ncommands, shouts, the din of a shot load or of one transferred, the\r\ncrash of steam-hammers redoubling their dull endeavors, and the roaring\r\nof boilers.\r\n\r\nIn the immense obscurity, surcharged with men and with all things,\r\nlights begin everywhere to appear. These are the flash-lamps of\r\nofficers and detachment leaders, and the cyclists\' acetylene lamps,\r\nwhose intensely white points zigzag hither and thither and reveal an\r\nouter zone of pallid resurrection.\r\n\r\nAn acetylene searchlight blazes blindingly out and depicts a dome of\r\ndaylight. Other beams pierce and rend the universal gray.\r\n\r\nThen does the station assume a fantastic air. Mysterious shapes spring\r\nup and adhere to the sky\'s dark blue. Mountains come into view,\r\nrough-modeled, and vast as the ruins of a town. One can see the\r\nbeginning of unending rows of objects, finally plunged in night. One\r\nguesses what the great bulks may be whose outermost outlines flash\r\nforth from a black abyss of the unknown.\r\n\r\nOn our left, detachments of cavalry and infantry move ever forward like\r\na ponderous flood. We hear the diffused obscurity of voices. We see\r\nsome ranks delineated by a flash of phosphorescent light or a ruddy\r\nglimmering, and we listen to long-drawn trails of noise.\r\n\r\nUp the gangways of the vans whose gray trunks and black mouths one sees\r\nby the dancing and smoking flame of torches, artillerymen are leading\r\nhorses. There are appeals and shouts, a frantic trampling of conflict,\r\nand the angry kicking of some restive animal--insulted by its\r\nguide--against the panels of the van where he is cloistered.\r\n\r\nNot far away, they are putting wagons on to railway trucks. Swarming\r\nhumanity surrounds a hill of trusses of fodder. A scattered multitude\r\nfuriously attacks great strata of bales.\r\n\r\n"That\'s three hours we\'ve been on our pins," sighs Paradis.\r\n\r\n"And those, there, what are they?" In some snatches of light we see a\r\ngroup of goblins, surrounded by glowworms and carrying strange\r\ninstruments, come out and then disappear.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the searchlight section," says Cocon.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got your considering cap on, camarade; what\'s it about?"\r\n\r\n"There are four Divisions, at present, in an Army Corps," replies\r\nCocon; "the number changes, sometimes it is three, sometimes five. Just\r\nnow, it\'s four. And each of our Divisions," continues the mathematical\r\none, whom our squad glories in owning, "includes three R.I.--regiments\r\nof infantry; two B.C.P.--battalions of chasseurs pied; one\r\nR.T.I.--regiment of territorial infantry--without counting the special\r\nregiments, Artillery, Engineers, Transport, etc., and not counting\r\neither Headquarters of the D.I. and the departments not brigaded but\r\nattached directly to the D.I. A regiment of the line of three\r\nbattalions occupies four trains, one for H.Q., the machine-gun company,\r\nand the C.H.R. (compagnie hors rang [note 2]), and one to each\r\nbattalion. All the troops won\'t entrain here. They\'ll entrain in\r\nechelons along the line according to the position of the quarters and\r\nthe period of reliefs."\r\n\r\n"I\'m tired," says Tulacque. "We don\'t get enough solids to eat, mark\r\nyou. We stand up because it\'s the fashion, but we\'ve no longer either\r\nforce or freshness."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been getting information," Cocon goes on; "the troops--the real\r\ntroops--will only entrain as from midnight. They are still mustered\r\nhere and there in the villages ten kilometers round about. All the\r\ndepartments of the Army Corps will first set off, and the\r\nE.N.E.--elements non endivisionnes," Cocon obligingly explains, "that\r\nis, attached directly to the A.C. Among the E.N.E. you won\'t see the\r\nBalloon Department nor the Squadron--they\'re too big goods, and they\r\nnavigate on their own, with their staff and officers and hospitals. The\r\nchasseurs regiment is another of these E.N.E."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no regiment of chasseurs," says Barque, thoughtlessly, "it\'s\r\nbattalions. One says \'such and such a battalion of chasseurs.\'"\r\n\r\nWe can see Cocon shrugging his shoulders in the shadows, and his\r\nglasses cast a scornful gleam. "Think so, duck-neb? Then I\'ll tell you,\r\nsince you\'re so clever, there are two--foot chasseurs and horse\r\nchasseurs."\r\n\r\n"Gad! I forgot the horsemen," says Barque.\r\n\r\n"Only them!" Cocon said. "In the E.N.E. of the Army Corps, there\'s the\r\nCorps Artillery, that is to say, the central artillery that\'s\r\nadditional to that of the divisions. It includes the H.A.--heavy\r\nartillery; the T.A.--trench artillery; the A.D.--artillery depot, the\r\narmored cars, the anti-aircraft batteries--do I know, or don\'t I?\r\nThere\'s the Engineers; the Military Police--to wit, the service of cops\r\non foot and slops on horseback; the Medical Department; the Veterinary\r\nditto; a squadron of the Draught Corps; a Territorial regiment for the\r\nguards and fatigues at H.Q.--Headquarters; the Service de l\'Intendance,\r\n[note 3] and the supply column. There\'s also the drove of cattle, the\r\nRemount Depot, the Motor Department--talk about the swarm of soft jobs\r\nI could tell you about in an hour if I wanted to!--the Paymaster that\r\ncontrols the pay-offices and the Post, the Council of War, the\r\nTelegraphists, and all the electrical lot. All those have chiefs,\r\ncommandants, sections and sub-sections, and they\'re rotten with clerks\r\nand orderlies of sorts, and all the bally box of tricks. You can see\r\nfrom here the sort of job the C.O. of a Corp\'s got!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment we were surrounded by a party of soldiers carrying boxes\r\nin addition to their equipment, and parcels tied up in paper that they\r\nbore reluctantly and anon placed on the ground, puffing.\r\n\r\n"Those are the Staff secretaries. They are a part of the\r\nH.Q.--Headquarters--that is to say, a sort of General\'s suite. When\r\nthey\'re flitting, they lug about their chests of records, their tables,\r\ntheir registers, and all the dirty oddments they need for their\r\nwriting. Tiens! see that, there; it\'s a typewriter those two are\r\ncarrying, the old papa and the little sausage, with a rifle threaded\r\nthrough the parcel. They\'re in three offices, and there\'s also the\r\ndispatch-riders\' section, the Chancellerie, the A.C.T.S.--Army Corps\r\nTopographical Section--that distributes maps to the Divisions, and\r\nmakes maps and plans from the aviators and the observers and the\r\nprisoners. It\'s the officers of all the departments who, under the\r\norders of two colonels, form the Staff of the Army Corps. But the H.Q.,\r\nproperly so called, which also includes orderlies, cooks, storekeepers,\r\nworkpeople, electricians, police, and the horsemen of the Escort, is\r\nbossed by a commandant."\r\n\r\nAt this moment we receive collectively a tremendous bump. "Hey, look\r\nout! Out of the way!" cries a man, by way of apology, who is being\r\nassisted by several others to push a cart towards the wagons. The work\r\nis hard, for the ground slopes up, and so soon as they cease to\r\nbuttress themselves against the cart and adhere to the wheels, it slips\r\nback. The sullen men crush themselves against it in the depth of the\r\ngloom, grinding their teeth and growling, as though they fell upon some\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nBarque, all the while rubbing his back, questions one of the frantic\r\ngang: "Think you\'re going to do it, old duckfoot?"\r\n\r\n"Nom de Dieu!" roars he, engrossed in his job, "mind these setts!\r\nYou\'re going to wreck the show!" With a sudden movement he jostles\r\nBarque again, and this time turns round on him: "What are you doing\r\nthere, dung-guts, numskull?"\r\n\r\n"Non, it can\'t be that you\'re drunk?" Barque retorts. "\'What am I doing\r\nhere?\' It\'s good, that! Tell me, you lousy gang, wouldn\'t you like to\r\ndo it too!"\r\n\r\n"Out of the way!" cries a new voice, which precedes some men doubled up\r\nunder burdens incongruous, but apparently overwhelming.\r\n\r\nOne can no longer remain anywhere. Everywhere we are in the way. We go\r\nforward, we scatter, we retire in the turmoil.\r\n\r\n"In addition, I tell you," continues Cocon, tranquil as a scientist,\r\n"there are the Divisions, each organized pretty much like an Army\r\nCorps--"\r\n\r\n"Oui, we know it; miss the deal!"\r\n\r\n"He makes a fine to-do about it all, that mountebank in the horse-box\r\non casters. What a mother-in-law he\'d make!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet that\'s the Major\'s wrong-headed horse, the one that the vet\r\nsaid was a calf in process of becoming a cow."\r\n\r\n"It\'s well organized, all the same, all that, no doubt about it," says\r\nLamuse admiringly, forced back by a wave of artillerymen carrying boxes.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," Marthereau admits; "to get all this lot on the way,\r\nyou\'ve not got to be a lot of turnip-heads nor a lot of custards--Bon\r\nDieu, look where you\'re putting your damned boots, you black-livered\r\nbeast!"\r\n\r\n"Talk about a flitting! When I went to live at Marcoussis with my\r\nfamily, there was less fuss than this. But then I\'m not built that way\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nWe are silent; and then we hear Cocon saying, "For the whole French\r\nArmy that holds the lines to go by--I\'m not speaking of those who are\r\nfixed up at the rear, where there are twice as many men again, and\r\nservices like the ambulance that cost nine million francs and can clear\r\nyou seven thousand cases a day--to see them go by in trains of sixty\r\ncoaches each, following each other without stopping, at intervals of a\r\nquarter of an hour, it would take forty days and forty nights."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" they say. It is too much effort for their imagination; they lose\r\ninterest and sicken of the magnitude of these figures. They yawn, and\r\nwith watering eyes they follow, in the confusion of haste and shouts\r\nand smoke, of roars and gleams and flashes, the terrible line of the\r\narmored train that moves in the distance, with fire in the sky behind\r\nit.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1:] The word is likely to become of international usage. It\r\nstands for the use of paint in blotches of different colors, and of\r\nbranches and other things to disguise almost any object that may be\r\nvisible to hostile aircraft.--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 2:] Non-combatant.--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 3:] Akin to the British A.S.C.--Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nOn Leave\r\n\r\n\r\nEUDORE sat down awhile, there by the roadside well, before taking the\r\npath over the fields that led to the trenches, his hands crossed over\r\none knee, his pale face uplifted. He had no mustache under his\r\nnose--only a little flat smear over each corner of his mouth. He\r\nwhistled, and then yawned in the face of the morning till the tears\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nAn artilleryman who was quartered on the edge of the wood--over there\r\nwhere a line of horses and carts looked like a gypsies\' bivouac--came\r\nup, with the well in his mind, and two canvas buckets that danced at\r\nthe end of his arms in time with his feet. In front of the sleepy\r\nunarmed soldier with a bulging bag he stood fast.\r\n\r\n"On leave?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Eudore; "just back."\r\n\r\n"Good for you," said the gunner as he made off.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve nothing to grumble at--with six days\' leave in your\r\nwater-bottle!"\r\n\r\nAnd here, see, are four more men coming down the road, their gait heavy\r\nand slow, their boots turned into enormous caricatures of boots by\r\nreason of the mud. As one man they stopped on espying the profile of\r\nEudore.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Eudore! Hello, Eudore! hello, the old sport! You\'re back\r\nthen!" they cried together, as they hurried up and offered him hands as\r\nbig and ruddy as if they were hidden in woolen gloves.\r\n\r\n"Morning, boys," said Eudore.\r\n\r\n"Had a good time? What have you got to tell us, my boy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Eudore, "not so bad."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been on wine fatigue, and we\'ve finished. Let\'s go back\r\ntogether, pas?"\r\n\r\nIn single file they went down the embankment of the road--arm in arm\r\nthey crossed the field of gray mud, where their feet fell with the\r\nsound of dough being mixed in the kneading-trough.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve seen your wife, your little Mariette--the only girl for\r\nyou--that you could never open your jaw without telling us a tale about\r\nher, eh?"\r\n\r\nEudore\'s wan face winced.\r\n\r\n"My wife? Yes, I saw her, sure enough, but only for a little\r\nwhile--there was no way of doing any better--but no luck, I admit, and\r\nthat\'s all about it."\r\n\r\n"How\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"How? You know that we live at Villers-l\'Abbaye, a hamlet of four\r\nhouses neither more nor less, astraddle over the road. One of those\r\nhouses is our cafe, and she runs it, or rather she is running it again\r\nsince they gave up shelling the village.\r\n\r\n"Now then, with my leave coming along, she asked for a permit to\r\nMont-St-Eloi, where my old folks are, and my permit was for\r\nMont-St-Eloi too. See the move?\r\n\r\n"Being a little woman with a head-piece, you know, she had applied for\r\nher permit long before the date when my leave was expected. All the\r\nsame, my leave came before her permit. Spite o\' that I set off--for one\r\ndoesn\'t let his turn in the company go by, eh? So I stayed with the old\r\npeople, and waited. I like \'em well enough, but I got down in the mouth\r\nall the same. As for them, it was enough that they could see me, and it\r\nworried them that I was bored by their company-how else could it be? At\r\nthe end of the sixth day--at the finish of my leave, and the very\r\nevening before returning--a young man on a bicycle, son of the Florence\r\nfamily, brings me a letter from Mariette to say that her permit had not\r\nyet come--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, rotten luck," cried the audience.\r\n\r\n"And that," continued Eudore, "there was only one thing to do.--I was\r\nto get leave from the mayor of Mont-St-Eloi, who would get it from the\r\nmilitary, and go myself at full speed to see her at Villers."\r\n\r\n"You should have done that the first day, not the sixth!"\r\n\r\n"So it seems, but I was afraid we should cross and me miss her--y\'see,\r\nas soon as I landed, I was expecting her all the time, and every minute\r\nI fancied I could see her at the open door. So I did as she told me."\r\n\r\n"After all, you saw her?"\r\n\r\n"Just one day--or rather, just one night."\r\n\r\n"Quite sufficient!" merrily said Lamuse, and Eudore the pale and\r\nserious shook his head under the shower of pointed and perilous jests\r\nthat followed.\r\n\r\n"Shut your great mouths for five minutes, chaps."\r\n\r\n"Get on with it, petit."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t a great lot of it," said Eudore.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you were saying you had got a hump with your old people?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. They had tried their best to make up for Mariette--with\r\nlovely rashers of our own ham, and plum brandy, and patching up my\r\nlinen, and all sorts of little spoiled-kid tricks--and I noticed they\r\nwere still slanging each other in the old familiar way! But you talk\r\nabout a difference! I always had my eye on the door to see if some time\r\nor other it wouldn\'t get a move on and turn into a woman. So I went and\r\nsaw the mayor, and set off, yesterday, towards two in the\r\nafternoon--towards fourteen o\'clock I might well say, seeing that I had\r\nbeen counting the hours since the day before! I had just one day of my\r\nleave left then.\r\n\r\n"As we drew near in the dusk, through the carriage window of the little\r\nrailway that still keeps going down there on some fag-ends of line, I\r\nrecognized half the country, and the other half I didn\'t. Here and\r\nthere I got the sense of it, all at once, and it came back all fresh to\r\nme, and melted away again, just as if it was talking to me. Then it\r\nshut up. In the end we got out, and I found--the limit, that was--that\r\nwe had to pad the hoof to the last station.\r\n\r\n"Never, old man, have I been in such weather. It had rained for six\r\ndays. For six days the sky washed the earth and then washed it again.\r\nThe earth was softening and shifting, and filling up the holes and\r\nmaking new ones."\r\n\r\n"Same here--it only stopped raining this morning."\r\n\r\n"It was just my luck. And everywhere there were swollen new streams,\r\nwashing away the borders of the fields as though they were lines on\r\npaper. There were hills that ran with water from top to bottom. Gusts\r\nof wind sent the rain in great clouds flying and whirling about, and\r\nlashing our hands and faces and necks.\r\n\r\n"So you bet, when I had tramped to the station, if some one had pulled\r\na really ugly face at me, it would have been enough to make me turn\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"But when we did get to the place, there were several of us--some more\r\nmen on leave--they weren\'t bound for Villers, but they had to go\r\nthrough it to get somewhere else. So it happened that we got there in a\r\nlump--five old cronies that didn\'t know each other.\r\n\r\n"I could make out nothing of anything. They\'ve been worse shelled over\r\nthere than here, and then there was the water everywhere, and it was\r\ngetting dark.\r\n\r\n"I told you there are only four houses in the little place, only\r\nthey\'re a good bit off from each other. You come to the lower end of a\r\nslope. I didn\'t know too well where I was, no more than my pals did,\r\nthough they belonged to the district and had some notion of the lay of\r\nit--and all the less because of the rain falling in bucketsful.\r\n\r\n"It got so bad that we couldn\'t keep from hurrying and began to run. We\r\npassed by the farm of the Alleux--that\'s the first of the houses--and\r\nit looked like a sort of stone ghost. Bits of walls like splintered\r\npillars standing up out of the water; the house was shipwrecked. The\r\nother farm, a little further, was as good as drowned dead.\r\n\r\n"Our house is the third. It\'s on the edge of the road that runs along\r\nthe top of the slope. We climbed up, facing the rain that beat on us in\r\nthe dusk and began to blind us--the cold and wet fairly smacked us in\r\nthe eye, flop!--and broke our ranks like machine-guns.\r\n\r\n"The house! I ran like a greyhound--like an African attacking.\r\nMariette! I could see her with her arms raised high in the doorway\r\nbehind that fine curtain of night and rain--of rain so fierce that it\r\ndrove her back and kept her shrinking between the doorposts like a\r\nstatue of the Virgin in its niche. I just threw myself forward, but\r\nremembered to give my pals the sign to follow me. The house swallowed\r\nthe lot of us. Mariette laughed a little to see me, with a tear in her\r\neye. She waited till we were alone together and then laughed and cried\r\nall at once. I told the boys to make themselves at home and sit down,\r\nsome on the chairs and the rest on the table.\r\n\r\n"\'Where are they going, ces messieurs?\' asked Manette.\r\n\r\n"\'We are going to Vauvelles.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Jesus!\' she said, \'you\'ll never get there. You can\'t do those two\r\nmiles and more in the night, with the roads washed away, and swamps\r\neverywhere. You mustn\'t even try to.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, we\'ll go on to-morrow, then; only we must find somewhere to\r\npass the night.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ll go with you,\' I said, \'as far as the Pendu farm--they\'re not\r\nshort of room in that shop. You\'ll snore in there all right, and you\r\ncan start at daybreak.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Right! let\'s get a move on so far.\'\r\n\r\n"We went out again. What a downpour! We were wet past bearing. The\r\nwater poured into our socks through the boot-soles and by the trouser\r\nbottoms, and they too were soaked through and through up to the knees.\r\nBefore we got to this Pendu, we meet a shadow in a big black cloak,\r\nwith a lantern. The lantern is raised, and we see a gold stripe on the\r\nsleeve, and then an angry face.\r\n\r\n"\'What the hell are you doing there?\' says the shadow, drawing back a\r\nlittle and putting one fist on his hip, while the rain rattled like\r\nhail on his hood.\r\n\r\n"\'They\'re men on leave for Vauvelles--they can\'t set off again\r\nto-night--they would like to sleep in the Pendu farm.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What do you say? Sleep here?--This is the police station--I am the\r\nofficer on guard and there are Boche prisoners in the buildings.\' And\r\nI\'ll tell you what he said as well--\'I must see you hop it from here in\r\nless than two seconds. Bonsoir.\'\r\n\r\n"So we right about face and started back again--stumbling as if we were\r\nboozed, slipping, puffing, splashing and bespattering ourselves. One of\r\nthe boys cried to me through the wind and rain, \'We\'ll go back with you\r\nas far as your home, all the same. If we haven\'t a house we\'ve time\r\nenough.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Where will you sleep?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, we\'ll find somewhere, don\'t worry, for the little time we have to\r\nkill here.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, we\'ll find somewhere, all right,\' I said. \'Come in again for a\r\nminute meanwhile--I won\'t take no--and Mariette sees us enter once more\r\nin single file, all five of us soaked like bread in soup.\r\n\r\n"So there we all were, with only one little room to go round in and go\r\nround again--the only room in the house, seeing that it isn\'t a palace.\r\n\r\n"\'Tell me, madame,\' says one of our friends, \'isn\'t there a cellar\r\nhere?\'\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s water in it,\' says Mariette; \'you can\'t see the bottom step\r\nand it\'s only got two.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Damn,\' says the man, \'for I see there\'s no loft, either.\'\r\n\r\n"After a minute or two he gets up: \'Good-night, old pal,\' he says to\r\nme, and they get their hats on.\r\n\r\n"\'What, are you going off in weather like this, boys?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do you think,\' says the old sport, \'that we\'re going to spoil your\r\nstay with your wife?\'\r\n\r\n"\'But, my good man--\'\r\n\r\n"\'But me no buts. It\'s nine o\'clock, and you\'ve got to take your hook\r\nbefore day. So good-night. Coming, you others?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Rather,\' say the boys. \'Good-night all.\'\r\n\r\n"There they are at the door and opening it. Mariette and me, we look at\r\neach other--but we don\'t move. Once more we look at each other, and\r\nthen we sprang at them. I grabbed the skirt of a coat and she a\r\nbelt--all wet enough to wring out.\r\n\r\n"\'Never! We won\'t let you go--it can\'t be done.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But--\'\r\n\r\n"\'But me no buts,\' I reply, while she locks the door."\r\n\r\n"Then what?" asked Lamuse.\r\n\r\n"Then? Nothing at all," replied Eudore. "We just stayed like that, very\r\ndiscreetly--all the night--sitting, propped up in the corners,\r\nyawning--like the watchers over a dead man. We made a bit of talk at\r\nfirst. From time to time some one said, \'Is it still raining?\' and went\r\nand had a look, and said, \'It\'s still raining\'--we could hear it, by\r\nthe way. A big chap who had a mustache like a Bulgarian fought against\r\nsleeping like a wild man. Sometimes one or two among the crowd slept,\r\nbut there was always one to yawn and keep an eye open for politeness,\r\nwho stretched himself or half got up so that he could settle more\r\ncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"Mariette and me, we never slept. We looked at each other, but we\r\nlooked at the others as well, and they looked at us, and there you are.\r\n\r\n"Morning came and cleaned the window. I got up to go and look outside.\r\nThe rain was hardly less. In the room I could see dark forms that began\r\nto stir and breathe hard. Mariette\'s eyes were red with looking at me\r\nall night. Between her and me a soldier was filling his pipe and\r\nshivering.\r\n\r\n"Some one beats a tattoo on the window, and I half open it. A\r\nsilhouette with a streaming hat appears, as though carried and driven\r\nthere by the terrible force of the blast that came with it, and asks--\r\n\r\n"\'Hey, in the cafe there! Is there any coffee to be had?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Coming, sir, coming,\' cried Mariette.\r\n\r\n"She gets up from her chair, a little benumbed. Without a word she\r\nlooks at her self in our bit of a mirror, touches her hair lightly, and\r\nsays quite simply, the good lass--\r\n\r\n"\'I am going to make coffee for everybody.\'\r\n\r\n"When that was drunk off, we had all of us to go. Besides, customers\r\nturned up every minute.\r\n\r\n"\'Hey, la p\'tite mere,\' they cried, shoving their noses in at the\r\nhalf-open window, \'let\'s have a coffee--or three--or four\'--\'and two\r\nmore again,\' says another voice.\r\n\r\n"We go up to Mariette to say good-by. They knew they had played\r\ngooseberry that night most damnably, but I could see plainly that they\r\ndidn\'t know if it would be the thing to say something about it or just\r\nlet it drop altogether.\r\n\r\n"Then the Bulgarian made up his mind: \'We\'ve made a hell of a mess of\r\nit for you, eh, ma p\'tite dame?\'\r\n\r\n"He said that to show he\'d been well brought up, the old sport.\r\n\r\n"Mariette thanks him and offers him her hand--\'That\'s nothing at all,\r\nsir. I hope you\'ll enjoy your leave.\'\r\n\r\n"And me, I held her tight in my arms and kissed her as long as I\r\ncould--half a minute--discontented--my God, there was reason to be--but\r\nglad that Mariette had not driven the boys out like dogs, and I felt\r\nsure she liked me too for not doing it.\r\n\r\n"\'But that isn\'t all,\' said one of the leave men, lifting the skirt of\r\nhis cape and fumbling in his coat pocket; \'that\'s not all. What do we\r\nowe you for the coffees?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Nothing, for you stayed the night with me; you are my guests.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, madame, we can\'t have that!\'\r\n\r\n"And how they set to to make protests and compliments in front of each\r\nother! Old man, you can say what you like--we may be only poor devils,\r\nbut it was astonishing, that little palaver of good manners.\r\n\r\n"\'Come along! Let\'s be hopping it, eh?\'\r\n\r\n"They go out one by one. I stay till the last. Just then another\r\npasser-by begins to knock on the window--another who was dying for a\r\nmouthful of coffee. Mariette by the open door leaned forward and cried,\r\n\'One second!\'\r\n\r\n"Then she put into my arms a parcel that she had ready. \'I had bought a\r\nknuckle of ham--it was for supper--for us--for us two--and a liter of\r\ngood wine. But, ma foi! when I saw there were five of you, I didn\'t\r\nwant to divide it out so much, and I want still less now. There\'s the\r\nham, the bread, and the wine. I give them to you so that you can enjoy\r\nthem by yourself, my boy. As for them, we have given them enough,\' she\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n"Poor Mariette," sighs Eudore. "Fifteen months since I\'d seen her. And\r\nwhen shall I see her again? Ever?--It was jolly, that idea of hers. She\r\ncrammed all that stuff into my bag--"\r\n\r\nHe half opens his brown canvas pouch.\r\n\r\n"Look, here they are! The ham here, and the bread, and there\'s the\r\nbooze. Well, seeing it\'s there, you don\'t know what we\'re going to do\r\nwith it? We\'re going to share it out between us, eh, old pals?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe Anger of Volpatte\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Volpatte arrived from his sick-leave, after two months\' absence,\r\nwe surrounded him. But he was sullen and silent, and tried to get away.\r\n\r\n"Well, what about it? Volpatte, have you nothing to tell us?"\r\n\r\n"Tell us all about the hospital and the sick-leave, old cock, from the\r\nday when you set off in your bandages, with your snout in parenthesis!\r\nYou must have seen something of the official shops. Speak then, nome de\r\nDieu!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to say anything at all about it," said Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that? What are you talking about?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m fed up--that\'s what I am! The people back there, I\'m sick of\r\nthem--they make me spew, and you can tell \'em so!"\r\n\r\n"What have they done to you?"\r\n\r\n"A lot of sods, they are!" says Volpatte.\r\n\r\nThere he was, with his head as of yore, his ears "stuck on again" and\r\nhis Mongolian cheekbones--stubbornly set in the middle of the puzzled\r\ncircle that besieged him; and we felt that the mouth fast closed on\r\nominous silence meant high pressure of seething exasperation in the\r\ndepth of him.\r\n\r\nSome words overflowed from him at last. He turned round--facing towards\r\nthe rear and the bases--and shook his fist at infinite space. "There\r\nare too many of them," he said between his teeth, "there are too many!"\r\nHe seemed to be threatening and repelling a rising sea of phantoms.\r\n\r\nA little later, we questioned him again, knowing well that his anger\r\ncould not thus be retained within, and that the savage silence would\r\nexplode at the first chance.\r\n\r\nIt was in a deep communication trench, away back, where we had come\r\ntogether for a meal after a morning spent in digging. Torrential rain\r\nwas falling. We were muddled and drenched and hustled by the flood, and\r\nwe ate standing in single file, without shelter, under the dissolving\r\nsky. Only by feats of skill could we protect the bread and bully from\r\nthe spouts that flowed from every point in space; and while we ate we\r\nput our hands and faces as much as possible under our cowls. The rain\r\nrattled and bounced and streamed on our limp woven armor, and worked\r\nwith open brutality or sly secrecy into ourselves and our food. Our\r\nfeet were sinking farther and farther, taking deep root in the stream\r\nthat flowed along the clayey bottom of the trench. Some faces were\r\nlaughing, though their mustaches dripped. Others grimaced at the spongy\r\nbread and flabby meat, or at the missiles which attacked their skin\r\nfrom all sides at every defect in their heavy and miry armor-plate.\r\n\r\nBarque, who was hugging his mess-tin to his heart, bawled at Volpatte:\r\n"Well then, a lot of sods, you say, that you\'ve seen down there where\r\nyou\'ve been?"\r\n\r\n"For instance?" cried Blaire, while a redoubled squall shook and\r\nscattered his words; "what have you seen in the way of sods?"\r\n\r\n"There are--" Volpatte began, "and then--there are too many of them,\r\nnom de Dieu! There are--"\r\n\r\nHe tried to say what was the matter with him, but could only repeat,\r\n"There are too many of them!" oppressed and panting. He swallowed a\r\npulpy mouthful of bread as if there went with it the disordered and\r\nsuffocating mass of his memories.\r\n\r\n"Is it the shirkers you want to talk about?"\r\n\r\n"By God!" He had thrown the rest of his beef over the parapet, and this\r\ncry, this gasp, escaped violently from his mouth as if from a valve.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about the soft-job brigade, old cross-patch," advised\r\nBarque, banteringly, but not without some bitterness. "What good does\r\nit do?"\r\n\r\nConcealed and huddled up under the fragile and unsteady roof of his\r\noiled hood, while the water poured down its shining slopes, and holding\r\nhis empty mess-tin out for the rain to clean it, Volpatte snarled, "I\'m\r\nnot daft--not a bit of it--and I know very well there\'ve got to be\r\nthese individuals at the rear. Let them have their dead-heads for all I\r\ncare--but there\'s too many of them, and they\'re all alike, and all\r\nrotters, voila!"\r\n\r\nRelieved by this affirmation, which shed a little light on the gloomy\r\nfarrago of fury he was loosing among us, Volpatte began to speak in\r\nfragments across the relentless sheets of rain--\r\n\r\n"At the very first village they sent me to, I saw duds, and duds\r\ngalore, and they began to get on my nerves. All sorts of departments\r\nand sub-departments and managements and centers and offices and\r\ncommittees--you\'re no sooner there than you meet swarms of fools,\r\nswarms of different services that are only different in name--enough to\r\nturn your brain. I tell you, the man that invented the names of all\r\nthose committees, he was wrong in his head.\r\n\r\n"So could I help but be sick of it? Ah, mon vieux," said our comrade,\r\nmusing, "all those individuals fiddle-faddling and making believe down\r\nthere, all spruced up with their fine caps and officers\' coats and\r\nshameful boots, that gulp dainties and can put a dram of best brandy\r\ndown their gullets whenever they want, and wash themselves oftener\r\ntwice than once, and go to church, and never stop smoking, and pack\r\nthemselves up in feathers at night to read the newspaper--and then they\r\nsay afterwards, \'I\'ve been in the war!\'"\r\n\r\nOne point above all had got hold of Volpatte and emerged from his\r\nconfused and impassioned vision: "All those soldiers, they haven\'t to\r\nrun away with their table-tools and get a bite any old way--they\'ve got\r\nto be at their ease--they\'d rather go and sit themselves down with some\r\ntart in the district, at a special reserved table, and guzzle\r\nvegetables, and the fine lady puts their crockery out all square for\r\nthem on the dining-table, and their pots of jam and every other blasted\r\nthing to eat; in short, the advantages of riches and peace in that\r\ndoubly-damned hell they call the Rear!"\r\n\r\nVolpatte\'s neighbor shook his head under the torrents that fell from\r\nheaven and said, "So much the better for them."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not crazy--" Volpatte began again.\r\n\r\n"P\'raps, but you\'re not fair."\r\n\r\nVolpatte felt himself insulted by the word. He started, and raised his\r\nhead furiously, and the rain, that was waiting for the chance, took him\r\nplump in the face. "Not fair--me? Not fair--to those dung-hills?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly, monsieur," the neighbor replied; "I tell you that you play\r\nhell with them and yet you\'d jolly well like to be in the rotters\'\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Very likely--but what does that prove, rump-face? To begin with, we,\r\nwe\'ve been in danger, and it ought to be our turn for the other. But\r\nthey\'re always the same, I tell you; and then there\'s young men there,\r\nstrong as bulls and poised like wrestlers, and then--there are too many\r\nof them! D\'you hear? It\'s always too many, I say, because it is so."\r\n\r\n"Too many? What do you know about it, vilain? These departments and\r\ncommittees, do you know what they are?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what they are," Volpatte set off again, "but I know--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think they need a crowd to keep all the army\'s affairs\r\ngoing?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a damn, but--"\r\n\r\n"But you wish it was you, eh?" chaffed the invisible neighbor, who\r\nconcealed in the depth of the hood on which the reservoirs of space\r\nwere emptying either a supreme indifference or a cruel desire to take a\r\nrise out of Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it," said the other, simply.\r\n\r\n"There\'s those that can help it for you," interposed the shrill voice\r\nof Barque; "I knew one of \'em--"\r\n\r\n"I, too, I\'ve seen \'em!" Volpatte yelled with a desperate effort\r\nthrough the storm. "Tiens! not far from the front, don\'t know where\r\nexactly, where there\'s an ambulance clearing-station and a\r\nsous-intendance--I met the reptile there."\r\n\r\nThe wind, as it passed over us, tossed him the question, "What was it?"\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a lull, and the weather allowed Volpatte to\r\ntalk after a fashion. He said: "He took me round all the jumble of the\r\ndepot as if it was a fair, although he was one of the sights of the\r\nplace. He led me along the passages and into the dining-rooms of houses\r\nand supplementary barracks. He half opened doors with labels on them,\r\nand said, \'Look here, and here too--look!\' I went inspecting with him,\r\nbut he didn\'t go back, like I did, to the trenches, don\'t fret\r\nyourself, and he wasn\'t coming back from them either, don\'t worry! The\r\nreptile, the first time I saw him he was walking nice and leisurely in\r\nthe yard--\'I\'m in the Expenses Department,\' he says. We talked a bit,\r\nand the next day he got an orderly job so as to dodge getting sent\r\naway, seeing it was his turn to go since the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\n"On the step of the door where he\'d laid all night on a feather bed, he\r\nwas polishing the pumps of his monkey master--beautiful yellow\r\npumps--rubbing \'em with paste, fairly glazing \'em, my boy. I stopped to\r\nwatch him, and the chap told me all about himself. Mon vieux, I don\'t\r\nremember much more of the stuffing that came out of his crafty skull\r\nthan I remember of the History of France and the dates we whined at\r\nschool. Never, I tell you, had he been sent to the front, although he\r\nwas Class 1903, [note 1] and a lusty devil at that, he was. Danger and\r\ndog-tiredness and all the ugliness of war--not for him, but for the\r\nothers, oui. He knew damned well that if he set foot in the\r\nfiring-line, the line would see that the beast got it, so he ran like\r\nhell from it, and stopped where he was. He said they\'d tried all ways\r\nto get him, but he\'d given the slip to all the captains, all the\r\ncolonels, all the majors, and they were all damnably mad with him. He\r\ntold me about it. How did he work it? He\'d sit down all of a sudden,\r\nput on a stupid look, do the scrim-shanker stunt, and flop like a\r\nbundle of dirty linen. \'I\'ve got a sort of general fatigue,\' he\'d\r\nblubber. They didn\'t know how to take him, and after a bit they just\r\nlet him drop--everybody was fit to spew on him. And he changed his\r\ntricks according to the circumstances, d\'you catch on? Sometimes he had\r\nsomething wrong with his foot--he was damned clever with his feet. And\r\nthen he contrived things, and he knew one head from another, and how to\r\ntake his opportunities. He knew what\'s what, he did. You could see him\r\ngo and slip in like a pretty poilu among the depot chaps, where the\r\nsoft jobs were, and stay there; and then he\'d put himself out no end to\r\nbe useful to the pals. He\'d get up at three o\'clock in the morning to\r\nmake the juice, go and fetch the water while the others were getting\r\ntheir grub. At last, he\'d wormed himself in everywhere, he came to be\r\none of the family, the rotter, the carrion. He did it so he wouldn\'t\r\nhave to do it. He seemed to me like an individual that would have\r\nearned five quid honestly with the same work and bother that he puts\r\ninto forging a one-pound note. But there, he\'ll get his skin out of it\r\nall right, he will. At the front he\'d be lost sight of in the throng of\r\nit, but he\'s not so stupid. Be damned to them, he says, that take their\r\ngrub on the ground, and be damned to them still more when they\'re under\r\nit. When we\'ve all done with fighting, he\'ll go back home and he\'ll say\r\nto his friends and neighbors, \'Here I am safe and sound,\' and his\r\npals\'ll be glad, because be\'s a good sort, with engaging manners,\r\ncontemptible creature that he is, and--and this is the most stupid\r\nthing of all--but he takes you in and you swallow him whole, the son of\r\na bug.\r\n\r\n"And then, those sort of beings, don\'t you believe there\'s only one of\r\nthem. There are barrels of \'em in every depot, that hang on and writhe\r\nwhen their time comes to go, and they say, \'I\'m not going,\' and they\r\ndon\'t go, and they never succeed in driving them as far as the front."\r\n\r\n"Nothing new in all that," said Barque, "we know it, we know it!"\r\n\r\n"Then there are the offices," Volpatte went on, engrossed in his story\r\nof travel; "whole houses and streets and districts. I saw that my\r\nlittle corner in the rear was only a speck, and I had full view of\r\nthem. Non, I\'d never have believed there\'d be so many men on chairs\r\nwhile war was going on--"\r\n\r\nA hand protruded from the rank and made trial of space--"No more sauce\r\nfalling"--"Then we\'re going out, bet your life on it." So "March!" was\r\nthe cry.\r\n\r\nThe storm held its peace. We filed off in the long narrow swamp\r\nstagnating in the bottom of the trench where the moment before it had\r\nshaken under slabs of rain. Volpatte\'s grumbling began again amidst our\r\nsorry stroll and the eddies of floundering feet. I listened to him as I\r\nwatched the shoulders of a poverty-stricken overcoat swaying in front\r\nof me, drenched through and through. This time Volpatte was on the\r\ntrack of the police--\r\n\r\n"The farther you go from the front the more you see of them."\r\n\r\n"Their battlefield is not the same as ours."\r\n\r\nTulacque had an ancient grudge against them. "Look," he said, "how the\r\nbobbies spread themselves about to get good lodgings and good food, and\r\nthen, after the drinking regulations, they dropped on the secret\r\nwine-sellers. You saw them lying in wait, with a corner of an eye on\r\nthe shop-doors, to see if there weren\'t any poilus slipping quietly\r\nout, two-faced that they are, leering to left and to right and licking\r\ntheir mustaches."\r\n\r\n"There are good ones among \'em. I knew one in my country, the Cote\r\nd\'Or, where I--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" was Tulacque\'s peremptory interruption; "they\'re all alike.\r\nThere isn\'t one that can put another right."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they\'re lucky," said Volpatte, "but do you think they\'re\r\ncontented? Not a bit; they grouse. At least," he corrected himself,\r\n"there was one I met, and he was a grouser. He was devilish bothered by\r\nthe drill-manual. \'It isn\'t worth while to learn the drill\r\ninstruction,\' he said, \'they\'re always changing it. F\'r instance, take\r\nthe department of military police; well, as soon as you\'ve got the gist\r\nof it, it\'s something else. Ah, when will this war be over?\' he says."\r\n\r\n"They do what they\'re told to do, those chaps," ventured Eudore.\r\n\r\n"Surely. It isn\'t their fault at all. It doesn\'t alter the fact that\r\nthese professional soldiers, pensioned and decorated in the time when\r\nwe\'re only civvies, will have made war in a damned funny way."\r\n\r\n"That reminds me of a forester that I saw as well," said Volpatte, "who\r\nplayed hell about the fatigues they put him to. \'It\'s disgusting,\' the\r\nfellow said to me, \'what they do with us. We\'re old non-coms., soldiers\r\nthat have done four years of service at least. We\'re paid on the higher\r\nscale, it\'s true, but what of that? We are Officials, and yet they\r\nhumiliate us. At H.Q. they set us to cleaning, and carrying the dung\r\naway. The civilians see the treatment they inflict on us, and they look\r\ndown on us. And if you look like grousing, they\'ll actually talk about\r\nsending you off to the trenches, like foot-soldiers! What\'s going to\r\nbecome of our prestige? When we go back to the parishes as rangers\r\nafter the war--if we do come back from it--the people of the villages\r\nand forests will say, "Ah, it was you that was sweeping the streets at\r\nX--!" To get back our prestige, compromised by human injustice and\r\ningratitude, I know well,\' he says, \'that we shall have to make\r\ncomplaints, and make complaints and make \'em with all our might, to the\r\nrich and to the influential!\' he says."\r\n\r\n"I knew a gendarme who was all right," said Lamuse. "\'The police are\r\ntemperate enough in general,\' he says, \'but there are always dirty\r\ndevils everywhere, pas? The civilian is really afraid of the gendarme,\'\r\nsays he, \'and that\'s a fact; and so, I admit it, there are some who\r\ntake advantage of it, and those ones--the tag-rag of the\r\ngendarmerie--know where to get a glass or two. If I was Chief or\r\nBrigadier, I\'d screw \'em down; not half I wouldn\'t,\' he says; \'for\r\npublic opinion,\' he says again, \'lays the blame on the whole force when\r\na single one with a grievance makes a complaint.\'"\r\n\r\n"As for me," says Paradis, "one of the worst days of my life was once\r\nwhen I saluted a gendarme, taking him for a lieutenant, with his white\r\nstripes. Fortunately--I don\'t say it to console myself, but because\r\nit\'s probably true--fortunately, I don\'t think he saw me."\r\n\r\nA silence. "Oui, \'vidently," the men murmured; "but what about it? No\r\nneed to worry."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nA little later, when we were seated along a wall, with our backs to the\r\nstones, and our feet plunged and planted in the ground, Volpatte\r\ncontinued unloading his impressions.\r\n\r\n"I went into a big room that was a Depot office--bookkeeping\r\ndepartment, I believe. It swarmed with tables, and people in it like in\r\na market. Clouds of talk. All along the walls on each side and in the\r\nmiddle, personages sitting in front of their spread-out goods like\r\nwaste-paper merchants. I put in a request to be put back into my\r\nregiment, and they said to me, \'Take your damned hook, and get busy\r\nwith it.\' I lit on a sergeant, a little chap with airs, spick as a\r\ndaisy, with a gold-rimmed spy-glass--eye-glasses with a tape on them.\r\nHe was young, but being a re-enlisted soldier, he had the right not to\r\ngo to the front. I said to him, \'Sergeant!\' But he didn\'t hear me,\r\nbeing busy slanging a secretary--it\'s unfortunate, mon garcon,\' he was\r\nsaying; \'I\'ve told you twenty times that you must send one notice of it\r\nto be carried out by the Squadron Commander, Provost of the C.A., and\r\none by way of advice, without signature, but making mention of the\r\nsignature, to the Provost of the Force Publique d\'Amiens and of the\r\ncenters of the district, of which you have the list--in envelopes, of\r\ncourse, of the general commanding the district. It\'s very simple,\' he\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n"I\'d drawn back three paces to wait till he\'d done with jawing. Five\r\nminutes after, I went up to the sergeant. He said to me, \'My dear sir,\r\nI have not the time to bother with you; I have many other matters to\r\nattend to.\' As a matter of fact, he was all in a flummox in front of\r\nhis typewriter, the chump, because he\'d forgotten, he said, to press on\r\nthe capital-letter lever, and so, instead of underlining the heading of\r\nhis page, he\'d damn well scored a line of 8\'s in the middle of the top.\r\nSo he couldn\'t hear anything, and he played hell with the Americans,\r\nseeing the machine came from there.\r\n\r\n"After that, he growled against another woolly-leg, because on the\r\nmemorandum of the distribution of maps they hadn\'t put the names of the\r\nRation Department, the Cattle Department, and the Administrative Convoy\r\nof the 328th D.I.\r\n\r\n"Alongside, a fool was obstinately trying to pull more circulars off a\r\njellygraph than it would print, doing his damnedest to produce a lot of\r\nghosts that you could hardly read. Others were talking: \'Where are the\r\nParisian fasteners?\' asked a toff. And they don\'t call things by their\r\nproper names: \'Tell me now, if you please, what are the elements\r\nquartered at X--?\' The elements! What\'s all that sort of babble?" asked\r\nVolpatte.\r\n\r\n"At the end of the big table where these fellows were that I\'ve\r\nmentioned and that I\'d been to, and the sergeant floundering about\r\nbehind a hillock of papers at the top of it and giving orders, a\r\nsimpleton was doing nothing but tap on his blotting-pad with his hands.\r\nHis job, the mug, was the department of leave-papers, and as the big\r\npush had begun and all leave was stopped, he hadn\'t anything to\r\ndo--\'Capital!\' he says.\r\n\r\n"And all that, that\'s one table in one room in one department in one\r\ndepot. I\'ve seen more, and then more, and more and more again. I don\'t\r\nknow, but it\'s enough to drive you off your nut, I tell you."\r\n\r\n"Have they got brisques?" [note 2]\r\n\r\n"Not many there, but in the department of the second line every one had\r\n\'em. You had museums of \'em there--whole Zoological Gardens of stripes."\r\n\r\n"Prettiest thing I\'ve seen in the way of stripes," said Tulacque, "was\r\na motorist, dressed in cloth that you\'d have said was satin, with new\r\nstripes, and the leathers of an English officer, though a second-class\r\nsoldier as he was. With his finger on his cheek, he leaned with his\r\nelbows on that fine carriage adorned with windows that he was the valet\r\nde chambre of. He\'d have made you sick, the dainty beast. He was just\r\nexactly the poilu that you see pictures of in the ladies\' papers--the\r\npretty little naughty papers."\r\n\r\nEach has now his memories, his tirade on this much-excogitated subject\r\nof the shirkers, and all begin to overflow and to talk at once. A\r\nhubbub surrounds the foot of the mean wall where we are heaped like\r\nbundles, with a gray, muddy, and trampled spectacle lying before us,\r\nlaid waste by rain.\r\n\r\n"--orderly in waiting to the Road Department, then at the Bakery, then\r\ncyclist to the Revictualing Department of the Eleventh Battery."\r\n\r\n"--every morning he had a note to take to the Service de l\'Intendance,\r\nto the Gunnery School, to the Bridges Department, and in the evening to\r\nthe A.D. and the A.T.--that was all."\r\n\r\n"--when I was coming back from leave,\' said that orderly, \'the women\r\ncheered us at all the level-crossing gates that the train passed.\'\r\n\'They took you for soldiers,\' I said."\r\n\r\n"--\'Ah,\' I said, \'you\'re called up, then, are you?\' \'Certainly,\' he\r\nsays to me, \'considering that I\'ve been a round of meetings in America\r\nwith a Ministerial deputation. P\'raps it\'s not exactly being called up,\r\nthat? Anyway, mon ami,\' he says, \'I don\'t pay any rent, so I must be\r\ncalled up.\' \'And me--\'"\r\n\r\n"To finish," cries Volpatte, silencing the hum with his authority of a\r\ntraveler returned from "down there," "to finish, I saw a whole legion\r\nof \'em all together at a blow-out. For two days I was a sort of helper\r\nin the kitchen of one of the centers of the C.O.A., \'cos they couldn\'t\r\nlet me do nothing while waiting for my reply, which didn\'t hurry,\r\nseeing they\'d sent another inquiry and a super-inquiry after it, and\r\nthe reply had too many halts to make in each office, going and coming.\r\n\r\n"In short, I was cook in the shop. Once I waited at table, seeing that\r\nthe head cook had just got back from leave for the fourth time and was\r\ntired. I saw and I heard those people every time I went into the\r\ndining-room, that was in the Prefecture, and all that hot and\r\nilluminated row got into my head. They were only auxiliaries in there,\r\nbut there were plenty of the armed service among the number, too. They\r\nwere almost all old men, with a few young ones besides, sitting here\r\nand there.\r\n\r\n"I\'d begun to get about enough of it when one of the broomsticks said,\r\n\'The shutters must be closed; it\'s more prudent.\' My boy, they were a\r\nlump of a hundred and twenty-five miles from the firing-line, but that\r\npock-marked puppy he wanted to make believe there was danger of\r\nbombardment by aircraft--"\r\n\r\n"And there\'s my cousin," said Tulacque, fumbling, "who wrote to\r\nme--Look, here\'s what he says: \'Mon cher Adolphe, here I am definitely\r\nsettled in Paris as attache to Guard-Room 60. While you are down there.\r\nI must stay in the capital at the mercy of a Taube or a Zeppelin!\'"\r\n\r\nThe phrase sheds a tranquil delight abroad, and we assimilate it like a\r\ntit-bit, laughing.\r\n\r\n"After that," Volpatte went on, "those layers of soft-jobbers fed me up\r\nstill more. As a dinner it was all right--cod, seeing it was Friday,\r\nbut prepared like soles a la Marguerite--I know all about it. But the\r\ntalk!--"\r\n\r\n"They call the bayonet Rosalie, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the padded luneys. But during dinner these gentlemen talked above\r\nall about themselves. Every one, so as to explain why he wasn\'t\r\nsomewhere else, as good as said (but all the while saying something\r\nelse and gorging like an ogre), \'I\'m ill, I\'m feeble, look at me, ruin\r\nthat I am. Me, I\'m in my dotage.\' They were all seeking inside\r\nthemselves to find diseases to wrap themselves up in--\'I wanted to go\r\nto the war, but I\'ve a rupture, two ruptures, three ruptures.\' Ah, non,\r\nthat feast!--\'The orders that speak of sending everybody away,\'\r\nexplained a funny man, \'they\'re like the comedies,\' he explained,\r\n\'there\'s always a last act to clear up all the jobbery of the others.\r\nThat third act is this paragraph, "Unless the requirements of the\r\nDepartments stand in the way."\' There was one that told this tale, \'I\r\nhad three friends that I counted on to give me a lift up. I was going\r\nto apply to them; but, one after another, a little before I put my\r\nrequest, they were killed by the enemy; look at that,\' he says, \'I\'ve\r\nno luck!\' Another was explaining to another that, as for him, he would\r\nvery much have liked to go, but the surgeon-major had taken him round\r\nthe waist to keep him by force in the depot with the auxiliary. \'Eh\r\nbien,\' he says, \'I resigned myself. After all, I shall be of greater\r\nvalue in putting my intellect to the service of the country than in\r\ncarrying a knapsack.\' And him that was alongside said, \'Oui,\' with his\r\nheadpiece feathered on top. He\'d jolly well consented to go to Bordeaux\r\nat the time when the Boches were getting near Paris, and then Bordeaux\r\nbecame the stylish place; but afterwards he returned firmly to the\r\nfront--to Paris--and said something like this, \'My ability is of value\r\nto France; it is absolutely necessary that I guard it for France.\'\r\n\r\n"They talked about other people that weren\'t there--of the commandant\r\nwho was getting an impossible temper, and they explained that the more\r\nimbecile he got the harsher he got; and the General that made\r\nunexpected inspections with the idea of kicking all the soft-jobbers\r\nout, but who\'d been laid up for eight days, very ill--\'he\'s certainly\r\ngoing to die; his condition no longer gives rise to any uneasiness,\'\r\nthey said, smoking the cigarettes that Society swells send to the\r\ndepots for the soldiers at the front. \'D\'you know,\' they said, \'little\r\nFrazy, who is such a nice boy, the cherub, he\'s at last found an excuse\r\nfor staying behind. They wanted some cattle slaughterers for the\r\nabattoir, and he\'s enlisted himself in there for protection, although\r\nhe\'s got a University degree and in spite of being an attorney\'s clerk.\r\nAs for Flandrin\'s son, he\'s succeeded in getting himself attached to\r\nthe roadmenders.--Roadmender, him? Do you think they\'ll let him stop\r\nso?\' \'Certain sure,\' replies one of the cowardly milksops. \'A\r\nroad-mender\'s job is for a long time.\'\r\n\r\n"Talk about idiots," Marthereau growls.\r\n\r\n"And they were all jealous, I don\'t know why, of a chap called Bourin.\r\nFormerly he moved in the best Parisian circles. He lunched and dined in\r\nthe city. He made eighteen calls a day, and fluttered about the\r\ndrawing-rooms from afternoon tea till daybreak. He was indefatigable in\r\nleading cotillons, organizing festivities, swallowing theatrical shows,\r\nwithout counting the motoring parties, and all the lot running with\r\nchampagne. Then the war came. So he\'s no longer capable, the poor boy,\r\nof staying on the look-out a bit late at an embrasure, or of cutting\r\nwire. He must stay peacefully in the warm. And then, him, a Parisian,\r\nto go into the provinces and bury himself in the trenches! Never in\r\nthis world! \'I realize, too,\' replied an individual, \'that at\r\nthirty-seven I\'ve arrived at the age when I must take care of myself!\'\r\nAnd while the fellow was saying that, I was thinking of Dumont the\r\ngamekeeper, who was forty-two, and was done in close to me on Hill 132,\r\nso near that after he got the handful of bullets in his head, my body\r\nshook with the trembling of his."\r\n\r\n"And what were they like with you, these thieves?"\r\n\r\n"To hell with me, it was, but they didn\'t show it too much, only now\r\nand again when they couldn\'t hold themselves in. They looked at me out\r\nof the corner of their eyes, and took damn good care not to touch me in\r\npassing, for I was still war-mucky.\r\n\r\n"It disgusted me a bit to be in the middle of that heap of\r\ngood-for-nothings, but I said to myself, \'Come, it\'s only for a bit,\r\nFirmin.\' There was just one time that I very near broke out with the\r\nitch, and that was when one of \'em said, \'Later, when we return, if we\r\ndo return.\'--NO! He had no right to say that. Sayings like that, before\r\nyou let them out of your gob, you\'ve got to earn them; it\'s like a\r\ndecoration. Let them get cushy jobs, if they like, but not play at\r\nbeing men in the open when they\'ve damned well run away. And you hear\r\n\'em discussing the battles, for they\'re in closer touch than you with\r\nthe big bugs and with the way the war\'s managed; and afterwards, when\r\nyou return, if you do return, it\'s you that\'ll be wrong in the middle\r\nof all that crowd of humbugs, with the poor little truth that you\'ve\r\ngot.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that evening, I tell you, all those heads in the reek of the\r\nlight, the foolery of those people enjoying life and profiting by\r\npeace! It was like a ballet at the theater or the make-believe of a\r\nmagic lantern. There were--there were--there are a hundred thousand\r\nmore of them," Volpatte at last concluded in confusion.\r\n\r\nBut the men who were paying for the safety of the others with their\r\nstrength and their lives enjoyed the wrath that choked him, that\r\nbrought him to bay in his corner, and overwhelmed him with the\r\napparitions of shirkers.\r\n\r\n"Lucky he doesn\'t start talking about the factory hands who\'ve served\r\ntheir apprenticeship in the war, and all those who\'ve stayed at home\r\nunder the excuse of National Defense, that was put on its feet in five\r\nsecs!" murmured Tirette; "he\'d keep us going with them till Doomsday."\r\n\r\n"You say there are a hundred thousand of them, flea-bite," chaffed\r\nBarque. "Well, in 1914--do you hear me?--Millerand, the War Minister,\r\nsaid to the M.P.\'s, \'There are no shirkers.\'"\r\n\r\n"Millerand!" growled Volpatte. "I tell you, I don\'t know the man; but\r\nif he said that, he\'s a dirty sloven, sure enough!"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"One is always," said Bertrand, "a shirker to some one else."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true; no matter what you call yourself, you\'ll\r\nalways--always--find worse blackguards and better blackguards than\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"All those that never go up to the trenches, or those who never go into\r\nthe first line, and even those who only go there now and then, they\'re\r\nshirkers, if you like to call \'em so, and you\'d see how many there are\r\nif they only gave stripes to the real fighters."\r\n\r\n"There are two hundred and fifty to each regiment of two battalions,"\r\nsaid Cocon.\r\n\r\n"There are the orderlies, and a bit since there were even the servants\r\nof the adjutants."--"The cooks and the under-cooks."--"The\r\nsergeant-majors, and the quartermaster-sergeants, as often as\r\nnot."--"The mess corporals and the mess fatigues."--"Some office-props\r\nand the guard of the colors."--"The baggage-masters." "The drivers, the\r\nlaborers, and all the section, with all its non-coms., and even the\r\nsappers."--"The cyclists." "Not all of them."--"Nearly all the Red\r\nCross service."--"Not the stretcher-bearers, of course; for they\'ve not\r\nonly got a devilish rotten job, but they live with the companies, and\r\nwhen attacks are on they charge with their stretchers; but the hospital\r\nattendants."\r\n\r\n"Nearly all parsons, especially at the rear. For, you know, parsons\r\nwith knapsacks on, I haven\'t seen a devil of a lot of \'em, have you?"\r\n\r\n"Nor me either. In the papers, but not here."\r\n\r\n"There are some, it seems."--"Ah!"\r\n\r\n"Anyway, the common soldier\'s taken something on in this war."\r\n\r\n"There are others that are in the open. We\'re not the only ones."\r\n\r\n"We are!" said Tulacque, sharply; "we\'re almost the only ones!"\r\n\r\nHe added, "You may say--I know well enough what you\'ll tell me--that it\r\nwas the motor lorries and the heavy artillery that brought it off at\r\nVerdun. It\'s true, but they\'ve got a soft job all the same by the side\r\nof us. We\'re always in danger, against their once, and we\'ve got the\r\nbullets and the bombs, too, that they haven\'t. The heavy artillery\r\nreared rabbits near their dug-outs, and they\'ve been making themselves\r\nomelettes for eighteen months. We are really in danger. Those that only\r\nget a bit of it, or only once, aren\'t in it at all. Otherwise,\r\neverybody would be. The nursemaid strolling the streets of Paris would\r\nbe, too, since there are the Taubes and the Zeppelins, as that\r\npudding-head said that the pal was talking about just now."\r\n\r\n"In the first expedition to the Dardanelles, there was actually a\r\nchemist wounded by a shell. You don\'t believe me, but it\'s true all the\r\nsame--an officer with green facings, wounded!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s chance, as I wrote to Mangouste, driver of a remount horse for\r\nthe section, that got wounded--but it was done by a motor lorry."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, it\'s like that. After all, a bomb can tumble down on a\r\npavement, in Paris or in Bordeaux."\r\n\r\n"Oui, oui; so it\'s too easy to say, \'Don\'t let\'s make distinctions in\r\ndanger!\' Wait a bit. Since the beginning, there are some of those\r\nothers who\'ve got killed by an unlucky chance; among us there are some\r\nthat are still alive by a lucky chance. It isn\'t the same thing, that,\r\nseeing that when you\'re dead, it\'s for a long time."\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Tirette, "but you\'re getting too venomous with your stories\r\nof shirkers. As long as we can\'t help it, it\'s time to turn over. I\'m\r\nthinking of a retired forest-ranger at Cherey, where we were last\r\nmonth, who went about the streets of the town spying everywhere to rout\r\nout some civilian of military age, and he smelled out the dodgers like\r\na mastiff. Behold him pulling up in front of a sturdy goodwife that had\r\na mustache, and he only sees her mustache, so he bullyrags her--\'Why\r\naren\'t you at the front, you?\'"\r\n\r\n"For my part," says Pepin, "I don\'t fret myself about the shirkers or\r\nthe semi-shirkers, it\'s wasting one\'s time; but where they get on my\r\nnerves, it\'s when they swank. I\'m of Volpatte\'s opinion. Let \'em shirk,\r\ngood, that\'s human nature; but afterwards they shouldn\'t say, \'I\'ve\r\nbeen a soldier.\' Take the engages, [note 3] for instance--"\r\n\r\n"That depends on the engages. Those who have offered for the infantry\r\nwithout conditions, I look up to those men as much as to those that\r\nhave got killed; but the engages in the departments or special arms,\r\neven in the heavy artillery, they begin to get my back up. We know \'em!\r\nWhen they\'re doing the agreeable in their social circle, they\'ll say,\r\n\'I\'ve offered for the war.\'--\'Ah, what a fine thing you have done; of\r\nyour own free will you have defied the machine-guns! \'--\'Well, yes,\r\nmadame la marquise, I\'m built like that!\' Eh, get out of it, humbug!"\r\n\r\n"Oui, it\'s always the same tale. They wouldn\'t be able to say in the\r\ndrawing-rooms afterwards, \'Tenez, here I am; look at me for a voluntary\r\nengage!\'"\r\n\r\n"I know a gentleman who enlisted in the aerodromes. He had a fine\r\nuniform--he\'d have done better to offer for the Opera-Comique. What am\r\nI saying--\'he\'d have done better?\' He\'d have done a damn sight better,\r\noui. At least he\'d have made other people laugh honestly, instead of\r\nmaking them laugh with the spleen in it."\r\n\r\n"They\'re a lot of cheap china, fresh painted, and plastered with\r\nornaments and all sorts of falderals, but they don\'t go under fire."\r\n\r\n"If there\'d only been people like those, the Boches would be at\r\nBayonne."\r\n\r\n"When war\'s on, one must risk his skin, eh, corporal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bertrand, "there are some times when duty and danger are\r\nexactly the same thing; when the country, when justice and liberty are\r\nin danger, it isn\'t in taking shelter that you defend them. On the\r\ncontrary, war means danger of death and sacrifice of life for\r\neverybody, for everybody; no one is sacred. One must go for it,\r\nupright, right to the end, and not pretend to do it in a fanciful\r\nuniform. These services at the bases, and they\'re necessary, must be\r\nautomatically guaranteed by the really weak and the really old."\r\n\r\n"Besides, there are too many rich and influential people who have\r\nshouted, \'Let us save France!--and begin by saving ourselves!\' On the\r\ndeclaration of war, there was a big rush to get out of it, that\'s what\r\nthere was, and the strongest succeeded. I noticed myself, in my little\r\ncorner, it was especially those that jawed most about patriotism\r\npreviously. Anyway, as the others were saying just now, if they get\r\ninto a funk-hole, the worst filthiness they can do is to make people\r\nbelieve they\'ve run risks. \'Cos those that have really run risks, they\r\ndeserve the same respect as the dead."\r\n\r\n"Well, what then? It\'s always like that, old man; you can\'t change\r\nhuman nature."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be helped. Grouse, complain? Tiens! talking about\r\ncomplaining, did you know Margoulin?"\r\n\r\n"Margoulin? The good sort that was with us, that they left to die at le\r\nCrassier because they thought he was dead?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he wanted to make a complaint. Every day he talked about\r\nprotesting against all those things to the captain and the commandant.\r\nHe\'d say after breakfast, \'I\'ll go and say it as sure as that pint of\r\nwine\'s there.\' And a minute later, \'If I don\'t speak, there\'s never a\r\npint of wine there at all.\' And if you were passing later you\'d hear\r\nhim again, \'Tiens! is that a pint of wine there? Well, you\'ll see if I\r\ndon\'t speak! Result--he said nothing at all. You\'ll say, \'But he got\r\nkilled.\' True, but previously he had God\'s own time to do it two\r\nthousand times if he\'d dared."\r\n\r\n"All that, it makes me ill," growled Blaire, sullen, but with a flash\r\nof fury.\r\n\r\n"We others, we\'ve seen nothing--seeing that we don\'t see anything--but\r\nif we did see--!"\r\n\r\n"Old chap," Volpatte cried, "those depots--take notice of what I\r\nsay--you\'d have to turn the Seine, the Garonne, the Rhone and the Loire\r\ninto them to clean them. In the interval, they\'re living, and they live\r\nwell, and they go to doze peacefully every night, every night!"\r\n\r\nThe soldier held his peace. In the distance he saw the night as they\r\nwould pass it--cramped up, trembling with vigilance in the deep\r\ndarkness, at the bottom of the listening-hole whose ragged jaws showed\r\nin black outline all around whenever a gun hurled its dawn into the sky.\r\n\r\nBitterly said Cocon: "All that, it doesn\'t give you any desire to die."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it does," some one replies tranquilly. "Yes, it does. Don\'t\r\nexaggerate, old kipper-skin."\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1:] Thirty or thirty-one years old in 1914.--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 2:] A-shape badges worn on the left arm to indicate the duration\r\nof service at the front.--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 3:] Soldiers voluntarily enlisted in ordinary times for three,\r\nfour, or five years.

We were ending the day in peace, and\r\nenjoying that idle ease whose happiness one only realizes when one is\r\nreally weary. It was fine weather, we were at the beginning of rest,\r\nand dreaming about it. Evening seemed to make our faces bigger before\r\nit darkened them, and they shone with the serenity of nature.\r\n\r\nSergeant Suilhard came to me, took my arm, and led me away. "Come," he\r\nsaid, "and I\'ll show you something."\r\n\r\nThe approaches to the village abounded in rows of tall and tranquil\r\ntrees, and we followed them along. Under the pressure of the breeze\r\ntheir vast verdure yielded from time to time in slow majestic movements.\r\n\r\nSuilhard went in front of me. He led me into a deep lane, which twisted\r\nabout between high banks; and on each side grew a border of bushes,\r\nwhose tops met each other. For some moments we walked in a bower of\r\ntender green. A last gleam of light, falling aslant across the lane,\r\nmade points of bright yellow among the foliage, and round as gold\r\ncoins. "This is pretty," I said.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, but looked aside and hard. Then he stopped. "It must\r\nbe there."\r\n\r\nHe made me climb up a bit of a track to a field, a great quadrangle\r\nwithin tall trees, and full of the scent of hay.\r\n\r\n"Tiens!" I said, looking at the ground, "it\'s all trampled here;\r\nthere\'s been something to do."\r\n\r\n"Come," said Suilhard to me. He led me into the field, not far from its\r\ngate. There was a group of soldiers there, talking in low voices. My\r\ncompanion stretched out his hand. "It\'s there," he said.\r\n\r\nA very short post, hardly a yard high, was implanted a few paces from\r\nthe hedge, composed just there of young trees. "It was there," he said,\r\n"that they shot a soldier of the 204th this morning. They planted that\r\npost in the night. They brought the chap here at dawn, and these are\r\nthe fellows of his squad who killed him. He tried to dodge the\r\ntrenches. During relief he stayed behind, and then went quietly off to\r\nquarters. He did nothing else; they meant, no doubt, to make an example\r\nof him."\r\n\r\nWe came near to the conversation of the others. "No, no, not at all,"\r\nsaid one. "He wasn\'t a ruffian, he wasn\'t one of those toughs that we\r\nall know. We all enlisted together. He was a decent sort, like\r\nourselves, no more, no less--a bit funky, that\'s all. He was in the\r\nfront line from the beginning, he was, and I\'ve never seen him boozed,\r\nI haven\'t."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but all must be told. Unfortunately for him, there was a\r\n\'previous conviction.\' There were two, you know, that did the\r\ntrick--the other got two years. But Cajard, [note 1] because of the\r\nsentence he got in civil life couldn\'t benefit by extenuating\r\ncircumstances. He\'d done some giddy-goat trick in civil life, when he\r\nwas drunk."\r\n\r\n"You can see a little blood on the ground if you look," said a stooping\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n"There was the whole ceremonial," another went on, "from A to Z--the\r\ncolonel on horseback, the degradation; then they tied him to the little\r\npost, the cattle-stoup. He had to be forced to kneel or sit on the\r\nground with a similar post."\r\n\r\n"It\'s past understanding," said a third, after a silence, "if it wasn\'t\r\nfor the example the sergeant spoke about."\r\n\r\nOn the post the soldiers had scrawled inscriptions and protests. A\r\ncroix de guerre, cut clumsily of wood, was nailed to it, and read: "A.\r\nCajard, mobilized in August, 1914, in gratitude to France."\r\n\r\nReturning to quarters I met Volpatte, still surrounded and talking. He\r\nwas relating some new anecdotes of his journey among the happy ones.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1:] I have altered the name of this soldier as well as that of\r\nthe village.--H. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThe Dog\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE weather was appalling. Water and wind attacked the passers-by;\r\nriddled, flooded, and upheaved the roads.\r\n\r\nI was returning from fatigue to our quarters at the far end of the\r\nvillage. The landscape that morning showed dirty yellow through the\r\nsolid rain, and the sky was dark as a slated roof. The downpour flogged\r\nthe horse-trough as with birchen rods. Along the walls, human shapes\r\nwent in shrinking files, stooping, abashed, splashing.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the rain and the cold and bitter wind, a crowd had gathered\r\nin front of the door of the barn where we were lodging. All close\r\ntogether and back to back, the men seemed from a distance like a great\r\nmoving sponge. Those who could see, over shoulders and between heads,\r\nopened their eyes wide and said, "He has a nerve, the boy!" Then the\r\ninquisitive ones broke away, with red noses and streaming faces, into\r\nthe down-pour that lashed and the blast that bit, and letting the hands\r\nfall that they had upraised in surprise, they plunged them in their\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nIn the center, and running with rain, abode the cause of the\r\ngathering--Fouillade, bare to the waist and washing himself in abundant\r\nwater. Thin as an insect, working his long slender arms in riotous\r\nfrenzy, he soaped and splashed his head, neck, and chest, down to the\r\nupstanding gridirons of his sides. Over his funnel-shaped cheeks the\r\nbrisk activity had spread a flaky beard like snow, and piled on the top\r\nof his head a greasy fleece that the rain was puncturing with little\r\nholes.\r\n\r\nBy way of a tub, the patient was using three mess-tins which he had\r\nfilled with water--no one knew how--in a village where there was none;\r\nand as there was no clean spot anywhere to put anything down in that\r\nuniversal streaming of earth and sky, he thrust his towel into the\r\nwaistband of his trousers, while the soap went back into his pocket\r\nevery time he used it.\r\n\r\nThey who still remained wondered at this heroic gesticulation in the\r\nface of adversity, and said again, as they wagged their heads, "It\'s a\r\ndisease of cleanliness he\'s got."\r\n\r\n"You know he\'s going to be carpeted, they say, for that affair of the\r\nshell-hole with Volpatte." And they mixed the two exploits together in\r\na muddled way, that of the shell-hole, and the present, and looked on\r\nhim as the hero of the moment, while he puffed, sniffled, grunted,\r\nspat, and tried to dry himself under the celestial shower-bath with\r\nrapid rubbing and as a measure of deception; then at last he resumed\r\nhis clothes.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAfter his wash, Fouillade feels cold. He turns about and stands in the\r\ndoorway of the barn that shelters us. The arctic blast discolors and\r\ndisparages his long face, so hollow and sunburned; it draws tears from\r\nhis eyes, and scatters them on the cheeks once scorched by the mistral;\r\nhis nose, too, weeps increasingly.\r\n\r\nYielding to the ceaseless bite of the wind that grips his ears in spite\r\nof the muffler knotted round his head, and his calves in spite of the\r\nyellow puttees with which his cockerel legs are enwound, he reenters\r\nthe barn, but comes out of it again at once, rolling ferocious eyes,\r\nand muttering oaths with the accent one hears in that corner of the\r\nland, over six hundred miles from here, whence he was driven by war.\r\n\r\nSo he stands outside, erect, more truly excited than ever before in\r\nthese northern scenes. And the wind comes and steals into him, and\r\ncomes again roughly, shaking and maltreating his scarecrow\'s slight and\r\nflesh-less figure.\r\n\r\nYe gods! It is almost uninhabitable, the barn they have assigned to us\r\nto live in during this period of rest. It is a collapsing refuge,\r\ngloomy and leaky, confined as a well. One half of it is under water--we\r\nsee rats swimming in it--and the men are crowded in the other half. The\r\nwalls, composed of laths stuck together with dried mud, are cracked,\r\nsunken, holed in all their circuit, and extensively broken through\r\nabove. The night we got here--until the morning--we plugged as well as\r\nwe could the openings within reach, by inserting leafy branches and\r\nhurdles. But the higher holes, and those in the roof, still gaped and\r\nalways. When dawn hovers there, weakling and early, the wind for\r\ncontrast rushes in and blows round every side with all its strength,\r\nand the squad endures the hustling of an everlasting draught.\r\n\r\nWhen we are there, we remain upright in the ruined obscurity, groping,\r\nshivering, complaining.\r\n\r\nFouillade, who has come in once more, goaded by the cold, regrets his\r\nablutions. He has pains in his loins and back. He wants something to\r\ndo, but what?\r\n\r\nSit down? Impossible; it is too dirty inside there. The ground and the\r\npaving-stones are plastered with mud; the straw scattered for our\r\nsleeping is soaked through, by the water that comes through the holes\r\nand by the boots that wipe themselves with it. Besides, if you sit\r\ndown, you freeze; and if you lie on the straw, you are troubled by the\r\nsmell of manure, and sickened by the vapors of ammonia. Fouillade\r\ncontents himself by looking at his place, and yawning wide enough to\r\ndislocate his long jaw, further lengthened by a goatee beard where you\r\nwould see white hairs if the daylight were really daylight.\r\n\r\n"The other pals and boys," said Marthereau, "they\'re no better off than\r\nwe are. After breakfast I went to see a jail-bird of the 11th on the\r\nfarm near the hospital. You\'ve to clamber over a wall by a ladder\r\nthat\'s too short--talk about a scissor-cut!" says Marthereau, who is\r\nshort in the leg; "and when once you\'re in the hen-run and rabbit-hutch\r\nyou\'re shoved and poked by everybody and a nuisance to \'em all. You\r\ndon\'t know where to put your pasties down. I vamoosed from there, and\r\nsharp."\r\n\r\n"For my part," says Cocon, "I wanted to go to the blacksmith\'s when\r\nwe\'d got quit of grubbing, to imbibe something hot, and pay for it.\r\nYesterday he was selling coffee, but some bobbies called there this\r\nmorning, so the good man\'s got the shakes, and he\'s locked his door."\r\n\r\nLamuse has tried to clean his rifle. But one cannot clean his rifle\r\nhere, even if he squats on the ground near the door, nor even if he\r\ntakes away the sodden tent-cloth, hard and icy, which hangs across the\r\ndoorway like a stalactite; it is too dark. "And then, old chap, if you\r\nlet a screw fall, you may as well hang yourself as try to find it,\r\n\'specially when your fists are frozen silly."\r\n\r\n"As for me, I ought to be sewing some things, but--what cheer!"\r\n\r\nOne alternative remains--to stretch oneself on the straw, covering the\r\nhead with handkerchief or towel to isolate it from the searching stench\r\nof fermenting straw, and sleep. Fouillade, master of his time to-day,\r\nbeing on neither guard nor fatigues, decides. He lights a taper to seek\r\namong his belongings, and unwinds the coils of his comforter, and we\r\nsee his emaciated shape, sculptured in black relief, folding and\r\nrefolding it.\r\n\r\n"Potato fatigue, inside there, my little lambs!" a sonorous voice\r\nbellows at the door. The hooded shape from which it comes is Sergeant\r\nHenriot. He is a malignant sort of simpleton, and though all the while\r\njoking in clumsy sympathy he supervises the evacuation of quarters with\r\na sharp eye for the evasive malingerer.\r\n\r\nOutside, on the streaming road in the perpetual rain, the second\r\nsection is scattered, also summoned and driven to work by the adjutant.\r\nThe two sections mingle together. We climb the street and the hillock\r\nof clayey soil where the traveling kitchen is smoking.\r\n\r\n"Now then, my lads, get on with it; it isn\'t a long job when everybody\r\nsets to--Come--what have you got to grumble about, you? That does no\r\ngood."\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later we return at a trot. As we grope about in the\r\nbarn, we cannot touch anything but what is sodden and cold, and the\r\nsour smell of wet animals is added to the vapor of the liquid manure\r\nthat our beds contain.\r\n\r\nWe gather again, standing, around the props that hold the barn up, and\r\naround the rills that fall vertically from the holes in the roof--faint\r\ncolumns which rest on vague bases of splashing water. "Here we are\r\nagain!" we cry.\r\n\r\nTwo lumps in turn block the doorway, soaked with the rain that drains\r\nfrom them--Lamuse and Barque, who have been in quest of a brasier, and\r\nnow return from the expedition empty-handed, sullen and vicious. "Not a\r\nshadow of a fire-bucket, and what\'s more, no wood or coal either, not\r\nfor a fortune." It is impossible to have any fire. "If I can\'t get any,\r\nno one can," says Barque, with a pride which a hundred exploits justify.\r\n\r\nWe stay motionless, or move slowly in the little space we have, aghast\r\nat so much misery. "Whose is the paper?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s mine," says Becuwe.\r\n\r\n"What does it say? Ah, zut, one can\'t read in this darkness!"\r\n\r\n"It says they\'ve done everything necessary now for the soldiers, to\r\nkeep them warm in the trenches. They\'ve got all they want, and blankets\r\nand shirts and brasiers and fire-buckets and bucketsful of coal; and\r\nthat it\'s like that in the first-line trenches."\r\n\r\n"Ah, damnation!" growl some of the poor prisoners of the barn, and they\r\nshake their fists at the emptiness without and at the newspaper itself.\r\n\r\nBut Fouillade has lost interest in what they say. He has bent his long\r\nDon Quixote carcase down in the shadow, and outstretched the lean neck\r\nthat looks as if it were braided with violin strings. There is\r\nsomething on the ground that attracts him.\r\n\r\nIt is Labri, the other squad\'s dog, an uncertain sort of mongrel\r\nsheep-dog, with a lopped tail, curled up on a tiny litter of\r\nstraw-dust. Fouillade looks at Labri, and Labri at him. Becuwe comes up\r\nand says, with the intonation of the Lille district, "He won\'t eat his\r\nfood; the dog isn\'t well. Hey, Labri, what\'s the matter with you?\r\nThere\'s your bread and meat; eat it up; it\'s good when it\'s in your\r\nbucket. He\'s poorly. One of these mornings we shall find him dead."\r\n\r\nLabri is not happy. The soldier to whom he is entrusted is hard on him,\r\nand usually ill-treats him--when he takes any notice of him at all. The\r\nanimal is tied up all day. He is cold and ill and left to himself. He\r\nonly exists. From time to time, when there is movement going on around\r\nhim, he has hopes of going out, rises and stretches himself, and\r\nbestirs his tail to incipient demonstration. But he is disillusioned,\r\nand lies down again, gazing past his nearly full mess-tin.\r\n\r\nHe is weary, and disgusted with life. Even if he has escaped the bullet\r\nor bomb to which he is as much exposed as we, he will end by dying\r\nhere. Fouillade puts his thin hand on the dog\'s head, and it gazes at\r\nhim again. Their two glances are alike--the only difference is that one\r\ncomes from above and the other from below.\r\n\r\nFouillade sits down also--the worse for him!--in a corner, his hands\r\ncovered by the folds of his greatcoat, his long legs doubled up like a\r\nfolding bed. He is dreaming, his eyes closed under their bluish lids;\r\nthere is something that he sees again. It is one of those moments when\r\nthe country from which he is divided assumes in the distance the charms\r\nof reality--the perfumes and colors of l\'Herault, the streets of Cette.\r\nHe sees so plainly and so near that he hears the noise of the shallops\r\nin the Canal du Midi, and the unloading at the docks; and their call to\r\nhim is distinctly clear.\r\n\r\nAbove the road where the scent of thyme and immortelles is so strong\r\nthat it is almost a taste in the mouth, in the heart of the sunshine\r\nwhose winging shafts stir the air into a warmed and scented breeze, on\r\nMont St. Clair, blossoms and flourishes the home of his folks. Up\r\nthere, one can see with the same glance where the Lake of Thau, which\r\nis green like glass, joins hands with the Mediterranean Sea, which is\r\nazure; and sometimes one can make out as well, in the depths of the\r\nindigo sky, the carven phantoms of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThere was he born, there he grew up, happy and free. There he played,\r\non the golden or ruddy ground; played--even--at soldiers. The eager joy\r\nof wielding a wooden saber flushed the cheeks now sunken and seamed. He\r\nopens his eyes, looks about him, shakes his head, and falls upon regret\r\nfor the days when glory and war to him were pure, lofty, and sunny\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe man puts his hand over his eyes, to retain the vision within.\r\nNowadays, it is different.\r\n\r\nIt was up there in the same place, later, that he came to know\r\nClemence. She was just passing, the first time, sumptuous with\r\nsunshine, and so fair that the loose sheaf of straw she carried in her\r\narms seemed to him nut-brown by contrast. The second time, she had a\r\nfriend with her, and they both stopped to watch him. He heard them\r\nwhispering, and turned towards them. Seeing themselves discovered, the\r\ntwo young women made off, with a sibilance of skirts, and giggles like\r\nthe cry of a partridge.\r\n\r\nAnd it was there, too, that he and she together set up their home. Over\r\nits front travels a vine, which he coddled under a straw hat, whatever\r\nthe season. By the garden gate stands the rose-tree that he knows so\r\nwell--it never used its thorns except to try to hold him back a little\r\nas he went by.\r\n\r\nWill he return again to it all? Ah, he has looked too deeply into the\r\nprofundity of the past not to see the future in appalling accuracy. He\r\nthinks of the regiment, decimated at each shift; of the big knocks and\r\nhard he has had and will have, of sickness, and of wear--\r\n\r\nHe gets up and snorts, as though to shake off what was and what will\r\nbe. He is back in the middle of the gloom, and is frozen and swept by\r\nthe wind, among the scattered and dejected men who blindly await the\r\nevening. He is back in the present, and he is shivering still.\r\n\r\nTwo paces of his long legs make him butt into a group that is\r\ntalking--by way of diversion or consolation--of good cheer.\r\n\r\n"At my place," says one, "they make enormous loaves, round ones, big as\r\ncart-wheels they are!" And the man amuses himself by opening his eyes\r\nwide, so that he can see the loaves of the homeland.\r\n\r\n"Where I come from," interposes the poor Southerner, "holiday feasts\r\nlast so long that the bread that\'s new at the beginning is stale at the\r\nend!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s a jolly wine--it doesn\'t look much, that little wine where I\r\ncome from; but if it hasn\'t fifteen degrees of alcohol it hasn\'t\r\nanything!"\r\n\r\nFouillade speaks then of a red wine which is almost violet, which\r\nstands dilution as well as if it had been brought into the world to\r\nthat end.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got the jurancon wine," said a Bearnais, "the real thing, not\r\nwhat they sell you for jurancon, which comes from Paris; indeed, I know\r\none of the makers."\r\n\r\n"If it comes to that," said Fouillade, "in our country we\'ve got\r\nmuscatels of every sort, all the colors of the rainbow, like patterns\r\nof silk stuff. You come home with me some time, and every day you shall\r\ntaste a nonsuch, my boy."\r\n\r\n"Sounds like a wedding feast," said the grateful soldier.\r\n\r\nSo it comes about that Fouillade is agitated by the vinous memories\r\ninto which he has plunged, which recall to him as well the dear perfume\r\nof garlic on that far-off table. The vapors of the blue wine in big\r\nbottles, and the liqueur wines so delicately varied, mount to his head\r\namid the sluggish and mournful storm that fills the barn.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he calls to mind that there is settled in the village where\r\nthey are quartered a tavern-keeper who is a native of Beziers, called\r\nMagnac. Magnac had said to him, "Come and see me, mon camarade, one of\r\nthese mornings, and we\'ll drink some wine from down there, we will!\r\nI\'ve several bottles of it, and you shall tell me what you think of it."\r\n\r\nThis sudden prospect dazzles Fouillade. Through all his length runs a\r\nthrill of delight, as though he had found the way of salvation. Drink\r\nthe wine of the South--of his own particular South, even--drink much of\r\nit--it would be so good to see life rosy again, if only for a day! Ah\r\nyes, he wants wine; and he gets drunk in a dream.\r\n\r\nBut as he goes out he collides at the entry with Corporal Broyer, who\r\nis running down the street like a peddler, and shouting at every\r\nopening, "Morning parade!"\r\n\r\nThe company assembles and forms in squares on the sticky mound where\r\nthe traveling kitchen is sending soot into the rain. "I\'ll go and have\r\na drink after parade," says Fouillade to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd he listens listlessly, full of his plan, to the reading of the\r\nreport. But carelessly as he listens, he hears the officer read, "It is\r\nabsolutely forbidden to leave quarters before 5 p.m. and after 8 p.m.,"\r\nand he hears the captain, without noticing the murmur that runs round\r\nthe poilus, add this comment on the order: "This is Divisional\r\nHeadquarters. However many there are of you, don\'t show yourselves.\r\nKeep under cover. If the General sees you in the street, he will have\r\nyou put to fatigues at once. He must not see a single soldier. Stay\r\nwhere you are all day in your quarters. Do what you like as long as no\r\none sees you--no one!"\r\n\r\nWe go back into the barn.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nTwo o\'clock. It is three hours yet, and then it will be totally dark,\r\nbefore one may risk going outside without being punished.\r\n\r\nShall we sleep while waiting? Fouillade is sleepy no longer; the hope\r\nof wine has shaken him up. And then, if one sleeps in the day, he will\r\nnot sleep at night. No! To lie with your eyes open is worse than a\r\nnightmare. The weather gets worse; wind and rain increase, without and\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nThen what? If one may not stand still, nor sit down, nor lie down, nor\r\ngo for a stroll, nor work--what?\r\n\r\nDeepening misery settles on the party of benumbed and tired soldiers.\r\nThey suffer to the bone, nor know what to do with their bodies. "Nom de\r\nDieu, we\'re badly off!" is the cry of the derelicts--a lamentation, an\r\nappeal for help.\r\n\r\nThen by instinct they give themselves up to the only occupation\r\npossible to them in there--to walk up and down on the spot, and thus\r\nward off anchylosis.\r\n\r\nSo they begin to walk quickly to and fro in the scanty place that three\r\nstrides might compass; they turn about and cross and brush each other,\r\nbent forward, hands pocketed--tramp, tramp. These human beings whom the\r\nblast cuts even among their straw are like a crowd of the wretched\r\nwrecks of cities who await, under the lowering sky of winter, the\r\nopening of some charitable institution. But no door will open for\r\nthem--unless it be four days hence, one evening at the end of the rest,\r\nto return to the trenches.\r\n\r\nAlone in a corner, Cocon cowers. He is tormented by lice; but weakened\r\nby the cold and wet he has not the pluck to change his linen; and he\r\nsits there sullen, unmoving--and devoured.\r\n\r\nAs five o\'clock draws near, in spite of all, Fouillade begins again to\r\nintoxicate himself with his dream of wine, and he waits, with its gleam\r\nin his soul. What time is it?--A quarter to five.--Five minutes to\r\nfive.--Now!\r\n\r\nHe is outside in black night. With great splashing skips he makes his\r\nway towards the tavern of Magnac, the generous and communicative\r\nBiterrois. Only with great trouble does he find the door in the dark\r\nand the inky rain. By God, there is no light! Great God again, it is\r\nclosed! The gleam of a match that his great lean hand covers like a\r\nlamp-shade shows him the fateful notice--"Out of Bounds." Magnac,\r\nguilty of some transgression, has been banished into gloom and idleness!\r\n\r\nFouillade turns his back on the tavern that has become the prison of\r\nits lonely keeper. He will not give up his dream. He will go somewhere\r\nelse and have vin ordinaire, and pay for it, that\'s all. He puts his\r\nhand in his pocket to sound his purse; it is there. There ought to be\r\nthirty-seven sous in it, which will not run to the wine of Prou, but--\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he starts, stops dead, and smites himself on the forehead.\r\nHis long-drawn face is contracted in a frightful grimace, masked by the\r\nnight. No, he no longer has thirty-seven sous, fool that he is! He has\r\nforgotten the tin of sardines that he bought the night before--so\r\ndisgusting did he find the dark macaroni of the soldiers\' mess--and the\r\ndrinks he stood to the cobbler who put him some nails in his boots.\r\n\r\nMisery! There could not be more than thirteen sous left!\r\n\r\nTo get as elevated as one ought, and to avenge himself on the life of\r\nthe moment, he would certainly need--damn\'ation--a liter and a half, In\r\nthis place, a liter of red ordinary costs twenty-one sous. It won\'t go.\r\n\r\nHis eyes wander around him in the darkness, looking for some one.\r\nPerhaps there is a pal somewhere who will lend him money, or stand him\r\na liter.\r\n\r\nBut who--who? Not Becuwe, he has only a marraine [note 1:] who sends\r\nhim tobacco and note-paper every fortnight. Not Barque, who would not\r\ntoe the line; nor Blaire, the miser--he wouldn\'t understand. Not\r\nBiquet, who seems to have something against him; nor Pepin who himself\r\nbegs, and never pays, even when he is host. Ah, if Volpatte were there!\r\nThere is Mesnil Andre, but he is actually in debt to Fouillade on\r\naccount of several drinks round. Corporal Bertrand? Following on a\r\nremark of Fouillade\'s, Bertrand told him to go to the devil, and now\r\nthey look at each other sideways. Farfadet? Fouillade hardly speaks a\r\nword to him in the ordinary way. No, he feels that he cannot ask this\r\nof Farfadet. And then--a thousand thunders!--what is the use of seeking\r\nsaviors in one\'s imagination? Where are they, all these people, at this\r\nhour?\r\n\r\nSlowly he goes back towards the barn. Then mechanically he turns and\r\ngoes forward again, with hesitating steps. He will try, all the same.\r\nPerhaps he can find convivial comrades. He approaches the central part\r\nof the village just when night has buried the earth.\r\n\r\nThe lighted doors and windows of the taverns shine again in the mud of\r\nthe main street. There are taverns every twenty paces. One dimly sees\r\nthe heavy specters of soldiers, mostly in groups, descending the\r\nstreet. When a motor-car comes along, they draw aside to let it pass,\r\ndazzled by the head-lights, and bespattered by the liquid mud that the\r\nwheels hurl over the whole width of the road.\r\n\r\nThe taverns are full. Through the steamy windows one can see they are\r\npacked with compact clouds of helmeted men. Fouillade goes into one or\r\ntwo, on chance. Once over the threshold, the dram-shop\'s tepid breath,\r\nthe light, the smell and the hubbub, affect him with longing. This\r\ngathering at tables is at least a fragment of the past in the present.\r\n\r\nHe looks from table to table, and disturbs the groups as he goes up to\r\nscrutinize all the merrymakers in the room. Alas, he knows no one!\r\nElsewhere, it is the same; he has no luck. In vain he has extended his\r\nneck and sent his desperate glances in search of a familiar head among\r\nthe uniformed men who in clumps or couples drink and talk or in\r\nsolitude write. He has the air of a cadger, and no one pays him heed.\r\n\r\nFinding no soul to come to his relief, he decides to invest at least\r\nwhat he has in his pocket. He slips up to the counter. "A pint of\r\nwine--and good."\r\n\r\n"White?"\r\n\r\n"Eh, oui."\r\n\r\n"You, mon garcon, you\'re from the South," says the landlady, handing\r\nhim a little full bottle and a glass, and gathering his twelve sous.\r\n\r\nHe places himself at the corner of a table already overcrowded by four\r\ndrinkers who are united in a game of cards. He fills the glass to the\r\nbrim and empties it, then fills it again.\r\n\r\n"Hey, good health to you! Don\'t drink the tumbler!" yelps in his face a\r\nman who arrives in the dirty blue jumper of fatigues, and displays a\r\nheavy cross-bar of eyebrows across his pale face, a conical head, and\r\nhalf a pound\'s weight of ears. It is Harlingue, the armorer.\r\n\r\nIt is not very glorious to be seated alone before a pint in the\r\npresence of a comrade who gives signs of thirst. But Fouillade pretends\r\nnot to understand the requirements of the gentleman who dallies in\r\nfront of him with an engaging smile, and he hurriedly empties his\r\nglass. The other turns his back, not without grumbling that "they\'re\r\nnot very generous, but on the contrary greedy, these Southerners."\r\n\r\nFouillade has put his chin on his fists, and looks unseeing at a corner\r\nof the room where the crowded poilus elbow, squeeze, and jostle each\r\nother to get by.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty good, that swig of white wine, but of what use are those\r\nfew drops in the Sahara of Fouillade? The blues did not far recede, and\r\nnow they return.\r\n\r\nThe Southerner rises and goes out, with his two glasses of wine in his\r\nstomach and one sou in his pocket. He plucks up courage to visit one\r\nmore tavern, to plumb it with his eyes, and by way of excuse to mutter,\r\nas he leaves the place, "Curse him! He\'s never there, the animal!"\r\n\r\nThen he returns to the barn, which still--as always--whistles with wind\r\nand water. Fouillade lights his candle, and by the glimmer of the flame\r\nthat struggles desperately to take wing and fly away, he sees Labri. He\r\nstoops low, with his light over the miserable dog--perhaps it will die\r\nfirst. Labri is sleeping, but feebly, for he opens an eye at once, and\r\nhis tail moves.\r\n\r\nThe Southerner strokes him, and says to him in a low voice, "It can\'t\r\nbe helped, it--" He will not say more to sadden him, but the dog\r\nsignifies appreciation by jerking his head before closing his eyes\r\nagain. Fouillade rises stiffly, by reason of his rusty joints, and\r\nmakes for his couch. For only one thing more he is now hoping--to\r\nsleep, that the dismal day may die, that wasted day, like so many\r\nothers that there will be to endure stoically and to overcome, before\r\nthe last day arrives of the war or of his life.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1:] French soldiers have extensively developed a system of\r\ncorresponding with French women whom they do not know from Eve and\r\nwhose acquaintance they usually make through newspaper advertisements.\r\nAs typical of the latter I copy the following: "Officier artilleur, 30\r\nans, desire correspondance discrete avec jeune marraine, femme du\r\nmonde. Ecrire," etc. The "lonely soldier" movement in this country is\r\nsimilar.--Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe Doorway\r\n\r\n\r\n"IT\'s foggy. Would you like to go?"\r\n\r\nIt is Poterloo who asks, as he turns towards me and shows eyes so blue\r\nthat they make his fine, fair head seem transparent.\r\n\r\nPoterloo comes from Souchez, and now that the Chasseurs have at last\r\nretaken it, he wants to see again the village where he lived happily in\r\nthe days when he was only a man.\r\n\r\nIt is a pilgrimage of peril; not that we should have far to go--Souchez\r\nis just there. For six months we have lived and worked in the trenches\r\nalmost within hail of the village. We have only to climb straight from\r\nhere on to the Bethune road along which the trench creeps, the road\r\nhoneycombed underneath by our shelters, and descend it for four or five\r\nhundred yards as it dips down towards Souchez. But all that ground is\r\nunder regular and terrible attention. Since their recoil, the Germans\r\nhave constantly sent huge shells into it. Their thunder shakes us in\r\nour caverns from time to time, and we see, high above the scarps, now\r\nhere now there, the great black geysers of earth and rubbish, and the\r\npiled columns of smoke, as high as churches. Why do they bombard\r\nSouchez? One cannot say why, for there is no longer anybody or anything\r\nin the village so often taken and retaken, that we have so fiercely\r\nwrested from each other.\r\n\r\nBut this morning a dense fog enfolds us, and by favor of the great\r\ncurtain that the sky throws over the earth one might risk it. We are\r\nsure at least of not being seen. The fog hermetically closes the\r\nperfected retina of the Sausage that must be somewhere up there,\r\nenshrouded in the white wadding that raises its vast wall of partition\r\nbetween our lines and those observation posts of Lens and Angres,\r\nwhence the enemy spies upon us.\r\n\r\n"Right you are!" I say to Poterloo.\r\n\r\nAdjutant Barthe, informed of our project, wags his head up and down,\r\nand lowers his eyelids in token that he does not see.\r\n\r\nWe hoist ourselves out of the trench, and behold us both, upright, on\r\nthe Bethune road!\r\n\r\nIt is the first time I have walked there during the day. I have never\r\nseen it, except from afar, the terrible road that we have so often\r\ntraveled or crossed in leaps, bowed down in the darkness, and under the\r\nwhistling of missiles.\r\n\r\n"Well, are you coming, old man?"\r\n\r\nAfter some paces, Poterloo has stopped in the middle of the road, where\r\nthe fog like cotton-wool unravels itself into pendent fragments, and\r\nthere he dilates his sky-blue eyes and half opens his scarlet mouth.\r\n\r\n"Ah, la, la! Ah, la, la!" he murmurs. When I turn to him he points to\r\nthe road, shakes his head and says, "This is it, Bon Dieu, to think\r\nthis is it! This bit where we are, I know it so well that if I shut my\r\neyes I can see it as it was, exactly. Old chap, it\'s awful to see it\r\nagain like that. It was a beautiful road, planted all the way along\r\nwith big trees.\r\n\r\n"And now, what is it? Look at it--a sort of long thing without a\r\nsoul--sad, sad. Look at these two trenches on each side, alive; this\r\nripped-up paving, bored with funnels; these trees uprooted, split,\r\nscorched, broken like faggots, thrown all ways, pierced by\r\nbullets--look, this pock-marked pestilence, here! Ah, my boy, my boy,\r\nyou can\'t imagine how it is disfigured, this road!" And he goes\r\nforward, seeing some new amazement at every step.\r\n\r\nIt is a fantastic road enough, in truth. On both sides of it are\r\ncrouching armies, and their missiles have mingled on it for a year and\r\na half. It is a great disheveled highway, traveled only by bullets and\r\nby ranks and files of shells, that have furrowed and upheaved it,\r\ncovered it with the earth of the fields, scooped it and laid bare its\r\nbones. It might be under a curse; it is a way of no color, burned and\r\nold, sinister and awful to see.\r\n\r\n"If you\'d only known it--how clean and smooth it was!" says Poterloo.\r\n"All sorts of trees were there, and leaves, and colors--like\r\nbutterflies; and there was always some one passing on it to give\r\ngood-day to some good woman rocking between two baskets, or people\r\nshouting [note 1] to each other in a chaise, with the good wind\r\nballooning their smocks. Ah, how happy life was once on a time!"\r\n\r\nHe dives down to the banks of the misty stream that follows the roadway\r\ntowards the land of parapets. Stooping, he stops by some faint\r\nswellings of the ground on which crosses are fixed--tombs, recessed at\r\nintervals into the wall of fog, like the Stations of the Cross in a\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nI call him--we shall never get there at such a funeral pace. Allons!\r\n\r\nWe come to a wide depression in the land, I in front and Poterloo\r\nlagging behind, his head confused and heavy with thought as he tries in\r\nvain to exchange with inanimate things his glances of recognition. Just\r\nthere the road is lower, a fold secretes it from the side towards the\r\nnorth. On this sheltered ground there is a little traffic.\r\n\r\nAlong the hazy, filthy, and unwholesome space, where withered grass is\r\nembedded in black mud, there are rows of dead. They are carried there\r\nwhen the trenches or the plain are cleared during the night. They are\r\nwaiting--some of them have waited long--to be taken back to the\r\ncemeteries after dark.\r\n\r\nWe approach them slowly. They are close against each other, and each\r\none indicates with arms or legs some different posture of stiffened\r\nagony. There are some with half-moldy faces, the skin rusted, or yellow\r\nwith dark spots. Of several the faces are black as tar, the lips hugely\r\ndistended--the heads of negroes blown out in goldbeaters\' skin. Between\r\ntwo bodies, protruding uncertainly from one or the other, is a severed\r\nwrist, ending with a cluster of strings.\r\n\r\nOthers are shapeless larvae of pollution, with dubious items of\r\nequipment pricking up, or bits of bone. Farther on, a corpse has been\r\nbrought in in such a state that they have been obliged--so as not to\r\nlose it on the way--to pile it on a lattice of wire which was then\r\nfastened to the two ends of a stake. Thus was it carried in the hollow\r\nof its metal hammock, and laid there. You cannot make out either end of\r\nthe body; alone, in the heap that it makes, one recognizes the gape of\r\na trouser-pocket. An insect goes in and out of it.\r\n\r\nAround the dead flutter letters that have escaped from pockets or\r\ncartridge pouches while they were being placed on the ground. Over one\r\nof these bits of white paper, whose wings still beat though the mud\r\nensnares them, I stoop slightly and read a sentence--"My dear Henry,\r\nwhat a fine day it is for your birthday!" The man is on his belly; his\r\nloins are rent from hip to hip by a deep furrow; his head is half\r\nturned round; we see a sunken eye; and on temples, cheek and neck a\r\nkind of green moss is growing.\r\n\r\nA sickening atmosphere roams with the wind around these dead and the\r\nheaped-up debris, that lies about them--tent-cloth or clothing in\r\nstained tatters, stiff with dried blood, charred by the scorch of the\r\nshell, hardened, earthy and already rotting, quick with swarming and\r\nquesting things. It troubles us. We look at each other and shake our\r\nheads, nor dare admit aloud that the place smells bad. All the same, we\r\ngo away slowly.\r\n\r\nNow come breaking out of the fog the bowed backs of men who are joined\r\ntogether by something they are carrying. They are Territorial\r\nstretcher-bearers with a new corpse. They come up with their old wan\r\nfaces, toiling, sweating, and grimacing with the effort. To carry a\r\ndead man in the lateral trenches when they are muddy is a work almost\r\nbeyond human power. They put down the body, which is dressed in new\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not long since, now, that he was standing," says one of the\r\nbearers. "It\'s two hours since he got his bullet in the head for going\r\nto look for a Boche rifle in the plain. He was going on leave on\r\nWednesday and wanted to take a rifle home with him. He is a sergeant of\r\nthe 405th, Class 1914. A nice lad, too."\r\n\r\nHe takes away the handkerchief that is over the face. It is quite\r\nyoung, and seems to sleep, except that an eyeball has gone, the cheek\r\nlooks waxen, and a rosy liquid has run over the nostrils, mouth, and\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe body strikes a note of cleanliness in the charnel-house, this still\r\npliant body that lolls its head aside when it is moved as if to lie\r\nbetter; it gives a childish illusion of being less dead than the\r\nothers. But being less disfigured, it seems more pathetic, nearer to\r\none, more intimate, as we look. And had we said anything in the\r\npresence of all that heap of beings destroyed, it would have been "Poor\r\nboy!"\r\n\r\nWe take the road again, which at this point begins to slope down to the\r\ndepth where Souchez lies. Under our feet in the whiteness of the fog it\r\nappears like a valley of frightful misery. The piles of rubbish, of\r\nremains and of filthiness accumulate on the shattered spine of the\r\nroad\'s paving and on its miry borders in final confusion. The trees\r\nbestrew the ground or have disappeared, torn away, their stumps\r\nmangled. The banks of the road are overturned and overthrown by\r\nshell-fire. All the way along, on both sides of this highway where only\r\nthe crosses remain standing, are trenches twenty times blown in and\r\nre-hollowed, cavities--some with passages into them--hurdles on\r\nquagmires.\r\n\r\nThe more we go forward, the more is everything turned terribly inside\r\nout, full of putrefaction, cataclysmic. We walk on a surface of shell\r\nfragments, and the foot trips on them at every step. We go among them\r\nas if they were snares, and stumble in the medley of broken weapons or\r\nbits of kitchen utensils, of water-bottles, fire-buckets,\r\nsewing-machines, among the bundles of electrical wiring, the French and\r\nGerman accouterments all mutilated and encrusted in dried mud, and\r\namong the sinister piles of clothing, stuck together with a\r\nreddish-brown cement. And one must look out, too, for the unexploded\r\nshells, which everywhere protrude their noses or reveal their flanks or\r\ntheir bases, painted red, blue, and tawny brown.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the old Boche trench, that they cleared out of in the end." It\r\nis choked up in some places, in others riddled with shell-holes. The\r\nsandbags have been torn asunder and gutted; they are crumbled, emptied,\r\nscattered to the wind. The wooden props and beams arc splintered, and\r\npoint all ways. The dug-outs are filled to the brim with earth and\r\nwith--no one knows what. It is all like the dried bed of a river,\r\nsmashed, extended, slimy, that both water and men have abandoned. In\r\none place the trench has been simply wiped out by the guns. The wide\r\nfosse is blocked, and remains no more than a field of new-turned earth,\r\nmade of holes symmetrically bored side by side, in length and in\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nI point out to Poterloo this extraordinary field, that would seem to\r\nhave been traversed by a giant plow. But he is absorbed to his very\r\nvitals in the metamorphosis of the country\'s face.\r\n\r\nHe indicates a space in the plain with his finger, and with a stupefied\r\nair, as though he came out of a dream--"The Red Tavern!" It is a flat\r\nfield, carpeted with broken bricks.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that, there? A milestone? No, it is not a milestone. It is\r\na head, a black head, tanned and polished. The mouth is all askew, and\r\nyou can see something of the mustache bristling on each side--the great\r\nhead of a carbonized cat. The corpse--it is German--is underneath,\r\nburied upright.\r\n\r\n"And that?" It is a ghastly collection containing an entirely white\r\nskull, and then, six feet away, a pair of boots, and between the two a\r\nheap of frayed leather and of rags, cemented by brown mud.\r\n\r\n"Come on, there\'s less fog already. We must hurry."\r\n\r\nA hundred yards in front of us, among the more transparent waves of fog\r\nthat are changing places with us and hide us less and less, a shell\r\nwhistles and bursts. It has fallen in the spot we are just nearing. We\r\nare descending, and the gradient is less steep. We go side by side. My\r\ncompanion says nothing, but looks to right and to left. Then he stops\r\nagain, as he did at the top of the road. I hear his faltering voice,\r\nalmost inaudible--"What\'s this! We\'re there--this is it--"\r\n\r\nIn point of fact we have not left the plain, the vast plain, seared and\r\nbarren--but we are in Souchez!\r\n\r\nThe village has disappeared, nor have I seen a village go so\r\ncompletely. Ablain-Saint-Nazaire, and Carency, these still retained\r\nsome shape of a place, with their collapsed and truncated houses, their\r\nyards heaped high with plaster and tiles. Here, within the framework of\r\nslaughtered trees that surrounds us as a spectral background in the\r\nfog, there is no longer any shape. There is not even an end of wall,\r\nfence, or porch that remains standing; and it amazes one to discover\r\nthat there are paving-stones under the tangle of beams, stones, and\r\nscrap-iron. This--here--was a street.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a dirty and boggy waste near a big town, whose\r\nrubbish of demolished buildings and its domestic refuse had been shot\r\nhere for years, till no spot was empty. We plunge into a uniform layer\r\nof dung and debris, and make but slow and difficult progress. The\r\nbombardment has so changed the face of things that it has diverted the\r\ncourse of the millstream, which now runs haphazard and forms a pond on\r\nthe remains of the little place where the cross stood.\r\n\r\nHere are several shell-holes where swollen horses are rotting; in\r\nothers the remains of what were once human beings are scattered,\r\ndistorted by the monstrous injury of shells.\r\n\r\nHere, athwart the track we are following, that we ascend as through an\r\navalanche or inundation of ruin, under the unbroken melancholy of the\r\nsky, here is a man stretched out as if he slept, but he has that close\r\nflattening against the ground which distinguishes a dead man from a\r\nsleeper. He is a dinner-fatigue man, with a chaplet of loaves threaded\r\nover a belt, and a bunch of his comrades\' water-bottles slung on his\r\nshoulder by a skein of straps. It must have been only last night that\r\nthe fragment of a shell caught him in the back. No doubt we are the\r\nfirst to find him, this unknown soldier secretly dead. Perhaps he will\r\nbe scattered before others find him, so we look for his identity\r\ndisc--it is stuck in the clotted blood where his right hand stagnates.\r\nI copy down the name that is written in letters of blood.\r\n\r\nPoterloo lets me do it by myself--he is like a sleepwalker. He looks,\r\nand looks in despair, everywhere. He seeks endlessly among those\r\nevanished and eviscerated things; through the void he gazes to the haze\r\nof the horizon. Then he sits down on a beam, having first sent flying\r\nwith a kick a saucepan that lay on it, and I sit by his side. A light\r\ndrizzle is falling. The fog\'s moisture is resolving in little drops\r\nthat cover everything with a slight gloss. He murmurs, "Ah, la, la!"\r\n\r\nHe wipes his forehead and raises imploring eyes to me. He is trying to\r\nmake out and take in the destruction of all this corner of the earth,\r\nand the mournfulness of it. He stammers disjointed remarks and\r\ninterjections. He takes off his great helmet and his head is smoking.\r\nThen he says to me with difficulty, "Old man, you cannot imagine, you\r\ncannot, you cannot--"\r\n\r\nHe whispers: "The Red Tavern, where that--where that Boche\'s head is,\r\nand litters of beastliness all around, that sort of cesspool--it was on\r\nthe edge of the road, a brick house and two out-buildings\r\nalongside--how many times, old man, on the very spot where we stood,\r\nhow many times, there, the good woman who joked with me on her\r\ndoorstep, I\'ve given her good-day as I wiped my mouth and looked\r\ntowards Souchez that I was going back to! And then, after a few steps,\r\nI\'ve turned round to shout some nonsense to her! Oh, you cannot\r\nimagine! But that, now, that!" He makes an inclusive gesture to\r\nindicate all the emptiness that surrounds him.\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t stay here too long, old chap. The fog\'s lifting, you know."\r\n\r\nHe stands up with an effort--"Allons."\r\n\r\nThe most serious part is yet to come. His house--\r\n\r\nHe hesitates, turns towards the east, goes. "It\'s there--no, I\'ve\r\npassed it. It\'s not there. I don\'t know where it is--or where it was.\r\nAh, misery, misery!" He wrings his hands in despair and staggers in the\r\nmiddle of the medley of plaster and bricks. Then, bewildered by this\r\nencumbered plain of lost landmarks, he looks questioningly about in the\r\nair, like a thoughtless child, like a madman. He is looking for the\r\nintimacy of the bedrooms scattered in infinite space, for their inner\r\nform and their twilight now cast upon the winds!\r\n\r\nAfter several goings and comings, he stops at one spot and draws back a\r\nlittle--"It was there, I\'m right. Look--it\'s that stone there that I\r\nknew it by. There was a vent-hole there, you can see the mark of the\r\nbar of iron that was over the hole before it disappeared."\r\n\r\nSniffling he reflects, and gently shaking his head as though he could\r\nnot stop it: "It is when you no longer have anything that you\r\nunderstand how happy you were. Ah, how happy we were!"\r\n\r\nHe comes up to me and laughs nervously: "It\'s out of the common, that,\r\neh? I\'m sure you\'ve never seen yourself like it--can\'t find the house\r\nwhere you\'ve always lived since--since always--"\r\n\r\nHe turns about, and it is he who leads me away:\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s leg it, since there is nothing. Why spend a whole hour\r\nlooking at places where things were? Let\'s be off, old man."\r\n\r\nWe depart--the only two living beings to be seen in that unreal and\r\nmiasmal place, that village which bestrews the earth and lies under our\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWe climb again. The weather is clearing and the fog scattering quickly.\r\nMy silent comrade, who is making great strides with lowered head,\r\npoints out a field: "The cemetery," he says; "it was there before it\r\nwas everywhere, before it laid hold on everything without end, like a\r\nplague."\r\n\r\nHalf-way, we go more slowly, and Poterloo comes close to me-"You know,\r\nit\'s too much, all that. It\'s wiped out too much--all my life up to\r\nnow. It makes me afraid--it is so completely wiped out."\r\n\r\n"Come; your wife\'s in good health, you know; your little girl, too."\r\n\r\nHe looks at me comically: "My wife--I\'ll tell you something; my wife--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, old chap, I\'ve seen her again."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve seen her? I thought she was in the occupied country?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s at Lens, with my relations. Well, I\'ve seen her--ah, and\r\nthen, after all, zut!--I\'ll tell you all about it. Well, I was at Lens,\r\nthree weeks ago. It was the eleventh; that\'s twenty days since."\r\n\r\nI look at him, astounded. But he looks like one who is speaking the\r\ntruth. He talks in sputters at my side, as we walk in the increasing\r\nlight--\r\n\r\n"They told us--you remember, perhaps--but you weren\'t there, I\r\nbelieve--they told us the wire had got to be strengthened in front of\r\nthe Billard Trench. You know what that means, eh? They hadn\'t been able\r\nto do it till then. As soon as one gets out of the trench he\'s on a\r\ndownward slope, that\'s got a funny name."\r\n\r\n"The Toboggan."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it; and the place is as bad by night or in fog as in broad\r\ndaylight, because of the rifles trained on it before hand on trestles,\r\nand the machine-guns that they point during the day. When they can\'t\r\nsee any more, the Boches sprinkle the lot.\r\n\r\n"They took the pioneers of the C.H.R., but there were some missing, and\r\nthey replaced \'em with a few poilus. I was one of \'em. Good. We climb\r\nout. Not a single rifle-shot! \'What does it mean?\' we says, and behold,\r\nwe see a Boche, two Boches, three Boches, coming out of the ground--the\r\ngray devils!--and they make signs to us and shout \'Kamarad!\' \'We\'re\r\nAlsatians,\' they says, coming more and more out of their communication\r\ntrench--the International. \'They won\'t fire on you, up there,\' they\r\nsays; \'don\'t be afraid, friends. Just let us bury our dead.\' And behold\r\nus working aside of each other, and even talking together since they\r\nwere from Alsace. And to tell the truth, they groused about the war and\r\nabout their officers. Our sergeant knew all right that it was forbidden\r\nto talk with the enemy, and they\'d even read it out to us that we were\r\nonly to talk to them with our rifles. But the sergeant he says to\r\nhimself that this is God\'s own chance to strengthen the wire, and as\r\nlong as they were letting us work against them, we\'d just got to take\r\nadvantage of it.\r\n\r\n"Then behold one of the Boches that says, \'There isn\'t perhaps one of\r\nyou that comes from the invaded country and would like news of his\r\nfamily?\'\r\n\r\n"Old chap, that was a bit too much for me. Without thinking if I did\r\nright or wrong, I went up to him and I said, \'Yes, there\'s me.\' The\r\nBoche asks me questions. I tell him my wife\'s at Lens with her\r\nrelations, and the little one, too. He asks where she\'s staying. I\r\nexplain to him, and he says he can see it from there. \'Listen,\' he\r\nsays, \'I\'ll take her a letter, and not only that, but I\'ll bring you an\r\nanswer.\' Then all of a sudden he taps his forehead, the Boche, and\r\ncomes close to me--\'Listen, my friend, to a lot better still. If you\r\nlike to do what I say, you shall see your wife, and your kids as well,\r\nand all the lot, sure as I see you.\' He tells me, to do it, I\'ve only\r\ngot to go with him at a certain time with a Boche greatcoat and a shako\r\nthat he\'ll have for me. He\'d mix me up in a coal-fatigue in Lens, and\r\nwe\'d go to our house. I could go and have a look on condition that I\r\nlaid low and didn\'t show myself, and he\'d be responsible for the chaps\r\nof the fatigue, but there were non-coms. in the house that he wouldn\'t\r\nanswer for--and, old chap, I agreed!"\r\n\r\n"That was serious."\r\n\r\n"Yes, for sure, it was serious. I decided all at once, without thinking\r\nand without wishing to think, seeing I was dazzled with the idea of\r\nseeing my people again; and if I got shot afterwards, well, so much the\r\nworse--but give and take. The supply of law and demand they call it,\r\ndon\'t they?\r\n\r\n"My boy, it all went swimmingly. The only hitch was they had such hard\r\nwork to find a shako big enough, for, as you know, I\'m well off for\r\nhead. But even that was fixed up. They raked me out in the end a\r\nlousebox big enough to hold my head. I\'ve already some Boche\r\nboots--those that were Caron\'s, you know. So, behold us setting off in\r\nthe Boche trenches--and they\'re most damnably like ours--with these\r\ngood sorts of Boche comrades, who told me in very good French--same as\r\nI\'m speaking--not to fret myself.\r\n\r\n"There was no alarm, nothing. Getting there came off all right.\r\nEverything went off so sweet and simple that I fancied I must be a\r\ndefaulting Boche. We got to Lens at nightfall. I remember we passed in\r\nfront of La Perche and went down the Rue du Quatorze-Juillet. I saw\r\nsome of the townsfolk walking about in the streets like they do in our\r\nquarters. I didn\'t recognize them because of the evening, nor them me,\r\nbecause of the evening too, and because of the seriousness of things.\r\nIt was so dark you couldn\'t put your finger into your eye when I\r\nreached my folk\'s garden.\r\n\r\n"My heart was going top speed. I was all trembling from head to foot as\r\nif I were only a sort of heart myself. And I had to hold myself back\r\nfrom carrying on aloud, and in French too, I was so happy and upset.\r\nThe Kamarad says to me, \'You go, pass once, then another time, and look\r\nin at the door and the window. Don\'t look as if you were looking. Be\r\ncareful.\' So I get hold of myself again, and swallow my feelings all at\r\na gulp. Not a bad sort, that devil, seeing he\'d have had a hell of a\r\ntime if I\'d got nailed.\r\n\r\n"At our place, you know, same as everywhere in the Pas de Calais, the\r\noutside doors of the houses are cut in two. At the bottom, it\'s a sort\r\nof barrier, half-way up your body; and above, you might call it a\r\nshutter. So you can shut the bottom half and be one-half private.\r\n\r\n"The top half was open, and the room, that\'s the dining-room, and the\r\nkitchen as well, of course, was lighted up and I heard voices.\r\n\r\n"I went by with my neck twisted sideways. There were heads of men and\r\nwomen with a rosy light on them, round the round table and the lamp. My\r\neyes fell on her, on Clotilde. I saw her plainly. She was sitting\r\nbetween two chaps, non-coms., I believe, and they were talking to her.\r\nAnd what was she doing? Nothing; she was smiling, and her face was\r\nprettily bent forward and surrounded with a light little framework of\r\nfair hair, and the lamp gave it a bit of a golden look.\r\n\r\n"She was smiling. She was contented. She had a look of being well off,\r\nby the side of the Boche officer, and the lamp, and the fire that\r\npuffed an unfamiliar warmth out on me. I passed, and then I turned\r\nround, and passed again. I saw her again, and she was always smiling.\r\nNot a forced smile, not a debtor\'s smile, non, a real smile that came\r\nfrom her, that she gave. And during that time of illumination that I\r\npassed in two senses, I could see my baby as well, stretching her hands\r\nout to a great striped simpleton and trying to climb on his knee; and\r\nthen, just by, who do you think I recognized? Madeleine Vandaert,\r\nVandaert\'s wife, my pal of the 19th, that was killed at the Maine, at\r\nMontyon.\r\n\r\n"She knew he\'d been killed because she was in mourning. And she, she\r\nwas having good fun, and laughing outright, I tell you--and she looked\r\nat one and the other as much as to say, \'I\'m all right here!\'\r\n\r\n"Ah, my boy, I cleared out of that, and butted into the Kamarads that\r\nwere waiting to take me back. How I got back I couldn\'t tell you. I was\r\nknocked out. I went stumbling like a man under a curse, and if any-body\r\nhad said a wrong word to me just then--! I should have shouted out\r\nloud; I should have made a row, so as to get killed and be done with\r\nthis filthy life!\r\n\r\n"Do you catch on? She was smiling, my wife, my Clotilde, at this time\r\nin the war! And why? Have we only got to be away for a time for us not\r\nto count any more? You take your damned hook from home to go to the\r\nwar, and everything seems finished with; and they worry for a while\r\nthat you\'re gone, but bit by bit you become as if you didn\'t exist,\r\nthey can do without you to be as happy as they were before, and to\r\nsmile. Ah, Christ! I\'m not talking of the other woman that was\r\nlaughing, but my Clotilde, mine, who at that chance moment when I saw\r\nher, whatever you may say, was getting on damned well without me!\r\n\r\n"And then, if she\'d been with friends or relations; but no, actually\r\nwith Boche officers! Tell me, shouldn\'t I have had good reason to jump\r\ninto the room, fetch her a couple of swipes, and wring the neck of the\r\nother old hen in mourning?\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I thought of doing it. I know all right I was getting\r\nviolent, I was getting out of control.\r\n\r\n"Mark me. I don\'t want to say more about it than I have said. She\'s a\r\ngood lass, Clotilde. I know her, and I\'ve confidence in her. I\'m not\r\nfar wrong, you know. If I were done in, she\'d cry all the tears in her\r\nbody to begin with. She thinks I\'m alive, I admit, but that isn\'t the\r\npoint. She can\'t prevent herself from being; well off, and contented,\r\nand letting herself go, when she\'s a good fire, a good lamp, and\r\ncompany, whether I\'m there or not--"\r\n\r\nI led Poterloo away: "You exaggerate, old chap; you\'re getting absurd\r\nnotions, come." We had walked very slowly and were still at the foot of\r\nthe hill. The fog was becoming like silver as it prepared for\r\ndeparture. Sunshine was very near.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nPoterloo looked up and said, "We\'ll go round by the Carency road and go\r\nin at the back." We struck off at an angle into the fields. At the end\r\nof a few minutes he said to me, "I exaggerate, you think? You say that\r\nI exaggerate?" He reflected. "Ah!" Then he added, with the shaking of\r\nthe head that had hardly left him all the morning, "What about it? All\r\nthe same, it\'s a fact--"\r\n\r\nWe climbed the slope. The cold had become tepidity. Arrived on a little\r\nplateau--"Let\'s sit here again before going in," he proposed. He sat\r\ndown, heavy with the world of thought that entangled him. His forehead\r\nwas wrinkled. Then he turned towards me with an awkward air, as if he\r\nwere going to beg some favor: "Tell me, mate, I\'m wondering if I\'m\r\nright."\r\n\r\nBut after looking at me, he looked at everything else, as though he\r\nwould rather consult them than me.\r\n\r\nA transformation was taking place in the sky and on the earth. The fog\r\nwas hardly more than a fancy. Distances revealed themselves. The narrow\r\nplain, gloomy and gray, was getting bigger, chasing its shadows away,\r\nand assuming color. The light was passing over it from east to west\r\nlike sails.\r\n\r\nAnd down there at our very feet, by the grace of distance and of light,\r\nwe saw Souchez among the trees--the little place arose again before our\r\neyes, new-born in the sunshine!\r\n\r\n"Am I right?" repeated Poterloo, more faltering, more dubious.\r\n\r\nBefore I could speak he replied to himself, at first almost in a\r\nwhisper, as the light fell on him--"She\'s quite young, you know; she\'s\r\ntwenty-six. She can\'t hold her youth in, it\'s coming out of her all\r\nover, and when she\'s resting in the lamp-light and the warmth, she\'s\r\ngot to smile; and even if she burst out laughing, it would just simply\r\nbe her youth, singing in her throat. It isn\'t on account of others, if\r\ntruth were told; it\'s on account of herself. It\'s life. She lives. Ah,\r\nyes, she lives, and that\'s all. It isn\'t her fault if she lives. You\r\nwouldn\'t have her die? Very well, what do you want her to do? Cry all\r\nday on account of me and the Boches? Grouse? One can\'t cry all the\r\ntime, nor grouse for eighteen months. Can\'t be done. It\'s too long, I\r\ntell you. That\'s all there is to it."\r\n\r\nHe stops speaking to look at the view of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, now\r\nwholly illuminated.\r\n\r\n"Same with the kid; when she found herself alongside a simpleton that\r\ndoesn\'t tell her to go and play with herself, she ends by wanting to\r\nget on his knee. Perhaps she\'d prefer that it was her uncle or a friend\r\nor her father--perhaps--but she tries it on all the same with the only\r\nman that\'s always there, even if it\'s a great hog in spectacles.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he cries, as he gets up and comes gesticulating before me.\r\n"There\'s a good answer one could give me. If I didn\'t come back from\r\nthe war, I should say, \'My lad, you\'ve gone to smash, no more Clotilde,\r\nno more love! You\'ll be replaced in her heart sooner or later; no\r\ngetting round it; your memory, the portrait of you that she carries in\r\nher, that\'ll fade bit by bit and another\'ll come on top of it, and\r\nshe\'ll begin another life again.\' Ah, if I didn\'t come back!"\r\n\r\nHe laughs heartily. "But I mean to come back. Ah, yes! One must be\r\nthere. Otherwise--I must be there, look you," he says again more\r\nseriously; "otherwise, if you\'re not there, even if you\'re dealing with\r\nsaints and angels, you\'ll be at fault in the end. That\'s life. But I am\r\nthere." He laughs. "Well, I\'m a little there, as one might say!"\r\n\r\nI get up too, and tap him on the shoulder. "You\'re right, old pal,\r\nit\'ll all come to an end."\r\n\r\nHe rubs his hands and goes on talking. "Yes, by God! it\'ll all finish,\r\ndon\'t worry. Oh, I know well there\'ll be hard graft before it\'s\r\nfinished, and still more after. We\'ve got to work, and I don\'t only\r\nmean work with the arms.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be necessary to make everything over again. Very well, we\'ll do\r\nit. The house? Gone. The garden? Nowhere. All right, we\'ll rebuild the\r\nhouse, we\'ll remake the garden. The less there is the more we\'ll make\r\nover again. After all, it\'s life, and we\'re made to remake, eh? And\r\nwe\'ll remake our life together, and happiness. We\'ll make the days\r\nagain; we\'ll remake the nights.\r\n\r\n"And the other side, too. They\'ll make their world again. Do you know\r\nwhat I say?--perhaps it won\'t be as long as one thinks--"\r\n\r\n"Tiens! I can see Madeleine Vandaert marrying another chap. She\'s a\r\nwidow; but, old man, she\'s been a widow eighteen months. Do you think\r\nit\'s not a big slice, that, eighteen months? They even leave off\r\nwearing mourning, I believe, about that time! People don\'t remember\r\nthat when they say \'What a strumpet she is,\' and when, in effect, they\r\nask her to commit suicide. But mon vieux, one forgets. One is forced to\r\nforget. It isn\'t the people that make you forget; you do it yourself;\r\nit\'s just forgetfulness, mind you. I find Madeleine again all of a\r\nsudden, and to see her frivvling there it broke me up as much as if her\r\nhusband had been killed yesterday--it\'s natural. But it\'s a devil of a\r\nlong time since he got spiked, poor lad. It\'s a long time since, it\'s\r\ntoo long since. People are no longer the same. But, mark you, one must\r\ncome back, one must be there! We shall be there, and we shall be busy\r\nwith beginning again!"\r\n\r\nOn the way, he looks and winks, cheered up by finding a peg on which to\r\nhang his ideas. He says--"I can see it from here, after the war, all\r\nthe Souchez people setting themselves again to work and to life--what a\r\nbusiness! Tiens, Papa Ponce, for example, the back-number! He was so\r\npernickety that you could see him sweeping the grass in his garden with\r\na horsehair brush, or kneeling on his lawn and trimming the turf with a\r\npair of scissors. Very well, he\'ll treat himself to that again! And\r\nMadame Imaginaire, that lived in one of the last houses towards the\r\nChateau de Carleul, a large woman who seemed to roll along the ground\r\nas if she\'d got casters under her big circular petticoats. She had a\r\nchild every year, regular, punctual--a proper machine-gun of kids. Very\r\nwell, she\'ll take that occupation up again with all her might."\r\n\r\nHe stops and ponders, and smiles a very little--almost within himself:\r\n"Tiens, I\'ll tell you; I noticed--it isn\'t very important, this," he\r\ninsists, as though suddenly embarrassed by the triviality of this\r\nparenthesis--"but I noticed (you notice it in a glance when you\'re\r\nnoticing something else) that it was cleaner in our house than in my\r\ntime--"\r\n\r\nWe come on some little rails in the ground, climbing almost hidden in\r\nthe withered grass underfoot. Poterloo points out with his foot this\r\nbit of abandoned track, and smiles; "That, that\'s our railway. It was a\r\ncripple, as you may say; that means something that doesn\'t move. It\r\ndidn\'t work very quickly. A snail could have kept pace with it. We\r\nshall remake it. But certainly it won\'t go any quicker. That can\'t be\r\nallowed!"\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the top of the hill, Poterloo turned round and threw a\r\nlast look over the slaughtered places that we had just visited. Even\r\nmore than a minute ago, distance recreated the village across the\r\nremains of trees shortened and sliced that now looked like young\r\nsaplings. Better even than just now, the sun shed on that white and red\r\naccumulation of mingled material an appearance of life and even an\r\nillusion of meditation. Its very stones seemed to feel the vernal\r\nrevival. The beauty of sunshine heralded what would be, and revealed\r\nthe future. The face of the watching soldier, too, shone with a glamour\r\nof reincarnation, and the smile on it was born of the springtime and of\r\nhope. His rosy cheeks and blue eyes seemed brighter than ever.\r\n\r\nWe go down into the communication trench and there is sunshine there.\r\nThe trench is yellow, dry, and resounding. I admire its finely\r\ngeometrical depth, its shovel-smoothed and shining flanks; and I find\r\nit enjoyable to hear the clean sharp sound of our feet on the hard\r\nground or on the caillebotis--little gratings of wood, placed end to\r\nend and forming a plankway.\r\n\r\nI look at my watch. It tells me that it is nine o\'clock, and it shows\r\nme, too, a dial of delicate color where the sky is reflected in\r\nrose-pink and blue, and the fine fret-work of bushes that are planted\r\nthere above the marges of the trench.\r\n\r\nAnd Poterloo and I look at each other with a kind of confused delight.\r\nWe are glad to see each other, as though we were meeting after absence!\r\nHe speaks to me, and though I am quite familiar with the singsong\r\naccent of the North, I discover that he is singing.\r\n\r\nWe have had bad days and tragic nights in the cold and the rain and the\r\nmud. Now, although it is still winter, the first fine morning shows and\r\nconvinces us that it will soon be spring once more. Already the top of\r\nthe trench is graced by green young grass, and amid its new-born\r\nquivering some flowers are awakening. It means the end of contracted\r\nand constricted days. Spring is coming from above and from below. We\r\ninhale with joyful hearts; we are uplifted.\r\n\r\nYes, the bad days are ending. The war will end, too, que diable! And no\r\ndoubt it will end in the beautiful season that is coming, that already\r\nillumines us, whose zephyrs already caress us.\r\n\r\nA whistling sound--tiens, a spent bullet! A bullet? Nonsense--it\'s a\r\nblackbird! Curious how similar the sound was! The blackbirds and the\r\nbirds of softer song, the countryside and the pageant of the seasons,\r\nthe intimacy of dwelling-rooms, arrayed in light--Oh! the war will end\r\nsoon; we shall go back for good to our own; wife, children, or to her\r\nwho is at once wife and child, and we smile towards them in this young\r\nglory that already unites us again.\r\n\r\nAt the forking of the two trenches, in the open and on the edge, here\r\nis something like a doorway. Two posts lean one upon the other, with a\r\nconfusion of electric wires between them, hanging down like tropical\r\ncreepers. It looks well. You would say it was a theatrical contrivance\r\nor scene. A slender climbing plant twines round one of the posts, and\r\nas you follow it with your glance, you see that it already dares to\r\npass from one to the other.\r\n\r\nSoon, passing along this trench whose grassy slopes quiver like the\r\nflanks of a fine horse, we come out into our own trench on the Bethune\r\nroad, and here is our place. Our comrades are there, in clusters. They\r\nare eating, and enjoying the goodly temperature.\r\n\r\nThe meal finished, we clean our aluminium mess-tins or plates with a\r\nmorsel of bread. "Tiens, the sun\'s going!" It is true; a cloud has\r\npassed over and hidden it. "It\'s going to splash, my little lads," says\r\nLamuse "that\'s our luck all over! Just as we are going off!"\r\n\r\n"A damned country!" says Fouillade. In truth this Northern climate is\r\nnot worth much. It drizzles and mizzles, reeks and rains. And when\r\nthere is any sun it soon disappears in the middle of this great damp\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nOur four days in the trenches are finished, and the relief will\r\ncommence at nightfall. Leisurely we get ready for leaving. We fill and\r\nput aside the knapsacks and bags. We give a rub to the rifles and wrap\r\nthem up.\r\n\r\nIt is already four o\'clock. Darkness is falling quickly, and we grow\r\nindistinct to each other. "Damnation. Here\'s the rain!" A few drops and\r\nthen the downpour. Oh, la, la, la! We don our capes and tent-cloths. We\r\ngo back unto the dug-out, dabbling, and gathering mud on our knees,\r\nhands, and elbows, for the bottom of the trench is getting sticky. Once\r\ninside, we have hardly time to light a candle, stuck on a bit of stone,\r\nand to shiver all round--"Come on, en route!"\r\n\r\nWe hoist ourselves into the wet and windy darkness outside. I can dimly\r\nsee Poterloo\'s powerful shoulders; in the ranks we are always side by\r\nside. When we get going I call to him, "Are you there, old\r\nchap?"--"Yes, in front of you," he cries to me, turning round. As he\r\nturns he gets a buffet in the face from wind and rain, but he laughs.\r\nHis happy face of the morning abides with him. No downpour shall rob\r\nhim of the content that he carries in his strong and steadfast heart;\r\nno evil night put out the sunshine that I saw possess his thoughts some\r\nhours ago.\r\n\r\nWe march, and jostle each other, and stumble. The rain is continuous,\r\nand water runs in the bottom of the trench. The floor-gratings yield as\r\nthe soil becomes soaked; some of them slope to right or left and we\r\nskid on them. In the dark, too, one cannot see them, so we miss them at\r\nthe turnings and put our feet into holes full of water.\r\n\r\nEven in the grayness of the night I will not lose sight of the slaty\r\nshine of Poterloo\'s helmet, which streams like a roof under the\r\ntorrent, nor of the broad back that is adorned with a square of\r\nglistening oilskin. I lock my step in his, and from time to time I\r\nquestion him and he answers me--always in good humor, always serene and\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nWhen there are no more of the wooden floor-gratings, we tramp in the\r\nthick mud. It is dark now. There is a sudden halt and I am thrown on\r\nPoterloo. Up higher we hear half-angry reproaches--"What the devil,\r\nwill you get on? We shall get broken up!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get my trotters unstuck!" replies a pitiful voice.\r\n\r\nThe engulfed one gets clear at last, and we have to run to overtake the\r\nrest of the company. We begin to pant and complain, and bluster against\r\nthose who are leading. Our feet go down haphazard; we stumble and hold\r\nourselves up by the walls, so that our hands are plastered with mud.\r\nThe march becomes a stampede, full of the noise of metal things and of\r\noaths.\r\n\r\nIn redoubled rain there is a second halt; some one has fallen, and the\r\nhubbub is general. He picks himself up and we are off again. I exert\r\nmyself to follow Poterloo\'s helmet closely that gleams feebly in the\r\nnight before my eyes, and I shout from time to time, "All\r\nright?"--"Yes, yes, all right," he replies, puffing and blowing, and\r\nhis voice always singsong and resonant.\r\n\r\nOur knapsacks, tossed in this rolling race under the assault of the\r\nelements, drag and hurt our shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe trench is blocked by a recent landslide, and we plunge unto it. We\r\nhave to tear our feet out of the soft and clinging earth, lifting them\r\nhigh at each step. Then, when this crossing is laboriously\r\naccomplished, we topple down again into the slippery stream, in the\r\nbottom of which are two narrow ruts, boot-worn, which hold one\'s foot\r\nlike a vice, and there are pools into which it goes with a great\r\nsplash. In one place we must stoop very low to pass under a heavy and\r\nglutinous bridge that crosses the trench, and we only get through with\r\ndifficulty. It obliges us to kneel in the mud, to flatten ourselves on\r\nthe ground, and to crawl on all fours for a few paces. A little farther\r\nthere are evolutions to perform as we grasp a post that the sinking of\r\nthe ground has set aslope across the middle of the fairway.\r\n\r\nWe come to a trench-crossing. "Allons, forward! Look out for\r\nyourselves, boys!" says the adjutant, who has flattened himself in a\r\ncorner to let us pass and to speak to us. "This is a bad spot."\r\n\r\n"We\'re done up," shouts a voice so hoarse that I cannot identify the\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\n"Damn! I\'ve enough of it, I\'m stopping here," groans another, at the\r\nend of his wind and his muscle.\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to do?" replies the adjutant, "No fault of mine,\r\neh? Allons, get a move on, it\'s a bad spot--it was shelled at the last\r\nrelief!"\r\n\r\nWe go on through the tempest of wind and water. We seem to be going\r\never down and down, as in a pit. We slip and tumble, butt into the wall\r\nof the trench, into which we drive our elbows hard, so as to throw\r\nourselves upright again. Our going is a sort of long slide, on which we\r\nkeep up just how and where we can. What matters is to stumble only\r\nforward, and as straight as possible.\r\n\r\nWhere are we? I lift my head, in spite of the billows of rain, out of\r\nthis gulf where we are struggling. Against the hardly discernible\r\nbackground of the buried sky, I can make out the rim of the trench; and\r\nthere, rising before my eyes all at once and towering over that rim, is\r\nsomething like a sinister doorway, made of two black posts that lean\r\none upon the other, with something hanging from the middle like a\r\ntorn-off scalp. It is the doorway.\r\n\r\n"Forward! Forward!"\r\n\r\nI lower my head and see no more; but again I hear the feet that sink in\r\nthe mud and come out again, the rattle of the bayonets, the heavy\r\nexclamations, and the rapid breathing.\r\n\r\nOnce more there is a violent back-eddy. We pull up sharply, and again I\r\nam thrown upon Poterloo and lean on his back, his strong back and\r\nsolid, like the trunk of a tree, like healthfulness and like hope. He\r\ncries to me, "Cheer up, old man, we\'re there!"\r\n\r\nWe are standing still. It is necessary to go back a little--<i>Nom de\r\nDieu!</i>--no, we are moving on again!\r\n\r\nSuddenly a fearful explosion falls on us. I tremble to my skull; a\r\nmetallic reverberation fills my head; a scorching and suffocating smell\r\nof sulphur pierces my nostrils. The earth has opened in front of me. I\r\nfeel myself lifted and hurled aside--doubled up, choked, and half\r\nblinded by this lightning and thunder. But still my recollection is\r\nclear; and in that moment when I looked wildly and desperately for my\r\ncomrade-in-arms, I saw his body go up, erect and black, both his arms\r\noutstretched to their limit, and a flame in the place of his head!\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1:] All these high roads are stone-paved, and traffic is\r\nnoisy.--Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nThe Big Words\r\n\r\n\r\nBARQUE notices that I am writing. He comes towards me on all fours\r\nthrough the straw and lifts his intelligent face to me, with its\r\nreddish forelock and the little quick eyes over which circumflex\r\naccents fold and unfold them-selves. His mouth is twisting in all\r\ndirections, by reason of a tablet of chocolate that he crunches and\r\nchews, while he holds the moist stump of it in his fist.\r\n\r\nWith his mouth full, and wafting me the odor of a sweetshop, he\r\nstammers--"Tell me, you writing chap, you\'ll be writing later about\r\nsoldiers, you\'ll be speaking of us, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Why yes, sonny, I shall talk about you, and about the boys, and about\r\nour life."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, then"--he indicates with a nod the papers on which I have\r\nbeen making notes. With hovering pencil I watch and listen to him. He\r\nhas a question to put to me--"Tell me, then, though you needn\'t if you\r\ndon\'t want--there\'s something I want to ask you. This is it; if you\r\nmake the common soldiers talk in your book, are you going to make them\r\ntalk like they do talk, or shall you put it all straight--into pretty\r\ntalk? It\'s about the big words that we use. For after all, now, besides\r\nfalling out sometimes and blackguarding each other, you\'ll never hear\r\ntwo poilus open their heads for a minute without saying and repeating\r\nthings that the printers wouldn\'t much like to print. Then what? If you\r\ndon\'t say \'em, your portrait won\'t be a lifelike one it\'s as if you\r\nwere going to paint them and then left out one of the gaudiest colors\r\nwherever you found it. All the same, it isn\'t usually done."\r\n\r\n"I shall put the big words in their place, dadda, for they\'re the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"But tell me, if you put \'em in, won\'t the people of your sort say\r\nyou\'re swine, without worrying about the truth?"\r\n\r\n"Very likely, but I shall do it all the same, without worrying about\r\nthose people."\r\n\r\n"Do you want my opinion? Although I know nothing about books, it\'s\r\nbrave to do that, because it isn\'t usually done, and it\'ll be spicy if\r\nyou dare do it--but you\'ll find it hard when it comes to it, you\'re too\r\npolite. That\'s just one of the faults I\'ve found in you since we\'ve\r\nknown each other; that, and also that dirty habit you\'ve got, when\r\nthey\'re serving brandy out to us, you pretend it\'ll do you harm, and\r\ninstead of giving your share to a pal, you go and pour it on your head\r\nto wash your scalp."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nOf Burdens\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the end of the yard of the Muets farm, among the outbuildings, the\r\nbarn gapes like a cavern. It is always caverns for us, even in houses!\r\nWhen you have crossed the yard, where the manure yields underfoot with\r\na spongy sound or have gone round it instead on the narrow paved path\r\nof difficult equilibrium, and when you have arrived at the entrance to\r\nthe barn, you can see nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThen, if you persist, you make out a misty hollow where equally misty\r\nand dark lumps are asquat or prone or wandering from one corner to\r\nanother. At the back, on the right and on the left, the pale gleams of\r\ntwo candles, each with the round halo of a distant moon allow you at\r\nlast to make out the human shape of these masses, whose mouths emit\r\neither steam or thick smoke.\r\n\r\nOur hazy retreat, which I allow carefully to swallow me whole, is a\r\nscene of excitement this evening. We leave for the trenches to-morrow\r\nmorning, and the nebulous tenants of the barn are beginning to pack up.\r\n\r\nAlthough darkness falls on my eyes and chokes them as I come in from\r\nthe pallid evening, I still dodge the snares spread over the ground by\r\nwater-bottles, mess-tins and weapons, but I butt full into the loaves\r\nthat are packed together exactly in the middle, like the paving of a\r\nyard. I reach my corner. Something alive is there with a huge back,\r\nfleecy and rounded, squatting and stooping over a collection of little\r\nthings that glitter on the ground, and I tap the shoulder upholstered\r\nin sheepskin. The being turns round, and by the dull and fitful gleam\r\nof a candle which a bayonet stuck in the ground upholds, I see one half\r\nof a face, an eye, the end of a mustache, and the corner of a half-open\r\nmouth. It growls in a friendly way, and resumes the inspection of its\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m fixing things, and clearing up."\r\n\r\nThe quasi-brigand who appears to be checking his booty, is my comrade\r\nVolpatte. He has folded his tent-cloth in four and placed it on his\r\nbed--that is, on the truss of straw assigned to him--and on this carpet\r\nhe has emptied and displayed the contents of his pockets.\r\n\r\nAnd it is quite a shop that he broods over with a housewife\'s\r\nsolicitous eyes, watchful and jealous, lest some one walks over him.\r\nWith my eye I tick off his copious exhibition.\r\n\r\nAlongside his handkerchief, pipe, tobacco-pouch (which also contains a\r\nnote-book), knife, purse, and pocket pipe-lighter, which comprise the\r\nnecessary and indispensable groundwork, here are two leather laces\r\ntwisted like earthworms round a watch enclosed in a case of transparent\r\ncelluloid, which has curiously dulled and blanched with age. Then a\r\nlittle round mirror, and another square one; this last, though broken,\r\nis of better quality, and bevel-edged. A flask of essence of\r\nturpentine, a flask of mineral oil nearly empty, and a third flask,\r\nempty. A German belt-plate, bearing the device, "Gott mit uns"; a\r\ndragoon\'s tassel of similar origin; half wrapped in paper, an aviator\'s\r\narrow in the form of a steel pencil and pointed like a needle; folding\r\nscissors and a combined knife and fork of similar pliancy; a stump of\r\npencil and one of candle; a tube of aspirin, also containing opium\r\ntablets, and several tin boxes.\r\n\r\nObserving that my inspection of his personal possessions is detailed,\r\nVolpatte helps me to identify certain items--\r\n\r\n"That, that\'s a leather officer\'s glove. I cut the fingers off to stop\r\nup the mouth of my blunderbuss with; that, that\'s telephone wire, the\r\nonly thing to fasten buttons on your greatcoat with if you want \'em to\r\nstay there; and here, inside here, d\'you know what that is? White\r\nthread, good stuff, not what you\'re put off with when they give you new\r\nthings, a sort of macaroni au fromage that you pull out with a fork;\r\nand there\'s a set of needles on a post-card. The safety-pins, they\'re\r\nthere, separate."\r\n\r\n"And here, that\'s the paper department. Quite a library."\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a surprising collection of papers among the things\r\ndisgorged by Volpatte\'s pockets--the violet packet of writing-paper,\r\nwhose unworthy printed envelope is out at heels; an Army squad-book, of\r\nwhich the dirty and desiccated binding, like the skin of an old tramp,\r\nhas perished and shrunk all over: a note-book with a chafed moleskin\r\ncover, and packed with papers and photographs, those of his wife and\r\nchildren enthroned in the middle.\r\n\r\nOut of this bundle of yellowed and darkened papers Volpatte extracts\r\nthis photograph and shows it to me once more. I renew acquaintance with\r\nMadame Volpatte and her generous bosom, her mild and mellow features;\r\nand with the two little boys in white collars, the elder slender, the\r\nyounger round as a ball.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only got photos of old people," says Biquet, who is twenty years\r\nold. He shows us a portrait holding it close to the candle, of two aged\r\npeople who look at us with the same well-behaved air as Volpatte\'s\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got mine with me, too," says another; "I always stick to the\r\nphoto of the nestlings."\r\n\r\n"Course! Every man carries his crowd along," adds another.\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny," Barque declares, "a portrait wears itself out just with\r\nbeing looked at. You haven\'t got to gape at it too often, or be too\r\nlong about it; in the long run, I don\'t know what happens, but the\r\nlikeness mizzles."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right," says Blaire, "I\'ve found it like that too, exactly.\'\'\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a map of the district as well, among my papers," Volpatte\r\ncontinues. He unfolds it to the light. Illegible and transparent at the\r\ncreases, it looks like one of those window-blinds made of squares sewn\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve some newspaper too"--he unfolds a newspaper article upon\r\npoilus--"and a book"--a twopence-half-penny novel, called Twice a\r\nMaid--"Tiens, another newspaper cutting from the Etampes Bee. Don\'t\r\nknow why I\'ve kept that, but there must be a reason somewhere. I\'ll\r\nthink about it when I have time. And then, my pack of cards, and a set\r\nof draughts, with a paper board and the pieces made of sealing-wax."\r\n\r\nBarque comes up, regards the scene, and says, "I\'ve a lot more things\r\nthan that in my pockets." He addresses himself to Volpatte. "Have you\r\ngot a Boche pay-book, louse-head, some phials of iodine, and a\r\nBrowning? I\'ve all that, and two knives."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no revolver," says Volpatte, "nor a Boche pay-book, but I could\r\nhave had two knives or even ten knives; but I only need one."\r\n\r\n"That depends," says Barque. "And have you any mechanical buttons,\r\nfathead?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t any," cries Becuwe.\r\n\r\n"The private can\'t do without \'em," Lamuse asserts. "Without them, to\r\nmake your braces stick to your breeches, the game\'s up."\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve always got in my pocket," says Blaire, "so\'s they\'re within\r\nreach, my case of rings." He brings it cut, wrapped up in a gas-mask\r\nbag, and shakes it. The files ring inside, and we hear the jingle of\r\naluminium rings in the rough.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always got string," says Biquet, "that\'s the useful stuff!"\r\n\r\n"Not so useful as nails," says Pepin, and he shows three in his hand,\r\nbig, little, and average.\r\n\r\nOne by one the others come to join in the conversation, to chaffer and\r\ncadge. We are getting used to the half-darkness. But Corporal Salavert,\r\nwho has a well-earned reputation for dexterity, makes a hanging lamp\r\nwith a candle and a tray, the latter contrived from a Camembert box and\r\nsome wire. We light up, and around its illumination each man tells what\r\nhe has in his pockets, with parental preferences and bias.\r\n\r\n"To begin with, how many have we?"\r\n\r\n"How many pockets? Eighteen," says some one--Cocon, of course, the man\r\nof figures.\r\n\r\n"Eighteen pockets! You\'re codding, rat-nose," says big Lamuse.\r\n\r\n"Exactly eighteen," replies Cocon. "Count them, if you\'re as clever as\r\nall that."\r\n\r\nLamuse is willing to be guided by reason in the matter, and putting his\r\ntwo hands near the light so as to count accurately, he tells off his\r\ngreat brick-red fingers: Two pockets in the back of the greatcoat; one\r\nfor the first-aid packet, which is used for tobacco; two inside the\r\ngreatcoat in front; two outside it on each side, with flaps; three in\r\nthe trousers, and even three and a half, counting the little one in\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet a compass on it," says Farfadet.\r\n\r\n"And I, my bits of tinder."\r\n\r\n"I," says Tirloir, "I\'ll bet a teeny whistle that my wife sent me when\r\nshe said, \'If you\'re wounded in the battle you must whistle, so that\r\nyour comrades will come and save your life.\'"\r\n\r\nWe laugh at the artless words. Tulacque intervenes, and says\r\nindulgently to Tiloir, "They don\'t know what war is back there; and if\r\nyou started talking about the rear, it\'d be you that\'d talk rot."\r\n\r\n"We won\'t count that pocket," says Salavert, "it\'s too small. That\r\nmakes ten."\r\n\r\n"In the jacket, four. That only makes fourteen after all."\r\n\r\n"There are the two cartridge pockets, the two new ones that fasten with\r\nstraps."\r\n\r\n"Sixteen," says Salavert.\r\n\r\n"Now, blockhead and son of misery, turn my jacket back. You haven\'t\r\ncounted those two pockets. Now then, what more do you want? And yet\r\nthey\'re just in the usual place. They\'re your civilian pockets, where\r\nyou shoved your nose-rag, your tobacco, and the address where you\'d got\r\nto deliver your parcel when you were a messenger."\r\n\r\n"Eighteen!" says Salavert, as grave as a judge. "There are eighteen,\r\nand no mistake; that\'s done it."\r\n\r\nAt this point in the conversation, some one makes a series of noisy\r\nstumbles on the stones of the threshold with the sound of a horse\r\npawing the ground--and blaspheming. Then, after a silence, the barking\r\nof a sonorous and authoritative voice--"Hey, inside there! Getting\r\nready? Everything must be fixed up this evening and packed tight and\r\nsolid, you know. Going into the first line this time, and we may have a\r\nhot time of it."\r\n\r\n"Right you are, right you are, mon adjutant," heedless voices answer.\r\n\r\n"How do you write \'Arnesse\'?" asks Benech, who is on all fours, at work\r\nwith a pencil and an envelope. While Cocon spells "Ernest" for him and\r\nthe voice of the vanished adjutant is heard afar repeating his\r\nharangue, Blaire picks up the thread, and says--\r\n\r\n"You should always, my children--listen to what I\'m telling you--put\r\nyour drinking-cup in your pocket. I\'ve tried to stick it everywhere\r\nelse, but only the pocket\'s really practical, you take my word. If\r\nyou\'re in marching order, or if you\'ve doffed your kit to navigate the\r\ntrenches either, you\'ve always got it under your fist when chances\r\ncome, like when a pal who\'s got some gargle, and feels good towards you\r\nsays, \'Lend us your cup,\' or a peddling wine-seller, either. My young\r\nbucks, listen to what I tell you; you\'ll always find it good--put your\r\ncup in your pocket."\r\n\r\n"No fear," says Lamuse, "you won\'t see me put my cup in my pocket;\r\ndamned silly idea, no more or less. I\'d a sight sooner sling it on a\r\nstrap with a hook."\r\n\r\n"Fasten it on a greatcoat button, like the gas-helmet bag, that\'s a lot\r\nbetter; for suppose you take off your accouterments and there\'s any\r\nwine passing, you look soft."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a Boche drinking-cup," says Barque; "it\'s flat, so it goes\r\ninto a side pocket if you like, or it goes very well into a\r\ncartridge-pouch, once you\'ve fired the damn things off or pitched them\r\ninto a bag."\r\n\r\n"A Boche cup\'s nothing special," says Pepin; "it won\'t stand up, it\'s\r\njust lumber."\r\n\r\n"You wait and see, maggot-snout," says Tirette, who is something of a\r\npsychologist. "If we attack this time, same as the adjutant seemed to\r\nhint, perhaps you\'ll find a Boche cup, and then it\'ll be something\r\nspecial!"\r\n\r\n"The adjutant may have said that," Eudore observes, "but he doesn\'t\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"It holds more than a half-pint, the Boche cup," remarks Cocon, "seeing\r\nthat the exact capacity of the half-pint is marked in the cup\r\nthree-quarters way up; and it\'s always good for you to have a big one,\r\nfor if you\'ve got a cup that only just holds a half-pint, then so that\r\nyou can get your half-pint of coffee or wine or holy water or what not,\r\nit\'s get to be filled right up, and they don\'t ever do it at\r\nserving-out, and if they do, you spill it."\r\n\r\n"I believe you that they don\'t fill it," says Paradis, exasperated by\r\nthe recollection of that ceremony. "The quartermaster-sergeant, he\r\npours it with his blasted finger in your cup and gives it two raps on\r\nits bottom. Result, you get a third, and your cup\'s in mourning with\r\nthree black bands on top of each other."\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Barque, "that\'s true; but you shouldn\'t have a cup too big\r\neither, because the chap that\'s pouring it out for you, he suspects\r\nyou, and let\'s it go in damned drops, and so as not to give you more\r\nthan your measure he gives you less, and you can whistle for it, with\r\nyour tureen in your fists."\r\n\r\nVolpatte puts back in his pockets, one by one, the items of his\r\ndisplay. When he came to the purse, he looked at it with an air of deep\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\n"He\'s damnably flat, poor chap!" He counted the contents. "Three\r\nfrancs! My boy, I must set about feathering this nest again or I shall\r\nbe stony when we get back."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not the only one that\'s broken-backed in the treasury."\r\n\r\n"The soldier spends more than he earns, and don\'t you forget it. I\r\nwonder what\'d become of a man that only had his pay?"\r\n\r\nParadis replies with concise simplicity, "He\'d kick the bucket."\r\n\r\n"And see here, look what I\'ve got in my pocket and never let go\r\nof"--Pepin, with merry eyes, shows us some silver table-things. "They\r\nbelonged," he says, "to the ugly trollop where we were quartered at\r\nGrand-Rozoy."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they still belong to her?"\r\n\r\nPepin made an uncertain gesture, in which pride mingled with modesty;\r\nthen, growing bolder, he smiled and said, "I knew her, the old sneak.\r\nCertainly, she\'ll spend the rest of her life looking in every corner\r\nfor her silver things."\r\n\r\n"For my part," says Volpatte, "I\'ve never been able to rake in more\r\nthan a pair of scissors. Some people have the luck. I haven\'t. So\r\nnaturally I watch \'em close, though I admit I\'ve no use for \'em."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve pinched a few bits of things here and there, but what of it? The\r\nsappers have always left me behind in the matter of pinching; so what\r\nabout it?"\r\n\r\n"You can do what you like, you\'re always got at by some one in your\r\nturn, eh, my boy? Don\'t fret about it."\r\n\r\n"I keep my wife\'s letters," says Blaire.\r\n\r\n"And I send mine back to her."\r\n\r\n"And I keep them, too. Here they are." Eudore exposes a packet of worn\r\nand shiny paper, whose grimy condition the twilight modestly veils. "I\r\nkeep them. Sometimes I read them again. When I\'m cold and humpy, I read\r\n\'em again. It doesn\'t actually warm you up, but it seems to."\r\n\r\nThere must be a deep significance in the curious expression, for\r\nseveral men raise their heads and say, "Yes, that\'s so."\r\n\r\nBy fits and starts the conversation goes on in the bosom of this\r\nfantastic barn and the great moving shadows that cross it; night is\r\nheaped up in its corners, and pointed by a few scattered and sickly\r\ncandles.\r\n\r\nI watch these busy and burdened flitters come and go, outline\r\nthemselves strangely, then stoop and slide down to the ground; they\r\ntalk to themselves and to each other, their feet are encumbered by the\r\nlitter. They are showing their riches to each other. "Tiens,\r\nlook!"--"Great!" they reply enviously.\r\n\r\nWhat they have not got they want. There are treasures among the squad\r\nlong coveted by all; the two-liter water-bottle, for instance,\r\npreserved by Barque, that a skillful rifle-shot with a blank cartridge\r\nhas stretched to the capacity of two and a half liters; and Bertrand\'s\r\nfamous great knife with the horn handle.\r\n\r\nAmong the heaving swarm there are sidelong glances that skim these\r\ncuriosities, and then each man resumes "eyes right," devotes himself to\r\nhis belongings, and concentrates upon getting it in order.\r\n\r\nThey are mournful belongings, indeed. Everything made for the soldier\r\nis commonplace, ugly, and of bad quality; from his cardboard boots,\r\nattached to the uppers by a criss-cross of worthless thread, to his\r\nbadly cut, badly shaped, and badly sewn clothes, made of shoddy and\r\ntransparent cloth--blotting-paper--that one day of sunshine fades and\r\nan hour of rain wets through, to his emaciated leathers, brittle as\r\nshavings and torn by the buckle spikes, to his flannel underwear that\r\nis thinner than cotton, to his straw-like tobacco.\r\n\r\nMarthereau is beside me, and he points to our comrades: "Look at them,\r\nthese poor chaps gaping into their bags o\' tricks. You\'d say it was a\r\nmothers\' meeting, ogling their kids. Hark to \'em. They\'re calling for\r\ntheir knick-knacks. Tiens, that one, the times he says \'My knife!\' same\r\nas if he was calling \'Lon,\' or \'Charles,\' or \'Dolphus.\' And you know\r\nit\'s impossible for them to make their load any less. Can\'t be did. It\r\nisn\'t that they don\'t want--our job isn\'t one that makes us any\r\nstronger, eh? But they can\'t. Too proud of \'em."\r\n\r\nThe burdens to be borne are formidable, and one knows well enough,\r\nparbleu, that every item makes them more severe, each little addition\r\nis one bruise more.\r\n\r\nFor it is not merely a matter of what one buries in his pockets and\r\npouches. To complete the burden there is what one carries on his back.\r\nThe knapsack is the trunk and even the cupboard; and the old soldier is\r\nfamiliar with the art of enlarging it almost miraculously by the\r\njudicious disposal of his household goods and provisions. Besides the\r\nregulation and obligatory contents--two tins of pressed beef, a dozen\r\nbiscuits, two tablets of coffee and two packets of dried soup, the bag\r\nof sugar, fatigue smock, and spare boots--we find a way of getting in\r\nsome pots of jam, tobacco, chocolate, candles, soft-soled shoes; and\r\neven soap, a spirit lamp, some solidified spirit, and some woolen\r\nthings. With the blanket, sheet, tentcloth, trenching-tool,\r\nwater-bottle, and an item of the field-cooking kit, [note 1] the burden\r\ngets heavier and taller and wider, monumental and crushing. And my\r\nneighbor says truly that every time he reaches his goal after some\r\nmiles of highway and communication trenches, the poilu swears hard that\r\nthe next time he\'ll leave a heap of things behind and give his\r\nshoulders a little relief from the yoke of the knapsack. But every time\r\nhe is preparing for departure, he assumes again the same overbearing\r\nand almost superhuman load; he never lets it go, though he curses it\r\nalways.\r\n\r\n"There are some bad boys," says Lamuse, "among the shirkers, that find\r\na way of keeping something in the company wagon or the medical van. I\r\nknow one that\'s got two shirts and a pair of drawers in an adjutant\'s\r\ncanteen [note 2]--but, you see, there\'s two hundred and fifty chaps in\r\nthe company, and they\'re all up to the dodge and not many of \'em can\r\nprofit by it; it\'s chiefly the non-coms.; the more stripes they\'ve got,\r\nthe easier it is to plant their luggage, not forgetting that the\r\ncommandant visits the wagons sometimes without warning and fires your\r\nthings into the middle of the road if he finds \'em in a horse-box where\r\nthey\'ve no business--Be off with you!--not to mention the bully-ragging\r\nand the clink."\r\n\r\n"In the early days it was all right, my boy. There were some\r\nchaps--I\'ve seen \'em--who stuck their bags and even their knapsacks in\r\nbaby-carts and pushed \'em along the road."\r\n\r\n"Ah, not half! Those were the good times of the war. But all that\'s\r\nchanged."\r\n\r\nVolpatte, deaf to all the talk, muffled in his blanket as if in a shawl\r\nwhich makes him look like an old witch, revolves round an object that\r\nlies on the ground. "I\'m wondering," he says, addressing no one,\r\n"whether to take away this damned tin stove. It\'s the only one in the\r\nsquad and I\'ve always carried it. Oui, but it leaks like a cullender."\r\nHe cannot decide, and makes a really pathetic picture of separation.\r\n\r\nBarque watches him obliquely, and makes fun of him. We hear him say,\r\n"Senile dodderer!" But he pauses in his chaffing to say, "After all, if\r\nwe were in his shoes we should be equally fatheaded."\r\n\r\nVolpatte postpones his decision till later. "I\'ll see about it in the\r\nmorning, when I\'m loading the camel\'s back."\r\n\r\nAfter the inspection and recharging of pockets, it is the turn of the\r\nbags, and then of the cartridge-pouches, and Barque holds forth on the\r\nway to make the regulation two hundred cartridges go into the three\r\npouches. In the lump it is impossible. They must be unpacked and placed\r\nside by side upright, head against foot. Thus can one cram each pouch\r\nwithout leaving any space, and make himself a waistband that weighs\r\nover twelve pounds.\r\n\r\nRifles have been cleaned already. One looks to the swathing of the\r\nbreech and the plugging of the muzzle, precautions which trench-dirt\r\nrenders indispensable.\r\n\r\nHow every rifle can easily be recognized is discussed. "I\'ve made some\r\nnicks in the sling. See, I\'ve cut into the edge."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve twisted a bootlace round the top of the sling, and that way, I\r\ncan tell it by touch as well as seeing."\r\n\r\n"I use a mechanical button. No mistake about that. In the dark I can\r\nfind it at once and say, \'That\'s my pea-shooter. Because, you know,\r\nthere are some boys that don\'t bother themselves; they just roll around\r\nwhile the pals are cleaning theirs, and then they\'re devilish quick at\r\nputting a quiet fist on a popgun that\'s been cleaned; and then after\r\nthey\'ve even the cheek to go and say, \'Mon capitaine, I\'ve got a rifle\r\nthat\'s a bit of all right.\' I\'m not on in that act. It\'s the D system,\r\nmy old wonder--a damned dirty dodge, and there are times when I\'m fed\r\nup with it, and more."\r\n\r\nAnd thus, though their rifles are all alike, they are as different as\r\ntheir handwriting.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"It\'s curious and funny," says Marthereau to me "we\'re going up to the\r\ntrenches to-morrow, and there\'s nobody drunk yet, nor that way\r\ninclined. Ah, I don\'t say," he concedes at once, "but what those two\r\nthere aren\'t a bit fresh, nor a little elevated; without being\r\nabsolutely blind, they\'re somewhat boozed, pr\'aps--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Poitron and Poilpot, of Broyer\'s squad."\r\n\r\nThey are lying down and talking in a low voice. We can make out the\r\nround nose of one, which stands out equally with his mouth, close by a\r\ncandle, and with his hand, whose lifted finger makes little explanatory\r\nsigns, faithfully followed by the shadow it casts.\r\n\r\n"I know how to light a fire, but I don\'t know how to light it again\r\nwhen it\'s gone out," declares Poitron.\r\n\r\n"Ass!" says Poilpot, "if you know how to light it you know how to\r\nrelight it, seeing that if you light it, it\'s because it\'s gone out,\r\nand you might say that you\'re relighting it when you\'re lighting it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all rot. I\'m not mathematical, and to hell with the gibberish\r\nyou talk. I tell you and I tell you again that when it comes to\r\nlighting a fire, I\'m there, but to light it again when it\'s gone out,\r\nI\'m no good. I can\'t speak any straighter than that."\r\n\r\nI do not catch the insistent retort of Poilpot, but--"But, you damned\r\nnumskull," gurgles Poitron, "haven\'t I told you thirty times that I\r\ncan\'t? You must have a pig\'s head, anyway!"\r\n\r\nMarthereau confides to me, "I\'ve heard about enough of that." Obviously\r\nhe spoke too soon just now.\r\n\r\nA sort of fever, provoked by farewell libations, prevails in the\r\nwretched straw-spread hole where our tribe--some upright and hesitant,\r\nothers kneeling and hammering like colliers--is mending, stacking, and\r\nsubduing its provisions, clothes, and tools. There is a wordy growling,\r\na riot of gesture. From the smoky glimmers, rubicund faces start forth\r\nin relief, and dark hands move about in the shadows like marionettes.\r\nIn the barn next to ours, and separated from it only by a wall of a\r\nman\'s height, arise tipsy shouts. Two men in there have fallen upon\r\neach other with fierce violence and anger. The air is vibrant with the\r\ncoarsest expressions the human ear ever hears. But one of the\r\ndisputants, a stranger from another squad, is ejected by the tenants,\r\nand the flow of curses from the other grows feebler and expires.\r\n\r\n"Same as us," says Marthereau with a certain pride, "they hold\r\nthemselves in!"\r\n\r\nIt is true. Thanks to Bertrand, who is possessed by a hatred of\r\ndrunkenness, of the fatal poison that gambles with multitudes, our\r\nsquad is one of the least befouled by wine and brandy.\r\n\r\nThey are shouting and singing and talking all around. And they laugh\r\nendlessly, for in the human mechanism laughter is the sound of wheels\r\nthat work, of deeds that are done.\r\n\r\nOne tries to fathom certain faces that show up in provocative relief\r\namong this menagerie of shadows, this aviary of reflections. But one\r\ncannot. They are visible, but you can see nothing in the depth of them.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"Ten o\'clock already, friends," says Bertrand. "We\'ll finish the\r\ncamel\'s humps off to-morrow. Time for by-by." Each one then slowly\r\nretires to rest, but the jabbering hardly pauses. Man takes all things\r\neasily when he is under no obligation to hurry. The men go to and fro,\r\neach with some object in his hand, and along the wall I watch Eudore\'s\r\nhuge shadow gliding, as he passes in front of a candle with two little\r\nbags of camphor hanging from the end of his fingers.\r\n\r\nLamuse is throwing himself about in search of a good position; he seems\r\nill at ease. To-day, obviously, and whatever his capacity may be, he\r\nhas eaten too much.\r\n\r\n"Some of us want to sleep! Shut them up, you lot of louts!" cries\r\nMesnil Joseph from his litter.\r\n\r\nThis entreaty has a subduing effect for a moment, but does not stop the\r\nburble of voices nor the passing to and fro.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going up to-morrow, it\'s true," says Paradis, "and in the\r\nevening we shall go into the first line. But nobody\'s thinking about\r\nit. We know it, and that\'s all."\r\n\r\nGradually each has regained his place. I have stretched myself on the\r\nstraw, and Marthereau wraps himself up by my side.\r\n\r\nEnter an enormous bulk, taking great pains not to make a noise. It is\r\nthe field-hospital sergeant, a Marist Brother, a huge bearded simpleton\r\nin spectacles. When he has taken off his greatcoat and appears in his\r\njacket, you are conscious that he feels awkward about showing his legs.\r\nWe see that it hurries discreetly, this silhouette of a bearded\r\nhippopotamus. He blows, sighs, and mutters.\r\n\r\nMarthereau indicates him with a nod of his head, and says to me, "Look\r\nat him. Those chaps have always got to be talking fudge. When we ask\r\nhim what he does in civil life, he won\'t say \'I\'m a school teacher\' he\r\nsays, leering at you from under his specs with the half of his eyes,\r\n\'I\'m a professor.\' When he gets up very early to go to mass, he says,\r\n\'I\'ve got belly-ache, I must go and take a turn round the corner and no\r\nmistake.\'"\r\n\r\nA little farther off, Papa Ramure is talking of his homeland: "Where I\r\nlive, it\'s just a bit of a hamlet, no great shakes. There\'s my old man\r\nthere, seasoning pipes all day long; whether he\'s working or resting,\r\nhe blows his smoke up to the sky or into the smoke of the stove."\r\n\r\nI listen to this rural idyll, and it takes suddenly a specialized and\r\ntechnical character: "That\'s why he makes a paillon. D\'you know what a\r\npaillon is? You take a stalk of green corn and peel it. You split it in\r\ntwo and then in two again, and you have different sizes. Then with a\r\nthread and the four slips of straw, he goes round the stem of his\r\npipe--"\r\n\r\nThe lesson ceases abruptly, there being no apparent audience.\r\n\r\nThere are only two candles alight. A wide wing of darkness overspreads\r\nthe prostrate collection of men.\r\n\r\nPrivate conversation still flickers along the primitive dormitory, and\r\nsome fragments of it reach my ears. Just now, Papa Ramure is abusing\r\nthe commandant.\r\n\r\n"The commandant, old man, with his four bits of gold string, I\'ve\r\nnoticed he don\'t know how to smoke. He sucks all out at his pipes, and\r\nhe burns \'em. It isn\'t a mouth he\'s got in his head, it\'s a snout. The\r\nwood splits and scorches, and instead of being wood, it\'s coal. Clay\r\npipes, they\'ll stick it better, but he roasts \'em brown all the same.\r\nTalk about a snout! So, old man, mind what I\'m telling you, he\'ll come\r\nto what doesn\'t ever happen often; through being forced to get\r\nwhite-hot and baked to the marrow, his pipe\'ll explode in his nose\r\nbefore everybody. You\'ll see."\r\n\r\nLittle by little, peace, silence, and darkness take possession of the\r\nbarn and enshroud the hopes and the sighs of its occupants. The lines\r\nof identical bundles formed by these beings rolled up side by side in\r\ntheir blankets seem a sort of huge organ, which sends forth diversified\r\nsnoring.\r\n\r\nWith his nose already in his blanket, I hear Marthereau talking to me\r\nabout himself: "I\'m a buyer of rags, you know," he says, "or to put it\r\nbetter, a rag merchant. But me, I\'m wholesale; I buy from the little\r\nrag-and-bone men of the streets, and I have a shop--a warehouse mind\r\nyou!--which I use as a depot. I deal in all kinds of rags, from linen\r\nto jam-pots, but principally brush-handles, sacks, and old shoes; and\r\nnaturally, I make a specialty of rabbit-skins."\r\n\r\nAnd a little later I still hear him: "As for me, little and\r\nqueer-shaped as I am, all the same I can carry a bin of two hundred\r\npounds\' weight to the warehouse, up the steps, and my feet in sabots.\r\nOnce I had a to-do with a person--"\r\n\r\n"What I can\'t abide," cries Fouillade, all of a sudden, "is the\r\nexercises and marches they give us when we\'re resting. My back\'s\r\nmincemeat, and I can\'t get a snooze even, I\'m that cramped."\r\n\r\nThere is a metallic noise in Volpatte\'s direction. He has decided to\r\ntake the stove, though he chides it constantly for the fatal fault of\r\nits perforations.\r\n\r\nOne who is but half asleep groans, "Oh, la, la! When will this war\r\nfinish!"\r\n\r\nA cry of stubborn and mysterious rebellion bursts forth--"They\'d take\r\nthe very skin off us!"\r\n\r\nThere follows a single, "Don\'t fret yourself!" as darkly inconsequent\r\nas the cry of revolt.\r\n\r\nI wake up a long time afterwards, as two o\'clock is striking; and in a\r\npallor of light which doubtless comes from the moon, I see the agitated\r\nsilhouette of Pinegal. A cock has crowed afar. Pinegal raises himself\r\nhalfway to a sitting position, and I hear his husky voice: "Well now,\r\nit\'s the middle of the night, and there\'s a cock loosing his jaw. He\'s\r\nblind drunk, that cock." He laughs, and repeats, "He\'s blind, that\r\ncock," and he twists himself again into the woolens, and resumes his\r\nslumber with a gurgle in which snores are mingled with merriment.\r\n\r\nCocon has been wakened by Pinegal. The man of figures therefore thinks\r\naloud, and says: "The squad had seventeen men when it set off for the\r\nwar. It has seventeen also at present, with the stop-gaps. Each man has\r\nalready worn out four greatcoats, one of the original blue, and three\r\ncigar-smoke blue, two pairs of trousers and six pairs of boots. One\r\nmust count two rifles to each man, but one can\'t count the overalls.\r\nOur emergency rations have been renewed twenty-three times. Among us\r\nseventeen, we\'ve been mentioned fourteen times in Army Orders, of which\r\ntwo were to the Brigade, four to the Division, and one to the Army.\r\nOnce we stayed sixteen days in the trenches without relief. We\'ve been\r\nquartered and lodged in forty-seven different villages up to now. Since\r\nthe beginning of the campaign, twelve thousand men have passed through\r\nthe regiment, which consists of two thousand."\r\n\r\nA strange lisping noise interrupts him. It comes from Blaire, whose new\r\nivories prevent him from talking as they also prevent him from eating.\r\nBut he puts them in every evening, and retains them all night with\r\nfierce determination, for he was promised that in the end he would grow\r\naccustomed to the object they have put into his head.\r\n\r\nI raise myself on my elbow, as on a battlefield, and look once more on\r\nthe beings whom the scenes and happenings of the times have rolled up\r\nall together. I look at them all, plunged in the abyss of passive\r\noblivion, some of them seeming still to be absorbed in their pitiful\r\nanxieties, their childish instincts, and their slave-like ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe intoxication of sleep masters me. But I recall what they have done\r\nand what they will do; and with that consummate picture of a sorry\r\nhuman night before me, a shroud that fills our cavern with darkness, I\r\ndream of some great unknown light.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1] There is a complete set for each squad--stoves, canvas\r\nbuckets, coffee-mill, pan, etc--and each man carries some item on\r\nmarch.--Tr.\r\n\r\n[note 2] Cantine vivres, chest containing two days\' rations and cooking\r\nutensils for four or five officers.--Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nThe Egg\r\n\r\n\r\nWE were badly off, hungry and thirsty; and in these wretched quarters\r\nthere was nothing!\r\n\r\nSomething had gone wrong with the revictualing department and our wants\r\nwere becoming acute. Where the sorry place surrounded them, with its\r\nempty doors, its bones of houses, and its bald-headed telegraph posts,\r\na crowd of hungry men were grinding their teeth and confirming the\r\nabsence of everything:--"The juice has sloped and the wine\'s up the\r\nspout, and the bully\'s zero. Cheese? Nix. Napoo jam, napoo butter on\r\nskewers."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve nothing, and no error, nothing; and play hell as you like, it\r\ndoesn\'t help."\r\n\r\n"Talk about rotten quarters! Three houses with nothing inside but\r\ndraughts and damp."\r\n\r\n"No good having any of the filthy here, you might as well have only the\r\nskin of a bob in your purse, as long as there\'s nothing to buy."\r\n\r\n"You might be a Rothschild, or even a military tailor, but what use\'d\r\nyour brass be?"\r\n\r\n"Yesterday there was a bit of a cat mewing round where the 7th are. I\r\nfeel sure they\'ve eaten it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there was; you could see its ribs like rocks on the sea-shore."\r\n\r\n"There were some chaps," says Blaire, "who bustled about when they got\r\nhere and managed to find a few bottles of common wine at the bacca-shop\r\nat the corner of the street."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the swine! Lucky devils to be sliding that down their necks."\r\n\r\n"It was muck, all the same, it\'d make your cup as black as your\r\nbaccy-pipe."\r\n\r\n"There are some, they say, who\'ve swallowed a fowl."\r\n\r\n"Damn," says Fouillade.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve hardly had a bite. I had a sardine left, and a little tea in the\r\nbottom of a bag that I chewed up with some sugar."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t even have a bit of a drunk--it\'s off the map."\r\n\r\n"And that isn\'t enough either, even when you\'re not a big eater and\r\nyou\'re got a communication trench as flat as a pancake."\r\n\r\n"One meal in two days--a yellow mess, shining like gold, no broth and\r\nno meat--everything left behind."\r\n\r\n"And worst of all we\'ve nothing to light a pipe with."\r\n\r\n"True, and that\'s misery. I haven\'t a single match. I had several bits\r\nof ends, but they\'ve gone. I\'ve hunted in vain through all the pockets\r\nof my flea-case--nix. As for buying them it\'s hopeless, as you say."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got the head of a match that I\'m keeping." It is a real hardship\r\nindeed, and the sight is pitiful of the poilus who cannot light pipe or\r\ncigarette but put them away in their pockets and stroll in resignation.\r\nBy good fortune, Tirloir has his petrol pipe-lighter and it still\r\ncontains a little spirit. Those who are aware of it gather round him,\r\nbringing their pipes packed and cold. There is not even any paper to\r\nlight, and the flame itself must be used until the remaining spirit in\r\nits tiny insect\'s belly is burned.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I\'ve been lucky, and I see Paradis wandering about, his\r\nkindly face to the wind, grumbling and chewing a bit of wood. "Tiens,"\r\nI say to him, "take this."\r\n\r\n"A box of matches!" he exclaims amazed, looking at it as one looks at a\r\njewel. "Egad! That\'s capital! Matches!"\r\n\r\nA moment later we see him lighting his pipe, his face saucily sideways\r\nand splendidly crimsoned by the reflected flame, and everybody shouts,\r\n"Paradis\' got some matches!"\r\n\r\nTowards evening I meet Paradis near the ruined triangle of a\r\nhouse-front at the corner of the two streets of this most miserable\r\namong villages.\r\n\r\nHe beckons to me. "Hist!" He has a curious and rather awkward air.\r\n\r\n"I say," he says to me affectionately, but looking at his feet, "a bit\r\nsince, you chucked me a box of flamers. Well, you\'re going to get a bit\r\nof your own back for it. Here!"\r\n\r\nHe puts something in my hand. "Be careful!" he whispers, "it\'s fragile!"\r\n\r\nDazzled by the resplendent purity of his present, hardly even daring to\r\nbelieve my eyes, I see--an egg!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nAn Idyll\r\n\r\n\r\n"REALLY and truly," said Paradis, my neighbor in the ranks, "believe me\r\nor not, I\'m knocked out--I\'ve never before been so paid on a march as I\r\nhave been with this one, this evening."\r\n\r\nHis feet were dragging, and his square shoulders bowed under the burden\r\nof the knapsack, whose height and big irregular outline seemed almost\r\nfantastic. Twice he tripped and stumbled.\r\n\r\nParadis is tough. But he had been running up and down the trench all\r\nnight as liaison man while the others were sleeping, so he had good\r\nreason to be exhausted and to growl "Quoi? These kilometers must be\r\nmade of india-rubber, there\'s no way out of it."\r\n\r\nEvery three steps he hoisted his knapsack roughly up with a hitch of\r\nhis hips, and panted under its dragging; and all the heap that he made\r\nwith his bundles tossed and creaked like an overloaded wagon.\r\n\r\n"We\'re there," said a non-com.\r\n\r\nNon-coms. always say that, on every occasion. But--in spite of the\r\nnon-com.\'s declaration--we were really arriving in a twilight village\r\nwhich seemed to be drawn in white chalk and heavy strokes of black upon\r\nthe blue paper of the sky, where the sable silhouette of the church--a\r\npointed tower flanked by two turrets more slender and more sharp--was\r\nthat of a tall cypress.\r\n\r\nBut the soldier, even when he enters the village where he is to be\r\nquartered, has not reached the end of his troubles. It rarely happens\r\nthat either the squad or the section actually lodges in the place\r\nassigned to them, and this by reason of misunderstandings and cross\r\npurposes which tangle and disentangle themselves on the spot; and it is\r\nonly after several quarter-hours of tribulation that each man is led to\r\nhis actual shelter of the moment.\r\n\r\nSo after the usual wanderings we were admitted to our night\'s\r\nlodging--a roof supported by four posts, and with the four quarters of\r\nthe compass for its walls. But it was a good roof--an advantage which\r\nwe could appreciate. It was already sheltering a cart and a plow, and\r\nwe settled ourselves by them. Paradis, who had fumed and complained\r\nwithout ceasing during the hour we had spent in tramping to and fro,\r\nthrew down his knapsack and then himself, and stayed there awhile,\r\nweary to the utmost, protesting that his limbs were benumbed, that the\r\nsoles of his feet were painful, and indeed all the rest of him.\r\n\r\nBut now the house to which our hanging roof was subject, the house\r\nwhich stood just in front of us, was lighted up. Nothing attracts a\r\nsoldier in the gray monotony of evening so much as a window whence\r\nbeams the star of a lamp.\r\n\r\n"Shall we have a squint?" proposed Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"So be it," said Paradis. He gets up gradually, and hobbling with\r\nweariness, steers himself towards the golden window that has appeared\r\nin the gloom, and then towards the door. Volpatte follows him, and I\r\nVolpatte.\r\n\r\nWe enter, and ask the old man who has let us in and whose twinkling\r\nhead is as threadbare as an old hat, if he has any wine to sell.\r\n\r\n"No," replies the old man, shaking his head, where a little white fluff\r\ncrops out in places.\r\n\r\n"No beer? No coffee? Anything at all--"\r\n\r\n"No, mes amis, nothing of anything. We don\'t belong here; we\'re\r\nrefugees, you know."\r\n\r\n"Then seeing there\'s nothing, we\'ll be off." We right-about face. At\r\nleast we have enjoyed for a moment the warmth which pervades the house\r\nand a sight of the lamp. Already Volpatte has gained the threshold and\r\nhis back is disappearing in the darkness.\r\n\r\nBut I espy an old woman, sunk in the depths of a chair in the other\r\ncorner of the kitchen, who appears to have some busy occupation.\r\n\r\nI pinch Paradis\' arm. "There\'s the belle of the house. Shall we pay our\r\naddresses to her?"\r\n\r\nParadis makes a gesture of lordly indifference. He has lost interest in\r\nwomen--all those he has seen for a year and a half were not for him;\r\nand moreover, even when they would like to be his, he is equally\r\nuninterested.\r\n\r\n"Young or old--pooh!" he says to me, beginning to yawn. For want of\r\nsomething to do and to lengthen the leaving, he goes up to the\r\ngoodwife. "Good-evening, gran\'ma," he mumbles, finishing his yawn.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening, mes enfants," quavers the old dame. So near, we see her\r\nin detail. She is shriveled, bent and bowed in her old bones, and the\r\nwhole of her face is white as the dial of a clock.\r\n\r\nAnd what is she doing? Wedged between her chair and the edge of the\r\ntable she is trying to clean some boots. It is a heavy task for her\r\ninfantile hands; their movements are uncertain, and her strokes with\r\nthe brush sometimes go astray. The boots, too, are very dirty indeed.\r\n\r\nSeeing that we are watching her, she whispers to us that she must\r\npolish them well, and this evening too, for they are her little girl\'s\r\nboots, who is a dressmaker in the town and goes off first thing in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nParadis has stooped to look at the boots more closely, and suddenly he\r\nputs his hand out towards them. "Drop it, gran\'ma; I\'ll spruce up your\r\nlass\'s trotter-cases for you in three secs."\r\n\r\nThe old woman lodges an objection by shaking her head and her\r\nshoulders. But Paradis takes the boots with authority, while the\r\ngrandmother, paralyzed by her weakness, argues the question and opposes\r\nus with shadowy protest.\r\n\r\nParadis has taken a boot in each hand; he holds them gingerly and looks\r\nat them for a moment, and you would even say that he was squeezing them\r\na little.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t they small!" he says in a voice which is not what we hear in\r\nthe usual way.\r\n\r\nHe has secured the brushes as well, and sets himself to wielding them\r\nwith zealous carefulness. I notice that he is smiling, with his eyes\r\nfixed on his work.\r\n\r\nThen, when the mud has gone from the boots, he takes some polish on the\r\nend of the double-pointed brush and caresses them with it intently.\r\n\r\nThey are dainty boots--quite those of a stylish young lady; rows of\r\nlittle buttons shine on them.\r\n\r\n"Not a single button missing," he whispers to me, and there is pride in\r\nhis tone.\r\n\r\nHe is no longer sleepy; he yawns no more. On the contrary, his lips are\r\ntightly closed; a gleam of youth and spring-time lights up his face;\r\nand he who was on the point of going to sleep seems just to have woke\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAnd where the polish has bestowed a beautiful black his fingers move\r\nover the body of the boot, which opens widely in the upper part and\r\nbetrays--ever such a little--the lower curves of the leg. His fingers,\r\nso skilled in polishing, are rather awkward all the same as they turn\r\nthe boots over and turn them again, as he smiles at them and\r\nponders--profoundly and afar--while the old woman lifts her arms in the\r\nair and calls me to witness "What a very kind soldier!" he is.\r\n\r\nIt is finished. The boots are cleaned and finished off in style; they\r\nare like mirrors. Nothing is left to do.\r\n\r\nHe puts them on the edge of the table, very carefully, as if they were\r\nsaintly relics; then at last his hands let them go. But his eyes do not\r\nat once leave them. He looks at them, and then lowering his head, he\r\nlooks at his own boots. I remember that while he made this comparison\r\nthe great lad--a hero by destiny, a Bohemian, a monk--smiled once more\r\nwith all his heart.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was showing signs of activity in the depths of her chair;\r\nshe had an idea. "I\'ll tell her! She shall thank you herself, monsieur!\r\nHey, Josephine!" she cried, turning towards a door.\r\n\r\nBut Paradis stopped her with an expansive gesture which I thought\r\nmagnificent. "No, it\'s not worth while, gran\'ma; leave her where she\r\nis. We\'re going. We won\'t trouble her, allez!"\r\n\r\nSuch decision sounded in his voice that it carried authority, and the\r\nold woman obediently sank into inactivity and held her peace.\r\n\r\nWe went away to our bed under the wall-less roof, between the arms of\r\nthe plow that was waiting for us. And then Paradis began again to yawn;\r\nbut by the light of the candle in our crib, a full minute later, I saw\r\nthat the happy smile remained yet on his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nIn the Sap\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the excitement of a distribution of letters from which the squad\r\nwere returning--some with the delight of a letter, some with the\r\nsemi-delight of a postcard, and others with a new load (speedily\r\nreassumed) of expectation and hope--a comrade comes with a brandished\r\nnewspaper to tell us an amazing story--"Tu sais, the weasel-faced\r\nancient at Gauchin?"\r\n\r\n"The old boy who was treasure-seeking?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s found it!"\r\n\r\n"Gerraway!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s just as I tell you, you great lump! What would you like me to say\r\nto you? Mass? Don\'t know it. Anyway, the yard of his place has been\r\nbombed, and a chest full of money was turned up out of the ground near\r\na wall. He got his treasure full on the back. And now the parson\'s\r\nquietly cut in and talks about claiming credit for the miracle."\r\n\r\nWe listen open-mouthed. "A treasure--well! well! The old bald-head!"\r\n\r\nThe sudden revelation plunges us in an abyss of reflection. "And to\r\nthink how damned sick we were of the old cackler when he made such a\r\nsong about his treasure and dinned it into our ears!"\r\n\r\n"We were right enough down there, you remember, when we were saying\r\n\'One never knows.\' Didn\'t guess how near we were to being right,\r\neither."\r\n\r\n"All the same, there are some things you can be sure of," says\r\nFarfadet, who as soon as Gauchin was mentioned had remained dreaming\r\nand distant, as though a lovely face was smiling on him. "But as for\r\nthis," he added, "I\'d never have believed it either! Shan\'t I find him\r\nstuck up, the old ruin, when I go back there after the war!"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"They want a willing man to help the sappers with a job," says the big\r\nadjutant.\r\n\r\n"Not likely!" growl the men, without moving.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be of use in relieving the boys," the adjutant goes on.\r\n\r\nWith that the grumbling ceases, and several heads are raised. "Here!"\r\nsays Lamuse.\r\n\r\n"Get into your harness, big \'un, and come with me." Lamuse buckles on\r\nhis knapsack, rolls up his blanket, and fetters his pouches. Since his\r\nseizure of unlucky affection was allayed, he has become more melancholy\r\nthan before, and although a sort of fatality makes him continually\r\nstouter, he has become engrossed and isolated, and rarely speaks.\r\n\r\nIn the evening something comes along the trench, rising and falling\r\naccording to the lumps and holes in the ground; a shape that seems in\r\nthe shadows to be swimming, that outspreads its arms sometimes, as\r\nthough appealing for help. It is Lamuse.\r\n\r\nHe is among us again, covered with mold and mud. He trembles and\r\nstreams with sweat, as one who is afraid. His lips stir, and he gasps,\r\nbefore they can shape a word.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is there?" we ask him vainly.\r\n\r\nHe collapses in a corner among us and prostrates himself. We offer him\r\nwine, and he refuses it with a sign. Then he turns towards me and\r\nbeckons me with a movement of his head.\r\n\r\nWhen I am by him he whispers to me, very low, and as if in church, "I\r\nhave seen Eudoxie again." He gasps for breath, his chest wheezes, and\r\nwith his eyeballs fast fixed upon a nightmare, he says, "She was\r\nputrid."\r\n\r\n"It was the place we\'d lost," Lamuse went on, "and that the Colonials\r\ntook again with the bayonet ten days ago.\r\n\r\n"First we made a hole for the sap, and I was in at it, since I was\r\nscooping more than the others I found myself in front. The others were\r\nwidening and making solid behind. But behold I find a jumble of beams.\r\nI\'d lit on an old trench, caved in, \'vidently; half caved in--there was\r\nsome space and room. In the middle of those stumps of wood all mixed\r\ntogether that I was lifting away one by one from in front of me, there\r\nwas something like a big sandbag in height, upright, and something on\r\nthe top of it hanging down.\r\n\r\n"And behold a plank gives way, and the queer sack falls on me, with its\r\nweight on top. I was pegged down, and the smell of a corpse filled my\r\nthroat--on the top of the bundle there was a head, and it was the hair\r\nthat I\'d seen hanging down.\r\n\r\n"You understand, one couldn\'t see very well; but I recognized the hair\r\n\'cause there isn\'t any other like it in the world, and then the rest of\r\nthe face, all stove in and moldy, the neck pulped, and all the lot dead\r\nfor a month perhaps. It was Eudoxie, I tell you.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was the woman I could never go near before, you know--that I\r\nonly saw a long way off and couldn\'t ever touch, same as diamonds. She\r\nused to run about everywhere, you know. She used even to wander in the\r\nlines. One day she must have stopped a bullet, and stayed there, dead\r\nand lost, until the chance of this sap.\r\n\r\n"You clinch the position? I was forced to hold her up with one arm as\r\nwell as I could, and work with the other. She was trying to fall on me\r\nwith all her weight. Old man, she wanted to kiss me, and I didn\'t\r\nwant--it was terrible. She seemed to be saying to me, \'You wanted to\r\nkiss me, well then, come, come now!\' She had on her--she had there,\r\nfastened on, the remains of a bunch of flowers, and that was rotten,\r\ntoo, and the posy stank in my nose like the corpse of some little beast.\r\n\r\n"I had to take her in my arms, in both of them, and turn gently round\r\nso that I could put her down on the other side. The place was so narrow\r\nand pinched that as we turned, for a moment, I hugged her to my breast\r\nand couldn\'t help it. With all my strength, old chap, as I should have\r\nhugged her once on a time if she\'d have let me.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been half an hour cleaning myself from the touch of her and the\r\nsmell that she breathed on me in spite of me and in spite of herself.\r\nAh, lucky for me that I\'m as done up as a wretched cart-horse!"\r\n\r\nHe turns over on his belly, clenches his fists, and slumbers, with his\r\nface buried in the ground and his dubious dream of passion and\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nA Box of Matches\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is five o\'clock in the evening. Three men are seen moving in the\r\nbottom of the gloomy trench. Around their extinguished fire in the\r\ndirty excavation they are frightful to see, black and sinister. Rain\r\nand negligence have put their fire out, and the four cooks are looking\r\nat the corpses of brands that are shrouded in ashes and the stumps of\r\nwood whence the flame has flown.\r\n\r\nVolpatte staggers up to the group and throws down the black mass that\r\nhe had on his shoulder. "I\'ve pulled it out of a dug-out where it won\'t\r\nshow much."\r\n\r\n"We have wood," says Blaire, "but we\'ve got to light it. Otherwise, how\r\nare we going to cook this cab-horse?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fine piece," wails a dark-faced man, "thin flank. In my belief,\r\nthat\'s the best bit of the beast, the flank."\r\n\r\n"Fire?" Volpatte objects, "there are no more matches, no more anything."\r\n\r\n"We must have fire," growls Poupardin, whose indistinct bulk has the\r\nproportions of a bear as he rolls and sways in the dark depths of our\r\ncage.\r\n\r\n"No two ways about it, we\'ve got to have it," Pepin agrees. He is\r\ncoming out of a dug-out like a sweep out of a chimney. His gray mass\r\nemerges and appears, like night upon evening.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry; I shall get some," declares Blaire in a concentrated tone\r\nof angry decision. He has not been cook long, and is keen to show\r\nhimself quite equal to adverse conditions in the exercise of his\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nHe spoke as Martin Cesar used to speak when he was alive. His aim is to\r\nresemble the great legendary figure of the cook who always found ways\r\nfor a fire, just as others, among the non-coms., would fain imitate\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\n"I shall go if it\'s necessary and fetch every bit of wood there is at\r\nBattalion H.Q. I shall go and requisition the colonel\'s matches--I\r\nshall go--"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go and forage." Poupardin leads the way. His face is like the\r\nbottom of a saucepan that the fire has gradually befouled. As it is\r\ncruelly cold, he is wrapped up all over. He wears a cape which is half\r\ngoatskin and half sheepskin, half brown and half whitish, and this\r\ntwofold skin of tints geometrically cut makes him like some strange\r\noccult animal.\r\n\r\nPepin has a cotton cap so soiled and so shiny with grease that it might\r\nbe made of black silk. Volpatte, inside his Balaklava and his fleeces,\r\nresembles a walking tree-trunk. A square opening betrays a yellow face\r\nat the top of the thick and heavy bark of the mass he makes, which is\r\nbifurcated by a couple of legs.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s look up the 10th. They\'ve always got the needful. They\'re on the\r\nPylones road, beyond the Boyau-Neuf."\r\n\r\nThe four alarming objects get under way, cloud-shape, in the trench\r\nthat unwinds itself sinuously before them like a blind alley, unsafe,\r\nunlighted, and unpaved. It is uninhabited, too, in this part, being a\r\ngangway between the second lines and the first lines.\r\n\r\nIn the dusty twilight two Moroccans meet the fire-questing cooks. One\r\nhas the skin of a black boot and the other of a yellow shoe. Hope\r\ngleams in the depths of the cooks\' hearts.\r\n\r\n"Matches, boys?"\r\n\r\n"Napoo," replies the black one, and his smile reveals his long\r\ncrockery-like teeth in his cigar-colored mouth of moroccan leather.\r\n\r\nIn his turn the yellow one advances and asks, "Tobacco? A bit of\r\ntobacco?" And he holds out his greenish sleeve and his great hard paw,\r\nin which the cracks are full of brown dirt, and the nails purplish.\r\n\r\nPepin growls, rummages in his clothes, and pulls out a pinch of\r\ntobacco, mixed with dust, which he hands to the sharpshooter.\r\n\r\nA little farther they meet a sentry who is half asleep--in the middle\r\nof the evening--on a heap of loose earth. The drowsy soldier says,\r\n"It\'s to the right, and then again to the right, and then straight\r\nforward. Don\'t go wrong about it."\r\n\r\nThey march--for a long time. "We must have come a long way," says\r\nVolpatte, after half an hour of fruitless paces and encloistered\r\nloneliness.\r\n\r\n"I say, we\'re going downhill a hell of a lot, don\'t you think?" asks\r\nBlaire.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, old duffer," scoffs Pepin, "but if you\'ve got cold feet\r\nyou can leave us to it."\r\n\r\nStill we tramp on in the falling night. The ever-empty trench--a desert\r\nof terrible length--has taken a shabby and singular appearance. The\r\nparapets are in ruins; earthslides have made the ground undulate in\r\nhillocks.\r\n\r\nAn indefinite uneasiness lays hold of the four huge fire-hunters, and\r\nincreases as night overwhelms them in this monstrous road.\r\n\r\nPepin, who is leading just now, stands fast and holds up his hand as a\r\nsignal to halt. "Footsteps," they say in a sobered tone.\r\n\r\nThen, and in the heart of them, they are afraid. It was a mistake for\r\nthem all to leave their shelter for so long. They are to blame. And one\r\nnever knows.\r\n\r\n"Get in there, quick, quick!" says Pepin, pointing to a right-angled\r\ncranny on the ground level.\r\n\r\nBy the test of a hand, the rectangular shadow is proved to be the entry\r\nto a funk-hole. They crawl in singly; and the last one, impatient,\r\npushes the others; they become an involuntary carpet in the dense\r\ndarkness of the hole.\r\n\r\nA sound of steps and of voices becomes distinct and draws nearer. From\r\nthe mass of the four men who tightly hung up the burrow, tentative\r\nhands are put out at a venture. All at once Pepin murmurs in a stifled\r\nvoice, "What\'s this?"\r\n\r\n"What?" ask the others, pressed and wedged against him.\r\n\r\n"Clips!" says Pepin under his breath, "Boche cartridge-clips on the\r\nshelf! We\'re in the Boche trench!"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s hop it." Three men make a jump to get out.\r\n\r\n"Look out, bon Dieu! Don\'t stir!--footsteps--"\r\n\r\nThey hear some one walking, with the quick step of a solitary man. They\r\nkeep still and hold their breath. With their eyes fixed on the ground\r\nlevel, they see the darkness moving on the right, and then a shadow\r\nwith legs detaches itself, approaches, and passes. The shadow assumes\r\nan outline. It is topped by a helmet covered with a cloth and rising to\r\na point. There is no other sound than that of his passing feet.\r\n\r\nHardly has the German gone by when the four cooks, with no concerted\r\nplan and with a single movement, burst forth, jostling each other, run\r\nlike madmen, and hurl themselves on him.\r\n\r\n"Kamerad, messieurs!" he says.\r\n\r\nBut the blade of a knife gleams and disappears. The man collapses as if\r\nhe would plunge into the ground. Pepin seizes the helmet as the Boche\r\nis failing and keeps it in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s leg it," growls the voice of Poupardin.\r\n\r\n"Got to search him first!"\r\n\r\nThey lift him and turn him over, and set the soft, damp and warm body\r\nup again. Suddenly he coughs.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t dead!"--"Yes, he is dead; that\'s the air."\r\n\r\nThey shake him by the pockets; with hasty breathing the four black men\r\nstoop over their task. "The helmet\'s mine," says Pepin. "It was me that\r\nknifed him, I want the helmet."\r\n\r\nThey tear from the body its pocket-book of still warm papers, its\r\nfield-glass, purse, and leggings.\r\n\r\n"Matches!" shouts Blaire, shaking a box, "he\'s got some!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, the fool that you are!" hisses Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"Now let\'s be off like hell." They pile the body in a corner and break\r\ninto a run, prey to a sort of panic, and regardless of the row their\r\ndisordered flight makes.\r\n\r\n"It\'s this way!--This way!--Hurry, lads--for all you\'re worth!"\r\n\r\nWithout speaking they dash across the maze of the strangely empty\r\ntrench that seems to have no end.\r\n\r\n"My wind\'s gone," says Blaire, "I\'m--" He staggers and stops.\r\n\r\n"Come on, buck up, old chap," gasps Pepin, hoarse and breathless. He\r\ntakes him by the sleeve and drags him forward like a stubborn\r\nshaft-horse.\r\n\r\n"We\'re right!" says Poupardin suddenly. "Yes, I remember that tree.\r\nIt\'s the Pylones road!"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" wails Blaire, whose breathing is shaking him like an engine. He\r\nthrows himself forward with a last impulse--and sits down on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Halt!" cries a sentry--"Good Lord!" he stammers as he sees the four\r\npoilus. "Where the--where are you coming from, that way?"\r\n\r\nThey laugh, jump about like puppets, full-blooded and streaming with\r\nperspiration, blacker than ever in the night. The German officer\'s\r\nhelmet is gleaming in the hands of Pepin. "Oh, Christ!" murmurs the\r\nsentry, with gaping mouth, "but what\'s been up?"\r\n\r\nAn exuberant reaction excites and bewitches them. All talk at once. In\r\nhaste and confusion they act again the drama which hardly yet they\r\nrealize is over. They had gone wrong when they left the sleepy sentry\r\nand had taken the International Trench, of which a part is ours and\r\nanother part German. Between the French and German sections there is no\r\nbarricade or division. There is merely a sort of neutral zone, at the\r\ntwo ends of which sentries watch ceaselessly. No doubt the German\r\nwatcher was not at his post, or likely he hid himself when he saw the\r\nfour shadows, or perhaps be doubled back and had not time to bring up\r\nreinforcements. Or perhaps, too, the German officer had strayed too far\r\nahead in the neutral zone. In short, one understands what happened\r\nwithout understanding it.\r\n\r\n"The funny part of it," says Pepin, "is that we knew all about that,\r\nand never thought to be careful about it when we set off."\r\n\r\n"We were looking for matches," says Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"And we\'ve got some!" cries Pepin. "You\'ve not lost the flamers, old\r\nbroomstick?"\r\n\r\n"No damned fear!" says Blaire; "Boche matches are better stuff than\r\nours. Besides, they\'re all we\'ve got to light our fire! Lose my box?\r\nLet any one try to pinch it off me!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re behind time--the soup-water\'ll be freezing. Hurry up, so far.\r\nAfterwards there\'ll be a good yarn to tell in the sewer where the boys\r\nare, about what we did to the Boches."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nBombardment\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are in the flat country, a vast mistiness, but above it is dark\r\nblue. The end of the night is marked by a little falling snow which\r\npowders our shoulders and the folds in our sleeves. We are marching in\r\nfours, hooded. We seem in the turbid twilight to be the wandering\r\nsurvivors of one Northern district who are trekking to another.\r\n\r\nWe have followed a road and have crossed the ruins of\r\nAblain-Saint-Nazaire. We have had confused glimpses of its whitish\r\nheaps of houses and the dim spider-webs of its suspended roofs. The\r\nvillage is so long that although full night buried us in it we saw its\r\nlast buildings beginning to pale in the frost of dawn. Through the\r\ngrating of a cellar on the edge of this petrified ocean\'s waves, we\r\nmade out the fire kept going by the custodians of the dead town. We\r\nhave paddled in swampy fields, lost ourselves in silent places where\r\nthe mud seized us by the feet, we have dubiously regained our balance\r\nand our bearings again on another road, the one which leads from\r\nCarency to Souchez. The tall bordering poplars are shivered and their\r\ntrunks mangled; in one place the road is an enormous colonnade of trees\r\ndestroyed. Then, marching with us on both sides, we see through the\r\nshadows ghostly dwarfs of trees, wide-cloven like spreading palms;\r\nbotched and jumbled into round blocks or long strips; doubled upon\r\nthemselves, as if they knelt. From time to time our march is disordered\r\nand bustled by the yielding of a swamp. The road becomes a marsh which\r\nwe cross on our heels, while our feet make the sound of sculling.\r\nPlanks have been laid in it here and there. Where they have so far sunk\r\nin the mud as to proffer their edges to us we slip on them. Sometimes\r\nthere is enough water to float them, and then under the weight of a man\r\nthey splash and go under, and the man stumbles or falls, with frenzied\r\nimprecations.\r\n\r\nIt must be five o\'clock. The stark and affrighting scene unfolds itself\r\nto our eyes, but it is still encircled by a great fantastic ring of\r\nmist and of darkness. We go on and on without pause, and come to a\r\nplace where we can make out a dark hillock, at the foot of which there\r\nseems to be some lively movement of human beings.\r\n\r\n"Advance by twos," says the leader of the detachment. "Let each team of\r\ntwo take alternately a plank and a hurdle." We load ourselves up. One\r\nof the two in each couple assumes the rifle of his partner as well as\r\nhis own. The other with difficulty shifts and pulls out from the pile a\r\nlong plank, muddy and slippery, which weighs full eighty pounds, or a\r\nhurdle of leafy branches as big as a door, which he can only just keep\r\non his back as he bends forward with his hands aloft and grips its\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nWe resume our march, very slowly and very ponderously, scattered over\r\nthe now graying road, with complaints and heavy curses which the effort\r\nstrangles in our throats. After about a hundred yards, the two men of\r\neach team exchange loads, so that after two hundred yards, in spite of\r\nthe bitter blenching breeze of early morning, all but the non-coms. are\r\nrunning with sweat.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a vivid star expands down yonder in the uncertain direction\r\nthat we are taking--a rocket. Widely it lights a part of the sky with\r\nits milky nimbus, blots out the stars, and then falls gracefully,\r\nfairy-like.\r\n\r\nThere is a swift light opposite us over there; a flash and a\r\ndetonation. It is a shell! By the flat reflection that the explosion\r\ninstantaneously spreads over the lower sky we see a ridge clearly\r\noutlined in front of us from east to west, perhaps half a mile away.\r\n\r\nThat ridge is ours--so much of it as we can see from here and up to the\r\ntop of it, where our troops are. On the other slope, a hundred yards\r\nfrom our first line, is the first German line. The shell fell on the\r\nsummit, in our lines; it is the others who are firing. Another shell\r\nanother and yet another plant trees of faintly violet light on the top\r\nof the rise, and each of them dully illumines the whole of the horizon.\r\n\r\nSoon there is a sparkling of brilliant stars and a sudden jungle of\r\nfiery plumes on the hill; and a fairy mirage of blue and white hangs\r\nlightly before our eyes in the full gulf of night.\r\n\r\nThose among us who must devote the whole buttressed power of their arms\r\nand legs to prevent their greasy loads from sliding off their backs and\r\nto prevent themselves from sliding to the ground, these neither see nor\r\nhear anything. The others, sniffing and shivering with cold, wiping\r\ntheir noses with limp and sodden handkerchiefs, watch and remark,\r\ncursing the obstacles in the way with fragments of profanity. "It\'s\r\nlike watching fireworks," they say.\r\n\r\nAnd to complete the illusion of a great operatic scene, fairy-like but\r\nsinister, before which our bent and black party crawls and splashes,\r\nbehold a red star, and then a green; then a sheaf of red fire, very\r\nmuch tardier. In our ranks, as the available half of our pairs of eyes\r\nwatch the display, we cannot help murmuring in idle tones of popular\r\nadmiration, "Ah, a red one!"--"Look, a green one!" It is the Germans\r\nwho are sending up signals, and our men as well who are asking for\r\nartillery support.\r\n\r\nOur road turns and climbs again as the day at last decides to appear.\r\nEverything looks dirty. A layer of stickiness, pearl-gray and white,\r\ncovers the road, and around it the real world makes a mournful\r\nappearance. Behind us we leave ruined Souchez, whose houses are only\r\nflat heaps of rubbish and her trees but humps of bramble-like slivers.\r\nWe plunge into a hole on our left, the entrance to the communication\r\ntrench. We let our loads fall in a circular enclosure prepared for\r\nthem, and both hot and frozen we settled in the trench and wait our\r\nhands abraded, wet, and stiff with cramp.\r\n\r\nBuried in our holes up to the chin, our chests heaving against the\r\nsolid bulk of the ground that protects us, we watch the dazzling and\r\ndeepening drama develop. The bombardment is redoubled. The trees of\r\nlight on the ridge have melted into hazy parachutes in the pallor of\r\ndawn, sickly heads of Medusae with points of fire; then, more sharply\r\ndefined as the day expands, they become bunches of smoke-feathers,\r\nostrich feathers white and gray, which come suddenly to life on the\r\njumbled and melancholy soil of Hill 119, five or six hundred yards in\r\nfront of us, and then slowly fade away. They are truly the pillar of\r\nfire and the pillar of cloud, circling as one and thundering together.\r\nOn the flank of the hill we see a party of men running to earth. One by\r\none they disappear, swallowed up in the adjoining anthills.\r\n\r\nNow, one can better make out the form of our "guests." At each shot a\r\ntuft of sulphurous white underlined in black forms sixty yards up in\r\nthe air, unfolds and mottles itself, and we catch in the explosion the\r\nwhistling of the charge of bullets that the yellow cloud hurls angrily\r\nto the ground. It bursts in sixfold squalls, one after another--bang,\r\nbang, bang, bang, bang, bang. It is the 77 mm. gun.\r\n\r\nWe disdain the 77 mm. shrapnel, in spite of the fact that Blesbois was\r\nkilled by one of them three days ago. They nearly always burst too\r\nhigh. Barque explains it to us, although we know it well: "One\'s\r\nchamber-pot protects one\'s nut well enough against the bullets. So they\r\ncan destroy your shoulder and damn well knock you down, but they don\'t\r\nspread you about. Naturally, you\'ve got to be fly, all the same. Got to\r\nbe careful you don\'t lift your neb in the air as long as they\'re\r\nbuzzing about, nor put your hand out to see if it\'s raining. Now, our\r\n75 mm.--"\r\n\r\n"There aren\'t only the 77\'s," Mesnil Andre broke in, "there\'s all\r\ndamned sorts. Spell those out for me--" Those are shrill and cutting\r\nwhistles, trembling or rattling; and clouds of all shapes gather on the\r\nslopes yonder whose vastness shows through them, slopes where our men\r\nare in the depths of the dug-outs. Gigantic plumes of faint fire mingle\r\nwith huge tassels of steam, tufts that throw out straight filaments,\r\nsmoky feathers that expand as they fall--quite white or greenish-gray,\r\nblack or copper with gleams of gold, or as if blotched with ink.\r\n\r\nThe two last explosions are quite near. Above the battered ground they\r\ntake shape like vast balls of black and tawny dust; and as they deploy\r\nand leisurely depart at the wind\'s will, having finished their task,\r\nthey have the outline of fabled dragons.\r\n\r\nOur line of faces on the level of the ground turns that way, and we\r\nfollow them with our eyes from the bottom of the trench in the middle\r\nof this country peopled by blazing and ferocious apparitions, these\r\nfields that the sky has crushed.\r\n\r\n"Those, they\'re the 150 mm. howitzers."--"They\'re the 210\'s,\r\ncalf-head."--"There go the regular guns, too; the hogs! Look at that\r\none!" It was a shell that burst on the ground and threw up earth and\r\ndebris in a fan-shaped cloud of darkness. Across the cloven land it\r\nlooked like the frightful spitting of some volcano, piled up in the\r\nbowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nA diabolical uproar surrounds us. We are conscious of a sustained\r\ncrescendo, an incessant multiplication of the universal frenzy. A\r\nhurricane of hoarse and hollow banging, of raging clamor, of piercing\r\nand beast-like screams, fastens furiously with tatters of smoke upon\r\nthe earth where we are buried up to our necks, and the wind of the\r\nshells seems to set it heaving and pitching.\r\n\r\n"Look at that," bawls Barque, "and me that said they were short of\r\nmunitions!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, la, la! We know all about that! That and the other fudge the\r\nnewspapers squirt all over us!"\r\n\r\nA dull crackle makes itself audible amidst the babel of noise. That\r\nslow rattle is of all the sounds of war the one that most quickens the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"The coffee-mill! [note 1] One of ours, listen. The shots come\r\nregularly, while the Boches\' haven\'t got the same length of time\r\nbetween the shots; they go\r\ncrack--crack-crack-crack--crack-crack--crack--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cod yourself, crack-pate; it isn\'t an unsewing-machine at all;\r\nit\'s a motor-cycle on the road to 31 dugout, away yonder."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think it\'s a chap up aloft there, having a look round from his\r\nbroomstick," chuckles Pepin, as he raises his nose and sweeps the\r\nfirmament in search of an aeroplane.\r\n\r\nA discussion arises, but one cannot say what the noise is, and that\'s\r\nall. One tries in vain to become familiar with all those diverse\r\ndisturbances. It even happened the other day in the wood that a whole\r\nsection mistook for the hoarse howl of a shell the first notes of a\r\nneighboring mule as he began his whinnying bray.\r\n\r\n"I say, there\'s a good show of sausages in the air this morning," says\r\nLamuse. Lifting our eyes, we count them.\r\n\r\n"There are eight sausages on our side and eight on the Boches\'," says\r\nCocon, who has already counted them.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, at regular intervals along the horizon, opposite\r\nthe distance-dwindled group of captive enemy balloons, the eight long\r\nhovering eyes of the army, buoyant and sensitive, and joined to the\r\nvarious headquarters by living threads.\r\n\r\n"They see us as we see them. How the devil can one escape from that row\r\nof God Almighties up there?"\r\n\r\nThere\'s our reply!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, behind our backs, there bursts the sharp and deafening\r\nstridor of the 75\'s. Their increasing crackling thunder arouses and\r\nelates us. We shout with our guns, and look at each other without\r\nhearing our shouts--except for the curiously piercing voice that comes\r\nfrom Barque\'s great mouth--amid the rolling of that fantastic drum\r\nwhose every note is the report of a cannon.\r\n\r\nThen we turn our eyes ahead and outstretch our necks, and on the top of\r\nthe hill we see the still higher silhouette of a row of black infernal\r\ntrees whose terrible roots are striking down into the invisible slope\r\nwhere the enemy cowers.\r\n\r\nWhile the "75" battery continues its barking a hundred yards behind\r\nus--the sharp anvil-blows of a huge hammer, followed by a dizzy scream\r\nof force and fury--a gigantic gurgling dominates the devilish oratorio;\r\nthat, also, is coming from our side. "It\'s a gran\'pa, that one!"\r\n\r\nThe shell cleaves the air at perhaps a thousand yards above us; the\r\nvoice of its gun covers all as with a pavilion of resonance. The sound\r\nof its travel is sluggish, and one divines a projectile bigger-boweled,\r\nmore enormous than the others. We can hear it passing and declining in\r\nfront with the ponderous and increasing vibration of a train that\r\nenters a station under brakes; then, its heavy whine sounds fainter. We\r\nwatch the hill opposite, and after several seconds it is covered by a\r\nsalmon-pink cloud that the wind spreads over one-half of the horizon.\r\n"It\'s a 220 mm."\r\n\r\n"One can see them," declares Volpatte, "those shells, when they come\r\nout of the gun. If you\'re in the right line, you can even see them a\r\ngood long away from the gun."\r\n\r\nAnother follows: "There! Look, look! Did you see that one? You didn\'t\r\nlook quick enough, you missed it. Get a move on! Look, another! Did you\r\nsee it?"\r\n\r\n"I did not see it."--"Ass! Got to be a bedstead for you to see it!\r\nLook, quick, that one, there! Did you see it, unlucky\r\ngood-for-nothing?"--"I saw it; is that all?"\r\n\r\nSome have made out a small black object, slender and pointed as a\r\nblackbird with folded wings, pricking a wide curve down from the zenith.\r\n\r\n"That weighs 240 lb., that one, my old bug," says Volpatte proudly,\r\n"and when that drops on a funk-hole it kills everybody inside it. Those\r\nthat aren\'t picked off by the explosion are struck dead by the wind of\r\nit, or they\'re gas-poisoned before they can say \'ouf!\'"\r\n\r\n"The 270 mm. shell can be seen very well, too--talk about a bit of\r\niron--when the howitzer sends it up--allez, off you go!"\r\n\r\n"And the 155 Rimailho, too; but you can\'t see that one because it goes\r\ntoo straight and too far; the more you look for it the more it vanishes\r\nbefore your eyes."\r\n\r\nIn a stench of sulphur amid black powder, of burned stuffs and calcined\r\nearth which roams in sheets about the country, all the menagerie is let\r\nloose and gives battle. Bellowings, roarings, growlings, strange and\r\nsavage; feline caterwaulings that fiercely rend your ears and search\r\nyour belly, or the long-drawn piercing hoot like the siren of a ship in\r\ndistress. At times, even, something like shouts cross each other in the\r\nair-currents, with curious variation of tone that make the sound human.\r\nThe country is bodily lifted in places and falls back again. From one\r\nend of the horizon to the other it seems to us that the earth itself is\r\nraging with storm and tempest.\r\n\r\nAnd the greatest guns, far away and still farther, diffuse growls much\r\nsubdued and smothered, but you know the strength of them by the\r\ndisplacement of air which comes and raps you on the ear.\r\n\r\nNow, behold a heavy mass of woolly green which expands and hovers over\r\nthe bombarded region and draws out in every direction. This touch of\r\nstrangely incongruous color in the picture summons attention, and all\r\nwe encaged prisoners turn our faces towards the hideous outcrop.\r\n\r\n"Gas, probably. Let\'s have our masks ready."--"The hogs!"\r\n\r\n"They\'re unfair tricks, those," says Farfadet.\r\n\r\n"They\'re what?" asks Barque jeeringly.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, they\'re dirty dodges, those gases--"\r\n\r\n"You make me tired," retorts Barque, "with your fair ways and your\r\nunfair ways. When you\'ve seen men squashed, cut in two, or divided from\r\ntop to bottom, blown into showers by an ordinary shell, bellies turned\r\ninside out and scattered anyhow, skulls forced bodily into the chest as\r\nif by a blow with a club, and in place of the head a bit of neck,\r\noozing currant jam of brains all over the chest and back--you\'ve seen\r\nthat and yet you can say \'There are clean ways!\'"\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t alter the fact that the shell is allowed, it\'s recognized--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, la, la! I\'ll tell you what--you make me blubber just as much as\r\nyou make me laugh!" And he turns his back.\r\n\r\n"Hey, look out, boys!"\r\n\r\nWe strain our eyes, and one of us has thrown himself flat on the\r\nground; others look instinctively and frowning towards the shelter that\r\nwe have not time to reach, and during these two seconds each one bends\r\nhis head. It is a grating noise as of huge scissors which comes near\r\nand nearer to us, and ends at last with a ringing crash of unloaded\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThat ore fell not far from us--two hundred yards away, perhaps. We\r\ncrouch in the bottom of the trench and remain doubled up while the\r\nplace where we are is lashed by a shower of little fragments.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want this in my tummy, even from that distance," says Paradis,\r\nextracting from the earth of the trench wall a morsel that has just\r\nlodged there. It is like a bit of coke, bristling with edged and\r\npointed facets, and he dances it in his hand so as not to burn himself.\r\n\r\nThere is a hissing noise. Paradis sharply bows his head and we follow\r\nsuit. "The fuse!--it has gone over." The shrapnel fuse goes up and then\r\ncomes down vertically; but that of the percussion shell detaches itself\r\nfrom the broken mass after the explosion and usually abides buried at\r\nthe point of contact, but at other times it flies off at random like a\r\nbig red-hot pebble. One must beware of it. It may hurl itself on you a\r\nvery long time after the detonation and by incredible paths, passing\r\nover the embankment and plunging into the cavities.\r\n\r\n"Nothing so piggish as a fuse. It happened to me once--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s worse things," broke in Bags of the 11th, "The Austrian\r\nshells, the 130\'s and the 74\'s. I\'m afraid of them. They\'re\r\nnickel-plated, they say, but what I do know, seeing I\'ve been there, is\r\nthey come so quick you can\'t do anything to dodge them. You no sooner\r\nhear em snoring than they burst on you.\r\n\r\n"The German 105\'s, neither, you haven\'t hardly the time to flatten\r\nyourself. I once got the gunners to tell me all about them."\r\n\r\n"I tell you, the shells from the naval guns, you haven\'t the time to\r\nhear \'em. Got to pack yourself up before they come."\r\n\r\n"And there\'s that new shell, a dirty devil, that breaks wind after it\'s\r\ndodged into the earth and out of it again two or three times in the\r\nspace of six yards. When I know there\'s one of them about, I want to go\r\nround the corner. I remember one time--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all nothing, my lads," said the new sergeant, stopping on his\r\nway past, "you ought to see what they chucked us at Verdun, where I\'ve\r\ncome from. Nothing but whoppers, 380\'s and 420\'s and 244\'s. When you\'ve\r\nbeen shelled down there you know all about it--the woods are sliced\r\ndown like cornfields, the dug-outs marked and burst in even when\r\nthey\'ve three thicknesses of beams, all the road-crossings sprinkled,\r\nthe roads blown into the air and changed into long heaps of smashed\r\nconvoys and wrecked guns, corpses twisted together as though shoveled\r\nup. You could see thirty chaps laid out by one shot at the cross-roads;\r\nyou could see fellows whirling around as they went up, always about\r\nfifteen yards, and bits of trousers caught and stuck on the tops of the\r\ntrees that were left. You could see one of these 380\'s go into a house\r\nat Verdun by the roof, bore through two or three floors, and burst at\r\nthe bottom, and all the damn lot\'s got to go aloft; and in the fields\r\nwhole battalions would scatter and lie flat under the shower like poor\r\nlittle defenseless rabbits. At every step on the ground in the fields\r\nyou\'d got lumps as thick as your arm and as wide as that, and it\'d take\r\nfour poilus to lift the lump of iron. The fields looked as if they were\r\nfull of rocks. And that went on without a halt for months on end,\r\nmonths on end!" the sergeant repeated as he passed on, no doubt to tell\r\nagain the story of his souvenirs somewhere else.\r\n\r\n"Look, look, corporal, those chaps over there--are they soft in the\r\nhead?" On the bombarded position we saw dots of human beings emerge\r\nhurriedly and run towards the explosions.\r\n\r\n"They\'re gunners," said Bertrand; "as soon as a shell\'s burst they\r\nsprint and rummage for the fuse in the hole, for the position of the\r\nfuse gives the direction of its battery, you see, by the way it\'s dug\r\nitself in; and as for the distance, you\'ve only got to read it--it\'s\r\nshown on the range-figures cut on the time-fuse which is set just\r\nbefore firing."\r\n\r\n"No matter--they\'re off their onions to go out under such shelling."\r\n\r\n"Gunners, my boy," says a man of another company who was strolling in\r\nthe trench, "are either quite good or quite bad. Either they\'re trumps\r\nor they\'re trash. I tell you--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true of all privates, what you\'re saying."\r\n\r\n"Possibly; but I\'m not talking to you about all privates; I\'m talking\r\nto you about gunners, and I tell you too that--"\r\n\r\n"Hey, my lads! Better find a hole to dump yourselves in, before you get\r\none on the snitch!"\r\n\r\nThe strolling stranger carried his story away, and Cocon, who was in a\r\nperverse mood, declared: "We can be doing our hair in the dug-out,\r\nseeing it\'s rather boring outside."\r\n\r\n"Look, they\'re sending torpedoes over there!" said Paradis, pointing.\r\nTorpedoes go straight up, or very nearly so, like larks, fluttering and\r\nrustling; then they stop, hesitate, and come straight down again,\r\nheralding their fall in its last seconds by a "baby-cry" that we know\r\nwell. From here, the inhabitants of the ridge seem like invisible\r\nplayers, lined up for a game with a ball.\r\n\r\n"In the Argonne," says Lamuse, "my brother says in a letter that they\r\nget turtle-doves, as he calls them. They\'re big heavy things, fired off\r\nvery close. They come in cooing, really they do, he says, and when they\r\nbreak wind they don\'t half make a shindy, he says."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing worse than the mortar-toad, that seems to chase after\r\nyou and jump over the top of you, and it bursts in the very trench,\r\njust scraping over the bank."\r\n\r\n"Tiens, tiens, did you hear it?" A whistling was approaching us when\r\nsuddenly it ceased. The contrivance has not burst. "It\'s a shell that\r\ncried off," Paradis asserts. And we strain our ears for the\r\nsatisfaction of hearing--or of not hearing--others.\r\n\r\nLamuse says: "All the fields and the roads and the villages about here,\r\nthey\'re covered with dud shells of all sizes--ours as well, to say\r\ntruth. The ground must be full of \'em, that you can\'t see. I wonder how\r\nthey\'ll go on, later, when the time comes to say, \'That\'s enough of it,\r\nlet\'s start work again.\'"\r\n\r\nAnd all the time, in a monotony of madness, the avalanche of fire and\r\niron goes on; shrapnel with its whistling explosion and its overcharged\r\nheart of furious metal and the great percussion shells, whose thunder\r\nis that of the railway engine which crashes suddenly into a wall, the\r\nthunder of loaded rails or steel beams, toppling down a declivity. The\r\nair is now glutted and viewless, it is crossed and recrossed by heavy\r\nblasts, and the murder of the earth continues all around, deeply and\r\nmore deeply, to the limit of completion.\r\n\r\nThere are even other guns which now join in--they are ours. Their\r\nreport is like that of the 75\'s, but louder, and it has a prolonged and\r\nresounding echo, like thunder reverberating among mountains.\r\n\r\n"They\'re the long 120\'s. They\'re on the edge of the wood half a mile\r\naway. Fine guns, old man, like gray-hounds. They\'re slender and\r\nfine-nosed, those guns--you want to call them \'Madame.\' They\'re not\r\nlike the 220\'s--they\'re all snout, like coal-scuttles, and spit their\r\nshells out from the bottom upwards. The 120\'s get there just the same,\r\nbut among the teams of artillery they look like kids in bassinettes."\r\n\r\nConversation languishes; here and there are yawns. The dimensions and\r\nweight of this outbreak of the guns fatigue the mind. Our voices\r\nflounder in it and are drowned.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never seen anything like this for a bombardment," shouts Barque.\r\n\r\n"We always say that," replies Paradis.\r\n\r\n"Just so," bawls Volpatte. "There\'s been talk of an attack lately; I\r\nshould say this is the beginning of something."\r\n\r\nThe others say simply, "Ah!"\r\n\r\nVolpatte displays an intention of snatching a wink of sleep. He settles\r\nhimself on the ground with his back against one wall of the trench and\r\nhis feet buttressed against the other wall.\r\n\r\nWe converse together on divers subjects. Biquet tells the story of a\r\nrat he has seen: "He was cheeky and comical, you know. I\'d taken off my\r\ntrotter-cases, and that rat, he chewed all the edge of the uppers into\r\nembroidery. Of course, I\'d greased \'em."\r\n\r\nVolpatte, who is now definitely out of action, moves and says, "I can\'t\r\nget to sleep for your gabbling."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t make me believe, old fraud," says Marthereau, "that you can\r\nraise a single snore with a shindy like this all round you."\r\n\r\nVolpatte replies with one.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nFall in! March!\r\n\r\nWe are changing our spot. Where are they taking us to? We have no idea.\r\nThe most we know is that we are in reserve, and that they may take us\r\nround to strengthen certain points in succession, or to clear the\r\ncommunication trenches, in which the regulation of passing troops is as\r\ncomplicated a job, if blocks and collisions are to be avoided, as it is\r\nof the trains in a busy station. It is impossible to make out the\r\nmeaning of the immense maneuver in which the rolling of our regiment is\r\nonly that of a little wheel, nor what is going on in all the huge area\r\nof the sector. But, lost in the network of deeps where we go and come\r\nwithout end, weary, harassed and stiff-jointed by prolonged halts,\r\nstupefied by noise and delay, poisoned by smoke, we make out that our\r\nartillery is becoming more and more active; the offensive seems to have\r\nchanged places.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nHalt! A fire of intense and incredible fury was threshing the parapets\r\nof the trench where we were halted at the moment: "Fritz is going it\r\nstrong; he\'s afraid of an attack, he\'s going dotty. Ah, isn\'t he\r\nletting fly!"\r\n\r\nA heavy hail was pouring over us, hacking terribly at atmosphere and\r\nsky, scraping and skimming all the plain.\r\n\r\nI looked through a loophole and saw a swift and strange vision. In\r\nfront of us, a dozen yards away at most, there were motionless forms\r\noutstretched side by side--a row of mown-down soldiers--and the\r\ncountless projectiles that hurtled from all sides were riddling this\r\nrank of the dead!\r\n\r\nThe bullets that flayed the soil in straight streaks amid raised\r\nslender stems of cloud were perforating and ripping the bodies so\r\nrigidly close to the ground, breaking the stiffened limbs, plunging\r\ninto the wan and vacant faces, bursting and bespattering the liquefied\r\neyes; and even did that file of corpses stir and budge out of line\r\nunder the avalanche.\r\n\r\nWe could hear the blunt sound of the dizzy copper points as they\r\npierced cloth and flesh, the sound of a furious stroke with a knife,\r\nthe harsh blow of a stick upon clothing. Above us rushed jets of shrill\r\nwhistling, with the declining and far more serious hum of ricochets.\r\nAnd we bent our heads under the enormous flight of noises and voices.\r\n\r\n"Trench must be cleared--Gee up!" We leave this most infamous corner of\r\nthe battlefield where even the dead are torn, wounded, and slain anew.\r\n\r\nWe turn towards the right and towards the rear. The communication\r\ntrench rises, and at the top of the gully we pass in front of a\r\ntelephone station and a group of artillery officers and gunners. Here\r\nthere is a further halt. We mark time, and hear the artillery observer\r\nshout his commands, which the telephonist buried beside him picks up\r\nand repeats: "First gun, same sight; two-tenths to left; three a\r\nminute!"\r\n\r\nSome of us have risked our heads over the edge of the bank and have\r\nglimpsed for the space of the lightning\'s flash all the field of battle\r\nround which our company has uncertainly wandered since the morning. I\r\nsaw a limitless gray plain, across whose width the wind seemed to be\r\ndriving faint and thin waves of dust, pierced in places by a more\r\npointed billow of smoke.\r\n\r\nWhere the sun and the clouds trail patches of black and of white, the\r\nimmense space sparkles dully from point to point where our batteries\r\nare firing, and I saw it one moment entirely spangled with short-lived\r\nflashes. Another minute, part of the field grew dark under a steamy and\r\nwhitish film, a sort of hurricane of snow.\r\n\r\nAfar, on the evil, endless, and half-ruined fields, caverned like\r\ncemeteries, we see the slender skeleton of a church, like a bit of torn\r\npaper; and from one margin of the picture to the other, dim rows of\r\nvertical marks, close together and underlined, like the straight\r\nstrokes of a written page--these are the roads and their trees.\r\nDelicate meandering lines streak the plain backward and forward and\r\nrule it in squares, and these windings are stippled with men.\r\n\r\nWe can make out some fragments of lines made up of these human points\r\nwho have emerged from the hollowed streaks and are moving on the plain\r\nin the horrible face of the flying firmament. It is difficult to\r\nbelieve that each of those tiny spots is a living thing with fragile\r\nand quivering flesh, infinitely unarmed in space, full of deep\r\nthoughts, full of far memories and crowded pictures. One is fascinated\r\nby this scattered dust of men as small as the stars in the sky.\r\n\r\nPoor unknowns, poor fellow-men, it is your turn to give battle. Another\r\ntime it will be ours. Perhaps to-morrow it will be ours to feel the\r\nheavens burst over our heads or the earth open under our feet, to be\r\nassailed by the prodigious plague of projectiles, to be swept away by\r\nthe blasts of a tornado a hundred thousand times stronger than the\r\ntornado.\r\n\r\nThey urge us into the rearward shelters. For our eyes the field of\r\ndeath vanishes. To our ears the thunder is deadened on the great anvil\r\nof the clouds. The sound of universal destruction is still. The squad\r\nsurrounds itself with the familiar noises of life, and sinks into the\r\nfondling littleness of the dug-outs.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1] Military slang for machine-gun--Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nUnder Fire\r\n\r\n\r\nRUDELY awakened in the dark, I open my eyes: "What? What\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"Your turn on guard--it\'s two o\'clock in the morning," says Corporal\r\nBertrand at the opening into the hole where I am prostrate on the\r\nfloor. I hear him without seeing him.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming," I growl, and shake myself, and yawn in the little\r\nsepulchral shelter. I stretch my arms, and my hands touch the soft and\r\ncold clay. Then I cleave the heavy odor that fills the dug-out and\r\ncrawl out in the middle of the dense gloom between the collapsed bodies\r\nof the sleepers. After several stumbles and entanglements among\r\naccouterments, knapsacks and limbs stretched out in all directions, I\r\nput my hand on my rifle and find myself upright in the open air, half\r\nawake and dubiously balanced, assailed by the black and bitter breeze.\r\n\r\nShivering, I follow the corporal; he plunges in between the dark\r\nembankments whose lower ends press strangely and closely on our march.\r\nHe stops; the place is here. I make out a heavy mass half-way up the\r\nghostly wall which comes loose and descends from it with a whinnying\r\nyawn, and I hoist myself into the niche which it had occupied.\r\n\r\nThe moon is hidden by mist, but a very weak and uncertain light\r\noverspreads the scene, and one\'s sight gropes its way. Then a wide\r\nstrip of darkness, hovering and gliding up aloft, puts it out. Even\r\nafter touching the breastwork and the loophole in front of my face I\r\ncan hardly make them out, and my inquiring hand discovers, among an\r\nordered deposit of things, a mass of grenade handles.\r\n\r\n"Keep your eye skinned, old chap," says Bertrand in a low voice. "Don\'t\r\nforget that our listening-post is in front there on the left. Allons,\r\nso long." His steps die away, followed by those of the sleepy sentry\r\nwhom I am relieving.\r\n\r\nRifle-shots crackle all round. Abruptly a bullet smacks the earth of\r\nthe wall against which I am leaning. I peer through the loophole. Our\r\nline runs along the top of the ravine, and the land slopes downward in\r\nfront of me, plunging into an abyss of darkness where one can see\r\nnothing. One\'s sight ends always by picking out the regular lines of\r\nthe stakes of our wire entanglements, planted on the shore of the waves\r\nof night, and here and there the circular funnel-like wounds of shells,\r\nlittle, larger, or enormous, and some of the nearest occupied by\r\nmysterious lumber. The wind blows in my face, and nothing else is\r\nstirring save the vast moisture that drain from it. It is cold enough\r\nto set one shivering in perpetual motion. I look upwards, this way and\r\nthat; everything is borne down by dreadful gloom. I might be derelict\r\nand alone in the middle of a world destroyed by a cataclysm.\r\n\r\nThere is a swift illumination up above--a rocket. The scene in which I\r\nam stranded is picked out in sketchy incipience around me. The crest of\r\nour trench stands forth, jagged and dishevelled, and I see, stuck to\r\nthe outer wall every five paces like upright caterpillars, the shadows\r\nof the watchers. Their rifles are revealed beside them by a few spots\r\nof light. The trench is shored with sandbags. It is widened everywhere,\r\nand in many places ripped up by landslides. The sandbags, piled up and\r\ndislodged, appear in the starlike light of the rocket like the great\r\ndismantled stones of ancient ruined buildings. I look through the\r\nloophole, and discern in the misty and pallid atmosphere expanded by\r\nthe meteor the rows of stakes and even the thin lines of barbed wire\r\nwhich cross and recross between the posts. To my seeing they are like\r\nstrokes of a pen scratched upon the pale and perforated ground. Lower\r\ndown, the ravine is filled with the motionless silence of the ocean of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI come down from my look-out and steer at a guess towards my neighbor\r\nin vigil, and come upon him with outstretched hand. "Is that you?" I\r\nsay to him in a subdued voice, though I don\'t know him.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replies, equally ignorant who I am, blind like myself. "It\'s\r\nquiet at this time," he adds "A bit since I thought they were going to\r\nattack, and they may have tried it on, on the right, where they chucked\r\nover a lot of bombs. There\'s been a barrage of 75\'s--vrrrran,\r\nvrrrran--Old man, I said to myself, \'Those 75\'s, p\'raps they\'ve good\r\nreason for firing. If they did come out, the Boches, they must have\r\nfound something.\' Tiens, listen, down there, the bullets buffing\r\nthemselves!"\r\n\r\nHe opens his flask and takes a draught, and his last words, still\r\nsubdued, smell of wine: "Ah, la, la! Talk about a filthy war! Don\'t you\r\nthink we should be a lot better at home!--Hullo! What\'s the matter with\r\nthe ass?" A rifle has rung out beside us, making a brief and sudden\r\nflash of phosphorescence. Others go off here and there along our line.\r\nRifle-shots are catching after dark.\r\n\r\nWe go to inquire of one of the shooters, guessing our way through the\r\nsolid blackness that has fallen again upon us like a roof. Stumbling,\r\nand thrown anon on each other, we reach the man and touch him--"Well,\r\nwhat\'s up?"\r\n\r\nHe thought he saw something moving, but there is nothing more. We\r\nreturn through the density, my unknown neighbor and I, unsteady, and\r\nlaboring along the narrow way of slippery mud, doubled up as if we each\r\ncarried a crushing burden. At one point of the horizon and then at\r\nanother all around, a gun sounds, and its heavy din blends with the\r\nvolleys of rifle-fire, redoubled one minute and dying out the next, and\r\nwith the clusters of grenade-reports, of deeper sound than the crack of\r\nLebel or Mauser, and nearly like the voice of the old classical rifles.\r\nThe wind has again increased; it is so strong that one must protect\r\nhimself against it in the darkness; masses of huge cloud are passing in\r\nfront of the moon.\r\n\r\nSo there we are, this man and I, jostling without knowing each other,\r\nrevealed and then hidden from each other in sudden jerks by the flashes\r\nof the guns, oppressed by the opacity, the center of a huge circle of\r\nfires that appear and disappear in the devilish landscape.\r\n\r\n"We\'re under a curse," says the man.\r\n\r\nWe separate, and go each to his own loophole, to weary our eyes upon\r\ninvisibility. Is some frightful and dismal storm about to break? But\r\nthat night it did not. At the end of my long wait, with the first\r\nstreaks of day, there was even a lull.\r\n\r\nAgain I saw, when the dawn came down on us like a stormy evening, the\r\nsteep banks of our crumbling trench as they came to life again under\r\nthe sooty scarf of the low-hanging clouds, a trench dismal and dirty,\r\ninfinitely dirty, humped with debris and filthiness. Under the livid\r\nsky the sandbags are taking the same hue, and their vaguely shining and\r\nrounded shapes are like the bowels and viscera of giants, nakedly\r\nexposed upon the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the trench-wall behind me, in a hollowed recess, there is a heap of\r\nhorizontal things like logs. Tree-trunks? No, they are corpses.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAs the call of birds goes up from the furrowed ground, as the shadowy\r\nfields are renewed, and the light breaks and adorns each blade of\r\ngrass, I look towards the ravine. Below the quickening field and its\r\nhigh surges of earth and burned hollows, beyond the bristling of\r\nstakes, there is still a lifeless lake of shadow, and in front of the\r\nopposite slope a wall of night still stands.\r\n\r\nThen I turn again and look upon these dead men whom the day is\r\ngradually exhuming, revealing their stained and stiffened forms. There\r\nare four of them. They are our comrades, Lamuse, Barque, Biquet, and\r\nlittle Eudore. They rot there quite near us, blocking one half of the\r\nwide, twisting, and muddy furrow that the living must still defend.\r\n\r\nThey have been laid there as well as may be, supporting and crushing\r\neach other. The topmost is wrapped in a tent-cloth. Handkerchiefs had\r\nbeen placed on the faces of the others; but in brushing against them in\r\nthe dark without seeing them, or even in the daytime without noticing\r\nthem, the handkerchiefs have fallen, and we are living face to face\r\nwith these dead, heaped up there like a wood-pile.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIt was four nights ago that they were all killed together. I remember\r\nthe night myself indistinctly--it is like a dream. We were on\r\npatrol--they, I, Mesnil Andre, and Corporal Bertrand; and our business\r\nwas to identify a new German listening-post marked by the artillery\r\nobservers. We left the trench towards midnight and crept down the slope\r\nin line, three or four paces from each other. Thus we descended far\r\ninto the ravine, and saw, lying before our eyes, the embankment of\r\ntheir International Trench. After we had verified that there was no\r\nlistening-post in this slice of the ground we climbed back, with\r\ninfinite care. Dimly I saw my neighbors to right and left, like sacks\r\nof shadow, crawling, slowly sliding, undulating and rocking in the mud\r\nand the murk, with the projecting needle in front of a rifle. Some\r\nbullets whistled above us, but they did not know we were there, they\r\nwere not looking for us. When we got within sight of the mound of our\r\nline, we took a breather for a moment; one of us let a sigh go, another\r\nspoke. Another turned round bodily, and the sheath of his bayonet rang\r\nout against a stone. Instantly a rocket shot redly up from the\r\nInternational Trench. We threw ourselves flat on the ground, closely,\r\ndesperately, and waited there motionless, with the terrible star\r\nhanging over us and flooding us with daylight, twenty-five or thirty\r\nyards from our trench. Then a machine-gun on the other side of the\r\nravine swept the zone where we were. Corporal Bertrand and I had had\r\nthe luck to find in front of us, just as the red rocket went up and\r\nbefore it burst into light, a shell-hole, where a broken trestle was\r\nsteeped in the mud. We flattened ourselves against the edge of the\r\nhole, buried ourselves in the mud as much as possible, and the poor\r\nskeleton of rotten wood concealed us. The jet of the machine-gun\r\ncrossed several times. We heard a piercing whistle in the middle of\r\neach report, the sharp and violent sound of bullets that went into the\r\nearth, and dull and soft blows as well, followed by groans, by a little\r\ncry, and suddenly by a sound like the heavy snoring of a sleeper, a\r\nsound which slowly ebbed. Bertrand and I waited, grazed by the\r\nhorizontal hail of bullets that traced a network of death an inch or so\r\nabove us and sometimes scraped our clothes, driving us still deeper\r\ninto the mud, nor dared we risk a movement which might have lifted a\r\nlittle some part of our bodies. The machine-gun at last held its peace\r\nin an enormous silence. A quarter of an hour later we two slid out of\r\nthe shell-hole, and crawling on our elbows we fell at last like bundles\r\ninto our listening-post. It was high time, too, for at that moment the\r\nmoon shone out. We were obliged to stay in the bottom of the trench\r\ntill morning, and then till evening, for the machine-gun swept the\r\napproaches without pause. We could not see the prostrate bodies through\r\nthe loop-holes of the post, by reason of the steepness of the\r\nground--except, just on the level of our field of vision, a lump which\r\nappeared to be the back of one of them. In the evening, a sap was dug\r\nto reach the place where they had fallen. The work could not be\r\nfinished in one night and was resumed by the pioneers the following\r\nnight, for, overwhelmed with fatigue, we could no longer keep from\r\nfalling asleep.\r\n\r\nAwaking from a leaden sleep, I saw the four corpses that the sappers\r\nhad reached from underneath, hooking and then hauling them into the sap\r\nwith ropes. Each of them had several adjoining wounds, bullet-holes an\r\ninch or so apart--the mitrailleuse had fired fast. The body of Mesnil\r\nAndre was not found, and his brother Joseph did some mad escapades in\r\nsearch of it. He went out quite alone into No Man\'s Land, where the\r\ncrossed fire of machine-guns swept it three ways at once and\r\nconstantly. In the morning, dragging himself along like a slug, he\r\nshowed over the bank a face black with mud and horribly wasted. They\r\npulled him in again, with his face scratched by barbed wire, his hands\r\nbleeding, with heavy clods of mud in the folds of his clothes, and\r\nstinking of death. Like an idiot be kept on saying, "He\'s nowhere." He\r\nburied himself in a corner with his rifle, which he set himself to\r\nclean without hearing what was said to him, and only repeating "He\'s\r\nnowhere."\r\n\r\nIt is four nights ago since that night, and as the dawn comes once\r\nagain to cleanse the earthly Gehenna, the bodies are becoming\r\ndefinitely distinct.\r\n\r\nBarque in his rigidity seems immoderately long, his arms lie closely to\r\nthe body, his chest has sunk, his belly is hollow as a basin. With his\r\nhead upraised by a lump of mud, he looks over his feet at those who\r\ncome up on the left; his face is dark and polluted by the clammy stains\r\nof disordered hair, and his wide and scalded eyes are heavily encrusted\r\nwith blackened blood. Eudore seems very small by contrast, and his\r\nlittle face is completely white, so white as to remind you of the\r\nbe-flowered face of a pierrot, and it is touching to see that little\r\ncircle of white paper among the gray and bluish tints of the corpses.\r\nThe Breton Biquet, squat and square as a flagstone, appears to be under\r\nthe stress of a huge effort; he might be trying to uplift the misty\r\ndarkness; and the extreme exertion overflows upon the protruding\r\ncheek-bones and forehead of his grimacing face, contorts it hideously,\r\nsets the dried and dusty hair bristling, divides his jaws in a spectral\r\ncry, and spreads wide the eyelids from his lightless troubled eyes, his\r\nflinty eyes; and his hands are contracted in a clutch upon empty air.\r\n\r\nBarque and Biquet were shot in the belly; Eudore in the throat. In the\r\ndragging and carrying they were further injured. Big Lamuse, at last\r\nbloodless, had a puffed and creased face, and the eyes were gradually\r\nsinking in their sockets, one more than the other. They have wrapped\r\nhim in a tent-cloth, and it shows a dark stain where the neck is. His\r\nright shoulder has been mangled by several bullets, and the arm is held\r\non only by strips of the sleeve and by threads that they have put in\r\nsince. The first night he was placed there, this arm hung outside the\r\nheap of dead, and the yellow hand, curled up on a lump of earth,\r\ntouched passers-by in the face; so they pinned the arm to the greatcoat.\r\n\r\nA pestilential vapor begins to hover about the remains of these beings\r\nwith whom we lived so intimately and suffered so long.\r\n\r\nWhen we see them we say, "They are dead, all four"; but they are too\r\nfar disfigured for us to say truly, "It is they," and one must turn\r\naway from the motionless monsters to feel the void they have left among\r\nus and the familiar things that have been wrenched away.\r\n\r\nMen of other companies or regiments, strangers who come this way by\r\nday--by night one leans unconsciously on everything within reach of the\r\nhand, dead or alive-give a start when faced by these corpses flattened\r\none on the other in the open trench. Sometimes they are angry--"What\r\nare they thinking about to leave those stiffs there?"--"It\'s shameful."\r\nThen they add, "It\'s true they can\'t be taken away from there." And\r\nthey were only buried in the night.\r\n\r\nMorning has come. Opposite us we see the other slope of the ravine,\r\nHill 119, an eminence scraped, stripped, and scratched, veined with\r\nshaken trenches and lined with parallel cuttings that vividly reveal\r\nthe clay and the chalky soil. Nothing is stirring there; and our shells\r\nthat burst in places with wide spouts of foam like huge billows seem to\r\ndeliver their resounding blows upon a great breakwater, ruined and\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nMy spell of vigil is finished, and the other sentinels, enveloped in\r\ndamp and trickling tent-cloths, with their stripes and plasters of mud\r\nand their livid jaws, disengage themselves from the soil wherein they\r\nare molded, bestir themselves, and come down. For us, it is rest until\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nWe yawn and stroll. We see a comrade pass and then another. Officers go\r\nto and fro, armed with periscopes and telescopes. We feel our feet\r\nagain, and begin once more to live. The customary remarks cross and\r\nclash; and were it not for the dilapidated outlook, the sunken lines of\r\nthe trench that buries us on the hillside, and the veto on our voices,\r\nwe might fancy ourselves in the rear lines. But lassitude weighs upon\r\nall of us, our faces are jaundiced and the eyelids reddened; through\r\nlong watching we look as if we had been weeping. For several days now\r\nwe have all of us been sagging and growing old.\r\n\r\nOne after another the men of my squad have made a confluence at a curve\r\nin the trench. They pile themselves where the soil is only chalky, and\r\nwhere, above the crust that bristles with severed roots, the\r\nexcavations have exposed some beds of white stones that had lain in the\r\ndarkness for over a hundred thousand years.\r\n\r\nThere in the widened fairway, Bertrand\'s squad beaches itself. It is\r\nmuch reduced this time, for beyond the losses of the other night, we no\r\nlonger have Poterloo, killed in a relief, nor Cadilhac, wounded in the\r\nleg by a splinter the same evening as Poterloo, nor Tirioir nor\r\nTulacque who have been sent back, the one for dysentery, and the other\r\nfor pneumonia, which is taking an ugly turn--as he says in the\r\npostcards which he sends us as a pastime from the base hospital where\r\nhe is vegetating.\r\n\r\nOnce more I see gathered and grouped, soiled by contact with the earth\r\nand dirty smoke, the familiar faces and poses of those who have not\r\nbeen separated since the beginning, chained and riveted together in\r\nfraternity. But there is less dissimilarity than at the beginning in\r\nthe appearance of the cave-men.\r\n\r\nPapa Blaire displays in his well-worn mouth a set of new teeth, so\r\nresplendent that one can see nothing in all his poor face except those\r\ngayly-dight jaws. The great event of these foreign teeth\'s\r\nestablishment, which he is taming by degrees and sometimes uses for\r\neating, has profoundly modified his character and his manners. He is\r\nrarely besmeared with grime, he is hardly slovenly. Now that he has\r\nbecome handsome he feels it necessary to become elegant. For the moment\r\nhe is dejected, because--a miracle--he cannot wash himself. Deeply sunk\r\nin a corner, he half opens a lack-luster eye, bites and masticates his\r\nold soldier\'s mustache--not long ago the only ornament on his face--and\r\nfrom time to time spits out a hair.\r\n\r\nFouillade is shivering, cold-smitten, or yawns, depressed and shabby.\r\nMarthereau has not changed at all. He is still as always well-bearded,\r\nhis eye round and blue, and his legs so short that his trousers seem to\r\nbe slipping continually from his waist and dropping to his feet. Cocon\r\nis always Cocon by the dried and parchment-like head wherein sums are\r\nworking; but a recurrence of lice, the ravages of which we see\r\noverflowing on to his neck and wrists, has isolated him for a week now\r\nin protracted tussles which leave him surly when he returns among us.\r\nParadis retains unimpaired the same quantum of good color and good\r\ntemper; he is unchanging, perennial. We smile when he appears in the\r\ndistance, placarded on the background of sandbags like a new poster.\r\nNothing has changed in Pepin either, whom we can just see taking a\r\nstroll--we can tell him behind by his red-and-white squares of an\r\noilcloth draught-board, and in front by his blade-like face and the\r\ngleam of a knife in his cold gray look. Nor has Volpatte changed, with\r\nhis leggings, his shouldered blanket, and his face of a Mongolian\r\ntatooed with dirt; nor Tirette, although he has been worried for some\r\ntime by blood-red streaks in his eyes--for some unknown and mysterious\r\nreason. Farfadet keeps himself aloof, in pensive expectation. When the\r\npost is being given out he awakes from his reverie to go so far, and\r\nthen retires into himself. His clerkly hands indite numerous and\r\ncareful postcards. He does not know of Eudoxie\'s end. Lamuse said no\r\nmore to any one of the ultimate and awful embrace in which he clasped\r\nher body. He regretted--I knew it--his whispered confidence to me that\r\nevening, and up to his death he kept the horrible affair sacred to\r\nhimself, with tenacious bashfulness. So we see Farfadet continuing to\r\nlive his airy existence with the living likeness of that fair hair,\r\nwhich he only leaves for the scarce monosyllables of his contact with\r\nus. Corporal Bertrand has still the same soldierly and serious mien\r\namong us; he is always ready with his tranquil smile to answer all\r\nquestions with lucid explanations, to help each of us to do his duty.\r\n\r\nWe are chatting as of yore, as not long since. But the necessity of\r\nspeaking in low tones distinguishes our remarks and imposes on them a\r\nlugubrious tranquillity.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nSomething unusual has happened. For the last three months the sojourn\r\nof each unit in the first-line trenches has been four days. Yet we have\r\nnow been five days here and there is no mention of relief. Some rumors\r\nof early attack are going about, brought by the liaison men and those\r\nof the fatigue-party that renews our rations every other night--without\r\nregularity or guarantee. Other portents are adding themselves to the\r\nwhispers of offensive--the stopping of leave, the failure of the post,\r\nthe obvious change in the officers, who are serious and closer to us.\r\nBut talk on this subject always ends with a shrug of the shoulders; the\r\nsoldier is never warned what is to be done with him; they put a bandage\r\non his eyes, and only remove it at the last minute. So, "We shall\r\nsee."--"We can only wait."\r\n\r\nWe detach ourselves from the tragic event foreboded. Is this because of\r\nthe impossibility of a complete understanding, or a despondent\r\nunwillingness to decipher those orders that are sealed letters to us,\r\nor a lively faith that one will pass through the peril once more?\r\nAlways, in spite of the premonitory signs and the prophecies that seem\r\nto be coming true, we fall back automatically upon the cares of the\r\nmoment and absorb ourselves in them--hunger, thirst, the lice whose\r\ncrushing ensanguines all our nails, the great weariness that saps us\r\nall.\r\n\r\n"Seen Joseph this morning?" says Volpatte. "He doesn\'t look very grand,\r\npoor lad."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll do something daft, certain sure. He\'s as good as a goner, that\r\nlad, mind you. First chance he has he\'ll jump in front of a bullet. I\r\ncan see he will."\r\n\r\n"It\'d give any one the pip for the rest of his natural. There were six\r\nbrothers of \'em, you know; four of \'em killed; two in Alsace, one in\r\nChampagne, one in Argonne. If Andre\'s killed he\'s the fifth."\r\n\r\n"If he\'d been killed they\'d have found his body--they\'d have seen it\r\nfrom the observation-post; you can\'t lose the rump and the thighs. My\r\nidea is that the night they went on patrol he went astray coming\r\nback--crawled right round, poor devil, and fell right into the Boche\r\nlines."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he got sewn up in their wire."\r\n\r\n"I tell you they\'d have found him if he\'d been done in; you know jolly\r\nwell the Boches wouldn\'t have brought the body in. And we looked\r\neverywhere. As long as he\'s not been found you can take it from me that\r\nhe\'s got away somewhere on his feet, wounded or unwounded."\r\n\r\nThis so logical theory finds favor, and now it is known that Mesnil\r\nAndre is a prisoner there is less interest in him. But his brother\r\ncontinues to be a pitiable object--"Poor old chap, he\'s so young!" And\r\nthe men of the squad look at him secretly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a twist!" says Cocon suddenly. The hour of dinner has gone\r\npast and we are demanding it. There appears to be only the remains of\r\nwhat was brought the night before.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the corporal thinking of to starve us? There he is--I\'ll go and\r\nget hold of him. Hey, corporal! Why can\'t you get us something to\r\neat?"--"Yes, yes--something to eat!" re-echoes the destiny of these\r\neternally hungry men.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming," says bustling Bertrand, who keeps going both day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"What then?" says Pepin, always hot-headed. "I don\'t feel like chewing\r\nmacaroni again; I shall open a tin of meat in less than two secs?" The\r\ndaily comedy of dinner steps to the front again in this drama.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t touch your reserve rations!" says Bertrand; "as soon as I\'m back\r\nfrom seeing the captain I\'ll get you something."\r\n\r\nWhen he returns he brings and distributes a salad of potatoes and\r\nonions, and as mastication proceeds our features relax and our eyes\r\nbecome composed.\r\n\r\nFor the ceremony of eating, Paradis has hoisted a policeman\'s hat. It\r\nis hardly the right place or time for it, but the hat is quite new, and\r\nthe tailor, who promised it for three months ago, only delivered it the\r\nday we came up. The pliant two-cornered hat of bright blue cloth on his\r\nflourishing round head gives him the look of a pasteboard gendarme with\r\nred-painted cheeks. Nevertheless, all the while he is eating, Paradis\r\nlooks at me steadily. I go up to him. "You\'ve a funny old face."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about it," he replies. "I want a chat with you. Come with\r\nme and see something."\r\n\r\nHis hand goes out to his half-full cup placed beside his dinner things;\r\nhe hesitates, and then decides to put his wine in a safe place down his\r\ngullet, and the cup in his pocket. He moves off and I follow him.\r\n\r\nIn passing he picks up his helmet that gapes on the earthen bench.\r\nAfter a dozen paces he comes close to me and says in a low voice and\r\nwith a queer air, without looking at me--as he does when he is\r\nupset--"I know where Mesnil Andre is. Would you like to see him? Come,\r\nthen."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he takes off his police hat, folds and pockets it. and puts\r\non his helmet. He sets off again and I follow him without a word.\r\n\r\nHe leads me fifty yards farther, towards the place where our common\r\ndug-out is, and the footbridge of sandbags under which one always\r\nslides with the impression that the muddy arch will collapse on one\'s\r\nback. After the footbridge, a hollow appears in the wall of the trench,\r\nwith a step made of a hurdle stuck fast in the clay. Paradis climbs\r\nthere, and motions to me to follow him on to the narrow and slippery\r\nplatform. There was recently a sentry\'s loophole here, and it has been\r\ndestroyed and made again lower down with a couple of bullet-screens.\r\nOne is obliged to stoop low lest his head rise above the contrivance.\r\n\r\nParadis says to me, still in the same low voice, "It\'s me that fixed up\r\nthose two shields, so as to see--for I\'d got an idea, and I wanted to\r\nsee. Put your eye to this--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anything; the hole\'s stopped up. What\'s that lump of\r\ncloth?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s him," says Paradis.\r\n\r\nAh! It was a corpse, a corpse sitting in a hole, and horribly near--\r\n\r\nHaving flattened my face against the steel plate and glued my eye to\r\nthe hole in the bullet-screen, I saw all of it. He was squatting, the\r\nhead hanging forward between the legs, both arms placed on his knees,\r\nhis hands hooked and half closed. He was easily identifiable--so near,\r\nso near!--in spite of his squinting and lightless eyes, by the mass of\r\nhis muddy beard and the distorted mouth that revealed the teeth. He\r\nlooked as if he were both smiling and grimacing at his rifle, stuck\r\nstraight up in the mud before him. His outstretched hands were quite\r\nblue above and scarlet underneath, crimsoned by a damp and hellish\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nIt was he, rain-washed and besmeared with a sort of scum, polluted and\r\ndreadfully pale, four days dead, and close up to our embankment into\r\nwhich the shell-hole where he had burrowed had bitten. We had not found\r\nhim because he was too near!\r\n\r\nBetween this derelict dead in its unnatural solitude and the men who\r\ninhabited the dug-out there was only a slender partition of earth, and\r\nI realize that the place in it where I lay my head corresponds to the\r\nspot buttressed by this dreadful body.\r\n\r\nI withdraw my face from the peep-hole and Paradis and I exchange\r\nglances. "Mustn\'t tell him yet," my companion whispers. "No, we\r\nmustn\'t, not at once--" "I spoke to the captain about rooting him out,\r\nand he said, too, \'we mustn\'t mention it now to the lad.\'" A light\r\nbreath of wind goes by. "I can smell it!"--"Rather!" The odor enters\r\nour thoughts and capsizes our very hearts.\r\n\r\n"So now," says Paradis, "Joseph\'s left alone, out of six brothers. And\r\nI\'ll tell you what--I don\'t think he\'ll stop long. The lad won\'t take\r\ncare of himself--he\'ll get himself done in. A lucky wound\'s got to drop\r\non him from the sky, otherwise he\'s corpsed. Six brothers--it\'s too\r\nbad, that! Don\'t you think it\'s too bad?" He added, "It\'s astonishing\r\nthat he was so near us."\r\n\r\n"His arm\'s just against the spot where I put my head."\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Paradis, "his right arm, where there\'s a wrist-watch."\r\n\r\nThe watch--I stop short--is it a fancy, a dream? It seems to me--yes, I\r\nam sure now--that three days ago, the night when we were so tired out,\r\nbefore I went to sleep I heard what sounded like the ticking of a watch\r\nand even wondered where it could come from.\r\n\r\n"It was very likely that watch you heard all the same, through the\r\nearth," says Paradis, whom I have told some of my thoughts; "they go on\r\nthinking and turning round even when the chap stops. Damn, your own\r\nticker doesn\'t know you--it just goes quietly on making little circles."\r\n\r\nI asked, "There\'s blood on his hands; but where was he hit?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know; in the belly, I think; I thought there was something dark\r\nunderneath him. Or perhaps in the face--did you notice the little stain\r\non the cheek?"\r\n\r\nI recall the hairy and greenish face of the dead man. "Yes, there was\r\nsomething on the cheek. Yes, perhaps it went in there--"\r\n\r\n"Look out!" says Paradis hurriedly, "there he is! We ought not to have\r\nstayed here."\r\n\r\nBut we stay all the same, irresolutely wavering, as Mesnil Joseph comes\r\nstraight up to us. Never did he seem so frail to us. We can see his\r\npallor afar off, his oppressed and unnatural expression; he is bowed as\r\nhe walks, and goes slowly, borne down by endless fatigue and his\r\nimmovable notion.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with your face?" he asks me--he has seen me point\r\nout to Paradis the possible entry of the bullet. I pretend not to\r\nunderstand and then make some kind of evasive reply. All at once I have\r\na torturing idea--the smell! It is there, and there is no mistaking it.\r\nIt reveals a corpse; and perhaps he will guess rightly.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that he has suddenly smelt the sign--the pathetic,\r\nlamentable appeal of the dead. But he says nothing, continues his\r\nsolitary walk, and disappears round the corner.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday," says Paradis to me, "he came just here, with his mess-tin\r\nfull of rice that he didn\'t want to eat. Just as if he knew what he was\r\ndoing, the fool stops here and talks of pitching the rest of his food\r\nover the bank, just on the spot where--where the other was. I couldn\'t\r\nstick that, old chap. I grabbed his arm just as he chucked the rice\r\ninto the air, and it flopped down here in the trench. Old man, he\r\nturned round on me in a rage and all red in the face, \'What the hell\'s\r\nup with you now?\' he says. I looked as fat-headed as I could, and\r\nmumbled some rot about not doing it on purpose. He shrugs his\r\nshoulders, and looks at me same as if I was dirt. He goes off, saying\r\nto himself, \'Did you see him, the blockhead?\' He\'s bad-tempered, you\r\nknow, the poor chap, and I couldn\'t complain. \'All right, all right,\'\r\nhe kept saying; and I didn\'t like it, you know, because I did wrong all\r\nthe time, although I was right."\r\n\r\nWe go back together in silence and re-enter the dugout where the others\r\nare gathered. It is an old headquarters post, and spacious. Just as we\r\nslide in, Paradis listens. "Our batteries have been playing extra hell\r\nfor the last hour, don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\nI know what he means, and reply with an empty gesture, "We shall see,\r\nold man, we shall see all right!"\r\n\r\nIn the dug-out, to an audience of three, Tirette is again pouring out\r\nhis barrack-life tales. Marthereau is snoring in a corner; he is close\r\nto the entry, and to get down we have to stride over his short legs,\r\nwhich seem to have gone back into his trunk. A group of kneeling men\r\naround a folded blanket are playing with cards--\r\n\r\n"My turn!"--"40, 42--48--49!--Good!"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he lucky, that game-bird; it\'s imposs\', I\'ve got stumped three\r\ntimes I want nothing more to do with you. You\'re skinning me this\r\nevening, and you robbed me the other day, too, you infernal\r\nfritter!"--"What did you revoke for, mugwump?"--"I\'d only the king,\r\nnothing else."\r\n\r\n"All the same," murmurs some one who is eating in a corner, "this\r\nCamembert, it cost twenty-five sous, but you talk about muck! Outside\r\nthere\'s a layer of sticky glue, and inside it\'s plaster that breaks."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tirette relates the outrages inflicted on him during his\r\ntwenty-one days of training owing to the quarrelsome temper of a\r\ncertain major: "A great hog he was, my boy, everything rotten on this\r\nearth. All the lot of us looked foul when he went by or when we saw him\r\nin the officers\' room spread out on a chair that you couldn\'t see\r\nunderneath him, with his vast belly and huge cap, and circled round\r\nwith stripes from top to bottom, like a barrel--he was hard on the\r\nprivate! They called him Loeb--a Boche, you see!"\r\n\r\n"I knew him!" cried Paradis; "when war started he was declared unfit\r\nfor active service, naturally. While I was doing my term he was a\r\ndodger already--but he dodged round all the street corners to pinch\r\nyou--you got a day\'s clink for an unbuttoned button, and he gave it you\r\nover and above if there was some bit of a thing about you that wasn\'t\r\nquite O.K.--and everybody laughed. He thought they were laughing at\r\nyou, and you knew they were laughing at him, but you knew it in vain,\r\nyou were in it up to your head for the clink."\r\n\r\n"He had a wife," Tirette goes on, "the old--"\r\n\r\n"I remember her, too," Paradis exclaimed. "You talk about a bitch!"\r\n\r\n"Some of \'em drag a little pug-dog about with \'em, but him, he trailed\r\nthat yellow minx about everywhere, with her broom-handle hips and her\r\nwicked look. It was her that worked the old sod up against us. He was\r\nmore stupid than wicked, but as soon as she was there he got more\r\nwicked than stupid. So you bet they were some nuisance--"\r\n\r\nJust then, Marthereau wakes up from his sleep by the entry with a\r\nhalf-groan. He straightens himself up, sitting on his straw like a\r\ngaol-bird, and we see his bearded silhouette take the vague outline of\r\na Chinese, while his round eye rolls and turns in the shadows. He is\r\nlooking at his dreams of a moment ago. Then he passes his hand over his\r\neyes and--as if it had some connection with his dream--recalls the\r\nscene that night when we came up to the trenches--"For all that," he\r\nsays, in a voice weighty with slumber and reflection, "there were some\r\nhalf-seas-over that night! Ah, what a night! All those troops,\r\ncompanies and whole regiments, yelling and surging all the way up the\r\nroad! In the thinnest of the dark you could see the jumble of poilus\r\nthat went on and up--like the sea itself, you\'d say--and carrying on\r\nacross all the convoys of artillery and ambulance wagons that we met\r\nthat night. I\'ve never seen so many, so many convoys in the night,\r\nnever!" Then he deals himself a thump on the chest, settles down again\r\nin self-possession, groans, and says no more.\r\n\r\nBlaire\'s voice rises, giving expression to the haunting thought that\r\nwakes in the depths of the men: "It\'s four o\'clock. It\'s too late for\r\nthere to be anything from our side."\r\n\r\nOne of the gamesters in the other corner yelps a question at another:\r\n"Now then? Are you going to play or aren\'t you, worm-face?"\r\n\r\nTirette continues the story of his major: "Behold one day they\'d served\r\nus at the barracks with some suetty soup. Old man, a disease, it was!\r\nSo a chap asks to speak to the captain, and holds his mess-tin up to\r\nhis nose."\r\n\r\n"Numskull!" some one shouts in the other corner. "Why didn\'t you trump,\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"\'Ah, damn it,\' said the captain, \'take it away from my nose, it\r\npositively stinks.\'"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t my game," quavers a discontented but unconvinced voice.\r\n\r\n"And the captain, he makes a report to the major. But behold the major,\r\nmad as the devil, he butts in shaking the paper in his paw: \'What\'s\r\nthis?\' he says. \'Where\'s the soup that has caused this rebellion, that\r\nI may taste it?\' They bring him some in a clean mess-tin and he sniffs\r\nit. \'What now!\' he says, \'it smells good. They damned well shan\'t have\r\nit then, rich soup like this!\'"\r\n\r\n"Not your game! And he was leading, too! Bungler! It\'s unlucky, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Then at five o\'clock as we were coming out of barracks, our two\r\nmarvels butt in again and plank themselves in front of the swaddies\r\ncoming out, trying to spot some little thing not quite so, and he said,\r\n\'Ah, my bucks, you thought you\'d score off me by complaining of this\r\nexcellent soup that I have consumed myself along with my partner here;\r\njust wait and see if I don\'t get even with you. Hey, you with the long\r\nhair, the tall artist, come here a minute!\' And all the time the beast\r\nwas jawing, his bag-o\'-bones--as straight and thin as a post--went\r\n\'oui, oui\' with her head."\r\n\r\n"That depends; if he hadn\'t a trump, it\'s another matter."\r\n\r\n"But all of a sudden we see her go white as a sheet, she puts her fist\r\non her tummy and she shakes like all that, and then suddenly, in front\r\nof all the fellows that filled the square, she drops her umbrella and\r\nstarts spewing!"\r\n\r\n"Hey, listen!" says Paradis, sharply, "they\'re shouting in the trench.\r\nDon\'t you hear? Isn\'t it \'alarm!\' they\'re shouting?"\r\n\r\n"Alarm? Are you mad?"\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly said when a shadow comes in through the low\r\ndoorway of our dug-out and cries--"Alarm, 22nd! Stand to arms!"\r\n\r\nA moment of silence and then several exclamations. "I knew it," murmurs\r\nParadis between his teeth, and he goes on his knees towards the opening\r\ninto the molehill that shelters us. Speech then ceases and we seem to\r\nbe struck dumb. Stooping or kneeling we bestir ourselves; we buckle on\r\nour waist-belts; shadowy arms dart from one side to another; pockets\r\nare rummaged. And we issue forth pell-mell, dragging our knapsacks\r\nbehind us by the straps, our blankets and pouches.\r\n\r\nOutside we are deafened. The roar of gunfire has increased a\r\nhundredfold, to left, to right, and in front of us. Our batteries give\r\nvoice without ceasing.\r\n\r\n"Do you think they\'re attacking?" ventures a man. "How should I know?"\r\nreplies another voice with irritated brevity.\r\n\r\nOur jaws are set and we swallow our thoughts, hurrying, bustling,\r\ncolliding, and grumbling without words.\r\n\r\nA command goes forth--"Shoulder your packs."--"There\'s a\r\ncounter-command--" shouts an officer who runs down the trench with\r\ngreat strides, working his elbows, and the rest of his sentence\r\ndisappears with him. A counter-command! A visible tremor has run\r\nthrough the files, a start which uplifts our heads and holds us all in\r\nextreme expectation.\r\n\r\nBut no; the counter-order only concerns the knapsacks. No pack; but the\r\nblanket rolled round the body, and the trenching-tool at the waist. We\r\nunbuckle our blankets, tear them open and roll them up. Still no word\r\nis spoken; each has a steadfast eye and the mouth forcefully shut. The\r\ncorporals and sergeants go here and there, feverishly spurring the\r\nsilent haste in which the men are bowed: "Now then, hurry up! Come,\r\ncome, what the hell are you doing? Will you hurry, yes or no?"\r\n\r\nA detachment of soldiers with a badge of crossed axes on their sleeves\r\nclear themselves a fairway and swiftly delve holes in the wall of the\r\ntrench. We watch them sideways as we don our equipment.\r\n\r\n"What are they doing, those chaps?"--"It\'s to climb up by."\r\n\r\nWe are ready. The men marshal themselves, still silently, their\r\nblankets crosswise, the helmet-strap on the chin, leaning on their\r\nrifles. I look at their pale, contracted, and reflective faces. They\r\nare not soldiers, they are men. They are not adventurers, or warriors,\r\nor made for human slaughter, neither butchers nor cattle. They are\r\nlaborers and artisans whom one recognizes in their uniforms. They are\r\ncivilians uprooted, and they are ready. They await the signal for death\r\nor murder; but you may see, looking at their faces between the vertical\r\ngleams of their bayonets, that they are simply men.\r\n\r\nEach one knows that he is going to take his head, his chest, his belly,\r\nhis whole body, and all naked, up to the rifles pointed forward, to the\r\nshells, to the bombs piled and ready, and above all to the methodical\r\nand almost infallible machine-guns--to all that is waiting for him\r\nyonder and is now so frightfully silent--before he reaches the other\r\nsoldiers that he must kill. They are not careless of their lives, like\r\nbrigands, nor blinded by passion like savages. In spite of the\r\ndoctrines with which they have been cultivated they are not inflamed.\r\nThey are above instinctive excesses. They are not drunk, either\r\nphysically or morally. It is in full consciousness, as in full health\r\nand full strength, that they are massed there to hurl themselves once\r\nmore into that sort of madman\'s part imposed on all men by the madness\r\nof the human race. One sees the thought and the fear and the farewell\r\nthat there is in their silence, their stillness, in the mask of\r\ntranquillity which unnaturally grips their faces. They are not the kind\r\nof hero one thinks of, but their sacrifice has greater worth than they\r\nwho have not seen them will ever be able to understand.\r\n\r\nThey are waiting; a waiting that extends and seems eternal. Now and\r\nthen one or another starts a little when a bullet, fired from the other\r\nside, skims the forward embankment that shields us and plunges into the\r\nflabby flesh of the rear wall.\r\n\r\nThe end of the day is spreading a sublime but melancholy light on that\r\nstrong unbroken mass of beings of whom some only will live to see the\r\nnight. It is raining--there is always rain in my memories of all the\r\ntragedies of the great war. The evening is making ready, along with a\r\nvague and chilling menace; it is about to set for men that snare that\r\nis as wide as the world.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nNew orders are peddled from mouth to mouth. Bombs strung on wire hoops\r\nare distributed--"Let each man take two bombs!"\r\n\r\nThe major goes by. He is restrained in his gestures, in undress,\r\ngirded, undecorated. We hear him say, "There\'s something good, mes\r\nenfants, the Boches are clearing out. You\'ll get along all right, eh?"\r\n\r\nNews passes among us like a breeze. "The Moroccans and the 21st Company\r\nare in front of us. The attack is launched on our right."\r\n\r\nThe corporals are summoned to the captain, and return with armsful of\r\nsteel things. Bertrand is fingering me; he hooks something on to a\r\nbutton of my greatcoat. It is a kitchen knife. "I\'m putting this on to\r\nyour coat," he says.\r\n\r\n"Me too!" says Pepin.\r\n\r\n"No," says Bertrand, "it\'s forbidden to take volunteers for these\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Be damned to you!" growls Pepin.\r\n\r\nWe wait, in the great rainy and shot-hammered space that has no other\r\nboundary than the distant and tremendous cannonade. Bertrand has\r\nfinished his distribution and returns. Several soldiers have sat down,\r\nand some of them are yawning.\r\n\r\nThe cyclist Billette slips through in front of us, carrying an\r\nofficer\'s waterproof on his arm and obviously averting his face.\r\n"Hullo, aren\'t you going too?" Cocon cries to him.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not going," says the other. "I\'m in the 17th. The Fifth\r\nBattalion\'s not attacking!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, they\'ve always got the luck, the Fifth. They\'ve never got to fight\r\nlike we have!" Billette is already in the distance, and a few grimaces\r\nfollow his disappearance.\r\n\r\nA man arrives running, and speaks to Bertrand, and then Bertrand turns\r\nto us--\r\n\r\n"Up you go," he says, "it\'s our turn."\r\n\r\nAll move at once. We put our feet on the steps made by the sappers,\r\nraise ourselves, elbow to elbow, beyond the shelter of the trench, and\r\nclimb on to the parapet.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nBertrand is out on the sloping ground. He covers us with a quick\r\nglance, and when we are all there he says, "Allons, forward!"\r\n\r\nOur voices have a curious resonance. The start has been made very\r\nquickly, unexpectedly almost, as in a dream. There is no whistling\r\nsound in the air. Among the vast uproar of the guns we discern very\r\nclearly this surprising silence of bullets around us--\r\n\r\nWe descend over the rough and slippery ground with involuntary\r\ngestures, helping ourselves sometimes with the rifle. Mechanically the\r\neye fastens on some detail of the declivity, of the ruined ground, on\r\nthe sparse and shattered stakes pricking up, at the wreckage in the\r\nholes. It is unbelievable that we are upright in full daylight on this\r\nslope where several survivors remember sliding along in the darkness\r\nwith such care, and where the others have only hazarded furtive glances\r\nthrough the loopholes. No, there is no firing against us. The wide\r\nexodus of the battalion out of the ground seems to have passed\r\nunnoticed! This truce is full of an increasing menace, increasing. The\r\npale light confuses us.\r\n\r\nOn all sides the slope is covered by men who, like us, are bent on the\r\ndescent. On the right the outline is defined of a company that is\r\nreaching the ravine by Trench 97--an old German work in ruins. We cross\r\nour wire by openings. Still no one fires on us. Some awkward ones who\r\nhave made false steps are getting up again. We form up on the farther\r\nside of the entanglements and then set ourselves to topple down the\r\nslope rather faster--there is an instinctive acceleration in the\r\nmovement. Several bullets arrive at last among us. Bertrand shouts to\r\nus to reserve our bombs and wait till the last moment.\r\n\r\nBut the sound of his voice is carried away. Abruptly, across all the\r\nwidth of the opposite slope, lurid flames burst forth that strike the\r\nair with terrible detonations. In line from left to right fires emerge\r\nfrom the sky and explosions from the ground. It is a frightful curtain\r\nwhich divides us from the world, which divides us from the past and\r\nfrom the future. We stop, fixed to the ground, stupefied by the sudden\r\nhost that thunders from every side; then a simultaneous effort uplifts\r\nour mass again and throws it swiftly forward. We stumble and impede\r\neach other in the great waves of smoke. With harsh crashes and\r\nwhirlwinds of pulverized earth, towards the profundity into which we\r\nhurl ourselves pell-mell, we see craters opened here and there, side by\r\nside, and merging in each other. Then one knows no longer where the\r\ndischarges fall. Volleys are let loose so monstrously resounding that\r\none feels himself annihilated by the mere sound of the downpoured\r\nthunder of these great constellations of destruction that form in the\r\nsky. One sees and one feels the fragments passing close to one\'s head\r\nwith their hiss of red-hot iron plunged in water. The blast of one\r\nexplosion so burns my hands that I let my rifle fall. I pick it up\r\nagain, reeling, and set off in the tawny-gleaming tempest with lowered\r\nhead, lashed by spirits of dust and soot in a crushing downpour like\r\nvolcanic lava. The stridor of the bursting shells hurts your ears,\r\nbeats you on the neck, goes through your temples, and you cannot endure\r\nit without a cry. The gusts of death drive us on, lift us up, rock us\r\nto and fro. We leap, and do not know whither we go. Our eyes are\r\nblinking and weeping and obscured. The view before us is blocked by a\r\nflashing avalanche that fills space.\r\n\r\nIt is the barrage fire. We have to go through that whirlwind of fire\r\nand those fearful showers that vertically fall. We are passing through.\r\nWe are through it, by chance. Here and there I have seen forms that\r\nspun round and were lifted up and laid down, illumined by a brief\r\nreflection from over yonder. I have glimpsed strange faces that uttered\r\nsome sort of cry--you could see them without hearing them in the roar\r\nof annihilation. A brasier full of red and black masses huge and\r\nfurious fell about me, excavating the ground, tearing it from under my\r\nfeet, throwing me aside like a bouncing toy. I remember that I strode\r\nover a smoldering corpse, quite black, with a tissue of rosy blood\r\nshriveling on him; and I remember, too, that the skirts of the\r\ngreatcoat flying next to me had caught fire, and left a trail of smoke\r\nbehind. On our right, all along Trench 97, our glances were drawn and\r\ndazzled by a rank of frightful flames, closely crowded against each\r\nother like men.\r\n\r\nForward!\r\n\r\nNow, we are nearly running. I see some who fall solidly flat, face\r\nforward, and others who founder meekly, as though they would sit down\r\non the ground. We step aside abruptly to avoid the prostrate dead,\r\nquiet and rigid, or else offensive, and also--more perilous\r\nsnares!--the wounded that hook on to you, struggling.\r\n\r\nThe International Trench! We are there. The wire entanglements have\r\nbeen torn up into long roots and creepers, thrown afar and coiled up,\r\nswept away and piled in great drifts by the guns. Between these big\r\nbushes of rain-damped steel the ground is open and free.\r\n\r\nThe trench is not defended. The Germans have abandoned it, or else a\r\nfirst wave has already passed over it. Its interior bristles with\r\nrifles placed against the bank. In the bottom are scattered corpses.\r\nFrom the jumbled litter of the long trench, hands emerge that protrude\r\nfrom gray sleeves with red facings, and booted legs. In places the\r\nembankment is destroyed and its woodwork splintered--all the flank of\r\nthe trench collapsed and fallen into an indescribable mixture. In other\r\nplaces, round pits are yawning. And of all that moment I have best\r\nretained the vision of a whimsical trench covered with many-colored\r\nrags and tatters. For the making of their sandbags the Germans had used\r\ncotton and woolen stuffs of motley design pillaged from some\r\nhouse-furnisher\'s shop; and all this hotch-potch of colored remnants,\r\nmangled and frayed, floats and flaps and dances in our faces.\r\n\r\nWe have spread out in the trench. The lieutenant, who has jumped to the\r\nother side, is stooping and summoning us with signs and shouts--"Don\'t\r\nstay there; forward, forward!"\r\n\r\nWe climb the wall of the trench with the help of the sacks, of weapons,\r\nand of the backs that are piled up there. In the bottom of the ravine\r\nthe soil is shot-churned, crowded with jetsam, swarming with prostrate\r\nbodies. Some are motionless as blocks of wood; others move slowly or\r\nconvulsively. The barrage fire continues to increase its infernal\r\ndischarge behind us on the ground that we have crossed. But where we\r\nare at the foot of the rise it is a dead point for the artillery.\r\n\r\nA short and uncertain calm follows. We are less deafened and look at\r\neach other. There is fever in the eyes, and the cheek-bones are\r\nblood-red. Our breathing snores and our hearts drum in our bodies.\r\n\r\nIn haste and confusion we recognize each other, as if we had met again\r\nface to face in a nightmare on the uttermost shores of death. Some\r\nhurried words are cast upon this glade in hell--"It\'s you! "--"Where\'s\r\nCocon?"--"Don\'t know."--"Have you seen the captain? "--"No."--"Going\r\nstrong?"--"Yes."\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the ravine is crossed and the other slope rises opposite.\r\nWe climb in Indian file by a stairway rough-hewn in the ground: "Look\r\nout!" The shout means that a soldier half-way up the steps has been\r\nstruck in the loins by a shell-fragment; he falls with his arms\r\nforward, bareheaded, like the diving swimmer. We can see the shapeless\r\nsilhouette of the mass as it plunges into the gulf. I can almost see\r\nthe detail of his blown hair over the black profile of his face.\r\n\r\nWe debouch upon the height. A great colorless emptiness is outspread\r\nbefore us. At first one can see nothing but a chalky and stony plain,\r\nyellow and gray to the limit of sight. No human wave is preceding ours;\r\nin front of us there is no living soul, but the ground is peopled with\r\ndead--recent corpses that still mimic agony or sleep, and old remains\r\nalready bleached and scattered to the wind, half assimilated by the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our pushing and jolted file emerges, two men close to me are\r\nhit, two shadows are hurled to the ground and roll under our feet, one\r\nwith a sharp cry, and the other silently, as a felled ox. Another\r\ndisappears with the caper of a lunatic, as if he had been snatched\r\naway. Instinctively we close up as we hustle forward--always\r\nforward--and the wound in our line closes of its own accord. The\r\nadjutant stops, raises his sword, lets it fall, and drops to his knees.\r\nHis kneeling body slopes backward in jerks, his helmet drops on his\r\nheels, and he remains there, bareheaded, face to the sky. Hurriedly the\r\nrush of the rank has split open to respect his immobility.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot see the lieutenant. No more leaders then--Hesitation\r\nchecks the wave of humanity that begins to beat on the plateau. Above\r\nthe trampling one hears the hoarse effort of our lungs. "Forward!"\r\ncries some soldier, and then all resume the onward race to perdition\r\nwith increasing speed.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Bertrand?" comes the laborious complaint of one of the\r\nforemost runners. "There! Here!" He had stooped in passing over a\r\nwounded man, but he leaves him quickly, and the man extends his arms\r\ntowards him and seems to sob.\r\n\r\nIt is just at the moment when he rejoins us that we hear in front of\r\nus, coming from a sort of ground swelling, the crackle of a\r\nmachine-gun. It is a moment of agony--more serious even than when we\r\nwere passing through the flaming earthquake of the barrage. That\r\nfamiliar voice speaks to us across the plain, sharp and horrible. But\r\nwe no longer stop. "Go on, go on!"\r\n\r\nOur panting becomes hoarse groaning, yet still we hurl ourselves toward\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\n"The Boches! I see them!" a man says suddenly. "Yes--their heads,\r\nthere--above the trench--it\'s there, the trench, that line. It\'s close,\r\nAh, the hogs!"\r\n\r\nWe can indeed make out little round gray caps which rise and then drop\r\non the ground level, fifty yards away, beyond a belt of dark earth,\r\nfurrowed and humped. Encouraged they spring forward, they who now form\r\nthe group where I am. So near the goal, so far unscathed, shall we not\r\nreach it? Yes, we will reach it! We make great strides and no longer\r\nhear anything. Each man plunges straight ahead, fascinated by the\r\nterrible trench, bent rigidly forward, almost incapable of turning his\r\nhead to right or to left. I have a notion that many of us missed their\r\nfooting and fell to the ground. I jump sideways to miss the suddenly\r\nerect bayonet of a toppling rifle. Quite close to me, Farfadet jostles\r\nme with his face bleeding, throws himself on Volpatte who is beside me\r\nand clings to him. Volpatte doubles up without slackening his rush and\r\ndrags him along some paces, then shakes him off without looking at him\r\nand without knowing who he is, and shouts at him in a breaking voice\r\nalmost choked with exertion: "Let me go, let me go, nom de Dieu!\r\nThey\'ll pick you up directly--don\'t worry."\r\n\r\nThe other man sinks to the ground, and his face, plastered with a\r\nscarlet mask and void of all expression, turns in every direction;\r\nwhile Volpatte, already in the distance, automatically repeats between\r\nhis teeth, "Don\'t worry," with a steady forward gaze on the line.\r\n\r\nA shower of bullets spirts around me, increasing the number of those\r\nwho suddenly halt, who collapse slowly, defiant and gesticulating, of\r\nthose who dive forward solidly with all the body\'s burden, of the\r\nshouts, deep, furious, and desperate, and even of that hollow and\r\nterrible gasp when a man\'s life goes bodily forth in a breath. And we\r\nwho are not yet stricken, we look ahead, we walk and we run, among the\r\nfrolics of the death that strikes at random into our flesh.\r\n\r\nThe wire entanglements--and there is one stretch of them intact. We go\r\nalong to where it has been gutted into a wide and deep opening. This is\r\na colossal funnel-hole, formed of smaller funnels placed together, a\r\nfantastic volcanic crater, scooped there by the guns.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this convulsion is stupefying; truly it seems that it must\r\nhave come from the center of the earth. Such a rending of virgin strata\r\nputs new edge on our attacking fury, and none of us can keep from\r\nshouting with a solemn shake of the head--even just now when words are\r\nbut painfully torn from our throats--"Ah, Christ! Look what hell we\'ve\r\ngiven \'em there! Ah, look!"\r\n\r\nDriven as if by the wind, we mount or descend at the will of the\r\nhollows and the earthy mounds in the gigantic fissure dug and blackened\r\nand burned by furious flames. The soil clings to the feet and we tear\r\nthem out angrily. The accouterments and stuffs that cover the soft\r\nsoil, the linen that is scattered about from sundered knapsacks,\r\nprevent us from sticking fast in it, and we are careful to plant our\r\nfeet in this debris when we jump into the holes or climb the hillocks.\r\n\r\nBehind us voices urge us--"Forward, boys, forward, nome de Dieu!"\r\n\r\n"All the regiment is behind us!" they cry. We do not turn round to see,\r\nbut the assurance electrifies our rush once more.\r\n\r\nNo more caps are visible behind the embankment of the trench we are\r\nnearing. Some German dead are crumbling in front of it, in pinnacled\r\nheaps or extended lines. We are there. The parapet takes definite and\r\nsinister shape and detail; the loopholes--we are prodigiously,\r\nincredibly close!\r\n\r\nSomething falls in front of us. It is a bomb. With a kick Corporal\r\nBertrand returns it so well that it rises and bursts just over the\r\ntrench.\r\n\r\nWith that fortunate deed the squad reaches the trench.\r\n\r\nPepin has hurled himself flat on the ground and is involved with a\r\ncorpse. He reaches the edge and plunges in--the first to enter.\r\nFouillade, with great gestures and shouts, jumps into the pit almost at\r\nthe same moment that Pepin rolls down it. Indistinctly I see--in the\r\ntime of the lightning\'s flash--a whole row of black demons stooping and\r\nsquatting for the descent, on the ridge of the embankment, on the edge\r\nof the dark ambush.\r\n\r\nA terrible volley bursts point-blank in our faces, flinging in front of\r\nus a sudden row of flames the whole length of the earthen verge. After\r\nthe stunning shock we shake ourselves and burst into devilish\r\nlaughter--the discharge has passed too high. And at once, with shouts\r\nand roars of salvation, we slide and roll and fall alive into the belly\r\nof the trench!\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWe are submerged in a mysterious smoke, and at first I can only see\r\nblue uniforms in the stifling gulf. We go one way and then another,\r\ndriven by each other, snarling and searching. We turn about, and with\r\nour hands encumbered by knife, bombs, and rifle, we do not know at\r\nfirst what to do.\r\n\r\n"They\'re in their funk-holes, the swine!" is the cry. Heavy explosions\r\nare shaking the earth--underground, in the dug-outs. We are all at once\r\ndivided by huge clouds of smoke so thick that we are masked and can see\r\nnothing more. We struggle like drowning men through the acrid darkness\r\nof a fallen fragment of night. One stumbles against barriers of\r\ncowering clustered beings who bleed and howl in the bottom. Hardly can\r\none make out the trench walls, straight up just here and made of white\r\nsandbags, which are everywhere torn like paper. At one time the heavy\r\nadhesive reek sways and lifts, and one sees again the swarming mob of\r\nthe attackers. Torn out of the dusty picture, the silhouette of a\r\nhand-to-hand struggle is drawn in fog on the wall, it droops and sinks\r\nto the bottom. I hear several shrill cries of "Kamarad!" proceeding\r\nfrom a pale-faced and gray-clad group in the huge corner made by a\r\nrending shell. Under the inky cloud the tempest of men flows back,\r\nclimbs towards the right, eddying, pitching and falling, along the dark\r\nand ruined mole.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly one feels that it is over. We see and hear and understand\r\nthat our wave, rolling here through the barrage fire, has not\r\nencountered an equal breaker. They have fallen back on our approach.\r\nThe battle has dissolved in front of us. The slender curtain of\r\ndefenders has crumbled into the holes, where they are caught like rats\r\nor killed. There is no more resistance, but a void, a great void. We\r\nadvance in crowds like a terrible array of spectators.\r\n\r\nAnd here the trench seems all lightning-struck. With its tumbled white\r\nwalls it might be just here the soft and slimy bed of a vanished river\r\nthat has left stony bluffs, with here and there the flat round hole of\r\na pool, also dried up; and on the edges, on the sloping banks and in\r\nthe bottom, there is a long trailing glacier of corpses--a dead river\r\nthat is filled again to overflowing by the new tide and the breaking\r\nwave of our company. In the smoke vomited by dug-outs and the shaking\r\nwind of subterranean explosions, I come upon a compact mass of men\r\nhooked onto each other who are describing a wide circle. Just as we\r\nreach them the entire mass breaks up to make a residue of furious\r\nbattle. I see Blaire break away, his helmet hanging on his neck by the\r\nchin-strap and his face flayed, and uttering a savage yell. I stumble\r\nupon a man who is crouching at the entry to a dug-out. Drawing back\r\nfrom the black hatchway, yawning and treacherous, he steadies himself\r\nwith his left hand on a beam. In his right hand and for several seconds\r\nhe holds a bomb which is on the point of exploding. It disappears in\r\nthe hole, bursts immediately, and a horrible human echo answers him\r\nfrom the bowels of the earth. The man seizes another bomb.\r\n\r\nAnother man strikes and shatters the posts at the mouth of another\r\ndug-out with a pickax he has found there, causing a landslide, and the\r\nentry is blocked. I see several shadows trampling and gesticulating\r\nover the tomb.\r\n\r\nOf the living ragged band that has got so far and has reached this\r\nlong-sought trench after dashing against the storm of invincible shells\r\nand bullets launched to meet them, I can hardly recognize those whom I\r\nknow, just as though all that had gone before of our lives had suddenly\r\nbecome very distant. There is some change working in them. A frenzied\r\nexcitement is driving them all out of themselves.\r\n\r\n"What are we stopping here for?" says one, grinding his teeth.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t we go on to the next?" a second asks me in fury. "Now we\'re\r\nhere, we\'d be there in a few jumps!\'\r\n\r\n"I, too, I want to go on."--"Me, too. Ah, the hogs!" They shake\r\nthemselves like banners. They carry the luck of their survival as it\r\nwere glory; they are implacable, uncontrolled, intoxicated with\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe wait and stamp about in the captured work, this strange demolished\r\nway that winds along the plain and goes from the unknown to the unknown.\r\n\r\nAdvance to the right!\r\n\r\nWe begin to flow again in one direction. No doubt it is a movement\r\nplanned up there, back yonder, by the chiefs. We trample soft bodies\r\nunderfoot, some of which are moving and slowly altering their position;\r\nrivulets and cries come from them. Like posts and heaps of rubbish,\r\ncorpses are piled anyhow on the wounded, and press them down, suffocate\r\nthem, strangle them. So that I can get by, I must push at a slaughtered\r\ntrunk of which the neck is a spring of gurgling blood.\r\n\r\nIn the cataclysm of earth and of massive wreckage blown up and blown\r\nout, above the hordes of wounded and dead that stir together, athwart\r\nthe moving forest of smoke implanted in the trench and in all its\r\nenvirons, one no longer sees any face but what is inflamed, blood-red\r\nwith sweat, eyes flashing. Some groups seem to be dancing as they\r\nbrandish their knives. They are elated, immensely confident, ferocious.\r\n\r\nThe battle dies down imperceptibly. A soldier says, "Well, what\'s to be\r\ndone now?" it flares up again suddenly at one point. Twenty yards away\r\nin the plain, in the direction of a circle that the gray embankment\r\nmakes, a cluster of rifle-shots crackles and hurls its scattered\r\nmissiles around a hidden machine-gun, that spits intermittently and\r\nseems to be in difficulties.\r\n\r\nUnder the shadowy wing of a sort of yellow and bluish nimbus I see men\r\nencircling the flashing machine and closing in on it. Near to me I make\r\nout the silhouette of Mesnil Joseph, who is steering straight and with\r\nno effort of concealment for the spot whence the barking explosions\r\ncome in jerky sequence.\r\n\r\nA flash shoots out from a corner of the trench between us two. Joseph\r\nhalts, sways, stoops, and drops on one knee. I run to him and he\r\nwatches me coming. "It\'s nothing--my thigh. I can crawl along by\r\nmyself." He seems to have become quiet, childish, docile; and sways\r\nslowly towards the trench.\r\n\r\nI have still in my eyes the exact spot whence rang the shot that hit\r\nhim, and I slip round there by the left, making a detour. No one there.\r\nI only meet another of our squad on the same errand--Paradis.\r\n\r\nWe are bustled by men who are carrying on their shoulders pieces of\r\niron of all shapes. They block up the trench and separate us. "The\r\nmachine-gun\'s taken by the 7th," they shout, "it won\'t bark any more.\r\nIt was a mad devil--filthy beast! Filthy beast!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s there to do now?"--"Nothing."\r\n\r\nWe stay there, jumbled together, and sit down. The living have ceased\r\nto gasp for breath, the dying have rattled their last, surrounded by\r\nsmoke and lights and the din of the guns that rolls to all the ends of\r\nthe earth. We no longer know where we are. There is neither earth nor\r\nsky--nothing but a sort of cloud. The first period of inaction is\r\nforming in the chaotic drama, and there is a general slackening in the\r\nmovement and the uproar. The cannonade grows less; it still shakes the\r\nsky as a cough shakes a man, but it is farther off now. Enthusiasm is\r\nallayed, and there remains only the infinite fatigue that rises and\r\noverwhelms us, and the infinite waiting that begins over again.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWhere is the enemy? He has left his dead everywhere, and we have seen\r\nrows of prisoners. Yonder again there is one, drab, ill-defined and\r\nsmoky, outlined against the dirty sky. But the bulk seem to have\r\ndispersed afar. A few shells come to us here and there blunderingly,\r\nand we ridicule them. We are saved, we are quiet, we are alone, in this\r\ndesert where an immensity of corpses adjoins a line of the living.\r\n\r\nNight has come. The dust has flown away, but has yielded place to\r\nshadow and darkness over the long-drawn multitude\'s disorder. Men\r\napproach each other, sit down, get up again and walk about, leaning on\r\neach other or hooked together. Between the dug-outs, which are blocked\r\nby the mingled dead, we gather in groups and squat. Some have laid\r\ntheir rifles on the ground and wander on the rim of the trench with\r\ntheir arms balancing; and when they come near we can see that they are\r\nblackened and scorched, their eyes are red and slashed with mud. We\r\nspeak seldom, but are beginning to think.\r\n\r\nWe see the stretcher-bearers, whose sharp silhouettes stoop and grope;\r\nthey advance linked two and two together by their long burdens. Yonder\r\non our right one hears the blows of pick and shovel.\r\n\r\nI wander into the middle of this gloomy turmoil. In a place where the\r\nbombardment has crushed the embankment of the trench into a gentle\r\nslope, some one is seated. A faint light still prevails. The tranquil\r\nattitude of this man as he looks reflectively in front of him is\r\nsculptural and striking. Stooping, I recognize him as Corporal\r\nBertrand. He turns his face towards me, and I feel that he is looking\r\nat me through the shadows with his thoughtful smile.\r\n\r\n"I was coming to look for you," he says; "they\'re organizing a guard\r\nfor the trench until we\'ve got news of what the others have done and\r\nwhat\'s going on in front. I\'m going to put you on double sentry with\r\nParadis, in a listening-post that the sappers have just dug."\r\n\r\nWe watch the shadows of the passers-by and of those who are seated,\r\noutlined in inky blots, bowed and bent in diverse attitudes under the\r\ngray sky, all along the ruined parapet. Dwarfed to the size of insects\r\nand worms, they make a strange and secret stirring among these\r\nshadow-hidden lands where for two years war has caused cities of\r\nsoldiers to wander or stagnate over deep and boundless cemeteries.\r\n\r\nTwo obscure forms pass in the dark, several paces from us; they are\r\ntalking together in low voices--"You bet, old chap, instead of\r\nlistening to him, I shoved my bayonet into his belly so that I couldn\'t\r\nhaul it out."\r\n\r\n"There were four in the bottom of the hole. I called to \'em to come\r\nout, and as soon as one came out I stuck him. Blood ran down me up to\r\nthe elbow and stuck up my sleeves."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" the first speaker went on, "when we are telling all about it\r\nlater, if we get back, to the other people at home, by the stove and\r\nthe candle, who\'s going to believe it? It\'s a pity, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a damn about that, as long as we do get back," said the\r\nother; "I want the end quickly, and only that."\r\n\r\nBertrand was used to speak very little ordinarily, and never of\r\nhimself. But he said, "I\'ve got three of them on my hands. I struck\r\nlike a madman. Ah, we were all like beasts when we got here!"\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice and there was a restrained tremor in it: "it was\r\nnecessary," he said, "it was necessary, for the future\'s sake."\r\n\r\nHe crossed his arms and tossed his head: "The future!" he cried all at\r\nonce as a prophet might. "How will they regard this slaughter, they\r\nwho\'ll live after us, to whom progress--which comes as sure as\r\nfate--will at last restore the poise of their conscience? How will they\r\nregard these exploits which even we who perform them don\'t know whether\r\none should compare them with those of Plutarch\'s and Corneille\'s heroes\r\nor with those of hooligans and apaches?\r\n\r\n"And for all that, mind you," Bertrand went on, "there is one figure\r\nthat has risen above the war and will blaze with the beauty and\r\nstrength of his courage--"\r\n\r\nI listened, leaning on a stick and towards him, drinking in the voice\r\nthat came in the twilight silence from the lips that so rarely spoke.\r\nHe cried with a clear voice--"Liebknecht!"\r\n\r\nHe stood up with his arms still crossed. His face, as profoundly\r\nserious as a statue\'s, drooped upon his chest. But he emerged once\r\nagain from his marble muteness to repeat, "The future, the future! The\r\nwork of the future will be to wipe out the present, to wipe it out more\r\nthan we can imagine, to wipe it out like something abominable and\r\nshameful. And yet--this present--it had to be, it had to be! Shame on\r\nmilitary glory, shame on armies, shame on the soldier\'s calling, that\r\nchanges men by turns into stupid victims or ignoble brutes. Yes, shame.\r\nThat\'s the true word, but it\'s too true; it\'s true in eternity, but\r\nit\'s not yet true for us. It will be true when there is a Bible that is\r\nentirely true, when it is found written among the other truths that a\r\npurified mind will at the same time let us understand. We are still\r\nlost, still exiled far from that time. In our time of to-day, in these\r\nmoments, this truth is hardly more than a fallacy, this sacred saying\r\nis only blasphemy!"\r\n\r\nA kind of laugh came from him, full of echoing dreams--"To think I once\r\ntold them I believed in prophecies, just to kid them!"\r\n\r\nI sat down by Bertrand\'s side. This soldier who had always done more\r\nthan was required of him and survived notwithstanding, stood at that\r\nmoment in my eyes for those who incarnate a lofty moral conception, who\r\nhave the strength to detach themselves from the hustle of\r\ncircumstances, and who are destined, however little their path may run\r\nthrough a splendor of events, to dominate their time.\r\n\r\n"I have always thought all those things," I murmured.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Bertrand. We looked at each other without a word, with a\r\nlittle surprised self-communion. After this full silence he spoke\r\nagain. "It\'s time to start duty; take your rifle and come."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nFrom our listening-post we see towards the east a light spreading like\r\na conflagration, but bluer and sadder than buildings on fire. It\r\nstreaks the sky above a long black cloud which extends suspended like\r\nthe smoke of an extinguished fire, like an immense stain on the world.\r\nIt is the returning morning.\r\n\r\nIt is so cold that we cannot stand still in spite of our fettering\r\nfatigue. We tremble and shiver and shed tears, and our teeth chatter.\r\nLittle by little, with dispiriting tardiness, day escapes from the sky\r\ninto the slender framework of the black clouds. All is frozen,\r\ncolorless and empty; a deathly silence reigns everywhere. There is rime\r\nand snow under a burden of mist. Everything is white. Paradis moves--a\r\nheavy pallid ghost, for we two also are all white. I had placed my\r\nshoulder-bag on the other side of the parapet, and it looks as if\r\nwrapped in paper. In the bottom of the hole a little snow floats,\r\nfretted and gray in the black foot-bath. Outside the hole, on the\r\npiled-up things, in the excavations, upon the crowded dead, snow rests\r\nlike muslin.\r\n\r\nTwo stooping protuberant masses are crayoned on the mist; they grow\r\ndarker as they approach and hail us. They are the men who come to\r\nrelieve us. Their faces are ruddy and tearful with cold, their\r\ncheek-bones like enameled tiles; but their greatcoats are not\r\nsnow-powdered, for they have slept underground.\r\n\r\nParadis hoists himself out. Over the plain I follow his Father\r\nChristmas back and the duck-like waddle of the boots that pick up\r\nwhite-felted soles. Bending deeply forward we regain the trench; the\r\nfootsteps of those who replaced us are marked in black on the scanty\r\nwhiteness that covers the ground.\r\n\r\nWatchers are standing at intervals in the trench, over which tarpaulins\r\nare stretched on posts here and there, figured in white velvet or\r\nmottled with rime, and forming great irregular tents; and between the\r\nwatchers are squatting forms who grumble and try to fight against the\r\ncold, to exclude it from the meager fireside of their own chests, or\r\nwho are simply frozen. A dead man has slid down, upright and hardly\r\naskew, with his feet in the trench and his chest and arms resting on\r\nthe bank. He was clasping the earth when life left him. His face is\r\nturned skyward and is covered with a leprosy of ice, the eyelids are\r\nwhite as the eyes, the mustache caked with hard slime. Other bodies are\r\nsleeping, less white than that one; the snowy stratum is only intact on\r\nlifeless things.\r\n\r\n"We must sleep." Paradis and I are looking for shelter, a hole where we\r\nmay hide ourselves and shut our eyes. "It can\'t be helped if there are\r\nstiffs in the dugouts," mutters Paradis; "in a cold like this they\'ll\r\nkeep, they won\'t be too bad." We go forward, so weary that we can only\r\nsee the ground.\r\n\r\nI am alone. Where is Paradis? He must have lain down in some hole, and\r\nperhaps I did not hear his call. I meet Marthereau. "I\'m looking where\r\nI can sleep, I\'ve been on guard," he says.\r\n\r\n"I, too; let\'s look together."\r\n\r\n"What\'s all the row and to-do?" says Marthereau. A mingled hubbub of\r\ntrampling and voices overflows from the communication trench that goes\r\noff here. "The communication trenches are full of men. Who are you?"\r\n\r\nOne of those with whom we are suddenly mixed up replies, "We\'re the\r\nFifth Battalion." The newcomers stop. They are in marching order. The\r\none that spoke sits down for a breathing space on the curves of a\r\nsand-bag that protrudes from the line. He wipes his nose with the back\r\nof his sleeve.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here? Have they told you to come?"\r\n\r\n"Not half they haven\'t told us. We\'re coming to attack. We\'re going\r\nyonder, right up." With his head he indicates the north. The curiosity\r\nwith which we look at them fastens on to a detail. "You\'ve carried\r\neverything with you?"--"We chose to keep it, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Forward!" they are ordered. They rise and proceed, incompletely awake,\r\ntheir eyes puffy, their wrinkles underlined. There are young men among\r\nthem with thin necks and vacuous eyes, and old men; and in the middle,\r\nordinary ones. They march with a commonplace and pacific step. What\r\nthey are going to do seems to us, who did it last night, beyond human\r\nstrength. But still they go away towards the north.\r\n\r\n"The revally of the damned," says Marthereau.\r\n\r\nWe make way for them with a sort of admiration and a sort of terror.\r\nWhen they have passed, Marthereau wags his head and murmurs, "There are\r\nsome getting ready, too, on the other side, with their gray uniforms.\r\nDo you think those chaps are feeling it about the attack? Then why have\r\nthey come? It\'s not their doing, I know, but it\'s theirs all the same,\r\nseeing they\'re here.--I know, I know, but it\'s odd, all of it."\r\n\r\nThe sight of a passer-by alters the course of his ideas: "Tiens,\r\nthere\'s Truc, the big one, d\'you know him? Isn\'t he immense and\r\npointed, that chap! As for me, I know I\'m not quite hardly big enough;\r\nbut him, he goes too far. He always knows what\'s going on, that\r\ntwo-yarder! For savvying everything, there\'s nobody going to give him\r\nthe go-by! I\'ll go and chivvy him about a funk-hole."\r\n\r\n"If there\'s a rabbit-hole anywhere?" replies the elongated passer-by,\r\nleaning on Marthereau like a poplar tree, "for sure, my old Caparthe,\r\ncertainly. Tiens, there"--and unbending his elbow he makes an\r\nindicative gesture like a flag-signaler--"\'Villa von Hindenburg.\' and\r\nthere, \'Villa Glucks auf.\' If that doesn\'t satisfy you, you gentlemen\r\nare hard to please. P\'raps there\'s a few lodgers in the basement, but\r\nnot noisy lodgers, and you can talk out aloud in front of them, you\r\nknow!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, nom de Dieu!" cried Marthereau a quarter of an hour after we had\r\nestablished ourselves in one of these square-cut graves, "there\'s\r\nlodgers he didn\'t tell us about, that frightful great lightning-rod,\r\nthat infinity!" His eyelids were just closing, but they opened again\r\nand he scratched his arms and thighs: "I want a snooze! It appears it\'s\r\nout of the question. Can\'t resist these things."\r\n\r\nWe settled ourselves to yawning and sighing, and finally we lighted a\r\nstump of candle, wet enough to resist us although covered with our\r\nhands; and we watched each other yawn.\r\n\r\nThe German dug-out consisted of several rooms. We were against a\r\npartition of ill-fitting planks; and on the other side, in Cave No. 2,\r\nsome men were also awake. We saw light trickle through the crannies\r\nbetween the planks and heard rumbling voices. "It\'s the other section,"\r\nsaid Marthereau.\r\n\r\nThen we listened, mechanically. "When I was off on leave," boomed an\r\ninvisible talker, "we had the hump at first, because we were thinking\r\nof my poor brother who was missing in March--dead, no doubt--and of my\r\npoor little Julien, of Class 1915, killed in the October attacks. And\r\nthen bit by bit, her and me, we settled down to be happy at being\r\ntogether again, you see. Our little kid, the last, a five-year-old,\r\nentertained us a treat. He wanted to play soldiers with me, and I made\r\na little gun for him. I explained the trenches to him; and he, all\r\nfluttering with delight like a bird, he was shooting at me and yelling.\r\nAh, the damned young gentleman, he did it properly! He\'ll make a famous\r\npoilu later! I tell you, he\'s quite got the military spirit!"\r\n\r\nA silence; then an obscure murmur of talk, in the midst of which we\r\ncatch the name of Napoleon; then another voice, or the same, saying,\r\n"Wilhelm, he\'s a stinking beast to have brought this war on. But\r\nNapoleon, he was a great man!"\r\n\r\nMarthereau is kneeling in front of me in the feeble and scanty rays of\r\nour candle, in the bottom of this dark ill-enclosed hole where the cold\r\nshudders through at intervals, where vermin swarm and where the sorry\r\ncrowd of living men endures the faint but musty savor of a tomb; and\r\nMarthereau looks at me. He still hears, as I do, the unknown soldier\r\nwho said, "Wilhelm is a stinking beast, but Napoleon was a great man,"\r\nand who extolled the martial ardor of the little boy still left to him.\r\nMarthereau droops his arms and wags his weary head--and the shadow of\r\nthe double gesture is thrown on the partition by the lean light in a\r\nsudden caricature.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" says my humble companion, "we\'re all of us not bad sorts, and\r\nwe\'re unlucky, and we\'re poor devils as well. But we\'re too stupid,\r\nwe\'re too stupid!"\r\n\r\nAgain he turns his eyes on me. In his bewhiskered and poodle-like face\r\nI see his fine eyes shining in wondering and still confused\r\ncontemplation of things which he is setting himself to understand in\r\nthe innocence of his obscurity.\r\n\r\nWe come out of the uninhabitable shelter; the weather has bettered a\r\nlittle; the snow has melted, and all is soiled anew. "The wind\'s licked\r\nup the sugar," says Marthereau.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nI am deputed to accompany Mesnil Joseph to the refuge on the Pylones\r\nroad. Sergeant Henriot gives me charge of the wounded man and hands me\r\nhis clearing order. "If you meet Bertrand on the way," says Henriot,\r\n"tell him to look sharp and get busy, will you?" Bertrand went away on\r\nliaison duty last night and they have been waiting for him for an hour;\r\nthe captain is getting impatient and threatens to lose his temper.\r\n\r\nI get under way with Joseph, who walks very slowly, a little paler than\r\nusual, and still taciturn. Now and again he halts, and his face\r\ntwitches. We follow the communication trenches, and a comrade appears\r\nsuddenly. It is Volpatte, and he says, "I\'m going with you to the foot\r\nof the hill." As he is off duty, he is wielding a magnificent twisted\r\nwalking-stick, and he shakes in his hand like castanets the precious\r\npair of scissors that never leaves him.\r\n\r\nAll three of us come out of the communication trench when the slope of\r\nthe land allows us to do it without danger of bullets--the guns are not\r\nfiring. As soon as we are outside we stumble upon a gathering of men.\r\nIt is raining. Between the heavy legs planted there like little trees\r\non the gray plain in the mist we see a dead man. Volpatte edges his way\r\nin to the horizontal form upon which these upright ones are waiting;\r\nthen he turns round violently and shouts to us, "It\'s Pepin!"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" says Joseph, who is already almost fainting. He leans on me and\r\nwe draw near. Pepin is full length, his feet and hands bent and\r\nshriveled, and his rain-washed face is swollen and horribly gray.\r\n\r\nA man who holds a pickax and whose sweating face is full of little\r\nblack trenches, recounts to us the death of Pepin: "He\'d gone into a\r\nfunk-hole where the Boches had planked themselves, and behold no one\r\nknew he was there and they smoked the hole to make sure of cleaning it\r\nout, and the poor lad, they found him after the operation, corpsed, and\r\nall pulled out like a cat\'s innards in the middle of the Boche cold\r\nmeat that he\'d stuck--and very nicely stuck too, I may say, seeing I\r\nwas in business as a butcher in the suburbs of Paris."\r\n\r\n"One less to the squad!" says Volpatte as we go away.\r\n\r\nWe are now on the edge of the ravine at the spot where the plateau\r\nbegins that our desperate charge traversed last evening, and we cannot\r\nrecognize it. This plain, which had then seemed to me quite level,\r\nthough it really slopes, is an amazing charnel-house. It swarms with\r\ncorpses, and might be a cemetery of which the top has been taken away.\r\n\r\nGroups of men are moving about it, identifying the dead of last evening\r\nand last night, turning the remains over, recognizing them by some\r\ndetail in spite of their faces. One of these searchers, kneeling, draws\r\nfrom a dead hand an effaced and mangled photograph--a portrait killed.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, black shell-smoke goes up in scrolls, then detonates\r\nover the horizon. The wide and stippled flight of an army of crows\r\nsweeps the sky.\r\n\r\nDown below among the motionless multitude, and identifiable by their\r\nwasting and disfigurement, there are zouaves, tirailleurs, and Foreign\r\nLegionaries from the May attack. The extreme end of our lines was then\r\non Berthonval Wood, five or six kilometers from here. In that attack,\r\nwhich was one of the most terrible of the war or of any war, those men\r\ngot here in a single rush. They thus formed a point too far advanced in\r\nthe wave of attack, and were caught on the flanks between the\r\nmachine-guns posted to right and to left on the lines they had\r\novershot. It is some months now since death hollowed their eyes and\r\nconsumed their cheeks, but even in those storm-scattered and dissolving\r\nremains one can identify the havoc of the machine-guns that destroyed\r\nthem, piercing their backs and loins and severing them in the middle.\r\nBy the side of heads black and waxen as Egyptian mummies, clotted with\r\ngrubs and the wreckage of insects, where white teeth still gleam in\r\nsome cavities, by the side of poor darkening stumps that abound like a\r\nfield of old roots laid bare, one discovers naked yellow skulls wearing\r\nthe red cloth fez, whose gray cover has crumbled like paper. Some\r\nthigh-bones protrude from the heaps of rags stuck together with reddish\r\nmud; and from the holes filled with clothes shredded and daubed with a\r\nsort of tar, a spinal fragment emerges. Some ribs are scattered on the\r\nsoil like old cages broken; and close by, blackened leathers are\r\nafloat, with water-bottles and drinking-cups pierced and flattened.\r\nAbout a cloven knapsack, on the top of some bones and a cluster of bits\r\nof cloth and accouterments, some white points are evenly scattered; by\r\nstooping one can see that they are the finger and toe constructions of\r\nwhat was once a corpse.\r\n\r\nSometimes only a rag emerges from long mounds to indicate that some\r\nhuman being was there destroyed, for all these unburied dead end by\r\nentering the soil.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, who were here yesterday, abandoned their soldiers by the\r\nside of ours without interring them--as witness these three putrefied\r\ncorpses on the top of each other, in each other, with their round gray\r\ncaps whose red edge is hidden with a gray band, their yellow-gray\r\njackets, and their green faces. I look for the features of one of them.\r\nFrom the depth of his neck up to the tufts of hair that stick to the\r\nbrim of his cap is just an earthy mass, the face become an anthill, and\r\ntwo rotten berries in place of the eyes. Another is a dried emptiness\r\nflat on its belly, the back in tatters that almost flutter, the hands,\r\nfeet, and face enrooted in the soil.\r\n\r\n"Look! It\'s a new one, this--"\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the plateau and in the depth of the rainy and bitter\r\nair, on the ghastly morrow of this debauch of slaughter, there is a\r\nhead planted in the ground, a wet and bloodless head, with a heavy\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nIt is one of ours, and the helmet is beside it. The distended eyelids\r\npermit a little to be seen of the dull porcelain of his eyes, and one\r\nlip shines like a slug in the shapeless beard. No doubt he fell into a\r\nshell-hole, which was filled up by another shell, burying him up to the\r\nneck like the cat\'s-head German of the Red Tavern at Souchez.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know him," says Joseph, who has come up very slowly and speaks\r\nwith difficulty.\r\n\r\n"I recognize him," replies Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"That bearded man?" says Joseph.\r\n\r\n"He has no beard. Look--" Stooping, Volpatte passes the end of his\r\nstick under the chin of the corpse and breaks off a sort of slab of mud\r\nin which the head was set, a slab that looked like a beard. Then he\r\npicks up the dead man\'s helmet and puts it on his head, and for a\r\nmoment holds before the eyes the round handles of his famous scissors\r\nso as to imitate spectacles.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" we all cried together, "it\'s Cocon!"\r\n\r\nWhen you hear of or see the death of one of those who fought by your\r\nside and lived exactly the same life, you receive a direct blow in the\r\nflesh before even understanding. It is truly as if one heard of his own\r\ndestruction. It is only later that one begins to mourn.\r\n\r\nWe look at the hideous head that is murder\'s jest, the murdered head\r\nalready and cruelly effacing our memories of Cocon. Another comrade\r\nless. We remain there around him, afraid.\r\n\r\n"He was--"\r\n\r\nWe should like to speak a little, but do not know what to say that\r\nwould be sufficiently serious or telling or true.\r\n\r\n"Come," says Joseph, with an effort, wholly engrossed by his severe\r\nsuffering, "I haven\'t strength enough to be stopping all the time."\r\n\r\nWe leave poor Cocon, the ex-statistician, with a last look, a look too\r\nshort and almost vacant.\r\n\r\n"One cannot imagine--" says Volpatte.\r\n\r\nNo, one cannot imagine. All these disappearances at once surpass the\r\nimagination. There are not enough survivors now. But we have vague idea\r\nof the grandeur of these dead. They have given all; by degrees they\r\nhave given all their strength, and finally they have given themselves,\r\nen bloc. They have outpaced life, and their effort has something of\r\nsuperhuman perfection.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"Tiens, he\'s just been wounded, that one, and yet--" A fresh wound is\r\nmoistening the neck of a body that is almost a skeleton.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a rat," says Volpatte. "The stiffs are old ones, but the rats\r\ntalk to \'em. You see some rats laid out--poisoned, p\'raps--near every\r\nbody or under it. Tiens, this poor old chap shall show us his." He\r\nlifts up the foot of the collapsed remains and reveals two dead rats.\r\n\r\n"I should like to find Farfadet again," says Volpatte. "I told him to\r\nwait just when we started running and he clipped hold of me. Poor lad,\r\nlet\'s hope he waited!"\r\n\r\nSo he goes to and fro, attracted towards the dead by a strange\r\ncuriosity; and these, indifferent, bandy him about from one to another,\r\nand at each step he looks on the ground. Suddenly he utters a cry of\r\ndistress. With his hand he beckons us as he kneels to a dead man.\r\n\r\nBertrand!\r\n\r\nAcute emotion grips us. He has been killed; he, too, like the rest, he\r\nwho most towered over us by his energy and intelligence. By virtue of\r\nalways doing his duty, he has at last got killed. He has at last found\r\ndeath where indeed it was.\r\n\r\nWe look at him, and then turn away from the sight and look upon each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe shock of his loss is aggravated by the spectacle that his remains\r\npresent, for they are abominable to see. Death has bestowed a grotesque\r\nlook and attitude on the man who was so comely and so tranquil. With\r\nhis hair scattered over his eyes, his mustache trailing in his mouth,\r\nand his face swollen--he is laughing. One eye is widely open, the other\r\nshut, and the tongue lolls out. His arms are outstretched in the form\r\nof a cross: the hands open, the fingers separated. The right leg is\r\nstraight. The left, whence flowed the hemorrhage that made him die, has\r\nbeen broken by a shell; it is twisted into a circle, dislocated, slack,\r\ninvertebrate. A mournful irony has invested the last writhe of his\r\nagony with the appearance of a clown\'s antic.\r\n\r\nWe arrange him, and lay him straight, and tranquillize the horrible\r\nmasks. Volpatte has taken a pocket-book from him and places it\r\nreverently among his own papers, by the side of the portrait of his own\r\nwife and children. That done, he shakes his head: "He--he was truly a\r\ngood sort, old man. When he said anything, that was the proof that it\r\nwas true. Ah, we needed him badly!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, "we had need of him always."\r\n\r\n"Ah, la, la!" murmurs Volpatte, and he trembles. Joseph repeats in a\r\nweak voice, "Ah, nom de Dieu! Ah, nom de Dieu!"\r\n\r\nThe plateau is as covered with people as a public square;\r\nfatigue-parties in detachments, and isolated men. Here and there, the\r\nstretcher-bearers are beginning (patiently and in a small way) their\r\nhuge and endless task.\r\n\r\nVolpatte leaves us, to return to the trench and announce our new\r\nlosses, and above all the great gap left by Bertrand. He says to\r\nJoseph, "We shan\'t lose sight of you, eh? Write us a line now and\r\nagain--just, \'All goes well; signed, Camembert,\' eh?" He disappears\r\namong the people who cross each other\'s path in the expanse now\r\ncompletely possessed by a mournful and endless rain.\r\n\r\nJoseph leans on me and we go down into the ravine. The slope by which\r\nwe descend is known as the Zouaves\' Cells. In the May attack, the\r\nZouaves had all begun to dig themselves individual shelters, and round\r\nthese they were exterminated. Some are still seen, prone on the brim of\r\nan incipient hole, with their trenching-tools in their fleshless hands\r\nor looking at them with the cavernous hollows where shrivel the\r\nentrails of eyes. The ground is so full of dead that the earth-falls\r\nuncover places that bristle with feet, with half-clothed skeletons, and\r\nwith ossuaries of skulls placed side by side on the steep slope like\r\nporcelain globe-jars.\r\n\r\nIn the ground here there are several strata of dead and in many places\r\nthe delving of the shells has brought out the oldest and set them out\r\nin display on the top of the new ones. The bottom of the ravine is\r\ncompletely carpeted with debris of weapons, clothing, and implements.\r\nOne tramples shell fragments, old iron, loaves and even biscuits that\r\nhave fallen from knapsacks and are not yet dissolved by the rain.\r\nMess-tins, pots of jam, and helmets are pierced and riddled by\r\nbullets--the scrapings and scum of a hell-broth; and the dislocated\r\nposts that survive are stippled with holes.\r\n\r\nThe trenches that run in this valley have a look of earthquake\r\ncrevasses, and as if whole tombs of uncouth things had been emptied on\r\nthe ruins of the earth\'s convulsion. And there, where no dead are, the\r\nvery earth is cadaverous.\r\n\r\nWe follow the International Trench, still fluttering with rainbow\r\nrags--a shapeless trench which the confusion of torn stuffs invests\r\nwith an air of a trench assassinated--to a place where the irregular\r\nand winding ditch forms an elbow. All the way along, as far as an\r\nearthwork barricade that blocks the way, German corpses are entangled\r\nand knotted as in a torrent of the damned, some of them emerging from\r\nmuddy caves in the middle of a bewildering conglomerate of beams,\r\nropes, creepers of iron, trench-rollers, hurdles, and bullet-screens.\r\nAt the barrier itself, one corpse stands upright, fixed in the other\r\ndead, while another, planted in the same spot, stands obliquely in the\r\ndismal place, the whole arrangement looking like part of a big wheel\r\nembedded in the mud, or the shattered sail of a windmill. And over all\r\nthis, this catastrophe of flesh and filthiness, religious images are\r\nbroadcast, post-cards, pious pamphlets, leaflets on which prayers are\r\nwritten in Gothic lettering--they have scattered themselves in waves\r\nfrom gutted clothing. The paper words seem to bedeck with blossom these\r\nshores of pestilence, this Valley of Death, with their countless\r\npallors of barren lies.\r\n\r\nI seek a solid footway to guide Joseph in--his wound is paralyzing him\r\nby degrees, and he feels it extending throughout his body. While I\r\nsupport him, and he is looking at nothing, I look upon the ghastly\r\nupheaval through which we are escaping.\r\n\r\nA German sergeant is seated, here where we tread, supported by the\r\nriven timbers that once formed the shelter of a sentry. There is a\r\nlittle hole under his eye; the thrust of a bayonet has nailed him to\r\nthe planks through his face. In front of him, also sitting, with his\r\nelbows on his knees and his fists on his chin, there is a man who has\r\nall the top of his skull taken off like a boiled egg. Beside them--an\r\nawful watchman!--the half of a man is standing, a man sliced in two\r\nfrom scalp to stomach, upright against the earthen wall. I do not know\r\nwhere the other half of this human post may be, whose eye hangs down\r\nabove and whose bluish viscera curl spirally round his leg.\r\n\r\nDown below, one\'s foot detaches itself from a matrix of blood,\r\nstiffened with French bayonets that have been bent, doubled, and\r\ntwisted by the force of the blow. Through a gap in the mutilated wall\r\none espies a recess where the bodies of soldiers of the Prussian Guard\r\nseem to kneel in the pose of suppliants, run through from behind, with\r\nblood-stained gaps, impaled. Out of this group they have pulled to its\r\nedge a huge Senegalese tirailleur, who, petrified in the contorted\r\nposition where death seized him, leans upon empty air and holds fast by\r\nhis feet, staring at his two severed wrists. No doubt a bomb had\r\nexploded in his hands; and since all his face is alive, he seems to be\r\ngnawing maggots.\r\n\r\n"It was here," says a passing soldier of an Alpine regiment, "that they\r\ndid the white flag trick; and as they\'d got Africans to deal with, you\r\nbet they got it hot!--Tiens, there\'s the white flag itself that these\r\ndunghills used."\r\n\r\nHe seizes and shakes a long handle that lies there. A square of white\r\nstuff is nailed to it, and unfolds itself innocently.\r\n\r\nA procession of shovel-bearers advances along the battered trench. They\r\nhave an order to shovel the earth into the relics of the trenches, to\r\nstop everything up, so that the bodies may be buried on the spot. Thus\r\nthese helmeted warriors will here perform the work of the redresser of\r\nwrongs as they restore their full shape to the fields and make level\r\nthe cavities already half filled by cargoes of invaders.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nSome one calls me from the other side of the trench, a man sitting on\r\nthe ground and leaning against a stake. It is Papa Ramure. Through his\r\nunbuttoned greatcoat and jacket I see bandages around his chest. "The\r\nambulance men have been to tuck me up," he says, in a weak and\r\nstertorous voice, "but they can\'t take me away from here before\r\nevening. But I know all right that I\'m petering out every minute."\r\n\r\nHe jerks his head. "Stay a bit," he asks me. He is much moved, and the\r\ntears are flowing. He offers his hand and holds mine. He wants to say a\r\nlot of things to me and almost to make confession. "I was a straight\r\nman before the war," he says, with trickling tears; "I worked from\r\nmorning to night to feed my little lot. And then I came here to kill\r\nBoches. And now, I\'ve got killed. Listen, listen, listen, don\'t go\r\naway, listen to me--"\r\n\r\n"I must take Joseph back--he\'s at the end of his strength. I\'ll come\r\nback afterwards."\r\n\r\nRamure lifted his streaming eyes to the wounded man. "Not only living,\r\nbut wounded! Escaped from death! Ah, some women and children are lucky!\r\nAll right, take him, take him, and come back--I hope I shall be waiting\r\nfor you--"\r\n\r\nNow we must climb the other slope of the ravine, and we enter the\r\ndeformed and maltreated ditch of the old Trench 97.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a frantic whistling tears the air and there is a shower of\r\nshrapnel above us. Meteorites flash and scatter in fearful flight in\r\nthe heart of the yellow clouds. Revolving missiles rush through the\r\nheavens to break and burn upon the bill, to ransack it and exhume the\r\nold bones of men; and the thundering flames multiply themselves along\r\nan even line.\r\n\r\nIt is the barrage fire beginning again. Like children we cry, "Enough,\r\nenough!"\r\n\r\nIn this fury of fatal engines, this mechanical cataclysm that pursues\r\nus through space, there is something that surpasses human strength and\r\nwill, something supernatural. Joseph, standing with his hand in mine,\r\nlooks over his shoulder at the storm of rending explosions. He bows his\r\nhead like an imprisoned beast, distracted: "What, again! Always, then!"\r\nhe growls; "after all we\'ve done and all we\'ve seen--and now it begins\r\nagain! Ah, non, non!"\r\n\r\nHe falls on his knees, gasps for breath, and throws a futile look of\r\nfull hatred before him and behind him. He repeats, "It\'s never\r\nfinished, never!"\r\n\r\nI take him by the arm and raise him. "Come; it\'ll be finished for you."\r\n\r\nWe must dally there awhile before climbing, so I will go and bring back\r\nRamure in extremis, who is waiting for me. But Joseph clings to me, and\r\nthen I notice a movement of men about the spot where I left the dying\r\nman. I can guess what it means; it is no longer worth while to go there.\r\n\r\nThe ground of the ravine where we two are closely clustered to abide\r\nthe tempest is quivering, and at each shot we feel the deep simoom of\r\nthe shells. But in the hole where we are there is scarcely any risk of\r\nbeing hit. At the first lull, some of the men who were also waiting\r\ndetach themselves and begin to go up; stretcher-bearers redouble their\r\nhuge efforts to carry a body and climb, making one think of stubborn\r\nants pushed back by successive grains of sand; wounded men and liaison\r\nmen move again.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go on," says Joseph, with sagging shoulders, as he measures the\r\nhill with his eye--the last stage of his Gethsemane.\r\n\r\nThere are trees here; a row of excoriated willow trunks, some of wide\r\ncountenance, and others hollowed and yawning, like coffins on end. The\r\nscene through which we are struggling is rent and convulsed, with hills\r\nand chasms, and with such somber swellings as if all the clouds of\r\nstorm had rolled down here. Above the tortured earth, this stampeded\r\nfile of trunks stands forth against a striped brown sky, milky in\r\nplaces and obscurely sparkling--a sky of agate.\r\n\r\nAcross the entry to Trench 97 a felled oak twists his great body, and a\r\ncorpse stops up the trench. Its head and legs are buried in the ground.\r\nThe dirty water that trickles in the trench has covered it with a sandy\r\nglaze, and through the moist deposit the chest and belly bulge forth,\r\nclad in a shirt. We stride over the frigid remains, slimy and pale,\r\nthat suggest the belly of a stranded crocodile; and it is difficult to\r\ndo so, by reason of the soft and slippery ground. We have to plunge our\r\nhands up to the wrists in the mud of the wall.\r\n\r\nAt this moment an infernal whistle falls on us and we bend like bushes.\r\nThe shell bursts in the air in front of us, deafening and blinding, and\r\nburies us under a horribly sibilant mountain of dark smoke. A climbing\r\nsoldier has churned the air with his arms and disappeared, hurled into\r\nsome hole. Shouts have gone up and fallen again like rubbish. While we\r\nare looking, through the great black veil that the wind tears from the\r\nground and dismisses into the sky, at the bearers who are putting down\r\na stretcher, running to the place of the explosion and picking up\r\nsomething inert--I recall the unforgettable scene when my\r\nbrother-in-arms, Poterloo, whose heart was so full of hope, vanished\r\nwith his arms outstretched in the flame of a shell.\r\n\r\nWe arrive at last on the summit, which is marked as with a signal by a\r\nwounded and frightful man. He is upright in the wind, shaken but\r\nupright, enrooted there. In his uplifted and wind-tossed cape we see a\r\nyelling and convulsive face. We pass by him, and he is like a sort of\r\nscreaming tree.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at our old first line, the one from which we set off\r\nfor the attack. We sit down on a firing-step with our backs to the\r\nholes cut for our exodus at the last minute by the sappers. Euterpe,\r\nthe cyclist, passes and gives us good-day. Then he turns in his tracks\r\nand draws from the cuff of his coat-sleeve an envelope, whose\r\nprotruding edge had conferred a white stripe on him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s you, isn\'t it," he says to me, "that takes Biquet\'s letters\r\nthat\'s dead?"--"Yes."--"Here\'s a returned one; the address has hopped\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThe envelope was exposed, no doubt, to rain on the top of a packet, and\r\nthe address is no longer legible among the violet mottlings on the\r\ndried and frayed paper. Alone there survives in a corner the address of\r\nthe sender. I pull the letter out gently--"My dear mother"--Ah, I\r\nremember! Biquet, now lying in the open air in the very trench where we\r\nare halted, wrote that letter not long ago in our quarters at\r\nGauchin-l\'Abbe, one flaming and splendid afternoon, in reply to a\r\nletter from his mother, whose fears for him had proved groundless and\r\nmade him laugh--"You think I\'m in the cold and rain and danger. Not at\r\nall; on the contrary, all that\'s finished. It\'s hot, we\'re sweating,\r\nand we\'ve nothing to do only to stroll about in the sunshine. I laughed\r\nto read your letter--"\r\n\r\nI return to the frail and damaged envelope the letter which, if chance\r\nhad not averted this new irony, would have been read by the old peasant\r\nwoman at the moment when the body of her son is a wet nothing in the\r\ncold and the storm, a nothing that trickles and flows like a dark\r\nspring on the wall of the trench.\r\n\r\nJoseph has leaned his head backwards. His eyes close for a moment, his\r\nmouth half opens, and his breathing is fitful.\r\n\r\n"Courage!" I say to him, and he opens his eyes again.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he replies, "it isn\'t to me you should say that. Look at those\r\nchaps, there, they\'re going back yonder, and you too, you\'re going\r\nback. It all has to go on for you others. Ah, one must be really strong\r\nto go on, to go on!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nThe Refuge\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM this point onwards we are in sight of the enemy observation-posts,\r\nand must no longer leave the communication trenches. First we follow\r\nthat of the Pylones road. The trench is cut along the side of the road,\r\nand the road itself is wiped out; so are its trees. Half of it, all the\r\nway along, has been chewed and swallowed by the trench; and what is\r\nleft of it has been invaded by the earth and the grass, and mingled\r\nwith the fields in the fullness of time. At some places in the\r\ntrench--there, where a sandbag has burst and left only a muddy\r\ncell--you may see again on the level of your eyes the stony ballast of\r\nthe ex-road, cut to the quick, or even the roots of the bordering trees\r\nthat have been cut down to embody in the trench wall. The latter is as\r\nslashed and uneven as if it were a wave of earth and rubbish and dark\r\nscum that the immense plain has spat out and pushed against the edge of\r\nthe trench.\r\n\r\nWe arrive at a junction of trenches, and on the top of the maltreated\r\nhillock which is outlined on the cloudy grayness, a mournful signboard\r\nstands crookedly in the wind. The trench system becomes still more\r\ncramped and close, and the men who are flowing towards the\r\nclearing-station from all parts of the sector multiply and throng in\r\nthe deep-dug ways.\r\n\r\nThese lamentable lanes are staked out with corpses. At uneven intervals\r\ntheir walls are broken into by quite recent gaps, extending to their\r\nfull depth, by funnelholes of fresh earth which trespass upon the\r\nunwholesome land beyond, where earthy bodies are squatting with their\r\nchins on their knees or leaning against the wall as straight and silent\r\nas the rifles which wait beside them. Some of these standing dead turn\r\ntheir blood-bespattered faces towards the survivors; others exchange\r\ntheir looks with the sky\'s emptiness.\r\n\r\nJoseph halts to take breath. I say to him as to a child, "We\'re nearly\r\nthere, we\'re nearly there."\r\n\r\nThe sinister ramparts of this way of desolation contract still more.\r\nThey impel a feeling of suffocation, of a nightmare of falling which\r\noppresses and strangles: and in these depths where the walls seem to be\r\ncoming nearer and closing in, you are forced to halt, to wriggle a path\r\nfor yourself, to vex and disturb the dead, to be pushed about by the\r\nendless disorder of the files that flow along these hinder trenches,\r\nfiles made up of messengers, of the maimed, of men who groan and who\r\ncry aloud, who hurry frantically, crimsoned by fever or pallid and\r\nvisibly shaken by pain.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAll this throng at last pulls up and gathers and groans at the\r\ncrossways where the burrows of the Refuge open out.\r\n\r\nA doctor is trying with shouts and gesticulations to keep a little\r\nspace clear from the rising tide that beats upon the threshold of the\r\nshelter, where he applies summary bandages in the open air; they say he\r\nhas not ceased to do it, nor his helpers either, all the night and all\r\nthe day, that he is accomplishing a superhuman task.\r\n\r\nWhen they leave his hands, some of the wounded are swallowed up by the\r\nblack hole of the Refuge; others are sent back to the bigger\r\nclearing-station contrived in the trench on the Bethune road.\r\n\r\nIn this confined cavity formed by the crossing of the ditches, in the\r\nbottom of a sort of robbers\' den, we waited two hours, buffeted,\r\nsqueezed, choked and blinded, climbing over each other like cattle, in\r\nan odor of blood and butchery. There are faces that become more\r\ndistorted and emaciated from minute to minute. One of the patients can\r\nno longer hold back his tears; they come in floods, and as he shakes\r\nhis head he sprinkles his neighbors. Another, bleeding like a fountain,\r\nshouts, "Hey, there! have a look at me!" A young man with burning eyes\r\nyells like a soul in hell, "I\'m on fire!" and he roars and blows like a\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nJoseph is bandaged. He thrusts a way through to me and holds out his\r\nhand: "It isn\'t serious, it seems; good-by," he says.\r\n\r\nAt once we are separated in the mob. With my last glance I see his\r\nwasted face and the vacant absorption in his trouble as he is meekly\r\nled away by a Divisional stretcher-bearer whose hand is on his\r\nshoulder; and suddenly I see him no more. In war, life separates us\r\njust as death does, without our having even the time to think about it.\r\n\r\nThey tell me not to stay there, but to go down into the Refuge to rest\r\nbefore returning. There are two entries, very low and very narrow, on\r\nthe level of the ground. This one is flush with the mouth of a sloping\r\ngallery, narrow as the conduit of a sewer. In order to penetrate the\r\nRefuge, one must first turn round and work backwards with bent body\r\ninto the shrunken pipe, and here the feet discover steps. Every three\r\npaces there is a deep step.\r\n\r\nOnce inside you have a first impression of being trapped--that there is\r\nnot room enough either to descend or climb out. As you go on burying\r\nyourself in the gulf, the nightmare of suffocation continues that you\r\nprogressively endured as you advanced along the bowels of the trenches\r\nbefore foundering in here. On all sides you bump and scrape yourself,\r\nyou are clutched by the tightness of the passage, you are wedged and\r\nstuck. I have to change the position of my cartridge pouches by sliding\r\nthem round the belt and to take my bags in my arms against my chest. At\r\nthe fourth step the suffocation increases still more and one has a\r\nmoment of agony; little as one may lift his knee for the rearward step,\r\nhis back strikes the roof. In this spot it is necessary to go on all\r\nfours, still backwards. As you go down into the depth, a pestilent\r\natmosphere and heavy as earth buries you. Your hands touch only the\r\ncold, sticky and sepulchral clay of the wall, which bears you down on\r\nall sides and enshrouds you in a dismal solitude; its blind and moldy\r\nbreath touches your face. On the last steps, reached after long labor,\r\none is assailed by a hot, unearthly clamor that rises from the hole as\r\nfrom a sort of kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach at last the bottom of this laddered sap that elbows and\r\ncompresses you at every step, the evil dream is not ended, for you find\r\nyourself in a lone but very narrow cavern where gloom reigns, a mere\r\ncorridor not more than five feet high. If you cease to stoop and to\r\nwalk with bended knees, your head violently strikes the planks that\r\nroof the Refuge, and the newcomers are heard to growl--more or less\r\nforcefully, according to their temper and condition--"Ah, lucky I\'ve\r\ngot my tin hat on:"\r\n\r\nOne makes out the gesture of some one who is squatting in an angle. It\r\nis an ambulance man on guard, whose monotone says to each arrival,\r\n"Take the mud off your boots before going in." So you stumble into an\r\naccumulating pile of mud; it entangles you at the foot of the steps on\r\nthis threshold of hell.\r\n\r\nIn the hubbub of lamentation and groaning, in the strong smell of a\r\ncountless concentration of wounds, in this blinking cavern of confused\r\nand unintelligible life, I try first to get my bearings. Some weak\r\ncandle flames are shining along the Refuge, but they only relieve the\r\ndarkness in the spots where they pierce it. At the farthest end faint\r\ndaylight appears, as it might to a dungeon prisoner at the bottom of an\r\noubliette. This obscure vent-hole allows one to make out some big\r\nobjects ranged along the corridor; they are low stretchers, like\r\ncoffins. Around and above them one then dimly discerns the movement of\r\nbroken and drooping shadows, and the stirring of ranks and groups of\r\nspecters against the walls.\r\n\r\nI turn round. At the end opposite that where the faraway light leaks\r\nthrough, a mob is gathered in front of a tent-cloth which reaches from\r\nthe ceiling to the ground, and thus forms an apartment, whose\r\nillumination shines through the oily yellow material. In this retreat,\r\nanti-tetanus injections are going on by the light of an acetylene lamp.\r\nWhen the cloth is lifted to allow some one to enter or leave, the glare\r\nbrutally besplashes the disordered rags of the wounded stationed in\r\nfront to await their treatment. Bowed by the ceiling, seated, kneeling\r\nor groveling, they push each other in the desire not to lose their turn\r\nor to steal some other\'s, and they bark like dogs, "My\r\nturn!"--"Me!"--"Me!" In this corner of modified conflict the tepid\r\nstinks of acetylene and bleeding men are horrible to swallow.\r\n\r\nI turn away from it and seek elsewhere to find a place where I may sit\r\ndown. I go forward a little, groping, still stooping and curled up, and\r\nmy hands in front.\r\n\r\nBy grace of the flame which a smoker holds over his pipe I see a bench\r\nbefore me, full of beings. My eyes are growing accustomed to the gloom\r\nthat stagnates in the cave, and I can make out pretty well this row of\r\npeople whose bandages and swathings dimly whiten their heads and limbs.\r\nCrippled, gashed, deformed, motionless or restless, fast fixed in this\r\nkind of barge, they present an incongruous collection of suffering and\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nOne of them cries out suddenly, half rises, and then sits down again.\r\nHis neighbor, whose greatcoat is torn and his head bare, looks at him\r\nand says to him--"What\'s the use of worrying?"\r\n\r\nAnd he repeats the sentence several times at random, gazing straight in\r\nfront of him, his hands on his knees. A young man in the middle of the\r\nseat is talking to himself. He says that he is an aviator. There are\r\nburns down one side of his body and on his face. In his fever he is\r\nstill burning; it seems to him that he is still gnawed by the pointed\r\nflames that leaped from his engine. He is muttering, "Gott mit uns!"\r\nand then, "God is with us!"\r\n\r\nA zouave with his arm in a sling, who sits awry and seems to carry his\r\nshoulder like a torturing burden, speaks to him: "You\'re the aviator\r\nthat fell, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen--things," replies the flying-man laboriously.\r\n\r\n"I too, I\'ve seen some!" the soldier interrupts; "some people couldn\'t\r\nstick it, to see what I\'ve seen."\r\n\r\n"Come and sit here," says one of the men on the seat to me, making room\r\nas he speaks. "Are you wounded?"\r\n\r\n"No; I brought a wounded man here, and I\'m going back."\r\n\r\n"You\'re worse than wounded then; come and sit down."\r\n\r\n"I was mayor in my place," explains one of the sufferers, "but when I\r\ngo back no one will know me again, it\'s so long now that I\'ve been in\r\nmisery."\r\n\r\n"Four hours now have I been stuck on this bench," groans a sort of\r\nmendicant, whose shaking hand holds his helmet on his knees like an\r\nalms-bowl, whose head is lowered and his back rounded.\r\n\r\n"We\'re waiting to be cleared, you know," I am informed by a big man who\r\npants and sweats--all the bulk of him seems to be boiling. His mustache\r\nhangs as if it had come half unstuck through the moisture of his face.\r\nHe turns two big and lightless eyes on me, and his wound is not visible.\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," says another; "all the wounded of the Brigade come and\r\npile themselves up here one after another, without counting them from\r\nother places. Yes, look at it now; this hole here, it\'s the midden for\r\nthe whole Brigade."\r\n\r\n"I\'m gangrened, I\'m smashed, I\'m all in bits inside," droned one who\r\nsat with his head in his hands and spoke through his fingers; "yet up\r\nto last week I was young and I was clean. They\'ve changed me. Now, I\'ve\r\ngot nothing but a dirty old decomposed body to drag along."\r\n\r\n"Yesterday," says another, "I was twenty-six years old. And now how old\r\nam I?" He tries to get up, so as to show us his shaking and faded face,\r\nworn out in a night, to show us the emaciation, the depression of\r\ncheeks and eye-sockets, and the dying flicker of light in his greasy\r\neye.\r\n\r\n"It hurts!" humbly says some one invisible.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of worrying?" repeats the other mechanically.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, and then the aviator cried, "The padres were\r\ntrying on both sides to hide their voices."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that mean?" said the astonished zouave.\r\n\r\n"Are you taking leave of \'em, old chap?" asked a chasseur wounded in\r\nthe hand and with one arm bound to his body, as his eyes left the\r\nmummified limb for a moment to glance at the flying-man.\r\n\r\nThe latter\'s looks were distraught; he was trying to interpret a\r\nmysterious picture which everywhere he saw before his eyes--"Up there,\r\nfrom the sky, you don\'t see much, you know. Among the squares of the\r\nfields and the little heaps of the villages the roads run like white\r\ncotton. You can make out, too, some hollow threads that look as if\r\nthey\'d been traced with a pin-point and scratched through fine sand.\r\nThese nets that festoon the plain with regularly wavy marks, they\'re\r\nthe trenches. Last Sunday morning I was flying over the firing-line.\r\nBetween our first lines and their first lines, between their extreme\r\nedges, between the fringes of the two huge armies that are up against\r\neach other, looking at each other and not seeing, and waiting--it\'s not\r\nvery far; sometimes forty yards, sometimes sixty. To me it looked about\r\na stride, at the great height where I was planing. And behold I could\r\nmake out two crowds, one among the Boches, and one of ours, in these\r\nparallel lines that seemed to touch each other; each was a solid,\r\nlively lump, and all around \'em were dots like grains of black sand\r\nscattered on gray sand, and these hardly budged--it didn\'t look like an\r\nalarm! So I went down several turns to investigate.\r\n\r\n"Then I understood. It was Sunday, and there were two religious\r\nservices being held under my eyes--the altar, the padre, and all the\r\ncrowd of chaps. The more I went down the more I could see that the two\r\nthings were alike--so exactly alike that it looked silly. One of the\r\nservices--whichever you like--was a reflection of the other, and I\r\nwondered if I was seeing double. I went down lower; they didn\'t fire at\r\nme. Why? I don\'t know at all. Then I could hear. I heard one murmur,\r\none only. I could only gather a single prayer that came up to me en\r\nbloc, the sound of a single chant that passed by me on its way to\r\nheaven. I went to and fro in space to listen to this faint mixture of\r\nhymns that blended together just the same although they were one\r\nagainst the other; and the more they tried to get on top of each other,\r\nthe more they were blended together up in the heights of the sky where\r\nI was floating.\r\n\r\n"I got some shrapnel just at the moment when, very low down, I made out\r\nthe two voices from the earth that made up the one--\'Gott mit uns!\' and\r\n\'God is with us!\'--and I flew away."\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his bandage-covered head; he seemed deranged by the\r\nrecollection. "I said to myself at the moment, \'I must be mad!\'"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the truth of things that\'s mad," said the zouave.\r\n\r\nWith his eyes shining in delirium, the narrator sought to express and\r\nconvey the deep disturbing idea that was besieging him, that he was\r\nstruggling against.\r\n\r\n"Now think of it!" he said. "Fancy those two identical crowds yelling\r\nthings that are identical and yet opposite, these identical enemy\r\ncries! What must the good God think about it all? I know well enough\r\nthat He knows everything, but even if He knows everything, He won\'t\r\nknow what to make of it."\r\n\r\n"Rot!" cried the zouave.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t care a damn for us, don\'t fret yourself."\r\n\r\n"Anyway, what is there funny about it? That doesn\'t prevent people from\r\nquarreling with each other--and don\'t they! And rifle-shots speak jolly\r\nwell the same language, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the aviator, "but there\'s only one God. It isn\'t the\r\ndeparture of prayers that I don\'t understand; it\'s their arrival."\r\n\r\nThe conversation dropped.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a crowd of wounded laid out in there," the man with the dull\r\neyes said to me, "and I\'m wondering all ways how they got \'em down\r\nhere. It must have been a terrible job, tumbling them in here."\r\n\r\nTwo Colonials, hard and lean, supporting each other like tipsy men,\r\nbutted into us and recoiled, looking on the ground for some place to\r\nfall on.\r\n\r\n"Old chap, in that trench I\'m telling you of," the hoarse voice of one\r\nwas relating, "we were three days without rations, three full days\r\nwithout anything--anything. Willy-nilly, we had to drink our own water,\r\nand no help for it."\r\n\r\nThe other explained that once on a time he had cholera. "Ah, that\'s a\r\ndirty business--fever, vomiting, colics; old man, I was ill with that\r\nlot!"\r\n\r\n"And then, too," suddenly growled the flying-man, still fierce to\r\npursue the answer to the gigantic conundrum, "what is this God thinking\r\nof to let everybody believe like that that He\'s with them? Why does He\r\nlet us all--all of us--shout out side by side, like idiots and brutes,\r\n\'God is with us!\'--\'No, not at all, you\'re wrong; God is with us\'?"\r\n\r\nA groan arose from a stretcher, and for a moment fluttered lonely in\r\nthe silence as if it were an answer.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThen, "I don\'t believe in God," said a pain-racked voice; "I know He\r\ndoesn\'t exist--because of the suffering there is. They can tell us all\r\nthe clap-trap they like, and trim up all the words they can find and\r\nall they can make up, but to say that all this innocent suffering could\r\ncome from a perfect God, it\'s damned skull-stuffing."\r\n\r\n"For my part," another of the men on the seat goes on, "I don\'t believe\r\nin God because of the cold. I\'ve seen men become corpses bit by bit,\r\njust simply with cold. If there was a God of goodness, there wouldn\'t\r\nbe any cold. You can\'t get away from that."\r\n\r\n"Before you can believe in God, you\'ve got to do away with everything\r\nthere is. So we\'ve got a long way to go!"\r\n\r\nSeveral mutilated men, without seeing each other, combine in\r\nhead-shakes of dissent "You\'re right," says another, "you\'re right."\r\n\r\nThese men in ruins, vanquished in victory, isolated and scattered, have\r\nthe beginnings of a revelation. There come moments in the tragedy of\r\nthese events when men are not only sincere, but truth-telling, moments\r\nwhen you see that they and the truth are face to face.\r\n\r\n"As for me," said a new speaker, "if I don\'t believe in God, it\'s--" A\r\nfit of coughing terribly continued his sentence.\r\n\r\nWhen the fit passed and his cheeks were purple and wet with tears, some\r\none asked him, "Where are you wounded?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not wounded; I\'m ill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see!" they said, in a tone which meant "You\'re not interesting."\r\n\r\nHe understood, and pleaded the cause of his illness:\r\n\r\n"I\'m done in, I spit blood. I\'ve no strength left, and it doesn\'t come\r\nback, you know, when it goes away like that."\r\n\r\n"Ah, ah!" murmured the comrades--wavering, but secretly convinced all\r\nthe same of the inferiority of civilian ailments to wounds.\r\n\r\nIn resignation he lowered his head and repeated to himself very\r\nquietly, "I can\'t walk any more; where would you have me go?"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nA commotion is arising for some unknown reason in the horizontal gulf\r\nwhich lengthens as it contracts from stretcher to stretcher as far as\r\nthe eye can see, as far as the pallid peep of daylight, in this\r\nconfused corridor where the poor winking flames of candles redden and\r\nseem feverish, and winged shadows cast themselves. The odds and ends of\r\nheads and limbs are agitated, appeals and cries arouse each other and\r\nincrease in number like invisible ghosts. The prostrate bodies\r\nundulate, double up, and turn over.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of this den of captives, debased and punished by pain, I\r\nmake out the big mass of a hospital attendant whose heavy shoulders\r\nrise and fall like a knapsack carried crosswise, and whose stentorian\r\nvoice reverberates at speed through the cave. "You\'ve been meddling\r\nwith your bandage again, you son of a lubber, you varmint!" he\r\nthunders. "I\'ll do it up again for you, as long as it\'s you, my chick,\r\nbut if you touch it again, you\'ll see what I\'ll do to you!"\r\n\r\nBehold him then in the obscurity, twisting a bandage round the cranium\r\nof a very little man who is almost upright, who has bristling hair and\r\na beard which puffs out in front. With dangling arms, he submits in\r\nsilence. But the attendant abandons him, looks on the ground and\r\nexclaims sonorously, "What the--? Eh, come now, my friend, are you\r\ncracked? There\'s manners for you, to lie down on the top of a patient!"\r\nAnd his capacious hand disengages a second limp body on which the first\r\nhad extended himself as on a mattress; while the mannikin with the\r\nbandaged head alongside, as soon as he is let alone, puts his hands to\r\nhis head without saying a word and tries once more to remove the\r\nencircling lint.\r\n\r\nThere is an uproar, too, among some shadows that are visible against a\r\nluminous background; they seem to be wildly agitated in the gloom of\r\nthe crypt. The light of a candle shows us several men shaken with their\r\nefforts to hold a wounded soldier down on his stretcher. It is a man\r\nwhose feet are gone. At the end of his legs are terrible bandages, with\r\ntourniquets to restrain the hemorrhage. His stumps have bled into the\r\nlinen wrappings, and he seems to wear red breeches. His face is\r\ndevilish, shining and sullen, and he is raving. They are pressing down\r\non his shoulders and knees, for this man without feet would fain jump\r\nfrom the stretcher and go away.\r\n\r\n"Let me go!" he rattles in breathless, quavering rage. His voice is\r\nlow, with sudden sonorities, like a trumpet that one tries to blow too\r\nsoftly. "By God, let me go, I tell you! Do you think I\'m going to stop\r\nhere? Allons, let me be, or I\'ll jump over you on my hands!"\r\n\r\nSo violently he contracts and extends himself that he pulls to and fro\r\nthose who are trying to restrain him by their gripping weight, and I\r\ncan see the zigzags of the candle held by a kneeling man whose other\r\narm engirdles the mutilated maniac, who shouts so fiercely that he\r\nwakes up the sleepers and dispels the drowsiness of the rest. On all\r\nsides they turn towards him; half rising, they listen to the incoherent\r\nlamentations which end by dying in the dark. At the same moment, in\r\nanother corner, two prostrate wounded, crucified on the ground, so\r\ncurse each other that one of them has to be removed before the frantic\r\ndialogue is broken up.\r\n\r\nI go farther away, towards the point where the light from outside comes\r\nthrough among the tangled beams as through a broken grating, and stride\r\nover the interminable stretchers that take up all the width of the\r\nunderground alley whose oppressive confinement chokes me. The human\r\nforms prone on the stretchers are now hardly stirring under the\r\nJack-o\'-lanterns of the candles; they stagnate in their rattling breath\r\nand heavy groans.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of a stretcher a man is sitting, leaning against the wall.\r\nHis clothes are torn apart, and in the middle of their darkness appears\r\nthe white, emaciated breast of a martyr. His head is bent quite back\r\nand veiled in shadow, but I can see the beating of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe daylight that is trickling through at the end, drop by drop, comes\r\nin by an earth-fall. Several shells, falling on the same spot, have\r\nbroken through the heavy earthen roof of the Refuge.\r\n\r\nHere, some pale reflections are cast on the blue of the greatcoats, on\r\nthe shoulders and along the folds. Almost paralyzed by the darkness and\r\ntheir own weakness, a group of men is pressing towards the gap, like\r\ndead men half awaking, to taste a little of the pallid air and detach\r\nthemselves from the sepulcher. This corner at the extremity of the\r\ngloom offers itself as a way of escape, an oasis where one may stand\r\nupright, where one is lightly, angelically touched by the light of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n"There were some chaps there that were blown to bits when the shells\r\nburst," said some one to me who was waiting there in the sickly ray of\r\nentombed light. "You talk about a mess! Look, there\'s the padre hooking\r\ndown what was blown up."\r\n\r\nThe huge Red Cross sergeant, in a hunter\'s chestnut waistcoat which\r\ngives him the chest of a gorilla, is detaching the pendent entrails\r\ntwisted among the beams of the shattered woodwork. For the purpose he\r\nis using a rifle with fixed bayonet, since he could not find a stick\r\nlong enough; and the heavy giant, bald, bearded and asthmatic, wields\r\nthe weapon awkwardly. He has a mild face, meek and unhappy, and while\r\nhe tries to catch the remains of intestines in the corners, he mutters\r\na string of "Oh\'s!" like sighs. His eyes are masked by blue glasses;\r\nhis breathing is noisy. The top of his head is of puny dimensions, and\r\nthe huge thickness of his neck has a conical shape. To see him thus\r\npricking and unhanging from the air strips of viscera and rags of\r\nflesh, you could take him for a butcher at some fiendish task.\r\n\r\nBut I let myself fall in a corner with my eyes half closed, seeing\r\nhardly anything of the spectacle that lies and palpitates and falls\r\naround me. Indistinctly I gather some fragments of sentences--still the\r\nhorrible monotony of the story of wounds: "Nom de Dieu! In that place I\r\nshould think the bullets were touching each other."--"His head was\r\nbored through from one temple to the other. You could have passed a\r\nthread through."\r\n\r\n"Those beggars were an hour before they lifted their fire and stopped\r\npeppering us." Nearer to me some one gabbles at the end of his story,\r\n"When I\'m sleeping I dream that I\'m killing him over again!"\r\n\r\nOther memories are called up and buzz about among the buried wounded;\r\nit is like the purring of countless gear-wheels in a machine that turns\r\nand turns. And I hear afar him who repeats from his seat, "What\'s the\r\nuse of worrying?" in all possible tones, commanding a pitiful,\r\nsometimes like a prophet and anon like one shipwrecked; he metrifies\r\nwith his cry the chorus of choking and plaintive voices that try so\r\nterribly to extol their suffering.\r\n\r\nSome one comes forward, blindly feeling the wall with his stick, and\r\nreaches me. It is Farfadet! I call him, and he turns nearly towards me\r\nto tell me that one eye is gone, and the other is bandaged as well. I\r\ngive him my place, take him by the shoulders and make him sit down. He\r\nsubmits, and seated at the base of the wall waits patiently, with the\r\nresignation of his clerkly calling, as if in a waiting-room.\r\n\r\nI come to anchor a little farther away, in an empty space where two\r\nprostrate men are talking to each other in low voices; they are so near\r\nto me that I hear them without listening. They are two soldiers of the\r\nForeign Legion; their helmets and greatcoats are dark yellow.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not worth while to make-believe about it," says one of them\r\nbanteringly. "I\'m staying here this time. It\'s finished--my bowels are\r\nshot through. If I were in a hospital, in a town, they\'d operate on me\r\nin time, and it might stick up again. But here! It was yesterday I got\r\nit. We\'re two or three hours from the Bethune road, aren\'t we? And how\r\nmany hours, think you, from the road to an ambulance where they can\r\noperate? And then, when are they going to pick us up? It\'s nobody\'s\r\nfault, I dare say; but you\'ve got to look facts in the face. Oh, I know\r\nit isn\'t going to be any worse from now than it is, but it can\'t be\r\nlong, seeing I\'ve a hole all the way through my parcel of guts. You,\r\nyour foot\'ll get all right, or they\'ll put you another one on. But I\'m\r\ngoing to die."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the other, convinced by the reasoning of his neighbor. The\r\nlatter goes on--"Listen, Dominique. You\'ve led a bad life. You cribbed\r\nthings, and you were quarrelsome when drunk. You\'ve dirtied your ticket\r\nin the police register, properly."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say it isn\'t true, because it is," says the other; "but what\r\nhave you got to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll lead a bad life again after the war, inevitably; and then\r\nyou\'ll have bother about that affair of the cooper."\r\n\r\nThe other becomes fierce and aggressive. "What the hell\'s it to do with\r\nyou? Shut your jaw!"\r\n\r\n"As for me, I\'ve no more family than you have. I\'ve nobody, except\r\nLouise--and she isn\'t a relation of mine, seeing we\'re not married. And\r\nthere are no convictions against me, beyond a few little military jobs.\r\nThere\'s nothing on my name."\r\n\r\n"Well, what about it? I don\'t care a damn."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to tell you. Take my name. Take it--I give it you; as long\r\nas neither of us has any family."\r\n\r\n"Your name?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you\'ll call yourself Leonard Carlotti, that\'s all. \'Tisn\'t a big\r\njob. What harm can it do you? Straight off, you\'ve no more convictions.\r\nThey won\'t hunt you out, and you can be as happy as I should have been\r\nif this bullet hadn\'t gone through my magazine."\r\n\r\n"Oh Christ!" said the other, "you\'d do that? You\'d--that--well, old\r\nchap, that beats all!"\r\n\r\n"Take it. It\'s there in my pocket-book in my greatcoat. Go on, take it,\r\nand hand yours over to me--so that I can carry it all away with me.\r\nYou\'ll be able to live where you like, except where I come from, where\r\nI\'m known a bit, at Longueville in Tunis. You\'ll remember that? And\r\nanyway, it\'s written down. You must read it, the pocket-book. I shan\'t\r\nblab to anybody. To bring the trick off properly, mum\'s the word,\r\nabsolutely."\r\n\r\nHe ponders a moment, and then says with a shiver "I\'ll p\'raps tell\r\nLouise, so\'s she\'ll find I\'ve done the right thing, and think the\r\nbetter of me, when I write to her to say good-by."\r\n\r\nBut he thinks better of it, and shakes his head with an heroic effort.\r\n"No--I shan\'t let on, even to her. She\'s her, of course, but women are\r\nsuch chatterers!"\r\n\r\nThe other man looks at him, and repeats, "Ah, nome de Dieu!"\r\n\r\nWithout being noticed by the two men I leave the drama narrowly\r\ndeveloping in this lamentable corner and its jostling and traffic and\r\nhubbub.\r\n\r\nNow I touch the composed and convalescent chat of two poor\r\nwretches--"Ah, my boy, the affection he had for that vine of his! You\r\ncouldn\'t find anything wrong among the branches of it--"\r\n\r\n"That little nipper, that wee little kid, when I went out with him,\r\nholding his tiny fist, it felt as if I\'d got hold of the little warm\r\nneck of a swallow, you know."\r\n\r\nAnd alongside this sentimental avowal, here is the passing revelation\r\nof another mind: "Don\'t I know the 547th! Rather! Listen, it\'s a funny\r\nregiment. They\'ve got a poilu in it who\'s called Petitjean, another\r\ncalled Petitpierre, and another called Petitlouis. Old man, it\'s as I\'m\r\ntelling you; that\'s the kind of regiment it is."\r\n\r\nAs I begin to pick out a way with a view to leaving the cavern, there\r\nis a great noise down yonder of a fall and a chorus of exclamations. It\r\nis the hospital sergeant who has fallen. Through the breach that he was\r\nclearing of its soft and bloody relics, a bullet has taken him in the\r\nthroat, and he is spread out full length on the ground. His great\r\nbewildered eyes are rolling and his breath comes foaming. His mouth and\r\nthe lower part of his face are quickly covered with a cloud of rosy\r\nbubbles. They place his head on a bag of bandages, and the bag is\r\ninstantly soaked with blood. An attendant cries that the packets of\r\nlint will be spoiled, and they are needed. Something else is sought on\r\nwhich to put the head that ceaselessly makes a light and discolored\r\nfroth. Only a loaf can be found, and it is slid under the spongy hair.\r\n\r\nWhile they hold the sergeant\'s hand and question him, he only slavers\r\nnew heaps of bubbles, and we see his great black-bearded head across\r\nthis rosy cloud. Laid out like that, he might be a deep-breathing\r\nmarine monster, and the transparent red foam gathers and creeps up to\r\nhis great hazy eyes, no longer spectacled.\r\n\r\nThen his throat rattles. It is a childish rattle, and he dies moving\r\nhis head to right and to left as though he were trying very gently to\r\nsay "No."\r\n\r\nLooking on the enormous inert mass, I reflect that he was a good man.\r\nHe had an innocent and impressionable heart. How I reproach myself that\r\nI sometimes abused him for the ingenuous narrowness of his views, and\r\nfor a certain clerical impertinence that he always had! And how glad I\r\nam in this distressing scene--yes, happy enough to tremble with\r\njoy--that I restrained myself from an angry protest when I found him\r\nstealthily reading a letter I was writing, a protest that would\r\nunjustly have wounded him! I remember the time when he exasperated me\r\nso much by his dissertation on France and the Virgin Mary. It seemed\r\nimpossible to me that he could utter those thoughts sincerely. Why\r\nshould he not have been sincere? Has he not been really killed today? I\r\nremember, too, certain deeds of devotion, the kindly patience of the\r\ngreat man, exiled in war as in life--and the rest does not matter. His\r\nideas themselves are only trivial details compared with his\r\nheart--which is there on the ground in ruins in this corner of Hell.\r\nWith what intensity I lamented this man who was so far asunder from me\r\nin everything!\r\n\r\nThen fell the thunder on us! We were thrown violently on each other by\r\nthe frightful shaking of the ground and the walls. It was as if the\r\noverhanging earth had burst and hurled itself down. Part of the\r\narmor-plate of beams collapsed, enlarging the hole that already pierced\r\nthe cavern. Another shock--another pulverized span fell in roaring\r\ndestruction. The corpse of the great Red Cross sergeant went rolling\r\nagainst the wall like the trunk of a tree. All the timber in the long\r\nframe-work of the cave, those heavy black vertebrae, cracked with an\r\near-splitting noise, and all the prisoners in the dungeon shouted\r\ntogether in horror.\r\n\r\nBlow after blow, the explosions resound and drive us in all directions\r\nas the bombardment mangles and devours the sanctuary of pierced and\r\ndiminished refuge. As the hissing flight of shells hammers and crushes\r\nthe gaping end of the cave with its thunderbolts, daylight streams in\r\nthrough the clefts. More sharply now, and more unnaturally, one sees\r\nthe flushed faces and those pallid with death, the eyes which fade in\r\nagony or burn with fever, the patched-up white-bound bodies, the\r\nmonstrous bandages. All that was hidden rises again into daylight.\r\nHaggard, blinking and distorted, in face of the flood of iron and\r\nembers that the hurricanes of light bring with them, the wounded arise\r\nand scatter and try to take flight. All the terror-struck inhabitants\r\nroll about in compact masses across the miserable tunnel, as if in the\r\npitching hold of a great ship that strikes the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe aviator, as upright as he can get and with his neck on the ceiling,\r\nwaves his arms and appeals to God, asks Him what He is called, what is\r\nHis real name. Overthrown by the blast and cast upon the others, I see\r\nhim who, bare of breast and his clothes gaping like a wound, reveals\r\nthe heart of a Christ. The greatcoat of the man who still monotonously\r\nrepeats, "What\'s the use of worrying?" now shows itself all green,\r\nbright green, the effect of the picric acid no doubt released by the\r\nexplosion that has staggered his brain. Others--the rest,\r\nindeed--helpless and maimed, move and creep and cringe, worm themselves\r\ninto the corners. They are like moles, poor, defenseless beasts, hunted\r\nby the hellish hounds of the guns.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment slackens, and ends in a cloud of smoke that still\r\nechoes the crashes, in a quivering and burning after-damp. I pass out\r\nthrough the breach; and still surrounded and entwined in the clamor of\r\ndespair, I arrive under the free sky, in the soft earth where mingled\r\nplanks and legs are sunk. I catch myself on some wreckage; it is the\r\nembankment of the trench. At the moment when I plunge into the\r\ncommunication trenches they are visible a long way; they are still\r\ngloomily stirring, still filled by the crowd that overflows from the\r\ntrenches and flows without end towards the refuges. For whole days, for\r\nwhole nights, you will see the long rolling streams of men plucked from\r\nthe fields of battle, from the plain over there that also has feelings\r\nof its own, though it bleeds and rots without end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nGoing About\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have been along the Boulevard de la Republique and then the Avenue\r\nGambetta, and now we are debouching into the Place du Commerce. The\r\nnails in our polished boots ring on the pavements of the capital. It is\r\nfine weather, and the shining sky glistens and flashes as if we saw it\r\nthrough the frames of a greenhouse; it sets a-sparkle all the\r\nshop-fronts in the square. The skirts of our well-brushed greatcoats\r\nhave been let down, and as they are usually fastened back, you can see\r\ntwo squares on the floating lappets where the cloth is bluer.\r\n\r\nOur sauntering party halts and hesitates for a moment in front of the\r\nCafe de la Sous-Prefecture, also called the Grand-Cafe.\r\n\r\n"We have the right to go in!" says Volpatte.\r\n\r\n"Too many officers in there," replies Blaire, who has lifted his chin\r\nover the guipure curtains in which the establishment is dressed up and\r\nrisked a glance through the window between its golden letters.\r\n\r\n"Besides," says Paradis, "we haven\'t seen enough yet."\r\n\r\nWe resume our walk and, simple soldiers that we are, we survey the\r\nsumptuous shops that encircle the Place du Commerce; the drapers, the\r\nstationers, the chemists, and--like a General\'s decorated uniform--the\r\ndisplay of the jeweler. We have put forth our smiles like ornaments,\r\nfor we are exempt from all duty until the evening, we are free, we are\r\nmasters of our own time. Our steps are gentle and sedate; our empty and\r\nswinging hands are also promenading, to and fro.\r\n\r\n"No doubt about it, you get some good out of this rest," remarks\r\nParadis.\r\n\r\nIt is an abundantly impressive city which expands before our steps. One\r\nis in touch with life, with the life of the people, the life of the\r\nRear, the normal life. How we used to think, down yonder, that we\r\nshould never get here!\r\n\r\nWe see gentlemen, ladies, English officers, aviators-recognizable afar\r\nby their slim elegance and their decorations--soldiers who are parading\r\ntheir scraped clothes and scrubbed skins and the solitary ornament of\r\ntheir engraved identity discs, flashing in the sunshine on their\r\ngreatcoats; and these last risk themselves carefully in the beautiful\r\nscene that is clear of all nightmares.\r\n\r\nWe make exclamations as they do who come from afar: "Talk about a\r\ncrowd!" says Tirette in wonder. "Ah, it\'s a wealthy town!" says Blaire.\r\n\r\nA work-girl passes and looks at us. Volpatte gives me a jog with his\r\nelbow and swallows her with his eyes, then points out to me two other\r\nwomen farther away who are coming up, and with beaming eye he certifies\r\nthat the town is rich in femininity--"Old man, they are plump!" A\r\nmoment ago Paradis had a certain timidity to overcome before he could\r\napproach a cluster of cakes of luxurious lodging, and touch and eat\r\nthem; and every minute we are obliged to halt in the middle of the\r\npavement and wait for Blaire, who is attracted and detained by the\r\ndisplays of fancy jumpers and caps, neck-ties in pale blue drill,\r\nslippers as red and shiny as mahogany. Blaire has reached the final\r\nheight of his transformation. He who held the record for negligence and\r\ngrime is certainly the best groomed of us all, especially since the\r\nfurther complication of his ivories, which were broken in the attack\r\nand had to be remade. He affects an off-hand demeanor. "He looks young\r\nand youthful," says Marthereau.\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves suddenly face to face with a toothless creature who\r\nsmiles to the depth of her throat. Some black hair bristles round her\r\nhat. Her big, unpleasant features, riddled with pock-marks, recalls the\r\nill-painted faces that one sees on the coarse canvas of a traveling\r\nshow. \'She\'s beautiful,\' says Volpatte. Marthereau, at whom she smiled,\r\nis dumb with shock.\r\n\r\nThus do the poilus converse who are suddenly placed under the spell of\r\na town. More and more they rejoice in the beautiful scene, so neat and\r\nincredibly clean. They resume possession of life tranquil and peaceful,\r\nof that conception of comfort and even of happiness for which in the\r\nmain houses were built.\r\n\r\n"We should easily get used to it again, you know, old man, after all!"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a crowd is gathered around an outfitter\'s shop-window where\r\nthe proprietor has contrived, with the aid of mannikins in wood and\r\nwax, a ridiculous tableau. On a groundwork of little pebbles like those\r\nin an aquarium, there is a kneeling German, in a suit so new that the\r\ncreases are definite, and punctuated with an Iron Cross in cardboard.\r\nHe holds up his two wooden pink hands to a French officer, whose curly\r\nwig makes a cushion for a juvenile cap, who has bulging, crimson\r\ncheeks, and whose infantile eye of adamant looks somewhere else. Beside\r\nthe two personages lies a rifle barrowed from the odd trophies of a\r\nbox of toys. A card gives the title of the animated group--"Kamarad!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, damn it, look!"\r\n\r\nWe shrug our shoulders at sight of the puerile contrivance, the only\r\nthing here that recalls to us the gigantic war raging somewhere under\r\nthe sky. We begin to laugh bitterly, offended and even wounded to the\r\nquick in our new impressions. Tirette collects himself, and some\r\nabusive sarcasm rises to his lips; but the protest lingers and is mute\r\nby reason of our total transportation, the amazement of being somewhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nOur group is then espied by a very stylish and rustling lady, radiant\r\nin violet and black silk and enveloped in perfumes. She puts out her\r\nlittle gloved hand and touches Volpatte\'s sleeve and then Blaire\'s\r\nshoulder, and they instantly halt, gorgonized by this direct contact\r\nwith the fairy-like being.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, messieurs, you who are real soldiers from the front, you have\r\nseen that in the trenches, haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Er--yes--yes," reply the two poor fellows, horribly frightened and\r\ngloriously gratified.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" the crowd murmurs, "did you hear? And they\'ve been there, they\r\nhave!"\r\n\r\nWhen we find ourselves alone again on the flagged perfection of the\r\npavement, Volpatte and Blaire look at each other and shake their heads.\r\n\r\n"After all," says Volpatte, "it is pretty much like that you know!"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, of course!"\r\n\r\nAnd these were their first words of false swearing that day.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWe go into the Cafe de l\'Industrie et des Fleurs. A roadway of matting\r\nclothes the middle of the floor. Painted all the way along the walls,\r\nall the way up the square pillars that support the roof, and on the\r\nfront of the counter, there is purple convolvulus among great scarlet\r\npoppies and roses like red cabbages.\r\n\r\n"No doubt about it, we\'ve got good taste in France," says Tirette.\r\n\r\n"The chap that did all that had a cartload of patience," Blaire\r\ndeclares as he looks at the rainbow embellishments.\r\n\r\n"In these places," Volpatte adds, "the pleasure of drinking isn\'t the\r\nonly one."\r\n\r\nParadis informs us that he knows all about cafes. On Sundays formerly,\r\nhe frequented cafes as beautiful as this one and even more beautiful.\r\nOnly, he explains, that was a long time ago, and he has lost the flavor\r\nthat they\'ve got. He indicates a little enameled wash-hand basin\r\nhanging on the wall and decorated with flowers: "There\'s where one can\r\nwash his hands." We steer politely towards the basin. Volpatte signs to\r\nParadis to turn the tap, and says, "Set the waterworks going!"\r\n\r\nThen all six of us enter the saloon, whose circumference is already\r\nadorned with customers, and install ourselves at a table.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have six currant-vermouths, shall we?"\r\n\r\n"We could very easily get used to it again, after all," they repeat.\r\n\r\nSome civilians leave their places and come near us. They whisper,\r\n"They\'ve all got the Croix de Guerre, Adolphe, you see---"--"Those are\r\nreal poilus!"\r\n\r\nOur comrades overhear, and now they only talk among themselves\r\nabstractedly, with their ears elsewhere, and an unconscious air of\r\nimportance appears.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the man and woman from whom the remarks proceeded lean\r\ntowards us with their elbows on the white marble and question us: "Life\r\nin the trenches, it\'s very rough, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Er--yes--well, of course, it isn\'t always pleasant."\r\n\r\n"What splendid physical and moral endurance you have! In the end you\r\nget used to the life, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, of course, one gets used to it--one gets used to it all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"All the same, it\'s a terrible existence--and the suffering!" murmurs\r\nthe lady, turning over the leaves of an illustrated paper which\r\ndisplays gloomy pictures of destruction. "They ought not to publish\r\nthese things, Adolphe, about the dirt and the vermin and the fatigues!\r\nBrave as you are, you must be unhappy?"\r\n\r\nVolpatte, to whom she speaks, blushes. He is ashamed of the misery\r\nwhence he comes, whither he must return. He lowers his head and lies,\r\nperhaps without realizing the extent of his mendacity: "No, after all,\r\nwe\'re not unhappy, it isn\'t so terrible as all that!"\r\n\r\nThe lady is of the same opinion. "I know," she says, "there are\r\ncompensations! How superb a charge must be, eh? All those masses of men\r\nadvancing like they do in a holiday procession, and the trumpets\r\nplaying a rousing air in the fields! And the dear little soldiers that\r\ncan\'t be held back and shouting, \'Vive la France!\' and even laughing as\r\nthey die! Ah! we others, we\'re not in honor\'s way like you are. My\r\nhusband is a clerk at the Prefecture, and just now he\'s got a holiday\r\nto treat his rheumatism."\r\n\r\n"I should very much have liked to be a soldier," said the gentleman,\r\n"but I\'ve no luck. The head of my office can\'t get on without me."\r\n\r\nPeople go and come, elbowing and disappearing behind each other. The\r\nwaiters worm their way through with their fragile and sparkling\r\nburdens--green, red or bright yellow, with a white border. The grating\r\nof feet on the sanded floor mingles with the exclamations of the\r\nregular customers as they recognize each other, some standing, others\r\nleaning on their elbows, amid the sound of glasses and dominoes pushed\r\nalong the tables. In the background, around the seductive shock of\r\nivory balls, a crowding circle of spectators emits classical\r\npleasantries.\r\n\r\n"Every man to his trade, mon brave," says a man at the other end of the\r\ntable whose face is adorned with powerful colors, addressing Tirette\r\ndirectly; "you are heroes. On our side, we are working in the economic\r\nlife of the country. It is a struggle like yours. I am useful--I don\'t\r\nsay more useful than you, but equally so."\r\n\r\nAnd I see Tirette through the cigar-smoke making round eyes, and in the\r\nhubbub I can hardly hear the reply of his humble and dumbfounded\r\nvoice--Tirette, the funny man of the squad!--"Yes, that\'s true; every\r\nman to his trade."\r\n\r\nFurtively we stole away.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWe are almost silent as we leave the Cafe des Fleurs. It seems as if we\r\nno longer know how to talk. Something like discontent irritates my\r\ncomrades and knits their brows. They look as if they are becoming aware\r\nthat they have not done their duty at an important juncture.\r\n\r\n"Fine lot of gibberish they\'ve talked to us, the beasts!" Tirette\r\ngrowls at last with a rancor that gathers strength the more we unite\r\nand collect ourselves again.\r\n\r\n"We ought to have got beastly drunk to-day!" replies Paradis brutally.\r\n\r\nWe walk without a word spoken. Then, after a time, "They\'re a lot of\r\nidiots, filthy idiots," Tirette goes on; "they tried to cod us, but I\'m\r\nnot on; if I see them again," he says, with a crescendo of anger, "I\r\nshall know what to say to them!"\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t see them again," says Blaire.\r\n\r\n"In eight days from now, p\'raps we shall be laid out," says Volpatte.\r\n\r\nIn the approaches to the square we run into a mob of people flowing out\r\nfrom the Hotel de Ville and from another big public building which\r\ndisplays the columns of a temple supporting a pediment. Offices are\r\nclosing, and pouring forth civilians of all sorts and all ages, and\r\nmilitary men both young and old, who seem at a distance to be dressed\r\npretty much like us; but when nearer they stand revealed as the\r\nshirkers and deserters of the war, in spite of being disguised as\r\nsoldiers, in spite of their brisques. [note 1]\r\n\r\nWomen and children are waiting for them, in pretty and happy clusters.\r\nThe commercial people are shutting up their shops with complacent\r\ncontent and a smile for both the day ended and for the morrow, elated\r\nby the lively and constant thrills of profits increased, by the growing\r\njingle of the cash-box. They have stayed behind in the heart of their\r\nown firesides; they have only to stoop to caress their children. We see\r\nthem beaming in the first starlights of the street, all these rich folk\r\nwho are becoming richer, all these tranquil people whose tranquillity\r\nincreases every day, people who are full, you feel, and in spite of\r\nall, of an unconfessable prayer. They all go slowly, by grace of the\r\nfine evening, and settle themselves in perfected homes, or in cafes\r\nwhere they are waited upon. Couples are forming, too, young women and\r\nyoung men, civilians or soldiers, with some badge of their preservation\r\nembroidered on their collars. They make haste into the shadows of\r\nsecurity where the others go, where the dawn of lighted rooms awaits\r\nthem; they hurry towards the night of rest and caresses.\r\n\r\nAnd as we pass quite close to a ground-floor window which is half open,\r\nwe see the breeze gently inflate the lace curtain and lend it the light\r\nand delicious form of lingerie--and the advancing throng drives us\r\nback, poor strangers that we are!\r\n\r\nWe wander along the pavement, all through the twilight that begins to\r\nglow with gold--for in towns Night adorns herself with jewels. The\r\nsight of this world has revealed a great truth to us at last, nor could\r\nwe avoid it: a Difference which becomes evident between human beings, a\r\nDifference far deeper than that of nations and with defensive trenches\r\nmore impregnable; the clean-cut and truly unpardonable division that\r\nthere is in a country\'s inhabitants between those who gain and those\r\nwho grieve, those who are required to sacrifice all, all, to give their\r\nnumbers and strength and suffering to the last limit, those upon whom\r\nthe others walk and advance, smile and succeed.\r\n\r\nSome items of mourning attire make blots in the crowd and have their\r\nmessage for us, but the rest is of merriment, not mourning.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t one single country, that\'s not possible," suddenly says\r\nVolpatte with singular precision, "there are two. We\'re divided into\r\ntwo foreign countries. The Front, over there, where there are too many\r\nunhappy, and the Rear, here, where there are too many happy."\r\n\r\n"How can you help it? It serves its end--it\'s the background--but\r\nafterwards--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; but all the same, all the same, there are too many of\r\nthem, and they\'re too happy, and they\'re always the same ones, and\r\nthere\'s no reason--"\r\n\r\n"What can you do?" says Tirette.\r\n\r\n"So much the worse," adds Blaire, still more simply.\r\n\r\n"In eight days from now p\'raps we shall have snuffed it!" Volpatte is\r\ncontent to repeat as we go away with lowered heads.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[note 1] See p. 117.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nThe Fatigue-Party\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENING is falling upon the trench. All through the day it has been\r\ndrawing near, invisible as fate, and now it encroaches on the banks of\r\nthe long ditches like the lips of a wound infinitely great.\r\n\r\nWe have talked, eaten, slept, and written in the bottom of the trench\r\nsince the morning. Now that evening is here, an eddying springs up in\r\nthe boundless crevice; it stirs and unifies the torpid disorder of the\r\nscattered men. It is the hour when we arise and work.\r\n\r\nVolpatte and Tirette approach each other. "Another day gone by, another\r\nlike the rest of \'em," says Volpatte, looking at the darkening sky.\r\n\r\n"You\'re off it; our day isn\'t finished," replies Tirette, whose long\r\nexperience of calamity has taught him that one must not jump to\r\nconclusions, where we are, even in regard to the modest future of a\r\ncommonplace evening that has already begun.\r\n\r\n"Allons! Muster!" We join up with the laggard inattention of custom.\r\nWith himself each man brings his rifle, his pouches of cartridges, his\r\nwater-bottle, and a pouch that contains a lump of bread. Volpatte is\r\nstill eating, with protruding and palpitating cheek. Paradis, with\r\npurple nose and chattering teeth, growls. Fouillade trails his rifle\r\nalong like a broom. Marthereau looks at a mournful handkerchief,\r\nrumpled and stiff, and puts it back in his pocket. A cold drizzle is\r\nfalling, and everybody shivers.\r\n\r\nDown yonder we hear a droning chant--"Two shovels, one pick, two\r\nshovels, one pick----" The file trickles along to the tool-store,\r\nstagnates at the door, and departs, bristling with implements.\r\n\r\n"Everybody here? Gee up!" says the sergeant. Downward and rolling, we\r\ngo forward. We know not where we go. We know nothing, except that the\r\nnight and the earth are blending in the same abyss.\r\n\r\nAs we emerge into the nude twilight from the trench, we see it already\r\nblack as the crater of a dead volcano. Great gray clouds,\r\nstorm-charged, hang from the sky. The plain, too, is gray in the pallid\r\nlight; the grass is muddy, and all slashed with water. The things which\r\nhere and there seem only distorted limbs are denuded trees. We cannot\r\nsee far around us in the damp reek; besides, we only look downwards at\r\nthe mud in which we slide--"Porridge!"\r\n\r\nGoing across country we knead and pound a sticky paste which spreads\r\nout and flows back from every step--"Chocolate cream--coffee creams!"\r\n\r\nOn the stony parts, the wiped-out ruins of roads that have become\r\nbarren as the fields, the marching troop breaks through a layer of\r\nslime into a flinty conglomerate that grates and gives way under our\r\niron-shod soles--"Seems as if we were walking on buttered toast!"\r\n\r\nOn the slope of a knoll sometimes, the mud is black and thick and\r\ndeep-rutted, like that which forms around the horse-ponds in villages,\r\nand in these ruts there are lakes and puddles and ponds, whose edges\r\nseem to be in rags.\r\n\r\nThe pleasantries of the wags, who in the early freshness of the journey\r\nhad cried, "Quack, quack," when they went through the water, are now\r\nbecoming rare and gloomy; gradually the jokers are damped down. The\r\nrain begins to fall heavily. The daylight dwindles, and the confusion\r\nthat is space contracts. The last lingering light welters on the ground\r\nand in the water.\r\n\r\nA steaming silhouette of men like monks appears through the rain in the\r\nwest. It is a company of the 204th, wrapped in tent-cloths. As we go by\r\nwe see the pale and shrunken faces and the dark noses of these dripping\r\nprowlers before they disappear. The track we are following through the\r\nfaint grass of the fields is itself a sticky field streaked with\r\ncountless parallel ruts, all plowed in the same line by the feet and\r\nthe wheels of those who go to the front and those who go to the rear.\r\n\r\nWe have to jump over gaping trenches, and this is not always easy, for\r\nthe edges have become soft and slippery, and earth-falls have widened\r\nthem. Fatigue, too, begins to bear upon our shoulders. Vehicles cross\r\nour path with a great noise and splashing. Artillery limbers prance by\r\nand spray us heavily. The motor lorries are borne on whirling circles\r\nof water around the wheels, with spirting tumultuous spokes.\r\n\r\nAs the darkness increases, the jolted vehicles and the horses\' necks\r\nand the profiles of the riders with their floating cloaks and slung\r\ncarbines stand out still more fantastically against the misty floods\r\nfrom the sky. Here, there is a block of ammunition carts of the\r\nartillery. The horses are standing and trampling as we go by. We hear\r\nthe creaking of axles, shouts, disputes, commands which collide, and\r\nthe roar of the ocean of rain. Over the confused scuffle we can see\r\nsteam rising from the buttocks of the teams and the cloaks of the\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\n"Look out!" Something is laid out on the ground on our right--a row of\r\ndead. As we go by, our feet instinctively avoid them and our eyes\r\nsearch them. We see upright boot-soles, outstretched necks, the hollows\r\nof uncertain faces, hands half clenched in the air over the dark medley.\r\n\r\nWe march and march, over fields still ghostly and foot-worn, under a\r\nsky where ragged clouds unfurl themselves upon the blackening\r\nexpanse--which seems to have befouled itself by prolonged contact with\r\nso many multitudes of sorry humanity.\r\n\r\nThen we go down again into the communication trenches. To reach them we\r\nmake a wide circuit, so that the rearguard can see the whole company, a\r\nhundred yards away, deployed in the gloom, little obscure figures\r\nsticking to the slopes and following each other in loose order, with\r\ntheir tools amid their rifles pricking up on each side of their heads,\r\na slender trivial line that plunges in and raises its arms as if in\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\nThese trenches--still of the second lines--are populous. On the\r\nthresholds of the dug-outs, where cart-cloths and skins of animals hang\r\nand flap, squatting and bearded men watch our passing with\r\nexpressionless eyes, as if they were looking at nothing. From beneath\r\nother cloths, drawn down to the ground, feet are projected, and snores.\r\n\r\n"Nom de Dieu! It\'s a long way!" the trampers begin to grumble. There is\r\nan eddy and recoil in the flow.\r\n\r\n"Halt!" The stop is to let others go by. We pile ourselves up, cursing,\r\non the walls of the trench. It is a company of machine-gunners with\r\ntheir curious burdens.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no end to it, and the long halts are wearying.\r\nMuscles are beginning to stretch. The everlasting march is overwhelming\r\nus. We have hardly got going again when we have to recoil once more\r\ninto a traverse to let the relief of the telephonists go by. We back\r\nlike awkward cattle, and restart more heavily.\r\n\r\n"Look out for the wire!" The telephone wire undulates above the trench,\r\nand crosses it in places between two posts. When it is too slack, its\r\ncurve sags into the trench and catches the rifles of passing men, and\r\nthe ensnared ones struggle, and abuse the engineers who don\'t know how\r\nto fix up their threads.\r\n\r\nThen, as the drooping entanglement of precious wires increases, we\r\nshoulder our rifles with the butt in the air, carry the shovels under\r\nour arms, and go forward with lowered heads.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nOur progress now is suddenly checked, and we only advance step by step,\r\nlocked in each other. The head of the column must be in difficult case.\r\nWe reach a spot where failing ground leads to a yawning hole--the\r\nCovered Trench. The others have disappeared through the low doorway.\r\n"We\'ve got to go into this blackpudding, then?"\r\n\r\nEvery man hesitates before ingulfing himself in the narrow underground\r\ndarkness, and it is the total of these hesitations and lingerings that\r\nis reflected in the rear sections of the column in the form of\r\nwavering, obstruction, and sometimes abrupt shocks.\r\n\r\nFrom our first steps in the Covered Trench, a heavy darkness settles on\r\nus and divides us from each other. The damp odor of a swamped cave\r\nsteals into us. In the ceiling of the earthen corridor that contains\r\nus, we can make out a few streaks and holes of pallor--the chinks and\r\nrents in the overhead planks. Little streams of water flow freely\r\nthrough them in places, and in spite of tentative groping we stumble on\r\nheaped-up timber. Alongside, our knocks discover the dim vertical\r\npresence of the supporting beams.\r\n\r\nThe air in this interminable tunnel is vibrating heavily. It is the\r\nsearchlight engine that is installed there--we have to pass in front of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter we have felt our deep-drowned way for a quarter of an hour, some\r\none who is overborne by the darkness and the wet, and tired of bumping\r\ninto unknown people, growls, "I don\'t care--I\'m going to light up."\r\n\r\nThe brilliant beam of a little electric lamp flashes out, and instantly\r\nthe sergeant bellows, "Ye gods! Who\'s the complete ass that\'s making a\r\nlight? Are you daft? Don\'t you know it can be seen, you scab, through\r\nthe roof?"\r\n\r\nThe flash-lamp, after revealing some dark and oozing walls in its cone\r\nof light, retires into the night. "Not much you can\'t see it!" jeers\r\nthe man, "and anyway we\'re not in the first lines." "Ah, that can\'t be\r\nseen!"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, wedged into the file and continuing to advance, appears\r\nto be turning round as he goes and attempting some forceful\r\nobservations--"You gallows-bird! You damned dodger!" But suddenly he\r\nstarts a new roar--"What! Another man smoking now! Holy hell!" This\r\ntime he tries to halt, but in vain he rears himself against the wall\r\nand struggles to stick to it. He is forced precipitately to go with the\r\nstream and is carried away among his own shouts, which return and\r\nswallow him up, while the cigarette, the cause of his rage, disappears\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe jerky beat of the engine grows louder, and an increasing heat\r\nsurrounds us. The overcharged air of the trench vibrates more and more\r\nas we go forward. The engine\'s jarring note soon hammers our ears and\r\nshakes us through. Still it gets hotter; it is like some great animal\r\nbreathing in our faces. The buried trench seems to be leading us down\r\nand down into the tumult of some infernal workshop, whose dark-red glow\r\nis sketching out our huge and curving shadows in purple on the walls.\r\n\r\nIn a diabolical crescendo of din, of hot wind and of lights, we flow\r\ndeafened towards the furnace. One would think that the engine itself\r\nwas hurling itself through the tunnel to meet us, like a frantic\r\nmotor-cyclist drawing dizzily near with his headlight and destruction.\r\n\r\nScorched and half blinded, we pass in front of the red furnace and the\r\nblack engine, whose flywheel roars like a hurricane, and we have hardly\r\ntime to make out the movements of men around it. We shut our eyes,\r\nchoked by the contact of this glaring white-hot breath.\r\n\r\nNow, the noise and the heat are raging behind us and growing feebler,\r\nand my neighbor mutters in his beard, "And that idiot that said my lamp\r\nwould be seen!"\r\n\r\nAnd here is the free air! The sky is a very dark blue, of the same\r\ncolor as the earth and little lighter. The rain becomes worse and\r\nworse, and walking is laborious in the heavy slime. The whole boot\r\nsinks in, and it is a labor of acute pain to withdraw the foot every\r\ntime. Hardly anything is left visible in the night, but at the exit\r\nfrom the hole we see a disorder of beams which flounder in the widened\r\ntrench--some demolished dugout.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, a searchlight\'s unearthly arm that was swinging\r\nthrough space stops and falls on us, and we find that the tangle of\r\nuprooted and sunken posts and shattered framing is populous with dead\r\nsoldiers. Quite close to me, the head of a kneeling body hangs on its\r\nback by an uncertain thread; a black veneer, edged with clotted drops,\r\ncovers the cheek. Another body so clasps a post in its arms that it has\r\nonly half fallen. Another, lying in the form of a circle, has been\r\nstripped by the shell, and his back and belly are laid bare. Another,\r\noutstretched on the edge of the heap, has thrown his hand across our\r\npath; and in this place where there no traffic except by night--for the\r\ntrench is blocked just there by the earth-fall and inaccessible by\r\nday--every one treads on that hand. By the searchlight\'s shaft I saw it\r\nclearly, fleshless and worn, a sort of withered fin.\r\n\r\nThe rain is raging and the sound of its streaming dominates\r\neverything--a horror of desolation. We feel the water on our flesh as\r\nif the deluge had washed our clothes away.\r\n\r\nWe enter the open trench, and the embrace of night and storm resumes\r\nthe sole possession of this confusion of corpses, stranded and cramped\r\non a square of earth as on a raft.\r\n\r\nThe wind freezes the drops of sweat on our foreheads. It is near\r\nmidnight. For six hours now we have marched in the increasing burden of\r\nthe mud. This is the time when the Paris theaters are constellated with\r\nelectroliers and blossoming with lamps; when they are filled with\r\nluxurious excitement, with the rustle of skirts, with merrymaking and\r\nwarmth; when a fragrant and radiant multitude, chatting, laughing,\r\nsmiling, applauding, expanding, feels itself pleasantly affected by the\r\ncleverly graduated emotions which the comedy evokes, and lolls in\r\ncontented enjoyment of the rich and splendid pageants of military\r\nglorification that crowd the stage of the music-hall.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t we there? Nom de Dieu, shan\'t we ever get there?" The groan is\r\nbreathed by the long procession that tosses about in these crevices of\r\nthe earth, carrying rifles and shovels and pickaxes under the eternal\r\ntorrent. We march and march. We are drunk with fatigue, and roll to\r\nthis side and that. Stupefied and soaked, we strike with our shoulders\r\na substance as sodden as ourselves.\r\n\r\n"Halt!"--"Are we there?"--"Ah, yes, we\'re there!"\r\n\r\nFor the moment a heavy recoil presses us back and then a murmur runs\r\nalong: "We\'ve lost ourselves." The truth dawns on the confusion of the\r\nwandering horde. We have taken the wrong turn at some fork, and it will\r\nbe the deuce of a job to find the right way again.\r\n\r\nThen, too, a rumor passes from mouth to mouth that a fighting company\r\non its way to the lines is coming up behind us. The way by which we\r\nhave come is stopped up with men. It is the block absolute.\r\n\r\nAt all costs we must try to regain the lost trench--which is alleged to\r\nbe on our left--by trickling through some sap or other. Utterly wearied\r\nand unnerved, the men break into gesticulations and violent reproaches.\r\nThey trudge awhile, then drop their tools and halt. Here and there are\r\ncompact groups--you can glimpse them by the light of the\r\nstar-shells--who have let themselves fall to the ground. Scattered afar\r\nfrom south to north, the troop waits in the merciless rain.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant who is in charge and has led us astray, wriggles his way\r\nalong the men in quest of some lateral exit. A little trench appears,\r\nshallow and narrow.\r\n\r\n"We must go that way, no doubt about it," the officer hastens to say.\r\n"Come, forward, boys."\r\n\r\nEach man sulkily picks up his burden. But a chorus of oaths and curses\r\nrises from the first who enter the little sap: "It\'s a latrine!"\r\n\r\nA disgusting smell escapes from the trench, and those inside halt butt\r\ninto each other, and refuse to advance. We are all jammed against each\r\nother and block up the threshold.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather climb out and go in the open!" cries a man. But there are\r\nflashes rending the sky above the embankments on all sides, and the\r\nsight is so fearsome of these jets of resounding flame that overhang\r\nour pit and its swarming shadows that no one responds to the madman\'s\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nWilling or unwilling, since we cannot go back, we must even take that\r\nway. "Forward into the filth!" cries the leader of the troop. We plunge\r\nin, tense with repulsion. Bullets are whistling over. "Lower your\r\nheads!" The trench has little depth; one must stoop very low to avoid\r\nbeing hit, and the stench becomes intolerable. At last we emerge into\r\nthe communication trench that we left in error. We begin again to\r\nmarch. Though we march without end we arrive nowhere.\r\n\r\nWhile we wander on, dumb and vacant, in the dizzy stupefaction of\r\nfatigue, the stream which is running in the bottom of the trench\r\ncleanses our befouled feet.\r\n\r\nThe roars of the artillery succeed each other faster and faster, till\r\nthey make but a single roar upon all the earth. From all sides the\r\ngunfire and the bursting shells hurl their swift shafts of light and\r\nstripe confusedly the black sky over our heads. The bombardment then\r\nbecomes so intense that its illumination has no break. In the\r\ncontinuous chain of thunderbolts we can see each other clearly--our\r\nhelmets streaming like the bodies of fishes, our sodden leathers, the\r\nshovel-blades black and glistening; we can even see the pale drops of\r\nthe unending rain. Never have I seen the like of it; in very truth it\r\nis moonlight made by gunfire.\r\n\r\nTogether there mounts from our lines and from the enemy\'s such a cloud\r\nof rockets that they unite and mingle in constellations; at one moment,\r\nto light us on our hideous way, there was a Great Bear of star-shells\r\nin the valley of the sky that we could see between the parapets.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWe are lost again, and this time we must be close to the first lines;\r\nbut a depression in this part of the plain forms a sort of basin,\r\noverrun by shadows. We have marched along a sap and then back again. In\r\nthe phosphorescent vibration of the guns, shimmering like a\r\ncinematograph, we make out above the parapet two stretcher-bearers\r\ntrying to cross the trench with their laden stretcher.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, who at least knows the place where he should guide the\r\nteam of workers, questions them, "Where is the New Trench?"--"Don\'t\r\nknow." From the ranks another question is put to them, "How far are we\r\nfrom the Boches?" They make no reply, as they are talking among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"I\'m stopping," says the man in front; "I\'m too tired."\r\n\r\n"Come, get on with you, nom de Dieu!" says the other in a surly tone\r\nand floundering heavily, his arms extended by the stretcher. "We can\'t\r\nstop and rust here."\r\n\r\nThey put the stretcher down on the parapet, the edge of it overhanging\r\nthe trench, and as we pass underneath we can see the prostrate man\'s\r\nfeet. The rain which falls on the stretcher drains from it darkened.\r\n\r\n"Wounded?" some one asks down below.\r\n\r\n"No, a stiff," growls the bearer this time, "and he weighs twelve stone\r\nat least. Wounded I don\'t mind--for two days and two nights we haven\'t\r\nleft off carrying \'em--but it\'s rotten, breaking yourself up with\r\nlugging dead men about." And the bearer, upright on the edge of the\r\nbank, drops a foot to the base of the opposite bank across the cavity,\r\nand with his legs wide apart, laboriously balanced, he grips the\r\nstretcher and begins to draw it across, calling on his companion to\r\nhelp him.\r\n\r\nA little farther we see the stooping form of a hooded officer, and as\r\nhe raises his hand to his face we see two gold lines on his sleeve. He,\r\nsurely, will tell us the way. But he addresses us, and asks if we have\r\nnot seen the battery he is looking for. We shall never get there!\r\n\r\nBut we do, all the same. We finish up in a field of blackness where a\r\nfew lean posts are bristling. We climb up to it, and spread out in\r\nsilence. This is the spot.\r\n\r\nThe placing of us is an undertaking. Four separate times we go forward\r\nand then retire, before the company is regularly echeloned along the\r\nlength of the trench to be dug, before an equal interval is left\r\nbetween each team of one striker and two shovelers. "Incline three\r\npaces more--too much--one pace to the rear. Come, one pace to the\r\nrear--are you deaf?--Halt! There!"\r\n\r\nThis adjustment is done by the lieutenant and a noncom. of the\r\nEngineers who has sprung up out of the ground. Together or separately\r\nthey run along the file and give their muttered orders into the men\'s\r\nears as they take them by the arm, sometimes, to guide them. Though\r\nbegun in an orderly way, the arrangement degenerates, thanks to the ill\r\ntemper of the exhausted men, who must continually be uprooting\r\nthemselves from the spot where the undulating mob is stranded.\r\n\r\n"We\'re in front of the first lines," they whisper round me. "No."\r\nmurmur other voices, "we\'re just behind."\r\n\r\nNo one knows. The rain still falls, though less fiercely than at some\r\nmoments on the march. But what matters the rain! We have spread\r\nourselves out on the ground. Now that our backs and limbs rest in the\r\nyielding mud, we are so comfortable that we are unconcerned about the\r\nrain that pricks our faces and drives through to our flesh, indifferent\r\nto the saturation of the bed that contains us.\r\n\r\nBut we get hardly time enough to draw breath. They are not so imprudent\r\nas to let us bury ourselves in sleep. We must set ourselves to\r\nincessant labor. It is two o\'clock of the morning; in four hours more\r\nit will be too light for us to stay here. There is not a minute to lose.\r\n\r\n"Every man," they say to us, "must dig five feet in length, two and a\r\nhalf feet in width, and two and three-quarter feet in depth. That makes\r\nfifteen feet in length for each team. And I advise you to get into it;\r\nthe sooner it\'s done, the sooner you\'ll leave."\r\n\r\nWe know the pious claptrap. It is not recorded in the annals of the\r\nregiment that a trenching fatigue-party ever once got away before the\r\nmoment when it became absolutely necessary to quit the neighborhood if\r\nthey were not to be seen, marked and destroyed along with the work of\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nWe murmur, "Yes, yes--all right; it\'s not worth saying. Go easy."\r\n\r\nBut everybody applies himself to the job courageously, except for some\r\ninvincible sleepers whose nap will involve them later in superhuman\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nWe attack the first layer of the new line--little mounds of earth,\r\nstringy with grass. The ease and speed with which the work begins--like\r\nall entrenching work in free soil--foster the illusion that it will\r\nsoon be finished, that we shall be able to sleep in the cavities we\r\nhave scooped: and thus a certain eagerness revives.\r\n\r\nBut whether by reason of the noise of the shovels, or because some men\r\nare chatting almost aloud, in spite of reproofs, our activity wakes up\r\na rocket, whose flaming vertical line rattles suddenly on our right.\r\n\r\n"Lie down!" Every man flattens himself, and the rocket balances and\r\nparades its huge pallor over a sort of field of the dead.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is out one hears the men, in places and then all along,\r\ndetach themselves from their secretive stillness, get up, and resume\r\nthe task with more discretion.\r\n\r\nSoon another star-shell tosses aloft its long golden stalk, and still\r\nmore brightly illuminates the flat and motionless line of trenchmakers.\r\nThen another and another.\r\n\r\nBullets rend the air around us, and we hear a cry, "Some one wounded!"\r\nHe passes, supported by comrades. We can just see the group of men who\r\nare going away, dragging one of their number.\r\n\r\nThe place becomes unwholesome. We stoop and crouch, and some are\r\nscratching at the earth on their knees. Others are working full length;\r\nthey toil, and turn, and turn again, like men in nightmares. The earth,\r\nwhose first layer was light to lift, becomes muddy and sticky; it is\r\nhard to handle, and clings to the tool like glue. After every shovelful\r\nthe blade must be scraped.\r\n\r\nAlready a thin heap of earth is winding along, and each man has the\r\nidea of reinforcing the incipient breastwork with his pouch and his\r\nrolled-up greatcoat, and he hoods himself behind the slender pile of\r\nshadow when a volley comes--\r\n\r\nWhile we work we sweat, and as soon as we stop working we are pierced\r\nthrough by the cold. A spell seems to be cast on us, paralyzing our\r\narms. The rockets torment and pursue us, and allow us but little\r\nmovement. After every one of them that petrifies us with its light we\r\nhave to struggle against a task still more stubborn. The hole only\r\ndeepens into the darkness with painful and despairing tardiness.\r\n\r\nThe ground gets softer; each shovelful drips and flows, and spreads\r\nfrom the blade with a flabby sound. At last some one cries, "Water!"\r\nThe repeated cry travels all along the row of diggers--"Water--that\'s\r\ndone it!"\r\n\r\n"Melusson\'s team\'s dug deeper, and there\'s water. They\'ve struck a\r\nswamp."--"No help for it."\r\n\r\nWe stop in confusion. In the bosom of the night we hear the sound of\r\nshovels and picks thrown down like empty weapons. The non-coms. go\r\ngropingly after the officer to get instructions. Here and there, with\r\nno desire for anything better, some men are going deliciously to sleep\r\nunder the caress of the rain, under the radiant rockets.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIt was very nearly at this minute, as far as I can remember, that the\r\nbombardment began again. The first shell fell with a terrible splitting\r\nof the air, which seemed to tear itself in two; and other whistles were\r\nalready converging upon us when its explosion uplifted the ground at\r\nthe head of the detachment in the heart of the magnitude of night and\r\nrain, revealing gesticulations upon a sudden screen of red.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they had seen us, thanks to the rockets, and had trained their\r\nfire on us.\r\n\r\nThe men hurled and rolled themselves towards the little flooded ditch\r\nthat they had dug, wedging, burying, and immersing themselves in it,\r\nand placed the blades of the shovels over their heads. To right, to\r\nleft, in front and behind, shells burst so near that every one of them\r\nshook us in our bed of clay; and it became soon one continuous quaking\r\nthat seized the wretched gutter, crowded with men and scaly with\r\nshovels, under the strata of smoke and the falling fire. The splinters\r\nand debris crossed in all directions with a network of noise over the\r\ndazzling field. No second passed but we all thought what some stammered\r\nwith their faces in the earth, "We\'re done, this time!"\r\n\r\nA little in front of the place where I am, a shape has arisen and\r\ncried, "Let\'s be off!" Prone bodies half rose out of the shroud of mud\r\nthat dripped in tails and liquid rags from their limbs, and these\r\ndeathful apparitions cried also, "Let\'s go!" They were on their knees,\r\non all-fours, crawling towards the way of retreat: "Get on, allez, get\r\non!"\r\n\r\nBut the long file stayed motionless, and the frenzied complaints were\r\nin vain. They who were down there at the end would not budge, and their\r\ninactivity immobilized the rest. Some wounded passed over the others,\r\ncrawling over them as over debris, and sprinkling the whole company\r\nwith their blood.\r\n\r\nWe discovered at last the cause of the maddening inactivity of the\r\ndetachment\'s tail--"There\'s a barrage fire beyond."\r\n\r\nA weird imprisoned panic seized upon the men with cries inarticulate\r\nand gestures stillborn. They writhed upon the spot. But little shelter\r\nas the incipient trench afforded, no one dared leave the ditch that\r\nsaved us from protruding above the level of the ground, no one dared\r\nfly from death towards the traverse that should be down there. Great\r\nwere the risks of the wounded who had managed to crawl over the others,\r\nand every moment some were struck and went down again.\r\n\r\nFire and water fell blended everywhere. Profoundly entangled in the\r\nsupernatural din, we shook from neck to heels. The most hideous of\r\ndeaths was falling and bounding and plunging all around us in waves of\r\nlight, its crashing snatched our fearfulness in all directions--our\r\nflesh prepared itself for the monstrous sacrifice! In that tense moment\r\nof imminent destruction, we could only remember just then how often we\r\nhad already experienced it, how often undergone this outpouring of\r\niron, and the burning roar of it, and the stench. It is only during a\r\nbombardment that one really recalls those he has already endured.\r\n\r\nAnd still, without ceasing, newly-wounded men crept over us, fleeing at\r\nany price. In the fear that their contact evoked we groaned again, "We\r\nshan\'t get out of this; nobody will get out of it."\r\n\r\nSuddenly a gap appeared in the compressed humanity, and those behind\r\nbreathed again, for we were on the move.\r\n\r\nWe began by crawling, then we ran, bowed low in the mud and water that\r\nmirrored the flashes and the crimson gleams, stumbling and falling over\r\nsubmerged obstructions, ourselves resembling heavy splashing\r\nprojectiles, thunder-hurled along the ground. We arrive at the\r\nstarting-place of the trench we had begun to dig.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no trench--there\'s nothing."\r\n\r\nIn truth the eye could discern no shelter in the plain where our work\r\nhad begun. Even by the stormy flash of the rockets we could only see\r\nthe plain, a huge and raging desert. The trench could not be far away,\r\nfor it had brought us here. But which way must we steer to find it?\r\n\r\nThe rain redoubled. We lingered a moment in mournful disappointment,\r\ngathered on a lightning-smitten and unknown shore--and then the\r\nstampede.\r\n\r\nSome bore to the left, some to the right, some went straight\r\nforward--tiny groups that one only saw for a second in the heart of the\r\nthundering rain before they were separated by sable avalanches and\r\ncurtains of flaming smoke.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe bombardment over our heads grew less; it was chiefly over the place\r\nwhere we had been that it was increasing. But it might any minute\r\nisolate everything and destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe rain became more and more torrential--a deluge in the night. The\r\ndarkness was so deep that the star-shells only lit up slices of\r\nwater-seamed obscurity, in the depths of which fleeing phantoms came\r\nand went and ran round in circles.\r\n\r\nI cannot say how long I wandered with the group with which I had\r\nremained. We went into morasses. We strained our sight forward in quest\r\nof the embankment and the trench of salvation, towards the ditch that\r\nwas somewhere there, as towards a harbor.\r\n\r\nA cry of consolation was heard at last through the vapors of war and\r\nthe elements--"A trench!" But the embankment of that trench was moving;\r\nit was made of men mingled in confusion, who seemed to be coming out\r\nand abandoning it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stay there, mates!" cried the fugitives; "clear off, don\'t come\r\nnear. It\'s hell--everything\'s collapsing--the trenches are legging it\r\nand the dug-outs are bunged up--the mud\'s pouring in everywhere. There\r\nwon\'t be any trenches by the morning--it\'s all up with them about here!"\r\n\r\nThey disappeared. Where? We forgot to ask for some little direction\r\nfrom these men whose streaming shapes had no sooner appeared than they\r\nwere swallowed up in the dark.\r\n\r\nEven our little group crumbled away among the devastation, no longer\r\nknowing where they were. Now one, now another, faded into the night,\r\ndisappearing towards his chance of escape.\r\n\r\nWe climbed slopes and descended them. I saw dimly in front of me men\r\nbowed and hunchbacked, mounting a slippery incline where mud held them\r\nback, and the wind and rain repelled them under a dome of cloudy lights.\r\n\r\nThen we flowed back, and plunged into a marsh up to our knees. So high\r\nmust we lift our feet that we walked with a sound of swimming. Each\r\nforward stride was an enormous effort which slackened in agony.\r\n\r\nIt was there that we felt death drawing near. But we beached ourselves\r\nat last on a sort of clay embankment that divided the swamp. As we\r\nfollowed the slippery back of this slender island along, I remember\r\nthat once we had to stoop and steer ourselves by touching some\r\nhalf-buried corpses, so that we should not be thrown down from the soft\r\nand sinuous ridge. My hand discovered shoulders and hard backs, a face\r\ncold as a helmet, and a pipe still desperately bitten by dead jaws.\r\n\r\nAs we emerged and raised our heads at a venture we heard the sound of\r\nvoices not far away. "Voices! Ah, voices!" They sounded tranquil to us,\r\nas though they called us by our names, and we all came close together\r\nto approach this fraternal murmuring of men.\r\n\r\nThe words became distinct. They were quite near--in the hillock that we\r\ncould dimly see like an oasis: and yet we could not hear what they\r\nsaid. The sounds were muddled, and we did not understand them.\r\n\r\n"What are they saying?" asked one of us in a curious tone.\r\n\r\nInstinctively we stopped trying to find a way in. A doubt, a painful\r\nidea was seizing us. Then, clearly enunciated, there rang out these\r\nwords--"Achtung!--Zweites Geschutz--Schuss--" Farther back, the report\r\nof a gun answered the telephonic command.\r\n\r\nHorror and stupefaction nailed us to the spot at first--"Where are we?\r\nOh, Christ, where are we?" Turning right about face, slowly in spite of\r\nall, borne down anew by exhaustion and dismay, we took flight, as\r\noverwhelmed by weariness as if we had many wounds, pulled back by the\r\nmud towards the enemy country, and retaining only just enough energy to\r\nrepel the thought of the sweetness it would have been to let ourselves\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nWe came to a sort of great plain. We halted and threw ourselves on the\r\nground on the side of a mound, and leaned back upon it, unable to make\r\nanother step.\r\n\r\nAnd we moved no more, my shadowy comrades nor I. The rain splashed in\r\nour faces, streamed down our backs and chests, ran down from our knees\r\nand filled our boots.\r\n\r\nWe should perhaps be killed or taken prisoners when day came. But we\r\nthought no more of anything. We could do no more; we knew no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nThe Dawn\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are waiting for daylight in the place where we sank to the ground.\r\nSinister and slow it comes, chilling and dismal, and expands upon the\r\nlivid landscape.\r\n\r\nThe rain has ceased to fall--there is none left in the sky. The leaden\r\nplain and its mirrors of sullied water seem to issue not only from the\r\nnight but from the sea.\r\n\r\nDrowsy or half asleep, sometimes opening our eyes only to close them\r\nagain, we attend the incredible renewal of light, paralyzed with cold\r\nand broken with fatigue.\r\n\r\nWhere are the trenches?\r\n\r\nWe see lakes, and between the lakes there are lines of milky and\r\nmotionless water. There is more water even than we had thought. It has\r\ntaken everything and spread everywhere, and the prophecy of the men in\r\nthe night has come true. There are no more trenches; those canals are\r\nthe trenches enshrouded. It is a universal flood. The battlefield is\r\nnot sleeping; it is dead. Life may be going on down yonder perhaps, but\r\nwe cannot see so far.\r\n\r\nSwaying painfully, like a sick man, in the terrible encumbering clasp\r\nof my greatcoat, I half raise myself to look at it all. There are three\r\nmonstrously shapeless forms beside me. One of them--it is Paradis, in\r\nan amazing armor of mud, with a swelling at the waist that stands for\r\nhis cartridge pouches--gets up also. The others are asleep, and make no\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nAnd what is this silence, too, this prodigious silence? There is no\r\nsound, except when from time to time a lump of earth slips into the\r\nwater, in the middle of this fantastic paralysis of the world. No one\r\nis firing. There are no shells, for they would not burst. There are no\r\nbullets, either, for the men--\r\n\r\nAh, the men! Where are the men?\r\n\r\nWe see them gradually. Not far from us there are some stranded and\r\nsleeping hulks so molded in mud from head to foot that they are almost\r\ntransformed into inanimate objects.\r\n\r\nSome distance away I can make out others, curled up and clinging like\r\nsnails all along a rounded embankment, from which they have partly\r\nslipped back into the water. It is a motionless rank of clumsy lumps,\r\nof bundles placed side by side, dripping water and mud, and of the same\r\ncolor as the soil with which they are blended.\r\n\r\nI make an effort to break the silence. To Paradis, who also is looking\r\nthat way, I say, "Are they dead?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go and see presently," he says in a low voice; "stop here a bit\r\nyet. We shall have the heart to go there by and by."\r\n\r\nWe look at each other, and our eyes fall also on the others who came\r\nand fell down here. Their faces spell such weariness that they are no\r\nlonger faces so much as something dirty, disfigured and bruised, with\r\nblood-shot eyes. Since the beginning we have seen each other in all\r\nmanner of shapes and appearances, and yet--we do not know each other.\r\n\r\nParadis turns his head and looks elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I see him seized with trembling. He extends an arm enormously\r\ncaked in mud. "There--there--" he says.\r\n\r\nOn the water which overflows from a stretch particularly cross-seamed\r\nand gullied, some lumps are floating, some round-backed reefs.\r\n\r\nWe drag ourselves to the spot. They are drowned men. Their arms and\r\nheads are submerged. On the surface of the plastery liquid appear their\r\nbacks and the straps of their accouterments. Their blue cloth trousers\r\nare inflated, with the feet attached askew upon the ballooning legs,\r\nlike the black wooden feet on the shapeless legs of marionettes. From\r\none sunken head the hair stands straight up like water-weeds. Here is a\r\nface which the water only lightly touches; the head is beached on the\r\nmarge, and the body disappears in its turbid tomb. The face is lifted\r\nskyward. The eyes are two white holes; the mouth is a black hole. The\r\nmask\'s yellow and puffed-up skin appears soft and creased, like dough\r\ngone cold.\r\n\r\nThey are the men who were watching there, and could not extricate\r\nthemselves from the mud. All their efforts to escape over the sticky\r\nescarpment of the trench that was slowly and fatally filling with water\r\nonly dragged them still more into the depth. They died clinging to the\r\nyielding support of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere, our first lines are; and there, the first German lines, equally\r\nsilent and flooded. On our way to these flaccid ruins we pass through\r\nthe middle of what yesterday was the zone of terror, the awful space on\r\nwhose threshold the fierce rush of our last attack was forced to stop,\r\nthe No Man\'s Land which bullets and shells had not ceased to furrow for\r\na year and a half, where their crossed fire during these latter days\r\nhad furiously swept the ground from one horizon to the other.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a field of rest. The ground is everywhere dotted with beings\r\nwho sleep or who are on the way to die, slowly moving, lifting an arm,\r\nlifting the head.\r\n\r\nThe enemy trench is completing the process of foundering into itself,\r\namong great marshy undulations and funnel-holes, shaggy with mud: it\r\nforms among them a line of pools and wells. Here and there we can see\r\nthe still overhanging banks begin to move, crumble, and fall down. In\r\none place we can lean against it.\r\n\r\nIn this bewildering circle of filth there are no bodies. But there,\r\nworse than a body, a solitary arm protrudes, bare and white as a stone,\r\nfrom a hole which dimly shows on the other side of the water. The man\r\nhas been buried in his dug-out and has had only the time to thrust out\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nQuite near, we notice that some mounds of earth aligned along the\r\nruined ramparts of this deep-drowned ditch are human. Are they dead--or\r\nasleep? We do not know; in any case, they rest.\r\n\r\nAre they German or French? We do not know. One of them has opened his\r\neyes, and looks at us with swaying head. We say to him, "French?"--and\r\nthen, "Deutsch?" He makes no reply, but shuts his eyes again and\r\nrelapses into oblivion. We never knew what he was.\r\n\r\nWe cannot decide the identity of these beings, either by their clothes,\r\nthickly covered with filth, or by their head-dress, for they are\r\nbareheaded or swathed in woolens under their liquid and offensive\r\ncowls; or by their weapons, for they either have no rifles or their\r\nhands rest lightly on something they have dragged along, a shapeless\r\nand sticky mass, like to a sort of fish.\r\n\r\nAll these men of corpse-like faces who are before us and behind us, at\r\nthe limit of their strength, void of speech as of will, all these\r\nearth-charged men who you would say were carrying their own\r\nwinding-sheets, are as much alike as if they were naked. Out of the\r\nhorror of the night apparitions are issuing from this side and that who\r\nare clad in exactly the same uniform of misery and mud.\r\n\r\nIt is the end of all. For the moment it is the prodigious finish, the\r\nepic cessation of the war.\r\n\r\nI once used to think that the worst hell in war was the flame of\r\nshells; and then for long I thought it was the suffocation of the\r\ncaverns which eternally confine us. But it is neither of these. Hell is\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe wind is rising, and its icy breath goes through our flesh. On the\r\nwrecked and dissolving plain, flecked with bodies between its\r\nworm-shaped chasms of water, among the islands of motionless men stuck\r\ntogether like reptiles, in this flattening and sinking chaos there are\r\nsome slight indications of movement. We see slowly stirring groups and\r\nfragments of groups, composed of beings who bow under the weight of\r\ntheir coats and aprons of mud, who trail themselves along, disperse,\r\nand crawl about in the depths of the sky\'s tarnished light. The dawn is\r\nso foul that one would say the day was already done.\r\n\r\nThese survivors are migrating across the desolated steppe, pursued by\r\nan unspeakable evil which exhausts and bewilders them. They are\r\nlamentable objects; and some, when they are fully seen, are\r\ndramatically ludicrous, for the whelming mud from which they still take\r\nflight has half unclothed them.\r\n\r\nAs they pass by their glances go widely around. They look at us, and\r\ndiscovering men in us they cry through the wind, "It\'s worse down\r\nyonder than it is here. The chaps are falling into the holes, and you\r\ncan\'t pull them out. All them that trod on the edge of a shell-hole\r\nlast night, they\'re dead. Down there where we\'re coming from you can\r\nsee a head in the ground, working its arms, embedded. There\'s a\r\nhurdle-path that\'s given way in places and the hurdles have sunk into\r\nholes, and it\'s a man-trap. Where there\'s no more hurdles there\'s two\r\nyards deep of water. Your rifle? You couldn\'t pull it out again when\r\nyou\'d stuck it in. Look at those men, there. They\'ve cut off all the\r\nbottom half of their great-coats--hard lines on the pockets--to help\r\n\'em get clear, and also because they hadn\'t strength to drag a weight\r\nlike that. Dumas\' coat, we were able to pull it off him, and it weighed\r\na good eighty pounds; we could just lift it, two of us, with both our\r\nhands. Look--him with the bare legs; it\'s taken everything off him, his\r\ntrousers, his drawers, his boots, all dragged off by the mud. One\'s\r\nnever seen that, never."\r\n\r\nScattered and straggling, the herd takes flight in a fever of fear,\r\ntheir feet pulling huge stumps of mud out of the ground. We watch the\r\nhuman flotsam fade away, and the lumps of them diminish, immured in\r\nenormous clothes.\r\n\r\nWe get up, and at once the icy wind makes us tremble like trees. Slowly\r\nwe veer towards the mass formed by two men curiously joined, leaning\r\nshoulder to shoulder, and each with an arm round the neck of the other.\r\nIs it the hand-to-hand fight of two soldiers who have overpowered each\r\nother in death and still hold their own, who can never again lose their\r\ngrip? No; they are two men who recline upon each other so as to sleep.\r\nAs they might not spread themselves on the falling earth that was ready\r\nto spread itself on them, they have supported each other, clasping each\r\nother\'s shoulder; and thus plunged in the ground up to their knees,\r\nthey have gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nWe respect their stillness, and withdraw from the twin statue of human\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\nSoon we must halt ourselves. We have expected too much of our strength\r\nand can go no farther. It is not yet ended. We collapse once more in a\r\nchurned corner, with a noise as if one shot a load of dung.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time we open our eyes. Some men are steering for us,\r\nreeling. They lean over us and speak in low and weary tones. One of\r\nthem says, "Sie sind todt. Wir bleiben hier." (They\'re dead. We\'ll stay\r\nhere.) The other says, "Ja," like a sigh.\r\n\r\nBut they see us move, and at once they sink in front of us. The man\r\nwith the toneless voice says to us in French, "We surrender," and they\r\ndo not move. Then they give way entirely, as if this was the relief,\r\nthe end of their torture; and one of them whose face is patterned in\r\nmud like a savage tattooed, smiles slightly.\r\n\r\n"Stay there," says Paradis, without moving the head that he leans\r\nbackward upon a hillock; "presently you shall go with us if you want."\r\n\r\n"Yes," says the German, "I\'ve had enough." We make no reply, and he\r\nsays, "And the others too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Paradis, "let them stop too, if they like." There are four\r\nof them outstretched on the ground. The death-rattle has got one of\r\nthem. It is like a sobbing song that rises from him. The others then\r\nhalf straighten themselves, kneeling round him, and roll great eyes in\r\ntheir muck-mottled faces. We get up and watch the scene. But the rattle\r\ndies out, and the blackened throat which alone in all the big body\r\npulsed like a little bird, is still.\r\n\r\n"Er ist todt!" (He\'s dead) says one of the men, beginning to cry. The\r\nothers settle themselves again to sleep. The weeper goes to sleep as he\r\nweeps.\r\n\r\nOther soldiers have come, stumbling, gripped in sudden halts like tipsy\r\nmen, or gliding along like worms, to take sanctuary here; and we sleep\r\nall jumbled together in the common grave.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWaking, Paradis and I look at each other, and remember. We return to\r\nlife and daylight as in a nightmare. In front of us the calamitous\r\nplain is resurrected, where hummocks vaguely appear from their\r\nimmersion, the steel-like plain that is rusty in places and shines with\r\nlines and pools of water, while bodies are strewn here and there in the\r\nvastness like foul rubbish, prone bodies that breathe or rot.\r\n\r\nParadis says to me, "That\'s war."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it," he repeats in a far-away voice, "that\'s war. It\'s not\r\nanything else."\r\n\r\nHe means--and I am with him in his meaning--"More than attacks that are\r\nlike ceremonial reviews, more than visible battles unfurled like\r\nbanners, more even than the hand-to-hand encounters of shouting strife,\r\nWar is frightful and unnatural weariness, water up to the belly, mud\r\nand dung and infamous filth. It is befouled faces and tattered flesh,\r\nit is the corpses that are no longer like corpses even, floating on the\r\nravenous earth. It is that, that endless monotony of misery, broken, by\r\npoignant tragedies; it is that, and not the bayonet glittering like\r\nsilver, nor the bugle\'s chanticleer call to the sun!"\r\n\r\nParadis was so full of this thought that he ruminated a memory, and\r\ngrowled, "D\'you remember the woman in the town where we went about a\r\nbit not so very long ago? She talked some drivel about attacks, and\r\nsaid, \'How beautiful they must be to see!\'"\r\n\r\nA chasseur who was full length on his belly, flattened out like a\r\ncloak, raised his head out of the filthy background in which it was\r\nsunk, and cried, "Beautiful? Oh, hell! It\'s just as if an ox were to\r\nsay, \'What a fine sight it must be, all those droves of cattle driven\r\nforward to the slaughter-house!\'" He spat out mud from his besmeared\r\nmouth, and his unburied face was like a beast\'s.\r\n\r\n"Let them say, \'It must be,\'" he sputtered in a strange jerky voice,\r\ngrating and ragged; "that\'s all right. But beautiful! Oh, hell!"\r\n\r\nWrithing under the idea, he added passionately, "It\'s when they say\r\nthings like that that they hit us hardest of all!" He spat again, but\r\nexhausted by his effort he fell back in his bath of mud, and laid his\r\nhead in his spittle.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nParadis, possessed by his notion, waved his hand towards the wide\r\nunspeakable landscape, and looking steadily on it repeated his\r\nsentence, "War is that. It is that everywhere. What are we, we chaps,\r\nand what\'s all this here? Nothing at all. All we can see is only a\r\nspeck. You\'ve got to remember that this morning there\'s three thousand\r\nkilometers of equal evils, or nearly equal, or worse."\r\n\r\n"And then," said the comrade at our side, whom we could not recognize\r\neven by his voice, "to-morrow it begins again. It began again the day\r\nbefore yesterday, and all the days before that!"\r\n\r\nWith an effort as if he was tearing the ground, the chasseur dragged\r\nhis body out of the earth where he had molded a depression like an\r\noozing coffin, and sat in the hole. He blinked his eyes and tried to\r\nshake the balance of mud from his face, and said, "We shall come out of\r\nit again this time. And who knows, p\'raps we shall come out of it again\r\nto-morrow! Who knows?"\r\n\r\nParadis, with his back bent under mats of earth and clay, was trying to\r\nconvey his idea that the war cannot be imagined or measured in terms of\r\ntime and space. "When one speaks of the whole war," he said, thinking\r\naloud, "it\'s as if you said nothing at all--the words are strangled.\r\nWe\'re here, and we look at it all like blind men."\r\n\r\nA bass voice rolled to us from a little farther away, "No, one cannot\r\nimagine it."\r\n\r\nAt these words a burst of harsh laughter tore itself from some one.\r\n"How could you imagine it, to begin with, if you hadn\'t been there?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d have to be mad," said the chasseur.\r\n\r\nParadis leaned over a sprawling outspread mass beside him and said,\r\n"Are you asleep?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I\'m not going to budge." The smothered and terror-struck\r\nmutter issued instantly from the mass that was covered with a thick and\r\nslimy horse-cloth, so indented that it seemed to have been trampled.\r\n"I\'ll tell you why. I believe my belly\'s shot through. But I\'m not\r\nsure, and I daren\'t find out."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see--"\r\n\r\n"No, not yet," says the man. "I\'d rather stop on a bit like this."\r\n\r\nThe others, dragging themselves on their elbows, began to make\r\nsplashing movements, by way of casting off the clammy infernal covering\r\nthat weighed them down. The paralysis of cold was passing away from the\r\nknot of sufferers, though the light no longer made any progress over\r\nthe great irregular marsh of the lower plain. The desolation proceeded,\r\nbut not the day.\r\n\r\nThen he who spoke sorrowfully, like a bell, said. "It\'ll be no good\r\ntelling about it, eh? They wouldn\'t believe you; not out of malice or\r\nthrough liking to pull your leg, but because they couldn\'t. When you\r\nsay to \'em later, if you live to say it, \'We were on a night job and we\r\ngot shelled and we were very nearly drowned in mud,\' they\'ll say, \'Ah!\'\r\nAnd p\'raps they\'ll say. \'You didn\'t have a very spicy time on the job.\'\r\nAnd that\'s all. No one can know it. Only us."\r\n\r\n"No, not even us, not even us!" some one cried.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I say, too. We shall forget--we\'re forgetting already, my\r\nboy!"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve seen too much to remember."\r\n\r\n"And everything we\'ve seen was too much. We\'re not made to hold it all.\r\nIt takes its damned hook in all directions. We\'re too little to hold\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, we shall forget! Not only the length of the big misery,\r\nwhich can\'t be calculated, as you say, ever since the beginning, but\r\nthe marches that turn up the ground and turn it again, lacerating your\r\nfeet and wearing out your bones under a load that seems to grow bigger\r\nin the sky, the exhaustion until you don\'t know your own name any more,\r\nthe tramping and the inaction that grind you, the digging jobs that\r\nexceed your strength, the endless vigils when you fight against sleep\r\nand watch for an enemy who is everywhere in the night, the pillows of\r\ndung and lice--we shall forget not only those, but even the foul wounds\r\nof shells and machine-guns, the mines, the gas, and the\r\ncounter-attacks. At those moments you\'re full of the excitement of\r\nreality, and you\'ve some satisfaction. But all that wears off and goes\r\naway, you don\'t know how and you don\'t know where, and there\'s only the\r\nnames left, only the words of it, like in a dispatch."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true what he says," remarks a man, without moving his head in\r\nits pillory of mud. "When I was on leave, I found I\'d already jolly\r\nwell forgotten what had happened to me before. There were some letters\r\nfrom me that I read over again just as if they were a book I was\r\nopening. And yet in spite of that, I\'ve forgotten also all the pain\r\nI\'ve had in the war. We\'re forgetting-machines. Men are things that\r\nthink a little but chiefly forget. That\'s what we are."\r\n\r\n"Then neither the other side nor us\'ll remember! So much misery all\r\nwasted!"\r\n\r\nThis point of view added to the abasement of these beings on the shore\r\nof the flood, like news of a greater disaster, and humiliated them\r\nstill more.\r\n\r\n"Ah, if one did remember!" cried some one.\r\n\r\n"If we remembered," said another, "there wouldn\'t be any more war."\r\n\r\nA third added grandly, "Yes, if we remembered, war would be less\r\nuseless than it is."\r\n\r\nBut suddenly one of the prone survivors rose to his knees, dark as a\r\ngreat bat ensnared, and as the mud dripped from his waving arms he\r\ncried in a hollow voice, "There must be no more war after this!"\r\n\r\nIn that miry corner where, still feeble unto impotence, we were beset\r\nby blasts of wind which laid hold on us with such rude strength that\r\nthe very ground seemed to sway like sea-drift, the cry of the man who\r\nlooked as if he were trying to fly away evoked other like cries: "There\r\nmust be no more war after this!"\r\n\r\nThe sullen or furious exclamations of these men fettered to the earth,\r\nincarnate of earth, arose and slid away on the wind like beating wings--\r\n\r\n"No more war! No more war! Enough of it!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s too stupid--it\'s too stupid," they mumbled.\r\n\r\n"What does it mean, at the bottom of it, all this?--all this that you\r\ncan\'t even give a name to?"\r\n\r\nThey snarled and growled like wild beasts on that sort of ice-floe\r\ncontended for by the elements, in their dismal disguise of ragged mud.\r\nSo huge was the protest thus rousing them in revolt that it choked them.\r\n\r\n"We\'re made to live, not to be done in like this!"\r\n\r\n"Men are made to be husbands, fathers--men, what the devil!--not beasts\r\nthat hunt each other and cut each other\'s throats and make themselves\r\nstink like all that."\r\n\r\n"And yet, everywhere--everywhere--there are beasts, savage beasts or\r\nsmashed beasts. Look, look!"\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the look of those limitless lands wherefrom the\r\nwater had corroded all color and form, whose contours crumbled on all\r\nsides under the assault of the liquid putrescence that flowed across\r\nthe broken bones of stakes and wire and framing; nor, rising above\r\nthose things amid the sullen Stygian immensity, can I ever forget the\r\nvision of the thrill of reason, logic and simplicity that suddenly\r\nshook these men like a fit of madness.\r\n\r\nI could see them agitated by this idea--that to try to live one\'s life\r\non earth and to be happy is not only a right but a duty, and even an\r\nideal and a virtue; that the only end of social life is to make easy\r\nthe inner life of every one.\r\n\r\n"To live!"--"All of us!"--"You!"--"Me!"\r\n\r\n"No more war--ah, no!--it\'s too stupid--worse than that, it\'s too--"\r\n\r\nFor a finishing echo to their half-formed thought a saying came to the\r\nmangled and miscarried murmur of the mob from a filth-crowned face that\r\nI saw arise from the level of the earth--"Two armies fighting each\r\nother--that\'s like one great army committing suicide!"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"And likewise, what have we been for two years now? Incredibly pitiful\r\nwretches, and savages as well, brutes, robbers, and dirty devils."\r\n\r\n"Worse than that!" mutters he whose only phrase it is.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I admit it!"\r\n\r\nIn their troubled truce of the morning, these men whom fatigue had\r\ntormented, whom rain had scourged, whom night-long lightning had\r\nconvulsed, these survivors of volcanoes and flood began not only to see\r\ndimly how war, as hideous morally as physically, outrages common sense,\r\ndebases noble ideas and dictates all kind of crime, but they remembered\r\nhow it had enlarged in them and about them every evil instinct save\r\nnone, mischief developed into lustful cruelty, selfishness into\r\nferocity, the hunger for enjoyment into a mania.\r\n\r\nThey are picturing all this before their eyes as just now they\r\nconfusedly pictured their misery. They are crammed with a curse which\r\nstrives to find a way out and to come to light in words, a curse which\r\nmakes them to groan and wail. It is as if they toiled to emerge from\r\nthe delusion and ignorance which soil them as the mud soils them; as if\r\nthey will at last know why they are scourged.\r\n\r\n"Well then?" clamors one.\r\n\r\n"Ay, what then?" the other repeats, still more grandly. The wind sets\r\nthe flooded flats a-tremble to our eyes, and falling furiously on the\r\nhuman masses lying or kneeling and fixed like flagstones and\r\ngrave-slabs, it wrings new shivering from them.\r\n\r\n"There will be no more war," growls a soldier, "when there is no more\r\nGermany."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the right thing to say!" cries another. "It isn\'t enough.\r\nThere\'ll be no more war when the spirit of war is defeated." The\r\nroaring of the wind half smothered his words, so he lifted his head and\r\nrepeated them.\r\n\r\n"Germany and militarism"--some one in his anger precipitately cut\r\nin--"they\'re the same thing. They wanted the war and they\'d planned it\r\nbeforehand. They are militarism."\r\n\r\n"Militarism--" a soldier began again.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" some one asked.\r\n\r\n"It\'s--it\'s brute force that\'s ready prepared, and that lets fly\r\nsuddenly, any minute."\r\n\r\n"Yes. To-day militarism is called Germany."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but what will it be called to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said a voice serious as a prophet\'s.\r\n\r\n"If the spirit of war isn\'t killed, you\'ll have struggle all through\r\nthe ages."\r\n\r\n"We must--one\'s got to--"\r\n\r\n"We must fight!" gurgled the hoarse voice of a man who had lain stiff\r\nin the devouring mud ever since our awakening; "we\'ve got to!" His body\r\nturned heavily over. "We\'ve got to give all we have, our strength and\r\nour skins and our hearts, all our life and what pleasures are left us.\r\nThe life of prisoners as we are, we\'ve got to take it in both hands.\r\nYou\'ve got to endure everything, even injustice--and that\'s the king\r\nthat\'s reigning now--and the shameful and disgusting sights we see, so\r\nas to come out on top, and win. But if we\'ve got to make such a\r\nsacrifice," adds the shapeless man, turning over again, "it\'s because\r\nwe\'re fighting for progress, not for a country; against error, not\r\nagainst a country."\r\n\r\n"War must be killed," said the first speaker, "war must be killed in\r\nthe belly of Germany!"\r\n\r\n"Anyway," said one of those who sat enrooted there like a sort of\r\nshrub, "anyway, we\'re beginning to understand why we\'ve got to march\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"All the same," grumbled the squatting chasseur in his turn, "there are\r\nsome that fight with quite another idea than that in their heads. I\'ve\r\nseen some of \'em, young men, who said, \'To hell with humanitarian\r\nideas\'; what mattered to them was nationality and nothing else, and the\r\nwar was a question of fatherlands--let every man make a shine about his\r\nown. They were fighting, those chaps, and they were fighting well."\r\n\r\n"They\'re young, the lads you\'re talking about; they\'re young, and we\r\nmust excuse \'em."\r\n\r\n"You can do a thing well without knowing what you are doing."\r\n\r\n"Men are mad, that\'s true. You\'ll never say that often enough."\r\n\r\n"The Jingoes--they\'re vermin," growled a shadow.\r\n\r\nSeveral times they repeated, as though feeling their way, "War must be\r\nkilled; war itself."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all silly talk. What diff does it make whether you think this\r\nor that? We\'ve got to be winners, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nBut the others had begun to cast about. They wanted to know and to see\r\nfarther than to-day. They throbbed with the effort to beget in\r\nthemselves some light of wisdom and of will. Some sparse convictions\r\nwhirled in their minds, and jumbled scraps of creeds issued from their\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n"Of course--yes--but we must look at facts--you\'ve got to think about\r\nthe object, old chap."\r\n\r\n"The object? To be winners in this war," the pillar-man insisted,\r\n"isn\'t that an object?"\r\n\r\nTwo there were who replied together, "No!"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a dull noise; cries broke out around us, and\r\nwe shuddered. A length of earth had detached itself from the hillock on\r\nwhich--after a fashion--we were leaning back, and had completely\r\nexhumed in the middle of us a sitting corpse, with its legs out full\r\nlength. The collapse burst a pool that had gathered on the top of the\r\nmound, and the water spread like a cascade over the body and laved it\r\nas we looked.\r\n\r\nSome one cried, "His face is all black!"\r\n\r\n"What is that face?" gasped a voice.\r\n\r\nThose who were able drew near in a circle, like frogs. We could not\r\ngaze upon the head that showed in low relief upon the trench-wall that\r\nthe landslide had laid bare. "His face? It isn\'t his face!" In place of\r\nthe face we found the hair, and then we saw that the corpse which had\r\nseemed to be sitting was broken, and folded the wrong way. In dreadful\r\nsilence we looked on the vertical back of the dislocated dead, upon the\r\nhanging arms, backward curved, and the two outstretched legs that\r\nrested on the sinking soil by the points of the toes. Then the\r\ndiscussion began again, revived by this fearful sleeper. As though the\r\ncorpse was listening they clamored--"No! To win isn\'t the object. It\r\nisn\'t those others we\'ve got to get at--it\'s war."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you see that we\'ve got to finish with war? If we\'ve got to begin\r\nagain some day, all that\'s been done is no good. Look at it there!--and\r\nit would be in vain. It would be two or three years or more of wasted\r\ncatastrophe."\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"Ah, my boy, if all we\'ve gone through wasn\'t the end of this great\r\ncalamity! I value my life; I\'ve got my wife, my family, my home around\r\nthem; I\'ve got schemes for my life afterwards, mind you. Well, all the\r\nsame, if this wasn\'t the end of it, I\'d rather die."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to die." The echo came at that moment exactly from Paradis\'\r\nneighbor, who no doubt had examined the wound in his belly. "I\'m sorry\r\non account of my children."\r\n\r\n"It\'s on account of my children that I\'m not sorry," came a murmur from\r\nsomewhere else. "I\'m dying, so I know what I\'m saying, and I say to\r\nmyself, \'They\'ll have peace.\'"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shan\'t die," said another, with a quiver of hope that he\r\ncould not restrain even in the presence of the doomed, "but I shall\r\nsuffer. Well, I say, \'more\'s the pity,\' and I even say \'that\'s all\r\nright\'; and I shall know how to stick more suffering if I know it\'s for\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll have to go on fighting after the war?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, p\'raps--"\r\n\r\n"You want more of it, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, because I want no more of it," the voice grunted. "And p\'raps\r\nit\'ll not be foreigners that we\'ve got to fight?"\r\n\r\n"P\'raps, yes--"\r\n\r\nA still more violent blast of wind shut our eyes and choked us. When it\r\nhad passed, and we saw the volley take flight across the plain, seizing\r\nand shaking its muddy plunder and furrowing the water in the long\r\ngaping trenches--long as the grave of an army--we began again.\r\n\r\n"After all, what is it that makes the mass and the horror of war?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the mass of the people."\r\n\r\n"But the people--that\'s us!"\r\n\r\nHe who had said it looked at me inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said to him, "yes, old boy, that\'s true! It\'s with us only\r\nthat they make battles. It is we who are the material of war. War is\r\nmade up of the flesh and the souls of common soldiers only. It is we\r\nwho make the plains of dead and the rivers of blood, all of us, and\r\neach of us is invisible and silent because of the immensity of our\r\nnumbers. The emptied towns and the villages destroyed, they are a\r\nwilderness of our making. Yes, war is all of us, and all of us\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s true. It\'s the people who are war; without them, there\r\nwould be nothing, nothing but some wrangling, a long way off. But it\r\nisn\'t they who decide on it; it\'s the masters who steer them."\r\n\r\n"The people are struggling to-day to have no more masters that steer\r\nthem. This war, it\'s like the French Revolution continuing."\r\n\r\n"Well then, if that\'s so, we\'re working for the Prussians too?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s to be hoped so," said one of the wretches of the plain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell!" said the chasseur, grinding his teeth. But he shook his\r\nhead and added no more.\r\n\r\n"We want to look after ourselves! You shouldn\'t meddle in other\r\npeople\'s business," mumbled the obstinate snarler.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you should! Because what you call \'other people,\' that\'s just\r\nwhat they\'re not--they\'re the same!"\r\n\r\n"Why is it always us that has to march away for everybody?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" said a man, and he repeated the words he had used a moment\r\nbefore. "More\'s the pity, or so much the better."\r\n\r\n"The people--they\'re nothing, though they ought to be everything," then\r\nsaid the man who had questioned me, recalling, though he did not know\r\nit, an historic sentence of more than a century ago, but investing it\r\nat last with its great universal significance. Escaped from torment, on\r\nall fours in the deep grease of the ground, he lifted his leper-like\r\nface and looked hungrily before him into infinity.\r\n\r\nHe looked and looked. He was trying to open the gates of heaven.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"The peoples of the world ought to come to an understanding, through\r\nthe hides and on the bodies of those who exploit them one way or\r\nanother. All the masses ought to agree together."\r\n\r\n"All men ought to be equal."\r\n\r\nThe word seems to come to us like a rescue.\r\n\r\n"Equal--yes--yes--there are some great meanings for justice and truth.\r\nThere are some things one believes in, that one turns to and clings to\r\nas if they were a sort of light. There\'s equality, above all."\r\n\r\n"There\'s liberty and fraternity, too."\r\n\r\n"But principally equality!"\r\n\r\nI tell them that fraternity is a dream, an obscure and uncertain\r\nsentiment; that while it is unnatural for a man to hate one whom he\r\ndoes not know, it is equally unnatural to love him. You can build\r\nnothing on fraternity. Nor on liberty, either; it is too relative a\r\nthing in a society where all the elements subdivide each other by force.\r\n\r\nBut equality is always the same. Liberty and fraternity are words while\r\nequality is a fact. Equality should be the great human formula--social\r\nequality, for while individuals have varying values, each must have an\r\nequal share in the social life; and that is only just, because the life\r\nof one human being is equal to the life of another. That formula is of\r\nprodigious importance. The principle of the equal rights of every\r\nliving being and the sacred will of the majority is infallible and must\r\nbe invincible; all progress will be brought about by it, all, with a\r\nforce truly divine. It will bring first the smooth bed-rock of all\r\nprogress--the settling of quarrels by that justice which is exactly the\r\nsame thing as the general advantage.\r\n\r\nAnd these men of the people, dimly seeing some unknown Revolution\r\ngreater than the other, a revolution springing from themselves and\r\nalready rising, rising in their throats, repeat "Equality!"\r\n\r\nIt seems as if they were spelling the word and then reading it\r\ndistinctly on all sides--that there is not upon the earth any\r\nprivilege, prejudice or injustice that does not collapse in contact\r\nwith it. It is an answer to all, a word of sublimity. They revolve the\r\nidea over and over, and find a kind of perfection in it. They see\r\nerrors and abuses burning in a brilliant light.\r\n\r\n"That would be fine!" said one.\r\n\r\n"Too fine to be true!" said another.\r\n\r\nBut the third said, "It\'s because it\'s true that it\'s fine. It has no\r\nother beauty, mind! And it\'s not because it\'s fine that it will come.\r\nFineness is not in vogue, any more than love is. It\'s because it\'s true\r\nthat it has to be."\r\n\r\n"Then, since justice is wanted by the people, and the people have the\r\npower, let them do it."\r\n\r\n"They\'re beginning already!" said some obscure lips.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the way things are running," declared another.\r\n\r\n"When all men have made themselves equal, we shall be forced to unite."\r\n\r\n"And there\'ll no longer be appalling things done in the face of heaven\r\nby thirty million men who don\'t wish them."\r\n\r\nIt is true, and there is nothing to reply to it. What pretended\r\nargument or shadow of an answer dare one oppose to it--"There\'ll no\r\nlonger be the things done in the face of heaven by thirty millions of\r\nmen who don\'t want to do them!"\r\n\r\nSuch is the logic that I hear and follow of the words, spoken by these\r\npitiful fellows cast upon the field of affliction, the words which\r\nspring from their bruises and pains, the words which bleed from them.\r\n\r\nNow, the sky is all overcast. Low down it is armored in steely blue by\r\ngreat clouds. Above, in a weakly luminous silvering, it is crossed by\r\nenormous sweepings of wet mist. The weather is worsening, and more rain\r\non the way. The end of the tempest and the long trouble is not yet.\r\n\r\n"We shall say to ourselves," says one, "\'After all, why do we make\r\nwar?\' We don\'t know at all why, but we can say who we make it for. We\r\nshall be forced to see that if every nation every day brings the fresh\r\nbodies of fifteen hundred young men to the God of War to be lacerated,\r\nit\'s for the pleasure of a few ringleaders that we could easily count;\r\nthat if whole nations go to slaughter marshaled in armies in order that\r\nthe gold-striped caste may write their princely names in history, so\r\nthat other gilded people of the same rank can contrive more business,\r\nand expand in the way of employees and shops--and we shall see, as soon\r\nas we open our eyes, that the divisions between mankind are not what we\r\nthought, and those one did believe in are not divisions."\r\n\r\n"Listen!" some one broke in suddenly.\r\n\r\nWe hold our peace, and hear afar the sound of guns. Yonder, the\r\ngrowling is agitating the gray strata of the sky, and the distant\r\nviolence breaks feebly on our buried ears. All around us, the waters\r\ncontinue to sap the earth and by degrees to ensnare its heights.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beginning again."\r\n\r\nThen one of us says, "Ah, look what we\'ve got against us!"\r\n\r\nAlready there is uneasy hesitation in these castaways\' discussion of\r\ntheir tragedy, in the huge masterpiece of destiny that they are roughly\r\nsketching. It is not only the peril and pain, the misery of the moment,\r\nwhose endless beginning they see again. It is the enmity of\r\ncircumstances and people against the truth, the accumulation of\r\nprivilege and ignorance, of deafness and unwillingness, the taken\r\nsides, the savage conditions accepted, the immovable masses, the\r\ntangled lines.\r\n\r\nAnd the dream of fumbling thought is continued in another vision, in\r\nwhich everlasting enemies emerge from the shadows of the past and stand\r\nforth in the stormy darkness of to-day.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nHere they are. We seem to see them silhouetted against the sky, above\r\nthe crests of the storm that beglooms the world--a cavalcade of\r\nwarriors, prancing and flashing, the charges that carry armor and\r\nplumes and gold ornament, crowns and swords. They are burdened with\r\nweapons; they send forth gleams of light; magnificent they roll. The\r\nantiquated movements of the warlike ride divide the clouds like the\r\npainted fierceness of a theatrical scene.\r\n\r\nAnd far above the fevered gaze of them who are upon the ground, whose\r\nbodies are layered with the dregs of the earth and the wasted fields,\r\nthe phantom cohort flows from the four corners of the horizon, drives\r\nback the sky\'s infinity and hides its blue deeps.\r\n\r\nAnd they are legion. They are not only the warrior caste who shout as\r\nthey fight and have joy of it, not only those whom universal slavery\r\nhas clothed in magic power, the mighty by birth, who tower here and\r\nthere above the prostration of the human race and will take their\r\nsudden stand by the scales of justice when they think they see great\r\nprofit to gain; not only these, but whole multitudes who minister\r\nconsciously or unconsciously to their fearful privilege.\r\n\r\n"There are those who say," now cries one of the somber and compelling\r\ntalkers, extending his hand as though he could see the pageant, "there\r\nare those who say, \'How fine they are!\'"\r\n\r\n"And those who say, \'The nations hate each other!\'"\r\n\r\n"And those who say, \'I get fat on war, and my belly matures on it!\'"\r\n\r\n"And those who say, \'There has always been war, so there always will\r\nbe!\'"\r\n\r\n"There are those who say, \'I can\'t see farther than the end of my nose,\r\nand I forbid others to see farther!\'"\r\n\r\n"There are those who say, \'Babies come into the world with either red\r\nor blue breeches on!\'"\r\n\r\n"There are those," growled a hoarse voice, "who say, \'Bow your head and\r\ntrust in God!\'"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAh, you are right, poor countless workmen of the battles, you who have\r\nmade with your hands all of the Great War, you whose omnipotence is not\r\nyet used for well-doing, you human host whose every face is a world of\r\nsorrows, you who dream bowed under the yoke of a thought beneath that\r\nsky where long black clouds rend themselves and expand in disheveled\r\nlengths like evil angels--yes, you are right. There are all those\r\nthings against you. Against you and your great common interests which\r\nas you dimly saw are the same thing in effect as justice, there are not\r\nonly the sword-wavers, the profiteers, and the intriguers.\r\n\r\nThere is not only the prodigious opposition of interested\r\nparties--financiers, speculators great and small, armorplated in their\r\nbanks and houses, who live on war and live in peace during war, with\r\ntheir brows stubbornly set upon a secret doctrine and their faces shut\r\nup like safes.\r\n\r\nThere are those who admire the exchange of flashing blows, who hail\r\nlike women the bright colors of uniforms; those whom military music and\r\nthe martial ballads poured upon the public intoxicate as with brandy;\r\nthe dizzy-brained, the feeble-minded, the superstitious, the savages.\r\n\r\nThere are those who bury themselves in the past, on whose lips are the\r\nsayings only of bygone days, the traditionalists for whom an injustice\r\nhas legal force because it is perpetuated, who aspire to be guided by\r\nthe dead, who strive to subordinate progress and the future and all\r\ntheir palpitating passion to the realm of ghosts and nursery-tales.\r\n\r\nWith them are all the parsons, who seek to excite you and to lull you\r\nto sleep with the morphine of their Paradise, so that nothing may\r\nchange. There are the lawyers, the economists, the historians--and how\r\nmany more?--who befog you with the rigmarole of theory, who declare the\r\ninter-antagonism of nationalities at a time when the only unity\r\npossessed by each nation of to-day is in the arbitrary map-made lines\r\nof her frontiers, while she is inhabited by an artificial amalgam of\r\nraces; there are the worm-eaten genealogists, who forge for the\r\nambitious of conquest and plunder false certificates of philosophy and\r\nimaginary titles of nobility. The infirmity of human intelligence is\r\nshort sight. In too many cases, the wiseacres are dunces of a sort, who\r\nlose sight of the simplicity of things, and stifle and obscure it with\r\nformulae and trivialities. It is the small things that one learns from\r\nbooks, not the great ones.\r\n\r\nAnd even while they are saying that they do not wish for war they are\r\ndoing all they can to perpetuate it. They nourish national vanity and\r\nthe love of supremacy by force. "We alone," they say, each behind his\r\nshelter, "we alone are the guardians of courage and loyalty, of ability\r\nand good taste!" Out of the greatness and richness of a country they\r\nmake something like a consuming disease. Out of patriotism--which can\r\nbe respected as long as it remains in the domain of sentiment and art\r\non exactly the same footing as the sense of family and local pride, all\r\nequally sacred--out of patriotism they make a Utopian and impracticable\r\nidea, unbalancing the world, a sort of cancer which drains all the\r\nliving force, spreads everywhere and crushes life, a contagious cancer\r\nwhich culminates either in the crash of war or in the exhaustion and\r\nsuffocation of armed peace.\r\n\r\nThey pervert the most admirable of moral principles. How many are the\r\ncrimes of which they have made virtues merely by dowering them with the\r\nword "national"? They distort even truth itself. For the truth which is\r\neternally the same they substitute each their national truth. So many\r\nnations, so many truths; and thus they falsify and twist the truth.\r\n\r\nThose are your enemies. All those people whose childish and odiously\r\nridiculous disputes you hear snarling above you--"It wasn\'t me that\r\nbegan, it was you!"--"No, it wasn\'t me, it was you!"--"Hit me\r\nthen!"--"No, you hit me!"--those puerilities that perpetuate the\r\nworld\'s huge wound, for the disputants are not the people truly\r\nconcerned, but quite the contrary, nor do they desire to have done with\r\nit; all those people who cannot or will not make peace on earth; all\r\nthose who for one reason or another cling to the ancient state of\r\nthings and find or invent excuses for it--they are your enemies!\r\n\r\nThey are your enemies as much as those German soldiers are to-day who\r\nare prostrate here between you in the mud, who are only poor dupes\r\nhatefully deceived and brutalized, domestic beasts. They are your\r\nenemies, wherever they were born, however they pronounce their names,\r\nwhatever the language in which they lie. Look at them, in the heaven\r\nand on the earth. Look at them, everywhere! Identify them once for all,\r\nand be mindful for ever!\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"They will say to you," growled a kneeling man who stooped with his two\r\nhands in the earth and shook his shoulders like a mastiff, \'My friend,\r\nyou have been a wonderful hero!\' I don\'t want them to say it!\r\n\r\n"Heroes? Some sort of extraordinary being? Idols? Rot! We\'ve been\r\nmurderers. We have respectably followed the trade of hangmen. We shall\r\ndo it again with all our might, because it\'s of great importance to\r\nfollow that trade, so as to punish war and smother it. The act of\r\nslaughter is always ignoble; sometimes necessary, but always ignoble.\r\nYes, hard and persistent murderers, that\'s what we\'ve been. But don\'t\r\ntalk to me about military virtue because I\'ve killed Germans."\r\n\r\n"Nor to me," cried another in so loud a voice that no one could have\r\nreplied to him even had he dared; "nor to me, because I\'ve saved the\r\nlives of Frenchmen! Why, we might as well set fire to houses for the\r\nsake of the excellence of life-saving!"\r\n\r\n"It would be a crime to exhibit the fine side of war, even if there\r\nwere one!" murmured one of the somber soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe first man continued. "They\'ll say those things to us by way of\r\npaying us with glory, and to pay themselves, too, for what they haven\'t\r\ndone. But military glory--it isn\'t even true for us common soldiers.\r\nIt\'s for some, but outside those elect the soldier\'s glory is a lie,\r\nlike every other fine-looking thing in war. In reality, the soldier\'s\r\nsacrifice is obscurely concealed. The multitudes that make up the waves\r\nof attack have no reward. They run to hurl themselves into a frightful\r\ninglorious nothing. You cannot even heap up their names, their poor\r\nlittle names of nobodies."\r\n\r\n"To hell with it all," replies a man, "we\'ve got other things to think\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"But all that," hiccupped a face which the mud concealed like a hideous\r\nhand, "may you even say it? You\'d be cursed, and \'shot at dawn\'!\r\nThey\'ve made around a Marshal\'s plumes a religion as bad and stupid and\r\nmalignant as the other!"\r\n\r\nThe man raised himself, fell down, and rose again. The wound that he\r\nhad under his armor of filth was staining the ground, and when he had\r\nspoken, his wide-open eyes looked down at all the blood he had given\r\nfor the healing of the world.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe others, one by one, straighten themselves. The storm is falling\r\nmore heavily on the expanse of flayed and martyred fields. The day is\r\nfull of night. It is as if new enemy shapes of men and groups of men\r\nare rising unceasingly on the crest of the mountain-chain of clouds,\r\nround about the barbaric outlines of crosses, eagles, churches, royal\r\nand military palaces and temples. They seem to multiply there, shutting\r\nout the stars that are fewer than mankind; it seems even as if these\r\napparitions are moving in all directions in the excavated ground, here,\r\nthere, among the real beings who are thrown there at random, half\r\nburied in the earth like grains of corn.\r\n\r\nMy still living companions have at last got up. Standing with\r\ndifficulty on the foundered soil, enclosed in their bemired garb, laid\r\nout in strange upright coffins of mud, raising their huge simplicity\r\nout of the earth\'s depths--a profoundity like that of ignorance--they\r\nmove and cry out, with their gaze, their arms and their fists extended\r\ntowards the sky whence fall daylight and storm. They are struggling\r\nagainst victorious specters, like the Cyranos and Don Quixotes that\r\nthey still are.\r\n\r\nOne sees their shadows stirring on the shining sad expanse of the\r\nplain, and reflected in the pallid stagnant surface of the old\r\ntrenches, which now only the infinite void of space inhabits and\r\npurifies, in the center of a polar desert whose horizons fume.\r\n\r\nBut their eyes are opened. They are beginning to make out the boundless\r\nsimplicity of things. And Truth not only invests them with a dawn of\r\nhope, but raises on it a renewal of strength and courage.\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough talk about those others!" one of the men commanded; "all\r\nthe worse for them!--Us! Us all!" The understanding between\r\ndemocracies, the entente among the multitudes, the uplifting of the\r\npeople of the world, the bluntly simple faith! All the rest, aye, all\r\nthe rest, in the past, the present and the future, matters nothing at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAnd a soldier ventures to add this sentence, though he begins it with\r\nlowered voice, "If the present war has advanced progress by one step,\r\nits miseries and slaughter will count for little."\r\n\r\nAnd while we get ready to rejoin the others and begin war again, the\r\ndark and storm-choked sky slowly opens above our heads. Between two\r\nmasses of gloomy cloud a tranquil gleam emerges; and that line of\r\nlight, so blackedged and beset, brings even so its proof that the sun\r\nis there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Under Fire, by Henri Barbusse\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNDER FIRE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 4380.txt or 4380.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/4/3/8/4380/\r\n\r\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
