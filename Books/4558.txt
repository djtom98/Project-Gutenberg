So many years after the event\r\nwe cannot help wondering why the story was not earlier put in book form;\r\nfor in its delineation of the character of an adventurer it is as great\r\nas VANITY FAIR, while for the local colour of history, if I may put it\r\nso, it is no undistinguished precursor of ESMOND.\r\n\r\nIn the number of FRASER\xe2\x80\x99S MAGAZINE for January 1844 appeared the first\r\ninstalment of \xe2\x80\x98THE LUCK OF BARRY LYNDON, ESQ., A ROMANCE OF THE LAST\r\nCENTURY, by FitzBoodle,\xe2\x80\x99 and the story continued to appear month by\r\nmonth--with the exception of October--up to the end of the year, when\r\nthe concluding portion was signed \xe2\x80\x98G. S. FitzBoodle.\xe2\x80\x99 FITZBOODLE\xe2\x80\x99S\r\nCONFESSIONS, it should be added, had appeared occasionally in the\r\nmagazine during the years immediately precedent, so that the pseudonym\r\nwas familiar to FRASER\xe2\x80\x99S readers. The story was written, according to\r\nits author\xe2\x80\x99s own words, \xe2\x80\x98with a great deal of dulness, unwillingness and\r\nlabour,\xe2\x80\x99 and was evidently done as the instalments were required, for in\r\nAugust he wrote \xe2\x80\x98read for \xe2\x80\x9cB. L.\xe2\x80\x9d all the morning at the club,\xe2\x80\x99 and four\r\ndays later of \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cB. L.\xe2\x80\x9d lying like a nightmare on my mind.\xe2\x80\x99 The journey\r\nto the East--which was to give us in literary results NOTES OF A\r\nJOURNEY FROM CORNHILL TO GRAND CAIRO--was begun with BARRY LYNDON yet\r\nunfinished, for at Malta the author noted on the first three days of\r\nNovember--\xe2\x80\x98Wrote Barry but slowly and with great difficulty.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Wrote\r\nBarry with no more success than yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Finished Barry after great\r\nthroes late at night.\xe2\x80\x99 In the number of Fraser\xe2\x80\x99s for the following\r\nmonth, as I have said, the conclusion appeared. A dozen years later, in\r\n1856, the story formed the first part of the third volume of Thackeray\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMISCELLANIES, when it was called MEMOIRS OF BARRY LYNDON, ESQ., WRITTEN\r\nBY HIMSELF. Since then, it has nearly always been issued with other\r\nmatter, as though it were not strong enough to stand alone, or as though\r\nthe importance of a work was mainly to be gauged by the number of\r\npages to be crowded into one cover. The scheme of the present edition\r\nfortunately allows fitting honour to be done to the memoirs of the great\r\nadventurer.\r\n\r\nTo come from the story as a whole to the personality of the eponymous\r\nhero. Three widely-differing historical individuals are suggested as\r\nhaving contributed to the composite portrait. Best known of these was\r\nthat very prince among adventurers, G. J. Casanova de Seingalt, a man\r\nwho in the latter half of the eighteenth century played the part of\r\nadventurer--and generally that of the successful adventurer--in most of\r\nthe European capitals; who within the first five-and-twenty years of\r\nhis life had been \xe2\x80\x98abbe, secretary to Cardinal Aquaviva, ensign, and\r\nviolinist, at Rome, Constantinople, Corfu, and his own birthplace\r\n(Venice), where he cured a senator of apoplexy.\xe2\x80\x99 His autobiography,\r\nMEMOIRES ECRIT PAR LUI MEME (in twelve volumes), has been described\r\nas \xe2\x80\x98unmatched as a self-revelation of scoundrelism.\xe2\x80\x99 It has also\r\nbeen suggested, with I think far less colour of probability, that the\r\noriginal of Barry was the diplomatist and satiric poet Sir Charles\r\nHanbury Williams, whom Dr Johnson described as \xe2\x80\x98our lively and elegant\r\nthough too licentious lyrick bard.\xe2\x80\x99 The third original, and one who,\r\nthere cannot be the slightest doubt, contributed features to the great\r\nportrait, is a certain Andrew Robinson Stoney, afterwards Stoney-Bowes.\r\n\r\nThe original of the Countess Lyndon was Mary Eleanor Bowes, Dowager\r\nCountess of Strathmore, and heiress of a very wealthy Durham family.\r\nThis lady had many suitors, but in 1777 Stoney, a bankrupt lieutenant on\r\nhalf pay, who had fought a duel on her behalf, induced her to marry him,\r\nand subsequently hyphenated her name with his own. He became member\r\nof Parliament, and ran such extravagant courses as does Barry Lyndon,\r\ntreated his wife with similar barbarity, abducted her when she had\r\nescaped from him, and then, after being divorced, found his way to\r\na debtors\xe2\x80\x99 prison. There are similarities here which no seeker after\r\noriginals can overlook. Mrs Ritchie says that her father had a friend\r\nat Paris, \xe2\x80\x98a Mr Bowes, who may have first told him this history of which\r\nthe details are almost incredible, as quoted from the papers of the\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 The name of Thackeray\xe2\x80\x99s friend is a curious coincidence, unless,\r\nas may well have been the case, he was a connection of the family into\r\nwhich the notorious adventurer had married. It is not unlikely\r\nthat Thackeray had seen the work published in 1810--the year of\r\nStoney-Bowes\xe2\x80\x99s death--in which the whole unhappy romance was set forth.\r\nThis was \xe2\x80\x98THE LIVES OF ANDREW ROBINSON BOWES ESQ., and THE COUNTESS OF\r\nSTRATHMORE. Written from thirty-three years\xe2\x80\x99 Professional Attendance,\r\nfrom letters and other well authenticated Documents by Jesse Foot,\r\nSurgeon.\xe2\x80\x99 In this book we find several incidents similar to ones in\r\nthe story. Bowes cut down all the timber on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s estate, but\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the neighbours would not buy it.\xe2\x80\x99 Such practical jokes as Barry Lyndon\r\nplayed upon his son\xe2\x80\x99s tutor were played by Bowes on his chaplain. The\r\nstory of Stoney and his marriage will be found briefly given in the\r\nnotice of the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s life in the DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nWhence that part of the romantic interlude dealing with the stay in\r\nthe Duchy of X----, dealt with in chapter x., etc., was inspired,\r\nThackeray\xe2\x80\x99s own note\\books (as quoted by Mrs Ritchie) conclusively show:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98January 4,1844. Read in a silly book called L\xe2\x80\x99EMPIRE, a good story\r\nabout the first K. of Wurtemberg\xe2\x80\x99s wife; killed by her husband for\r\nadultery. Frederic William, born in 1734 (?), m. in 1780 the Princess\r\nCaroline of Brunswick Wolfenbuttel, who died the 27th September 1788.\r\nFor the rest of the story see L\xe2\x80\x99EMPIRE, OU DIX ANS SOUS NAPOLEON, PAR UN\r\nCHAMBELLAN: Paris, Allardin, 1836; vol. i. 220.\xe2\x80\x99 The \xe2\x80\x98Captain Freny\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nwhom Barry owed his adventures on his journey to Dublin (chapter iii.)\r\nwas a notorious highwayman, on whose doings Thackeray had enlarged in\r\nthe fifteenth chapter of his IRISH SKETCH BOOK.\r\n\r\nDespite the slowness with which it was written, and the seeming neglect\r\nwith which it was permitted to remain unreprinted, BARRY LYNDON was\r\nto be hailed by competent critics as one of Thackeray\xe2\x80\x99s finest\r\nperformances, though the author himself seems to have had no strong\r\nregard for the story. His daughter has recorded, \xe2\x80\x98My father once said\r\nto me when I was a girl: \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t read BARRY LYNDON, you won\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, it is scarcely a book to LIKE, but one to admire and to\r\nwonder at for its consummate power and mastery.\xe2\x80\x99 Another novelist,\r\nAnthony Trollope, has said of it: \xe2\x80\x98In imagination, language,\r\nconstruction, and general literary capacity, Thackeray never did\r\nanything more remarkable than BARRY LYNDON.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Leslie Stephen says:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All later critics have recognised in this book one of his most powerful\r\nperformances. In directness and vigour he never surpassed it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nW.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMOIRES OF BARRY LYNDON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. MY PEDIGREE AND FAMILY--UNDERGO THE INFLUENCE OF THE TENDER\r\nPASSION\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the days of Adam, there has been hardly a mischief done in this\r\nworld but a woman has been at the bottom of it. Ever since ours was\r\na family (and that must be very NEAR Adam\xe2\x80\x99s time,--so old, noble, and\r\nillustrious are the Barrys, as everybody knows) women have played a\r\nmighty part with the destinies of our race.\r\n\r\nI presume that there is no gentleman in Europe that has not heard of\r\nthe house of Barry of Barryogue, of the kingdom of Ireland, than which a\r\nmore famous name is not to be found in Gwillim or D\xe2\x80\x99Hozier; and though,\r\nas a man of the world, I have learned to despise heartily the claims\r\nof some PRETENDERS to high birth who have no more genealogy than the\r\nlacquey who cleans my boots, and though I laugh to utter scorn the\r\nboasting of many of my countrymen, who are all for descending from kings\r\nof Ireland, and talk of a domain no bigger than would feed a pig as if\r\nit were a principality; yet truth compels me to assert that my family\r\nwas the noblest of the island, and, perhaps, of the universal world;\r\nwhile their possessions, now insignificant and torn from us by war, by\r\ntreachery, by the loss of time, by ancestral extravagance, by adhesion\r\nto the old faith and monarch, were formerly prodigious, and embraced\r\nmany counties, at a time when Ireland was vastly more prosperous than\r\nnow. I would assume the Irish crown over my coat-of-arms, but that there\r\nare so many silly pretenders to that distinction who bear it and render\r\nit common.\r\n\r\nWho knows, but for the fault of a woman, I might have been wearing\r\nit now? You start with incredulity. I say, why not? Had there been a\r\ngallant chief to lead my countrymen, instead or puling knaves who bent\r\nthe knee to King Richard II., they might have been freemen; had there\r\nbeen a resolute leader to meet the murderous ruffian Oliver Cromwell, we\r\nshould have shaken off the English for ever. But there was no Barry in\r\nthe field against the usurper; on the contrary, my ancestor, Simon de\r\nBary, came over with the first-named monarch, and married the daughter\r\nof the then King of Munster, whose sons in battle he pitilessly slew.\r\n\r\nIn Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s time it was too late for a chief of the name of Barry\r\nto lift up his war-cry against that of the murderous brewer. We were\r\nprinces of the land no longer; our unhappy race had lost its possessions\r\na century previously, and by the most shameful treason. This I know to\r\nbe the fact, for my mother has often told me the story, and besides had\r\nworked it in a worsted pedigree which hung up in the yellow saloon at\r\nBarryville where we lived.\r\n\r\nThat very estate which the Lyndons now possess in Ireland was once the\r\nproperty of my race. Rory Barry of Barryogue owned it in Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime, and half Munster beside. The Barry was always in feud with the\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Mahonys in those times; and, as it happened, a certain English colonel\r\npassed through the former\xe2\x80\x99s country with a body of men-at-arms, on the\r\nvery day when the O\xe2\x80\x99Mahonys had made an inroad upon our territories, and\r\ncarried off a frightful plunder of our flocks and herds.\r\n\r\nThis young Englishman, whose name was Roger Lyndon, Linden, or Lyndaine,\r\nhaving been most hospitably received by the Barry, and finding him just\r\non the point of carrying an inroad into the O\xe2\x80\x99Mahonys\xe2\x80\x99 land, offered\r\nthe aid of himself and his lances, and behaved himself so well, as it\r\nappeared, that the O\xe2\x80\x99Mahonys were entirely overcome, all the Barrys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nproperty restored, and with it, says the old chronicle, twice as much of\r\nthe O\xe2\x80\x99Mahonys\xe2\x80\x99 goods and cattle.\r\n\r\nIt was the setting in of the winter season, and the young soldier was\r\npressed by the Barry not to quit his house of Barryogue, and remained\r\nthere during several months, his men being quartered with Barry\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ngallowglasses, man by man in the cottages round about. They conducted\r\nthemselves, as is their wont, with the most intolerable insolence\r\ntowards the Irish; so much so, that fights and murders continually\r\nensued, and the people vowed to destroy them.\r\n\r\nThe Barry\xe2\x80\x99s son (from whom I descend) was as hostile to the English as\r\nany other man on his domain; and, as they would not go when bidden, he\r\nand his friends consulted together and determined on destroying these\r\nEnglish to a man.\r\n\r\nBut they had let a woman into their plot, and this was the Barry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter. She was in love with the English Lyndon, and broke the whole\r\nsecret to him; and the dastardly English prevented the just massacre of\r\nthemselves by falling on the Irish, and destroying Phaudrig Barry, my\r\nancestor, and many hundreds of his men. The cross at Barrycross near\r\nCarrignadihioul is the spot where the odious butchery took place.\r\n\r\nLyndon married the daughter of Roderick Barry, and claimed the estate\r\nwhich he left: and though the descendants of Phaudrig were alive, as\r\nindeed they are in my person,[Footnote: As we have never been able to\r\nfind proofs of the marriage of my ancestor Phaudrig with his wife,\r\nI make no doubt that Lyndon destroyed the contract, and murdered the\r\npriest and witnesses of the marriage.--B. L.] on appealing to the\r\nEnglish courts, the estate was awarded to the Englishman, as has ever\r\nbeen the case where English and Irish were concerned.\r\n\r\nThus, had it not been for the weakness of a woman, I should have been\r\nborn to the possession of those very estates which afterwards came to me\r\nby merit, as you shall hear. But to proceed with my family, history.\r\n\r\nMy father was well known to the best circles in this kingdom, as in that\r\nof Ireland, under the name of Roaring Harry Barry. He was bred like many\r\nother young sons of genteel families to the profession of the law, being\r\narticled to a celebrated attorney of Sackville Street in the city of\r\nDublin; and, from his great genius and aptitude for learning, there is\r\nno doubt he would have made an eminent figure in his profession, had not\r\nhis social qualities, love of field-sports, and extraordinary graces\r\nof manner, marked him out for a higher sphere. While he was attorney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclerk he kept seven race-horses, and hunted regularly both with the\r\nKildare and Wicklow hunts; and rode on his grey horse Endymion that\r\nfamous match against Captain Punter, which is still remembered by lovers\r\nof the sport, and of which I caused a splendid picture to be made and\r\nhung over my dining-hall mantelpiece at Castle Lyndon. A year afterwards\r\nhe had the honour of riding that very horse Endymion before his late\r\nMajesty King George II. at New-market, and won the plate there and the\r\nattention of the august sovereign.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was only the second son of our family, my dear father came\r\nnaturally into the estate (now miserably reduced to L400 a year); for my\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son Cornelius Barry (called the Chevalier Borgne,\r\nfrom a wound which he received in Germany) remained constant to the old\r\nreligion in which our family was educated, and not only served abroad\r\nwith credit, but against His Most Sacred Majesty George II. in the\r\nunhappy Scotch disturbances in \xe2\x80\x9845. We shall hear more of the Chevalier\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nFor the conversion of my father I have to thank my dear mother, Miss\r\nBell Brady, daughter of Ulysses Brady of Castle Brady, county Kerry,\r\nEsquire and J.P. She was the most beautiful woman of her day in Dublin,\r\nand universally called the Dasher there. Seeing her at the assembly,\r\nmy father became passionately attached to her; but her soul was above\r\nmarrying a Papist or an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s clerk; and so, for the love of her,\r\nthe good old laws being then in force, my dear father slipped into my\r\nuncle Cornelius\xe2\x80\x99s shoes and took the family estate. Besides the force of\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s bright eyes, several persons, and of the genteelest society\r\ntoo, contributed to this happy change; and I have often heard my mother\r\nlaughingly tell the story of my father\xe2\x80\x99s recantation, which was solemnly\r\npronounced at the tavern in the company of Sir Dick Ringwood, Lord\r\nBagwig, Captain Punter, and two or three other young sparks of the\r\ntown. Roaring Harry won 300 pieces that very night at faro, and laid\r\nthe necessary information the next morning against his brother; but his\r\nconversion caused a coolness between him and my uncle Corney, who joined\r\nthe rebels in consequence.\r\n\r\nThis great difficulty being settled, my Lord Bagwig lent my father his\r\nown yacht, then lying at the Pigeon House, and the handsome Bell Brady\r\nwas induced to run away with him to England, although her parents\r\nwere against the match, and her lovers (as I have heard her tell many\r\nthousands of times) were among the most numerous and the most wealthy\r\nin all the kingdom of Ireland. They were married at the Savoy, and my\r\ngrandfather dying very soon, Harry Barry, Esquire, took possession of\r\nhis paternal property and supported our illustrious name with credit in\r\nLondon. He pinked the famous Count Tiercelin behind Montague House, he\r\nwas a member of \xe2\x80\x98White\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 and a frequenter of all the chocolate-houses;\r\nand my mother, likewise, made no small figure. At length, after his\r\ngreat day of triumph before His Sacred Majesty at Newmarket, Harry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfortune was just on the point of being made, for the gracious monarch\r\npromised to provide for him. But alas! he was taken in charge by another\r\nmonarch, whose will have no delay or denial,--by Death, namely, who\r\nseized upon my father at Chester races, leaving me a helpless orphan.\r\nPeace be to his ashes! He was not faultless, and dissipated all our\r\nprincely family property; but he was as brave a fellow as ever tossed\r\na bumper or called a main, and he drove his coach-and-six like a man of\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether His gracious Majesty was much affected by this\r\nsudden demise of my father, though my mother says he shed some royal\r\ntears on the occasion. But they helped us to nothing: and all that was\r\nfound in the house for the wife and creditors was a purse of ninety\r\nguineas, which my dear mother naturally took, with the family plate, and\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe and her own; and putting them into our great coach,\r\ndrove off to Holyhead, whence she took shipping for Ireland. My father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbody accompanied us in the finest hearse and plumes money could buy; for\r\nthough the husband and wife had quarrelled repeatedly in life, yet at my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death his high-spirited widow forgot all her differences, gave\r\nhim the grandest funeral that had been seen for many a day, and erected\r\na monument over his remains (for which I subsequently paid), which\r\ndeclared him to be the wisest, purest, and most affectionate of men.\r\n\r\nIn performing these sad duties over her deceased lord, the widow spent\r\nalmost every guinea she had, and, indeed, would have spent a great deal\r\nmore, had she discharged one-third of the demands which the ceremonies\r\noccasioned. But the people around our old house of Barryogue, although\r\nthey did not like my father for his change of faith, yet stood by him at\r\nthis moment, and were for exterminating the mutes sent by Mr. Plumer of\r\nLondon with the lamented remains. The monument and vault in the church\r\nwere then, alas! all that remained of my vast possessions; for my father\r\nhad sold every stick of the property to one Notley, an attorney, and we\r\nreceived but a cold welcome in his house--a miserable old tumble-down\r\nplace it was. [Footnote: In another part of his memoir Mr. Barry will\r\nbe found to describe this mansion as one of the most splendid palaces\r\nin Europe; but this is a practice not unusual with his nation; and with\r\nrespect to the Irish principality claimed by him, it is known that Mr.\r\nBarry\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather was an attorney and maker of his own fortune.]\r\n\r\nThe splendour of the funeral did not fail to increase the widow Barry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreputation as a woman of spirit and fashion; and when she wrote to her\r\nbrother Michael Brady, that worthy gentleman immediately rode across the\r\ncountry to fling himself in her arms, and to invite her in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname to Castle Brady.\r\n\r\nMick and Barry had quarrelled, as all men will, and very high words had\r\npassed between them during Barry\xe2\x80\x99s courtship of Miss Bell. When he took\r\nher off, Brady swore he would never forgive Barry or Bell; but coming\r\nto London in the year \xe2\x80\x9846, he fell in once more with Roaring Harry, and\r\nlived in his fine house in Clarges Street, and lost a few pieces to\r\nhim at play, and broke a watchman\xe2\x80\x99s head or two in his company,--all\r\nof which reminiscences endeared Bell and her son very much to the\r\ngood-hearted gentleman, and he received us both with open arms. Mrs.\r\nBarry did not, perhaps wisely, at first make known to her friends what\r\nwas her condition; but arriving in a huge gilt coach with enormous\r\narmorial bearings, was taken by her sister-in-law and the rest of the\r\ncounty for a person of considerable property and distinction. For a\r\ntime, then, and as was right and proper, Mrs. Barry gave the law at\r\nCastle Brady. She ordered the servants to and fro, and taught them,\r\nwhat indeed they much wanted, a little London neatness; and \xe2\x80\x98English\r\nRedmond,\xe2\x80\x99 as I was called, was treated like a little lord, and had a\r\nmaid and a footman to himself; and honest Mick paid their wages,--which\r\nwas much more than he was used to do for his own domestics,--doing\r\nall in his power to make his sister decently comfortable under her\r\nafflictions. Mamma, in return, determined that, when her affairs were\r\narranged, she would make her kind brother a handsome allowance for\r\nher son\xe2\x80\x99s maintenance and her own; and promised to have her handsome\r\nfurniture brought over from Clarges Street to adorn the somewhat\r\ndilapidated rooms of Castle Brady.\r\n\r\nBut it turned out that the rascally landlord seized upon every chair and\r\ntable that ought by rights to have belonged to the widow. The estate to\r\nwhich I was heir was in the hands of rapacious creditors; and the only\r\nmeans of subsistence remaining to the widow and child was a rent-charge\r\nof L50 upon my Lord Bagwig\xe2\x80\x99s property, who had many turf-dealings with\r\nthe deceased. And so my dear mother\xe2\x80\x99s liberal intentions towards her\r\nbrother were of course never fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, very much to the discredit of Mrs. Brady of Castle\r\nBrady, that when her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s poverty was thus made manifest,\r\nshe forgot all the respect which she had been accustomed to pay her,\r\ninstantly turned my maid and man-servant out of doors, and told Mrs.\r\nBarry that she might follow them as soon as she chose. Mrs. Mick was of\r\na low family, and a sordid way of thinking; and after about a couple\r\nof years (during which she had saved almost all her little income) the\r\nwidow complied with Madam Brady\xe2\x80\x99s desire. At the same time, giving way\r\nto a just though prudently dissimulated resentment, she made a vow that\r\nshe would never enter the gates of Castle Brady while the lady of the\r\nhouse remained alive within them.\r\n\r\nShe fitted up her new abode with much economy and considerable taste,\r\nand never, for all her poverty, abated a jot of the dignity which was\r\nher due and which all the neighbourhood awarded to her. How, indeed,\r\ncould they refuse respect to a lady who had lived in London, frequented\r\nthe most fashionable society there, and had been presented (as she\r\nsolemnly declared) at Court? These advantages gave her a right which\r\nseems to be pretty unsparingly exercised in Ireland by those natives who\r\nhave it,--the right of looking down with scorn upon all persons who have\r\nnot had the opportunity of quitting the mother-country and inhabiting\r\nEngland for a while. Thus, whenever Madam Brady appeared abroad in a\r\nnew dress, her sister-in-law would say, \xe2\x80\x98Poor creature! how can it\r\nbe expected that she should know anything of the fashion?\xe2\x80\x99 And though\r\npleased to be called the handsome widow, as she was, Mrs. Barry was\r\nstill better pleased to be called the English widow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brady, for her part, was not slow to reply: she used to say\r\nthat the defunct Barry was a bankrupt and a beggar; and as for the\r\nfashionable society which he saw, he saw it from my Lord Bagwig\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside-table, whose flatterer and hanger-on he was known to be. Regarding\r\nMrs. Barry, the lady of Castle Brady would make insinuations still more\r\npainful. However, why should we allude to these charges, or rake up\r\nprivate scandal of a hundred years old? It was in the reign of George\r\nII that the above-named personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad,\r\nhandsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now; and do not the\r\nSunday papers and the courts of law supply us every week with more novel\r\nand interesting slander?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it must be allowed that Mrs. Barry, after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath and her retirement, lived in such a way as to defy slander. For\r\nwhereas Bell Brady had been the gayest girl in the whole county of\r\nWexford, with half the bachelors at her feet, and plenty of smiles and\r\nencouragement for every one of them, Bell Barry adopted a dignified\r\nreserve that almost amounted to pomposity, and was as starch as any\r\nQuakeress. Many a man renewed his offers to the widow, who had been\r\nsmitten by the charms of the spinster; but Mrs. Barry refused all offers\r\nof marriage, declaring that she lived now for her son only, and for the\r\nmemory of her departed saint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Saint forsooth!\xe2\x80\x99 said ill-natured Mrs. Brady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harry Barry was as big a sinner as ever was known; and \xe2\x80\x98tis notorious\r\nthat he and Bell hated each other. If she won\xe2\x80\x99t marry now, depend on it,\r\nthe artful woman has a husband in her eye for all that, and only waits\r\nuntil Lord Bagwig is a widower.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd suppose she did, what then? Was not the widow of a Barry fit to\r\nmarry with any lord of England? and was it not always said that a woman\r\nwas to restore the fortunes of the Barry family? If my mother fancied\r\nthat SHE was to be that woman, I think it was a perfectly justifiable\r\nnotion on her part; for the Earl (my godfather) was always most\r\nattentive to her: I never knew how deeply this notion of advancing my\r\ninterests in the world had taken possession of mamma\xe2\x80\x99s mind, until\r\nhis Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s marriage in the year \xe2\x80\x9857 with Miss Goldmore, the Indian\r\nnabob\xe2\x80\x99s rich daughter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we continued to reside at Barryville, and, considering the\r\nsmallness of our income, kept up a wonderful state. Of the half-dozen\r\nfamilies that formed the congregation at Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town, there was not a\r\nsingle person whose appearance was so respectable as that of the widow,\r\nwho, though she always dressed in mourning, in memory of her deceased\r\nhusband, took care that her garments should be made so as to set off her\r\nhandsome person to the greatest advantage; and, indeed, I think,\r\nspent six hours out of every day in the week in cutting, trimming,\r\nand altering them to the fashion. She had the largest of hoops and the\r\nhandsomest of furbelows, and once a month (under my Lord Bagwig\xe2\x80\x99s cover)\r\nwould come a letter from London containing the newest accounts of the\r\nfashions there. Her complexion was so brilliant that she had no call to\r\nuse rouge, as was the mode in those days. No, she left red and white,\r\nshe said (and hence the reader may imagine how the two ladies hated each\r\nother) to Madam Brady, whose yellow complexion no plaster could alter.\r\nIn a word, she was so accomplished a beauty, that all the women in the\r\ncountry took pattern by her, and the young fellows from ten miles round\r\nwould ride over to Castle Brady church to have the sight of her.\r\n\r\nBut if (like every other woman that ever I saw or read of) she was proud\r\nof her beauty, to do her justice she was still more proud of her son,\r\nand has said a thousand times to me that I was the handsomest young\r\nfellow in the world. This is a matter of taste. A man of sixty may,\r\nhowever, say what he was at fourteen without much vanity, and I must say\r\nI think there was some cause for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. The good soul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npleasure was to dress me; and on Sundays and holidays I turned out in a\r\nvelvet coat with a silver-hilted sword by my side and a gold garter at\r\nmy knee, as fine as any lord in the land. My mother worked me several\r\nmost splendid waistcoats, and I had plenty of lace for my ruffles, and\r\na fresh riband to my hair, and as we walked to church on Sundays, even\r\nenvious Mrs. Brady was found to allow that there was not a prettier pair\r\nin the kingdom.\r\n\r\nOf course, too, the lady of Castle Brady used to sneer, because on these\r\noccasions a certain Tim, who used to be called my valet, followed me and\r\nmy mother to church, carrying a huge prayer-book and a cane, and dressed\r\nin the livery of one of our own fine footmen from Clarges Street, which,\r\nas Tim was a bandy-shanked little fellow, did not exactly become him.\r\nBut, though poor, we were gentlefolks, and not to be sneered out of\r\nthese becoming appendages to our rank; and so would march up the aisle\r\nto our pew with as much state and gravity as the Lord Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s lady\r\nand son might do. When there, my mother would give the responses and\r\namens in a loud dignified voice that was delightful to hear, and,\r\nbesides, had a fine loud voice for singing, which art she had perfected\r\nin London under a fashionable teacher; and she would exercise her talent\r\nin such a way that you would hardly hear any other voice of the little\r\ncongregation which chose to join in the psalm. In fact, my mother had\r\ngreat gifts in every way, and believed herself to be one of the most\r\nbeautiful, accomplished, and meritorious persons in the world. Often and\r\noften has she talked to me and the neighbours regarding her own humility\r\nand piety, pointing them out in such a way that I would defy the most\r\nobstinate to disbelieve her.\r\n\r\nWhen we left Castle Brady we came to occupy a house in Brady\xe2\x80\x99s town,\r\nwhich mamma christened Barryville. I confess it was but a small place,\r\nbut, indeed, we made the most of it. I have mentioned the family\r\npedigree which hung up in the drawingroom, which mamma called the yellow\r\nsaloon, and my bedroom was called the pink bedroom, and hers the orange\r\ntawny apartment (how well I remember them all!); and at dinner-time Tim\r\nregularly rang a great bell, and we each had a silver tankard to drink\r\nfrom, and mother boasted with justice that I had as good a bottle of\r\nclaret by my side as any squire of the land. So indeed I had, but I was\r\nnot, of course, allowed at my tender years to drink any of the wine;\r\nwhich thus attained a considerable age, even in the decanter.\r\n\r\nUncle Brady (in spite of the family quarrel) found out the above fact\r\none day by calling at Barryville at dinner-time, and unluckily tasting\r\nthe liquor. You should have seen how he sputtered and made faces! But\r\nthe honest gentleman was not particular about his wine, or the company\r\nin which he drank it. He would get drunk, indeed, with the parson or the\r\npriest indifferently; with the latter, much to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s indignation,\r\nfor, as a true blue Nassauite, she heartily despised all those of the\r\nold faith, and would scarcely sit down in the room with a benighted\r\nPapist. But the squire had no such scruples; he was, indeed, one of the\r\neasiest, idlest, and best-natured fellows that ever lived, and many\r\nan hour would he pass with the lonely widow when he was tired of Madam\r\nBrady at home. He liked me, he said, as much as one of his own sons,\r\nand at length, after the widow had held out for a couple of years, she\r\nagreed to allow me to return to the castle; though, for herself,\r\nshe resolutely kept the oath which she had made with regard to her\r\nsister-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe very first day I returned to Castle Brady my trials may be said,\r\nin a manner, to have begun. My cousin, Master Mick, a huge monster of\r\nnineteen (who hated me, and I promise you I returned the compliment),\r\ninsulted me at dinner about my mother\xe2\x80\x99s poverty, and made all the girls\r\nof the family titter. So when we went to the stables, whither Mick\r\nalways went for his pipe of tobacco after dinner, I told him a piece of\r\nmy mind, and there was a fight for at least ten minutes, during which I\r\nstood to him like a man, and blacked his left eye, though I was myself\r\nonly twelve years old at the time. Of course he beat me, but a beating\r\nmakes only a small impression on a lad of that tender age, as I had\r\nproved many times in battles with the ragged Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town boys before,\r\nnot one of whom, at my time of life, was my match. My uncle was very\r\nmuch pleased when he heard of my gallantry; my cousin Nora brought brown\r\npaper and vinegar for my nose, and I went home that night with a pint of\r\nclaret under my girdle, not a little proud, let me tell you, at having\r\nheld my own against Mick so long.\r\n\r\nAnd though he persisted in his bad treatment of me, and used to cane\r\nme whenever I fell in his way, yet I was very happy now at Castle\r\nBrady with the company there, and my cousins, or some of them, and the\r\nkindness of my uncle, with whom I became a prodigious favourite. He\r\nbought a colt for me, and taught me to ride. He took me out coursing and\r\nfowling, and instructed me to shoot flying. And at length I was released\r\nfrom Mick\xe2\x80\x99s persecution, for his brother, Master Ulick, returning from\r\nTrinity College, and hating his elder brother, as is mostly the way in\r\nfamilies of fashion, took me under his protection; and from that time,\r\nas Ulick was a deal bigger and stronger than Mick, I, English Redmond,\r\nas I was called, was left alone; except when the former thought fit to\r\nthrash me, which he did whenever he thought proper.\r\n\r\nNor was my learning neglected in the ornamental parts, for I had\r\nan uncommon natural genius for many things, and soon topped in\r\naccomplishments most of the persons around me. I had a quick ear and a\r\nfine voice, which my mother cultivated to the best of her power, and\r\nshe taught me to step a minuet gravely and gracefully, and thus laid\r\nthe foundation of my future success in life. The common dances I learned\r\n(as, perhaps, I ought not to confess) in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, which,\r\nyou may be sure, was never without a piper, and where I was considered\r\nunrivalled both at a hornpipe and a jig.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of book-learning, I had always an uncommon taste for\r\nreading plays and novels, as the best part of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s polite\r\neducation, and never let a pedlar pass the village, if I had a penny,\r\nwithout having a ballad or two from him. As for your dull grammar,\r\nand Greek and Latin and stuff, I have always hated them from my youth\r\nupwards, and said, very unmistakably, I would have none of them.\r\n\r\nThis I proved pretty clearly at the age of thirteen, when my aunt Biddy\r\nBrady\xe2\x80\x99s legacy of L100 came in to mamma, who thought to employ the sum\r\non my education, and sent me to Doctor Tobias Tickler\xe2\x80\x99s famous academy\r\nat Ballywhacket--Backwhacket, as my uncle used to call it. But six\r\nweeks after I had been consigned to his reverence, I suddenly made my\r\nappearance again at Castle Brady, having walked forty miles from the\r\nodious place, and left the Doctor in a state near upon apoplexy. The\r\nfact was, that at taw, prison-bars, or boxing, I was at the head of the\r\nschool, but could not be brought to excel in the classics; and after\r\nhaving been flogged seven times, without its doing me the least good\r\nin my Latin, I refused to submit altogether (finding it useless) to an\r\neighth application of the rod. \xe2\x80\x98Try some other way, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, when\r\nhe was for horsing me once more; but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; whereon, and to defend\r\nmyself, I flung a slate at him, and knocked down a Scotch usher with a\r\nleaden inkstand. All the lads huzza\xe2\x80\x99d at this, and some or the servants\r\nwanted to stop me; but taking out a large clasp-knife that my cousin\r\nNora had given me, I swore I would plunge it into the waistcoat of the\r\nfirst man who dared to balk me, and faith they let me pass on. I slept\r\nthat night twenty miles off Ballywhacket, at the house of a cottier, who\r\ngave me potatoes and milk, and to whom I gave a hundred guineas after,\r\nwhen I came to visit Ireland in my days of greatness. I wish I had the\r\nmoney now. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of regret? I have had many a harder bed\r\nthan that I shall sleep on to-night, and many a scantier meal than\r\nhonest Phil Murphy gave me on the evening I ran away from school. So six\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x99 was all the schooling I ever got. And I say this to let parents\r\nknow the value of it; for though I have met more learned book-worms in\r\nthe world, especially a great hulking, clumsy, blear-eyed old doctor,\r\nwhom they called Johnson, and who lived in a court off Fleet Street,\r\nin London, yet I pretty soon silenced him in an argument (at \xe2\x80\x98Button\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCoffeehouse\xe2\x80\x99); and in that, and in poetry, and what I call natural\r\nphilosophy, or the science of life, and in riding, music, leaping,\r\nthe small-sword, the knowledge of a horse, or a main of cocks, and the\r\nmanners of an accomplished gentleman and a man of fashion, I may say for\r\nmyself that Redmond Barry has seldom found his equal. \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to\r\nMr. Johnson, on the occasion I allude to--he was accompanied by a Mr.\r\nBuswell of Scotland, and I was presented to the club by a Mr. Goldsmith,\r\na countryman of my own--\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, in reply to the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat thundering quotation in Greek, \xe2\x80\x98you fancy you know a great deal\r\nmore than me, because you quote your Aristotle and your Pluto; but can\r\nyou tell me which horse will win at Epsom Downs next week?--Can you run\r\nsix miles without breathing?--Can you shoot the ace of spades ten times\r\nwithout missing? If so, talk about Aristotle and Pluto to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98D\xe2\x80\x99ye knaw who ye\xe2\x80\x99re speaking to?\xe2\x80\x99 roared out the Scotch gentleman, Mr.\r\nBoswell, at this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old schoolmaster. \xe2\x80\x98I had no\r\nright to brag of my Greek to the gentleman, and he has answered me very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctor,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, looking waggishly at him, \xe2\x80\x98do you know ever a rhyme\r\nfor ArisTOTLE?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Port, if you plaise,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr. Goldsmith, laughing. And we had SIX\r\nRHYMES FOR ARISTOTLE before we left the coffee-house that evening. It\r\nbecame a regular joke afterwards when I told the story, and at \xe2\x80\x98White\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99\r\nor the \xe2\x80\x98Cocoa-tree\xe2\x80\x99 you would hear the wags say, \xe2\x80\x98Waiter, bring me one\r\nof Captain Barry\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes for Aristotle.\xe2\x80\x99 Once, when I was in liquor at\r\nthe latter place, young Dick Sheridan called me a great Staggerite, a\r\njoke which I could never understand. But I am wandering from my story,\r\nand must get back to home, and dear old Ireland again.\r\n\r\nI have made acquaintance with the best in the land since, and my\r\nmanners are such, I have said, as to make me the equal of them all; and,\r\nperhaps, you will wonder how a country boy, as I was, educated amongst\r\nIrish squires, and their dependants of the stable and farm, should\r\narrive at possessing such elegant manners as I was indisputably allowed\r\nto have. I had, the fact is, a very valuable instructor in the person of\r\nan old gamekeeper, who had served the French king at Fontenoy, and who\r\ntaught me the dances and customs, and a smattering of the language of\r\nthat country, with the use of the sword, both small and broad. Many\r\nand many a long mile I have trudged by his side as a lad, he telling me\r\nwonderful stories of the French king, and the Irish brigade, and Marshal\r\nSaxe, and the opera-dancers; he knew my uncle, too, the Chevalier\r\nBorgne, and indeed had a thousand accomplishments which he taught me in\r\nsecret. I never knew a man like him for making or throwing a fly, for\r\nphysicking a horse, or breaking, or choosing one; he taught me manly\r\nsports, from birds\xe2\x80\x99-nesting upwards, and I always shall consider Phil\r\nPurcell as the very best tutor I could have had. His fault was drink,\r\nbut for that I have always had a blind eye; and he hated my cousin Mick\r\nlike poison; but I could excuse him that too.\r\n\r\nWith Phil, and at the age of fifteen, I was a more accomplished man than\r\neither of my cousins; and I think Nature had been also more bountiful to\r\nme in the matter of person. Some of the Castle Brady girls (as you shall\r\nhear presently) adored me. At fairs and races many of the prettiest\r\nlasses present said they would like to have me for their bachelor; and\r\nyet somehow, it must be confessed, I was not popular.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, every one knew I was bitter poor; and I think,\r\nperhaps, it was my good mother\xe2\x80\x99s fault that I was bitter proud too. I\r\nhad a habit of boasting in company of my birth, and the splendour of my\r\ncarriages, gardens, cellars, and domestics, and this before people who\r\nwere perfectly aware of my real circumstances. If it was boys, and they\r\nventured to sneer, I would beat them, or die for it; and many\xe2\x80\x99s the time\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been brought home well-nigh killed by one or more of them, on what,\r\nwhen my mother asked me, I would say was \xe2\x80\x98a family quarrel.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Support\r\nyour name with your blood, Reddy my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 would that saint say, with the\r\ntears in her eyes; and so would she herself have done with her voice,\r\nay, and her teeth and nails.\r\n\r\nThus, at fifteen, there was scarce a lad of twenty, for half-a-dozen\r\nmiles round, that I had not beat for one cause or other. There were the\r\nvicar\xe2\x80\x99s two sons of Castle Brady--in course I could not associate with\r\nsuch beggarly brats as them, and many a battle did we have as to\r\nwho should take the wall in Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town; there was Pat Lurgan, the\r\nblacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s son, who had the better of me four times before we came\r\nto the crowning fight, when I overcame him; and I could mention a score\r\nmore of my deeds of prowess in that way, but that fisticuff facts are\r\ndull subjects to talk of, and to discuss before high-bred gentlemen and\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is another subject, ladies, on which I must discourse,\r\nand THAT is never out of place. Day and night you like to hear of it:\r\nyoung and old, you dream and think of it. Handsome and ugly (and, faith,\r\nbefore fifty, I never saw such a thing as a plain woman), it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsubject next to the hearts of all of you; and I think you guess my\r\nriddle without more trouble. LOVE! sure the word is formed on purpose\r\nout of the prettiest soft vowels and consonants in the language, and\r\nhe or she who does not care to read about it is not worth a fig, to my\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nMy uncle\xe2\x80\x99s family consisted of ten children; who, as is the custom in\r\nsuch large families, were divided into two camps, or parties; the one\r\nsiding with their mamma, the other taking the part of my uncle in all\r\nthe numerous quarrels which arose between that gentleman and his lady.\r\nMrs. Brady\xe2\x80\x99s faction was headed by Mick, the eldest son, who hated me\r\nso, and disliked his father for keeping him out of his property: while\r\nUlick, the second brother, was his father\xe2\x80\x99s own boy; and, in revenge,\r\nMaster Mick was desperately afraid of him. I need not mention the girls\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnames; I had plague enough with them in after-life, Heaven knows; and\r\none of them was the cause of all my early troubles: this was (though to\r\nbe sure all her sisters denied it) the belle of the family, Miss Honoria\r\nBrady by name.\r\n\r\nShe said she was only nineteen at the time; but I could read the\r\nfly-leaf in the family Bible as well as another (it was one of the three\r\nbooks which, with the backgammon-board, formed my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s library), and\r\nknow that she was born in the year \xe2\x80\x9837, and christened by Doctor Swift,\r\nDean of St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s, Dublin: hence she was three-and-twenty years old\r\nat the time she and I were so much together.\r\n\r\nWhen I come to think about her now, I know she never could have been\r\nhandsome; for her figure was rather of the fattest, and her mouth of the\r\nwidest; she was freckled over like a partridge\xe2\x80\x99s egg, and her hair was\r\nthe colour of a certain vegetable which we eat with boiled beef, to\r\nuse the mildest term. Often and often would my dear mother make these\r\nremarks concerning her; but I did not believe them then, and somehow\r\nhad gotten to think Honoria an angelical being, far above all the other\r\nangels of her sex.\r\n\r\nAnd as we know very well that a lady who is skilled in dancing or\r\nsinging never can perfect herself without a deal of study in private,\r\nand that the song or the minuet which is performed with so much graceful\r\nease in the assembly-room has not been acquired without vast labour\r\nand perseverance in private; so it is with the dear creatures who are\r\nskilled in coquetting. Honoria, for instance, was always practising,\r\nand she would take poor me to rehearse her accomplishment upon; or the\r\nexciseman, when he came his rounds, or the steward, or the poor curate,\r\nor the young apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s lad from Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town: whom I recollect\r\nbeating once for that very reason. If he is alive now I make him my\r\napologies. Poor fellow! as if it was HIS fault that he should be a\r\nvictim to the wiles of one of the greatest coquettes (considering her\r\nobscure life and rustic breeding) in the world.\r\n\r\nIf the truth must be told--and every word of this narrative of my life\r\nis of the most sacred veracity--my passion for Nora began in a very\r\nvulgar and unromantic way. I did not save her life; on the contrary, I\r\nonce very nearly killed her, as you shall hear. I did not behold her\r\nby moonlight playing on the guitar, or rescue her from the hands of\r\nruffians, as Alfonso does Lindamira in the novel; but one day, after\r\ndinner at Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town, in summer, going into the garden to pull\r\ngooseberries for my dessert, and thinking only of gooseberries, I pledge\r\nmy honour, I came upon Miss Nora and one of her sisters, with whom\r\nshe was friends at the time, who were both engaged in the very same\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the Latin for gooseberry, Redmond?\xe2\x80\x99 says she. She was always\r\n\xe2\x80\x98poking her fun,\xe2\x80\x99 as the Irish phrase it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know the Latin for goose,\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 cries Miss Mysie, as pert as a peacock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bo to you!\xe2\x80\x99 says I (for I had never a want of wit); and so we fell to\r\nwork at the gooseberry-bush, laughing and talking as happy as might be.\r\nIn the course of our diversion Nora managed to scratch her arm, and it\r\nbled, and she screamed, and it was mighty round and white, and I tied it\r\nup, and I believe was permitted to kiss her hand; and though it was as\r\nbig and clumsy a hand as ever you saw, yet I thought the favour the\r\nmost ravishing one that was ever conferred upon me, and went home in a\r\nrapture.\r\n\r\nI was much too simple a fellow to disguise any sentiment I chanced to\r\nfeel in those days; and not one of the eight Castle Brady girls but\r\nwas soon aware of my passion, and joked and complimented Nora about her\r\nbachelor.\r\n\r\nThe torments of jealousy the cruel coquette made me endure were\r\nhorrible. Sometimes she would treat me as a child, sometimes as a man.\r\nShe would always leave me if ever there came a stranger to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For after all, Redmond,\xe2\x80\x99 she would say, \xe2\x80\x98you are but fifteen, and you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t a guinea in the world.\xe2\x80\x99 At which I would swear that I would\r\nbecome the greatest hero ever known out of Ireland, and vow that before\r\nI was twenty I would have money enough to purchase an estate six times\r\nas big as Castle Brady. All which vain promises, of course, I did not\r\nkeep; but I make no doubt they influenced me in my very early life, and\r\ncaused me to do those great actions for which I have been celebrated,\r\nand which shall be narrated presently in order.\r\n\r\nI must tell one of them, just that my dear young lady readers may\r\nknow what sort of a fellow Redmond Barry was, and what a courage and\r\nundaunted passion he had. I question whether any of the jenny-jessamines\r\nof the present day would do half as much in the face of danger.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, it must be premised, the United Kingdom was in a state\r\nof great excitement from the threat generally credited of a French\r\ninvasion. The Pretender was said to be in high favour at Versailles,\r\na descent upon Ireland was especially looked to, and the noblemen and\r\npeople of condition in that and all other parts of the kingdom showed\r\ntheir loyalty by raising regiments of horse and foot to resist the\r\ninvaders. Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town sent a company to join the Kilwangan regiment, of\r\nwhich Master Mick was the captain; and we had a letter from Master\r\nUlick at Trinity College, stating that the University had also formed a\r\nregiment, in which he had the honour to be a corporal. How I envied\r\nthem both! especially that odious Mick as I saw him in his laced scarlet\r\ncoat, with a ribbon in his hat, march off at the head of his men. He,\r\nthe poor spiritless creature, was a captain, and I nothing,--I who felt\r\nI had as much courage as the Duke of Cumberland himself, and felt, too,\r\nthat a red jacket would mightily become me! My mother said I was too\r\nyoung to join the new regiment; but the fact was, that it was she\r\nherself who was too poor, for the cost of a new uniform would have\r\nswallowed up half her year\xe2\x80\x99s income, and she would only have her boy\r\nappear in a way suitable to his birth, riding the finest of racers,\r\ndressed in the best of clothes, and keeping the genteelest of company.\r\n\r\nWell, then, the whole country was alive with war\xe2\x80\x99s alarums, the three\r\nkingdoms ringing with military music, and every man of merit paying his\r\ndevoirs at the court of Bellona, whilst poor I was obliged to stay at\r\nhome in my fustian jacket and sigh for fame in secret. Mr. Mick came\r\nto and fro from the regiment, and brought numerous of his comrades with\r\nhim. Their costume and swaggering airs filled me with grief, and Miss\r\nNora\xe2\x80\x99s unvarying attentions to them served to make me half wild. No one,\r\nhowever, thought of attributing this sadness to the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscore, but rather to my disappointment at not being allowed to join the\r\nmilitary profession.\r\n\r\nOnce the officers of the Fencibles gave a grand ball at Kilwangan, to\r\nwhich, as a matter of course, all the ladies of Castle Brady (and a\r\npretty ugly coachful they were) were invited. I knew to what tortures\r\nthe odious little flirt of a Nora would put me with her eternal\r\ncoquetries with the officers, and refused for a long time to be one of\r\nthe party to the ball. But she had a way of conquering me, against which\r\nall resistance of mine was in vain. She vowed that riding in a coach\r\nalways made her ill. \xe2\x80\x98And how can I go to the ball,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98unless\r\nyou take me on Daisy behind you on the pillion?\xe2\x80\x99 Daisy was a good\r\nblood-mare of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, and to such a proposition I could not for my\r\nsoul say no; so we rode in safety to Kilwangan, and I felt myself as\r\nproud as any prince when she promised to dance a country-dance with me.\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was ended, the little ungrateful flirt informed me that\r\nshe had quite forgotten her engagement; she had actually danced the set\r\nwith an Englishman! I have endured torments in my life, but none like\r\nthat. She tried to make up for her neglect, but I would not. Some of the\r\nprettiest girls there offered to console me, for I was the best dancer\r\nin the room. I made one attempt, but was too wretched to continue, and\r\nso remained alone all night in a state of agony. I would have played,\r\nbut I had no money; only the gold piece that my mother bade me always\r\nkeep in my purse as a gentleman should. I did not care for drink, or\r\nknow the dreadful comfort of it in those days; but I thought of killing\r\nmyself and Nora, and most certainly of making away with Captain Quin!\r\n\r\nAt last, and at morning, the ball was over. The rest of our ladies went\r\noff in the lumbering creaking old coach; Daisy was brought out, and Miss\r\nNora took her place behind me, which I let her do without a word. But we\r\nwere not half-a-mile out of town when she began to try with her coaxing\r\nand blandishments to dissipate my ill-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a bitter night, Redmond dear, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch cold without a\r\nhandkerchief to your neck.\xe2\x80\x99 To this sympathetic remark from the pillion,\r\nthe saddle made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you and Miss Clancy have a pleasant evening, Redmond? You were\r\ntogether, I saw, all night.\xe2\x80\x99 To this the saddle only replied by grinding\r\nhis teeth, and giving a lash to Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O mercy! you\xe2\x80\x99ll make Daisy rear and throw me, you careless creature\r\nyou: and you know, Redmond, I\xe2\x80\x99m so timid.\xe2\x80\x99 The pillion had by this\r\ngot her arm round the saddle\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and perhaps gave it the gentlest\r\nsqueeze in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!\xe2\x80\x99 answers the saddle; \xe2\x80\x98and I only\r\ndanced with her because--because--the person with whom I intended to\r\ndance chose to be engaged the whole night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure there were my sisters,\xe2\x80\x99 said the pillion, now laughing outright in\r\nthe pride of her conscious superiority; \xe2\x80\x98and for me, my dear, I had\r\nnot been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single\r\nset.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Quin?\xe2\x80\x99 said I; and\r\noh! strange delicious charm of coquetry, I do believe Miss Nora Brady\r\nat twenty-three years of age felt a pang of delight in thinking that she\r\nhad so much power over a guileless lad of fifteen. Of course she replied\r\nthat she did not care a fig for Captain Quin: that he danced prettily,\r\nto be sure, and was a pleasant rattle of a man; that he looked well in\r\nhis regimentals too; and if he chose to ask her to dance, how could she\r\nrefuse him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you refused me, Nora.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I can dance with you any day,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Miss Nora, with a toss\r\nof her head; \xe2\x80\x98and to dance with your cousin at a ball, looks as if you\r\ncould find no other partner. Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 said Nora--and this was a\r\ncruel, unkind cut, which showed what a power she had over me, and how\r\nmercilessly she used it,--\xe2\x80\x98besides, Redmond, Captain Quin\xe2\x80\x99s a man and\r\nyou are only a boy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If ever I meet him again,\xe2\x80\x99 I roared out with an oath, \xe2\x80\x98you shall see\r\nwhich is the best man of the two. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight him with sword or with\r\npistol, captain as he is. A man indeed! I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight any man--every man!\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I stand up to Mick Brady when I was eleven years old?--Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nbeat Tom Sullivan, the great hulking brute, who is nineteen?--Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\ndo for the Scotch usher? O Nora, it\xe2\x80\x99s cruel of you to sneer at me so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Nora was in the sneering mood that night, and pursued her sarcasms;\r\nshe pointed out that Captain Quin was already known as a valiant\r\nsoldier, famous as a man of fashion in London, and that it was mighty\r\nwell of Redmond to talk and boast of beating ushers and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 boys,\r\nbut to fight an Englishman was a very different matter.\r\n\r\nThen she fell to talk of the invasion, and of military matters\r\nin general; of King Frederick (who was called, in those days, the\r\nProtestant hero), of Monsieur Thurot and his fleet, of Monsieur Conflans\r\nand his squadron, of Minorca, how it was attacked, and where it was; we\r\nboth agreed it must be in America, and hoped the French might be soundly\r\nbeaten there.\r\n\r\nI sighed after a while (for I was beginning to melt), and said how much\r\nI longed to be a soldier; on which Nora recurred to her infallible \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\r\nnow, would you leave me, then? But, sure, you\xe2\x80\x99re not big enough for\r\nanything more than a little drummer.\xe2\x80\x99 To which I replied, by swearing\r\nthat a soldier I would be, and a general too.\r\n\r\nAs we were chattering in this silly way, we came to a place that has\r\never since gone by the name of Redmond\xe2\x80\x99s Leap Bridge. It was an old high\r\nbridge, over a stream sufficiently deep and rocky, and as the mare Daisy\r\nwith her double load was crossing this bridge, Miss Nora, giving a loose\r\nto her imagination, and still harping on the military theme (I would lay\r\na wager that she was thinking of Captain Quin)--Miss Nora said, \xe2\x80\x98Suppose\r\nnow, Redmond, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge, and\r\nthe inimy on the other side?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d draw my sword, and cut my way through them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?\xe2\x80\x99 (This young lady\r\nwas perpetually speaking of \xe2\x80\x98poor me!\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99d do. I\xe2\x80\x99d jump Daisy into the river,\r\nand swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jump twenty feet! you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to do any such thing on Daisy.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s horse, Black George, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard say that Captain\r\nQui--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe never finished the word, for, maddened by the continual recurrence\r\nof that odious monosyllable, I shouted to her to \xe2\x80\x98hold tight by my\r\nwaist,\xe2\x80\x99 and, giving Daisy the spur, in a minute sprang with Nora over\r\nthe parapet into the deep water below. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, now--whether\r\nit was I wanted to drown myself and Nora, or to perform an act that\r\neven Captain Quin should crane at, or whether I fancied that the enemy\r\nactually was in front of us, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell now; but over I went. The\r\nhorse sank over his head, the girl screamed as she sank and screamed as\r\nshe rose, and I landed her, half fainting, on the shore, where we were\r\nsoon found by my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s people, who returned on hearing the screams. I\r\nwent home, and was ill speedily of a fever, which kept me to my bed for\r\nsix weeks; and I quitted my couch prodigiously increased in stature,\r\nand, at the same time, still more violently in love than I had been even\r\nbefore. At the commencement of my illness, Miss Nora had been pretty\r\nconstant in her attendance at my bedside, forgetting, for the sake of\r\nme, the quarrel between my mother and her family; which my good mother\r\nwas likewise pleased, in the most Christian manner, to forget. And, let\r\nme tell you, it was no small mark of goodness in a woman of her haughty\r\ndisposition, who, as a rule, never forgave anybody, for my sake to give\r\nup her hostility to Miss Brady, and to receive her kindly. For, like a\r\nmad boy as I was, it was Nora I was always raving about and asking for;\r\nI would only accept medicines from her hand, and would look rudely and\r\nsulkily upon the good mother, who loved me better than anything else\r\nin the world, and gave up even her favourite habits, and proper and\r\nbecoming jealousies, to make me happy.\r\n\r\nAs I got well, I saw that Nora\xe2\x80\x99s visits became daily more rare: \xe2\x80\x98Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t she come?\xe2\x80\x99 I would say, peevishly, a dozen times in the day;\r\nin reply to which query, Mrs. Barry would be obliged to make the best\r\nexcuses she could find,--such as that Nora had sprained her ankle, or\r\nthat they had quarrelled together, or some other answer to soothe me.\r\nAnd many a time has the good soul left me to go and break her heart in\r\nher own room alone, and come back with a smiling face, so that I should\r\nknow nothing of her mortification. Nor, indeed, did I take much pains to\r\nascertain it: nor should I, I fear, have been very much touched even had\r\nI discovered it; for the commencement of manhood, I think, is the period\r\nof our extremest selfishness. We get such a desire then to take wing\r\nand leave the parent nest, that no tears, entreaties, or feelings\r\nof affection will counter-balance this overpowering longing after\r\nindependence. She must have been very sad, that poor mother of\r\nmine--Heaven be good to her!--at that period of my life; and has often\r\ntold me since what a pang of the heart it was to her to see all her care\r\nand affection of years forgotten by me in a minute, and for the sake of\r\na little heartless jilt, who was only playing with me while she could\r\nget no better suitor. For the fact is, that during the last four weeks\r\nof my illness, no other than Captain Quin was staying at Castle Brady,\r\nand making love to Miss Nora in form. My mother did not dare to break\r\nthis news to me, and you may be sure that Nora herself kept it a secret:\r\nit was only by chance that I discovered it.\r\n\r\nShall I tell you how? The minx had been to see me one day, as I sat up\r\nin my bed, convalescent; she was in such high spirits, and so gracious\r\nand kind to me, that my heart poured over with joy and gladness, and I\r\nhad even for my poor mother a kind word and a kiss that morning. I felt\r\nmyself so well that I ate up a whole chicken, and promised my uncle, who\r\nhad come to see me, to be ready against partridge-shooting, to accompany\r\nhim, as my custom was.\r\n\r\nThe next day but one was a Sunday, and I had a project for that day\r\nwhich I determined to realise, in spite of all the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s and my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions: which were that I was on no account to leave the\r\nhouse, for the fresh air would be the death of me.\r\n\r\nWell, I lay wondrous quiet, composing a copy of verses, the first I ever\r\nmade in my life; and I give them here, spelt as I spelt them in those\r\ndays when I knew no better. And though they are not so polished and\r\nelegant as \xe2\x80\x98Ardelia ease a Love-sick Swain,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98When Sol bedecks the\r\nDaisied Mead,\xe2\x80\x99 and other lyrical effusions of mine which obtained me\r\nso much reputation in after life, I still think them pretty good for a\r\nhumble lad of fifteen:--\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE OF FLORA.\r\n\r\nSent by a Young Gentleman of Quality to Miss Brady, of Castle Brady.\r\n\r\n On Brady\xe2\x80\x99s tower there grows a flower,\r\n   It is the loveliest flower that blows,--\r\n At Castle Brady there lives a lady\r\n  (And how I love her no one knows):\r\n Her name is Nora, and the goddess Flora\r\n  Presents her with this blooming rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Lady Nora,\xe2\x80\x99 says the goddess Flora,\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve many a rich and bright parterre;\r\n In Brady\xe2\x80\x99s towers there\xe2\x80\x99s seven more flowers,\r\n  But you\xe2\x80\x99re the fairest lady there:\r\n Not all the county, nor Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s bounty,\r\n  Can projuice a treasure that\xe2\x80\x99s half so fair!\r\n\r\n What cheek is redder? sure roses fed her!\r\n  Her hair is maregolds, and her eye of blew\r\n Beneath her eyelid is like the vi\xe2\x80\x99let,\r\n  That darkly glistens with gentle jew?\r\n The lily\xe2\x80\x99s nature is not surely whiter\r\n  Than Nora\xe2\x80\x99s neck is,--and her arrums too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, gentle Nora,\xe2\x80\x99 says the goddess Flora,\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98My dearest creature, take my advice,\r\n There is a poet, full well you know it,\r\n  Who spends his lifetime in heavy sighs,--\r\n Young Redmond Barry, \xe2\x80\x98tis him you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry,\r\n  If rhyme and raisin you\xe2\x80\x99d choose likewise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, no sooner was my mother gone to church, than I summoned Phil\r\nthe valet, and insisted upon his producing my best suit, in which I\r\narrayed myself (although I found that I had shot up so in my illness\r\nthat the old dress was wofully too small for me), and, with my notable\r\ncopy of verses in my hand, ran down towards Castle Brady, bent upon\r\nbeholding my beauty. The air was so fresh and bright, and the birds sang\r\nso loud amidst the green trees, that I felt more elated than I had been\r\nfor months before, and sprang down the avenue (my uncle had cut down\r\nevery stick of the trees, by the way) as brisk as a young fawn. My heart\r\nbegan to thump as I mounted the grass-grown steps of the terrace, and\r\npassed in by the rickety hall-door. The master and mistress were at\r\nchurch, Mr. Screw the butler told me (after giving a start back at\r\nseeing my altered appearance, and gaunt lean figure), and so were six of\r\nthe young ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was Miss Nora one?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Miss Nora was not one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Screw, assuming a very puzzled,\r\nand yet knowing look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where was she?\xe2\x80\x99 To this question he answered, or rather made believe\r\nto answer, with usual Irish ingenuity, and left me to settle whether she\r\nwas gone to Kilwangan on the pillion behind her brother, or whether she\r\nand her sister had gone for a walk, or whether she was ill in her room;\r\nand while I was settling this query, Mr. Screw left me abruptly.\r\n\r\nI rushed away to the back court, where the Castle Brady stables stand,\r\nand there I found a dragoon whistling the \xe2\x80\x98Roast Beef of Old England,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas he cleaned down a cavalry horse. \xe2\x80\x98Whose horse, fellow, is that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Feller, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the Englishman: \xe2\x80\x98the horse belongs to my\r\ncaptain, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a better FELLER nor you any day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did not stop to break his bones, as I would on another occasion, for\r\na horrible suspicion had come across me, and I made for the garden as\r\nquickly as I could.\r\n\r\nI knew somehow what I should see there. I saw Captain Quin and Nora\r\npacing the alley together. Her arm was under his, and the scoundrel was\r\nfondling and squeezing the hand which lay closely nestling against his\r\nodious waistcoat. Some distance beyond them was Captain Fagan of the\r\nKilwangan regiment, who was paying court to Nora\xe2\x80\x99s sister Mysie.\r\n\r\nI am not afraid of any man or ghost; but as I saw that sight my knees\r\nfell a-trembling violently under me, and such a sickness came over me,\r\nthat I was fain to sink down on the grass by a tree against which I\r\nleaned, and lost almost all consciousness for a minute or two: then\r\nI gathered myself up, and, advancing towards the couple on the walk,\r\nloosened the blade of the little silver-hilted hanger I always wore in\r\nits scabbard; for I was resolved to pass it through the bodies of the\r\ndelinquents, and spit them like two pigeons. I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell what feelings\r\nelse besides those of rage were passing through my mind; what bitter\r\nblank disappointment, what mad wild despair, what a sensation as if the\r\nwhole world was tumbling from under me; I make no doubt that my reader\r\nhath been jilted by the ladies many times, and so bid him recall his own\r\nsensations when the shock first fell upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Norelia,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain (for it was the fashion of those times\r\nfor lovers to call themselves by the most romantic names out of novels),\r\n\xe2\x80\x98except for you and four others, I vow before all the gods, my heart has\r\nnever felt the soft flame!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you men, you men, Eugenio!\xe2\x80\x99 said she (the beast\xe2\x80\x99s name was John),\r\n\xe2\x80\x98your passion is not equal to ours. We are like--like some plant I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nread of--we bear but one flower and then we die!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean you never felt an inclination for another?\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain\r\nQuin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never, my Eugenio, but for thee! How can you ask a blushing nymph such\r\na question?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Darling Norelia!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, raising her hand to his lips.\r\n\r\nI had a knot of cherry-coloured ribands, which she had given me out of\r\nher breast, and which somehow I always wore upon me. I pulled these out\r\nof my bosom, and flung them in Captain Quin\xe2\x80\x99s face, and rushed out with\r\nmy little sword drawn, shrieking, \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a liar--she\xe2\x80\x99s a liar, Captain\r\nQuin! Draw, sir, and defend yourself, if you are a man!\xe2\x80\x99 and with these\r\nwords I leapt at the monster, and collared him, while Nora made the air\r\necho with her screams; at the sound of which the other captain and Mysie\r\nhastened up.\r\n\r\nAlthough I sprang up like a weed in my illness, and was now nearly\r\nattained to my full growth of six feet, yet I was but a lath by the side\r\nof the enormous English captain, who had calves and shoulders such as no\r\nchairman at Bath ever boasted. He turned very red, and then exceedingly\r\npale at my attack upon him, and slipped back and clutched at his\r\nsword--when Nora, in an agony of terror, flung herself round him,\r\nscreaming, \xe2\x80\x98Eugenio! Captain Quin, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake spare the child--he\r\nis but an infant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And ought to be whipped for his impudence,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nnever fear, Miss Brady, I shall not touch him; your FAVOURITE is safe\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x99 So saying, he stooped down and picked up the bunch of ribands\r\nwhich had fallen at Nora\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and handing it to her, said in a\r\nsarcastic tone, \xe2\x80\x98When ladies make presents to gentlemen, it is time for\r\nOTHER gentlemen to retire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good heavens, Quin!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the girl; \xe2\x80\x98he is but a boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am a man,\xe2\x80\x99 roared I, \xe2\x80\x98and will prove it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And don\xe2\x80\x99t signify any more than my parrot or lap-dog. Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I give a\r\nbit of riband to my own cousin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are perfectly welcome, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the Captain, \xe2\x80\x98as many yards\r\nas you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Monster!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the dear girl; \xe2\x80\x98your father was a tailor, and\r\nyou are always thinking of the shop. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my revenge, I will!\r\nReddy, will you see me insulted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, Miss Nora,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98I intend to have his blood as sure as my\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s Redmond.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for the usher to cane you, little boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain,\r\nregaining his self-possession; \xe2\x80\x98but as for you, miss, I have the honour\r\nto wish you a good-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat with much ceremony, made a low CONGE, and was just\r\nwalking off, when Mick, my cousin, came up, whose ear had likewise been\r\ncaught by the scream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hoity-toity! Jack Quin, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter here?\xe2\x80\x99 says Mick; \xe2\x80\x98Nora in\r\ntears, Redmond\xe2\x80\x99s ghost here with his sword drawn, and you making a bow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, Mr. Brady,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Englishman: \xe2\x80\x98I have had\r\nenough of Miss Nora, here, and your Irish ways. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t used to \xe2\x80\x98em,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well! what is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mick good-humouredly (for he owed Quin a\r\ngreat deal of money as it turned out); \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll make you used to our ways,\r\nor adopt English ones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not the English way for ladies to have two lovers\xe2\x80\x99 (the \xe2\x80\x98Henglish\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x99 as the captain called it), \xe2\x80\x98and so, Mr. Brady, I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you\r\nto pay me the sum you owe me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll resign all claims to this young\r\nlady. If she has a fancy for schoolboys, let her take \xe2\x80\x98em, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh! Quin, you are joking,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never was more in earnest,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Heaven, then, look to yourself!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mick. \xe2\x80\x98Infamous seducer!\r\ninfernal deceiver!--you come and wind your toils round this suffering\r\nangel here--you win her heart and leave her--and fancy her brother won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndefend her? Draw this minute, you slave! and let me cut the wicked heart\r\nout of your body!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is regular assassination,\xe2\x80\x99 said Quin, starting back; \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s two\r\non \xe2\x80\x98em on me at once. Fagan, you won\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x98em murder me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Faith!\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain Fagan, who seemed mightily amused, \xe2\x80\x98you may settle\r\nyour own quarrel, Captain Quin;\xe2\x80\x99 and coming over to me, whispered, \xe2\x80\x98At\r\nhim again, you little fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As long as Mr. Quin withdraws his claim,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I, of course, do not\r\ninterfere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, sir--I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Quin, more and more flustered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then defend yourself like a man, curse you!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mick again. \xe2\x80\x98Mysie,\r\nlead this poor victim away--Redmond and Fagan will see fair play between\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well now--I don\xe2\x80\x99t--give me time--I\xe2\x80\x99m puzzled--I--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which way\r\nto look.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Like the donkey betwixt the two bundles of hay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Fagan drily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and there\xe2\x80\x99s pretty pickings on either side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. I SHOW MYSELF TO BE A MAN OF SPIRIT\r\n\r\nDuring this dispute, my cousin Nora did the only thing that a lady,\r\nunder such circumstances, could do, and fainted in due form. I was in\r\nhot altercation with Mick at the time, or I should have, of course,\r\nflown to her assistance, but Captain Fagan (a dry sort of fellow this\r\nFagan was) prevented me, saying, \xe2\x80\x98I advise you to leave the young\r\nlady to herself, Master Redmond, and be sure she will come to.\xe2\x80\x99 And so\r\nindeed, after a while, she did, which has shown me since that Fagan\r\nknew the world pretty well, for many\xe2\x80\x99s the lady I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in after times\r\nrecover in a similar manner. Quin did not offer to help her, you may be\r\nsure, for, in the midst of the diversion, caused by her screaming, the\r\nfaithless bully stole away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which of us is Captain Quin to engage?\xe2\x80\x99 said I to Mick; for it was my\r\nfirst affair, and I was as proud of it as of a suit of laced velvet. \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nit you or I, Cousin Mick, that is to have the honour of chastising this\r\ninsolent Englishman?\xe2\x80\x99 And I held out my hand as I spoke, for my heart\r\nmelted towards my cousin under the triumph of the moment.\r\n\r\nBut he rejected the proffered offer of friendship. \xe2\x80\x98You--you!\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\nin a towering passion; \xe2\x80\x98hang you for a meddling brat: your hand is in\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s pie. What business had you to come brawling and quarrelling\r\nhere, with a gentleman who has fifteen hundred a year?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Nora, from the stone bench, \xe2\x80\x98I shall die: I know I shall. I\r\nshall never leave this spot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s not gone yet,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Fagan; on which Nora, giving him\r\nan indignant look, jumped up and walked towards the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meanwhile,\xe2\x80\x99 Mick continued, \xe2\x80\x98what business have you, you meddling\r\nrascal, to interfere with a daughter of this house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rascal yourself!\xe2\x80\x99 roared I: \xe2\x80\x98call me another such name, Mick Brady, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll drive my hanger into your weasand. Recollect, I stood to you when I\r\nwas eleven years old. I\xe2\x80\x99m your match now, and, by Jove, provoke me, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll beat you like--like your younger brother always did.\xe2\x80\x99 That was a\r\nhome-cut, and I saw Mick turn blue with fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fagan,\r\nin a soothing tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The girl\xe2\x80\x99s old enough to be his mother,\xe2\x80\x99 growled Mick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old or not,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied: \xe2\x80\x98you listen to this, Mick Brady\xe2\x80\x99 (and I swore a\r\ntremendous oath, that need not be put down here): \xe2\x80\x98the man that marries\r\nNora Brady must first kill me--do you mind that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mick, turning away, \xe2\x80\x98kill you--flog you, you mean!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll send for Nick the huntsman to do it;\xe2\x80\x99 and so he went off.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fagan now came up, and taking me kindly by the hand, said I was\r\na gallant lad, and he liked my spirit. \xe2\x80\x98But what Brady says is true,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued he; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard thing to give a lad counsel who is in such\r\na far-gone state as you; but, believe me, I know the world, and if you\r\nwill but follow my advice, you won\xe2\x80\x99t regret having taken it. Nora Brady\r\nhas not a penny; you are not a whit richer. You are but fifteen, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s four-and-twenty. In ten years, when you\xe2\x80\x99re old enough to marry,\r\nshe will be an old woman; and, my poor boy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see--though it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhard matter to see--that she\xe2\x80\x99s a flirt, and does not care a pin for you\r\nor Quin either?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut who in love (or in any other point, for the matter of that) listens\r\nto advice? I never did, and I told Captain Fagan fairly, that Nora might\r\nlove me or not as she liked, but that Quin should fight me before he\r\nmarried her--that I swore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Faith,\xe2\x80\x99 says Fagan, \xe2\x80\x98I think you are a lad that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to keep your\r\nword;\xe2\x80\x99 and, looking hard at me for a second or two, he walked away\r\nlikewise, humming a tune: and I saw he looked back at me as he went\r\nthrough the old gate out of the garden. When he was gone, and I was\r\nquite alone, I flung myself down on the bench where Nora had made\r\nbelieve to faint, and had left her handkerchief; and, taking it up, hid\r\nmy face in it, and burst into such a passion of tears as I would then\r\nhave had nobody see for the world. The crumpled riband which I had flung\r\nat Quin lay in the walk, and I sat there for hours, as wretched as any\r\nman in Ireland, I believe, for the time being. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a changeable\r\nworld! When we consider how great our sorrows SEEM, and how small they\r\nARE; how we think we shall die of grief, and how quickly we forget, I\r\nthink we ought to be ashamed of ourselves and our fickle-heartedness.\r\nFor, after all, what business has time to bring us consolation? I\r\nhave not, perhaps, in the course of my multifarious adventures and\r\nexperience, hit upon the right woman; and have forgotten, after a\r\nlittle, every single creature I adored; but I think, if I could but have\r\nlighted on the right one, I would have loved her for EVER.\r\n\r\nI must have sat for some hours bemoaning myself on the garden bench, for\r\nit was morning when I came to Castle Brady, and the dinner-bell\r\nclanged as usual at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, which wakened me up from my reverie.\r\nPresently I gathered up the handkerchief, and once more took the riband.\r\nAs I passed through the offices, I saw the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s saddle was still\r\nhanging up at the stable-door, and saw his odious red-coated brute of\r\na servant swaggering with the scullion-girls and kitchen-people. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nEnglishman\xe2\x80\x99s still there, Master Redmond,\xe2\x80\x99 said one of the maids to me\r\n(a sentimental black-eyed girl, who waited on the young ladies). \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthere in the parlour, with the sweetest fillet of vale; go in, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet him browbeat you, Master Redmond.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd in I went, and took my place at the bottom of the big table, as\r\nusual, and my friend the butler speedily brought me a cover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hallo, Reddy my boy!\xe2\x80\x99 said my uncle, \xe2\x80\x98up and well?--that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99d better be home with his mother,\xe2\x80\x99 growled my aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind her,\xe2\x80\x99 says Uncle Brady; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the cold goose she ate at\r\nbreakfast didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with her. Take a glass of spirits, Mrs. Brady, to\r\nRedmond\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x99 It was evident he did not know of what had happened;\r\nbut Mick, who was at dinner too, and Ulick, and almost all the girls,\r\nlooked exceedingly black, and the Captain foolish; and Miss Nora, who\r\nwas again by his side, ready to cry. Captain Fagan sat smiling; and I\r\nlooked on as cold as a stone. I thought the dinner would choke me: but\r\nI was determined to put a good face on it, and when the cloth was drawn,\r\nfilled my glass with the rest; and we drank the King and the Church,\r\nas gentlemen should. My uncle was in high good-humour, and especially\r\nalways joking with Nora and the Captain. It was, \xe2\x80\x98Nora, divide that\r\nmerry-thought with the Captain! see who\xe2\x80\x99ll be married first.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Jack\r\nQuin, my dear boy, never mind a clean glass for the claret, we\xe2\x80\x99re short\r\nof crystal at Castle Brady; take Nora\xe2\x80\x99s and the wine will taste none the\r\nworse;\xe2\x80\x99 and so on. He was in the highest glee,--I did not know why. Had\r\nthere been a reconciliation between the faithless girl and her lover\r\nsince they had come into the house?\r\n\r\nI learned the truth very soon. At the third toast, it was always the\r\ncustom for the ladies to withdraw; but my uncle stopped them this time,\r\nin spite of the remonstrances of Nora, who said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, pa! do let us go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98No, Mrs. Brady and ladies, if you plaise; this is a sort of\r\ntoast that is drunk a great dale too seldom in my family, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nplaise to receive it with all the honours. Here\xe2\x80\x99s CAPTAIN AND MRS.\r\nJOHN QUIN, and long life to them. Kiss her, Jack, you rogue: for \xe2\x80\x98faith\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a treasure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has already \xe2\x80\x98----I screeched out, springing up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, you fool--hold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x99 said big Ulick, who sat\r\nby me; but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has already,\xe2\x80\x99 I screamed, \xe2\x80\x98been slapped in the face this morning,\r\nCaptain John Quin; he\xe2\x80\x99s already been called coward, Captain John Quin;\r\nand this is the way I\xe2\x80\x99ll drink his health. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your health, Captain\r\nJohn Quin!\xe2\x80\x99 And I flung a glass of claret into his face. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow he looked after it, for the next moment I myself was under the\r\ntable, tripped up by Ulick, who hit me a violent cuff on the head as I\r\nwent down; and I had hardly leisure to hear the general screaming and\r\nskurrying that was taking place above me, being so fully occupied with\r\nkicks, and thumps, and curses, with which Ulick was belabouring me. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nfool!\xe2\x80\x99 roared he--\xe2\x80\x99 you great blundering marplot--you silly beggarly\r\nbrat\xe2\x80\x99 (a thump at each), \xe2\x80\x98hold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x99 These blows from Ulick, of\r\ncourse, I did not care for, for he had always been my friend, and had\r\nbeen in the habit of thrashing me all my life.\r\n\r\nWhen I got up from under the table all the ladies were gone; and I had\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s nose was bleeding, as mine\r\nwas--HIS was cut across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled for ever.\r\nUlick shook himself, sat down quietly, filled a bumper, and pushed the\r\nbottle to me. \xe2\x80\x98There, you young donkey,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98sup that; and let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhear no more of your braying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, what does all the row mean?\xe2\x80\x99 says my uncle. \xe2\x80\x98Is the\r\nboy in the fever again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all your fault,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mick sulkily: \xe2\x80\x98yours and those who brought\r\nhim here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your noise, Mick!\xe2\x80\x99 says Ulick, turning on him; \xe2\x80\x98speak civil of my\r\nfather and me, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let me be called upon to teach you manners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It IS your fault,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mick. \xe2\x80\x98What business has the vagabond here?\r\nIf I had my will, I\xe2\x80\x99d have him flogged and turned out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so he should be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain Quin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d best not try it, Quin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick, who was always my champion;\r\nand turning to his father, \xe2\x80\x98The fact is, sir, that the young monkey has\r\nfallen in love with Nora, and finding her and the Captain mighty sweet\r\nin the garden to-day, he was for murdering Jack Quin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gad, he\xe2\x80\x99s beginning young,\xe2\x80\x99 said my uncle, quite good-humouredly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith, Fagan, that boy\xe2\x80\x99s a Brady, every inch of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Mr. B.,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Quin, bristling up: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ninsulted grossly in this \xe2\x80\x98OUSE. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t at all satisfied with these here\r\nways of going on. I\xe2\x80\x99m an Englishman I am, and a man of property; and\r\nI--I\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99re insulted, and not satisfied, remember there\xe2\x80\x99s two of\r\nus, Quin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick gruffly. On which the Captain fell to washing his\r\nnose in water, and answered never a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Quin,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, in the most dignified tone I could assume, \xe2\x80\x98may\r\nalso have satisfaction any time he pleases, by calling on Redmond Barry,\r\nEsquire, of Barryville.\xe2\x80\x99 At which speech my uncle burst out a-laughing\r\n(as he did at everything); and in this laugh, Captain Fagan, much to my\r\nmortification, joined. I turned rather smartly upon him, however, and\r\nbade him to understand that as for my cousin Ulick, who had been my best\r\nfriend through life, I could put up with rough treatment from him; yet,\r\nthough I was a boy, even that sort of treatment I would bear from him\r\nno longer; and any other person who ventured on the like would find me a\r\nman, to their cost. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Quin,\xe2\x80\x99 I added, \xe2\x80\x98knows that fact very well; and\r\nif HE\xe2\x80\x99S a man, he\xe2\x80\x99ll know where to find me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy uncle now observed that it was getting late, and that my mother would\r\nbe anxious about me. \xe2\x80\x98One of you had better go home with him,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\nturning to his sons, \xe2\x80\x98or the lad may be playing more pranks.\xe2\x80\x99 But Ulick\r\nsaid, with a nod to his brother, \xe2\x80\x98Both of us ride home with Quin here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of Freny\xe2\x80\x99s people,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain, with a faint\r\nattempt at a laugh; \xe2\x80\x98my man is armed, and so am I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know the use of arms very well, Quin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick; \xe2\x80\x98and no one can\r\ndoubt your courage; but Mick and I will see you home for all that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ll not be home till morning, boys. Kilwangan\xe2\x80\x99s a good ten mile\r\nfrom here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep at Quin\xe2\x80\x99s quarters,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Ulick: \xe2\x80\x98WE\xe2\x80\x99RE GOING TO STOP A\r\nWEEK THERE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 says Quin, very faint; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll be lonely, you know, without us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, very lonely!\xe2\x80\x99 says Quin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And in ANOTHER WEEK, my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 says Ulick (and here he whispered\r\nsomething in the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s ear, in which I thought I caught the words\r\n\xe2\x80\x98marriage,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98parson,\xe2\x80\x99 and felt all my fury returning again).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you please,\xe2\x80\x99 whined out the Captain; and the horses were quickly\r\nbrought round, and the three gentlemen rode away.\r\n\r\nFagan stopped, and, at my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s injunction, walked across the old\r\ntreeless park with me. He said that after the quarrel at dinner, he\r\nthought I would scarcely want to see the ladies that night, in which\r\nopinion I concurred entirely; and so we went off without an adieu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A pretty day\xe2\x80\x99s work of it you have made, Master Redmond,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe. \xe2\x80\x98What! you a friend to the Bradys, and knowing your uncle to be\r\ndistressed for money, try and break off a match which will bring fifteen\r\nhundred a year into the family? Quin has promised to pay off the four\r\nthousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl\r\nwithout a penny--a girl with no more beauty than yonder bullock.\r\nWell, well, don\xe2\x80\x99t look furious; let\xe2\x80\x99s say she IS handsome--there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\naccounting for tastes,--a girl that has been flinging herself at the\r\nhead of every man in these parts these ten years past, and MISSING them\r\nall. And you, as poor as herself, a boy of fifteen--well, sixteen, if\r\nyou insist--and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this is the return you make him for his kindness! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he harbour\r\nyou in his house when you were an orphan, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he given you\r\nrent-free your fine mansion of Barryville yonder? And now, when his\r\naffairs can be put into order, and a chance offers for his old age to\r\nbe made comfortable, who flings himself in the way of him and\r\ncompetence?--You, of all others; the man in the world most obliged to\r\nhim. It\xe2\x80\x99s wicked, ungrateful, unnatural. From a lad of such spirit as\r\nyou are, I expect a truer courage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not afraid of any man alive,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed I (for this latter part of\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s argument had rather staggered me, and I wished, of course,\r\nto turn it--as one always should when the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s too strong); \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_I_ am the injured man, Captain Fagan. No man was ever, since the world\r\nbegan, treated so. Look here--look at this riband. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worn it in\r\nmy heart for six months. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it there all the time of the fever.\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t Nora take it out of her own bosom and give it me? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she kiss\r\nme when she gave it me, and call me her darling Redmond?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was PRACTISING,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Fagan, with a sneer. \xe2\x80\x98I know women,\r\nsir. Give them time, and let nobody else come to the house, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfall in love with a chimney-sweep. There was a young lady in Fermoy\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A young lady in flames,\xe2\x80\x99 roared I (but I used a still hotter word).\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mark this; come what will of it, I swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight the man who\r\npretends to the hand of Nora Brady. I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow him, if it\xe2\x80\x99s into the\r\nchurch, and meet him there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have his blood, or he shall have mine;\r\nand this riband shall be found dyed in it. Yes, and if I kill him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npin it on his breast, and then she may go and take back her token.\xe2\x80\x99 This\r\nI said because I was very much excited at the time, and because I had\r\nnot read novels and romantic plays for nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says Fagan after a pause, \xe2\x80\x98if it must be, it must. For a young\r\nfellow, you are the most blood-thirsty I ever saw. Quin\xe2\x80\x99s a determined\r\nfellow, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you take my message to him?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, quite eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fagan: \xe2\x80\x98your mother may be on the look-out. Here we are,\r\nclose to Barryville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mind! not a word to my mother,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; and went into the house\r\nswelling with pride and exultation to think that I should have a chance\r\nagainst the Englishman I hated so.\r\n\r\nTim, my servant, had come up from Barryville on my mother\xe2\x80\x99s return from\r\nchurch; for the good lady was rather alarmed at my absence, and anxious\r\nfor my return. But he had seen me go in to dinner, at the invitation of\r\nthe sentimental lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid; and when he had had his own share of the\r\ngood things in the kitchen, which was always better furnished than ours\r\nat home, had walked back again to inform his mistress where I was, and,\r\nno doubt, to tell her, in his own fashion, of all the events that had\r\nhappened at Castle Brady. In spite of my precautions to secrecy, then,\r\nI half suspected that my mother knew all, from the manner in which she\r\nembraced me on my arrival, and received our guest, Captain Fagan. The\r\npoor soul looked a little anxious and flushed, and every now and then\r\ngazed very hard in the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s face; but she said not a word about the\r\nquarrel, for she had a noble spirit, and would as lief have seen anyone\r\nof her kindred hanged as shirking from the field of honour. What has\r\nbecome of those gallant feelings nowadays? Sixty years ago a man was a\r\nMAN, in old Ireland, and the sword that was worn by his side was at the\r\nservice of any gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s gizzard, upon the slightest difference. But\r\nthe good old times and usages are fast fading away. One scarcely every\r\nhears of a fair meeting now, and the use of those cowardly pistols, in\r\nplace of the honourable and manly weapon of gentlemen, has introduced\r\na deal of knavery into the practice of duelling, that cannot be\r\nsufficiently deplored.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at home I felt that I was a man in earnest, and welcoming\r\nCaptain Fagan to Barryville, and introducing him to my mother, in a\r\nmajestic and dignified way, said the Captain must be thirsty after his\r\nwalk, and called upon Tim to bring up a bottle of the yellow-sealed\r\nBordeaux, and cakes and glasses, immediately.\r\n\r\nTim looked at the mistress in great wonderment: and the fact is, that\r\nsix hours previous I would as soon have thought of burning the house\r\ndown as calling for a bottle of claret on my own account; but I felt I\r\nwas a man now, and had a right to command; and my mother felt this too,\r\nfor she turned to the fellow and said, sharply, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear, you\r\nrascal, what YOUR MASTER says! Go, get the wine, and the cakes and\r\nglasses, directly.\xe2\x80\x99 Then (for you may be sure she did not give Tim the\r\nkeys of our little cellar) she went and got the liquor herself; and Tim\r\nbrought it in, on the silver tray, in due form. My dear mother poured\r\nout the wine, and drank the Captain welcome; but I observed her hand\r\nshook very much as she performed this courteous duty, and the bottle\r\nwent clink, clink, against the glass. When she had tasted her glass,\r\nshe said she had a headache, and would go to bed; and so I asked her\r\nblessing, as becomes a dutiful son--(the modern BLOODS have given up the\r\nrespectful ceremonies which distinguished a gentleman in my time)--and\r\nshe left me and Captain Fagan to talk over our important business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain,\xe2\x80\x99 I see now no other way out of the scrape\r\nthan a meeting. The fact is, there was a talk of it at Castle Brady,\r\nafter your attack upon Quin this afternoon, and he vowed that he would\r\ncut you in pieces: but the tears and supplications of Miss Honoria\r\ninduced him, though very unwillingly, to relent. Now, however, matters\r\nhave gone too far. No officer, bearing His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s commission, can\r\nreceive a glass of wine on his nose--this claret of yours is very good,\r\nby the way, and by your leave we\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for another bottle--without\r\nresenting the affront. Fight you must; and Quin is a huge strong\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll give the better mark,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98I am not afraid of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In faith,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain,\xe2\x80\x99 I believe you are not; for a lad, I never\r\nsaw more game in my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at that sword, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, pointing to an elegant silver-mounted\r\none, in a white shagreen case, that hung on the mantelpiece, under the\r\npicture of my father, Harry Barry. \xe2\x80\x98It was with that sword, sir, that my\r\nfather pinked Mohawk O\xe2\x80\x99Driscol, in Dublin, in the year 1740; with that\r\nsword, sir, he met Sir Huddlestone Fuddlestone, the Hampshire baronet,\r\nand ran him through the neck. They met on horseback, with sword and\r\npistol, on Hounslow Heath, as I dare say you have heard tell of, and\r\nthose are the pistols\xe2\x80\x99 (they hung on each side of the picture) \xe2\x80\x98which\r\nthe gallant Barry used. He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady\r\nFuddlestone, when in liquor, at the Brentford assembly. But, like a\r\ngentleman, he scorned to apologise, and Sir Huddlestone received a ball\r\nthrough his hat, before they engaged with the sword. I am Harry Barry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson, sir, and will act as becomes my name and my quality.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me a kiss, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fagan, with tears in his eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re after my own soul. As long as Jack Fagan lives you shall never\r\nwant a friend or a second.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! he was shot six months afterwards, carrying orders to my\r\nLord George Sackville, at Minden, and I lost thereby a kind friend. But\r\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is in store for us, and that night was a merry one\r\nat least. We had a second bottle, and a third too (I could hear the poor\r\nmother going downstairs for each, but she never came into the parlour\r\nwith them, and sent them in by the butler, Mr. Tim): and we parted\r\nat length, he engaging to arrange matters with Mr. Quin\xe2\x80\x99s second that\r\nnight, and to bring me news in the morning as to the place where the\r\nmeeting should take place. I have often thought since, how different my\r\nfate might have been, had I not fallen in love with Nora at that early\r\nage; and had I not flung the wine in Quin\xe2\x80\x99s face, and so brought on\r\nthe duel. I might have settled down in Ireland but for that (for Miss\r\nQuinlan was an heiress, within twenty miles of us, and Peter Burke,\r\nof Kilwangan, left his daughter Judy L700 a year, and I might have had\r\neither of them, had I waited a few years). But it was in my fate to be\r\na wanderer, and that battle with Quin sent me on my travels at a very\r\nearly age: as you shall hear anon.\r\n\r\nI never slept sounder in my life, though I woke a little earlier than\r\nusual; and you may be sure my first thought was of the event of the day,\r\nfor which I was fully prepared. I had ink and pen in my room--had I not\r\nbeen writing those verses to Nora but the day previous, like a poor fond\r\nfool as I was? And now I sat down and wrote a couple of letters more:\r\nthey might be the last, thought I, that I ever should write in my life.\r\nThe first was to my mother:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Honoured Madam\xe2\x80\x99--I wrote--\xe2\x80\x98This will not be given you unless I fall by\r\nthe hand of Captain Quin, whom I meet this day in the field of honour,\r\nwith sword and pistol. If I die, it is as a good Christian and a\r\ngentleman,--how should I be otherwise when educated by such a mother as\r\nyou? I forgive all my enemies--I beg your blessing as a dutiful son.\r\nI desire that my mare Nora, which my uncle gave me, and which I called\r\nafter the most faithless of her sex, may be returned to Castle Brady,\r\nand beg you will give my silver-hiked hanger to Phil Purcell, the\r\ngamekeeper. Present my duty to my uncle and Ulick, and all the girls of\r\nMY party there. And I remain your dutiful son,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98REDMOND BARRY.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo Nora I wrote:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This letter will be found in my bosom along with the token you gave me.\r\nIt will be dyed in my blood (unless I have Captain Quin\xe2\x80\x99s, whom I\r\nhate, but forgive), and will be a pretty ornament for you on your\r\nmarriage-day. Wear it, and think of the poor boy to whom you gave it,\r\nand who died (as he was always ready to do) for your sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98REDMOND.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese letters being written, and sealed with my father\xe2\x80\x99s great silver\r\nseal of the Barry arms, I went down to breakfast; where my mother was\r\nwaiting for me, you may be sure. We did not say a single word about what\r\nwas taking place: on the contrary, we talked of anything but that; about\r\nwho was at church the day before, and about my wanting new clothes now\r\nI was grown so tall. She said I must have a suit against winter,\r\nif--if--she could afford it. She winced rather at the \xe2\x80\x98if,\xe2\x80\x99 Heaven bless\r\nher! I knew what was in her mind. And then she fell to telling me about\r\nthe black pig that must be killed, and that she had found the speckled\r\nhen\xe2\x80\x99s nest that morning, whose eggs I liked so, and other such trifling\r\ntalk. Some of these eggs were for breakfast, and I ate them with a\r\ngood appetite; but in helping myself to salt I spilled it, on which she\r\nstarted up with a scream. \xe2\x80\x98THANK GOD,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98IT\xe2\x80\x99S FALLEN TOWARDS\r\nME.\xe2\x80\x99 And then, her heart being too full, she left the room. Ah! they\r\nhave their faults, those mothers; but are there any other women like\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone I went to take down the sword with which my father had\r\nvanquished the Hampshire baronet, and, would you believe it?--the brave\r\nwoman had tied A NEW RIBAND to the hilt: for indeed she had the courage\r\nof a lioness and a Brady united. And then I took down the pistols, which\r\nwere always kept bright and well oiled, and put some fresh flints I\r\nhad into the locks, and got balls and powder ready against the Captain\r\nshould come. There was claret and a cold fowl put ready for him on the\r\nsideboard, and a case-bottle of old brandy too, with a couple of little\r\nglasses on the silver tray with the Barry arms emblazoned. In after\r\nlife, and in the midst of my fortune and splendour, I paid thirty-five\r\nguineas, and almost as much more interest, to the London goldsmith who\r\nsupplied my father with that very tray. A scoundrel pawnbroker would\r\nonly give me sixteen for it afterwards; so little can we trust the\r\nhonour of rascally tradesmen!\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Captain Fagan arrived, on horseback, with a mounted\r\ndragoon after him. He paid his compliments to the collation which my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s care had provided for him, and then said, \xe2\x80\x98Look ye, Redmond my\r\nboy; this is a silly business. The girl will marry Quin, mark my words;\r\nand as sure as she does you\xe2\x80\x99ll forget her. You are but a boy. Quin is\r\nwilling to consider you as such. Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s a fine place, and if you have\r\na mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are\r\ntwenty guineas at your service. Make Quin an apology, and be off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A man of honour, Mr. Fagan,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98dies, but never apologises. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee the Captain hanged before I apologise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for it but a meeting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My mare is saddled and ready,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99s the meeting, and who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s second?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your cousins go out with him,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mr. Fagan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for my groom to bring my mare round,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98as soon as you\r\nhave rested yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 Tim was accordingly despatched for Nora, and I\r\nrode away, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take leave of Mrs. Barry. The curtains of\r\nher bedroom windows were down, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t move as we mounted and\r\ntrotted off... BUT TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS, you should have seen her as she\r\ncame tottering downstairs, and heard the scream which she gave as she\r\nhugged her boy to her heart, quite unharmed and without a wound in his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nWhat had taken place I may as well tell here. When we got to the ground,\r\nUlick, Mick, and the Captain were already there: Quin, flaming in red\r\nregimentals, as big a monster as ever led a grenadier company. The party\r\nwere laughing together at some joke of one or the other: and I must say\r\nI thought this laughter very unbecoming in my cousins, who were met,\r\nperhaps, to see the death of one of their kindred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope to spoil this sport,\xe2\x80\x99 says I to Captain Fagan, in a great rage,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and trust to see this sword of mine in yonder big bully\xe2\x80\x99s body.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! it\xe2\x80\x99s with pistols we fight,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Fagan. \xe2\x80\x98You are no match\r\nfor Quin with the sword.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll match any man with the sword,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But swords are to-day impossible; Captain Quin is--is lame. He knocked\r\nhis knee against the swinging park-gate last night, as he was riding\r\nhome, and can scarce move it now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not against Castle Brady gate,\xe2\x80\x99 says I: \xe2\x80\x98that has been off the hinges\r\nthese ten years.\xe2\x80\x99 On which Fagan said it must have been some other\r\ngate, and repeated what he had said to Mr. Quin and my cousins, when, on\r\nalighting from our horses, we joined and saluted those gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes! dead lame,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick, coming to shake me by the hand, while\r\nCaptain Quin took off his hat and turned extremely red. \xe2\x80\x98And very lucky\r\nfor you, Redmond my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Ulick; \xe2\x80\x98you were a dead man else;\r\nfor he is a devil of a fellow--isn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Fagan?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A regular Turk,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Fagan; adding, \xe2\x80\x98I never yet knew the man who\r\nstood to Captain Quin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hang the business!\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick; \xe2\x80\x98I hate it. I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of it. Say\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re sorry, Redmond: you can easily say that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If the young FELLER will go to DUBLING, as proposed\xe2\x80\x99--here interposed\r\nMr. Quin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am NOT sorry--I\xe2\x80\x99ll NOT apologise--and I\xe2\x80\x99ll as soon go to DUBLING as\r\nto--!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, with a stamp of my foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick with a laugh to Fagan. \xe2\x80\x98Take\r\nyour ground, Fagan,--twelve paces, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ten, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Quin, in a big voice; \xe2\x80\x98and make them short ones, do\r\nyou hear, Captain Fagan?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t bully, Mr. Quin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick surlily; \xe2\x80\x98here are the pistols.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nhe added, with some emotion, to me, \xe2\x80\x98God bless you, my boy; and when I\r\ncount three, fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Fagan put my pistol into my hand,--that is, not one of mine (which\r\nwere to serve, if need were, for the next round), but one of Ulick\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are all right,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Never fear: and, Redmond, fire at his\r\nneck--hit him there under the gorget. See how the fool shows himself\r\nopen.\xe2\x80\x99 Mick, who had never spoken a word, Ulick, and the Captain retired\r\nto one side, and Ulick gave the signal. It was slowly given, and I had\r\nleisure to cover my man well. I saw him changing colour and trembling as\r\nthe numbers were given. At \xe2\x80\x98three,\xe2\x80\x99 both our pistols went off. I heard\r\nsomething whizz by me, and my antagonist, giving a most horrible groan,\r\nstaggered backwards and fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s down--he\xe2\x80\x99s down!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the seconds, running towards him. Ulick\r\nlifted him up--Mick took his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s hit here, in the neck,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mick; and laying open his coat, blood\r\nwas seen gurgling from under his gorget, at the very spot at which I\r\naimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is it with you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick. \xe2\x80\x98Is he really hit?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, looking\r\nhard at him. The unfortunate man did not answer, but when the support\r\nof Ulick\xe2\x80\x99s arm was withdrawn from his back, groaned once more, and fell\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The young fellow has begun well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mick, with a scowl. \xe2\x80\x98You had\r\nbetter ride off, young sir, before the police are up. They had wind of\r\nthe business before we left Kilwangan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he quite dead?\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite dead,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the world\xe2\x80\x99s rid of A COWARD,\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain Fagan, giving the huge\r\nprostrate body a scornful kick with his foot. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all over with him,\r\nReddy,--he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98WE are not cowards, Fagan,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ulick roughly, \xe2\x80\x98whatever he was! Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nget the boy off as quick as we may. Your man shall go for a cart, and\r\ntake away the body of this unhappy gentleman. This has been a sad day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork for our family, Redmond Barry: you have robbed us of 1500(pounds) a\r\nyear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was Nora did it,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98not I.\xe2\x80\x99 And I took the riband she gave me\r\nout of my waistcoat, and the letter, and flung them down on the body of\r\nCaptain Quin. \xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 says I--\xe2\x80\x98take her those ribands. She\xe2\x80\x99ll know what\r\nthey mean: and that\xe2\x80\x99s all that\xe2\x80\x99s left to her of two lovers she had and\r\nruined.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did not feel any horror or fear, young as I was, in seeing my enemy\r\nprostrate before me; for I knew that I had met and conquered him\r\nhonourably in the field, as became a man of my name and blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, get the youngster out of the way,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMick.\r\n\r\nUlick said he would ride with me, and off accordingly we galloped, never\r\ndrawing bridle till we came to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s door. When there, Ulick told\r\nTim to feed my mare, as I would have far to ride that day; and I was in\r\nthe poor mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms in a minute.\r\n\r\nI need not tell how great were her pride and exultation when she heard\r\nfrom Ulick\xe2\x80\x99s lips the account of my behaviour at the duel. He urged,\r\nhowever, that I should go into hiding for a short time; and it was\r\nagreed between them that I should drop my name of Barry, and, taking\r\nthat of Redmond, go to Dublin, and there wait until matters were blown\r\nover. This arrangement was not come to without some discussion; for why\r\nshould I not be as safe at Barryville, she said, as my cousin and Ulick\r\nat Castle Brady?--bailiffs and duns never got near THEM; why should\r\nconstables be enabled to come upon me? But Ulick persisted in the\r\nnecessity of my instant departure; in which argument, as I was anxious\r\nto see the world, I must confess, I sided with him; and my mother was\r\nbrought to see that in our small house at Barryville, in the midst of\r\nthe village, and with the guard but of a couple of servants, escape\r\nwould be impossible. So the kind soul was forced to yield to my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentreaties, who promised her, however, that the affair would soon be\r\narranged, and that I should be restored to her. Ah! how little did he\r\nknow what fortune was in store for me!\r\n\r\nMy dear mother had some forebodings, I think, that our separation was\r\nto be a long one; for she told me that all night long she had been\r\nconsulting the cards regarding my fate in the duel: and that all the\r\nsigns betokened a separation; then, taking out a stocking from her\r\nescritoire, the kind soul put twenty guineas in a purse for me (she had\r\nherself but twenty-five), and made up a little valise, to be placed\r\nat the back of my mare, in which were my clothes, linen, and a silver\r\ndressing-case of my father\xe2\x80\x99s. She bade me, too, to keep the sword and\r\nthe pistols I had known to use so like a man. She hurried my departure\r\nnow (though her heart, I know, was full), and almost in half-an-hour\r\nafter my arrival at home I was once more on the road again, with the\r\nwide world as it were before me. I need not tell how Tim and the cook\r\ncried at my departure: and, mayhap, I had a tear or two myself in my\r\neyes; but no lad of sixteen is VERY sad who has liberty for the first\r\ntime, and twenty guineas in his pocket: and I rode away, thinking, I\r\nconfess, not so much of the kind mother left alone, and of the home\r\nbehind me, as of to-morrow, and all the wonders it would bring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. A FALSE START IN THE GENTEEL WORLD\r\n\r\nI rode that night as far as Carlow, where I lay at the best inn; and\r\nbeing asked what was my name by the landlord of the house, gave it as\r\nMr. Redmond, according to my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, and said I was of\r\nthe Redmonds of Waterford county, and was on my road to Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, to be educated there. Seeing my handsome appearance,\r\nsilver-hiked sword, and well-filled valise, my landlord made free to\r\nsend up a jug of claret without my asking; and charged, you may be sure,\r\npretty handsomely for it in the bill. No gentleman in those good old\r\ndays went to bed without a good share of liquor to set him sleeping, and\r\non this my first day\xe2\x80\x99s entrance into the world, I made a point to act\r\nthe fine gentleman completely; and, I assure you, succeeded in my part\r\nto admiration. The excitement of the events of the day, the quitting my\r\nhome, the meeting with Captain Quin, were enough to set my brains in a\r\nwhirl, without the claret; which served to finish me completely. I did\r\nnot dream of the death of Quin, as some milksops, perhaps, would have\r\ndone; indeed, I have never had any of that foolish remorse consequent\r\nupon any of my affairs of honour: always considering, from the first,\r\nthat where a gentleman risks his own life in manly combat, he is a fool\r\nto be ashamed because he wins. I slept at Carlow as sound as man could\r\nsleep; drank a tankard of small beer and a toast to my breakfast; and\r\nexchanged the first of my gold pieces to settle the bill, not forgetting\r\nto pay all the servants liberally, and as a gentleman should. I began\r\nso the first day of my life, and so have continued. No man has been\r\nat greater straits than I, and has borne more pinching poverty and\r\nhardship; but nobody can say of me that, if I had a guinea, I was not\r\nfree-handed with it, and did not spend it as well as a lord could do.\r\n\r\nI had no doubts of the future: thinking that a man of my person, parts,\r\nand courage, could make his way anywhere. Besides, I had twenty gold\r\nguineas in my pocket; a sum which (although I was mistaken) I calculated\r\nwould last me for four months at least, during which time something\r\nwould be done towards the making of my fortune. So I rode on, singing\r\nto myself, or chatting with the passers-by; and all the girls along the\r\nroad said God save me for a clever gentleman! As for Nora and Castle\r\nBrady, between to-day and yesterday there seemed to be a gap as of\r\nhalf-a-score of years. I vowed I would never re-enter the place but as a\r\ngreat man; and I kept my vow too, as you shall hear in due time.\r\n\r\nThere was much more liveliness and bustle on the king\xe2\x80\x99s highroad in\r\nthose times, than in these days of stage-coaches, which carry you from\r\none end of the kingdom to another in a few score hours. The gentry rode\r\ntheir own horses or drove in their own coaches, and spent three days\r\non a journey which now occupies ten hours; so that there was no lack\r\nof company for a person travelling towards Dublin. I made part of\r\nthe journey from Carlow towards Naas with a well-armed gentleman from\r\nKilkenny, dressed in green and a gold cord, with a patch on his eye, and\r\nriding a powerful mare. He asked me the question of the day, and whither\r\nI was bound, and whether my mother was not afraid on account of the\r\nhighwaymen to let one so young as myself to travel? But I said, pulling\r\nout one of them from a holster, that I had a pair of good pistols that\r\nhad already done execution, and were ready to do it again; and here, a\r\npock-marked man coming up, he put spurs into his bay mare and left me.\r\nShe was a much more powerful animal than mine; and, besides, I did not\r\nwish to fatigue my horse, wishing to enter Dublin that night, and in\r\nreputable condition.\r\n\r\nAs I rode towards Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of the peasant-people\r\nassembled round a one-horse chair, and my friend in green, as I thought,\r\nmaking off half a mile up the hill. A footman was howling \xe2\x80\x98Stop thief!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat the top of his voice; but the country fellows were only laughing at\r\nhis distress, and making all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had\r\njust befallen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure you might have kept him off with your blunderBUSH!\xe2\x80\x99 says one\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, the coward! to let the Captain BATE you; and he only one eye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncries another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The next time my Lady travels, she\xe2\x80\x99d better lave you at home!\xe2\x80\x99 said a\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is this noise, fellows?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, riding up amongst them, and,\r\nseeing a lady in the carriage very pale and frightened, gave a slash of\r\nmy whip, and bade the red-shanked ruffians keep off. \xe2\x80\x98What has happened,\r\nmadam, to annoy your Ladyship?\xe2\x80\x99 I said, pulling off my hat, and bringing\r\nmy mare up in a prance to the chair window.\r\n\r\nThe lady explained. She was the wife of Captain Fitzsimons, and was\r\nhastening to join the Captain at Dublin. Her chair had been stopped by a\r\nhighway-man: the great oaf of a servant-man had fallen down on his knees\r\narmed as he was; and though there were thirty people in the next field\r\nworking when the ruffian attacked her, not one of them would help her;\r\nbut, on the contrary, wished the Captain, as they called the highwayman,\r\ngood luck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure he\xe2\x80\x99s the friend of the poor,\xe2\x80\x99 said one fellow, \xe2\x80\x98and good luck to\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it any business of ours?\xe2\x80\x99 asked another. And another told,\r\ngrinning, that it was the famous Captain Freny, who, having bribed the\r\njury to acquit him two days back at Kilkenny assizes, had mounted his\r\nhorse at the gaol door, and the very next day had robbed two barristers\r\nwho were going the circuit.\r\n\r\nI told this pack of rascals to be off to their work, or they should\r\ntaste of my thong, and proceeded, as well as I could, to comfort Mrs.\r\nFitzsimons under her misfortunes. \xe2\x80\x98Had she lost much?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Everything: her\r\npurse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas; her jewels, snuff-boxes,\r\nwatches, and a pair of diamond shoe-buckles of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99 These\r\nmishaps I sincerely commiserated; and knowing her by her accent to be\r\nan Englishwoman, deplored the difference that existed between the\r\ntwo countries, and said that in OUR country (meaning England) such\r\natrocities were unknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, too, are an Englishman?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, with rather a tone of surprise.\r\nOn which I said I was proud to be such: as, in fact, I was; and I never\r\nknew a true Tory gentleman of Ireland who did not wish he could say as\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nI rode by Mrs. Fitzsimon\xe2\x80\x99s chair all the way to Naas; and, as she had\r\nbeen robbed of her purse, asked permission to lend her a couple of\r\npieces to pay her expenses at the inn: which sum she was graciously\r\npleased to accept, and was, at the same time, kind enough to invite\r\nme to share her dinner. To the lady\xe2\x80\x99s questions regarding my birth and\r\nparentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune (this\r\nwas not true; but what is the use of crying bad fish? my dear mother\r\ninstructed me early in this sort of prudence) and good family in the\r\ncounty of Waterford; that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that\r\nmy mother allowed me five hundred per annum. Mrs. Fitzsimons was equally\r\ncommunicative. She was the daughter of General Granby Somerset of\r\nWorcestershire, of whom, of course, I had heard (and though I had not,\r\nof course I was too well-bred to say so); and had made, as she must\r\nconfess, a runaway match with Ensign Fitzgerald Fitzsimons. Had I been\r\nin Donegal?--No! That was a pity. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s father possesses a\r\nhundred thousand acres there, and Fitzsimonsburgh Castle\xe2\x80\x99s the finest\r\nmansion in Ireland. Captain Fitzsimons is the eldest son; and, though he\r\nhas quarrelled with his father, must inherit the vast property. She went\r\non to tell me about the balls at Dublin, the banquets at the Castle, the\r\nhorse-races at the Phoenix, the ridottos and routs, until I became quite\r\neager to join in those pleasures; and I only felt grieved to think that\r\nmy position would render secrecy necessary, and prevent me from being\r\npresented at the Court, of which the Fitzsimonses were the most elegant\r\nornaments. How different was her lively rattle to that of the vulgar\r\nwenches at the Kilwangan assemblies! In every sentence she mentioned a\r\nlord or a person of quality. She evidently spoke French and Italian, of\r\nthe former of which languages I have said I knew a few words; and, as\r\nfor her English accent, why, perhaps I was no judge of that, for, to\r\nsay the truth, she was the first REAL English person I had ever met. She\r\nrecommended me, further, to be very cautious with regard to the company\r\nI should meet at Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries\r\nabounded; and my delight and gratitude to her may be imagined, when, as\r\nour conversation grew more intimate (as we sat over our dessert), she\r\nkindly offered to accommodate me with lodgings in her own house, where\r\nher Fitzsimons, she said, would welcome with delight her gallant young\r\npreserver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I have preserved nothing for you.\xe2\x80\x99 Which was\r\nperfectly true; for had I not come up too late after the robbery to\r\nprevent the highwayman from carrying off her money and pearls?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And sure, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, them wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sullivan, the blundering\r\nservant, who had been so frightened at Freny\xe2\x80\x99s approach, and was waiting\r\non us at dinner. \xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he return you the thirteenpence in copper, and\r\nthe watch, saying it was only pinch-beck?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut his lady rebuked him for a saucy varlet, and turned him out of the\r\nroom at once, saying to me when he had gone, \xe2\x80\x98that the fool didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the\r\npocket-book that Freny took from her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps had I been a little older in the world\xe2\x80\x99s experience, I should\r\nhave begun to see that Madam Fitzsimons was not the person of fashion\r\nshe pretended to be; but, as it was, I took all her stories for truth,\r\nand, when the landlord brought the bill for dinner, paid it with the air\r\nof a lord. Indeed, she made no motion to produce the two pieces I had\r\nlent to her; and so we rode on slowly towards Dublin, into which city we\r\nmade our entrance at nightfall. The rattle and splendour of the coaches,\r\nthe flare of the linkboys, the number and magnificence of the houses,\r\nstruck me with the greatest wonder; though I was careful to disguise\r\nthis feeling, according to my dear mother\xe2\x80\x99s directions, who told me that\r\nit was the mark of a man of fashion never to wonder at anything, and\r\nnever to admit that any house, equipage, or company he saw, was more\r\nsplendid or genteel than what he had been accustomed to at home.\r\n\r\nWe stopped, at length, at a house of rather mean appearance, and were\r\nlet into a passage by no means so clean as that at Barryville, where\r\nthere was a great smell of supper and punch. A stout red-faced man,\r\nwithout a periwig, and in rather a tattered nightgown and cap, made his\r\nappearance from the parlour, and embraced his lady (for it was Captain\r\nFitzsimons) with a great deal of cordiality. Indeed, when he saw that a\r\nstranger accompanied her, he embraced her more rapturously than ever.\r\nIn introducing me, she persisted in saying that I was her preserver, and\r\ncomplimented my gallantry as much as if I had killed Freny, instead\r\nof coming up when the robbery was over. The Captain said he knew the\r\nRedmonds of Waterford intimately well: which assertion alarmed me, as I\r\nknew nothing of the family to which I was stated to belong. But I posed\r\nhim, by asking WHICH of the Redmonds he knew, for I had never heard his\r\nname in our family. He said he knew the Redmonds of Redmondstown. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays I, \xe2\x80\x98mine are the Redmonds of Castle Redmond;\xe2\x80\x99 and so I put him off\r\nthe scent. I went to see my nag put up at a livery-stable hard by, with\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s horse and chair, and returned to my entertainer.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were the relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a\r\ncracked dish before him, the Captain said, \xe2\x80\x98My love, I wish I had known\r\nof your coming, for Bob Moriarty and I just finished the most delicious\r\nvenison pasty, which his Grace the Lord Lieutenant sent us, with a\r\nflask of Sillery from his own cellar. You know the wine, my dear? But as\r\nbygones are bygones, and no help for them, what say ye to a fine lobster\r\nand a bottle of as good claret as any in Ireland? Betty, clear these\r\nthings from the table, and make the mistress and our young friend\r\nwelcome to our home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot having small change, Mr. Fitzsimons asked me to lend him a\r\ntenpenny-piece to purchase the dish of lobsters; but his lady, handing\r\nout one of the guineas I had given her, bade the girl get the change\r\nfor that, and procure the supper; which she did presently, bringing back\r\nonly a very few shillings out of the guinea to her mistress, saying that\r\nthe fishmonger had kept the remainder for an old account. \xe2\x80\x98And the more\r\ngreat big blundering fool you, for giving the gold piece to him,\xe2\x80\x99 roared\r\nMr. Fitzsimons. I forget how many hundred guineas he said he had paid\r\nthe fellow during the year.\r\n\r\nOur supper was seasoned, if not by any great elegance, at least by a\r\nplentiful store of anecdotes, concerning the highest personages of the\r\ncity; with whom, according to himself, the Captain lived on terms of\r\nthe utmost intimacy. Not to be behindhand with him, I spoke of my own\r\nestates and property as if I was as rich as a duke. I told all the\r\nstories of the nobility I had ever heard from my mother, and some that,\r\nperhaps, I had invented; and ought to have been aware that my host\r\nwas an impostor himself, as he did not find out my own blunders and\r\nmisstatements. But youth is ever too confident. It was some time\r\nbefore I knew that I had made no very desirable acquaintance in Captain\r\nFitzsimons and his lady; and, indeed, went to bed congratulating myself\r\nupon my wonderful good luck in having, at the outset of my adventures,\r\nfallen in with so distinguished a couple.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the chamber I occupied might, indeed, have led me to\r\nimagine that the heir of Fitzsimonsburgh Castle, county Donegal, was not\r\nas yet reconciled with his wealthy parents; and, had I been an English\r\nlad, probably my suspicion and distrust would have been aroused\r\ninstantly. But perhaps, as the reader knows, we are not so particular in\r\nIreland on the score of neatness as people are in this precise country;\r\nhence the disorder of my bedchamber did not strike me so much. For were\r\nnot all the windows broken and stuffed with rags even at Castle Brady,\r\nmy uncle\xe2\x80\x99s superb mansion? Was there ever a lock to the doors there, or\r\nif a lock, a handle to the lock or a hasp to fasten it to? So, though\r\nmy bedroom boasted of these inconveniences, and a few more; though my\r\ncounterpane was evidently a greased brocade dress of Mrs. Fitzsimons\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand my cracked toilet-glass not much bigger than a half-crown, yet I was\r\nused to this sort of ways in Irish houses, and still thought myself in\r\nthat of a man of fashion. There was no lock to the drawers, which, when\r\nthey DID open, were full of my hostess\xe2\x80\x99s rouge-pots, shoes, stays, and\r\nrags; so I allowed my wardrobe to remain in my valise, but set out my\r\nsilver dressing-apparatus upon the ragged cloth on the drawers, where it\r\nshone to great advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen Sullivan appeared in the morning, I asked him about my mare,\r\nwhich he informed me was doing well. I then bade him bring me hot\r\nshaving-water, in a loud dignified tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hot shaving-water!\xe2\x80\x99 says he, bursting out laughing (and I confess not\r\nwithout reason). \xe2\x80\x98Is it yourself you\xe2\x80\x99re going to shave?\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nmaybe when I bring you up the water I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you up the cat too, and\r\nyou can shave her.\xe2\x80\x99 I flung a boot at the scoundrel\xe2\x80\x99s head in reply\r\nto this impertinence, and was soon with my friends in the parlour for\r\nbreakfast. There was a hearty welcome, and the same cloth that had\r\nbeen used the night before: as I recognised by the black mark of the\r\nIrish-stew dish, and the stain left by a pot of porter at supper.\r\n\r\nMy host greeted me with great cordiality; Mrs. Fitzsimons said I was an\r\nelegant figure for the Phoenix; and indeed, without vanity, I may say of\r\nmyself that there were worse-looking fellows in Dublin than I. I had not\r\nthe powerful chest and muscular proportion which I have since attained\r\n(to be exchanged, alas! for gouty legs and chalk-stones in my fingers;\r\nbut \xe2\x80\x98tis the way of mortality), but I had arrived at near my present\r\ngrowth of six feet, and with my hair in buckle, a handsome lace jabot\r\nand wristbands to my shirt, and a red plush waistcoat, barred with gold,\r\nlooked the gentleman I was born. I wore my drab coat with plate\r\nbuttons, that was grown too small for me, and quite agreed with Captain\r\nFitzsimons that I must pay a visit to his tailor, in order to procure\r\nmyself a coat more fitting my size.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I needn\xe2\x80\x99t ask whether you had a comfortable bed,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Young Fred\r\nPimpleton (Lord Pimpleton\xe2\x80\x99s second son) slept in it for seven months,\r\nduring which he did me the honour to stay with me, and if HE was\r\nsatisfied, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who else wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we walked out to see the town, and Mr. Fitzsimons\r\nintroduced me to several of his acquaintances whom we met, as his\r\nparticular young friend Mr. Redmond, of Waterford county; he also\r\npresented me at his hatter\xe2\x80\x99s and tailor\xe2\x80\x99s as a gentleman of great\r\nexpectations and large property; and although I told the latter that I\r\nshould not pay him ready cash for more than one coat, which fitted me to\r\na nicety, yet he insisted upon making me several, which I did not care\r\nto refuse. The Captain, also, who certainly wanted such a renewal of\r\nraiment, told the tailor to send him home a handsome military frock,\r\nwhich he selected.\r\n\r\nThen we went home to Mrs. Fitzsimons, who drove out in her chair to the\r\nPhoenix Park, where a review was, and where numbers of the young gentry\r\nwere round about her; to all of whom she presented me as her preserver\r\nof the day before. Indeed, such was her complimentary account of me,\r\nthat before half-an-hour I had got to be considered as a young gentleman\r\nof the highest family in the land, related to all the principal\r\nnobility, a cousin of Captain Fitzsimons, and heir to L10,000 a year.\r\nFitzsimons said he had ridden over every inch of my estate; and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98faith, as he chose to tell these stories for me, I let him have his\r\nway--indeed, was not a little pleased (as youth is) to be made much of,\r\nand to pass for a great personage. I had little notion then that I\r\nhad got among a set of impostors--that Captain Fitzsimons was only an\r\nadventurer, and his lady a person of no credit; but such are the dangers\r\nto which youth is perpetually subject, and hence let young men take\r\nwarning by me.\r\n\r\nI purposely hurry over the description of my life in which the incidents\r\nwere painful, of no great interest except to my unlucky self, and of\r\nwhich my companions were certainly not of a kind befitting my quality.\r\nThe fact was, a young man could hardly have fallen into worse hands than\r\nthose in which I now found myself. I have been to Donegal since,\r\nand have never seen the famous Castle of Fitzsimonsburgh, which is,\r\nlikewise, unknown to the oldest inhabitants of that county; nor are the\r\nGranby Somersets much better known in Worcestershire. The couple into\r\nwhose hands I had fallen were of a sort much more common then than at\r\npresent, for the vast wars of later days have rendered it very difficult\r\nfor noblemen\xe2\x80\x99s footmen or hangers-on to procure commissions; and such,\r\nin fact, had been the original station of Captain Fitzsimons. Had\r\nI known his origin, of course I would have died rather than have\r\nassociated with him: but in those simple days of youth I took his tales\r\nfor truth, and fancied myself in high luck at being, at my outset into\r\nlife, introduced into such a family. Alas! we are the sport of destiny.\r\nWhen I consider upon what small circumstances all the great events of my\r\nlife have turned, I can hardly believe myself to have been anything\r\nbut a puppet in the hands of Fate; which has played its most fantastic\r\ntricks upon me.\r\n\r\nThe Captain had been a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s gentleman, and his lady of no higher\r\nrank. The society which this worthy pair kept was at a sort of ordinary\r\nwhich they held, and at which their friends were always welcome on\r\npayment of a certain moderate sum for their dinner. After dinner, you\r\nmay be sure that cards were not wanting, and that the company who played\r\ndid not play for love merely. To these parties persons of all sorts\r\nwould come: young bloods from the regiments garrisoned in Dublin: young\r\nclerks from the Castle; horse-riding, wine-tippling, watchman-beating\r\nmen of fashion about town, such as existed in Dublin in that day more\r\nthan in any other city with which I am acquainted in Europe. I never\r\nknew young fellows make such a show, and upon such small means. I never\r\nknew young gentlemen with what I may call such a genius for idleness;\r\nand whereas an Englishman with fifty guineas a year is not able to do\r\nmuch more than starve, and toil like a slave in a profession, a young\r\nIrish buck with the same sum will keep his horses, and drink his bottle,\r\nand live as lazy as a lord. Here was a doctor who never had a patient,\r\ncheek by jowl with an attorney who never had a client: neither had\r\na guinea--each had a good horse to ride in the Park, and the best of\r\nclothes to his back. A sporting clergyman without a living; several\r\nyoung wine-merchants, who consumed much more liquor than they had or\r\nsold; and men of similar character, formed the society at the house\r\ninto which, by ill luck, I was thrown. What could happen to a man but\r\nmisfortune from associating with such company?--(I have not mentioned\r\nthe ladies of the society, who were, perhaps, no better than the\r\nmales)--and in a very very short time I became their prey.\r\n\r\nAs for my poor twenty guineas, in three days I saw, with terror, that\r\nthey had dwindled down to eight: theatres and taverns having already\r\nmade such cruel inroads in my purse. At play I had lost, it is true, a\r\ncouple of pieces; but seeing that every one round about me played upon\r\nhonour and gave their bills, I, of course, preferred that medium to the\r\npayment of ready money, and when I lost paid on account.\r\n\r\nWith the tailors, saddlers, and others, I employed similar means; and\r\nin so far Mr. Fitzsimons\xe2\x80\x99s representation did me good, for the tradesmen\r\ntook him at his word regarding my fortune (I have since learned that the\r\nrascal pigeoned several other young men of property), and for a little\r\ntime supplied me with any goods I might be pleased to order. At length,\r\nmy cash running low, I was compelled to pawn some of the suits with\r\nwhich the tailor had provided me; for I did not like to part with my\r\nmare, on which I daily rode in the Park, and which I loved as the\r\ngift of my respected uncle. I raised some little money, too, on a few\r\ntrinkets which I had purchased of a jeweller who pressed his credit upon\r\nme; and thus was enabled to keep up appearances for yet a little time.\r\n\r\nI asked at the post-office repeatedly for letters for Mr. Redmond, but\r\nnone such had arrived; and, indeed, I always felt rather relieved when\r\nthe answer of \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 was given to me; for I was not very anxious that my\r\nmother should know my proceedings in the extravagant life which I was\r\nleading at Dublin. It could not last very long, however; for when my\r\ncash was quite exhausted, and I paid a second visit to the tailor,\r\nrequesting him to make me more clothes, the fellow hummed and ha\xe2\x80\x99d, and\r\nhad the impudence to ask payment for those already supplied: on which,\r\ntelling him I should withdraw my custom from him, I abruptly left him.\r\nThe goldsmith too (a rascal Jew) declined to let me take a gold chain\r\nto which I had a fancy; and I felt now, for the first time, in some\r\nperplexity. To add to it, one of the young gentlemen who frequented Mr.\r\nFitzsimons\xe2\x80\x99s boarding-house had received from me, in the way of play,\r\nan IOU for eighteen pounds (which I lost to him at piquet), and which,\r\nowing Mr. Curbyn, the livery-stable keeper, a bill, he passed into that\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Fancy my rage and astonishment, then, on going for my\r\nmare, to find that he positively refused to let me have her out of the\r\nstable, except under payment of my promissory note! It was in vain that\r\nI offered him his choice of four notes that I had in my pocket--one of\r\nFitzsimons\xe2\x80\x99s for L20, one of Counsellor Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s, and so forth; the\r\ndealer, who was a Yorkshireman, shook his head, and laughed at every one\r\nof them; and said, \xe2\x80\x98I tell you what, Master Redmond, you appear a young\r\nfellow of birth and fortune, and let me whisper in your ear that you\r\nhave fallen into very bad hands--it\xe2\x80\x99s a regular gang of swindlers; and a\r\ngentleman of your rank and quality should never be seen in such company.\r\nGo home: pack up your valise, pay the little trifle to me, mount your\r\nmare, and ride back again to your parents,--it\xe2\x80\x99s the very best thing you\r\ncan do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a pretty nest of villains, indeed, was I plunged! It seemed as if\r\nall my misfortunes were to break on me at once; for, on going home and\r\nascending to my bedroom in a disconsolate way, I found the Captain\r\nand his lady there before me, my valise open, my wardrobe lying on the\r\nground, and my keys in the possession of the odious Fitzsimons. \xe2\x80\x98Whom\r\nhave I been harbouring in my house?\xe2\x80\x99 roared he, as I entered the\r\napartment. \xe2\x80\x98Who are you, sirrah?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98SIRRAH! Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re an impostor, young man: a schemer, a deceiver!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Repeat the words again, and I will run you through the body,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tut, tut! I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. REDMOND BARRY. Ah!\r\nyou change colour, do you--your secret is known, is it? You come like a\r\nviper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the\r\nheir of my friends the Redmonds of Castle Redmond; I inthrojuice you to\r\nthe nobility and genthry of this methropolis\xe2\x80\x99 (the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s brogue was\r\nlarge, and his words, by preference, long); \xe2\x80\x98I take you to my tradesmen,\r\nwho give you credit, and what do I find? That you have pawned the goods\r\nwhich you took up at their houses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have given them my acceptances, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I with a dignified air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98UNDER WHAT NAME, unhappy boy--under what name?\xe2\x80\x99 screamed Mrs.\r\nFitzsimons; and then, indeed, I remembered that I had signed the\r\ndocuments Barry Redmond instead of Redmond Barry: but what else could\r\nI do? Had not my mother desired me to take no other designation? After\r\nuttering a furious tirade against me, in which he spoke of the fatal\r\ndiscovery of my real name on my linen--of his misplaced confidence of\r\naffection, and the shame with which he should be obliged to meet his\r\nfashionable friends and confess that he had harboured a swindler, he\r\ngathered up the linen, clothes, silver toilet articles, and the rest of\r\nmy gear, saying that he should step out that moment for an officer and\r\ngive me up to the just revenge of the law.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of his speech, the thought of the imprudence of\r\nwhich I had been guilty, and the predicament in which I was plunged, had\r\nso puzzled and confounded me, that I had not uttered a word in reply to\r\nthe fellow\xe2\x80\x99s abuse, but had stood quite dumb before him. The sense of\r\ndanger, however, at once roused me to action. \xe2\x80\x98Hark ye, Mr. Fitzsimons,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I; \xe2\x80\x98I will tell you why I was obliged to alter my name: which is\r\nBarry, and the best name in Ireland. I changed it, sir, because, on\r\nthe day before I came to Dublin, I killed a man in deadly combat--an\r\nEnglishman, sir, and a captain in His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service; and if you\r\noffer to let or hinder me in the slightest way, the same arm which\r\ndestroyed him is ready to punish you; and by Heaven, sir, you or I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nleave this room alive!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo saying, I drew my sword like lightning, and giving a \xe2\x80\x98ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\na stamp with my foot, lunged within an inch of Fitzsimons\xe2\x80\x99s heart, who\r\nstarted back and turned deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream,\r\nflung herself between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Redmond,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, \xe2\x80\x98be pacified. Fitzsimons, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nthe poor child\xe2\x80\x99s blood. Let him escape--in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name let him go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He may go hang for me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fitzsimons sulkily; \xe2\x80\x98and he\xe2\x80\x99d better be\r\noff quickly, too, for the jeweller and the tailor have called once,\r\nand will be here again before long. It was Moses the pawnbroker that\r\npeached: I had the news from him myself.\xe2\x80\x99 By which I conclude that Mr.\r\nFitzsimons had been with the new laced frock-coat which he procured from\r\nthe merchant tailor on the day when the latter first gave me credit.\r\n\r\nWhat was the end of our conversation? Where was now a home for the\r\ndescendant of the Barrys? Home was shut to me by my misfortune in the\r\nduel. I was expelled from Dublin by a persecution occasioned, I must\r\nconfess, by my own imprudence. I had no time to wait and choose: no\r\nplace of refuge to fly to. Fitzsimons, after his abuse of me, left the\r\nroom growling, but not hostile; his wife insisted that we should shake\r\nhands, and he promised not to molest me. Indeed, I owed the fellow\r\nnothing; and, on the contrary, had his acceptance actually in my pocket\r\nfor money lost at play. As for my friend Mrs. Fitzsimons, she sat down\r\non the bed and fairly burst out crying. She had her faults, but her\r\nheart was kind; and though she possessed but three shillings in the\r\nworld, and fourpence in copper, the poor soul made me take it before\r\nI left her--to go--whither? My mind was made up: there was a score of\r\nrecruiting-parties in the town beating up for men to join our gallant\r\narmies in America and Germany; I knew where to find one of these, having\r\nstood by the sergeant at a review in the Phoenix Park, where he pointed\r\nout to me characters on the field, for which I treated him to drink.\r\n\r\nI gave one of my shillings to Sullivan the butler of the Fitzsimonses,\r\nand, running into the street, hastened to the little alehouse at which\r\nmy acquaintance was quartered, and before ten minutes had accepted His\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s shilling. I told him frankly that I was a young gentleman in\r\ndifficulties; that I had killed an officer in a duel, and was anxious\r\nto get out of the country. But I need not have troubled myself with any\r\nexplanations; King George was too much in want of men then to heed from\r\nwhence they came, and a fellow of my inches, the sergeant said, was\r\nalways welcome. Indeed, I could not, he said, have chosen my time\r\nbetter. A transport was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a wind, and on\r\nboard that ship, to which I marched that night, I made some surprising\r\ndiscoveries, which shall be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. IN WHICH BARRY TAKES A NEAR VIEW OF MILITARY GLORY\r\n\r\nI never had a taste for anything but genteel company, and hate all\r\ndescriptions of low life. Hence my account of the society in which I\r\nat present found myself must of necessity be short; and, indeed,\r\nthe recollection of it is profoundly disagreeable to me. Pah! the\r\nreminiscences of the horrid black-hole of a place in which we soldiers\r\nwere confined; of the wretched creatures with whom I was now forced to\r\nkeep company; of the ploughmen, poachers, pickpockets, who had taken\r\nrefuge from poverty, or the law (as, in truth, I had done myself), is\r\nenough to make me ashamed even now, and it calls the blush into my old\r\ncheeks to think I was ever forced to keep such company. I should have\r\nfallen into despair, but that, luckily, events occurred to rouse my\r\nspirits, and in some measure to console me for my misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe first of these consolations I had was a good quarrel, which took\r\nplace on the day after my entrance into the transport-ship, with a huge\r\nred-haired monster of a fellow--a chairman, who had enlisted to fly from\r\na vixen of a wife, who, boxer as he was, had been more than a match for\r\nhim. As soon as this fellow--Toole, I remember, was his name--got away\r\nfrom the arms of the washerwoman his lady, his natural courage and\r\nferocity returned, and he became the tyrant of all round about him.\r\nAll recruits, especially, were the object of the brute\xe2\x80\x99s insult and\r\nill-treatment.\r\n\r\nI had no money, as I said, and was sitting very disconsolately over a\r\nplatter of rancid bacon and mouldy biscuit, which was served to us at\r\nmess, when it came to my turn to be helped to drink, and I was served,\r\nlike the rest, with a dirty tin noggin, containing somewhat more than\r\nhalf a pint of rum-and-water. The beaker was so greasy and filthy that I\r\ncould not help turning round to the messman and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Fellow, get me\r\na glass!\xe2\x80\x99 At which all the wretches round about me burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter, the very loudest among them being, of course, Mr. Toole.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get the gentleman a towel for his hands, and serve him a basin of\r\nturtle-soup,\xe2\x80\x99 roared the monster, who was sitting, or rather squatting,\r\non the deck opposite me; and as he spoke he suddenly seized my beaker of\r\ngrog and emptied it, in the midst of another burst of applause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you want to vex him, ax him about his wife the washerwoman, who\r\nBATES him,\xe2\x80\x99 here whispered in my ear another worthy, a retired link-boy,\r\nwho, disgusted with his profession, had adopted the military life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it a towel of your wife\xe2\x80\x99s washing, Mr. Toole?\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m told she\r\nwiped your face often with one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ax him why he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see her yesterday, when she came to the ship,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued the link-boy. And so I put to him some other foolish jokes\r\nabout soapsuds, henpecking, and flat-irons, which set the man into a\r\nfury, and succeeded in raising a quarrel between us. We should have\r\nfallen to at once, but a couple of grinning marines, who kept watch at\r\nthe door, for fear we should repent of our bargain and have a fancy to\r\nescape, came forward and interposed between us with fixed bayonets;\r\nbut the sergeant coming down the ladder, and hearing the dispute,\r\ncondescended to say that we might fight it out like men with FISTES if\r\nwe chose, and that the fore-deck should be free to us for that purpose.\r\nBut the use of fistes, as the Englishman called them, was not then\r\ngeneral in Ireland, and it was agreed that we should have a pair\r\nof cudgels; with one of which weapons I finished the fellow in four\r\nminutes, giving him a thump across his stupid sconce which laid\r\nhim lifeless on the deck, and not receiving myself a single hurt of\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nThis victory over the cock of the vile dunghill obtained me respect\r\namong the wretches of whom I formed part, and served to set up my\r\nspirits, which otherwise were flagging; and my position was speedily\r\nmade more bearable by the arrival on board our ship of an old friend.\r\nThis was no other than my second in the fatal duel which had sent me\r\nthus early out into the world, Captain Fagan. There was a young nobleman\r\nwho had a company in our regiment (Gale\xe2\x80\x99s foot), and who, preferring the\r\ndelights of the Mall and the clubs to the dangers of a rough campaign,\r\nhad given Fagan the opportunity of an exchange; which, as the latter had\r\nno fortune but his sword, he was glad to make. The sergeant was\r\nputting us through our exercise on deck (the seamen and officers of the\r\ntransport looking grinning on) when a boat came from the shore bringing\r\nour captain to the ship; and though I started and blushed red as he\r\nrecognised me--a descendant of the Barrys--in this degrading posture, I\r\npromise you that the sight of Fagan\xe2\x80\x99s face was most welcome to me, for\r\nit assured me that a friend was near me. Before that I was so melancholy\r\nthat I would certainly have deserted had I found the means, and had not\r\nthe inevitable marines kept a watch to prevent any such escapes.\r\nFagan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of\r\nacquaintance; it was not until two days afterwards, and when we had\r\nbidden adieu to old Ireland and were standing out to sea, that he called\r\nme into his cabin, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me\r\nnews, which I much wanted, of my family. \xe2\x80\x98I had news of you in Dublin,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith you\xe2\x80\x99ve begun early, like your father\xe2\x80\x99s son; and I think\r\nyou could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write\r\nhome to your poor mother? She has sent a half-dozen letters to you at\r\nDublin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI said I had asked for letters at the post-office, but there were none\r\nfor Mr. Redmond. I did not like to add that I had been ashamed, after\r\nthe first week, to write to my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must write to her by the pilot,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98who will leave us in\r\ntwo hours; and you can tell her that you are safe, and married to Brown\r\nBess.\xe2\x80\x99 I sighed when he talked about being married; on which he said\r\nwith a laugh, \xe2\x80\x98I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Brady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nTown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Miss Brady well?\xe2\x80\x99 said I; and indeed, could hardly utter it, for I\r\ncertainly WAS thinking about her: for, though I had forgotten her in\r\nthe gaieties of Dublin, I have always found adversity makes man very\r\naffectionate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s only seven Miss Bradys now,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Fagan, in a solemn voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Nora\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good heavens! what of her?\xe2\x80\x99 I thought grief had killed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console\r\nherself with a husband. She\xe2\x80\x99s now Mrs. John Quin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. John Quin! Was there ANOTHER Mr. John Quin?\xe2\x80\x99 asked I, quite\r\nwonder-stricken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; the very same one, my boy. He recovered from his wound. The ball\r\nyou hit him with was not likely to hurt him. It was only made of tow.\r\nDo you think the Bradys would let you kill fifteen hundred a year out of\r\nthe family?\xe2\x80\x99 And then Fagan further told me that, in order to get me out\r\nof the way--for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry\r\nfrom fear of me--the plan of the duel had been arranged. \xe2\x80\x98But hit him\r\nyou certainly did, Redmond, and with a fine thick plugget of tow; and\r\nthe fellow was so frightened, that he was an hour in coming to. We\r\ntold your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made; she\r\ndespatched a half-score of letters to Dublin after you, but I suppose\r\naddressed them to you in your real name, by which you never thought to\r\nask for them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The coward!\xe2\x80\x99 said I (though, I confess, my mind was considerably\r\nrelieved at the thoughts of not having killed him). \xe2\x80\x98And did the Bradys\r\nof Castle Brady consent to admit a poltroon like that into one of the\r\nmost ancient and honourable families in the world?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has paid off your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fagan; \xe2\x80\x98he gives Nora\r\na coach-and-six; he is to sell out, and Lieutenant Ulick Brady of the\r\nMilitia is to purchase his company. That coward of a fellow has been the\r\nmaking of your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s family. \xe2\x80\x98Faith! the business was well done.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nthen, laughing, he told me how Mick and Ulick had never let him out\r\nof their sight, although he was for deserting to England, until the\r\nmarriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you in want of cash, my boy?\xe2\x80\x99 continued the good-natured Captain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Quin\r\nfor my share, and while they last you shall never want.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd so he bade me sit down and write a letter to my mother, which I did\r\nforthwith in very sincere and repentant terms, stating that I had been\r\nguilty of extravagances, that I had not known until that moment under\r\nwhat a fatal error I had been labouring, and that I had embarked for\r\nGermany as a volunteer. The letter was scarcely finished when the pilot\r\nsang out that he was going on shore; and he departed, taking with him,\r\nfrom many an anxious fellow besides myself, our adieux to friends in old\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was called Captain Barry for many years of my life, and have\r\nbeen known as such by the first people of Europe, yet I may as well\r\nconfess I had no more claim to the title than many a gentleman who\r\nassumes it, and never had a right to an epaulet, or to any military\r\ndecoration higher than a corporal\xe2\x80\x99s stripe of worsted. I was made\r\ncorporal by Fagan during our voyage to the Elbe, and my rank was\r\nconfirmed on TERRA FIRMA. I was promised a halbert, too, and afterwards,\r\nperhaps, an ensigncy, if I distinguished myself; but Fate did not intend\r\nthat I should remain long an English soldier: as shall appear presently.\r\nMeanwhile, our passage was very favourable; my adventures were told\r\nby Fagan to his brother officers, who treated me with kindness; and my\r\nvictory over the big chairman procured me respect from my comrades of\r\nthe fore-deck. Encouraged and strongly exhorted by Fagan, I did my duty\r\nresolutely; but, though affable and good-humoured with the men, I never\r\nat first condescended to associate with such low fellows: and, indeed,\r\nwas called generally amongst them \xe2\x80\x98my Lord.\xe2\x80\x99 I believe it was the\r\nex-link-boy, a facetious knave, who gave me the title; and I felt that I\r\nshould become such a rank as well as any peer in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt would require a greater philosopher and historian than I am to\r\nexplain the causes of the famous Seven Years\xe2\x80\x99 War in which Europe was\r\nengaged; and, indeed, its origin has always appeared to me to be\r\nso complicated, and the books written about it so amazingly hard to\r\nunderstand, that I have seldom been much wiser at the end of a chapter\r\nthan at the beginning, and so shall not trouble my reader with any\r\npersonal disquisitions concerning the matter. All I know is, that after\r\nHis Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s love of his Hanoverian dominions had rendered him most\r\nunpopular in his English kingdom, with Mr. Pitt at the head of the\r\nanti-German war-party, all of a sudden, Mr. Pitt becoming Minister,\r\nthe rest of the empire applauded the war as much as they had hated it\r\nbefore. The victories of Dettingen and Crefeld were in every-body\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouths, and \xe2\x80\x98the Protestant hero,\xe2\x80\x99 as we used to call the godless old\r\nFrederick of Prussia, was adored by us as a saint, a very short time\r\nafter we had been about to make war against him in alliance with the\r\nEmpress-queen. Now, somehow, we were on Frederick\xe2\x80\x99s side: the Empress,\r\nthe French, the Swedes, and the Russians, were leagued against us; and\r\nI remember, when the news of the battle of Lissa came even to our remote\r\nquarter of Ireland, we considered it as a triumph for the cause of\r\nProtestantism, and illuminated and bonfired, and had a sermon at church,\r\nand kept the Prussian king\xe2\x80\x99s birthday; on which my uncle would get\r\ndrunk: as indeed on any other occasion. Most of the low fellows enlisted\r\nwith myself were, of course, Papists (the English army was filled with\r\nsuch, out of that never-failing country of ours), and these, forsooth,\r\nwere fighting the battles of Protestantism with Frederick; who was\r\nbelabouring the Protestant Swedes and the Protestant Saxons, as well as\r\nthe Russians of the Greek Church, and the Papist troops of the Emperor\r\nand the King of France. It was against these latter that the English\r\nauxiliaries were employed, and we know that, be the quarrel what it may,\r\nan Englishman and a Frenchman are pretty willing to make a fight of it.\r\n\r\nWe landed at Cuxhaven, and before I had been a month in the Electorate\r\nI was transformed into a tall and proper young soldier, and having a\r\nnatural aptitude for military exercise, was soon as accomplished at the\r\ndrill as the oldest sergeant in the regiment. It is well, however, to\r\ndream of glorious war in a snug arm-chair at home; ay, or to make it as\r\nan officer, surrounded by gentlemen, gorgeously dressed, and cheered by\r\nchances of promotion. But those chances do not shine on poor fellows in\r\nworsted lace: the rough texture of our red coats made me ashamed when I\r\nsaw an officer go by; my soul used to shudder when, on going the rounds,\r\nI would hear their voices as they sat jovially over the mess-table;\r\nmy pride revolted at being obliged to plaster my hair with flour and\r\ncandle-grease, instead of using the proper pomatum for a gentleman.\r\nYes, my tastes have always been high and fashionable, and I loathed the\r\nhorrid company in which I was fallen. What chances had I of promotion?\r\nNone of my relatives had money to buy me a commission, and I became soon\r\nso low-spirited, that I longed for a general action and a ball to finish\r\nme, and vowed that I would take some opportunity to desert.\r\n\r\nWhen I think that I, the descendant of the kings of Ireland, was\r\nthreatened with a caning by a young scoundrel who had just joined from\r\nEton College--when I think that he offered to make me his footman, and\r\nthat I did not, on either occasion, murder him! On the first occasion I\r\nburst into tears (I do not care to own it) and had serious thoughts of\r\ncommitting suicide, so great was my mortification. But my kind friend\r\nFagan came to my aid in the circumstance, with some very timely\r\nconsolation. \xe2\x80\x98My poor boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98you must not take the matter to\r\nheart so. Caning is only a relative disgrace. Young Ensign Fakenham was\r\nflogged himself at Eton School only a month ago: I would lay a wager\r\nthat his scars are not yet healed. You must cheer up, my boy; do your\r\nduty, be a gentleman, and no serious harm can fall on you.\xe2\x80\x99 And I heard\r\nafterwards that my champion had taken Mr. Fakenham very severely to\r\ntask for this threat, and said to him that any such proceedings for the\r\nfuture he should consider as an insult to himself; whereon the young\r\nensign was, for the moment, civil. As for the sergeants, I told one of\r\nthem, that if any man struck me, no matter who he might be, or what\r\nthe penalty, I would take his life. And, \xe2\x80\x98faith! there was an air of\r\nsincerity in my speech which convinced the whole bevy of them; and as\r\nlong as I remained in the English service no rattan was ever laid on the\r\nshoulders of Redmond Barry. Indeed, I was in that savage moody state,\r\nthat my mind was quite made up to the point, and I looked to hear my own\r\ndead march played as sure as I was alive. When I was made a corporal,\r\nsome of my evils were lessened; I messed with the sergeants by special\r\nfavour, and used to treat them to drink, and lose money to the rascals\r\nat play: with which cash my good friend Mr. Fagan punctually supplied\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOur regiment, which was quartered about Stade and Luneburg, speedily\r\ngot orders to march southwards towards the Rhine, for news came that our\r\ngreat General, Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, had been defeated--no, not\r\ndefeated, but foiled in his attack upon the French under the Duke of\r\nBroglio, at Bergen, near Frankfort-on-the-Main, and had been obliged to\r\nfall back. As the allies retreated the French rushed forward, and made\r\na bold push for the Electorate of our gracious monarch in Hanover,\r\nthreatening that they would occupy it; as they had done before, when\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Estrees beat the hero of Culloden, the gallant Duke of Cumberland, and\r\ncaused him to sign the capitulation of Closter Zeven. An advance upon\r\nHanover always caused a great agitation in the Royal bosom of the King\r\nof England; more troops were sent to join us, convoys of treasure were\r\npassed over to our forces, and to our ally\xe2\x80\x99s the King of Prussia; and\r\nalthough, in spite of all assistance, the army under Prince Ferdinand\r\nwas very much weaker than that of the invading enemy, yet we had the\r\nadvantage of better supplies, one of the greatest Generals in the world:\r\nand, I was going to add, of British valour, but the less we say about\r\nTHAT the better. My Lord George Sackville did not exactly cover himself\r\nwith laurels at Minden; otherwise there might have been won there one of\r\nthe greatest victories of modern times.\r\n\r\nThrowing himself between the French and the interior of the Electorate,\r\nPrince Ferdinand wisely took possession of the free town of Bremen,\r\nwhich he made his storehouse and place of arms; and round which he\r\ngathered all his troops, making ready to fight the famous battle of\r\nMinden.\r\n\r\nWere these Memoirs not characterised by truth, and did I deign to utter\r\na single word for which my own personal experience did not give me the\r\nfullest authority, I might easily make myself the hero of some strange\r\nand popular adventures, and, after the fashion of novel-writers,\r\nintroduce my reader to the great characters of this remarkable time.\r\nThese persons (I mean the romance-writers), if they take a drummer or\r\na dustman for a hero, somehow manage to bring him in contact with\r\nthe greatest lords and most notorious personages of the empire; and\r\nI warrant me there\xe2\x80\x99s not one of them but, in describing the battle\r\nof Minden, would manage to bring Prince Ferdinand, and my Lord George\r\nSackville, and my Lord Granby, into presence. It would have been easy\r\nfor me to have SAID I was present when the orders were brought to Lord\r\nGeorge to charge with the cavalry and finish the rout of the Frenchmen,\r\nand when he refused to do so, and thereby spoiled the great victory. But\r\nthe fact is, I was two miles off from the cavalry when his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfatal hesitation took place, and none of us soldiers of the line knew of\r\nwhat had occurred until we came to talk about the fight over our kettles\r\nin the evening, and repose after the labours of a hard-fought day. I saw\r\nno one of higher rank that day than my colonel and a couple of orderly\r\nofficers riding by in the smoke--no one on our side, that is. A poor\r\ncorporal (as I then had the disgrace of being) is not generally invited\r\ninto the company of commanders and the great; but, in revenge, I saw,\r\nI promise you, some very good company on the FRENCH part, for their\r\nregiments of Lorraine and Royal Cravate were charging us all day; and\r\nin THAT sort of MELEE high and low are pretty equally received. I hate\r\nbragging, but I cannot help saying that I made a very close acquaintance\r\nwith the colonel of the Cravates; for I drove my bayonet into his body,\r\nand finished off a poor little ensign, so young, slender, and small,\r\nthat a blow from my pigtail would have despatched him, I think, in\r\nplace of the butt of my musket, with which I clubbed him down. I killed,\r\nbesides, four more officers and men, and in the poor ensign\xe2\x80\x99s pocket\r\nfound a purse of fourteen louis-d\xe2\x80\x99or, and a silver box of sugar-plums;\r\nof which the former present was very agreeable to me. If people would\r\ntell their stories of battles in this simple way, I think the cause of\r\ntruth would not suffer by it. All I know of this famous fight of Minden\r\n(except from books) is told here above. The ensign\xe2\x80\x99s silver bon-bon box\r\nand his purse of gold; the livid face of the poor fellow as he fell;\r\nthe huzzas of the men of my company as I went out under a smart fire\r\nand rifled him; their shouts and curses as we came hand in hand with the\r\nFrenchmen,--these are, in truth, not very dignified recollections, and\r\nhad best be passed over briefly. When my kind friend Fagan was shot, a\r\nbrother captain, and his very good friend, turned to Lieutenant Rawson\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98Fagan\xe2\x80\x99s down; Rawson, there\xe2\x80\x99s your company.\xe2\x80\x99 It was all the\r\nepitaph my brave patron got. \xe2\x80\x98I should have left you a hundred guineas,\r\nRedmond,\xe2\x80\x99 were his last words to me, \xe2\x80\x98but for a cursed run of ill luck\r\nlast night at faro.\xe2\x80\x99 And he gave me a faint squeeze of the hand; then,\r\nas the word was given to advance, I left him. When we came back to our\r\nold ground, which we presently did, he was lying there still; but he\r\nwas dead. Some of our people had already torn off his epaulets, and,\r\nno doubt, had rifled his purse. Such knaves and ruffians do men in war\r\nbecome! It is well for gentlemen to talk of the age of chivalry; but\r\nremember the starving brutes whom they lead--men nursed in poverty,\r\nentirely ignorant, made to take a pride in deeds of blood--men who can\r\nhave no amusement but in drunkenness, debauch, and plunder. It is with\r\nthese shocking instruments that your great warriors and kings have been\r\ndoing their murderous work in the world; and while, for instance, we are\r\nat the present moment admiring the \xe2\x80\x98Great Frederick,\xe2\x80\x99 as we call him,\r\nand his philosophy, and his liberality, and his military genius, I, who\r\nhave served him, and been, as it were, behind the scenes of which that\r\ngreat spectacle is composed, can only look at it with horror. What\r\na number of items of human crime, misery, slavery, go to form that\r\nsum-total of glory! I can recollect a certain day about three weeks\r\nafter the battle of Minden, and a farmhouse in which some of us entered;\r\nand how the old woman and her daughters served us, trembling, to wine;\r\nand how we got drunk over the wine, and the house was in a flame,\r\npresently; and woe betide the wretched fellow afterwards who came home\r\nto look for his house and his children!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. BARRY FAR FROM MILITARY GLORY\r\n\r\nAfter the death of my protector, Captain Fagan, I am forced to confess\r\nthat I fell into the very worst of courses and company. Being a rough\r\nsoldier of fortune himself, he had never been a favourite with the\r\nofficers of his regiment; who had a contempt for Irishmen, as Englishmen\r\nsometimes will have, and used to mock his brogue, and his blunt uncouth\r\nmanners. I had been insolent to one or two of them, and had only been\r\nscreened from punishment by his intercession; especially his successor,\r\nMr. Rawson, had no liking for me, and put another man into the\r\nsergeant\xe2\x80\x99s place vacant in his company after the battle of Minden.\r\nThis act of injustice rendered my service very disagreeable to me; and,\r\ninstead of seeking to conquer the dislike of my superiors, and win their\r\ngoodwill by good behaviour, I only sought for means to make my situation\r\neasier to me, and grasped at all the amusements in my power. In a\r\nforeign country, with the enemy before us, and the people continually\r\nunder contribution from one side or the other, numberless irregularities\r\nwere permitted to the troops which would not have been allowed in more\r\npeaceable times. I descended gradually to mix with the sergeants, and to\r\nshare their amusements: drinking and gambling were, I am sorry to say,\r\nour principal pastimes; and I fell so readily into their ways, that\r\nthough only a young lad of seventeen, I was the master of them all in\r\ndaring wickedness; though there were some among them who, I promise you,\r\nwere far advanced in the science of every kind of profligacy. I should\r\nhave been under the provost-marshal\xe2\x80\x99s hands, for a dead certainty, had\r\nI continued much longer in the army: but an accident occurred which took\r\nme out of the English service in rather a singular manner.\r\n\r\nThe year in which George II died, our regiment had the honour to be\r\npresent at the battle of Warburg (where the Marquis of Granby and his\r\nhorse fully retrieved the discredit which had fallen upon the cavalry\r\nsince Lord George Sackville\xe2\x80\x99s defalcation at Minden), and where Prince\r\nFerdinand once more completely defeated the Frenchmen. During the\r\naction, my lieutenant, Mr. Fakenham, of Fakenham, the gentleman who had\r\nthreatened me, it may be remembered, with the caning, was struck by a\r\nmusket-ball in the side. He had shown no want of courage in this or any\r\nother occasion where he had been called upon to act against the French;\r\nbut this was his first wound, and the young gentleman was exceedingly\r\nfrightened by it. He offered five guineas to be carried into the town,\r\nwhich was hard by; and I and another man, taking him up in a cloak,\r\nmanaged to transport him into a place of decent appearance, where we put\r\nhim to bed, and where a young surgeon (who desired nothing better than\r\nto take himself out of the fire of the musketry) went presently to dress\r\nhis wound.\r\n\r\nIn order to get into the house, we had been obliged, it must be\r\nconfessed, to fire into the locks with our pieces; which summons brought\r\nan inhabitant of the house to the door, a very pretty and black-eyed\r\nyoung woman, who lived there with her old half-blind father, a retired\r\nJagdmeister of the Duke of Cassel, hard by. When the French were in the\r\ntown, Meinherr\xe2\x80\x99s house had suffered like those of his neighbours; and\r\nhe was at first exceedingly unwilling to accommodate his guests. But the\r\nfirst knocking at the door had the effect of bringing a speedy answer;\r\nand Mr. Fakenham, taking a couple of guineas out of a very full purse,\r\nspeedily convinced the people that they had only to deal with a person\r\nof honour.\r\n\r\nLeaving the doctor (who was very glad to stop) with his patient, who\r\npaid me the stipulated reward, I was returning to my regiment with my\r\nother comrade--after having paid, in my German jargon, some deserved\r\ncompliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, and thinking, with no\r\nsmall envy, how comfortable it would be to be billeted there--when the\r\nprivate who was with me cut short my reveries by suggesting that we\r\nshould divide the five guineas the lieutenant had given me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is your share,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, giving the fellow one piece; which was\r\nplenty, as I was the leader of the expedition. But he swore a dreadful\r\noath that he would have half; and when I told him to go to a quarter\r\nwhich I shall not name, the fellow, lifting his musket, hit me a blow\r\nwith the butt-end of it, which sent me lifeless to the ground: when I\r\nawoke from my trance, I found myself bleeding with a large wound in the\r\nhead, and had barely time to stagger back to the house where I had left\r\nthe lieutenant, when I again fell fainting at the door.\r\n\r\nHere I must have been discovered by the surgeon on his issuing out; for\r\nwhen I awoke a second time I found myself in the ground-floor of the\r\nhouse, supported by the black-eyed girl, while the surgeon was copiously\r\nbleeding me at the arm. There was another bed in the room where the\r\nlieutenant had been laid,--it was that occupied by Gretel, the servant;\r\nwhile Lischen, as my fair one was called, had, till now, slept in the\r\ncouch where the wounded officer lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who are you putting into that bed?\xe2\x80\x99 said he languidly, in German; for\r\nthe ball had been extracted from his side with much pain and loss of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThey told him it was the corporal who had brought him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A corporal?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in English; \xe2\x80\x98turn him out.\xe2\x80\x99 And you may be sure\r\nI felt highly complimented by the words. But we were both too faint to\r\ncompliment or to abuse each other much, and I was put to bed carefully;\r\nand, on being undressed, had an opportunity to find that my pockets\r\nhad been rifled by the English soldier after he had knocked me down.\r\nHowever, I was in good quarters: the young lady who sheltered me\r\npresently brought me a refreshing drink; and, as I took it, I could not\r\nhelp pressing the kind hand that gave it me; nor, in truth, did this\r\ntoken of my gratitude seem unwelcome.\r\n\r\nThis intimacy did not decrease with further acquaintance. I found\r\nLischen the tenderest of nurses. Whenever any delicacy was to be\r\nprovided for the wounded lieutenant, a share was always sent to the\r\nbed opposite his, and to the avaricious man\xe2\x80\x99s no small annoyance. His\r\nillness was long. On the second day the fever declared itself; for some\r\nnights he was delirious; and I remember it was when a commanding\r\nofficer was inspecting our quarters, with an intention, very likely, of\r\nbilleting himself on the house, that the howling and mad words of the\r\npatient overhead struck him, and he retired rather frightened. I had\r\nbeen sitting up very comfortably in the lower apartment, for my hurt was\r\nquite subsided; and it was only when the officer asked me, with a\r\nrough voice, why I was not at my regiment, that I began to reflect how\r\npleasant my quarters were to me, and that I was much better here than\r\ncrawling under an odious tent with a parcel of tipsy soldiers, or going\r\nthe night-rounds or rising long before daybreak for drill.\r\n\r\nThe delirium of Mr. Fakenham gave me a hint, and I determined forthwith\r\nto GO MAD. There was a poor fellow about Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town called \xe2\x80\x98Wandering\r\nBilly,\xe2\x80\x99 whose insane pranks I had often mimicked as a lad, and I\r\nagain put them in practice. That night I made an attempt upon Lischen,\r\nsaluting her with a yell and a grin which frightened her almost out of\r\nher wits; and when anybody came I was raving. The blow on the head had\r\ndisordered my brain; the doctor was ready to vouch for this fact. One\r\nnight I whispered to him that I was Julius Caesar, and considered him\r\nto be my affianced wife Queen Cleopatra, which convinced him of my\r\ninsanity. Indeed, if Her Majesty had been like my Aesculapius, she must\r\nhave had a carroty beard, such as is rare in Egypt.\r\n\r\nA movement on the part of the French speedily caused an advance on our\r\npart. The town was evacuated, except by a few Prussian troops, whose\r\nsurgeons were to visit the wounded in the place; and, when we were well,\r\nwe were to be drafted to our regiments. I determined that I never would\r\njoin mine again. My intention was to make for Holland, almost the only\r\nneutral country of Europe in those times, and thence to get a passage\r\nsomehow to England, and home to dear old Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Fakenham is now alive, I here tender him my apologies for my\r\nconduct to him. He was very rich; he used me very ill. I managed to\r\nfrighten away his servant who came to attend him after the affair of\r\nWarburg, and from that time would sometimes condescend to wait upon the\r\npatient, who always treated me with scorn; but it was my object to\r\nhave him alone, and I bore his brutality with the utmost civility and\r\nmildness, meditating in my own mind a very pretty return for all his\r\nfavours to me. Nor was I the only person in the house to whom the worthy\r\ngentleman was uncivil. He ordered the fair Lischen hither and thither,\r\nmade impertinent love to her, abused her soups, quarrelled with her\r\nomelettes, and grudged the money which was laid out for his maintenance;\r\nso that our hostess detested him as much as, I think, without vanity,\r\nshe regarded me.\r\n\r\nFor, if the truth must be told, I had made very deep love to her during\r\nmy stay under her roof; as is always my way with women, of whatever\r\nage or degree of beauty. To a man who has to make his way in the world,\r\nthese dear girls can always be useful in one fashion or another; never\r\nmind, if they repel your passion; at any rate, they are not offended\r\nwith your declaration of it, and only look upon you with more favourable\r\neyes in consequence of your misfortune. As for Lischen, I told her such\r\na pathetic story of my life (a tale a great deal more romantic than that\r\nhere narrated,--for I did not restrict myself to the exact truth in that\r\nhistory, as in these pages I am bound to do), that I won the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart entirely, and, besides, made considerable progress in the\r\nGerman language under her instruction. Do not think me very cruel and\r\nheartless, ladies; this heart of Lischen\xe2\x80\x99s was like many a town in the\r\nneighbourhood in which she dwelt, and had been stormed and occupied\r\nseveral times before I came to invest it; now mounting French colours,\r\nnow green and yellow Saxon, now black and white Prussian, as the case\r\nmay be. A lady who sets her heart upon a lad in uniform must prepare to\r\nchange lovers pretty quickly, or her life will be but a sad one.\r\n\r\nThe German surgeon who attended us after the departure of the English\r\nonly condescended to pay our house a visit twice during my residence;\r\nand I took care, for a reason I had, to receive him in a darkened room,\r\nmuch to the annoyance of Mr. Fakenham, who lay there: but I said the\r\nlight affected my eyes dreadfully since my blow on the head; and so I\r\ncovered up my head with clothes when the doctor came, and told him that\r\nI was an Egyptian mummy, or talked to him some insane nonsense, in order\r\nto keep up my character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is that nonsense you were talking about an Egyptian mummy,\r\nfellow?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Fakenham peevishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you\xe2\x80\x99ll know soon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\nThe next time that I expected the doctor to come, instead of receiving\r\nhim in a darkened room, with handkerchiefs muffled, I took care to be\r\nin the lower room, and was having a game at cards with Lischen as the\r\nsurgeon entered. I had taken possession of a dressing-jacket of the\r\nlieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s, and some other articles of his wardrobe, which fitted me\r\npretty well; and, I flatter myself, was no ungentlemanlike figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-morrow, Corporal,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, rather gruffly, in reply to my\r\nsmiling salute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Corporal! Lieutenant, if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 answered I, giving an arch look\r\nat Lischen, whom I had instructed in my plot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How lieutenant?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the surgeon. \xe2\x80\x98I thought the lieutenant was\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, you do me great honour,\xe2\x80\x99 cried I, laughing; \xe2\x80\x98you mistook\r\nme for the mad corporal upstairs. The fellow has once or twice pretended\r\nto be an officer, but my kind hostess here can answer which is which.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yesterday he fancied he was Prince Ferdinand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lischen; \xe2\x80\x98the day\r\nyou came he said he was an Egyptian mummy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So he did,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x98I remember; but, ha! ha! do you know,\r\nLieutenant, I have in my notes made a mistake in you two?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me about his malady; he is calm now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLischen and I laughed at this error as at the most ridiculous thing\r\nin the world; and when the surgeon went up to examine his patient, I\r\ncautioned him not to talk to him about the subject of his malady, for he\r\nwas in a very excited state.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be able to gather from the above conversation what my\r\ndesign really was. I was determined to escape, and to escape under the\r\ncharacter of Lieutenant Fakenham; taking it from him to his face, as\r\nit were, and making use of it to meet my imperious necessity. It\r\nwas forgery and robbery, if you like; for I took all his money and\r\nclothes,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to conceal it; but the need was so urgent, that\r\nI would do so again: and I knew I could not effect my escape without his\r\npurse, as well as his name. Hence it became my duty to take possession\r\nof one and the other.\r\n\r\nAs the lieutenant lay still in bed upstairs, I did not hesitate at\r\nall about assuming his uniform, especially after taking care to inform\r\nmyself from the doctor whether any men of ours who might know me were in\r\nthe town. But there were none that I could hear of; and so I calmly took\r\nmy walks with Madame Lischen, dressed in the lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s uniform, made\r\ninquiries as to a horse that I wanted to purchase, reported myself to\r\nthe commandant of the place as Lieutenant Fakenham, of Gale\xe2\x80\x99s English\r\nregiment of foot, convalescent, and was asked to dine with the officers\r\nof the Prussian regiment at a very sorry mess they had. How Fakenham\r\nwould have stormed and raged, had he known the use I was making of his\r\nname!\r\n\r\nWhenever that worthy used to inquire about his clothes, which he did\r\nwith many oaths and curses that he would have me caned at the regiment\r\nfor inattention, I, with a most respectful air, informed him that they\r\nwere put away in perfect safety below; and, in fact, had them very\r\nneatly packed, and ready for the day when I proposed to depart. His\r\npapers and money, however, he kept under his pillow; and, as I had\r\npurchased a horse, it became necessary to pay for it.\r\n\r\nAt a certain hour, then, I ordered the animal to be brought round, when\r\nI would pay the dealer for him. (I shall pass over my adieux with my\r\nkind hostess, which were very tearful indeed). And then, making up my\r\nmind to the great action, walked upstairs to Fakenham\xe2\x80\x99s room attired in\r\nhis full regimentals, and with his hat cocked over my left eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You gWeat scoundWel!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, with a multiplicity of oaths; \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmutinous dog! what do you mean by dWessing yourself in my Wegimentals?\r\nAs sure as my name\xe2\x80\x99s Fakenham, when we get back to the Wegiment, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave your soul cut out of your body.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m promoted, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, with a sneer. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m come to take my\r\nleave of you;\xe2\x80\x99 and then going up to his bed, I said, \xe2\x80\x98I intend to have\r\nyour papers and purse.\xe2\x80\x99 With this I put my hand under his pillow; at\r\nwhich he gave a scream that might have called the whole garrison about\r\nmy ears. \xe2\x80\x98Hark ye, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98no more noise, or you are a dead\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x99 and taking a handkerchief, I bound it tight around his mouth so\r\nas well-nigh to throttle him, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his\r\nshirt, tied them in a knot together, and so left him; removing the\r\npapers and the purse, you may be sure, and wishing him politely a good\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the mad corporal,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to the people down below who were\r\nattracted by the noise from the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s chamber; and so taking leave\r\nof the old blind Jagdmeister, and an adieu (I will not say how tender)\r\nof his daughter, I mounted my newly purchased animal; and, as I pranced\r\naway, and the sentinels presented arms to me at the town-gates, felt\r\nonce more that I was in my proper sphere, and determined never again to\r\nfall from the rank of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nI took at first the way towards Bremen, where our army was, and gave out\r\nthat I was bringing reports and letters from the Prussian commandant\r\nof Warburg to headquarters; but, as soon as I got out of sight of the\r\nadvanced sentinels, I turned bridle and rode into the Hesse-Cassel\r\nterritory, which is luckily not very far from Warburg: and I promise you\r\nI was very glad to see the blue-and-red stripes on the barriers, which\r\nshowed me that I was out of the land occupied by our countrymen. I rode\r\nto Hof, and the next day to Cassel, giving out that I was the bearer of\r\ndespatches to Prince Henry, then on the Lower Rhine, and put up at the\r\nbest hotel of the place, where the field-officers of the garrison had\r\ntheir ordinary. These gentlemen I treated to the best wines that the\r\nhouse afforded, for I was determined to keep up the character of the\r\nEnglish gentleman, and I talked to them about my English estates with a\r\nfluency that almost made me believe in the stories which I invented. I\r\nwas even asked to an assembly at Wilhelmshohe, the Elector\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and\r\ndanced a minuet there with the Hofmarshal\xe2\x80\x99s lovely daughter, and lost a\r\nfew pieces to his excellency the first huntmaster of his Highness.\r\n\r\nAt our table at the inn there was a Prussian officer who treated me with\r\ngreat civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England; which\r\nI answered as best I might. But this best, I am bound to say, was bad\r\nenough. I knew nothing about England, and the Court, and the noble\r\nfamilies there; but, led away by the vaingloriousness of youth (and a\r\npropensity which I possessed in my early days, but of which I have long\r\nsince corrected myself, to boast and talk in a manner not altogether\r\nconsonant with truth), I invented a thousand stories which I told him;\r\ndescribed the King and the Ministers to him, said the British Ambassador\r\nat Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of\r\nrecommendation to him. When the officer asked me my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s name, I was\r\nnot able to give him the real name, and so said his name was O\xe2\x80\x99Grady: it\r\nis as good a name as any other, and those of Kilballyowen, county\r\nCork, are as good a family as any in the world, as I have heard. As for\r\nstories about my regiment, of these, of course, I had no lack. I wish my\r\nother histories had been equally authentic.\r\n\r\nOn the morning I left Cassel, my Prussian friend came to me with an open\r\nsmiling countenance, and said he, too, was bound for Dusseldorf, whither\r\nI said my route lay; and so laying our horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads together we jogged\r\non. The country was desolate beyond description. The prince in whose\r\ndominions we were was known to be the most ruthless seller of men in\r\nGermany. He would sell to any bidder, and during the five years which\r\nthe war (afterwards called the Seven Years\xe2\x80\x99 War) had now lasted, had\r\nso exhausted the males of his principality, that the fields remained\r\nuntilled: even the children of twelve years old were driven off to the\r\nwar, and I saw herds of these wretches marching forwards, attended by\r\na few troopers, now under the guidance of a red-coated Hanovarian\r\nsergeant, now with a Prussian sub-officer accompanying them; with some\r\nof whom my companion exchanged signs of recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It hurts my feelings,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98to be obliged to commune with such\r\nwretches; but the stern necessities of war demand men continually, and\r\nhence these recruiters whom you see market in human flesh. They get\r\nfive-and-twenty dollars from our Government for every man they bring\r\nin. For fine men--for men like you,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98we would go as\r\nhigh as a hundred. In the old King\xe2\x80\x99s time we would have given a thousand\r\nfor you, when he had his giant regiment that our present monarch\r\ndisbanded.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew one of them,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98who served with you: we used to call him\r\nMorgan Prussia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed; and who was this Morgan Prussia?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, a huge grenadier of ours, who was somehow snapped up in Hanover by\r\nsome of your recruiters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The rascals!\xe2\x80\x99 said my friend: \xe2\x80\x98and did they dare take an Englishman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith this was an Irishman, and a great deal too sharp for them;\r\nas you shall hear. Morgan was taken, then, and drafted into the giant\r\nguard, and was the biggest man almost among all the giants there. Many\r\nof these monsters used to complain of their life, and their caning, and\r\ntheir long drills, and their small pay; but Morgan was not one of the\r\ngrumblers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a deal better,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto get fat here in Berlin,\r\nthan to starve in rags in Tipperary!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is Tipperary?\xe2\x80\x99 asked my companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is exactly what Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s friends asked him. It is a beautiful\r\ndistrict in Ireland, the capital of which is the magnificent city of\r\nClonmel: a city, let me tell you, sir, only inferior to Dublin and\r\nLondon, and far more sumptuous than any on the Continent. Well, Morgan\r\nsaid that his birthplace was near that city, and the only thing which\r\ncaused him unhappiness, in his present situation, was the thought that\r\nhis brothers were still starving at home, when they might be so much\r\nbetter off in His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Faith,\xe2\x80\x9d says Morgan to the sergeant, to whom he imparted the\r\ninformation, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my brother Bin that would make the fine sergeant of\r\nthe guards, entirely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIs Ben as tall as you are?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAs tall as ME, is it? Why, man, I\xe2\x80\x99m the shortest of my family! There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsix more of us, but Bin\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest of all. Oh! out and out the\r\nbiggest. Seven feet in his stockin-FUT, as sure as my name\xe2\x80\x99s Morgan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we send and fetch them over, these brothers of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNot you. Ever since I was seduced by one of you gentlemen of the cane,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve a mortal aversion to all sergeants,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Morgan: \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a pity they cannot come, too. What a monster Bin would be in a\r\ngrenadier\xe2\x80\x99s cap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He said nothing more at the time regarding his brothers, but only\r\nsighed as if lamenting their hard fate. However, the story was told by\r\nthe sergeant to the officers, and by the officers to the King himself;\r\nand His Majesty was so inflamed by curiosity, that he actually consented\r\nto let Morgan go home in order to bring back with him his seven enormous\r\nbrothers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And were they as big as Morgan pretended?\xe2\x80\x99 asked my comrade. I could\r\nnot help laughing at his simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 cried I, \xe2\x80\x98that Morgan ever came back? No, no; once\r\nfree, he was too wise for that. He has bought a snug farm in Tipperary\r\nwith the money that was given him to secure his brothers; and I fancy\r\nfew men of the guards ever profited so much by it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Prussian captain laughed exceedingly at this story, said that the\r\nEnglish were the cleverest nation in the world, and, on my setting him\r\nright, agreed that the Irish were even more so. We rode on very well\r\npleased with each other; for he had a thousand stories of the war to\r\ntell, of the skill and gallantry of Frederick, and the thousand escapes,\r\nand victories, and defeats scarcely less glorious than victories,\r\nthrough which the King had passed. Now that I was a gentleman, I could\r\nlisten with admiration to these tales: and yet the sentiment recorded\r\nat the end of the last chapter was uppermost in my mind but three weeks\r\nback, when I remembered that it was the great general got the glory, and\r\nthe poor soldier only insult and the cane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the way, to whom are you taking despatches?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the officer.\r\n\r\nIt was another ugly question, which I determined to answer at\r\nhap-hazard; and so I said \xe2\x80\x98To General Rolls.\xe2\x80\x99 I had seen the general\r\na year before, and gave the first name in my head. My friend was quite\r\nsatisfied with it, and we continued our ride until evening came on; and\r\nour horses being weary, it was agreed that we should come to a halt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is a very good inn,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain, as we rode up to what\r\nappeared to me a very lonely-looking place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This may be a very good inn for Germany,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98but it would not\r\npass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off: let us push on for\r\nCorbach.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?\xe2\x80\x99 said the officer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you sly rogue, I see THAT will influence you;\xe2\x80\x99 and, truth to say,\r\nsuch a proposal WAS always welcome to me, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to own. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\npeople are great farmers,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x98as well as innkeepers;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand, indeed, the place seemed more a farm than an inn yard. We entered\r\nby a great gate into a Court walled round, and at one end of which was\r\nthe building, a dingy ruinous place. A couple of covered waggens were in\r\nthe court, their horses were littered under a shed hard by, and lounging\r\nabout the place were some men and a pair of sergeants in the Prussian\r\nuniform, who both touched their hats to my friend the Captain. This\r\ncustomary formality struck me as nothing extraordinary, but the aspect\r\nof the inn had something exceedingly chilling and forbidding in it,\r\nand I observed the men shut to the great yard-gates as soon as we were\r\nentered. Parties of French horsemen, the Captain said, were about\r\nthe country, and one could not take too many precautions against such\r\nvillains.\r\n\r\nWe went into supper, after the two sergeants had taken charge of our\r\nhorses; the Captain, also, ordering one of them to take my valise to my\r\nbedroom. I promised the worthy fellow a glass of schnapps for his pains.\r\n\r\nA dish of fried eggs-and-bacon was ordered from a hideous old wench that\r\ncame to serve us, in place of the lovely creature I had expected to see;\r\nand the Captain, laughing, said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, our meal is a frugal one, but a\r\nsoldier has many a time a worse:\xe2\x80\x99 and, taking off his hat, sword-belt,\r\nand gloves, with great ceremony, he sat down to eat. I would not be\r\nbehindhand with him in politeness, and put my weapon securely on the old\r\nchest of drawers where his was laid.\r\n\r\nThe hideous old woman before mentioned brought us in a pot of very sour\r\nwine, at which and at her ugliness I felt a considerable ill-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty you promised me?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, as soon as the old hag had\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bah!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, laughing, and looking hard at me: \xe2\x80\x98it was my joke. I was\r\ntired, and did not care to go farther. There\xe2\x80\x99s no prettier woman here\r\nthan that. If she won\xe2\x80\x99t suit your fancy, my friend, you must wait a\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis increased my ill-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I sternly, \xe2\x80\x98I think you have acted very\r\ncoolly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have acted as I think fit!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a British officer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\xe2\x80\x99 roared the other, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a DESERTER! You\xe2\x80\x99re an impostor,\r\nsir; I have known you for such these three hours. I suspected you\r\nyesterday. My men heard of a man escaping from Warburg, and I thought\r\nyou were the man. Your lies and folly have confirmed me. You pretend to\r\ncarry despatches to a general who has been dead these ten months: you\r\nhave an uncle who is an ambassador, and whose name forsooth you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. Will you join and take the bounty, sir; or will you be given up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, springing at him like a tiger. But, agile as I was,\r\nhe was equally on his guard. He took two pistols out of his pocket,\r\nfired one off, and said, from the other end of the table where he stood\r\ndodging me, as it were,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Advance a step, and I send this bullet into your brains!\xe2\x80\x99 In another\r\nminute the door was flung open, and the two sergeants entered, armed\r\nwith musket and bayonet to aid their comrade.\r\n\r\nThe game was up. I flung down a knife with which I had armed myself; for\r\nthe old hag on bringing in the wine had removed my sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I volunteer,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s my good fellow. What name shall I put on my list?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Write Redmond Barry of Bally Barry,\xe2\x80\x99 said I haughtily; \xe2\x80\x98a descendant of\r\nthe Irish kings!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was once with the Irish brigade, Roche\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said the recruiter,\r\nsneering, \xe2\x80\x98trying if I could get any likely fellows among the few\r\ncountrymen of yours that are in the brigade, and there was scarcely one\r\nof them that was not descended from the kings of Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98king or not, I am a gentleman, as you can see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you will find plenty more in our corps,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Captain,\r\nstill in the sneering mood. \xe2\x80\x98Give up your papers, Mr. Gentleman, and let\r\nus see who you really are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs my pocket-book contained some bank-notes as well as papers of Mr.\r\nFakenham\xe2\x80\x99s, I was not willing to give up my property; suspecting very\r\nrightly that it was but a scheme on the part of the Captain to get and\r\nkeep it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It can matter very little to you,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98what my private papers are:\r\nI am enlisted under the name of Redmond Barry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give it up, sirrah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain, seizing his cane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not give it up!\xe2\x80\x99 answered I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98HOUND! do you mutiny?\xe2\x80\x99 screamed he, and, at the same time, gave me a\r\nlash across the face with the cane, which had the anticipated effect\r\nof producing a struggle. I dashed forward to grapple with him, the two\r\nsergeants flung themselves on me, I was thrown to the ground and\r\nstunned again; being hit on my former wound in the head. It was bleeding\r\nseverely when I came to myself, my laced coat was already torn off my\r\nback, my purse and papers gone, and my hands tied behind my back.\r\n\r\nThe great and illustrious Frederick had scores of these white\r\nslave-dealers all round the frontiers of his kingdom, debauching troops\r\nor kidnapping peasants, and hesitating at no crime to supply those\r\nbrilliant regiments of his with food for powder; and I cannot help\r\ntelling here, with some satisfaction, the fate which ultimately befell\r\nthe atrocious scoundrel who, violating all the rights of friendship and\r\ngood-fellowship, had just succeeded in entrapping me. This individual\r\nwas a person of high family and known talents and courage, but who had\r\na propensity to gambling and extravagance, and found his calling as a\r\nrecruit-decoy far more profitable to him than his pay of second captain\r\nin the line. The sovereign, too, probably found his services more useful\r\nin the former capacity. His name was Monsieur de Galgenstein, and he was\r\none of the most successful of the practisers of his rascally trade. He\r\nspoke all languages, and knew all countries, and hence had no difficulty\r\nin finding out the simple braggadocio of a young lad like me.\r\n\r\nAbout 1765, however, he came to his justly merited end. He was at this\r\ntime living at Kehl, opposite Strasburg, and used to take his walk upon\r\nthe bridge there, and get into conversation with the French advanced\r\nsentinels; to whom he was in the habit of promising \xe2\x80\x98mountains and\r\nmarvels,\xe2\x80\x99 as the French say, if they would take service in Prussia.\r\nOne day there was on the bridge a superb grenadier, whom Galgenstein\r\naccosted, and to whom he promised a company, at least, if he would\r\nenlist under Frederick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask my comrade yonder,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grenadier; \xe2\x80\x98I can do nothing without\r\nhim. We were born and bred together, we are of the same company, sleep\r\nin the same room, and always go in pairs. If he will go and you will\r\ngive him a captaincy, I will go too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bring your comrade over to Kehl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Galgenstein, delighted. \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\ngive you the best of dinners, and can promise to satisfy both of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had you not better speak to him on the bridge?\xe2\x80\x99 said the grenadier.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare not leave my post; but you have but to pass, and talk over the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGalgenstein, after a little parley, passed the sentinel; but presently a\r\npanic took him, and he retraced his steps. But the grenadier brought\r\nhis bayonet to the Prussian\xe2\x80\x99s breast and bade him stand: that he was his\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian, however, seeing his danger, made a bound across the bridge\r\nand into the Rhine; whither, flinging aside his musket, the intrepid\r\nsentry followed him. The Frenchman was the better swimmer of the two,\r\nseized upon the recruiter, and bore him to the Strasburg side of the\r\nstream, where he gave him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You deserve to be shot,\xe2\x80\x99 said the general to him, \xe2\x80\x98for abandoning your\r\npost and arms; but you merit reward for an act of courage and daring.\r\nThe King prefers to reward you,\xe2\x80\x99 and the man received money and\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nAs for Galgenstein, he declared his quality as a nobleman and a captain\r\nin the Prussian service, and applications were made to Berlin to know if\r\nhis representations were true. But the King, though he employed men of\r\nthis stamp (officers to seduce the subjects of his allies) could not\r\nacknowledge his own shame. Letters were written back from Berlin to\r\nsay that such a family existed in the kingdom, but that the person\r\nrepresenting himself to belong to it must be an impostor, for\r\nevery officer of the name was at his regiment and his post. It was\r\nGalgenstein\xe2\x80\x99s death-warrant, and he was hanged as a spy in Strasburg.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Turn him into the cart with the rest,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, as soon as I awoke\r\nfrom my trance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE CRIMP WAGGON--MILITARY EPISODES\r\n\r\nThe covered waggon to which I was ordered to march was standing, as I\r\nhave said, in the courtyard of the farm, with another dismal vehicle\r\nof the same kind hard by it. Each was pretty well filled with a crew of\r\nmen, whom the atrocious crimp who had seized upon me, had enlisted under\r\nthe banners of the glorious Frederick; and I could see by the lanterns\r\nof the sentinels, as they thrust me into the straw, a dozen dark figures\r\nhuddled together in the horrible moving prison where I was now to be\r\nconfined. A scream and a curse from my opposite neighbour showed me that\r\nhe was most likely wounded, as I myself was; and, during the whole of\r\nthe wretched night, the moans and sobs of the poor fellows in similar\r\ncaptivity kept up a continual painful chorus, which effectually\r\nprevented my getting any relief from my ills in sleep. At midnight\r\n(as far as I could judge) the horses were put to the waggons, and the\r\ncreaking lumbering machines were put in motion. A couple of soldiers,\r\nstrongly armed, sat on the outer bench of the cart, and their grim faces\r\npeered in with their lanterns every now and then through the canvas\r\ncurtains, that they might count the number of their prisoners. The\r\nbrutes were half-drunk, and were singing love and war songs, such as \xe2\x80\x98O\r\nGretchen mein Taubchen, mein Herzenstrompet, Mein Kanon, mein Heerpauk\r\nund meine Musket,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Prinz Eugen der edle Ritter.\xe2\x80\x99 and the like; their\r\nwild whoops and jodels making doleful discord with the groans of us\r\ncaptives within the waggons. Many a time afterwards have I heard these\r\nditties sung on the march, or in the barrack-room, or round the fires as\r\nwe lay out at night.\r\n\r\nI was not near so unhappy, in spite of all, as I had been on my first\r\nenlisting in Ireland. At least, thought I, if I am degraded to be a\r\nprivate soldier there will be no one of my acquaintance who will witness\r\nmy shame; and that is the point which I have always cared for most.\r\nThere will be no one to say, \xe2\x80\x98There is young Redmond Barry, the\r\ndescendant or the Barrys, the fashionable young blood of Dublin,\r\npipeclaying his belt and carrying his brown Bess.\xe2\x80\x99 Indeed, but for\r\nthat opinion of the world, with which it is necessary that every man of\r\nspirit should keep upon equal terms, I, for my part, would have always\r\nbeen contented with the humblest portion. Now here, to all intents\r\nand purposes, one was as far removed from the world as in the wilds\r\nof Siberia, or in Robinson Crusoe\xe2\x80\x99s Island. And I reasoned with myself\r\nthus:--\xe2\x80\x98Now you are caught, there is no use in repining: make the best\r\nof your situation, and get all the pleasure you can out of it. There\r\nare a thousand opportunities of plunder, &c., offered to the soldier in\r\nwar-time, out of which he can get both pleasure and profit: make use of\r\nthese, and be happy. Besides, you are extraordinarily brave, handsome,\r\nand clever: and who knows but you may procure advancement in your new\r\nservice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn this philosophical way I looked at my misfortunes, determining not\r\nto be cast down by them; and bore woes and my broken head with perfect\r\nmagnanimity. The latter was, for the moment, an evil against which it\r\nrequired no small powers of endurance to contend; for the jolts of the\r\nwaggon were dreadful, and every shake caused a throb in my brain which I\r\nthought would have split my skull. As the morning dawned, I saw that the\r\nman next me, a gaunt yellow-haired creature, in black, had a cushion of\r\nstraw under his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you wounded, comrade?\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Praised be the Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I am sore hurt in spirit and body,\r\nand bruised in many members; wounded, however, am I not. And you, poor\r\nyouth?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am wounded in the head,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98and I want your pillow: give\r\nit me--I\xe2\x80\x99ve a clasp-knife in my pocket!\xe2\x80\x99 and with this I gave him a\r\nterrible look, meaning to say (and mean it I did, for look you, A LA\r\nGUERRE C\xe2\x80\x99EST A LA GUERRE, and I am none of your milksops) that, unless\r\nhe yielded me the accommodation, I would give him a taste of my steel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would give it thee without any threat, friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nyellow-haired man meekly, and handed me over his little sack of straw.\r\n\r\nHe then leaned himself back as comfortably as he could against the\r\ncart, and began repeating, \xe2\x80\x98Ein\xe2\x80\x99 feste Burg ist unser Gott,\xe2\x80\x99 by which I\r\nconcluded that I had got into the company of a parson. With the jolts of\r\nthe waggon, and accidents of the journey, various more exclamations and\r\nmovements of the passengers showed what a motley company we were. Every\r\nnow and then a countryman would burst into tears; a French voice would\r\nbe heard to say, \xe2\x80\x98O mon Dieu!--mon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x99 a couple more of the same\r\nnation were jabbering oaths and chattering incessantly; and a certain\r\nallusion to his own and everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, which came from a\r\nstalwart figure at the far corner, told me that there was certainly an\r\nEnglishman in our crew.\r\n\r\nBut I was spared soon the tedium and discomforts of the journey. In\r\nspite of the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s cushion, my head, which was throbbing with\r\npain, was brought abruptly in contact with the side of the waggon; it\r\nbegan to bleed afresh: I became almost light-headed. I only recollect\r\nhaving a draught of water here and there; once stopping at a fortified\r\ntown, where an officer counted us:--all the rest of the journey was\r\npassed in a drowsy stupor, from which, when I awoke, I found myself\r\nlying in a hospital bed, with a nun in a white hood watching over me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are in sad spiritual darkness,\xe2\x80\x99 said a voice from the bed next to\r\nme, when the nun had finished her kind offices and retired: \xe2\x80\x98they are\r\nin the night of error, and yet there is the light of faith in those poor\r\ncreatures.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was my comrade of the crimp waggon, his huge broad face looming out\r\nfrom under a white nightcap, and ensconced in the bed beside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! you there, Herr Pastor?\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a candidate, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the white nightcap. \xe2\x80\x98But, praised be\r\nHeaven! you have come to. You have had a wild time of it. You have been\r\ntalking in the English language (with which I am acquainted) of Ireland,\r\nand a young lady, and Mick, and of another young lady, and of a house on\r\nfire, and of the British Grenadiers, concerning whom you sung us parts\r\nof a ballad, and of a number of other matters appertaining, no doubt, to\r\nyour personal history.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has been a very strange one,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98and, perhaps, there is no man\r\nin the world, of my birth, whose misfortunes can at all be compared to\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI do not object to own that I am disposed to brag of my birth and\r\nother acquirements; for I have always found that if a man does not give\r\nhimself a good word, his friends will not do it for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said my fellow-patient, \xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt yours is a strange\r\ntale, and shall be glad to hear it anon; but at present you must not\r\nbe permitted to speak much, for your fever has been long, and your\r\nexhaustion great.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are we?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked; and the candidate informed me that we were in\r\nthe bishopric and town of Fulda, at present occupied by Prince Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntroops. There had been a skirmish with an out-party of French near the\r\ntown, in which a shot entering the waggon, the poor candidate had been\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nAs the reader knows already my history, I will not take the trouble\r\nto repeat it here, or to give the additions with which I favoured\r\nmy comrade in misfortune. But I confess that I told him ours was the\r\ngreatest family and finest palace in Ireland, that we were enormously\r\nwealthy, related to all the peerage descended from the ancient kings,\r\n&c.; and, to my surprise, in the course of our conversation, I found\r\nthat my interlocutor knew a great deal more about Ireland than I did.\r\nWhen, for instance, I spoke of my descent,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From which race of kings?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said I (for my memory for dates was never very accurate), \xe2\x80\x98from\r\nthe old ancient kings of all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! can you trace your origin to the sons Japhet?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith, I can,\xe2\x80\x99 answered I, \xe2\x80\x98and farther too,--Nebuchadnezzar, if you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the candidate, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98that you look upon those legends\r\nwith incredulity. These Partholans and Nemedians, of whom your writers\r\nfondly make mention, cannot be authentically vouched for in history. Nor\r\ndo I believe that we have any more foundation for the tales concerning\r\nthem, than for the legends relative to Joseph of Arimathea and King\r\nBruce which prevailed two centuries back in the sister island.\r\n\r\nAnd then he began a discourse about the Phoenicians, the Scyths or\r\nGoths, the Tuath de Danans, Tacitus, and King MacNeil; which was, to say\r\nthe truth, the very first news I had heard of those personages. As for\r\nEnglish, he spoke it as well as I, and had seven more languages, he\r\nsaid, equally at his command; for, on my quoting the only Latin line\r\nthat I knew, that out of the poet Homer, which says,--\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98As in praesenti perfectum fumat in avi,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nhe began to speak to me in the Roman tongue; on which I was fain to tell\r\nhim that we pronounced it in a different way in Ireland, and so got off\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\nMy honest friend\xe2\x80\x99s history was a curious one, and it may be told here in\r\norder to show of what motley materials our levies were composed:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98a Saxon by birth, my father being pastor of the\r\nvillage of Pfannkuchen, where I imbibed the first rudiments of\r\nknowledge. At sixteen (I am now twenty-three), having mastered the Greek\r\nand Latin tongues, with the French, English, Arabic, and Hebrew; and\r\nhaving come into possession of a legacy of a hundred rixdalers, a sum\r\namply sufficient to defray my University courses, I went to the famous\r\nacademy of Gottingen, where I devoted four years to the exact sciences\r\nand theology. Also, I learned what worldly accomplishments I could\r\ncommand; taking a dancing-tutor at the expense of a groschen a lesson, a\r\ncourse of fencing from a French practitioner, and attending lectures\r\non the great horse and the equestrian science at the hippodrome of a\r\ncelebrated cavalry professor. My opinion is, that a man should know\r\neverything as far as in his power lies: that he should complete his\r\ncycle of experience; and, one science being as necessary as another, it\r\nbehoves him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not of a saving turn, hence my little fortune of a hundred\r\nrixdalers, which has served to keep many a prudent man for a score of\r\nyears, barely sufficed for five years\xe2\x80\x99 studies; after which my studies\r\nwere interrupted, my pupils fell off, and I was obliged to devote much\r\ntime to shoe-binding in order to save money, and, at a future\r\nperiod, resume my academic course. During this period I contracted an\r\nattachment\xe2\x80\x99 (here the candidate sighed a little) \xe2\x80\x98with a person,\r\nwho, though not beautiful, and forty years of age, is yet likely to\r\nsympathise with my existence; and, a month since, my kind friend and\r\npatron, University Prorector Doctor Nasenbrumm, having informed me that\r\nthe Pfarrer of Rumpelwitz was dead, asked whether I would like to have\r\nmy name placed upon the candidate list, and if I were minded to preach a\r\ntrial sermon? As the gaining of this living would further my union with\r\nmy Amalia, I joyously consented, and prepared a discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you like I will recite it to you--No?--Well, I will give you\r\nextracts from it upon our line of march. To proceed, then, with my\r\nbiographical sketch, which is now very near a conclusion; or, as I\r\nshould more correctly say, which has very nearly brought me to the\r\npresent period of time: I preached that sermon at Rumpelwitz, in which I\r\nhope that the Babylonian question was pretty satisfactorily set at\r\nrest. I preached it before the Herr Baron and his noble family, and some\r\nofficers of distinction who were staying at his castle. Mr. Doctor Moser\r\nof Halle followed me in the evening discourse; but, though his exercise\r\nwas learned, and he disposed of a passage of Ignatius, which he proved\r\nto be a manifest interpolation, I do not think his sermon had the effect\r\nwhich mine produced, and that the Rumpelwitzers much relished it. After\r\nthe sermon, all the candidates walked out of church together, and supped\r\nlovingly at the \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Stag\xe2\x80\x9d in Rumpelwitz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98While so occupied, a waiter came in and said that a person without\r\nwished to speak to one of the reverend candidates, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tall one.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\ncould only mean me, for I was a head and shoulders higher than any\r\nother reverend gentleman present. I issued out to see who was the\r\nperson desiring to hold converse with me, and found a man whom I had no\r\ndifficulty in recognising as one of the Jewish persuasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said this Hebrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard from a friend, who was in your\r\nchurch to-day, the heads of the admirable discourse you pronounced\r\nthere. It has affected me deeply, most deeply. There are only one or\r\ntwo points on which I am yet in doubt, and if your honour could but\r\ncondescend to enlighten me on these, I think--I think Solomon Hirsch\r\nwould be a convert to your eloquence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are these points, my good friend?\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and I pointed out to\r\nhim the twenty-four heads of my sermon, asking him in which of these his\r\ndoubts lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We had been walking up and down before the inn while our conversation\r\ntook place, but the windows being open, and my comrades having heard the\r\ndiscourse in the morning, requested me, rather peevishly, not to resume\r\nit at that period. I, therefore, moved on with my disciple, and, at his\r\nrequest, began at once the sermon; for my memory is good for anything,\r\nand I can repeat any book I have read thrice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I poured out, then, under the trees, and in the calm moonlight, that\r\ndiscourse which I had pronounced under the blazing sun of noon. My\r\nIsraelite only interrupted me by exclamations indicative of surprise,\r\nassent, admiration, and increasing conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cProdigious!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe;--\xe2\x80\x9cWunderschon!\xe2\x80\x9d would he remark at the conclusion of some eloquent\r\npassage; in a word, he exhausted the complimentary interjections of our\r\nlanguage: and to compliments what man is averse? I think we must have\r\nwalked two miles when I got to my third head and my companion begged I\r\nwould enter his house, which we now neared, and partake of a glass of\r\nbeer; to which I was never averse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That house, sir, was the inn at which you, too, if I judge aright, were\r\ntaken. No sooner was I in the place, than three crimps rushed upon me,\r\ntold me I was a deserter, and their prisoner, and called upon me to\r\ndeliver up my money and papers; which I did with a solemn protest as\r\nto my sacred character. They consisted of my sermon in MS., Prorector\r\nNasenbrumm\xe2\x80\x99s recommendatory letter, proving my identity, and three\r\ngroschen four pfennigs in bullion. I had already been in the cart twenty\r\nhours when you reached the house. The French officer, who lay opposite\r\nyou (he who screamed when you trod on his foot, for he was wounded),\r\nwas brought in shortly before your arrival. He had been taken with his\r\nepaulets and regimentals, and declared his quality and rank; but he was\r\nalone (I believe it was some affair of love with a Hessian lady which\r\ncaused him to be unattended); and as the persons into whose hands he\r\nfell will make more profit of him as a recruit than as a prisoner, he is\r\nmade to share our fate. He is not the first by many scores so captured.\r\nOne of M. de Soubise\xe2\x80\x99s cooks, and three actors out of a troop in the\r\nFrench camp, several deserters from your English troops (the men are led\r\naway by being told that there is no flogging in the Prussian service),\r\nand three Dutchmen were taken besides.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you,\xe2\x80\x99 said I--\xe2\x80\x98you who were just on the point of getting a valuable\r\nliving,--you who have so much learning, are you not indignant at the\r\noutrage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am a Saxon,\xe2\x80\x99 said the candidate, \xe2\x80\x98and there is no use in indignation.\r\nOur government is crushed under Frederick\xe2\x80\x99s heel these five years, and\r\nI might as well hope for mercy from the Grand Mogul. Nor am I, in truth,\r\ndiscontented with my lot; I have lived on a penny bread for so many\r\nyears, that a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s rations will be a luxury to me. I do not care\r\nabout more or less blows of a cane; all such evils are passing, and\r\ntherefore endurable. I will never, God willing, slay a man in combat;\r\nbut I am not unanxious to experience on myself the effect of the\r\nwar-passion, which has had so great an influence on the human race. It\r\nwas for the same reason that I determined to marry Amalia, for a man is\r\nnot a complete Mensch until he is the father of a family; to be which\r\nis a condition of his existence, and therefore a duty of his education.\r\nAmalia must wait; she is out of the reach of want, being, indeed, cook\r\nto the Frau Prorectorinn Nasenbrumm, my worthy patron\xe2\x80\x99s lady. I have one\r\nor two books with me, which no one is likely to take from me, and one in\r\nmy heart which is the best of all. If it shall please Heaven to finish\r\nmy existence here, before I can prosecute my studies further, what cause\r\nhave I to repine? I pray God I may not be mistaken, but I think I have\r\nwronged no man, and committed no mortal sin. If I have, I know where to\r\nlook for forgiveness; and if I die, as I have said, without knowing all\r\nthat I would desire to learn, shall I not be in a situation to learn\r\nEVERYTHING, and what can human soul ask for more?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me for putting so many _I_\xe2\x80\x98s in my discourse,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ncandidate, \xe2\x80\x98but when a man is talking of himself, \xe2\x80\x98tis the briefest and\r\nsimplest way of talking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn which, perhaps, though I hate egotism, I think my friend was right.\r\nAlthough he acknowledged himself to be a mean-spirited fellow, with no\r\nmore ambition than to know the contents of a few musty books, I think\r\nthe man had some good in him; especially in the resolution with which he\r\nbore his calamities. Many a gallant man of the highest honour is often\r\nnot proof against these, and has been known to despair over a bad\r\ndinner, or to be cast down at a ragged-elbowed coat. MY maxim is to bear\r\nall, to put up with water if you cannot get Burgundy, and if you have no\r\nvelvet to be content with frieze. But Burgundy and velvet are the best,\r\nbien entendu, and the man is a fool who will not seize the best when the\r\nscramble is open.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the sermon which my friend the theologian intended to\r\nimpart to me, were, however, never told; for, after our coming out\r\nof the hospital, he was drafted into a regiment quartered as far as\r\npossible from his native country, in Pomerania; while I was put into\r\nthe Bulow regiment, of which the ordinary headquarters were Berlin. The\r\nPrussian regiments seldom change their garrisons as ours do, for the\r\nfear of desertion is so great, that it becomes necessary to know the\r\nface of every individual in the service; and, in time of peace, men live\r\nand die in the same town. This does not add, as may be imagined, to the\r\namusements of the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s life. It is lest any young gentleman like\r\nmyself should take a fancy to a military career, and fancy that of a\r\nprivate soldier a tolerable one, that I am giving these, I hope, moral\r\ndescriptions of what we poor fellows in the ranks really suffered.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we recovered, we were dismissed from the nuns and the\r\nhospital to the town prison of Fulda, where we were kept like slaves and\r\ncriminals, with artillerymen with lighted matches at the doors of the\r\ncourtyards and the huge black dormitory where some hundreds of us lay;\r\nuntil we were despatched to our different destinations. It was soon seen\r\nby the exercise which were the old soldiers amongst us, and which the\r\nrecruits; and for the former, while we lay in prison, there was a little\r\nmore leisure: though, if possible, a still more strict watch kept than\r\nover the broken-spirited yokels who had been forced or coaxed into the\r\nservice. To describe the characters here assembled would require Mr.\r\nGilray\xe2\x80\x99s own pencil. There were men of all nations and callings. The\r\nEnglishmen boxed and bullied; the Frenchmen played cards, and danced,\r\nand fenced; the heavy Germans smoked their pipes and drank beer, if they\r\ncould manage to purchase it. Those who had anything to risk gambled, and\r\nat this sport I was pretty lucky, for, not having a penny when I entered\r\nthe depot (having been robbed of every farthing of my property by the\r\nrascally crimps), I won near a dollar in my very first game at cards\r\nwith one of the Frenchmen; who did not think of asking whether I could\r\npay or not upon losing. Such, at least, is the advantage of having a\r\ngentlemanlike appearance; it has saved me many a time since by procuring\r\nme credit when my fortunes were at their lowest ebb.\r\n\r\nAmong the Frenchmen there was a splendid man and soldier, whose\r\nreal name we never knew, but whose ultimate history created no small\r\nsensation, when it came to be known in the Prussian army. If beauty and\r\ncourage are proofs of nobility, as (although I have seen some of the\r\nugliest dogs and the greatest cowards in the world in the noblesse) I\r\nhave no doubt courage and beauty are, this Frenchman must have been of\r\nthe highest families in France, so grand and noble was his manner, so\r\nsuperb his person. He was not quite so tall as myself, fair, while I am\r\ndark, and, if possible, rather broader in the shoulders. He was the only\r\nman I ever met who could master me with the small-sword; with which he\r\nwould pink me four times to my three. As for the sabre, I could knock\r\nhim to pieces with it; and I could leap farther and carry more than\r\nhe could. This, however, is mere egotism. This Frenchman, with whom I\r\nbecame pretty intimate--for we were the two cocks, as it were, of the\r\ndepot, and neither had any feeling of low jealousy--was called, for want\r\nof a better name, Le Blondin, on account of his complexion. He was not a\r\ndeserter, but had come in from the Lower Rhine and the bishoprics, as I\r\nfancy; fortune having proved unfavourable to him at play probably, and\r\nother means of existence being denied him. I suspect that the Bastile\r\nwas waiting for him in his own country, had he taken a fancy to return\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nHe was passionately fond of play and liquor, and thus we had a\r\nconsiderable sympathy together: when excited by one or the other, he\r\nbecame frightful. I, for my part, can bear, without wincing, both ill\r\nluck and wine; hence my advantage over him was considerable in our\r\nbouts, and I won enough money from him to make my position tenable. He\r\nhad a wife outside (who, I take it, was the cause of his misfortunes\r\nand separation from his family), and she used to be admitted to see him\r\ntwice or thrice a week, and never came empty-handed---a little brown\r\nbright-eyed creature, whose ogles had made the greatest impression upon\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\nThis man was drafted into a regiment that was quartered at Neiss in\r\nSilesia, which is only at a short distance from the Austrian frontier;\r\nhe maintained always the same character for daring and skill, and was,\r\nin the secret republic of the regiment--which always exists as well\r\nas the regular military hierarchy--the acknowledged leader. He was\r\nan admirable soldier, as I have said; but haughty, dissolute, and a\r\ndrunkard. A man of this mark, unless he takes care to coax and flatter\r\nhis officers (which I always did), is sure to fall out with them. Le\r\nBlondin\xe2\x80\x99s captain was his sworn enemy, and his punishments were frequent\r\nand severe.\r\n\r\nHis wife and the women of the regiment (this was after the peace) used\r\nto carry on a little commerce of smuggling across the Austrian frontier,\r\nwhere their dealings were winked at by both parties; and in obedience\r\nto the instructions of her husband, this woman, from every one of her\r\nexcursions, would bring in a little powder and ball: commodities which\r\nare not to be procured by the Prussian soldier, and which were stowed\r\naway in secret till wanted. They WERE to be wanted, and that soon.\r\n\r\nLe Blondin had organised a great and extraordinary conspiracy. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how far it went, how many hundreds or thousands it embraced; but\r\nstrange were the stories told about the plot amongst us privates: for\r\nthe news was spread from garrison to garrison, and talked of by the\r\narmy, in spite of all the Government efforts to hush it up--hush it\r\nup, indeed! I have been of the people myself; I have seen the Irish\r\nrebellion, and I know what is the free-masonry of the poor.\r\n\r\nHe made himself the head of the plot. There were no writings nor papers.\r\nNo single one of the conspirators communicated with any other than\r\nthe Frenchman; but personally he gave his orders to them all. He had\r\narranged matters for a general rising of the garrison, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\non a certain day: the guard-houses in the town were to be seized, the\r\nsentinels cut down, and--who knows the rest? Some of our people used\r\nto say that the conspiracy was spread through all Silesia, and that Le\r\nBlondin was to be made a general in the Austrian service.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and opposite the guard-house by the Bohmer-Thor of\r\nNeiss, some thirty men were lounging about in their undress, and the\r\nFrenchman stood near the sentinel of the guard-house, sharpening a wood\r\nhatchet on a stone. At the stroke of twelve, he got up, split open the\r\nsentinel\xe2\x80\x99s head with a blow of his axe, and the thirty men, rushing into\r\nthe guard-house, took possession of the arms there, and marched at once\r\nto the gate. The sentry there tried to drop the bar, but the Frenchman\r\nrushed up to him, and, with another blow of the axe, cut off his right\r\nhand, with which he held the chain. Seeing the men rushing out armed,\r\nthe guard without the gate drew up across the road to prevent their\r\npassage; but the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s thirty gave them a volley, charged them\r\nwith the bayonet, and brought down several, and the rest flying, the\r\nthirty rushed on. The frontier is only a league from Neiss, and they\r\nmade rapidly towards it.\r\n\r\nBut the alarm was given in the town, and what saved it was that the\r\nclock by which the Frenchman went was a quarter of an hour faster than\r\nany of the clocks in the town. The generale was beat, the troops\r\ncalled to arms, and thus the men who were to have attacked the other\r\nguard-houses, were obliged to fall into the ranks, and their project\r\nwas defeated. This, however, likewise rendered the discovery of the\r\nconspirators impossible, for no man could betray his comrade, nor, of\r\ncourse, would he criminate himself.\r\n\r\nCavalry was sent in pursuit of the Frenchman and his thirty fugitives,\r\nwho were, by this time, far on their way to the Bohemian frontier. When\r\nthe horse came up with them, they turned, received them with a volley\r\nand the bayonet, and drove them back. The Austrians were out at the\r\nbarriers, looking eagerly on at the conflict. The women, who were on the\r\nlook-out too, brought more ammunition to these intrepid deserters, and\r\nthey engaged and drove back the dragoons several times. But in these\r\ngallant and fruitless combats much time was lost, and a battalion\r\npresently came up, and surrounded the brave thirty; when the fate of the\r\npoor fellows was decided. They fought with the fury of despair: not one\r\nof them asked for quarter. When their ammunition failed, they fought\r\nwith the steel, and were shot down or bayoneted where they stood. The\r\nFrenchman was the very last man who was hit. He received a bullet in the\r\nthigh, and fell, and in this state was overpowered, killing the officer\r\nwho first advanced to seize him.\r\n\r\nHe and the very few of his comrades who survived were carried back\r\nto Neiss, and immediately, as the ringleader, he was brought before a\r\ncouncil of war. He refused all interrogations which were made as to his\r\nreal name and family. \xe2\x80\x98What matters who I am?\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98you have me and\r\nwill shoot me. My name would not save me were it ever so famous.\xe2\x80\x99 In the\r\nsame way he declined to make a single discovery regarding the plot. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwas all my doing,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98each man engaged in it only knew me, and is\r\nignorant of every one of his comrades. The secret is mine alone, and\r\nthe secret shall die with me.\xe2\x80\x99 When the officers asked him what was the\r\nreason which induced him to meditate a crime so horrible?--\xe2\x80\x98It was\r\nyour infernal brutality and tyranny,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You are all butchers,\r\nruffians, tigers, and you owe it to the cowardice of your men that you\r\nwere not murdered long ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this his captain burst into the most furious exclamations against the\r\nwounded man, and rushing up to him, struck him a blow with his fist. But\r\nLe Blondin, wounded as he was, as quick as thought seized the bayonet of\r\none of the soldiers who supported him, and plunged it into the officer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreast. \xe2\x80\x98Scoundrel and monster,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I shall have the consolation\r\nof sending you out of the world before I die.\xe2\x80\x99 He was shot that day.\r\nHe offered to write to the King, if the officers would agree to let his\r\nletter go sealed into the hands of the postmaster; but they feared, no\r\ndoubt, that something might be said to inculpate themselves, and refused\r\nhim the permission. At the next review Frederick treated them, it is\r\nsaid, with great severity, and rebuked them for not having granted the\r\nFrenchman his request. However, it was the King\xe2\x80\x99s interest to conceal\r\nthe matter, and so it was, as I have said before, hushed up--so well\r\nhushed up, that a hundred thousand soldiers in the army knew it; and\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x99s the one of us that has drunk to the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s memory over our\r\nwine, as a martyr for the cause of the soldier. I shall have,\r\ndoubtless, some readers who will cry out at this, that I am encouraging\r\ninsubordination and advocating murder. If these men had served as\r\nprivates in the Prussian army from 1760 to 1765, they would not be\r\nso apt to take objection. This man destroyed two sentinels to get his\r\nliberty; how many hundreds of thousands of his own and the Austrian\r\npeople did King Frederick kill because he took a fancy to Silesia? It\r\nwas the accursed tyranny of the system that sharpened the axe which\r\nbrained the two sentinels of Neiss: and so let officers take warning,\r\nand think twice ere they visit poor fellows with the cane.\r\n\r\nI could tell many more stories about the army; but as, from having been\r\na soldier myself, all my sympathies are in the ranks, no doubt my\r\ntales would be pronounced to be of an immoral tendency, and I had best,\r\ntherefore, be brief. Fancy my surprise while in this depot, when one day\r\na well-known voice saluted my ear, and I heard a meagre young gentleman,\r\nwho was brought in by a couple of troopers and received a few cuts\r\nacross the shoulders from one of them, say in the best English, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\ninfernal WASCAL, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be wevenged for this. I\xe2\x80\x99ll WITE to my ambassador,\r\nas sure as my name\xe2\x80\x99s Fakenham of Fakenham.\xe2\x80\x99 I burst out laughing at\r\nthis: it was my old acquaintance in MY corporal\xe2\x80\x99s coat. Lischen had\r\nsworn stoutly, that he was really and truly the private, and the poor\r\nfellow had been drafted off, and was to be made one of us. But I bear no\r\nmalice, and having made the whole room roar with the story of the way\r\nin which I had tricked the poor lad, I gave him a piece of advice, which\r\nprocured him his liberty. \xe2\x80\x98Go to the inspecting officer,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nthey once get you into Prussia it is all over with you, and they will\r\nnever give you up. Go now to the commandant of the depot, promise him\r\na hundred--five hundred guineas to set you free; say that the crimping\r\ncaptain has your papers and portfolio\xe2\x80\x99 (this was true); \xe2\x80\x98above all, show\r\nhim that you have the means of paying him the promised money, and I will\r\nwarrant you are set free.\xe2\x80\x99 He did as I advised, and when we were put on\r\nthe march Mr. Fakenham found means to be allowed to go into hospital,\r\nand while in hospital the matter was arranged as I had recommended.\r\nHe had nearly, however, missed his freedom by his own stinginess in\r\nbargaining for it, and never showed the least gratitude towards me his\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\nI am not going to give any romantic narrative of the Seven Years\xe2\x80\x99 War.\r\nAt the close of it, the Prussian army, so renowned for its disciplined\r\nvalour, was officered and under-officered by native Prussians, it is\r\ntrue; but was composed for the most part of men hired or stolen, like\r\nmyself, from almost every nation in Europe. The deserting to and fro\r\nwas prodigious. In my regiment (Bulow\xe2\x80\x99s) alone before the war, there had\r\nbeen no less than 600 Frenchmen, and as they marched out of Berlin\r\nfor the campaign, one of the fellows had an old fiddle on which he\r\nwas flaying a French tune, and his comrades danced almost, rather than\r\nwalked, after him, singing, \xe2\x80\x98Nous allons en France.\xe2\x80\x99 Two years after,\r\nwhen they returned to Berlin, there were only six of these men left; the\r\nrest had fled or were killed in action. The life the private soldier led\r\nwas a frightful one to any but men of iron courage and endurance. There\r\nwas a corporal to every three men, marching behind them, and pitilessly\r\nusing the cane; so much so that it used to be said that in action\r\nthere was a front rank of privates and a second rank of sergeants\r\nand corporals to drive them on. Many men would give way to the most\r\nfrightful acts of despair under these incessant persecutions and\r\ntortures; and amongst several regiments of the army a horrible practice\r\nhad sprung up, which for some time caused the greatest alarm to the\r\nGovernment. This was a strange frightful custom of CHILD-MURDER. The men\r\nused to say that life was unbearable, that suicide was a crime; in\r\norder to avert which, and to finish with the intolerable misery of their\r\nposition, the best plan was to kill a young child, which was innocent,\r\nand therefore secure of heaven, and then to deliver themselves up as\r\nguilty of the murder. The King himself--the hero, sage, and philosopher,\r\nthe prince who had always liberality on his lips and who affected a\r\nhorror of capital punishments--was frightened at this dreadful protest,\r\non the part of the wretches whom he had kidnapped, against his monstrous\r\ntyranny; but his only means of remedying the evil was strictly to forbid\r\nthat such criminals should be attended by any ecclesiastic whatever, and\r\ndenied all religious consolation.\r\n\r\nThe punishment was incessant. Every officer had the liberty to inflict\r\nit, and in peace it was more cruel than in war. For when peace came\r\nthe King turned adrift such of his officers as were not noble; whatever\r\ntheir services might have been. He would call a captain to the front of\r\nhis company and say, \xe2\x80\x98He is not noble, let him go.\xe2\x80\x99 We were afraid of\r\nhim somehow, and were cowed before him like wild beasts before their\r\nkeeper. I have seen the bravest men of the army cry like children at a\r\ncut of the cane; I have seen a little ensign of fifteen call out a man\r\nof fifty from the ranks, a man who had been in a hundred battles, and\r\nhe has stood presenting arms, and sobbing and howling like a baby, while\r\nthe young wretch lashed him over the arms and thighs with the stick.\r\nIn a day of action this man would dare anything. A button might be awry\r\nTHEN and nobody touched him; but when they had made the brute fight,\r\nthen they lashed him again into subordination. Almost all of us yielded\r\nto the spell--scarce one could break it. The French officer I have\r\nspoken of as taken along with me, was in my company, and caned like\r\na dog. I met him at Versailles twenty years afterwards, and he turned\r\nquite pale and sick when I spoke to him of old days. \xe2\x80\x98For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of that time: I wake up from my sleep trembling and\r\ncrying even now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs for me, after a very brief time (in which it must be confessed\r\nI tasted, like my comrades, of the cane) and after I had found\r\nopportunities to show myself to be a brave and dexterous soldier, I\r\ntook the means I had adopted in the English army to prevent any further\r\npersonal degradation. I wore a bullet around my neck, which I did not\r\ntake the pains to conceal, and I gave out that it should be for the man\r\nor officer who caused me to be chastised. And there was something in\r\nmy character which made my superiors believe me; for that bullet had\r\nalready served me to kill an Austrian colonel, and I would have given\r\nit to a Prussian with as little remorse. For what cared I for their\r\nquarrels, or whether the eagle under which I marched had one head or\r\ntwo? All I said was, \xe2\x80\x98No man shall find me tripping in my duty; but no\r\nman shall ever lay a hand upon me.\xe2\x80\x99 And by this maxim I abided as long\r\nas I remained in the service.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to make a history of battles in the Prussian any more\r\nthan in the English service. I did my duty in them as well as another,\r\nand by the time that my moustache had grown to a decent length, which\r\nit did when I was twenty years of age, there was not a braver, cleverer,\r\nhandsomer, and I must own, wickeder soldier in the Prussian army. I had\r\nformed myself to the condition of the proper fighting beast; on a day of\r\naction I was savage and happy; out of the field I took all the pleasure\r\nI could get, and was by no means delicate as to its quality or the\r\nmanner of procuring it. The truth is, however, that there was among our\r\nmen a much higher tone of society than among the clumsy louts in the\r\nEnglish army, and our service was generally so strict that we had little\r\ntime for doing mischief. I am very dark and swarthy in complexion,\r\nand was called by our fellows the \xe2\x80\x98Black Englander,\xe2\x80\x99 the \xe2\x80\x98Schwartzer\r\nEnglander,\xe2\x80\x99 or the English Devil. If any service was to be done, I was\r\nsure to be put upon it. I got frequent gratifications of money, but no\r\npromotion; and it was on the day after I had killed the Austrian colonel\r\n(a great officer of Uhlans, whom I engaged--singly and on foot) that\r\nGeneral Bulow, my colonel, gave me two Frederics-d\xe2\x80\x99or in front of the\r\nregiment, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I reward thee now; but I fear I shall have to hang\r\nthee one day or other.\xe2\x80\x99 I spent the money, and that I had taken from the\r\ncolonel\xe2\x80\x99s body, every groschen, that night with some jovial companions;\r\nbut as long as war lasted was never without a dollar in my purse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. BARRY LEADS A GARRISON LIFE, AND FINDS MANY FRIENDS THERE\r\n\r\nAfter the war our regiment was garrisoned in the capital, the least\r\ndull, perhaps, of all the towns of Prussia: but that does not say much\r\nfor its gaiety. Our service, which was always severe, still left many\r\nhours of the day disengaged, in which we might take our pleasure had we\r\nthe means of paying for the same. Many of our mess got leave to work\r\nin trades; but I had been brought up to none: and besides, my honour\r\nforbade me; for as a gentleman, I could not soil my fingers by a manual\r\noccupation. But our pay was barely enough to keep us from starving; and\r\nas I have always been fond of pleasure, and as the position in which we\r\nnow were, in the midst of the capital, prevented us from resorting to\r\nthose means of levying contributions which are always pretty feasible in\r\nwartime, I was obliged to adopt the only means left me of providing\r\nfor my expenses: and in a word became the ORDONNANZ, or confidential\r\nmilitary gentleman, of my captain. I spurned the office four years\r\npreviously, when it was made to me in the English service; but the\r\nposition is very different in a foreign country; besides, to tell the\r\ntruth, after five years in the ranks, a man\xe2\x80\x99s pride will submit to many\r\nrebuffs which would be intolerable to him in an independent condition.\r\n\r\nThe captain was a young man and had distinguished himself during the\r\nwar, or he would never have been advanced to rank so early. He was,\r\nmoreover, the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Monsieur de\r\nPotzdorff, a relationship which no doubt aided in the young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npromotion. Captain de Potzdorff was a severe officer enough on parade or\r\nin barracks, but he was a person easily led by flattery. I won his heart\r\nin the first place by my manner of tying my hair in queue (indeed,\r\nit was more neatly dressed than that of any man in the regiment),\r\nand subsequently gained his confidence by a thousand little arts and\r\ncompliments, which as a gentleman myself I knew how to employ. He was a\r\nman of pleasure, which he pursued more openly than most men in the stern\r\nCourt of the King; he was generous and careless with his purse, and he\r\nhad a great affection for Rhine wine: in all which qualities I sincerely\r\nsympathised with him; and from which I, of course, had my profit. He was\r\ndisliked in the regiment, because he was supposed to have too intimate\r\nrelations with his uncle the Police Minister; to whom, it was hinted, he\r\ncarried the news of the corps.\r\n\r\nBefore long I had ingratiated myself considerably with my officer,\r\nand knew most of his affairs. Thus I was relieved from many drills and\r\nparades, which would otherwise have fallen to my lot, and came in for a\r\nnumber of perquisites; which enabled me to support a genteel figure and\r\nto appear with some ECLAT in a certain, though it must be confessed very\r\nhumble, society in Berlin. Among the ladies I was always an especial\r\nfavourite, and so polished was my behaviour amongst them, that they\r\ncould not understand how I should have obtained my frightful nickname of\r\nthe Black Devil in the regiment. \xe2\x80\x98He is not so black as he is painted,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI laughingly would say; and most of the ladies agreed that the private\r\nwas quite as well-bred as the captain: as indeed how should it be\r\notherwise, considering my education and birth?\r\n\r\nWhen I was sufficiently ingratiated with him, I asked leave to address a\r\nletter to my poor mother in Ireland, to whom I had not given any news of\r\nmyself for many many years; for the letters of the foreign soldiers were\r\nnever admitted to the post, for fear of appeals or disturbances on the\r\npart of their parents abroad. My captain agreed to find means to forward\r\nthe letter, and as I knew that he would open it, I took care to give it\r\nhim unsealed; thus showing my confidence in him. But the letter was, as\r\nyou may imagine, written so that the writer should come to no harm were\r\nit intercepted. I begged my honoured mother\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness for having\r\nfled from her; I said that my extravagance and folly in my own country\r\nI knew rendered my return thither impossible; but that she would, at\r\nleast, be glad to know that I was well and happy in the service of the\r\ngreatest monarch in the world, and that the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s life was most\r\nagreeable to me: and, I added, that I had found a kind protector and\r\npatron, who I hoped would some day provide for me as I knew it was out\r\nof her power to do. I offered remembrances to all the girls at Castle\r\nBrady, naming them from Biddy to Becky downwards, and signed myself,\r\nas in truth I was, her affectionate son, Redmond Barry, in Captain\r\nPotzdorffs company of the Bulowisch regiment of foot in garrison at\r\nBerlin. Also I told her a pleasant story about the King kicking the\r\nChancellor and three judges downstairs, as he had done one day when I\r\nwas on guard at Potsdam, and said I hoped for another war soon, when I\r\nmight rise to be an officer. In fact, you might have imagined my letter\r\nto be that of the happiest fellow in the world, and I was not on this\r\nhead at all sorry to mislead my kind parent.\r\n\r\nI was sure my letter was read, for Captain Potzdorff began asking me\r\nsome days afterwards about my family, and I told him the circumstances\r\npretty truly, all things considered. I was a cadet of a good family, but\r\nmy mother was almost ruined and had barely enough to support her eight\r\ndaughters, whom I named. I had been to study for the law at Dublin,\r\nwhere I had got into debt and bad company, had killed a man in a\r\nduel, and would be hanged or imprisoned by his powerful friends, if I\r\nreturned. I had enlisted in the English service, where an opportunity\r\nfor escape presented itself to me such as I could not resist; and\r\nhereupon I told the story of Mr. Fakenham of Fakenham in such a way as\r\nmade my patron to be convulsed with laughter, and he told me afterwards\r\nthat he had repeated the story at Madame de Kamake\xe2\x80\x99s evening assembly,\r\nwhere all the world was anxious to have a sight of the young Englander.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was the British Ambassador there?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, in a tone of the greatest\r\nalarm, and added, \xe2\x80\x98For Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, sir, do not tell my name to him,\r\nor he might ask to have me delivered up: and I have no fancy to go to\r\nbe hanged in my dear native country.\xe2\x80\x99 Potzdorff, laughing, said he would\r\ntake care that I should remain where I was, on which I swore eternal\r\ngratitude to him.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, and with rather a grave face, he said to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Redmond, I have been talking to our colonel about you, and as I\r\nwondered that a fellow of your courage and talents had not been advanced\r\nduring the war, the general said they had had their eye upon you: that\r\nyou were a gallant soldier, and had evidently come of a good stock; that\r\nno man in the regiment had had less fault found with him; but that no\r\nman merited promotion less. You were idle, dissolute, and unprincipled;\r\nyou had done a deal of harm to the men; and, for all your talents and\r\nbravery, he was sure would come to no good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, quite astonished that any mortal man should have formed\r\nsuch an opinion of me, \xe2\x80\x98I hope General Bulow is mistaken regarding my\r\ncharacter. I have fallen into bad company, it is true; but I have only\r\ndone as other soldiers have done; and, above all, I have never had a\r\nkind friend and protector before, to whom I might show that I was worthy\r\nof better things. The general may say I am a ruined lad, and send me to\r\nthe d---l: but be sure of this, I would go to the d---l to serve YOU.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThis speech I saw pleased my patron very much; and, as I was very\r\ndiscreet and useful in a thousand delicate ways to him, he soon came to\r\nhave a sincere attachment for me. One day, or rather night, when he\r\nwas tete-a-tete with the lady of the Tabaks Rath von Dose for instance,\r\nI--But there is no use in telling affairs which concern nobody now.\r\n\r\nFour months after my letter to my mother, I got, under cover to the\r\nCaptain, a reply, which created in my mind a yearning after home, and\r\na melancholy which I cannot describe. I had not seen the dear soul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting for five years. All the old days, and the fresh happy sunshine\r\nof the old green fields in Ireland, and her love, and my uncle, and Phil\r\nPurcell, and everything that I had done and thought, came back to me\r\nas I read the letter; and when I was alone I cried over it, as I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndone since the day when Nora jilted me. I took care not to show my\r\nfeelings to the regiment or my captain: but that night, when I was\r\nto have taken tea at the Garden-house outside Brandenburg Gate, with\r\nFraulein Lottchen (the Tabaks Rathinn\xe2\x80\x99s gentlewoman of company), I\r\nsomehow had not the courage to go; but begged to be excused, and went\r\nearly to bed in barracks, out of which I went and came now almost as I\r\nwilled, and passed a long night weeping and thinking about dear Ireland.\r\n\r\nNext day, my spirits rose again and I got a ten-guinea bill cashed,\r\nwhich my mother sent in the letter, and gave a handsome treat to some of\r\nmy acquaintance. The poor soul\xe2\x80\x99s letter was blotted all over with tears,\r\nfull of texts, and written in the wildest incoherent way. She said\r\nshe was delighted to think I was under a Protestant prince, though she\r\nfeared he was not in the right way: that right way, she said, she had\r\nthe blessing to find, under the guidance of the Reverend Joshua Jowls,\r\nwhom she sat under. She said he was a precious chosen vessel; a sweet\r\nointment and precious box of spikenard; and made use of a great number\r\nmore phrases that I could not understand; but one thing was clear in the\r\nmidst of all this jargon, that the good soul loved her son still, and\r\nthought and prayed day and night for her wild Redmond. Has it not come\r\nacross many a poor fellow, in a solitary night\xe2\x80\x99s watch, or in sorrow,\r\nsickness, or captivity, that at that very minute, most likely, his\r\nmother is praying for him? I often have had these thoughts; but they are\r\nnone of the gayest, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite as well that they don\xe2\x80\x99t come to you\r\nin company; for where would be a set of jolly fellows then?--as mute as\r\nundertakers at a funeral, I promise you. I drank my mother\xe2\x80\x99s health that\r\nnight in a bumper, and lived like a gentleman whilst the money lasted.\r\nShe pinched herself to give it me, as she told me afterwards; and Mr.\r\nJowls was very wroth with her. Although the good soul\xe2\x80\x99s money was very\r\nquickly spent, I was not long in getting more; for I had a hundred ways\r\nof getting it, and became a universal favourite with the Captain and\r\nhis friends. Now, it was Madame von Dose who gave me a Frederic-d\xe2\x80\x99or for\r\nbringing her a bouquet or a letter from the Captain; now it was, on\r\nthe contrary, the old Privy Councillor who treated me with a bottle of\r\nRhenish, and slipped into my hand a dollar or two, in order that I might\r\ngive him some information regarding the liaison between my captain and\r\nhis lady. But though I was not such a fool as not to take his money, you\r\nmay be sure I was not dishonourable enough to betray my benefactor; and\r\nhe got very little out of ME. When the Captain and the lady fell out,\r\nand he began to pay his addresses to the rich daughter of the Dutch\r\nMinister, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many more letters and guineas the unfortunate\r\nTabaks Rathinn handed over to me, that I might get her lover back again.\r\nBut such returns are rare in love, and the Captain used only to laugh at\r\nher stale sighs and entreaties. In the house of Mynheer Van Guldensack\r\nI made myself so pleasant to high and low, that I came to be quite\r\nintimate there: and got the knowledge of a state secret or two, which\r\nsurprised and pleased my captain very much. These little hints he\r\ncarried to his uncle, the Minister of Police, who, no doubt, made\r\nhis advantage of them; and thus I began to be received quite in a\r\nconfidential light by the Potzdorff family, and became a mere nominal\r\nsoldier, being allowed to appear in plain clothes (which were, I warrant\r\nyou, of a neat fashion), and to enjoy myself in a hundred ways, which\r\nthe poor fellows my comrades envied. As for the sergeants, they were as\r\ncivil to me as to an officer: it was as much as their stripes were worth\r\nto offend a person who had the ear of the Minister\xe2\x80\x99s nephew. There was\r\nin my company a young fellow by the name of Kurz, who was six feet high\r\nin spite of his name, and whose life I had saved in some affair of\r\nthe war. What does this lad do, after I had recounted to him one of my\r\nadventures, but call me a spy and informer, and beg me not to call\r\nhim DU any more, as is the fashion with young men when they are very\r\nintimate. I had nothing for it but to call him out; but I owed him no\r\ngrudge. I disarmed him in a twinkling; and as I sent his sword flying\r\nover his head, said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Kurz, did ever you know a man guilty of\r\na mean action who can do as I do now?\xe2\x80\x99 This silenced the rest of the\r\ngrumblers; and no man ever sneered at me after that.\r\n\r\nNo man can suppose that to a person of my fashion the waiting in\r\nantechambers, the conversation of footmen and hangers-on, was pleasant.\r\nBut it was not more degrading than the barrack-room, of which I need not\r\nsay I was heartily sick. My protestations of liking for the army were\r\nall intended to throw dust into the eyes of my employer. I sighed to be\r\nout of slavery. I knew I was born to make a figure in the world. Had I\r\nbeen one of the Neiss garrison, I would have cut my way to freedom\r\nby the side of the gallant Frenchman; but here I had only artifice to\r\nenable me to attain my end, and was not I justified in employing it? My\r\nplan was this: I may make myself so necessary to M. de Potzdorff, that\r\nhe will obtain my freedom. Once free, with my fine person and good\r\nfamily, I will do what ten thousand Irish gentlemen have done before,\r\nand will marry a lady of fortune and condition. And the proof that I\r\nwas, if not disinterested, at least actuated by a noble ambition, is\r\nthis. There was a fat grocer\xe2\x80\x99s widow in Berlin with six hundred thalers\r\nof rent, and a good business, who gave me to understand that she would\r\npurchase my discharge if I would marry her; but I frankly told her that\r\nI was not made to be a grocer, and thus absolutely flung away a chance\r\nof freedom which she offered me.\r\n\r\nAnd I was grateful to my employers; more grateful than they to me. The\r\nCaptain was in debt, and had dealings with the Jews, to whom he gave\r\nnotes of hand payable on his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s death. The old Herr von Potzdorff,\r\nseeing the confidence his nephew had in me, offered to bribe me to know\r\nwhat the young man\xe2\x80\x99s affairs really were. But what did I do? I informed\r\nMonsieur George von Potzdorff of the fact; and we made out, in concert,\r\na list of little debts, so moderate, that they actually appeased the old\r\nuncle instead of irritating, and he paid them, being glad to get off so\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nAnd a pretty return I got for this fidelity. One morning, the old\r\ngentleman being closeted with his nephew (he used to come to get any\r\nnews stirring as to what the young officers of the regiment were doing:\r\nwhether this or that gambled; who intrigued, and with whom; who was at\r\nthe ridotto on such a night; who was in debt, and what not; for the King\r\nliked to know the business of every officer in his army), I was\r\nsent with a letter to the Marquis d\xe2\x80\x99Argens (that afterwards married\r\nMademoiselle Cochois the actress), and, meeting the Marquis at a few\r\npaces off in the street, gave my message, and returned to the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodging. He and his worthy uncle were making my unworthy self the\r\nsubject of conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is noble,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bah!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the uncle (whom I could have throttled for his\r\ninsolence). \xe2\x80\x98All the beggarly Irish who ever enlisted tell the same\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was kidnapped by Galgenstein,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A kidnapped deserter,\xe2\x80\x99 said M. Potzdorff; \xe2\x80\x98la belle affaire!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I promised the lad I would ask for his discharge; and I am sure\r\nyou can make him useful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You HAVE asked his discharge,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the elder, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98Bon Dieu!\r\nYou are a model of probity! You\xe2\x80\x99ll never succeed to my place, George, if\r\nyou are no wiser than you are just now. Make the fellow as useful to you\r\nas you please. He has a good manner and a frank countenance. He can lie\r\nwith an assurance that I never saw surpassed, and fight, you say, on a\r\npinch. The scoundrel does not want for good qualities; but he is vain, a\r\nspendthrift, and a bavard. As long as you have the regiment in terrorem\r\nover him, you can do as you like with him. Once let him loose, and the\r\nlad is likely to give you the slip. Keep on promising him; promise to\r\nmake him a general, if you like. What the deuce do I care? There are\r\nspies enough to be had in this town without him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the services I rendered to M. Potzdorff were qualified\r\nby that ungrateful old gentleman; and I stole away from the room\r\nextremely troubled in spirit, to think that another of my fond dreams\r\nwas thus dispelled; and that my hopes of getting out of the army,\r\nby being useful to the Captain, were entirely vain. For some time\r\nmy despair was such, that I thought of marrying the widow; but the\r\nmarriages of privates are never allowed without the direct permission\r\nof the King; and it was a matter of very great doubt whether His Majesty\r\nwould allow a young fellow of twenty-two, the handsomest man of his\r\narmy, to be coupled to a pimplefaced old widow of sixty, who was\r\nquite beyond the age when her marriage would be likely to multiply the\r\nsubjects of His Majesty. This hope of liberty was therefore vain; nor\r\ncould I hope to purchase my discharge, unless any charitable soul would\r\nlend me a large sum of money; for, though I made a good deal, as I\r\nhave said, yet I have always had through life an incorrigible knack of\r\nspending, and (such is my generosity of disposition) have been in debt\r\never since I was born.\r\n\r\nMy captain, the sly rascal! gave me a very different version of his\r\nconversation with his uncle to that which I knew to be the true one; and\r\nsaid smilingly to me, \xe2\x80\x98Redmond, I have spoken to the Minister regarding\r\nthy services,[Footnote: The service about which Mr. Barry here speaks\r\nhas, and we suspect purposely, been described by him in very dubious\r\nterms. It is most probable that he was employed to wait at the table\r\nof strangers in Berlin, and to bring to the Police Minister any news\r\nconcerning them which might at all interest the Government. The great\r\nFrederick never received a guest without taking these hospitable\r\nprecautions; and as for the duels which Mr. Barry fights, may we be\r\nallowed to hint a doubt as to a great number of these combats. It will\r\nbe observed, in one or two other parts of his Memoirs, that whenever he\r\nis at an awkward pass, or does what the world does not usually consider\r\nrespectable, a duel, in which he is victorious, is sure to ensue; from\r\nwhich he argues that he is a man of undoubted honour.] and thy fortune\r\nis made. We shall get thee out of the army, appoint thee to the police\r\nbureau, and procure for thee an inspectorship of customs; and, in fine,\r\nallow thee to move in a better sphere than that in which Fortune has\r\nhitherto placed thee.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not believe a word of this speech, I affected to be very\r\nmuch moved by it, and of course swore eternal gratitude to the Captain\r\nfor his kindness to the poor Irish castaway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your service at the Dutch Minister\xe2\x80\x99s has pleased me very well. There is\r\nanother occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; and if you\r\nsucceed, depend on it your reward will be secure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the service, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98I will do anything for so kind a\r\nmaster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is lately come to Berlin,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x98a gentleman in\r\nthe service of the Empress-Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de\r\nBalibari, and wears the red riband and star of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s order of the\r\nSpur. He speaks Italian or French indifferently; but we have some\r\nreason to fancy this Monsieur de Balibari is a native of your country of\r\nIreland. Did you ever hear such a name as Balibari in Ireland?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Balibari? Balyb--?\xe2\x80\x99 A sudden thought flashed across me. \xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x98I never heard the name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must go into his service. Of course you will not know a word of\r\nEnglish: and if the Chevalier asks as to the particularity of your\r\naccent, say you are a Hungarian. The servant who came with him will be\r\nturned away to-day, and the person to whom he has applied for a faithful\r\nfellow will recommend you. You are a Hungarian; you served in the Seven\r\nYears\xe2\x80\x99 War. You left the army on account of weakness of the loins. You\r\nserved Monsieur de Quellenberg two years; he is now with the army in\r\nSilesia, but there is your certificate signed by him. You afterwards\r\nlived with Doctor Mopsius, who will give you a character, if need be;\r\nand the landlord of the \xe2\x80\x9cStar\xe2\x80\x9d will, of course, certify that you are an\r\nhonest fellow: but his certificate goes for nothing. As for the rest of\r\nyour story, you can fashion that as you will, and make it as romantic\r\nor as ludicrous as your fancy dictates. Try, however, to win the\r\nChevalier\xe2\x80\x99s confidence by provoking his compassion. He gambles a great\r\ndeal, and WINS. Do you know the cards well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a very little, as soldiers do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had thought you more expert. You must find out if the Chevalier\r\ncheats; if he does, we have him. He sees the English and Austrian envoys\r\ncontinually, and the young men of either Ministry sup repeatedly at his\r\nhouse. Find out what they talk of; for how much each plays, especially\r\nif any of them play on parole: if you can read his private letters, of\r\ncourse you will; though about those which go to the post, you need not\r\ntrouble yourself; we look at them there. But never see him write a note\r\nwithout finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.\r\nHe sleeps with the keys of his despatch-box on a string round his neck.\r\nTwenty Frederics, if you get an impression of the keys. You will, of\r\ncourse, go in plain clothes. You had best brush the powder out of your\r\nhair, and tie it with a riband simply; your moustache you must of course\r\nshave off.\r\n\r\nWith these instructions, and a very small gratuity, the Captain left me.\r\nWhen I again saw him, he was amused at the change in my appearance.\r\nI had, not without a pang (for they were as black as jet, and curled\r\nelegantly), shaved off my moustaches; had removed the odious grease and\r\nflour, which I always abominated, out of my hair; had mounted a demure\r\nFrench grey coat, black satin breeches, and a maroon plush waistcoat,\r\nand a hat without a cockade. I looked as meek and humble as any servant\r\nout of place could possibly appear; and I think not my own regiment,\r\nwhich was now at the review at Potsdam, would have known me. Thus\r\naccoutred, I went to the \xe2\x80\x98Star Hotel,\xe2\x80\x99 where this stranger was,--my\r\nheart beating with anxiety, and something telling me that this Chevalier\r\nde Balibari was no other than Barry, of Ballybarry, my father\xe2\x80\x99s eldest\r\nbrother, who had given up his estate in consequence of his obstinate\r\nadherence to the Romish superstition. Before I went in to present\r\nmyself, I went to look in the remises at his carriage. Had he the Barry\r\narms? Yes, there they were: argent, a bend gules, with four escallops of\r\nthe field,--the ancient coat of my house. They were painted in a shield\r\nabout as big as my hat, on a smart chariot handsomely gilded, surmounted\r\nwith a coronet, and supported by eight or nine Cupids, cornucopias, and\r\nflower-baskets, according to the queer heraldic fashion of those days.\r\nIt must be he! I felt quite feint as I went up the stairs. I was going\r\nto present myself before my uncle in the character of a servant!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are the young man whom M. de Seebach recommended?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI bowed, and handed him a letter from that gentleman, with which my\r\ncaptain had taken care to provide me. As he looked at it I had leisure\r\nto examine him. My uncle was a man of sixty years of age, dressed\r\nsuperbly in a coat and breeches of apricot-coloured velvet, a white\r\nsatin waistcoat embroidered with gold like the coat. Across his breast\r\nwent the purple riband of his order of the Spur; and the star of the\r\norder, an enormous one, sparkled on his breast. He had rings on all his\r\nfingers, a couple of watches in his fobs, a rich diamond solitaire in\r\nthe black riband round his neck, and fastened to the bag of his wig; his\r\nruffles and frills were decorated with a profusion of the richest lace.\r\nHe had pink silk stockings rolled over the knee, and tied with gold\r\ngarters; and enormous diamond buckles to his red-heeled shoes. A sword\r\nmounted in gold, in a white fish-skin scabbard; and a hat richly laced,\r\nand lined with white feathers, which were lying on a table beside him,\r\ncompleted the costume of this splendid gentleman. In height he was\r\nabout my size, that is, six feet and half an inch; his cast of features\r\nsingularly like mine, and extremely distingue. One of his eyes was\r\nclosed with a black patch, however; he wore a little white and red\r\npaint, by no means an unusual ornament in those days; and a pair of\r\nmoustaches, which fell over his lip and hid a mouth that I afterwards\r\nfound had rather a disagreeable expression. When his beard was removed,\r\nthe upper teeth appeared to project very much; and his countenance wore\r\na ghastly fixed smile, by no means pleasant.\r\n\r\nIt was very imprudent of me; but when I saw the splendour of his\r\nappearance, the nobleness of his manner, I felt it impossible to keep\r\ndisguise with him; and when he said, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, you are a Hungarian, I see!\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ncould hold no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I am an Irishman, and my name is Redmond Barry, of\r\nBallybarry.\xe2\x80\x99 As I spoke, I burst into tears; I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell why; but I had\r\nseen none of my kith or kin for six years, and my heart longed for some\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. BARRY\xe2\x80\x99S ADIEU TO MILITARY PROFESSION\r\n\r\nYou who have never been out of your country, know little what it is to\r\nhear a friendly voice in captivity; and there\xe2\x80\x99s many a man that will not\r\nunderstand the cause of the burst of feeling which I have confessed took\r\nplace on my seeing my uncle. He never for a minute thought to question\r\nthe truth of what I said. \xe2\x80\x98Mother of God!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s my brother\r\nHarry\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x99 And I think in my heart he was as much affected as I was\r\nat thus suddenly finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile\r\nfrom home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to\r\nhis memory again, and the old days of his boyhood. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d give five years\r\nof my life to see them again,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, after caressing me very warmly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 asked I. \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 replied he, \xe2\x80\x98the green fields, and the river,\r\nand the old round tower, and the burying-place at Ballybarry. \xe2\x80\x98Twas a\r\nshame for your father to part with the land, Redmond, that went so long\r\nwith the name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe then began to ask me concerning myself, and I gave him my history at\r\nsome length; at which the worthy gentleman laughed many times, saying,\r\nthat I was a Barry all over. In the middle of my story he would stop\r\nme, to make me stand back to back, and measure with him (by which I\r\nascertained that our heights were the same, and that my uncle had\r\na stiff knee, moreover, which made him walk in a peculiar way), and\r\nuttered, during the course of the narrative, a hundred exclamations of\r\npity, and kindness, and sympathy. It was \xe2\x80\x98Holy Saints!\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Mother of\r\nHeaven!\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Blessed Mary!\xe2\x80\x99 continually; by which, and with justice, I\r\nconcluded that he was still devotedly attached to the ancient faith of\r\nour family.\r\n\r\nIt was with some difficulty that I came to explain to him the last part\r\nof my history, viz., that I was put into his service as a watch upon his\r\nactions, of which I was to give information in a certain quarter. When\r\nI told him (with a great deal of hesitation) of this fact, he burst out\r\nlaughing, and enjoyed the joke amazingly. \xe2\x80\x98The rascals!\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98they\r\nthink to catch me, do they? Why, Redmond, my chief conspiracy is a\r\nfaro-bank. But the King is so jealous, that he will see a spy in every\r\nperson who comes to his miserable capital in the great sandy desert\r\nhere. Ah, my boy, I must show you Paris and Vienna!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI said there was nothing I longed for more than to see any city but\r\nBerlin, and should be delighted to be free of the odious military\r\nservice. Indeed, I thought, from his splendour of appearance, the\r\nknickknacks about the room, the gilded carriage in the remise, that my\r\nuncle was a man of vast property; and that he would purchase a dozen,\r\nnay, a whole regiment of substitutes, in order to restore me to freedom.\r\n\r\nBut I was mistaken in my calculations regarding him, as his history of\r\nhimself speedily showed me. \xe2\x80\x98I have been beaten about the world,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98ever since the year 1742, when my brother your father (and Heaven\r\nforgive him) cut my family estate from under my heels, by turning\r\nheretic, in order to marry that scold of a mother of yours. Well, let\r\nbygones be bygones. \xe2\x80\x98Tis probable that I should have run through the\r\nlittle property as he did in my place, and I should have had to begin\r\na year or two later the life I have been leading ever since I was\r\ncompelled to leave Ireland. My lad, I have been in every service;\r\nand, between ourselves, owe money in every capital in Europe. I made a\r\ncampaign or two with the Pandours under Austrian Trenck. I was captain\r\nin the Guard of His Holiness the Pope, I made the campaign of Scotland\r\nwith the Prince of Wales--a bad fellow, my dear, caring more for\r\nhis mistress and his brandy-bottle than for the crowns of the three\r\nkingdoms. I have served in Spain and in Piedmont; but I have been a\r\nrolling stone, my good fellow. Play--play has been my ruin; that and\r\nbeauty\xe2\x80\x99 (here he gave a leer which made him, I must confess, look\r\nanything but handsome; besides, his rouged cheeks were all beslobbered\r\nwith the tears which he had shed on receiving me). \xe2\x80\x98The women have made\r\na fool of me, my dear Redmond. I am a soft-hearted creature, and this\r\nminute, at sixty-two, have no more command of myself than when Peggy\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Dwyer made a fool of me at sixteen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98I think it runs in the family!\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ndescribed to him, much to his amusement, my romantic passion for my\r\ncousin, Nora Brady. He resumed his narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The cards now are my only livelihood. Sometimes I am in luck, and then\r\nI lay out my money in these trinkets you see. It\xe2\x80\x99s property, look you,\r\nRedmond; and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me.\r\nWhen the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the\r\npawnbrokers, and I wear paste. Friend Moses the goldsmith will pay me a\r\nvisit this very day; for the chances have been against me all the week\r\npast, and I must raise money for the bank to-night. Do you understand\r\nthe cards?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI replied that I could play as soldiers do, but had no great skill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will practise in the morning, my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put you up\r\nto a thing or two worth knowing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOf course I was glad to have such an opportunity of acquiring knowledge,\r\nand professed myself delighted to receive my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s instruction.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s account of himself rather disagreeably affected me.\r\nAll his show was on his back, as he said. His carriage, with the fine\r\ngilding, was a part of his stock in trade. He HAD a sort of mission from\r\nthe Austrian Court:--it was to discover whether a certain quantity of\r\nalloyed ducats which had been traced to Berlin, were from the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntreasury. But the real end of Monsieur de Balibari was play. There was\r\na young attache of the English embassy, my Lord Deuceace, afterwards\r\nViscount and Earl of Crabs in the English peerage, who was playing high;\r\nand it was after hearing of the passion of this young English nobleman\r\nthat my uncle, then at Prague, determined to visit Berlin and engage\r\nhim. For there is a sort of chivalry among the knights of the dice-box:\r\nthe fame of great players is known all over Europe. I have known the\r\nChevalier de Casanova, for instance, to travel six hundred miles, from\r\nParis to Turin, for the purpose of meeting Mr. Charles Fox, then only my\r\nLord Holland\xe2\x80\x99s dashing son, afterwards the greatest of European orators\r\nand statesmen.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that I should keep my character of valet; that in the\r\npresence of strangers I should not know a word of English; that I should\r\nkeep a good look-out on the trumps when I was serving the champagne and\r\npunch about; and, having a remarkably fine eyesight and a great natural\r\naptitude, I was speedily able to give my dear uncle much assistance\r\nagainst his opponents at the green table. Some prudish persons may\r\naffect indignation at the frankness of these confessions, but Heaven\r\npity them! Do you suppose that any man who has lost or won a hundred\r\nthousand pounds at play will not take the advantages which his neighbour\r\nenjoys? They are all the same. But it is only the clumsy fool who\r\nCHEATS; who resorts to the vulgar expedients of cogged dice and cut\r\ncards. Such a man is sure to go wrong some time or other, and is not fit\r\nto play in the society of gallant gentlemen; and my advice to people who\r\nsee such a vulgar person at his pranks is, of course, to back him\r\nwhile he plays, but never--never to have anything to do with him. Play\r\ngrandly, honourably. Be not, of course, cast down at losing; but above\r\nall, be not eager at winning, as mean souls are. And, indeed, with all\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s skill and advantages, winning is often problematical; I have seen\r\na sheer ignoramus that knows no more of play than of Hebrew, blunder you\r\nout of five thousand pounds in a few turns of the cards. I have seen a\r\ngentleman and his confederate play against another and HIS confederate.\r\nOne never is secure in these cases: and when one considers the time and\r\nlabour spent, the genius, the anxiety, the outlay of money required, the\r\nmultiplicity of bad debts that one meets with (for dishonourable rascals\r\nare to be found at the play-table, as everywhere else in the world),\r\nI say, for my part, the profession is a bad one; and, indeed, have\r\nscarcely ever met a man who, in the end, profited by it. I am writing\r\nnow with the experience of a man of the world. At the time I speak of I\r\nwas a lad, dazzled by the idea of wealth, and respecting, certainly too\r\nmuch, my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s superior age and station in life.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to particularise here the little arrangements made\r\nbetween us; the playmen of the present day want no instruction, I take\r\nit, and the public have little interest in the matter. But simplicity\r\nwas our secret. Everything successful is simple. If, for instance, I\r\nwiped the dust off a chair with my napkin, it was to show that the enemy\r\nwas strong in diamonds; if I pushed it, he had ace, king; if I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Punch or wine, my Lord?\xe2\x80\x99 hearts was meant; if \xe2\x80\x98Wine or punch?\xe2\x80\x99 clubs.\r\nIf I blew my nose, it was to indicate that there was another confederate\r\nemployed by the adversary; and THEN, I warrant you, some pretty trials\r\nof skill would take place. My Lord Deuceace, although so young, had a\r\nvery great skill and cleverness with the cards in every way; and it was\r\nonly from hearing Frank Punter, who came with him, yawn three times when\r\nthe Chevalier had the ace of trumps, that I knew we were Greek to Greek,\r\nas it were.\r\n\r\nMy assumed dulness was perfect; and I used to make Monsieur de\r\nPotzdorff laugh with it, when I carried my little reports to him at\r\nthe Garden-house outside the town where he gave me rendezvous. These\r\nreports, of course, were arranged between me and my uncle beforehand. I\r\nwas instructed (and it is always far the best way) to tell as much truth\r\nas my story would possibly bear. When, for instance, he would ask me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does the Chevalier do of a morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He goes to church regularly\xe2\x80\x99 (he was very religious), \xe2\x80\x98and after\r\nhearing mass comes home to breakfast. Then he takes an airing in his\r\nchariot till dinner, which is served at noon. After dinner he writes his\r\nletters, if he have any letters to write: but he has very little to\r\ndo in this way. His letters are to the Austrian envoy, with whom he\r\ncorresponds, but who does not acknowledge him; and being written in\r\nEnglish, of course I look over his shoulder. He generally writes for\r\nmoney. He says he wants it to bribe the secretaries of the Treasury,\r\nin order to find out really where the alloyed ducats come from; but,\r\nin fact, he wants it to play of evenings, when he makes his party with\r\nCalsabigi, the lottery-contractor, the Russian attaches, two from the\r\nEnglish embassy, my Lords Deuceace and Punter, who play a jeu d\xe2\x80\x99enfer,\r\nand a few more. The same set meet every night at supper: there are\r\nseldom any ladies; those who come are chiefly French ladies, members of\r\nthe corps de ballet. He wins often, but not always. Lord Deuceace is a\r\nvery fine player. The Chevalier Elliot, the English Minister, sometimes\r\ncomes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play. Monsieur de\r\nBalibari dines at the missions, but en petit comite, not on grand days\r\nof reception. Calsabigi, I think, is his confederate at play. He has\r\nwon lately; but the week before last he pledged his solitaire for four\r\nhundred ducats.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do he and the English attaches talk together in their own language?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he and the envoy spoke yesterday for half-an-hour about the new\r\ndanseuse and the American troubles: chiefly about the new danseuse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the information I gave was very minute and\r\naccurate, though not very important. But such as it was, it was carried\r\nto the ears of that famous hero and warrior the Philosopher of Sans\r\nSouci; and there was not a stranger who entered the capital but his\r\nactions were similarly spied and related to Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nAs long as the play was confined to the young men of the different\r\nembassies, His Majesty did not care to prevent it; nay, he encouraged\r\nplay at all the missions, knowing full well that a man in difficulties\r\ncan be made to speak, and that a timely rouleau of Frederics would\r\noften get him a secret worth many thousands. He got some papers from\r\nthe French house in this way: and I have no doubt that my Lord Deuceace\r\nwould have supplied him with information at a similar rate, had his\r\nchief not known the young nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s character pretty well, and had\r\n(as is usually the case) the work of the mission performed by a steady\r\nroturier, while the young brilliant bloods of the suite sported their\r\nembroidery at the balls, or shook their Mechlin ruffles over the green\r\ntables at faro. I have seen many scores of these young sprigs since,\r\nof these and their principals, and, mon Dieu! what fools they are! What\r\ndullards, what fribbles, what addle-headed simple coxcombs! This is one\r\nof the lies of the world, this diplomacy; or how could we suppose, that\r\nwere the profession as difficult as the solemn red-box and tape-men\r\nwould have us believe, they would invariably choose for it little\r\npink-faced boys from school, with no other claim than mamma\xe2\x80\x99s title, and\r\nable at most to judge of a curricle, a new dance, or a neat boot?\r\n\r\nWhen it became known, however, to the officers of the garrison that\r\nthere was a faro-table in town, they were wild to be admitted to the\r\nsport; and, in spite of my entreaties to the contrary, my uncle was\r\nnot averse to allow the young gentlemen their fling, and once or twice\r\ncleared a handsome sum out of their purses. It was in vain I told him\r\nthat I must carry the news to my captain, before whom his comrades would\r\nnot fail to talk, and who would thus know of the intrigue even without\r\nmy information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell him,\xe2\x80\x99 said my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They will send you away,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98then what is to become of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Make your mind easy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the latter, with a smile; \xe2\x80\x98you shall not be\r\nleft behind, I warrant you. Go take a last look at your barracks, make\r\nyour mind easy; say a farewell to your friends in Berlin. The dear\r\nsouls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country;\r\nand, as sure as my name is Barry, out of it you shall go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Recollect Mr. Fakenham of Fakenham,\xe2\x80\x99 said he knowingly. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis you\r\nyourself taught me how. Go get me one of my wigs. Open my despatch-box\r\nyonder, where the great secrets of the Austrian Chancery lie; put your\r\nhair back off you forehead; clap me on this patch and these moustaches,\r\nand now look in the glass!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Chevalier de Balibari,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, bursting with laughter, and began\r\nwalking the room in his manner with his stiff knee.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when I went to make my report to Monsieur de Potzdorff, I\r\ntold him of the young Prussian officers that had been of late gambling;\r\nand he replied, as I expected, that the King had determined to send the\r\nChevalier out of the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a stingy curmudgeon,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied; \xe2\x80\x98I have had but three Frederics\r\nfrom him in two months, and I hope you will remember your promise to\r\nadvance me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, three Frederics were too much for the news you have picked up,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Captain, sneering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not my fault that there has been no more,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied. \xe2\x80\x98When is he\r\nto go, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The day after to-morrow. You say he drives after breakfast and before\r\ndinner. When he comes out to his carriage, a couple of gendarmes will\r\nmount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And his baggage, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! that will be sent after him. I have a fancy to look into that red\r\nbox which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall\r\nbe at the inn. You will not say a word to any one there regarding the\r\naffair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s rooms until my arrival.\r\nWe must force that box. You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got\r\nthe key long ago!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI begged the Captain to remember me, and so took my leave of him. The\r\nnext night I placed a couple of pistols under the carriage seat; and\r\nI think the adventures of the following day are quite worthy of the\r\nhonours of a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. I APPEAR IN A MANNER BECOMING MY NAME AND LINEAGE\r\n\r\nFortune smiling at parting upon Monsieur de Balibari, enabled him to win\r\na handsome sum with his faro-bank.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, the carriage of the Chevalier de\r\nBalibari drew up as usual at the door of his hotel; and the Chevalier,\r\nwho was at his window, seeing the chariot arrive, came down the stairs\r\nin his usual stately manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is my rascal Ambrose?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, looking around and not finding\r\nhis servant to open the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will let down the steps for your honour,\xe2\x80\x99 said a gendarme, who was\r\nstanding by the carriage; and no sooner had the Chevalier entered,\r\nthan the officer jumped in after him, another mounted the box by the\r\ncoachman, and the latter began to drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good gracious!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Chevalier, \xe2\x80\x98what is this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are going to drive to the frontier,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gendarme, touching\r\nhis hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is shameful--infamous! I insist upon being put down at the Austrian\r\nAmbassador\xe2\x80\x99s house!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have orders to gag your honour if you cry out,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gendarme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All Europe shall hear of this!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Chevalier, in a fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you please,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the officer, and then both relapsed into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe silence was not broken between Berlin and Potsdam, through which\r\nplace the Chevalier passed as His Majesty was reviewing his guards\r\nthere, and the regiments of Bulow, Zitwitz, and Henkel de Donnersmark.\r\nAs the Chevalier passed His Majesty, the King raised his hat and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Qu\xe2\x80\x99il ne descende pas: je lui souhaite un bon voyage.\xe2\x80\x99 The Chevalier de\r\nBalibari acknowledged this courtesy by a profound bow.\r\n\r\nThey had not got far beyond Potsdam, when boom! the alarm cannon began\r\nto roar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a deserter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Chevalier, and sank back into his carriage\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHearing the sound of the guns, the common people came out along the road\r\nwith fowling-pieces and pitchforks, in hopes to catch the truant. The\r\ngendarmes seemed very anxious to be on the look-out for him too. The\r\nprice of a deserter was fifty crowns to those who brought him in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confess, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Chevalier to the police officer in the carriage\r\nwith him, \xe2\x80\x98that you long to be rid of me, from whom you can get nothing,\r\nand to be on the look-out for the deserter who may bring you in fifty\r\ncrowns? Why not tell the postilion to push on? You may land me at the\r\nfrontier and get back to your hunt all the sooner.\xe2\x80\x99 The officer told\r\nthe postillion to get on; but the way seemed intolerably long to\r\nthe Chevalier. Once or twice he thought he heard the noise of horse\r\ngalloping behind: his own horses did not seem to go two miles an hour;\r\nbut they DID go. The black and white barriers came in view at last, hard\r\nby Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony. The Saxon\r\ncustom-house officers came out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no luggage,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Chevalier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gentleman has nothing contraband,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Prussian officers,\r\ngrinning, and took their leave of their prisoner with much respect.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Balibari gave them a Frederic apiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I wish you a good day. Will you please to go to\r\nthe house whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send\r\non my baggage to the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Kings\xe2\x80\x9d at Dresden?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for\r\nthat capital. I need not tell you that _I_ was the Chevalier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From the Chevalier de Balibari to Redmond Barry, Esquire, Gentilhomme\r\nAnglais, a l\xe2\x80\x99Hotel des 3 Couronnes, a Dresde en Saxe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nephew Redmond,--This comes to you by a sure hand, no other than Mr.\r\nLumpit of the English Mission, who is acquainted, as all Berlin will\r\nbe directly, with our wonderful story. They only know half as yet;\r\nthey only know that a deserter went off in my clothes, and all are in\r\nadmiration of your cleverness and valour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I confess that for two hours after your departure I lay in bed in no\r\nsmall trepidation, thinking whether His Majesty might have a fancy to\r\nsend me to Spandau, for the freak of which we had both been guilty. But\r\nin that case I had taken my precautions: I had written a statement of\r\nthe case to my chief, the Austrian Minister, with the full and true\r\nstory how you had been set to spy upon me, how you turned out to be\r\nmy very near relative, how you had been kidnapped yourself into the\r\nservice, and how we both had determined to effect your escape. The laugh\r\nwould have been so much against the King, that he never would have dared\r\nto lay a finger upon me. What would Monsieur de Voltaire have said\r\nto such an act of tyranny? But it was a lucky day, and everything has\r\nturned out to my wish. As I lay in my bed two and a half hours after\r\nyour departure, in comes your ex-Captain Potzdorff. \xe2\x80\x9cRedmont!\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\nin his imperious High-Dutch way, \xe2\x80\x9care you there?\xe2\x80\x9d No answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rogue\r\nis gone out,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and straightway makes for my red box where I keep\r\nmy love-letters, my glass eye which I used to wear, my favourite lucky\r\ndice with which I threw the thirteen mains at Prague; my two sets of\r\nParis teeth, and my other private matters that you know of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He first tried a bunch of keys, but none of them would fit the little\r\nEnglish lock. Then my gentleman takes out of his pocket a chisel and\r\nhammer, and falls to work like a professional burglar, actually bursting\r\nopen my little box!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now was my time to act. I advance towards him armed with an immense\r\nwater-jug. I come noiselessly up to him just as he had broken the box,\r\nand with all my might I deal him such a blow over the head as smashes\r\nthe water-jug to atoms, and sends my captain with a snort lifeless to\r\nthe ground. I thought I had killed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I ring all the bells in the house; and shout and swear and\r\nscream, \xe2\x80\x9cThieves!--thieves!--landlord!--murder!--fire!\xe2\x80\x9d until the whole\r\nhousehold come tumbling up the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my servant?\xe2\x80\x9d roar I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho dares to rob me in open day? Look at the villain whom I find in\r\nthe act of breaking my chest open! Send for the police, send for his\r\nExcellency the Austrian Minister! all Europe shall know of this insult!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDear Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d says the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cwe saw you go away three hours ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cME!\xe2\x80\x9d says I; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, man, I have been in bed all the morning. I am\r\nill--I have taken physic--I have not left the house this morning! Where\r\nis that scoundrel Ambrose? But, stop! where are my clothes and wig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n for I was standing before them in my chamber-gown and stockings, with my\r\nnightcap on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI have it--I have it!\xe2\x80\x9d says a little chambermaid: \xe2\x80\x9cAmbrose is off in\r\nyour honour\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my money--my money!\xe2\x80\x9d says I; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is my purse with forty-eight\r\nFrederics in it? But we have one of the villains left. Officers, seize\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the young Herr von Potzdorff!\xe2\x80\x9d says the landlord, more and more\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! a gentleman breaking open my trunk with hammer and\r\nchisel--impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Herr von Potzdorff was returning to life by this time, with a swelling\r\non his skull as big as a saucepan; and the officers carried him off, and\r\nthe judge who was sent for dressed a proces verbal of the matter, and I\r\ndemanded a copy of it, which I sent forthwith to my ambassador.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was kept a prisoner to my room the next day, and a judge, a general,\r\nand a host of lawyers, officers, and officials, were set upon me to\r\nbully, perplex, threaten, and cajole me. I said it was true you had told\r\nme that you had been kidnapped into the service, that I thought you were\r\nreleased from it, and that I had you with the best recommendations. I\r\nappealed to my Minister, who was bound to come to my aid; and, to make\r\na long story short, poor Potzdorff is now on his way to Spandau; and his\r\nuncle, the elder Potzdorff, has brought me five hundred louis, with a\r\nhumble request that I would leave Berlin forthwith, and hush up this\r\npainful matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be with you at the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Crowns\xe2\x80\x9d the day after you receive\r\nthis. Ask Mr. Lumpit to dinner. Do not spare your money--you are my son.\r\nEverybody in Dresden knows your loving uncle,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THE CHEVALIER DE BALIBARI.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd by these wonderful circumstances I was once more free again: and I\r\nkept my resolution then made, never to fall more into the hands of any\r\nrecruiter, and henceforth and for ever to be a gentleman.\r\n\r\nWith this sum of money, and a good run of luck which ensued presently,\r\nwe were enabled to make no ungenteel figure. My uncle speedily joined\r\nme at the inn at Dresden, where, under pretence of illness, I had\r\nkept quiet until his arrival; and, as the Chevalier de Balibari was in\r\nparticular good odour at the Court of Dresden (having been an intimate\r\nacquaintance of the late monarch, the Elector, King of Poland, the most\r\ndissolute and agreeable of European princes), I was speedily in the very\r\nbest society of the Saxon capital: where I may say that my own person\r\nand manners, and the singularity of the adventures in which I had been a\r\nhero, made me especially welcome. There was not a party of the nobility\r\nto which the two gentlemen of Balibari were not invited. I had the\r\nhonour of kissing hands and being graciously received at Court by the\r\nElector, and I wrote home to my mother such a flaming description of my\r\nprosperity, that the good soul very nearly forgot her celestial welfare\r\nand her confessor, the Reverend Joshua Jowls, in order to come after me\r\nto Germany; but travelling was very difficult in those days, and so we\r\nwere spared the arrival of the good lady.\r\n\r\nI think the soul of Harry Barry, my father, who was always so genteel\r\nin his turn of mind, must have rejoiced to see the position which I now\r\noccupied; all the women anxious to receive me, all the men in a fury;\r\nhobnobbing with dukes and counts at supper, dancing minuets with\r\nhigh-well-born baronesses (as they absurdly call themselves in Germany),\r\nwith lovely excellencies, nay, with highnesses and transparencies\r\nthemselves: who could compete with the gallant young Irish noble? who\r\nwould suppose that seven weeks before I had been a common--bah! I am\r\nashamed to think of it! One of the pleasantest moments of my life was at\r\na grand gala at the Electoral Palace, where I had the honour of walking\r\na polonaise with no other than the Margravine of Bayreuth, old Fritz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown sister: old Fritz\xe2\x80\x99s, whose hateful blue-baize livery I had worn,\r\nwhose belts I had pipeclayed, and whose abominable rations of small beer\r\nand sauerkraut I had swallowed for five years.\r\n\r\nHaving won an English chariot from an Italian gentleman at play, my\r\nuncle had our arms painted on the panels in a more splendid way than\r\never, surmounted (as we were descended from the ancient kings) with an\r\nIrish crown of the most splendid size and gilding. I had this crown in\r\nlieu of a coronet engraved on a large amethyst signet-ring worn on my\r\nforefinger; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind confessing that I used to say the jewel had\r\nbeen in my family for several thousand years, having originally belonged\r\nto my direct ancestor, his late Majesty King Brian Boru, or Barry. I\r\nwarrant the legends of the Heralds\xe2\x80\x99 College are not more authentic than\r\nmine was.\r\n\r\nAt first the Minister and the gentlemen at the English hotel used to be\r\nrather shy of us two Irish noblemen, and questioned our pretensions to\r\nrank. The Minister was a lord\xe2\x80\x99s son, it is true, but he was likewise a\r\ngrocer\xe2\x80\x99s grandson; and so I told him at Count Lobkowitz\xe2\x80\x99s masquerade.\r\nMy uncle, like a noble gentleman as he was, knew the pedigree of\r\nevery considerable family in Europe. He said it was the only knowledge\r\nbefitting a gentleman; and when we were not at cards, we would pass\r\nhours over Gwillim or D\xe2\x80\x99Hozier, reading the genealogies, learning the\r\nblazons, and making ourselves acquainted with the relationships of\r\nour class. Alas! the noble science is going into disrepute now: so are\r\ncards, without which studies and pastimes I can hardly conceive how a\r\nman of honour can exist.\r\n\r\nMy first affair of honour with a man of undoubted fashion was on the\r\nscore of my nobility, with young Sir Rumford Bumford of the English\r\nembassy; my uncle at the same time sending a cartel to the Minister, who\r\ndeclined to come. I shot Sir Rumford in the leg, amidst the tears of joy\r\nof my uncle, who accompanied me to the ground; and I promise you that\r\nnone of the young gentlemen questioned the authenticity of my pedigree,\r\nor laughed at my Irish crown again.\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful life did we now lead! I knew I was born a gentleman,\r\nfrom the kindly way in which I took to the business: as business\r\nit certainly is. For though it SEEMS all pleasure, yet I assure any\r\nlow-bred persons who may chance to read this, that we, their betters,\r\nhave to work as well as they: though I did not rise until noon, yet had\r\nI not been up at play until long past midnight? Many a time have we come\r\nhome to bed as the troops were marching out to early parade; and oh!\r\nit did my heart good to hear the bugles blowing the reveille before\r\ndaybreak, or to see the regiments marching out to exercise, and think\r\nthat I was no longer bound to that disgusting discipline, but restored\r\nto my natural station.\r\n\r\nI came into it at once, and as if I had never done anything else all my\r\nlife. I had a gentleman to wait upon me, a French friseur to dress my\r\nhair of a morning; I knew the taste of chocolate as by intuition almost,\r\nand could distinguish between the right Spanish and the French before\r\nI had been a week in my new position; I had rings on all my fingers,\r\nwatches in both my fobs, canes, trinkets, and snuffboxes of all sorts,\r\nand each outvying the other in elegance. I had the finest natural taste\r\nfor lace and china of any man I ever knew; I could judge a horse as well\r\nas any Jew dealer in Germany; in shooting and athletic exercises I\r\nwas unrivalled; I could not spell, but I could speak German and French\r\ncleverly. I had at the least twelve suits of clothes; three richly\r\nembroidered with gold, two laced with silver, a garnet-coloured velvet\r\npelisse lined with sable; one of French grey, silver-laced, and lined\r\nwith chinchilla. I had damask morning robes. I took lessons on the\r\nguitar, and sang French catches exquisitely. Where, in fact, was there a\r\nmore accomplished gentleman than Redmond de Balibari?\r\n\r\nAll the luxuries becoming my station could not, of course, be purchased\r\nwithout credit and money: to procure which, as our patrimony had been\r\nwasted by our ancestors, and we were above the vulgarity and slow\r\nreturns and doubtful chances of trade, my uncle kept a faro-bank. We\r\nwere in partnership with a Florentine, well known in all the Courts\r\nof Europe, the Count Alessandro Pippi, as skilful a player as ever was\r\nseen; but he turned out a sad knave latterly, and I have discovered that\r\nhis countship was a mere imposture. My uncle was maimed, as I have said;\r\nPippi, like all impostors, was a coward; it was my unrivalled skill with\r\nthe sword, and readiness to use it, that maintained the reputation of\r\nthe firm, so to speak, and silenced many a timid gambler who might have\r\nhesitated to pay his losings. We always played on parole with anybody:\r\nany person, that is, of honour and noble lineage. We never pressed for\r\nour winnings or declined to receive promissory notes in lieu of gold.\r\nBut woe to the man who did not pay when the note became due! Redmond\r\nde Balibari was sure to wait upon him with his bill, and I promise you\r\nthere were very few bad debts: on the contrary, gentlemen were\r\ngrateful to us for our forbearance, and our character for honour stood\r\nunimpeached. In later times, a vulgar national prejudice has chosen\r\nto cast a slur upon the character of men of honour engaged in the\r\nprofession of play; but I speak of the good old days in Europe, before\r\nthe cowardice of the French aristocracy (in the shameful Revolution,\r\nwhich served them right) brought discredit and ruin upon our order. They\r\ncry fie now upon men engaged in play; but I should like to know how much\r\nmore honourable THEIR modes of livelihood are than ours. The broker of\r\nthe Exchange who bulls and bears, and buys and sells, and dabbles with\r\nlying loans, and trades on State secrets, what is he but a gamester? The\r\nmerchant who deals in teas and tallow, is he any better? His bales of\r\ndirty indigo are his dice, his cards come up every year instead of every\r\nten minutes, and the sea is his green table. You call the profession of\r\nthe law an honourable one, where a man will lie for any bidder; lie down\r\npoverty for the sake of a fee from wealth, lie down right because wrong\r\nis in his brief. You call a doctor an honourable man, a swindling quack,\r\nwho does not believe in the nostrums which he prescribes, and takes your\r\nguinea for whispering in your ear that it is a fine morning; and\r\nyet, forsooth, a gallant man who sits him down before the baize and\r\nchallenges all comers, his money against theirs, his fortune against\r\ntheirs, is proscribed by your modern moral world. It is a conspiracy\r\nof the middle classes against gentlemen: it is only the shopkeeper cant\r\nwhich is to go down nowadays. I say that play was an institution of\r\nchivalry: it has been wrecked, along with other privileges of men of\r\nbirth. When Seingalt engaged a man for six-and-thirty hours without\r\nleaving the table, do you think he showed no courage? How have we had\r\nthe best blood, and the brightest eyes, too, of Europe throbbing round\r\nthe table, as I and my uncle have held the cards and the bank against\r\nsome terrible player, who was matching some thousands out of his\r\nmillions against our all which was there on the baize! when we engaged\r\nthat daring Alexis Kossloffsky, and won seven thousand louis in a single\r\ncoup, had we lost, we should have been beggars the next day; when HE\r\nlost, he was only a village and a few hundred serfs in pawn the worse.\r\nWhen, at Toeplitz, the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lacqueys, each\r\nwith four bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against\r\nthe sealed bags, what did we ask? \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said we, \xe2\x80\x98we have but eighty\r\nthousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months. If\r\nyour Highness\xe2\x80\x99s bags do not contain more than eighty thousand, we will\r\nmeet you.\xe2\x80\x99 And we did, and after eleven hours\xe2\x80\x99 play, in which our\r\nbank was at one time reduced to two hundred and three ducats, we won\r\nseventeen thousand florins of him. Is THIS not something like boldness?\r\ndoes THIS profession not require skill, and perseverance, and bravery?\r\nFour crowned heads looked on at the game, and an Imperial princess, when\r\nI turned up the ace of hearts and made Paroli, burst into tears. No\r\nman on the European Continent held a higher position than Redmond Barry\r\nthen; and when the Duke of Courland lost, he was pleased to say that we\r\nhad won nobly; and so we had, and spent nobly what we won.\r\n\r\nAt this period my uncle, who attended mass every day regularly, always\r\nput ten florins into the box. Wherever we went, the tavern-keepers made\r\nus more welcome than royal princes. We used to give away the broken meat\r\nfrom our suppers and dinners to scores of beggars who blessed us. Every\r\nman who held my horse or cleaned my boots got a ducat for his pains.\r\nI was, I may say, the author of our common good fortune, by putting\r\nboldness into our play. Pippi was a faint-hearted fellow, who was always\r\ncowardly when he began to win. My uncle (I speak with great respect of\r\nhim) was too much of a devotee, and too much of a martinet at play ever\r\nto win GREATLY. His moral courage was unquestionable, but his daring was\r\nnot sufficient. Both of these my seniors very soon acknowledged me to be\r\ntheir chief, and hence the style of splendour I have described.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned H.I.H. the Princess Frederica Amelia, who was affected\r\nby my success, and shall always think with gratitude of the protection\r\nwith which that exalted lady honoured me. She was passionately fond of\r\nplay, as indeed were the ladies of almost all the Courts in Europe in\r\nthose days, and hence would often arise no small trouble to us; for the\r\ntruth must be told, that ladies love to play, certainly, but not to PAY.\r\nThe point of honour is not understood by the charming sex; and it was\r\nwith the greatest difficulty, in our peregrinations to the various\r\nCourts of Northern Europe, that we could keep them from the table, could\r\nget their money if they lost, or, if they paid, prevent them from using\r\nthe most furious and extraordinary means of revenge. In those great days\r\nof our fortune, I calculate that we lost no less than fourteen thousand\r\nlouis by such failures of payment. A princess of a ducal house gave us\r\npaste instead of diamonds, which she had solemnly pledged to us; another\r\norganised a robbery of the Crown jewels, and would have charged the\r\ntheft upon us, but for Pippi\xe2\x80\x99s caution, who had kept back a note of hand\r\n\xe2\x80\x98her High Transparency\xe2\x80\x99 gave us, and sent it to his ambassador; by which\r\nprecaution I do believe our necks were saved. A third lady of high (but\r\nnot princely) rank, after I had won a considerable sum in diamonds and\r\npearls from her, sent her lover with a band of cut-throats to waylay me;\r\nand it was only by extraordinary courage, skill, and good luck, that\r\nI escaped from these villains, wounded myself, but leaving the chief\r\naggressor dead on the ground: my sword entered his eye and broke there,\r\nand the villains who were with him fled, seeing their chief fall. They\r\nmight have finished me else, for I had no weapon of defence.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that our life, for all its splendour, was one of\r\nextreme danger and difficulty, requiring high talents and courage for\r\nsuccess; and often, when we were in a full vein of success, we were\r\nsuddenly driven from our ground on account of some freak of a reigning\r\nprince, some intrigue of a disappointed mistress, or some quarrel with\r\nthe police minister. If the latter personage were not bribed or won\r\nover, nothing was more common than for us to receive a sudden order of\r\ndeparture; and so, perforce, we lived a wandering and desultory life.\r\n\r\nThough the gains of such a life are, as I have said, very great, yet the\r\nexpenses are enormous. Our appearance and retinue was too splendid for\r\nthe narrow mind of Pippi, who was always crying out at my extravagance,\r\nthough obliged to own that his own meanness and parsimony would never\r\nhave achieved the great victories which my generosity had won. With all\r\nour success, our capital was not very great. That speech to the Duke\r\nof Courland, for instance, was a mere boast as far as the two hundred\r\nthousand florins at three months were concerned. We had no credit, and\r\nno money beyond that on our table, and should have been forced to fly if\r\nhis Highness had won and accepted our bills. Sometimes, too, we were\r\nhit very hard. A bank is a certainty, ALMOST; but now and then a bad day\r\nwill come; and men who have the courage of good fortune, at least, ought\r\nto meet bad luck well: the former, believe me, is the harder task of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nOne of these evil chances befell us in the Duke of Baden\xe2\x80\x99s territory, at\r\nMannheim. Pippi, who was always on the look-out for business, offered\r\nto make a bank at the inn where we put up, and where the officers of the\r\nDuke\xe2\x80\x99s cuirassiers supped; and some small play accordingly took place,\r\nand some wretched crowns and louis changed hands: I trust, rather to\r\nthe advantage of these poor gentlemen of the army, who are surely the\r\npoorest of all devils under the sun.\r\n\r\nBut, as ill luck would have it, a couple of young students from the\r\nneighbouring University of Heidelberg, who had come to Mannheim for\r\ntheir quarter\xe2\x80\x99s revenue, and so had some hundred of dollars between\r\nthem, were introduced to the table, and, having never played before,\r\nbegan to win (as is always the case). As ill luck would have it, too,\r\nthey were tipsy, and against tipsiness I have often found the best\r\ncalculations of play fail entirely. They played in the most perfectly\r\ninsane way, and yet won always. Every card they backed turned up in\r\ntheir favour. They had won a hundred louis from us in ten minutes; and,\r\nseeing that Pippi was growing angry and the luck against us, I was for\r\nshutting up the bank for the night, saying the play was only meant for a\r\njoke, and that now we had had enough.\r\n\r\nBut Pippi, who had quarrelled with me that day, was determined to\r\nproceed, and the upshot was, that the students played and won more;\r\nthen they lent money to the officers, who began to win, too; and in this\r\nignoble way, in a tavern room thick with tobacco-smoke, across a\r\ndeal table besmeared with beer and liquor, and to a parcel of hungry\r\nsubalterns and a pair of beardless students, three of the most skilful\r\nand renowned players in Europe lost seventeen hundred louis! I blush\r\nnow when I think of it. It was like Charles XII or Richard Coeur de Lion\r\nfalling before a petty fortress and an unknown hand (as my friend Mr.\r\nJohnson wrote), and was, in fact, a most shameful defeat.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only defeat. When our poor conquerors had gone off,\r\nbewildered with the treasure which fortune had flung in their way\r\n(one of these students was called the Baron de Clootz, perhaps he who\r\nafterwards lost his head at Paris), Pippi resumed the quarrel of the\r\nmorning, and some exceedingly high words passed between us. Among other\r\nthings I recollect I knocked him down with a stool, and was for flinging\r\nhim out of the window; but my uncle, who was cool, and had been\r\nkeeping Lent with his usual solemnity, interposed between us, and a\r\nreconciliation took place, Pippi apologising and confessing he had been\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nI ought to have doubted, however, the sincerity of the treacherous\r\nItalian; indeed, as I never before believed a word that he said in his\r\nlife, I know not why I was so foolish as to credit him now, and go to\r\nbed, leaving the keys of our cash-box with him. It contained, after our\r\nloss to the cuirassiers, in bills and money, near upon L8000 sterling.\r\nPippi insisted that our reconciliation should be ratified over a bowl of\r\nhot wine, and I have no doubt put some soporific drug into the liquor;\r\nfor my uncle and I both slept till very late the next morning, and woke\r\nwith violent headaches and fever: we did not quit our beds till noon. He\r\nhad been gone twelve hours, leaving our treasury empty; and behind him\r\na sort of calculation, by which he strove to make out that this was his\r\nshare of the profits, and that all the losses had been incurred without\r\nhis consent.\r\n\r\nThus, after eighteen months, we had to begin the world again. But was I\r\ncast down? No. Our wardrobes still were worth a very large sum of money;\r\nfor gentlemen did not dress like parish-clerks in those days, and\r\na person of fashion would often wear a suit of clothes and a set of\r\nornaments that would be a shop-boy\xe2\x80\x99s fortune; so, without repining for\r\none single minute, or saying a single angry word (my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s temper in\r\nthis respect was admirable), or allowing the secret of our loss to\r\nbe known to a mortal soul, we pawned three-fourths of our jewels and\r\nclothes to Moses Lowe the banker, and with the produce of the sale, and\r\nour private pocket-money, amounting in all to something less than 800\r\nlouis, we took the field again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. MORE RUNS OF LUCK\r\n\r\nI am not going to entertain my readers with an account of my\r\nprofessional career as a gamester, any more than I did with anecdotes of\r\nmy life as a military man. I might fill volumes with tales of this kind\r\nwere I so minded; but at this rate, my recital would not be brought to\r\na conclusion for years, and who knows how soon I may be called upon to\r\nstop? I have gout, rheumatism, gravel, and a disordered liver. I have\r\ntwo or three wounds in my body, which break out every now and then, and\r\ngive me intolerable pain, and a hundred more signs of breaking up.\r\nSuch are the effects of time, illness, and free-living, upon one of\r\nthe strongest constitutions and finest forms the world ever saw. Ah! I\r\nsuffered from none of these ills in the year \xe2\x80\x9866, when there was no\r\nman in Europe more gay in spirits, more splendid in personal\r\naccomplishments, than young Redmond Barry.\r\n\r\nBefore the treachery of the scoundrel Pippi, I had visited many of\r\nthe best Courts of Europe; especially the smaller ones, where play was\r\npatronised, and the professors of that science always welcome. Among\r\nthe ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine we were particularly well\r\nreceived. I never knew finer or gayer Courts than those of the Electors\r\nof Treves and Cologne, where there was more splendour and gaiety than at\r\nVienna; far more than in the wretched barrack-court of Berlin. The Court\r\nof the Archduchess-Governess of the Netherlands was, likewise, a royal\r\nplace for us knights of the dice-box and gallant votaries of fortune;\r\nwhereas in the stingy Dutch or the beggarly Swiss republics, it was\r\nimpossible for a gentleman to gain a livelihood unmolested.\r\n\r\nAfter our mishap at Mannheim, my uncle and I made for the Duchy of X---.\r\nThe reader may find out the place easily enough; but I do not choose to\r\nprint at full the names of some illustrious persons in whose society I\r\nthen fell, and among whom I was made the sharer in a very strange and\r\ntragical adventure.\r\n\r\nThere was no Court in Europe at which strangers were more welcome than\r\nat that of the noble Duke of X---; none where pleasure was more eagerly\r\nsought after, and more splendidly enjoyed. The Prince did not inhabit\r\nhis capital of S---, but, imitating in every respect the ceremonial of\r\nthe Court of Versailles, built himself a magnificent palace at a\r\nfew leagues from his chief city, and round about his palace a superb\r\naristocratic town, inhabited entirely by his nobles, and the officers of\r\nhis sumptuous Court. The people were rather hardly pressed, to be sure,\r\nin order to keep up this splendour; for his Highness\xe2\x80\x99s dominions were\r\nsmall, and so he wisely lived in a sort of awful retirement from them,\r\nseldom showing his face in his capital, or seeing any countenances but\r\nthose of his faithful domestics and officers. His palace and gardens of\r\nLudwigslust were exactly on the French model. Twice a week there were\r\nCourt receptions, and grand Court galas twice a month. There was the\r\nfinest opera out of France, and a ballet unrivalled in splendour;\r\non which his Highness, a great lover of music and dancing, expended\r\nprodigious sums. It may be because I was then young, but I think I never\r\nsaw such an assemblage of brilliant beauty as used to figure there on\r\nthe stage of the Court theatre, in the grand mythological ballets which\r\nwere then the mode, and in which you saw Mars in red-heeled pumps and\r\na periwig, and Venus in patches and a hoop. They say the costume was\r\nincorrect, and have changed it since; but for my part, I have never\r\nseen a Venus more lovely than the Coralie, who was the chief dancer, and\r\nfound no fault with the attendant nymphs, in their trains, and lappets,\r\nand powder. These operas used to take place twice a week, after\r\nwhich some great officer of the Court would have his evening, and his\r\nbrilliant supper, and the dice-box rattled everywhere, and all the world\r\nplayed. I have seen seventy play-tables set out in the grand gallery\r\nof Ludwigslust, besides the faro-bank; where the Duke himself would\r\ngraciously come and play, and win or lose with a truly royal splendour.\r\n\r\nIt was hither we came after the Mannheim misfortune. The nobility of the\r\nCourt were pleased to say our reputation had preceded us, and the two\r\nIrish gentleman were made welcome. The very first night at Court we lost\r\n740 of our 800 louis; the next evening, at the Court Marshal\xe2\x80\x99s table, I\r\nwon them back, with 1300 more. You may be sure we allowed no one to know\r\nhow near we were to ruin on the first evening; but, on the contrary,\r\nI endeared every one to me by my gay manner of losing, and the Finance\r\nMinister himself cashed a note for 400 ducats, drawn by me upon my\r\nsteward of Ballybarry Castle in the kingdom of Ireland; which very note\r\nI won from his Excellency the next day, along with a considerable sum in\r\nready cash. In that noble Court everybody was a gambler. You would see\r\nthe lacqueys in the ducal ante-rooms at work with their dirty packs of\r\ncards; the coach and chair men playing in the court, while their masters\r\nwere punting in the saloons above; the very cook-maids and scullions, I\r\nwas told, had a bank, where one of them, an Italian confectioner, made\r\na handsome fortune: he purchased afterwards a Roman marquisate, and\r\nhis son has figured as one of the most fashionable of the illustrious\r\nforeigners in London. The poor devils of soldiers played away their pay\r\nwhen they got it, which was seldom; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there was an\r\nofficer in any one of the guard regiments but had his cards in his\r\npouch, and no more forgot his dice than his sword-knot. Among such\r\nfellows it was diamond cut diamond. What you call fair play would have\r\nbeen a folly. The gentlemen of Ballybarry would have been fools indeed\r\nto appear as pigeons in such a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s nest. None but men of courage and\r\ngenius could live and prosper in a society where every one was bold and\r\nclever; and here my uncle and I held our own: ay, and more than our own.\r\n\r\nHis Highness the Duke was a widower, or rather, since the death of the\r\nreigning Duchess, had contracted a morganatic marriage with a lady\r\nwhom he had ennobled, and who considered it a compliment (such was the\r\nmorality of those days) to be called the Northern Dubarry. He had been\r\nmarried very young, and his son, the Hereditary Prince, may be said to\r\nhave been the political sovereign of the State: for the reigning Duke\r\nwas fonder of pleasure than of politics, and loved to talk a great deal\r\nmore with his grand huntsman, or the director of his opera, than with\r\nministers and ambassadors.\r\n\r\nThe Hereditary Prince, whom I shall call Prince Victor, was of a very\r\ndifferent character from his august father. He had made the Wars of the\r\nSuccession and Seven Years with great credit in the Empress\xe2\x80\x99s service,\r\nwas of a stern character, seldom appeared at Court, except when ceremony\r\ncalled him, but lived almost alone in his wing of the palace, where he\r\ndevoted himself to the severest studies, being a great astronomer and\r\nchemist. He shared in the rage then common throughout Europe, of hunting\r\nfor the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s stone; and my uncle often regretted that he had no\r\nsmattering of chemistry, like Balsamo (who called himself Cagliostro),\r\nSt. Germain, and other individuals, who had obtained very great sums\r\nfrom Duke Victor by aiding him in his search after the great secret. His\r\namusements were hunting and reviewing the troops; but for him, and if\r\nhis good-natured father had not had his aid, the army would have been\r\nplaying at cards all day, and so it was well that the prudent prince was\r\nleft to govern.\r\n\r\nDuke Victor was fifty years of age, and his princess, the Princess\r\nOlivia, was scarce three-and-twenty. They had been married seven years,\r\nand in the first years of their union the Princess had borne him a son\r\nand a daughter. The stern morals and manners, the dark and ungainly\r\nappearance, of the husband, were little likely to please the brilliant\r\nand fascinating young woman, who had been educated in the south (she\r\nwas connected with the ducal house of S---), who had passed two years\r\nat Paris under the guardianship of Mesdames the daughters of His Most\r\nChristian Majesty, and who was the life and soul of the Court of X---,\r\nthe gayest of the gay, the idol of her august father-in-law, and,\r\nindeed, of the whole Court. She was not beautiful, but charming; not\r\nwitty, but charming, too, in her conversation as in her person. She was\r\nextravagant beyond all measure; so false, that you could not trust her;\r\nbut her very weaknesses were more winning than the virtues of other\r\nwomen, her selfishness more delightful than others\xe2\x80\x99 generosity. I never\r\nknew a woman whose faults made her so attractive. She used to ruin\r\npeople, and yet they all loved her. My old uncle has seen her cheating\r\nat ombre, and let her win 400 louis without resisting in the least. Her\r\ncaprices with the officers and ladies of her household were ceaseless:\r\nbut they adored her. She was the only one of the reigning family whom\r\nthe people worshipped. She never went abroad but they followed her\r\ncarriage with shouts of acclamation: and, to be generous to them, she\r\nwould borrow the last penny from one of her poor maids of honour,\r\nwhom she would never pay. In the early days her husband was as much\r\nfascinated by her as all the rest of the world was; but her caprices had\r\ncaused frightful outbreaks of temper on his part, and an estrangement\r\nwhich, though interrupted by almost mad returns of love, was still\r\ngeneral. I speak of her Royal Highness with perfect candour and\r\nadmiration, although I might be pardoned for judging her more severely,\r\nconsidering her opinion of myself. She said the elder Monsieur de\r\nBalibari was a finished old gentleman, and the younger one had the\r\nmanners of a courier. The world has given a different opinion, and I can\r\nafford to chronicle this almost single sentence against me. Besides, she\r\nhad a reason for her dislike to me, which you shall hear.\r\n\r\nFive years in the army, long experience of the world, had ere now\r\ndispelled any of those romantic notions regarding love with which I\r\ncommenced life; and I had determined, as is proper with gentlemen (it\r\nis only your low people who marry for mere affection), to consolidate my\r\nfortunes by marriage. In the course of our peregrinations, my uncle\r\nand I had made several attempts to carry this object into effect; but\r\nnumerous disappointments had occurred which are not worth mentioning\r\nhere, and had prevented me hitherto from making such a match as I\r\nthought was worthy of a man of my birth, abilities, and personal\r\nappearance. Ladies are not in the habit of running away on the\r\nContinent, as is the custom in England (a custom whereby many\r\nhonourable gentlemen of my country have much benefited!); guardians, and\r\nceremonies, and difficulties of all kinds intervene; true love is not\r\nallowed to have its course, and poor women cannot give away their honest\r\nhearts to the gallant fellows who have won them. Now it was settlements\r\nthat were asked for; now it was my pedigree and title-deeds that were\r\nnot satisfactory: though I had a plan and rent-roll of the Ballybarry\r\nestates, and the genealogy of the family up to King Brian Boru, or\r\nBarry, most handsomely designed on paper; now it was a young lady who\r\nwas whisked off to a convent just as she was ready to fall into my arms;\r\non another occasion, when a rich widow of the Low Countries was about to\r\nmake me lord of a noble estate in Flanders, comes an order of the police\r\nwhich drives me out of Brussels at an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and consigns my\r\nmourner to her chateau. But at X---I had an opportunity of playing a\r\ngreat game: and had won it too, but for the dreadful catastrophe which\r\nupset my fortune.\r\n\r\nIn the household of the Hereditary Princess there was a lady nineteen\r\nyears of age, and possessor of the greatest fortune in the whole duchy.\r\nThe Countess Ida, such was her name, was daughter of a late Minister and\r\nfavourite of his Highness the Duke of X---and his Duchess, who had done\r\nher the honour to be her sponsors at birth, and who, at the father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, had taken her under their august guardianship and protection. At\r\nsixteen she was brought from her castle, where, up to that period, she\r\nhad been permitted to reside, and had been placed with the Princess\r\nOlivia, as one of her Highness\xe2\x80\x99s maids of honour.\r\n\r\nThe aunt of the Countess Ida, who presided over her house during her\r\nminority, had foolishly allowed her to contract an attachment for her\r\ncousin-german, a penniless sub-lieutenant in one of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s foot\r\nregiments, who had flattered himself to be able to carry off this rich\r\nprize; and if he had not been a blundering silly idiot indeed, with the\r\nadvantage of seeing her constantly, of having no rival near him, and the\r\nintimacy attendant upon close kinsmanship, might easily, by a private\r\nmarriage, have secured the young Countess and her possessions. But\r\nhe managed matters so foolishly, that he allowed her to leave her\r\nretirement, to come to Court for a year, and take her place in the\r\nPrincess Olivia\xe2\x80\x99s household; and then what does my young gentleman do,\r\nbut appear at the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s levee one day, in his tarnished epaulet and\r\nthreadbare coat, and make an application in due form to his Highness,\r\nas the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s guardian, for the hand of the richest heiress in his\r\ndominions!\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the good-natured Prince was such that, as the Countess\r\nIda herself was quite as eager for the match as her silly cousin,\r\nhis Highness might have been induced to allow the match, had not the\r\nPrincess Olivia been induced to interpose, and to procure from the\r\nDuke a peremptory veto to the hopes of the young man. The cause of this\r\nrefusal was as yet unknown; no other suitor for the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nwas mentioned, and the lovers continued to correspond, hoping that time\r\nmight effect a change in his Highness\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions; when, of a sudden,\r\nthe lieutenant was drafted into one of the regiments which the Prince\r\nwas in the habit of selling to the great powers then at war (this\r\nmilitary commerce was a principal part of his Highness\xe2\x80\x99s and other\r\nprinces\xe2\x80\x99 revenues in those days), and their connection was thus abruptly\r\nbroken off.\r\n\r\nIt was strange that the Princess Olivia should have taken this part\r\nagainst a young lady who had been her favourite; for, at first, with\r\nthose romantic and sentimental notions which almost every woman has, she\r\nhad somewhat encouraged the Countess Ida and her penniless lover, but\r\nnow suddenly turned against them; and, from loving the Countess, as she\r\npreviously had done, pursued her with every manner of hatred which a\r\nwoman knows how to inflict: there was no end to the ingenuity of her\r\ntortures, the venom of her tongue, the bitterness of her sarcasm and\r\nscorn. When I first came to Court at X--, the young fellows there had\r\nnicknamed the young lady the Dumme Grafinn, the stupid Countess. She\r\nwas generally silent, handsome, but pale, stolid-looking, and awkward;\r\ntaking no interest in the amusements of the place, and appearing in the\r\nmidst of the feasts as glum as the death\xe2\x80\x99s-head which, they say, the\r\nRomans used to have at their tables.\r\n\r\nIt was rumoured that a young gentleman of French extraction, the\r\nChevalier de Magny, equerry to the Hereditary Prince, and present at\r\nParis when the Princess Olivia was married to him by proxy there, was\r\nthe intended of the rich Countess Ida; but no official declaration\r\nof the kind was yet made, and there were whispers of a dark intrigue:\r\nwhich, subsequently, received frightful confirmation.\r\n\r\nThis Chevalier de Magny was the grandson of an old general officer in\r\nthe Duke\xe2\x80\x99s service, the Baron de Magny. The Baron\xe2\x80\x99s father had quitted\r\nFrance at the expulsion of Protestants after the revocation of the edict\r\nof Nantes, and taken service in X--, where he died. The son succeeded\r\nhim, and, quite unlike most French gentlemen of birth whom I have known,\r\nwas a stern and cold Calvinist, rigid in the performance of his duty,\r\nretiring in his manners, mingling little with the Court, and a close\r\nfriend and favourite of Duke Victor; whom he resembled in disposition.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier his grandson was a true Frenchman; he had been born in\r\nFrance, where his father held a diplomatic appointment in the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice. He had mingled in the gay society of the most brilliant Court\r\nin the world, and had endless stories to tell us of the pleasures of the\r\npetites maisons, of the secrets of the Parc aux Cerfs, and of the wild\r\ngaieties of Richelieu and his companions. He had been almost ruined at\r\nplay, as his father had been before him; for, out of the reach of the\r\nstern old Baron in Germany, both son and grandson had led the most\r\nreckless of lives. He came back from Paris soon after the embassy which\r\nhad been despatched thither on the occasion of the marriage of the\r\nPrincess, was received sternly by his old grandfather; who, however,\r\npaid his debts once more, and procured him the post in the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold. The Chevalier de Magny rendered himself a great favourite\r\nof his august master; he brought with him the modes and the gaieties\r\nof Paris; he was the deviser of all the masquerades and balls, the\r\nrecruiter of the ballet-dancers, and by far the most brilliant and\r\nsplendid young gentleman of the Court.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been a few weeks at Ludwigslust, the old Baron de Magny\r\nendeavoured to have us dismissed from the duchy; but his voice was not\r\nstrong enough to overcome that of the general public, and the Chevalier\r\nde Magny especially stood our friend with his Highness when the question\r\nwas debated before him. The Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s love of play had not deserted\r\nhim. He was a regular frequenter of our bank, where he played for some\r\ntime with pretty good luck; and where, when he began to lose, he paid\r\nwith a regularity surprising to all those who knew the smallness of his\r\nmeans, and the splendour of his appearance.\r\n\r\nHer Highness the Princess Olivia was also very fond of play. On\r\nhalf-a-dozen occasions when we held a bank at Court, I could see her\r\npassion for the game. I could see--that is, my cool-headed old uncle\r\ncould see--much more. There was an intelligence between Monsieur de\r\nMagny and this illustrious lady. \xe2\x80\x98If her Highness be not in love with\r\nthe little Frenchman,\xe2\x80\x99 my uncle said to me one night after play, \xe2\x80\x98may I\r\nlose the sight of my last eye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what then, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What then?\xe2\x80\x99 said my uncle, looking me hard in the face. \xe2\x80\x98Are you so\r\ngreen as not to know what then? Your fortune is to be made, if you\r\nchoose to back it now; and we may have back the Barry estates in two\r\nyears, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is that?\xe2\x80\x99 asked I, still at a loss.\r\n\r\nMy uncle drily said, \xe2\x80\x98Get Magny to play; never mind his paying: take\r\nhis notes of hand. The more he owes the better; but, above all, make him\r\nplay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He can\xe2\x80\x99t pay a shilling,\xe2\x80\x99 answered I. \xe2\x80\x98The Jews will not discount his\r\nnotes at cent. per cent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the better. You shall see we will make use of them,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthe old gentleman. And I must confess that the plan he laid was a\r\ngallant, clever, and fair one.\r\n\r\nI was to make Magny play; in this there was no great difficulty. We had\r\nan intimacy together, for he was a good sportsman as well as myself, and\r\nwe came to have a pretty considerable friendship for one another; if he\r\nsaw a dice-box it was impossible to prevent him from handling it; but he\r\ntook to it as natural as a child does to sweetmeats.\r\n\r\nAt first he won of me; then he began to lose; then I played him money\r\nagainst some jewels that he brought: family trinkets, he said, and\r\nindeed of considerable value. He begged me, however, not to dispose of\r\nthem in the duchy, and I gave and kept my word to him to this effect.\r\nFrom jewels he got to playing upon promissory notes; and as they would\r\nnot allow him to play at the Court tables and in public upon credit, he\r\nwas very glad to have an opportunity of indulging his favourite passion\r\nin private. I have had him for hours at my pavilion (which I had fitted\r\nup in the Eastern manner, very splendid) rattling the dice till it\r\nbecame time to go to his service at Court, and we would spend day after\r\nday in this manner. He brought me more jewels,--a pearl necklace,\r\nan antique emerald breast ornament, and other trinkets, as a set-off\r\nagainst these losses: for I need not say that I should not have played\r\nwith him all this time had he been winning; but, after about a week, the\r\nluck set in against him, and he became my debtor in a prodigious sum. I\r\ndo not care to mention the extent of it; it was such as I never thought\r\nthe young man could pay.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, did I play for it? Why waste days in private play with a mere\r\nbankrupt, when business seemingly much more profitable was to be done\r\nelsewhere? My reason I boldly confess. I wanted to win from Monsieur de\r\nMagny, not his money, but his intended wife, the Countess Ida. Who can\r\nsay that I had not a right to use ANY stratagem in this matter of love?\r\nOr, why say love? I wanted the wealth of the lady: I loved her quite as\r\nmuch as Magny did; I loved her quite as much as yonder blushing virgin\r\nof seventeen does who marries an old lord of seventy. I followed the\r\npractice of the world in this; having resolved that marriage should\r\nachieve my fortune.\r\n\r\nI used to make Magny, after his losses, give me a friendly letter of\r\nacknowledgment to some such effect as this,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR MONSIEUR DE BALIBARI,--I acknowledge to have lost to you this\r\nday at lansquenet [or picquet, or hazard, as the case may be: I was\r\nmaster of him at any game that is played] the sum of three hundred\r\nducats, and shall hold it as a great kindness on your part if you will\r\nallow the debt to stand over until a future day, when you shall receive\r\npayment from your very grateful humble servant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith the jewels he brought me I also took the precaution (but this was\r\nmy uncle\xe2\x80\x99s idea, and a very good one) to have a sort of invoice, and a\r\nletter begging me to receive the trinkets as so much part payment of a\r\nsum of money he owed me.\r\n\r\nWhen I had put him in such a position as I deemed favourable to my\r\nintentions, I spoke to him candidly, and without any reserve, as one man\r\nof the world should speak to another. \xe2\x80\x98I will not, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x98pay you so bad a compliment as to suppose that you expect we are\r\nto go on playing at this rate much longer, and that there is any\r\nsatisfaction to me in possessing more or less sheets of paper bearing\r\nyour signature, and a series of notes of hand which I know you never\r\ncan pay. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look fierce or angry, for you know Redmond Barry is your\r\nmaster at the sword; besides, I would not be such a fool as to fight a\r\nman who owes me so much money; but hear calmly what I have to propose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been very confidential to me during our intimacy of the last\r\nmonth; and I know all your personal affairs completely. You have given\r\nyour word of honour to your grandfather never to play upon parole, and\r\nyou know how you have kept it, and that he will disinherit you if he\r\nhears the truth. Nay, suppose he dies to-morrow, his estate is not\r\nsufficient to pay the sum in which you are indebted to me; and, were you\r\nto yield me up all, you would be a beggar, and a bankrupt too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her Highness the Princess Olivia denies you nothing. I shall not ask\r\nwhy; but give me leave to say, I was aware of the fact when we began to\r\nplay together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you be made baron-chamberlain, with the grand cordon of the\r\norder?\xe2\x80\x99 gasped the poor fellow. \xe2\x80\x98The Princess can do anything with the\r\nDuke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall have no objection,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98to the yellow riband and the gold\r\nkey; though a gentleman of the house of Ballybarry cares little for\r\nthe titles of the German nobility. But this is not what I want. My good\r\nChevalier, you have hid no secrets from me. You have told me with\r\nwhat difficulty you have induced the Princess Olivia to consent to the\r\nproject of your union with the Grafinn Ida, whom you don\xe2\x80\x99t love. I know\r\nwhom you love very well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Monsieur de Balibari!\xe2\x80\x99 said the discomfited Chevalier; he could get out\r\nno more. The truth began to dawn upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You begin to understand,\xe2\x80\x99 continued I. \xe2\x80\x98Her Highness the Princess\xe2\x80\x99 (I\r\nsaid this in a sarcastic way) \xe2\x80\x98will not be very angry, believe me, if\r\nyou break off your connection with the stupid Countess. I am no more an\r\nadmirer of that lady than you are; but I want her estate. I played you\r\nfor that estate, and have won it; and I will give you your bills and\r\nfive thousand ducats on the day I am married to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The day _I_ am married to the Countess,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the Chevalier,\r\nthinking to have me, \xe2\x80\x98I will be able to raise money to pay your claim\r\nten times over\xe2\x80\x99 (this was true, for the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s property may have\r\nbeen valued at near half a million of our money); \xe2\x80\x98and then I will\r\ndischarge my obligations to you. Meanwhile, if you annoy me by threats,\r\nor insult me again as you have done, I will use that influence, which,\r\nas you say, I possess, and have you turned out of the duchy, as you were\r\nout of the Netherlands last year.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI rang the bell quite quietly. \xe2\x80\x98Zamor,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to a tall negro fellow\r\nhabited like a Turk, that used to wait upon me, \xe2\x80\x98when you hear the bell\r\nring a second time, you will take this packet to the Marshal of the\r\nCourt, this to his Excellency the General de Magny, and this you\r\nwill place in the hands of one of the equerries of his Highness the\r\nHereditary Prince. Wait in the ante-room, and do not go with the parcels\r\nuntil I ring again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe black fellow having retired, I turned to Monsieur de Magny and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chevalier, the first packet contains a letter from you to me, declaring\r\nyour solvency, and solemnly promising payment of the sums you owe me; it\r\nis accompanied by a document from myself (for I expected some resistance\r\non your part), stating that my honour has been called in question,\r\nand begging that the paper may be laid before your august master his\r\nHighness. The second packet is for your grandfather, enclosing the\r\nletter from you in which you state yourself to be his heir, and begging\r\nfor a confirmation of the fact. The last parcel, for his Highness the\r\nHereditary Duke,\xe2\x80\x99 added I, looking most sternly, \xe2\x80\x98contains the Gustavus\r\nAdolphus emerald, which he gave to his princess, and which you pledged\r\nto me as a family jewel of your own. Your influence with her Highness\r\nmust be great indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 I concluded, \xe2\x80\x98when you could extort from her\r\nsuch a jewel as that, and when you could make her, in order to pay your\r\nplay-debts, give up a secret upon which both your heads depend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Villain!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Frenchman, quite aghast with fury and terror, \xe2\x80\x98would\r\nyou implicate the Princess?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Monsieur de Magny,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, with a sneer, \xe2\x80\x98no: I will say YOU STOLE\r\nthe jewel.\xe2\x80\x99 It was my belief he did, and that the unhappy and infatuated\r\nPrincess was never privy to the theft until long after it had been\r\ncommitted. How we came to know the history of the emerald is simple\r\nenough. As we wanted money (for my occupation with Magny caused our bank\r\nto be much neglected), my uncle had carried Magny\xe2\x80\x99s trinkets to Mannheim\r\nto pawn. The Jew who lent upon them knew the history of the stone in\r\nquestion; and when he asked how her Highness came to part with it, my\r\nuncle very cleverly took up the story where he found it, said that the\r\nPrincess was very fond of play, that it was not always convenient to\r\nher to pay, and hence the emerald had come into our hands. He brought it\r\nwisely back with him to S--; and, as regards the other jewels which the\r\nChevalier pawned to us, they were of no particular mark: no inquiries\r\nhave ever been made about them to this day; and I did not only not know\r\nthen that they came from her Highness, but have only my conjectures upon\r\nthe matter now.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate young gentleman must have had a cowardly spirit, when I\r\ncharged him with the theft, not to make use of my two pistols that were\r\nlying by chance before him, and to send out of the world his accuser and\r\nhis own ruined self. With such imprudence and miserable recklessness on\r\nhis part and that of the unhappy lady who had forgotten herself for this\r\npoor villain, he must have known that discovery was inevitable. But it\r\nwas written that this dreadful destiny should be accomplished: instead\r\nof ending like a man, he now cowered before me quite spirit-broken, and,\r\nflinging himself down on the sofa, burst into tears, calling wildly upon\r\nall the saints to help him: as if they could be interested in the fate\r\nof such a wretch as he!\r\n\r\nI saw that I had nothing to fear from him; and, calling back Zamor my\r\nblack, said I would myself carry the parcels, which I returned to my\r\nescritoire; and, my point being thus gained, I acted, as I always do,\r\ngenerously towards him. I said that, for security\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I should send\r\nthe emerald out of the country, but that I pledged my honour to restore\r\nit to the Duchess, without any pecuniary consideration, on the day when\r\nshe should procure the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s consent to my union with the Countess\r\nIda.\r\n\r\nThis will explain pretty clearly, I flatter myself, the game I was\r\nplaying; and, though some rigid moralist may object to its propriety, I\r\nsay that anything is fair in love, and that men so poor as myself can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafford to be squeamish about their means of getting on in life. The\r\ngreat and rich are welcomed, smiling, up the grand staircase of the\r\nworld; the poor but aspiring must clamber up the wall, or push and\r\nstruggle up the back stair, or, PARDI, crawl through any of the conduits\r\nof the house, never mind how foul and narrow, that lead to the top. The\r\nunambitious sluggard pretends that the eminence is not worth attaining,\r\ndeclines altogether the struggle, and calls himself a philosopher. I say\r\nhe is a poor-spirited coward. What is life good for but for honour? and\r\nthat is so indispensable, that we should attain it anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe manner to be adopted for Magny\xe2\x80\x99s retreat was proposed by myself, and\r\nwas arranged so as to consult the feelings of delicacy of both parties.\r\nI made Magny take the Countess Ida aside, and say to her, \xe2\x80\x98Madam, though\r\nI have never declared myself your admirer, you and the Court have had\r\nsufficient proof of my regard for you; and my demand would, I know, have\r\nbeen backed by his Highness, your august guardian. I know the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngracious wish is, that my attentions should be received favourably; but,\r\nas time has not appeared to alter your attachment elsewhere, and as I\r\nhave too much spirit to force a lady of your name and rank to be united\r\nto me against your will, the best plan is, that I should make you, for\r\nform\xe2\x80\x99s sake, a proposal UNauthorised by his Highness: that you should\r\nreply, as I am sorry to think your heart dictates to you, in the\r\nnegative: on which I also will formally withdraw from my pursuit of\r\nyou, stating that, after a refusal, nothing, not even the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s desire,\r\nshould induce me to persist in my suit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Countess Ida almost wept at hearing these words from Monsieur de\r\nMagny, and tears came into her eyes, he said, as she took his hand for\r\nthe first time, and thanked him for the delicacy of the proposal. She\r\nlittle knew that the Frenchman was incapable of that sort of delicacy,\r\nand that the graceful manner in which he withdrew his addresses was of\r\nmy invention.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he withdrew, it became my business to step forward; but\r\ncautiously and gently, so as not to alarm the lady, and yet firmly, so\r\nas to convince her of the hopelessness of her design of uniting herself\r\nwith her shabby lover, the sub-lieutenant. The Princess Olivia was good\r\nenough to perform this necessary part of the plan in my favour, and\r\nsolemnly to warn the Countess Ida, that, though Monsieur de Magny had\r\nretired from paying his addresses, his Highness her guardian would\r\nstill marry her as he thought fit, and that she must for ever forget her\r\nout-at-elbowed adorer. In fact, I can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive how such a shabby rogue\r\nas that could ever have had the audacity to propose for her: his birth\r\nwas certainly good; but what other qualifications had he?\r\n\r\nWhen the Chevalier de Magny withdrew, numbers of other suitors, you\r\nmay be sure, presented themselves; and amongst these your very humble\r\nservant, the cadet of Ballybarry. There was a carrousel, or tournament,\r\nheld at this period, in imitation of the antique meetings of chivalry,\r\nin which the chevaliers tilted at each other, or at the ring; and on\r\nthis occasion I was habited in a splendid Roman dress (viz., a silver\r\nhelmet, a flowing periwig, a cuirass of gilt leather richly embroidered,\r\na light blue velvet mantle, and crimson morocco half-boots): and in this\r\nhabit I rode my bay horse Brian, carried off three rings, and won\r\nthe prize over all the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s gentry, and the nobility of surrounding\r\ncountries who had come to the show. A wreath of gilded laurel was to\r\nbe the prize of the victor, and it was to be awarded by the lady he\r\nselected. So I rode up to the gallery where the Countess Ida was seated\r\nbehind the Hereditary Princess, and, calling her name loudly, yet\r\ngracefully, begged to be allowed to be crowned by her, and thus\r\nproclaimed myself to the face of all Germany, as it were, her suitor.\r\nShe turned very pale, and the Princess red, I observed; but the Countess\r\nIda ended by crowning me: after which, putting spurs into my horse, I\r\ngalloped round the ring, saluting his Highness the Duke at the opposite\r\nend, and performing the most wonderful exercises with my bay.\r\n\r\nMy success did not, as you may imagine, increase my popularity with the\r\nyoung gentry. They called me adventurer, bully, dice-loader, impostor,\r\nand a hundred pretty names; but I had a way of silencing these gentry.\r\nI took the Count de Schmetterling, the richest and bravest of the young\r\nmen who seemed to have a hankering for the Countess Ida, and publicly\r\ninsulted him at the ridotto; flinging my cards into his face. The next\r\nday I rode thirty-five miles into the territory of the Elector of B----,\r\nand met Monsieur de Schmetterling, and passed my sword twice through\r\nhis body; then rode back with my second, the Chevalier de Magny, and\r\npresented myself at the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s whist that evening. Magny was very\r\nunwilling to accompany me at first; but I insisted upon his support, and\r\nthat he should countenance my quarrel. Directly after paying my homage\r\nto her Highness, I went up to the Countess Ida, and made her a marked\r\nand low obeisance, gazing at her steadily in the face until she grew\r\ncrimson red; and then staring round at every man who formed her circle,\r\nuntil, MA FOI, I stared them all away. I instructed Magny to say,\r\neverywhere, that the Countess was madly in love with me; which\r\ncommission, along with many others of mine, the poor devil was obliged\r\nto perform. He made rather a SOTTE FIGURE, as the French say, acting the\r\npioneer for me, praising me everywhere, accompanying me always! he\r\nwho had been the pink of the MODE until my arrival; he who thought his\r\npedigree of beggarly Barons of Magny was superior to the race of great\r\nIrish kings from which I descended; who had sneered at me a hundred\r\ntimes as a spadassin, a deserter, and had called me a vulgar Irish\r\nupstart. Now I had my revenge of the gentleman, and took it too.\r\n\r\nI used to call him, in the choicest societies, by his Christian name\r\nof Maxime. I would say, \xe2\x80\x98Bon jour, Maxime; comment vas-TU?\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nPrincess\xe2\x80\x99s hearing, and could see him bite his lips for fury and\r\nvexation. But I had him under my thumb, and her Highness too--I, poor\r\nprivate of Bulow\xe2\x80\x99s regiment. And this is a proof of what genius and\r\nperseverance can do, and should act as a warning to great people never\r\nto have SECRETS--if they can help it.\r\n\r\nI knew the Princess hated me; but what did I care? She knew I knew all:\r\nand indeed, I believe, so strong was her prejudice against me, that she\r\nthought I was an indelicate villain, capable of betraying a lady, which\r\nI would scorn to do; so that she trembled before me as a child before\r\nits schoolmaster. She would, in her woman\xe2\x80\x99s way, too, make all sorts\r\nof jokes and sneers at me on reception days; ask about my palace in\r\nIreland, and the kings my ancestors, and whether, when I was a private\r\nin Bulow\xe2\x80\x99s foot, my royal relatives had interposed to rescue me, and\r\nwhether the cane was smartly administered there,--anything to mortify\r\nme. But, Heaven bless you! I can make allowances for people, and used to\r\nlaugh in her face. Whilst her jibes and jeers were continuing, it was my\r\npleasure to look at poor Magny and see how HE bore them. The poor devil\r\nwas trembling lest I should break out under the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s sarcasm and\r\ntell all; but my revenge was, when the Princess attacked me, to say\r\nsomething bitter to HIM,--to pass it on, as boys do at school. And THAT\r\nwas the thing which used to make her Highness feel. She would wince just\r\nas much when I attacked Magny as if I had been saying anything rude to\r\nherself. And, though she hated me, she used to beg my pardon in private;\r\nand though her pride would often get the better of her, yet her\r\nprudence obliged this magnificent princess to humble herself to the poor\r\npenniless Irish boy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Magny had formally withdrawn from the Countess Ida, the\r\nPrincess took the young lady into favour again, and pretended to be very\r\nfond of her. To do them justice, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which of the two disliked\r\nme most,--the Princess, who was all eagerness, and fire, and coquetry;\r\nor the Countess, who was all state and splendour. The latter,\r\nespecially, pretended to be disgusted by me: and yet, after all, I have\r\npleased her betters; was once one of the handsomest men in Europe, and\r\nwould defy any heyduc of the Court to measure a chest or a leg with me:\r\nbut I did not care for any of her silly prejudices, and determined\r\nto win her and wear her in spite of herself. Was it on account of\r\nher personal charms or qualities? No. She was quite white, thin,\r\nshort-sighted, tall, and awkward, and my taste is quite the contrary;\r\nand as for her mind, no wonder that a poor creature who had a hankering\r\nafter a wretched ragged ensign could never appreciate ME. It was her\r\nestate I made love to; as for herself, it would be a reflection on my\r\ntaste as a man of fashion to own that I liked her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. IN WHICH THE LUCK GOES AGAINST BARRY\r\n\r\nMy hopes of obtaining the hand of one of the richest heiresses in\r\nGermany were now, as far as all human probability went, and as far as\r\nmy own merits and prudence could secure my fortune, pretty certain of\r\ncompletion. I was admitted whenever I presented myself at the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napartments, and had as frequent opportunities as I desired of seeing\r\nthe Countess Ida there. I cannot say that she received me with any\r\nparticular favour; the silly young creature\xe2\x80\x99s affections were, as I have\r\nsaid, engaged ignobly elsewhere; and, however captivating my own person\r\nand manners may have been, it was not to be expected that she should all\r\nof a sudden forget her lover for the sake of the young Irish gentleman\r\nwho was paying his addresses to her. But such little rebuffs as I got\r\nwere far from discouraging me. I had very powerful friends, who were to\r\naid me in my undertaking; and knew that, sooner or later, the victory\r\nmust be mine. In fact, I only waited my time to press my suit. Who\r\ncould tell the dreadful stroke of fortune which was impending over my\r\nillustrious protectress, and which was to involve me partially in her\r\nruin?\r\n\r\nAll things seemed for a while quite prosperous to my wishes; and in\r\nspite of the Countess Ida\xe2\x80\x99s disinclination, it was much easier to\r\nbring her to her senses than, perhaps, may be supposed in a silly\r\nconstitutional country like England, where people are not brought up\r\nwith those wholesome sentiments of obedience to Royalty which were\r\ncustomary in Europe at the time when I was a young man.\r\n\r\nI have stated how, through Magny, I had the Princess, as it were, at my\r\nfeet. Her Highness had only to press the match upon the old Duke, over\r\nwhom her influence was unbounded, and to secure the goodwill of\r\nthe Countess of Liliengarten, (which was the romantic title of his\r\nHighness\xe2\x80\x99s morganatic spouse), and the easy old man would give an\r\norder for the marriage: which his ward would perforce obey. Madame de\r\nLiliengarten was, too, from her position, extremely anxious to oblige\r\nthe Princess Olivia; who might be called upon any day to occupy the\r\nthrone. The old Duke was tottering, apoplectic, and exceedingly fond of\r\ngood living. When he was gone, his relict would find the patronage of\r\nthe Duchess Olivia most necessary to her. Hence there was a close\r\nmutual understanding between the two ladies; and the world said that the\r\nHereditary Princess was already indebted to the favourite for help on\r\nvarious occasions. Her Highness had obtained, through the Countess,\r\nseveral large grants of money for the payment of her multifarious debts;\r\nand she was now good enough to exert her gracious influence over Madame\r\nde Liliengarten in order to obtain for me the object so near my\r\nheart. It is not to be supposed that my end was to be obtained without\r\ncontinual unwillingness and refusals on Magny\xe2\x80\x99s part; but I pushed\r\nmy point resolutely, and had means in my hands of overcoming the\r\nstubbornness of that feeble young gentleman. Also, I may say, without\r\nvanity, that if the high and mighty Princess detested me, the Countess\r\n(though she was of extremely low origin, it is said) had better taste\r\nand admired me. She often did us the honour to go partners with us in\r\none of our faro-banks, and declared that I was the handsomest man in the\r\nduchy. All I was required to prove was my nobility, and I got at Vienna\r\nsuch a pedigree as would satisfy the most greedy in that way. In fact,\r\nwhat had a man descended from the Barrys and the Bradys to fear before\r\nany VON in Germany? By way of making assurance doubly sure, I promised\r\nMadame de Liliengarten ten thousand louis on the day of my marriage, and\r\nshe knew that as a play-man I had never failed in my word: and I vow,\r\nthat had I paid fifty per cent. for it, I would have got the money.\r\n\r\nThus by my talents, honesty, and acuteness, I had, considering I was\r\na poor patronless outcast, raised for myself very powerful protectors.\r\nEven his Highness the Duke Victor was favourably inclined to me; for,\r\nhis favourite charger falling ill of the staggers, I gave him a ball\r\nsuch as my uncle Brady used to administer, and cured the horse; after\r\nwhich his Highness was pleased to notice me frequently. He invited me\r\nto his hunting and shooting parties, where I showed myself to be a good\r\nsportsman; and once or twice he condescended to talk to me about my\r\nprospects in life, lamenting that I had taken to gambling, and that I\r\nhad not adopted a more regular means of advancement. \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nyou will allow me to speak frankly to your Highness, play with me is\r\nonly a means to an end. Where should I have been without it? A private\r\nstill in King Frederick\xe2\x80\x99s grenadiers. I come of a race which gave\r\nprinces to my country; but persecutions have deprived them of their vast\r\npossessions. My uncle\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to his ancient faith drove him from\r\nour country. I too resolved to seek advancement in the military service;\r\nbut the insolence and ill-treatment which I received at the hands of\r\nthe English were not bearable by a high-born gentleman, and I fled their\r\nservice. It was only to fall into another bondage to all appearance\r\nstill more hopeless; when my good star sent a preserver to me in my\r\nuncle, and my spirit and gallantry enabled me to take advantage of the\r\nmeans of escape afforded me. Since then we have lived, I do not disguise\r\nit, by play; but who can say I have done him a wrong? Yet, if I could\r\nfind myself in an honourable post, and with an assured maintenance, I\r\nwould never, except for amusement, such as every gentleman must have,\r\ntouch a card again. I beseech your Highness to inquire of your resident\r\nat Berlin if I did not on every occasion act as a gallant soldier. I\r\nfeel that I have talents of a higher order, and should be proud to have\r\noccasion to exert them; if, as I do not doubt, my fortune shall bring\r\nthem into play.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe candour of this statement struck his Highness greatly, and impressed\r\nhim in my favour, and he was pleased to say that he believed me, and\r\nwould be glad to stand my friend.\r\n\r\nHaving thus the two Dukes, the Duchess, and the reigning favourite\r\nenlisted on my side, the chances certainly were that I should carry off\r\nthe great prize; and I ought, according to all common calculations, to\r\nhave been a Prince of the Empire at this present writing, but that\r\nmy ill luck pursued me in a matter in which I was not the least to\r\nblame,--the unhappy Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s attachment to the weak, silly, cowardly\r\nFrenchman. The display of this love was painful to witness, as its end\r\nwas frightful to think of. The Princess made no disguise of it. If\r\nMagny spoke a word to a lady of her household, she would be jealous, and\r\nattack with all the fury of her tongue the unlucky offender. She would\r\nsend him a half-dozen of notes in the day: at his arrival to join her\r\ncircle or the courts which she held, she would brighten up, so that all\r\nmight perceive. It was a wonder that her husband had not long ere this\r\nbeen made aware of her faithlessness; but the Prince Victor was himself\r\nof so high and stern a nature that he could not believe in her stooping\r\nso far from her rank as to forget her virtue: and I have heard say,\r\nthat when hints were given to him of the evident partiality which the\r\nPrincess showed for the equerry, his answer was a stern command never\r\nmore to be troubled on the subject. \xe2\x80\x98The Princess is light-minded,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x98she was brought up at a frivolous Court; but her folly goes not\r\nbeyond coquetry: crime is impossible; she has her birth, and my name,\r\nand her children, to defend her.\xe2\x80\x99 And he would ride off to his\r\nmilitary inspections and be absent for weeks, or retire to his suite of\r\napartments, and remain closeted there whole days; only appearing to\r\nmake a bow at her Highness\xe2\x80\x99s LEVEE, or to give her his hand at the Court\r\ngalas, where ceremony required that he should appear. He was a man of\r\nvulgar tastes, and I have seen him in the private garden, with his great\r\nungainly figure, running races, or playing at ball with his little son\r\nand daughter, whom he would find a dozen pretexts daily for visiting.\r\nThe serene children were brought to their mother every morning at\r\nher toilette; but she received them very indifferently: except on one\r\noccasion, when the young Duke Ludwig got his little uniform as colonel\r\nof hussars, being presented with a regiment by his godfather the Emperor\r\nLeopold. Then, for a day or two, the Duchess Olivia was charmed with\r\nthe little boy; but she grew tired of him speedily, as a child does of\r\na toy. I remember one day, in the morning circle, some of the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrouge came off on the arm of her son\xe2\x80\x99s little white military jacket; on\r\nwhich she slapped the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s face, and sent him sobbing away. Oh,\r\nthe woes that have been worked by women in this world! the misery into\r\nwhich men have lightly stepped with smiling faces; often not even with\r\nthe excuse of passion, but from mere foppery, vanity, and bravado! Men\r\nplay with these dreadful two-edged tools, as if no harm could come to\r\nthem. I, who have seen more of life than most men, if I had a son, would\r\ngo on my knees to him and beg him to avoid woman, who is worse than\r\npoison. Once intrigue, and your whole life is endangered: you never know\r\nwhen the evil may fall upon you; and the woe of whole families, and the\r\nruin of innocent people perfectly dear to you, may be caused by a moment\r\nof your folly.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw how entirely lost the unlucky Monsieur de Magny seemed to be,\r\nin spite of all the claims I had against him, I urged him to fly. He had\r\nrooms in the palace, in the garrets over the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s quarters\r\n(the building was a huge one, and accommodated almost a city of noble\r\nretainers of the family); but the infatuated young fool would not\r\nbudge, although he had not even the excuse of love for staying. \xe2\x80\x98How\r\nshe squints,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say of the Princess, \xe2\x80\x98and how crooked she is! She\r\nthinks no one can perceive her deformity. She writes me verses out of\r\nGresset or Crebillon, and fancies I believe them to be original. Bah!\r\nthey are no more her own than her hair is!\xe2\x80\x99 It was in this way that the\r\nwretched lad was dancing over the ruin that was yawning under him. I do\r\nbelieve that his chief pleasure in making love to the Princess was, that\r\nhe might write about his victories to his friends of the PETITES MAISONS\r\nat Paris, where he longed to be considered as a wit and a VAINQUEUR DE\r\nDAMES.\r\n\r\nSeeing the young man\xe2\x80\x99s recklessness, and the danger of his position,\r\nI became very anxious that MY little scheme should be brought to a\r\nsatisfactory end, and pressed him warmly on the matter.\r\n\r\nMy solicitations with him were, I need not say, from the nature of the\r\nconnection between us, generally pretty successful; and, in fact, the\r\npoor fellow could REFUSE ME NOTHING: as I used often laughingly to say\r\nto him, very little to his liking. But I used more than threats, or the\r\nlegitimate influence I had over him. I used delicacy and generosity;\r\nas a proof of which, I may mention that I promised to give back to the\r\nPrincess the family emerald, which I mentioned in the last chapter that\r\nI had won from her unprincipled admirer at play.\r\n\r\nThis was done by my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s consent, and was one of the usual acts of\r\nprudence and foresight which distinguish that clever man. \xe2\x80\x9cPress the\r\nmatter now, Redmond my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he would urge. \xe2\x80\x9cThis affair between her\r\nHighness and Magny must end ill for both of them, and that soon; and\r\nwhere will be your chance to win the Countess then? Now is your time!\r\nwin her and wear her before the month is over, and we will give up the\r\npunting business, and go live like noblemen at our castle in Swabia. Get\r\nrid of that emerald, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he added: \xe2\x80\x9cshould an accident happen, it will\r\nbe an ugly deposit found in our hand.\xe2\x80\x9d This it was that made me agree to\r\nforego the possession of the trinket; which, I must confess, I was\r\nloth to part with. It was lucky for us both that I did: as you shall\r\npresently hear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, then, I urged Magny: I myself spoke strongly to the Countess\r\nof Liliengarten, who promised formally to back my claim with his\r\nHighness the reigning Duke; and Monsieur de Magny was instructed to\r\ninduce the Princess Olivia to make a similar application to the old\r\nsovereign in my behalf. It was done. The two ladies urged the Prince;\r\nhis Highness (at a supper of oysters and champagne) was brought to\r\nconsent, and her Highness the Hereditary Princess did me the honour of\r\nnotifying personally to the Countess Ida that it was the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s will\r\nthat she should marry the young Irish nobleman, the Chevalier Redmond de\r\nBalibari. The notification was made in my presence; and though the young\r\nCountess said \xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99 and fell down in a swoon at her lady\xe2\x80\x99s feet, I\r\nwas, you may be sure, entirely unconcerned at this little display of\r\nmawkish sensibility, and felt, indeed, now that my prize was secure.\r\n\r\nThat evening I gave the Chevalier de Magny the emerald, which he\r\npromised to restore to the Princess; and now the only difficulty in my\r\nway lay with the Hereditary Prince, of whom his father, his wife, and\r\nthe favourite, were alike afraid. He might not be disposed to allow the\r\nrichest heiress in his duchy to be carried off by a noble, though not\r\na wealthy foreigner. Time was necessary in order to break the matter to\r\nPrince Victor. The Princess must find him at some moment of good-humour.\r\nHe had days of infatuation still, when he could refuse his wife nothing;\r\nand our plan was to wait for one of these, or for any other chance which\r\nmight occur.\r\n\r\nBut it was destined that the Princess should never see her husband at\r\nher feet, as often as he had been. Fate was preparing a terrible ending\r\nto her follies, and my own hope. In spite of his solemn promises to me,\r\nMagny never restored the emerald to the Princess Olivia.\r\n\r\nHe had heard, in casual intercourse with me, that my uncle and I had\r\nbeen beholden to Mr. Moses Lowe, the banker of Heidelberg, who had given\r\nus a good price for our valuables; and the infatuated young man took\r\na pretext to go thither, and offered the jewel for pawn. Moses Lowe\r\nrecognised the emerald at once, gave Magny the sum the latter demanded,\r\nwhich the Chevalier lost presently at play: never, you may be sure,\r\nacquainting us with the means by which he had made himself master of so\r\nmuch capital. We, for our parts, supposed that he had been supplied by\r\nhis usual banker, the Princess: and many rouleaux of his gold pieces\r\nfound their way into our treasury, when at the Court galas, at our own\r\nlodgings, or at the apartments of Madame de Liliengarten (who on these\r\noccasions did us the honour to go halves with us) we held our bank of\r\nfaro.\r\n\r\nThus Magny\xe2\x80\x99s money was very soon gone. But though the Jew held his\r\njewel, of thrice the value no doubt of the sums he had lent upon it,\r\nthat was not all the profit which he intended to have from his unhappy\r\ncreditor; over whom he began speedily to exercise his authority. His\r\nHebrew connections at X--, money-brokers, bankers, horse-dealers, about\r\nthe Court there, must have told their Heidelberg brother what Magny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelations with the Princess were; and the rascal determined to take\r\nadvantage of these, and to press to the utmost both victims. My\r\nuncle and I were, meanwhile, swimming upon the high tide of fortune,\r\nprospering with our cards, and with the still greater matrimonial game\r\nwhich we were playing; and we were quite unaware of the mine under our\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBefore a month was passed, the Jew began to pester Magny. He presented\r\nhimself at X--, and asked for further interest-hush-money; otherwise\r\nhe must sell the emerald. Magny got money for him; the Princess again\r\nbefriended her dastardly lover. The success of the first demand only\r\nrendered the second more exorbitant. I know not how much money was\r\nextorted and paid on this unluckly emerald: but it was the cause of the\r\nruin of us all.\r\n\r\nOne night we were keeping our table as usual at the Countess of\r\nLiliengarten\xe2\x80\x99s, and Magny being in cash somehow, kept drawing out\r\nrouleau after rouleau, and playing with his common ill success. In\r\nthe middle of the play a note was brought into him, which he read, and\r\nturned very pale on perusing; but the luck was against him, and looking\r\nup rather anxiously at the clock, he waited for a few more turns of the\r\ncards, when having, I suppose, lost his last rouleau, he got up with a\r\nwild oath that scared some of the polite company assembled, and left\r\nthe room. A great trampling of horses was heard without; but we were\r\ntoo much engaged with our business to heed the noise, and continued our\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nPresently some one came into the play-room and said to the Countess,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is a strange story! A Jew has been murdered in the Kaiserwald.\r\nMagny was arrested when he went out of the room.\xe2\x80\x99 All the party broke\r\nup on hearing this strange news, and we shut up our bank for the night.\r\nMagny had been sitting by me during the play (my uncle dealt and I paid\r\nand took the money), and, looking under the chair, there was a crumpled\r\npaper, which I took up and read. It was that which had been delivered to\r\nhim, and ran thus:--\xe2\x80\x98If you have done it, take the orderly\xe2\x80\x99s horse who\r\nbrings this. It is the best of my stable. There are a hundred louis in\r\neach holster, and the pistols are loaded. Either course lies open to\r\nyou if you know what I mean. In a quarter of an hour I shall know our\r\nfate--whether I am to be dishonoured and survive you, whether you are\r\nguilty and a coward, or whether you are still worthy of the name of\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was in the handwriting of the old General de Magny; and my uncle\r\nand I, as we walked home at night, having made and divided with the\r\nCountess Liliengarten no inconsiderable profits that night, felt our\r\ntriumphs greatly dashed by the perusal of the letter. \xe2\x80\x98Has Magny,\xe2\x80\x99 we\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x98robbed the Jew, or has his intrigue been discovered?\xe2\x80\x99 In either\r\ncase, my claims on the Countess Ida were likely to meet with serious\r\ndrawbacks: and I began to feel that my \xe2\x80\x98great card\xe2\x80\x99 was played and\r\nperhaps lost.\r\n\r\nWell, it WAS lost: though I say, to this day, it was well and gallantly\r\nplayed. After supper (which we never for fear of consequences took\r\nduring play) I became so agitated in my mind as to what was occurring\r\nthat I determined to sally out about midnight into the town, and inquire\r\nwhat was the real motive of Magny\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension. A sentry was at the\r\ndoor, and signified to me that I and my uncle were under arrest.\r\n\r\nWe were left in our quarters for six weeks, so closely watched that\r\nescape was impossible, had we desired it; but, as innocent men, we had\r\nnothing to fear. Our course of life was open to all, and we desired and\r\ncourted inquiry. Great and tragical events happened during those six\r\nweeks; of which, though we heard the outline, as all Europe did, when we\r\nwere released from our captivity, we were yet far from understanding all\r\nthe particulars, which were not much known to me for many years after.\r\nHere they are, as they were told me by the lady, who of all the world\r\nperhaps was most likely to know them. But the narrative had best form\r\nthe contents of another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. TRAGICAL HISTORY OF PRINCESS OF X----\r\n\r\nMore than twenty years after the events described in the past chapters,\r\nI was walking with my Lady Lyndon in the Rotunda at Ranelagh. It was in\r\nthe year 1790; the emigration from France had already commenced, the\r\nold counts and marquises were thronging to our shores: not starving and\r\nmiserable, as one saw them a few years afterwards, but unmolested as\r\nyet, and bringing with them some token of their national splendour.\r\nI was walking with Lady Lyndon, who, proverbially jealous and always\r\nanxious to annoy me, spied out a foreign lady who was evidently\r\nremarking me, and of course asked who was the hideous fat Dutchwoman who\r\nwas leering at me so? I knew her not in the least. I felt I had seen the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s face somewhere (it was now, as my wife said, enormously fat and\r\nbloated); but I did not recognise in the bearer of that face one who had\r\nbeen among the most beautiful women in Germany in her day.\r\n\r\nIt was no other than Madame de Liliengarten, the mistress, or as some\r\nsaid the morganatic wife, of the old Duke of X----, Duke Victor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather. She had left X----a few months after the elder Duke\xe2\x80\x99s demise,\r\nhad gone to Paris, as I heard, where some unprincipled adventurer\r\nhad married her for her money; but, however, had always retained her\r\nquasi-royal title, and pretended, amidst the great laughter of the\r\nParisians who frequented her house, to the honours and ceremonial of a\r\nsovereign\xe2\x80\x99s widow. She had a throne erected in her state-room, and was\r\nstyled by her servants and those who wished to pay court to her,\r\nor borrow money from her, \xe2\x80\x98Altesse.\xe2\x80\x99 Report said she drank rather\r\ncopiously--certainly her face bore every mark of that habit, and\r\nhad lost the rosy, frank, good-humoured beauty which had charmed the\r\nsovereign who had ennobled her.\r\n\r\nAlthough she did not address me in the circle at Ranelagh, I was at this\r\nperiod as well known as the Prince of Wales, and she had no difficulty\r\nin finding my house in Berkeley Square; whither a note was next morning\r\ndespatched to me. \xe2\x80\x98An old friend of Monsieur de Balibari,\xe2\x80\x99 it stated\r\n(in extremely bad French), \xe2\x80\x98is anxious to see the Chevalier again and\r\nto talk over old happy times. Rosina de Liliengarten (can it be that\r\nRedmond Balibari has forgotten her?) will be at her house in Leicester\r\nFields all the morning, looking for one who would never have passed her\r\nby TWENTY YEARS ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRosina of Liliengarten it was indeed--such a full-blown Rosina I have\r\nseldom seen. I found her in a decent first-floor in Leicester Fields\r\n(the poor soul fell much lower afterwards) drinking tea, which had\r\nsomehow a very strong smell of brandy in it; and after salutations,\r\nwhich would be more tedious to recount than they were to perform, and\r\nafter further straggling conversation, she gave me briefly the\r\nfollowing narrative of the events in X----, which I may well entitle the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Tragedy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remember Monsieur de Geldern, the Police Minister. He was of Dutch\r\nextraction, and, what is more, of a family of Dutch Jews. Although\r\neverybody was aware of this blot in his scutcheon, he was mortally angry\r\nif ever his origin was suspected; and made up for his fathers\xe2\x80\x99 errors\r\nby outrageous professions of religion, and the most austere practices\r\nof devotion. He visited church every morning, confessed once a week, and\r\nhated Jews and Protestants as much as an inquisitor could do. He never\r\nlost an opportunity of proving his sincerity, by persecuting one or the\r\nother whenever occasion fell in his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He hated the Princess mortally; for her Highness in some whim had\r\ninsulted him with his origin, caused pork to be removed from before him\r\nat table, or injured him in some such silly way; and he had a violent\r\nanimosity to the old Baron de Magny, both in his capacity of Protestant,\r\nand because the latter in some haughty mood had publicly turned his back\r\nupon him as a sharper and a spy. Perpetual quarrels were taking place\r\nbetween them in council; where it was only the presence of his\r\naugust masters that restrained the Baron from publicly and frequently\r\nexpressing the contempt which he felt for the officer of police.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thus Geldern had hatred as one reason for ruining the Princess, and it\r\nis my belief he had a stronger motive still--interest. You remember whom\r\nthe Duke married, after the death of his first wife?--a princess of the\r\nhouse of F----. Geldern built his fine palace two years after, and, as I\r\nfeel convinced, with the money which was paid to him by the F----family\r\nfor forwarding the match.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To go to Prince Victor, and report to his Highness a case which\r\neverybody knew, was not by any means Geldern\xe2\x80\x99s desire. He knew the man\r\nwould be ruined for ever in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s estimation who carried him\r\nintelligence so disastrous. His aim, therefore, was to leave the matter\r\nto explain itself to his Highness; and, when the time was ripe, he cast\r\nabout for a means of carrying his point. He had spies in the houses of\r\nthe elder and younger Magny; but this you know, of course, from your\r\nexperience of Continental customs. We had all spies over each other.\r\nYour black (Zamor, I think, was his name) used to give me reports every\r\nmorning; and I used to entertain the dear old Duke with stories of you\r\nand your uncle practising picquet and dice in the morning, and with your\r\nquarrels and intrigues. We levied similar contributions on everybody\r\nin X----, to amuse the dear old man. Monsieur de Magny\xe2\x80\x99s valet used to\r\nreport both to me and Monsieur de Geldern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew of the fact of the emerald being in pawn; and it was out of my\r\nexchequer that the poor Princess drew the funds which were spent upon\r\nthe odious Lowe, and the still more worthless young Chevalier. How the\r\nPrincess could trust the latter as she persisted in doing, is beyond my\r\ncomprehension; but there is no infatuation like that of a woman in\r\nlove: and you will remark, my dear Monsieur de Balibari, that our sex\r\ngenerally fix upon a bad man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not always, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 I interposed; \xe2\x80\x98your humble servant has created many\r\nsuch attachments.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not see that that affects the truth of the proposition,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe old lady drily, and continued her narrative. \xe2\x80\x98The Jew who held the\r\nemerald had had many dealings with the Princess, and at last was offered\r\na bribe of such magnitude, that he determined to give up the pledge. He\r\ncommitted the inconceivable imprudence of bringing the emerald with him\r\nto X----, and waited on Magny, who was provided by the Princess with\r\nmoney to redeem the pledge, and was actually ready to pay it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Their interview took place in Magny\xe2\x80\x99s own apartments, when his valet\r\noverheard every word of their conversation. The young man, who was\r\nalways utterly careless of money when it was in his possession, was\r\nso easy in offering it, that Lowe rose in his demands, and had the\r\nconscience to ask double the sum for which he had previously stipulated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At this the Chevalier lost all patience, fell on the wretch and was for\r\nkilling him; when the opportune valet rushed in and saved him. The man\r\nhad heard every word of the conversation between the disputants, and\r\nthe Jew ran flying with terror into his arms; and Magny, a quick and\r\npassionate, but not a violent man, bade the servant lead the villain\r\ndownstairs, and thought no more of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps he was not sorry to be rid of him, and to have in his\r\npossession a large sum of money, four thousand ducats, with which he\r\ncould tempt fortune once more; as you know he did at your table that\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your ladyship went halves, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98and you know how little I\r\nwas the better for my winnings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man conducted the trembling Israelite out of the palace, and no\r\nsooner had seen him lodged at the house of one of his brethren, where\r\nhe was accustomed to put up, than he went away to the office of his\r\nExcellency the Minister of Police, and narrated every word of the\r\nconversation which had taken place between the Jew and his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Geldern expressed the greatest satisfaction at his spy\xe2\x80\x99s prudence and\r\nfidelity. He gave him a purse of twenty ducats, and promised to provide\r\nfor him handsomely: as great men do sometimes promise to reward their\r\ninstruments; but you, Monsieur de Balibari, know how seldom those\r\npromises are kept. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, go and find out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monsieur de Geldern,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cat what time the Israelite proposes to return home again, or whether he\r\nwill repent and take the money.\xe2\x80\x9d The man went on this errand. Meanwhile,\r\nto make matters sure, Geldern arranged a play-party at my house,\r\ninviting you thither with your bank, as you may remember; and finding\r\nmeans, at the same time, to let Maxime de Magny know that there was\r\nto be faro at Madame de Liliengarten\xe2\x80\x99s. It was an invitation the poor\r\nfellow never neglected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI remembered the facts, and listened on, amazed at the artifice of the\r\ninfernal Minister of Police.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The spy came back from his message to Lowe, and stated that he had made\r\ninquiries among the servants of the house where the Heidelberg banker\r\nlodged, and that it was the latter\xe2\x80\x99s intention to leave X----that\r\nafternoon. He travelled by himself, riding an old horse, exceedingly\r\nhumbly attired, after the manner of his people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cJohann,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Minister, clapping the pleased spy upon the\r\nshoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cI am more and more pleased with you. I have been thinking,\r\nsince you left me, of your intelligence, and the faithful manner in\r\nwhich you have served me; and shall soon find an occasion to place you\r\naccording to your merits. Which way does this Israelitish scoundrel\r\ntake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe goes to R----to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must pass by the Kaiserwald. Are you a man of courage, Johann\r\nKerner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWill your Excellency try me?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, his eyes glittering: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nserved through the Seven Years\xe2\x80\x99 War, and was never known to fail there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNow, listen. The emerald must be taken from that Jew: in the very\r\nkeeping it the scoundrel has committed high treason. To the man who\r\nbrings me that emerald I swear I will give five hundred louis. You\r\nunderstand why it is necessary that it should be restored to her\r\nHighness. I need say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it to-night, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course your\r\nExcellency will hold me harmless in case of accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPsha!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Minister; \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay you half the money\r\nbeforehand; such is my confidence in you. Accident\xe2\x80\x99s impossible if you\r\ntake your measures properly. There are four leagues of wood; the Jew\r\nrides slowly. It will be night before he can reach, let us say, the\r\nold Powder-Mill in the wood. What\xe2\x80\x99s to prevent you from putting a\r\nrope across the road, and dealing with him there? Be back with me\r\nthis evening at supper. If you meet any of the patrol, say \xe2\x80\x98foxes are\r\nloose,\xe2\x80\x99--that\xe2\x80\x99s the word for to-night. They will let you pass them\r\nwithout questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man went off quite charmed with his commission; and when Magny was\r\nlosing his money at our faro-table, his servant waylaid the Jew at the\r\nspot named the Powder-Mill, in the Kaiserwald. The Jew\xe2\x80\x99s horse stumbled\r\nover a rope which had been placed across the road; and, as the rider\r\nfell groaning to the ground, Johann Kerner rushed out on him, masked,\r\nand pistol in hand, and demanded his money. He had no wish to kill the\r\nJew, I believe, unless his resistance should render extreme measures\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor did he commit any such murder; for, as the yelling Jew roared for\r\nmercy, and his assailant menaced him with a pistol, a squad of patrol\r\ncame up, and laid hold of the robber and the wounded man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kerner swore an oath. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have come too soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the sergeant\r\nof the police. \xe2\x80\x9cFOXES ARE LOOSE.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSome are caught,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant,\r\nquite unconcerned; and bound the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s hands with the rope which he\r\nhad stretched across the road to entrap the Jew. He was placed behind\r\na policeman on a horse; Lowe was similarly accommodated, and the\r\nparty thus came back into the town as the night fell. \xe2\x80\x98They were taken\r\nforthwith to the police quarter; and, as the chief happened to be there,\r\nthey were examined by his Excellency in person. Both were rigorously\r\nsearched; the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s papers and cases taken from him: the jewel was\r\nfound in a private pocket. As for the spy, the Minister, looking at him\r\nangrily, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is the servant of the Chevalier de Magny, one\r\nof her Highness\xe2\x80\x99s equerries!\xe2\x80\x9d and without hearing a word in exculpation\r\nfrom the poor frightened wretch, ordered him into close confinement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Calling for his horse, he then rode to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s apartments at the\r\npalace, and asked for an instant audience. When admitted, he produced\r\nthe emerald. \xe2\x80\x9cThis jewel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chas been found on the person of a\r\nHeidelberg Jew, who has been here repeatedly of late, and has had many\r\ndealings with her Highness\xe2\x80\x99s equerry, the Chevalier de Magny. This\r\nafternoon the Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s servant came from his master\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings,\r\naccompanied by the Hebrew; was heard to make inquiries as to the route\r\nthe man intended to take on his way homewards; followed him, or preceded\r\nhim rather, and was found in the act of rifling his victim by my police\r\nin the Kaiserwald. The man will confess nothing; but, on being searched,\r\na large sum in gold was found on his person; and though it is with the\r\nutmost pain that I can bring myself to entertain such an opinion, and to\r\nimplicate a gentleman of the character and name of Monsieur de Magny,\r\nI do submit that our duty is to have the Chevalier examined relative to\r\nthe affair. As Monsieur de Magny is in her Highness\xe2\x80\x99s private service,\r\nand in her confidence I have heard, I would not venture to apprehend him\r\nwithout your Highness\xe2\x80\x99s permission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Master of the Horse, a friend of the old Baron de\r\nMagny, who was present at the interview, no sooner heard the strange\r\nintelligence than he hastened away to the old general with the dreadful\r\nnews of his grandson\xe2\x80\x99s supposed crime. Perhaps his Highness himself\r\nwas not unwilling that his old friend and tutor in arms should have the\r\nchance of saving his family from disgrace; at all events, Monsieur de\r\nHengst, the Master of the Horse, was permitted to go off to the Baron\r\nundisturbed, and break to him the intelligence of the accusation pending\r\nover the unfortunate Chevalier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is possible that he expected some such dreadful catastrophe, for,\r\nafter hearing Hengst\xe2\x80\x99s narrative (as the latter afterwards told me), he\r\nonly said, \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d for some time refused to stir a\r\nstep in the matter, and then only by the solicitation of his friend\r\nwas induced to write the letter which Maxime de Magny received at our\r\nplay-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whilst he was there, squandering the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s money, a police visit\r\nwas paid to his apartments, and a hundred proofs, not of his guilt with\r\nrespect to the robbery, but of his guilty connection with the Princess,\r\nwere discovered there,--tokens of her giving, passionate letters\r\nfrom her, copies of his own correspondence to his young friends at\r\nParis,--all of which the Police Minister perused, and carefully put\r\ntogether under seal for his Highness, Prince Victor. I have no doubt he\r\nperused them, for, on delivering them to the Hereditary Prince, Geldern\r\nsaid that, IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS HIGHNESS\xe2\x80\x99S ORDERS, he had collected\r\nthe Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s papers; but he need not say that, on his honour, he\r\n(Geldern) himself had never examined the documents. His difference with\r\nMessieurs de Magny was known; he begged his Highness to employ any other\r\nofficial person in the judgment of the accusation brought against the\r\nyoung Chevalier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All these things were going on while the Chevalier was at play. A run\r\nof luck--you had great luck in those days, Monsieur de Balibari--was\r\nagainst him. He stayed and lost his 4000 ducats. He received his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnote, and such was the infatuation of the wretched gambler, that, on\r\nreceipt of it, he went down to the courtyard, where the horse was in\r\nwaiting, absolutely took the money which the poor old gentleman had\r\nplaced in the saddle-holsters, brought it upstairs, played it, and lost\r\nit; and when he issued from the room to fly, it was too late: he\r\nwas placed in arrest at the bottom of my staircase, as you were upon\r\nentering your own home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even when he came in under the charge of the soldiery sent to arrest\r\nhim, the old General, who was waiting, was overjoyed to see him, and\r\nflung himself into the lad\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and embraced him: it was said,\r\nfor the first time in many years. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is here, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he sobbed\r\nout,--\xe2\x80\x9cthank God he is not guilty of the robbery!\xe2\x80\x9d and then sank back in\r\na chair in a burst of emotion; painful, it was said by those present,\r\nto witness on the part of a man so brave, and known to be so cold and\r\nstern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cRobbery!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI swear before Heaven I am guilty of\r\nnone!\xe2\x80\x9d and a scene of almost touching reconciliation passed between\r\nthem, before the unhappy young man was led from the guard-house into the\r\nprison which he was destined never to quit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That night the Duke looked over the papers which Geldern had brought to\r\nhim. It was at a very early stage of the perusal, no doubt, that he gave\r\norders for your arrest; for you were taken at midnight, Magny at ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock; after which time the old Baron de Magny had seen his Highness,\r\nprotesting of his grandson\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, and the Prince had received him\r\nmost graciously and kindly. His Highness said he had no doubt the\r\nyoung man was innocent; his birth and his blood rendered such a crime\r\nimpossible; but suspicion was too strong against him: he was known to\r\nhave been that day closeted with the Jew; to have received a very large\r\nsum of money which he squandered at play, and of which the Hebrew had,\r\ndoubtless, been the lender,--to have despatched his servant after him,\r\nwho inquired the hour of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s departure, lay in wait for him, and\r\nrifled him. Suspicion was so strong against the Chevalier, that common\r\njustice required his arrest; and, meanwhile, until he cleared himself,\r\nhe should be kept in not dishonourable durance, and every regard had\r\nfor his name, and the services of his honourable grandfather. With\r\nthis assurance, and with a warm grasp of the hand, the Prince left old\r\nGeneral de Magny that night; and the veteran retired to rest almost\r\nconsoled, and confident in Maxime\xe2\x80\x99s eventual and immediate release.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But in the morning, before daybreak, the Prince, who had been reading\r\npapers all night, wildly called to the page, who slept in the next\r\nroom across the door, bade him get horses, which were always kept in\r\nreadiness in the stables, and, flinging a parcel of letters into a\r\nbox, told the page to follow him on horseback with these. The young man\r\n(Monsieur de Weissenborn) told this to a young lady who was then of my\r\nhousehold, and who is now Madame de Weissenborn, and a mother of a score\r\nof children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The page described that never was such a change seen as in his august\r\nmaster in the course of that single night. His eyes were bloodshot, his\r\nface livid, his clothes were hanging loose about him, and he who\r\nhad always made his appearance on parade as precisely dressed as any\r\nsergeant of his troops, might have been seen galloping through the\r\nlonely streets at early dawn without a hat, his unpowdered hair\r\nstreaming behind him like a madman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The page, with the box of papers, clattered after his master,--it was\r\nno easy task to follow him; and they rode from the palace to the town,\r\nand through it to the General\xe2\x80\x99s quarter. The sentinels at the door were\r\nscared at the strange figure that rushed up to the General\xe2\x80\x99s gate, and,\r\nnot knowing him, crossed bayonets, and refused him admission. \xe2\x80\x9cFools,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Weissenborn, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the Prince!\xe2\x80\x9d And, jangling at the bell as if\r\nfor an alarm of fire, the door was at length opened by the porter, and\r\nhis Highness ran up to the Generals bedchamber, followed by the page\r\nwith the box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMagny--Magny,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the Prince, thundering at the closed door, \xe2\x80\x9cget\r\nup!\xe2\x80\x9d And to the queries of the old man from within, answered, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nI--Victor--the Prince!--get up!\xe2\x80\x9d And presently the door was opened by\r\nthe General in his ROBE-DE-CHAMBRE, and the Prince entered. The page\r\nbrought in the box, and was bidden to wait without, which he did; but\r\nthere led from Monsieur de Magny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom into his antechamber two\r\ndoors, the great one which formed the entrance into his room, and a\r\nsmaller one which led, as the fashion is with our houses abroad, into\r\nthe closet which communicates with the alcove where the bed is. The door\r\nof this was found by M. de Weissenborn to be open, and the young man\r\nwas thus enabled to hear and see everything which occurred within the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The General, somewhat nervously, asked what was the reason of so early\r\na visit from his Highness; to which the Prince did not for a while\r\nreply, farther than by staring at him rather wildly, and pacing up and\r\ndown the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the cause!\xe2\x80\x9d dashing his fist on the box; and,\r\nas he had forgotten to bring the key with him, he went to the door for a\r\nmoment, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWeissenborn perhaps has it;\xe2\x80\x9d but seeing over the stove\r\none of the General\xe2\x80\x99s couteaux de chasse, he took it down, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d and fell to work to burst the red trunk open with the\r\nblade of the forest knife. The point broke, and he gave an oath, but\r\ncontinued haggling on with the broken blade, which was better suited\r\nto his purpose than the long pointed knife, and finally succeeded in\r\nwrenching open the lid of the chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the matter;--read\r\nthat!--here\xe2\x80\x99s more matter, read that!--here\xe2\x80\x99s more--no, not that; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomebody else\xe2\x80\x99s picture--but here\xe2\x80\x99s hers! Do you know that, Magny? My\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s--the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s! Why did you and your cursed race ever come out\r\nof France, to plant your infernal wickedness wherever your feet fell,\r\nand to ruin honest German homes? What have you and yours ever had from\r\nmy family but confidence and kindness? We gave you a home when you\r\nhad none, and here\xe2\x80\x99s our reward!\xe2\x80\x9d and he flung a parcel of papers down\r\nbefore the old General; who saw the truth at once;--he had known it long\r\nbefore, probably, and sank down on his chair, covering his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Prince went on gesticulating, and shrieking almost. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a man\r\ninjured you so, Magny, before you begot the father of that gambling\r\nlying villain yonder, you would have known how to revenge yourself. You\r\nwould have killed him! Yes, would have killed him. But who\xe2\x80\x99s to help\r\nme to my revenge? I\xe2\x80\x99ve no equal. I can\xe2\x80\x99t meet that dog of a\r\nFrenchman,--that pimp from Versailles,--and kill him, as if he had\r\nplayed the traitor to one of his own degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe blood of Maxime de Magny,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cis as\r\ngood as that of any prince in Christendom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCan I take it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Prince; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t have the\r\nprivilege of any other gentleman in Europe. What am I to do? Look here,\r\nMagny: I was wild when I came here; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nserved me for thirty years; you\xe2\x80\x99ve saved my life twice: they are all\r\nknaves and harlots about my poor old father here--no honest men or\r\nwomen--you are the only one--you saved my life; tell me what am I to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d Thus from insulting Monsieur de Magny, the poor distracted Prince\r\nfell to supplicating him; and, at last, fairly flung himself down, and\r\nburst out in an agony of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Magny, one of the most rigid and cold of men on common occasions,\r\nwhen he saw this outbreak of passion on the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s part, became, as my\r\ninformant has described to me, as much affected as his master. The\r\nold man from being cold and high, suddenly fell, as it were, into\r\nthe whimpering querulousness of extreme old age. He lost all sense of\r\ndignity; he went down on his knees, and broke out into all sorts of wild\r\nincoherent attempts at consolation; so much so, that Weissenborn said he\r\ncould not bear to look at the scene, and actually turned away from the\r\ncontemplation of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, from what followed in a few days, we may guess the results of the\r\nlong interview. The Prince, when he came away from the conversation with\r\nhis old servant, forgot his fatal box of papers and sent the page back\r\nfor them. The General was on his knees praying in the room when the\r\nyoung man entered, and only stirred and looked wildly round as the other\r\nremoved the packet. The Prince rode away to his hunting-lodge at three\r\nleagues from X----, and three days after that Maxime de Magny died in\r\nprison; having made a confession that he was engaged in an attempt to\r\nrob the Jew, and that he had made away with himself, ashamed of his\r\ndishonour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it is not known that it was the General himself who took his\r\ngrandson poison: it was said even that he shot him in the prison. This,\r\nhowever, was not the case. General de Magny carried his grandson the\r\ndraught which was to carry him out of the world; represented to the\r\nwretched youth that his fate was inevitable; that it would be public and\r\ndisgraceful unless he chose to anticipate the punishment, and so left\r\nhim. But IT WAS NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD, and not until he had used EVERY\r\nmeans of escape, as you shall hear, that the unfortunate being\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nwas brought to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for General de Magny, he quite fell into imbecility a short time\r\nafter his grandson\xe2\x80\x99s death, and my honoured Duke\xe2\x80\x99s demise. After his\r\nHighness the Prince married the Princess Mary of F----, as they were\r\nwalking in the English park together they once met old Magny riding in\r\nthe sun in the easy chair, in which he was carried commonly abroad\r\nafter his paralytic fits. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my wife, Magny,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince\r\naffectionately, taking the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s hand; and he added, turning to his\r\nPrincess, \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral de Magny saved my life during the Seven Years\xe2\x80\x99 War.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken her back again?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsend me back my poor Maxime.\xe2\x80\x9d He had quite forgotten the death of the\r\npoor Princess Olivia, and the Prince, looking very dark indeed, passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Madame de Liliengarten, \xe2\x80\x98I have only one more gloomy\r\nstory to relate to you--the death of the Princess Olivia. It is even\r\nmore horrible than the tale I have just told you.\xe2\x80\x99 With which preface\r\nthe old lady resumed her narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The kind weak Princess\xe2\x80\x99s fate was hastened, if not occasioned, by the\r\ncowardice of Magny. He found means to communicate with her from his\r\nprison, and her Highness, who was not in open disgrace yet (for the\r\nDuke, out of regard to the family, persisted in charging Magny with only\r\nrobbery), made the most desperate efforts to relieve him, and to bribe\r\nthe gaolers to effect his escape. She was so wild that she lost all\r\npatience and prudence in the conduct of any schemes she may have had\r\nfor Magny\xe2\x80\x99s liberation; for her husband was inexorable, and caused the\r\nChevalier\xe2\x80\x99s prison to be too strictly guarded for escape to be possible.\r\nShe offered the State jewels in pawn to the Court banker; who of course\r\nwas obliged to decline the transaction. She fell down on her knees, it\r\nis said, to Geldern, the Police Minister, and offered him Heaven knows\r\nwhat as a bribe. Finally, she came screaming to my poor dear Duke, who,\r\nwith his age, diseases, and easy habits, was quite unfit for scenes of\r\nso violent a nature; and who, in consequence of the excitement created\r\nin his august bosom by her frantic violence and grief, had a fit\r\nin which I very nigh lost him. That his dear life was brought to an\r\nuntimely end by these transactions I have not the slightest doubt; for\r\nthe Strasbourg pie, of which they said he died, never, I am sure,\r\ncould have injured him, but for the injury which his dear gentle heart\r\nreceived from the unusual occurrences in which he was forced to take a\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All her Highness\xe2\x80\x99s movements were carefully, though not ostensibly,\r\nwatched by her husband, Prince Victor; who, waiting upon his august\r\nfather, sternly signified to him that if his Highness (MY Duke) should\r\ndare to aid the Princess in her efforts to release Magny, he, Prince\r\nVictor, would publicly accuse the Princess and her paramour of high\r\ntreason, and take measures with the Diet for removing his father from\r\nthe throne, as incapacitated to reign. Hence interposition on our part\r\nwas vain, and Magny was left to his fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It came, as you are aware, very suddenly. Geldern, Police Minister,\r\nHengst, Master of the Horse, and the colonel of the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s guard,\r\nwaited upon the young man in his prison two days after his grandfather\r\nhad visited him there and left behind him the phial of poison which the\r\ncriminal had not the courage to use. And Geldern signified to the young\r\nman that unless he took of his own accord the laurelwater provided by\r\nthe elder Magny, more violent means of death would be instantly employed\r\nupon him, and that a file of grenadiers was in waiting in the\r\ncourtyard to despatch him. Seeing this, Magny, with the most dreadful\r\nself-abasement, after dragging himself round the room on his knees\r\nfrom one officer to another, weeping and screaming with terror, at last\r\ndesperately drank off the potion, and was a corpse in a few minutes.\r\nThus ended this wretched young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His death was made public in the COURT GAZETTE two days after, the\r\nparagraph stating that Monsieur de M----, struck with remorse for having\r\nattempted the murder of the Jew, had put himself to death by poison in\r\nprison; and a warning was added to all young noblemen of the duchy to\r\navoid the dreadful sin of gambling, which had been the cause of the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s ruin, and had brought upon the grey hairs of one of the\r\nnoblest and most honourable of the servants of the Duke irretrievable\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The funeral was conducted with decent privacy, the General de Magny\r\nattending it. The carriages of the two Dukes and all the first people\r\nof the Court made their calls upon the General afterwards. He attended\r\nparade as usual the next day on the Arsenal-Place, and Duke Victor, who\r\nhad been inspecting the building, came out of it leaning on the brave\r\nold warrior\xe2\x80\x99s arm. He was particularly gracious to the old man, and\r\ntold his officers the oft-repeated story how at Rosbach, when the\r\nX----contingent served with the troops of the unlucky Soubise, the\r\nGeneral had thrown himself in the way of a French dragoon, who was\r\npressing hard upon his Highness in the rout, had received the blow\r\nintended for his master, and killed the assailant. And he alluded to\r\nthe family motto of \xe2\x80\x9cMagny sans tache,\xe2\x80\x9d and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt had been always\r\nso with his gallant friend and tutor in arms.\xe2\x80\x9d This speech affected all\r\npresent very much; with the exception of the old General, who only bowed\r\nand did not speak: but when he went home he was heard muttering \xe2\x80\x9cMagny\r\nsans tache, Magny sans tache!\xe2\x80\x9d and was attacked with paralysis that\r\nnight, from which he never more than partially recovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The news of Maxime\xe2\x80\x99s death had somehow been kept from the Princess\r\nuntil now: a GAZETTE even being printed without the paragraph containing\r\nthe account of his suicide; but it was at length, I know not how, made\r\nknown to her. And when she heard it, her ladies tell me, she screamed\r\nand fell, as if struck dead; then sat up wildly and raved like a\r\nmadwoman, and was then carried to her bed, where her physician attended\r\nher, and where she lay of a brain-fever. All this while the Prince used\r\nto send to make inquiries concerning her; and from his giving orders\r\nthat his Castle of Schlangenfels should be prepared and furnished, I\r\nmake no doubt it was his intention to send her into confinement thither:\r\nas had been done with the unhappy sister of His Britannic Majesty at\r\nZell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She sent repeatedly to demand an interview with his Highness; which the\r\nlatter declined, saying that he would communicate with her Highness when\r\nher health was sufficiently recovered. To one of her passionate letters\r\nhe sent back for reply a packet, which, when opened, was found to\r\ncontain the emerald that had been the cause round which all this dark\r\nintrigue moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her Highness at this time became quite frantic; vowed in the presence\r\nof all her ladies that one lock of her darling Maxime\xe2\x80\x99s hair was more\r\nprecious to her than all the jewels in the world: rang for her carriage,\r\nand said she would go and kiss his tomb; proclaimed the murdered\r\nmartyr\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, and called down the punishment of Heaven, the wrath\r\nof her family, upon his assassin. The Prince, on hearing these speeches\r\n(they were all, of course, regularly brought to him), is said to have\r\ngiven one of his dreadful looks (which I remember now), and to have\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThis cannot last much longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All that day and the next the Princess Olivia passed in dictating\r\nthe most passionate letters to the Prince her father, to the Kings of\r\nFrance, Naples, and Spain, her kinsmen, and to all other branches of her\r\nfamily, calling upon them in the most incoherent terms to protect her\r\nagainst the butcher and assassin her husband, assailing his person in\r\nthe maddest terms of reproach, and at the same time confessing her\r\nlove for the murdered Magny. It was in vain that those ladies who were\r\nfaithful to her pointed out to her the inutility of these letters, the\r\ndangerous folly of the confessions which they made; she insisted\r\nupon writing them, and used to give them to her second robe-woman, a\r\nFrenchwoman (her Highness always affectioned persons of that nation),\r\nwho had the key of her cassette, and carried every one of these epistles\r\nto Geldern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With the exception that no public receptions were held, the ceremony of\r\nthe Princess\xe2\x80\x99s establishment went on as before. Her ladies were allowed\r\nto wait upon her and perform their usual duties about her person.\r\nThe only men admitted were, however, her servants, her physician and\r\nchaplain; and one day when she wished to go into the garden, a heyduc,\r\nwho kept the door, intimated to her Highness that the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s orders\r\nwere that she should keep her apartments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They abut, as you remember, upon the landing of the marble staircase\r\nof Schloss X----; the entrance to Prince Victor\xe2\x80\x99s suite of rooms being\r\nopposite the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s on the same landing. This space is large, filled\r\nwith sofas and benches, and the gentlemen and officers who waited upon\r\nthe Duke used to make a sort of antechamber of the landing-place, and\r\npay their court to his Highness there, as he passed out, at eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, to parade. At such a time, the heyducs within the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuite of rooms used to turn out with their halberts and present to\r\nPrince Victor--the same ceremony being performed on his own side, when\r\npages came out and announced the approach of his Highness. The pages\r\nused to come out and say, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d and the drums beat in\r\nthe hall, and the gentlemen rose, who were waiting on the benches that\r\nran along the balustrade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if fate impelled her to her death, one day the Princess, as her\r\nguards turned out, and she was aware that the Prince was standing, as\r\nwas his wont, on the landing, conversing with his gentlemen (in the\r\nold days he used to cross to the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s apartment and kiss her\r\nhand)--the Princess, who had been anxious all the morning, complaining\r\nof heat, insisting that all the doors of the apartments should be left\r\nopen; and giving tokens of an insanity which I think was now evident,\r\nrushed wildly at the doors when the guards passed out, flung them open,\r\nand before a word could be said, or her ladies could follow her, was\r\nin presence of Duke Victor, who was talking as usual on the landing:\r\nplacing herself between him and the stair, she began apostrophising him\r\nwith frantic vehemence:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTake notice, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed out, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this man is a\r\nmurderer and a liar; that he lays plots for honourable gentlemen, and\r\nkills them in prison! Take notice, that I too am in prison, and fear the\r\nsame fate: the same butcher who killed Maxime de Magny, may, any night,\r\nput the knife to my throat. I appeal to you, and to all the kings of\r\nEurope, my Royal kinsmen. I demand to be set free from this tyrant\r\nand villain, this liar and traitor! I adjure you all, as gentlemen of\r\nhonour, to carry these letters to my relatives, and say from whom you\r\nhad them!\xe2\x80\x9d and with this the unhappy lady began scattering letters about\r\namong the astonished crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLET NO MAN STOOP!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Prince, in a voice of thunder. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de\r\nGleim, you should have watched your patient better. Call the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphysicians: her Highness\xe2\x80\x99s brain is affected. Gentlemen, have the\r\ngoodness to retire.\xe2\x80\x9d And the Prince stood on the landing as the\r\ngentlemen went down the stairs, saying fiercely to the guard, \xe2\x80\x9cSoldier,\r\nif she moves, strike with your halbert!\xe2\x80\x9d on which the man brought the\r\npoint of his weapon to the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s breast; and the lady, frightened,\r\nshrank back and re-entered her apartments. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Monsieur de\r\nWeissenborn,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cpick up all those papers;\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nPrince went into his own apartments, preceded by his pages, and never\r\nquitted them until he had seen every one of the papers burnt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The next day the COURT GAZETTE contained a bulletin signed by the three\r\nphysicians, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cher Highness the Hereditary Princess laboured\r\nunder inflammation of the brain, and had passed a restless and disturbed\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d Similar notices were issued day after day. The services of all\r\nher ladies, except two, were dispensed with. Guards were placed within\r\nand without her doors; her windows were secured, so that escape from\r\nthem was impossible: and you know what took place ten days after. The\r\nchurch-bells were ringing all night, and the prayers of the faithful\r\nasked for a person IN EXTREMIS. A GAZETTE appeared in the morning, edged\r\nwith black, and stating that the high and mighty Princess Olivia\r\nMaria Ferdinanda, consort of His Serene Highness Victor Louis Emanuel,\r\nHereditary Prince of X----, had died in the evening of the 24th of\r\nJanuary 1769.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But do you know HOW she died, sir? That, too, is a mystery.\r\nWeissenborn, the page, was concerned in this dark tragedy; and the\r\nsecret was so dreadful, that never, believe me, till Prince Victor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, did I reveal it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After the fatal ESCLANDRE which the Princess had made, the Prince\r\nsent for Weissenborn, and binding him by the most solemn adjuration to\r\nsecrecy (he only broke it to his wife many years after: indeed, there is\r\nno secret in the world that women cannot know if they will), despatched\r\nhim on the following mysterious commission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThere lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Highness, \xe2\x80\x9con the Kehl side of the river,\r\nopposite to Strasbourg, a man whose residence you will easily find\r\nout from his name, which is MONSIEUR DE STRASBOURG. You will make your\r\ninquiries concerning him quietly, and without occasioning any remark;\r\nperhaps you had better go into Strasbourg for the purpose, where the\r\nperson is quite well known. You will take with you any comrade on whom\r\nyou can perfectly rely: the lives of both, remember, depend on your\r\nsecrecy. You will find out some period when MONSIEUR DE STRASBOURG is\r\nalone, or only in company of the domestic who lives with him (I myself\r\nvisited the man by accident on my return from Paris five years since,\r\nand hence am induced to send for him now, in my present emergency). You\r\nwill have your carriage waiting at his door at night; and you and your\r\ncomrade will enter his house masked; and present him with a purse of\r\na hundred louis; promising him double that sum on his return from his\r\nexpedition. If he refuse, you must use force and bring him; menacing him\r\nwith instant death should he decline to follow you. You will place him\r\nin the carriage with the blinds drawn, one or other of you never\r\nlosing sight of him the whole way, and threatening him with death if he\r\ndiscover himself or cry out. You will lodge him in the old Tower here,\r\nwhere a room shall be prepared for him; and his work being done, you\r\nwill restore him to his home with the same speed and secrecy with which\r\nyou brought him from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such were the mysterious orders Prince Victor gave his page; and\r\nWeissenborn, selecting for his comrade in the expedition Lieutenant\r\nBartenstein, set out on his strange journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All this while the palace was hushed, as if in mourning, the bulletins\r\nin the COURT GAZETTE appeared, announcing the continuance of the\r\nPrincess\xe2\x80\x99s malady; and though she had but few attendants, strange\r\nand circumstantial stories were told regarding the progress of her\r\ncomplaint. She was quite wild. She had tried to kill herself. She\r\nhad fancied herself to be I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many different characters.\r\nExpresses were sent to her family informing them of her state, and\r\ncouriers despatched PUBLICLY to Vienna and Paris to procure the\r\nattendance of physicians skilled in treating diseases of the brain.\r\nThat pretended anxiety was all a feint: it was never intended that the\r\nPrincess should recover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The day on which Weissenborn and Bartenstein returned from their\r\nexpedition, it was announced that her Highness the Princess was much\r\nworse; that night the report through the town was that she was at the\r\nagony: and that night the unfortunate creature was endeavouring to make\r\nher escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She had unlimited confidence in the French chamber-woman who attended\r\nher, and between her and this woman the plan of escape was arranged. The\r\nPrincess took her jewels in a casket; a private door, opening from\r\none of her rooms and leading into the outer gate, it was said, of\r\nthe palace, was discovered for her: and a letter was brought to her,\r\npurporting to be from the Duke, her father-in-law, and stating that a\r\ncarriage and horses had been provided, and would take her to B----: the\r\nterritory where she might communicate with her family and be safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The unhappy lady, confiding in her guardian, set out on the expedition.\r\nThe passages wound through the walls of the modern part of the palace\r\nand abutted in effect at the old Owl Tower, as it was called, on the\r\nouter wall: the tower was pulled down afterwards, and for good reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At a certain place the candle, which the chamberwoman was carrying,\r\nwent out; and the Princess would have screamed with terror, but her hand\r\nwas seized, and a voice cried \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d The next minute a man in a\r\nmask (it was the Duke himself) rushed forward, gagged her with a\r\nhandkerchief, her hands and legs were bound, and she was carried\r\nswooning with terror into a vaulted room, where she was placed by a\r\nperson there waiting, and tied in an arm-chair. The same mask who had\r\ngagged her, came and bared her neck and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt had best be done now\r\nshe has fainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps it would have been as well; for though she recovered from her\r\nswoon, and her confessor, who was present, came forward and endeavoured\r\nto prepare her for the awful deed which was about to be done upon her,\r\nand for the state into which she was about to enter, when she came to\r\nherself it was only to scream like a maniac, to curse the Duke as a\r\nbutcher and tyrant, and to call upon Magny, her dear Magny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At this the Duke said, quite calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cMay God have mercy on her sinful\r\nsoul!\xe2\x80\x9d He, the confessor, and Geldern, who were present, went down on\r\ntheir knees; and, as his Highness dropped his handkerchief, Weissenborn\r\nfell down in a fainting fit; while MONSIEUR DE STRASBOURG, taking the\r\nback hair in his hand, separated the shrieking head of Olivia from the\r\nmiserable sinful body. May Heaven have mercy upon her soul!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThis was the story told by Madame de Liliengarten, and the reader will\r\nhave no difficulty in drawing from it that part which affected myself\r\nand my uncle; who, after six weeks of arrest, were set at liberty, but\r\nwith orders to quit the duchy immediately: indeed, with an escort of\r\ndragoons to conduct us to the frontier. What property we had, we were\r\nallowed to sell and realise in money; but none of our play debts were\r\npaid to us: and all my hopes of the Countess Ida were thus at an end.\r\n\r\nWhen Duke Victor came to the throne, which he did when, six months\r\nafter, apoplexy carried off the old sovereign his father, all the good\r\nold usages of X----were given up,--play forbidden; the opera and ballet\r\nsent to the right-about; and the regiments which the old Duke had\r\nsold recalled from their foreign service: with them came my Countess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeggarly cousin the ensign, and he married her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether\r\nthey were happy or not. It is certain that a woman of such a poor spirit\r\ndid not merit any very high degree of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe now reigning Duke of X----himself married four years after his first\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s demise, and Geldern, though no longer Police Minister, built the\r\ngrand house of which Madame de Liliengarten spoke. What became of\r\nthe minor actors in the great tragedy, who knows? Only MONSIEUR DE\r\nSTRASBOURG was restored to his duties. Of the rest--the Jew, the\r\nchamber-woman, the spy on Magny--I know nothing. Those sharp tools with\r\nwhich great people cut out their enterprises are generally broken in the\r\nusing: nor did I ever hear that their employers had much regard for them\r\nin their ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. I CONTINUE MY CAREER AS A MAN OF FASHION\r\n\r\nI find I have already filled up many scores of pages, and yet a vast\r\ndeal of the most interesting portion of my history remains to be told,\r\nviz. that which describes my sojourn in the kingdoms of England and\r\nIreland, and the great part I played there; moving among the most\r\nillustrious of the land, myself not the least distinguished of the\r\nbrilliant circle. In order to give due justice to this portion of my\r\nMemoirs, then,--which is more important than my foreign adventures can\r\nbe (though I could fill volumes with interesting descriptions of the\r\nlatter),--I shall cut short the account of my travels in Europe, and of\r\nmy success at the Continental Courts, in order to speak of what befell\r\nme at home. Suffice it to say that there is not a capital in Europe,\r\nexcept the beggarly one of Berlin, where the young Chevalier de Balibari\r\nwas not known and admired; and where he has not made the brave, the\r\nhigh-born, and the beautiful talk of him. I won 80,000 roubles from\r\nPotemkin at the Winter Palace at Petersburg, which the scoundrelly\r\nfavourite never paid me; I have had the honour of seeing his Royal\r\nHighness the Chevalier Charles Edward as drunk as any porter at Rome;\r\nmy uncle played several matches at billiards against the celebrated Lord\r\nC----at Spa, and I promise you did not come off a loser. In fact, by a\r\nneat stratagem of ours, we raised the laugh against his Lordship, and\r\nsomething a great deal more substantial. My Lord did not know that the\r\nChevalier Barry had a useless eye; and when, one day, my uncle playfully\r\nbet him odds at billiards that he would play him with a patch over\r\none eye, the noble lord, thinking to bite us (he was one of the most\r\ndesperate gamblers that ever lived), accepted the bet, and we won a very\r\nconsiderable amount of him.\r\n\r\nNor need I mention my successes among the fairer portion of the\r\ncreation. One of the most accomplished, the tallest, the most athletic,\r\nand the handsomest gentlemen of Europe, as I was then, a young fellow\r\nof my figure could not fail of having advantages, which a person of my\r\nspirit knew very well how to use. But upon these subjects I am dumb.\r\nCharming Schuvaloff, black-eyed Sczotarska, dark Valdez, tender\r\nHegenheim, brilliant Langeac!--ye gentle hearts that knew how to beat in\r\nold times for the warm young Irish gentleman, where are you now? Though\r\nmy hair has grown grey now, and my sight dim, and my heart cold with\r\nyears, and ennui, and disappointment, and the treachery of friends,\r\nyet I have but to lean back in my arm-chair and think, and those sweet\r\nfigures come rising up before me out of the past, with their smiles, and\r\ntheir kindnesses, and their bright tender eyes! There are no women like\r\nthem now--no manners like theirs! Look you at a bevy of women at the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s, stitched up in tight white satin sacks, with their waists\r\nunder their arms, and compare them to the graceful figures of the old\r\ntime! Why, when I danced with Coralie de Langeac at the fetes on the\r\nbirth of the first Dauphin at Versailles, her hoop was eighteen feet\r\nin circumference, and the heels of her lovely little mules were three\r\ninches from the ground; the lace of my jabot was worth a thousand\r\ncrowns, and the buttons of my amaranth velvet coat alone cost eighty\r\nthousand livres. Look at the difference now! The gentlemen are dressed\r\nlike boxers, Quakers, or hackney-coachmen; and the ladies are not\r\ndressed at all. There is no elegance, no refinement; none of the\r\nchivalry of the old world, of which I form a portion. Think of the\r\nfashion of London being led by a Br-mm-l! [Footnote: This manuscript\r\nmust have been written at the time when Mr. Brummel was the leader of\r\nthe London fashion.] a nobody\xe2\x80\x99s son: a low creature, who can no more\r\ndance a minuet than I can talk Cherokee; who cannot even crack a bottle\r\nlike a gentleman; who never showed himself to be a man with his sword in\r\nhis hand: as we used to approve ourselves in the good old times, before\r\nthat vulgar Corsican upset the gentry of the world! Oh, to see the\r\nValdez once again, as on that day I met her first driving in state,\r\nwith her eight mules and her retinue of gentlemen, by the side of yellow\r\nMancanares! Oh, for another drive with Hegenheim, in the gilded sledge,\r\nover the Saxon snow! False as Schuvaloff was, \xe2\x80\x98twas better to be jilted\r\nby her than to be adored by any other woman. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any one\r\nof them without tenderness. I have ringlets of all their hair in my poor\r\nlittle museum of recollections. Do you keep mine, you dear souls that\r\nsurvive the turmoils and troubles of near half a hundred years? How\r\nchanged its colour is now, since the day Sczotarska wore it round her\r\nneck, after my duel with Count Bjernaski, at Warsaw.\r\n\r\nI never kept any beggarly books of accounts in those days. I had no\r\ndebts. I paid royally for everything I took; and I took everything\r\nI wanted. My income must have been very large. My entertainments and\r\nequipages were those of a gentleman of the highest distinction; nor let\r\nany scoundrel presume to sneer because I carried off and married my Lady\r\nLyndon (as you shall presently hear), and call me an adventurer, or say\r\nI was penniless, or the match unequal. Penniless! I had the wealth\r\nof Europe at my command. Adventurer! So is a meritorious lawyer or\r\na gallant soldier; so is every man who makes his own fortune an\r\nadventurer. My profession was play: in which I was then unrivalled. No\r\nman could play with me through Europe, on the square; and my income was\r\njust as certain (during health and the exercise of my profession) as\r\nthat of a man who draws on his Three-per-cents., or any fat squire whose\r\nacres bring him revenue. Harvest is not more certain than the effect of\r\nskill is: a crop is a chance, as much as a game of cards greatly played\r\nby a fine player: there may be a drought, or a frost, or a hail-storm,\r\nand your stake is lost; but one man is just as much an adventurer as\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn evoking the recollection of these kind and fair creatures I have\r\nnothing but pleasure. I would I could say as much of the memory of\r\nanother lady, who will henceforth play a considerable part in the drama\r\nof my life,--I mean the Countess of Lyndon; whose fatal acquaintance I\r\nmade at Spa, very soon after the events described in the last chapter\r\nhad caused me to quit Germany.\r\n\r\nHonoria, Countess of Lyndon, Viscountess Bullingdon in England, Baroness\r\nCastle Lyndon of the kingdom of Ireland, was so well known to the great\r\nworld in her day, that I have little need to enter into her family\r\nhistory; which is to be had in any peerage that the reader may lay\r\nhis hand on. She was, as I need not say, a countess, viscountess, and\r\nbaroness in her own right. Her estates in Devon and Cornwall were\r\namong the most extensive in those parts; her Irish possessions not less\r\nmagnificent; and they have been alluded to, in a very early part of\r\nthese Memoirs, as lying near to my own paternal property in the kingdom\r\nof Ireland: indeed, unjust confiscations in the time of Elizabeth and\r\nher father went to diminish my acres, while they added to the already\r\nvast possessions of the Lyndon family.\r\n\r\nThe Countess, when I first saw her at the assembly at Spa, was the wife\r\nof her cousin, the Right Honourable Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon, Knight\r\nof the Bath, and Minister to George II. and George III. at several of\r\nthe smaller Courts of Europe. Sir Charles Lyndon was celebrated as a wit\r\nand bon vivant: he could write love-verses against Hanbury Williams, and\r\nmake jokes with George Selwyn; he was a man of vertu like Harry Walpole,\r\nwith whom and Mr. Grey he had made a part of the grand tour; and was\r\ncited, in a word, as one of the most elegant and accomplished men of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI made this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance as usual at the play-table, of\r\nwhich he was a constant frequenter. Indeed, one could not but admire the\r\nspirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favourite pastime; for,\r\nthough worn out by gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled\r\nabout in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him\r\nevery morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green\r\ncloth: and if, as it would often happen, his own hands were too feeble\r\nor inflamed to hold the box, he would call the mains, nevertheless,\r\nand have his valet or a friend to throw for him. I like this courageous\r\nspirit in a man; the greatest successes in life have been won by such\r\nindomitable perseverance.\r\n\r\nI was by this time one of the best-known characters in Europe; and the\r\nfame of my exploits, my duels, my courage at play, would bring crowds\r\naround me in any public society where I appeared. I could show reams of\r\nscented paper, to prove that this eagerness to make my acquaintance was\r\nnot confined to the gentlemen only; but that I hate boasting, and\r\nonly talk of myself in so far as it is necessary to relate myself\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadventures: the most singular of any man\xe2\x80\x99s in Europe. Well, Sir Charles\r\nLyndon\xe2\x80\x99s first acquaintance with me originated in the right honourable\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s winning 700 pieces of me at picquet (for which he was almost my\r\nmatch); and I lost them with much good-humour, and paid them: and paid\r\nthem, you may be sure, punctually. Indeed, I will say this for myself,\r\nthat losing money at play never in the least put me out of good-humour\r\nwith the winner, and that wherever I found a superior, I was always\r\nready to acknowledge and hail him.\r\n\r\nLyndon was very proud of winning from so celebrated a person, and we\r\ncontracted a kind of intimacy; which, however, did not for a while go\r\nbeyond pump-room attentions, and conversations over the supper-table at\r\nplay: but which gradually increased, until I was admitted into his more\r\nprivate friendship. He was a very free-spoken man (the gentry of those\r\ndays were much prouder than at present), and used to say to me in his\r\nhaughty easy way, \xe2\x80\x98Hang it, Mr. Barry, you have no more manners than a\r\nbarber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you;\r\nbut you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you,\r\nsir, because you seem determined to go to the deuce by a way of your\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x99 I would thank him laughingly for this compliment, and say, that\r\nas he was bound to the next world much sooner than I was, I would be\r\nobliged to him to get comfortable quarters arranged there for me. He\r\nused also to be immensely amused with my stories about the splendour of\r\nmy family and the magnificence of Castle Brady: he would never tire of\r\nlistening or laughing at those histories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stick to the trumps, however, my lad,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say, when I told him of\r\nmy misfortunes in the conjugal line, and how near I had been winning the\r\ngreatest fortune in Germany. \xe2\x80\x98Do anything but marry, my artless Irish\r\nrustic\xe2\x80\x99 (he called me by a multiplicity of queer names). \xe2\x80\x98Cultivate your\r\ngreat talents in the gambling line; but mind this, that a woman will\r\nbeat you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat I denied; mentioning several instances in which I had conquered the\r\nmost intractable tempers among the sex.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They will beat you in the long run, my Tipperary Alcibiades. As soon\r\nas you are married, take my word of it, you are conquered. Look at me. I\r\nmarried my cousin, the noblest and greatest heiress in England--married\r\nher in spite of herself almost\xe2\x80\x99 (here a dark shade passed over Sir\r\nCharles Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s countenance). \xe2\x80\x98She is a weak woman. You shall see her,\r\nsir, HOW weak she is; but she is my mistress. She has embittered my\r\nwhole life. She is a fool; but she has got the better of one of the best\r\nheads in Christendom. She is enormously rich; but somehow I have never\r\nbeen so poor as since I married her. I thought to better myself; and\r\nshe has made me miserable and killed me. And she will do as much for my\r\nsuccessor, when I am gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has her Ladyship a very large income?\xe2\x80\x99 said I. At which Sir Charles\r\nburst out into a yelling laugh, and made me blush not a little at my\r\ngaucherie; for the fact is, seeing him in the condition in which he was,\r\nI could not help speculating upon the chance a man of spirit might have\r\nwith his widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98Waugh hawk, Mr. Barry; don\xe2\x80\x99t think, if\r\nyou value your peace of mind, to stand in my shoes when they are vacant.\r\nBesides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my Lady Lyndon would QUITE condescend to marry\r\na\xe2\x80\x99----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marry a what, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, in a rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what: but the man who gets her will rue it, take my word\r\non\xe2\x80\x99t. A plague on her! had it not been for my father\xe2\x80\x99s ambition and mine\r\n(he was her uncle and guardian, and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let such a prize out of\r\nthe family), I might have died peaceably, at least; carried my gout down\r\nto my grave in quiet, lived in my modest tenement in Mayfair, had every\r\nhouse in England open to me; and now, now I have six of my own, and\r\nevery one of them is a hell to me. Beware of greatness, Mr. Barry. Take\r\nwarning by me. Ever since I have been married and have been rich, I have\r\nbeen the most miserable wretch in the world. Look at me. I am dying a\r\nworn-out cripple at the age of fifty. Marriage has added forty years to\r\nmy life. When I took off Lady Lyndon, there was no man of my years\r\nwho looked so young as myself. Fool that I was! I had enough with my\r\npensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe; and I gave up\r\nall these, and married, and was miserable. Take a warning by me, Captain\r\nBarry, and stick to the trumps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough my intimacy with the knight was considerable, for a long time I\r\nnever penetrated into any other apartments of his hotel but those which\r\nhe himself occupied. His lady lived entirely apart from him; and it\r\nis only curious how they came to travel together at all. She was a\r\ngoddaughter of old Mary Wortley Montagu: and, like that famous old woman\r\nof the last century, made considerable pretensions to be a blue-stocking\r\nand a bel esprit. Lady Lyndon wrote poems in English and Italian, which\r\nstill may be read by the curious in the pages of the magazines of the\r\nday. She entertained a correspondence with several of the European\r\nsavans upon history, science, and ancient languages, and especially\r\ntheology. Her pleasure was to dispute controversial points with abbes\r\nand bishops; and her flatterers said she rivalled Madam Dacier in\r\nlearning. Every adventurer who had a discovery in chemistry, a new\r\nantique bust, or a plan for discovering the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s stone, was\r\nsure to find a patroness in her. She had numberless works dedicated to\r\nher, and sonnets without end addressed to her by all the poetasters of\r\nEurope, under the name of Lindonira or Calista. Her rooms were crowded\r\nwith hideous China magots, and all sorts of objects of VERTU.\r\n\r\nNo woman piqued herself more upon her principles, or allowed love to be\r\nmade to her more profusely. There was a habit of courtship practised\r\nby the fine gentlemen of those days, which is little understood in our\r\ncoarse downright times: and young and old fellows would pour out floods\r\nof compliments in letters and madrigals, such as would make a sober lady\r\nstare were they addressed to her nowadays: so entirely has the gallantry\r\nof the last century disappeared out of our manners.\r\n\r\nLady Lyndon moved about with a little court of her own. She had\r\nhalf-a-dozen carriages in her progresses. In her own she would travel\r\nwith her companion (some shabby lady of quality), her birds, and\r\npoodles, and the favourite savant for the time being. In another would\r\nbe her female secretary and her waiting-women; who, in spite of their\r\ncare, never could make their mistress look much better than a slattern.\r\nSir Charles Lyndon had his own chariot, and the domestics of the\r\nestablishment would follow in other vehicles.\r\n\r\nAlso must be mentioned the carriage in which rode her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchaplain, Mr. Runt, who acted in capacity of governor to her son, the\r\nlittle Viscount Bullingdon,--a melancholy deserted little boy, about\r\nwhom his father was more than indifferent, and whom his mother never\r\nsaw, except for two minutes at her levee, when she would put to him a\r\nfew questions of history or Latin grammar; after which he was consigned\r\nto his own amusements, or the care of his governor, for the rest of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe notion of such a Minerva as this, whom I saw in the public places\r\nnow and then, surrounded by swarms of needy abbes and schoolmasters,\r\nwho flattered her, frightened me for some time, and I had not the\r\nleast desire to make her acquaintance. I had no desire to be one of the\r\nbeggarly adorers in the great lady\xe2\x80\x99s train,--fellows, half friend, half\r\nlacquey, who made verses, and wrote letters, and ran errands, content to\r\nbe paid by a seat in her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s box at the comedy, or a cover at her\r\ndinner-table at noon. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 Sir Charles Lyndon would\r\nsay, whose great subject of conversation and abuse was his lady: \xe2\x80\x98my\r\nLindonira will have nothing to do with you. She likes the Tuscan brogue,\r\nnot that of Kerry. She says you smell too much of the stable to be\r\nadmitted to ladies\xe2\x80\x99 society; and last Sunday fortnight, when she did me\r\nthe honour to speak to me last, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, Sir Charles Lyndon,\r\na gentleman who has been the King\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador can demean himself by\r\ngambling and boozing with low Irish blacklegs!\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t fly in a fury! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na cripple, and it was Lindonira said it, not I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis piqued me, and I resolved to become acquainted with Lady Lyndon;\r\nif it were but to show her Ladyship that the descendant of those Barrys,\r\nwhose property she unjustly held, was not an unworthy companion for any\r\nlady, were she ever so high. Besides, my friend the knight was dying:\r\nhis widow would be the richest prize in the three kingdoms. Why should I\r\nnot win her, and, with her, the means of making in the world that figure\r\nwhich my genius and inclination desired? I felt I was equal in blood\r\nand breeding to any Lyndon in Christendom, and determined to bend this\r\nhaughty lady. When I determine, I look upon the thing as done.\r\n\r\nMy uncle and I talked the matter over, and speedily settled upon a\r\nmethod for making our approaches upon this stately lady of Castle\r\nLyndon. Mr. Runt, young Lord Bullingdon\xe2\x80\x99s governor, was fond of\r\npleasure, of a glass of Rhenish in the garden-houses in the summer\r\nevenings, and of a sly throw of the dice when the occasion offered; and\r\nI took care to make friends with this person, who, being a college tutor\r\nand an Englishman, was ready to go on his knees to any one who resembled\r\na man of fashion. Seeing me with my retinue of servants, my vis-a-vis\r\nand chariots, my valets, my hussar, and horses, dressed in gold, and\r\nvelvet, and sables, saluting the greatest people in Europe as we met\r\non the course, or at the Spas, Runt was dazzled by my advances, and\r\nwas mine by a beckoning of the finger. I shall never forget the poor\r\nwretch\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment when I asked him to dine, with two counts, off\r\ngold plate, at the little room in the casino: he was made happy by\r\nbeing allowed to win a few pieces of us, became exceedingly tipsy, sang\r\nCambridge songs, and recreated the company by telling us, in his horrid\r\nYorkshire French, stories about the gyps, and all the lords that had\r\never been in his college. I encouraged him to come and see me oftener,\r\nand bring with him his little viscount; for whom, though the boy always\r\ndetested me, I took care to have a good stock of sweetmeats, toys, and\r\npicture-books when he came.\r\n\r\nI then began to enter into a controversy with Mr. Runt, and confided to\r\nhim some doubts which I had, and a very very earnest leaning towards the\r\nChurch of Rome. I made a certain abbe whom I knew write me letters upon\r\ntransubstantiation, &c., which the honest tutor was rather puzzled to\r\nanswer. I knew that they would be communicated to his lady, as they\r\nwere; for, asking leave to attend the English service which was\r\ncelebrated in her apartments, and frequented by the best English then\r\nat the Spa, on the second Sunday she condescended to look at me; on the\r\nthird she was pleased to reply to my profound bow by a curtsey; the next\r\nday I followed up the acquaintance by another obeisance in the public\r\nwalk; and, to make a long story short, her Ladyship and I were in full\r\ncorrespondence on transubstantiation before six weeks were over. My Lady\r\ncame to the aid of her chaplain; and then I began to see the prodigious\r\nweight of his arguments: as was to be expected. The progress of this\r\nharmless little intrigue need not be detailed. I make no doubt every one\r\nof my readers has practised similar stratagems when a fair lady was in\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the astonishment of Sir Charles Lyndon when, on\r\none summer evening, as he was issuing out to the play-table in his\r\nsedan-chair, according to his wont, her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s barouche and four,\r\nwith her outriders in the tawny livery of the Lyndon family, came\r\ndriving into the courtyard of the house which they inhabited; and in\r\nthat carriage, by her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s side, sat no other than the \xe2\x80\x98vulgar\r\nIrish adventurer,\xe2\x80\x99 as she was pleased to call him: I mean Redmond Barry,\r\nEsquire. He made the most courtly of his bows, and grinned and waved his\r\nhat in as graceful a manner as the gout permitted; and her Ladyship and\r\nI replied to the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on\r\nour parts.\r\n\r\nI could not go to the play-table for some time afterwards for Lady\r\nLyndon and I had an argument on transubstantiation, which lasted for\r\nthree hours; in which she was, as usual, victorious, and, in which her\r\ncompanion, the Honourable Miss Flint Skinner, fell asleep; but when, at\r\nlast, I joined Sir Charles at the casino, he received me with a yell of\r\nlaughter, as his wont was, and introduced me to all the company as Lady\r\nLyndon\xe2\x80\x99s interesting young convert. This was his way. He laughed and\r\nsneered at everything. He laughed when he was in a paroxysm of pain; he\r\nlaughed when he won money, or when he lost it: his laugh was not jovial\r\nor agreeable, but rather painful and sardonic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to Punter, Colonel Loder, Count du Carreau, and\r\nseveral jovial fellows with whom he used to discuss a flask of champagne\r\nand a Rhenish trout or two after play, \xe2\x80\x98see this amiable youth! He has\r\nbeen troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my\r\nchaplain, Mr. Runt, who has asked for advice from my wife, Lady Lyndon;\r\nand, between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in\r\nhis faith. Did you ever hear of such doctors, and such a disciple?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98if I want to learn good principles, it\xe2\x80\x99s surely\r\nbetter I should apply for them to your lady and your chaplain than to\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wants to step into my shoes!\xe2\x80\x99 continued the knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man would be happy who did so,\xe2\x80\x99 responded I, \xe2\x80\x98provided there were\r\nno chalk-stones included!\xe2\x80\x99 At which reply Sir Charles was not very well\r\npleased, and went on with increased rancour. He was always free-spoken\r\nin his cups; and, to say the truth, he was in his cups many more times\r\nin a week than his doctors allowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98for me, as I am drawing\r\nnear the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me,\r\nthat she is even now thinking of appointing a successor? (I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nyou precisely, Mr. Barry; you are only taking your chance with a score\r\nof others whom I could mention.) Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a comfort to see her, like\r\na prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, with\r\nperfect sincerity; for I liked him, as a most amusing companion. \xe2\x80\x98Not\r\nso soon, my dear, as you may fancy, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 continued he. \xe2\x80\x98Why, man,\r\nI have been given over any time these four years; and there was always a\r\ncandidate or two waiting to apply for the situation. Who knows how long\r\nI may keep you waiting?\xe2\x80\x99 and he DID keep me waiting some little time\r\nlonger than at that period there was any reason to suspect.\r\n\r\nAs I declared myself pretty openly, according to my usual way, and\r\nauthors are accustomed to describe the persons of the ladies with whom\r\ntheir heroes fall in love; in compliance with this fashion, I perhaps\r\nshould say a word or two respecting the charms of my Lady Lyndon. But\r\nthough I celebrated them in many copies of verses, of my own and other\r\npersons\xe2\x80\x99 writing; and though I filled reams of paper in the passionate\r\nstyle of those days with compliments to every one of her beauties and\r\nsmiles, in which I compared her to every flower, goddess, or famous\r\nheroine ever heard of,--truth compels me to say that there was nothing\r\ndivine about her at all. She was very well; but no more. Her shape was\r\nfine, her hair dark, her eyes good, and exceedingly active; she loved\r\nsinging, but performed it as so great a lady should, very much out of\r\ntune. She had a smattering of half-a-dozen modern languages, and, as I\r\nhave said before, of many more sciences than I even knew the names of.\r\nShe piqued herself on knowing Greek and Latin; but the truth is, that\r\nMr. Runt, used to supply her with the quotations which she introduced\r\ninto her voluminous correspondence. She had as much love of admiration,\r\nas strong, uneasy a vanity, and as little heart, as any woman I ever\r\nknew. Otherwise, when her son, Lord Bullingdon, on account of his\r\ndifferences with me, ran--but that matter shall be told in its proper\r\ntime. Finally, my Lady Lyndon was about a year older than myself;\r\nthough, of course, she would take her Bible oath that she was three\r\nyears younger.\r\n\r\nFew men are so honest as I am; for few will own to their real motives,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a button about confessing mine. What Sir Charles Lyndon\r\nsaid was perfectly true. I made the acquaintance of Lady Lyndon with\r\nulterior views. \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to him, when, after the scene described\r\nand the jokes he made upon me, we met alone, \xe2\x80\x98let those laugh that win.\r\nYou were very pleasant upon me a few nights since, and on my intentions\r\nregarding your lady. Well, if they ARE what you think they are,--if I DO\r\nwish to step into your shoes, what then? I have no other intentions than\r\nyou had yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sworn to muster just as much regard for my\r\nLady Lyndon as you ever showed her; and if I win her and wear her when\r\nyou are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think it will be the fear\r\nof your ghost will deter me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLyndon laughed as usual; but somewhat disconcertedly: indeed I had\r\nclearly the best of him in the argument, and had just as much right to\r\nhunt my fortune as he had.\r\n\r\nBut one day he said, \xe2\x80\x98If you marry such a woman as my Lady Lyndon, mark\r\nmy words, you will regret it. You will pine after the liberty you once\r\nenjoyed. By George! Captain Barry,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x98the thing\r\nthat I regret most in life--perhaps it is because I am old, blase, and\r\ndying--is, that I never had a virtuous attachment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha! a milkmaid\xe2\x80\x99s daughter!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, laughing at the absurdity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, why not a milkmaid\xe2\x80\x99s daughter? My good fellow, I WAS in love\r\nin youth, as most gentlemen are, with my tutor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Helena, a\r\nbouncing girl; of course older than myself\xe2\x80\x99 (this made me remember my\r\nown little love-passages with Nora Brady in the days of my early life),\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and do you know, sir, I heartily regret I didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry her? There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing like having a virtuous drudge at home, sir; depend upon that. It\r\ngives a zest to one\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyments in the world, take my word for it. No\r\nman of sense need restrict himself, or deny himself a single amusement\r\nfor his wife\xe2\x80\x99s sake: on the contrary, if he select the animal properly,\r\nhe will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a\r\ncomfort in his hours of annoyance. For instance, I have got the gout:\r\nwho tends me? A hired valet, who robs me whenever he has the power. My\r\nwife never comes near me. What friend have I? None in the wide world.\r\nMen of the world, as you and I are, don\xe2\x80\x99t make friends; and we are\r\nfools for our pains. Get a friend, sir, and that friend a woman--a\r\ngood household drudge, who loves you. THAT is the most precious sort of\r\nfriendship; for the expense of it is all on the woman\xe2\x80\x99s side. The man\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t contribute anything. If he\xe2\x80\x99s a rogue, she\xe2\x80\x99ll vow he\xe2\x80\x99s an angel;\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99s a brute, she will like him all the better for his ill-treatment\r\nof her. They like it, sir, these women. They are born to be our greatest\r\ncomforts and conveniences; our--our moral bootjacks, as it were; and to\r\nmen in your way of life, believe me such a person would be invaluable.\r\nI am only speaking for your bodily and mental comfort\xe2\x80\x99s sake, mind. Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t I marry poor Helena Flower, the curate\xe2\x80\x99s daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI thought these speeches the remarks of a weakly disappointed man;\r\nalthough since, perhaps, I have had reason to find the truth of Sir\r\nCharles Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s statements. The fact is, in my opinion, that we often\r\nbuy money very much too dear. To purchase a few thousands a year at the\r\nexpense of an odious wife, is very bad economy for a young fellow of any\r\ntalent and spirit; and there have been moments of my life when, in the\r\nmidst of my greatest splendour and opulence, with half-a-dozen lords at\r\nmy levee, with the finest horses in my stables, the grandest house over\r\nmy head, with unlimited credit at my banker\xe2\x80\x99s, and--Lady Lyndon to boot,\r\nI have wished myself back a private of Bulow\xe2\x80\x99s, or anything, so as to\r\nget rid of her. To return, however, to the story. Sir Charles, with his\r\ncomplication of ills, was dying before us by inches! and I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt\r\nit could not have been very pleasant to him to see a young handsome\r\nfellow paying court to his widow before his own face as it were. After\r\nI once got into the house on the transubstantiation dispute, I found a\r\ndozen more occasions to improve my intimacy, and was scarcely ever out\r\nof her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s doors. The world talked and blustered; but what cared\r\nI? The men cried fie upon the shameless Irish adventurer; but I have\r\ntold my way of silencing such envious people: and my sword had by this\r\ntime got such a reputation through Europe, that few people cared to\r\nencounter it. If I can once get my hold of a place, I keep it. Many\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe house I have been to where I have seen the men avoid me. \xe2\x80\x98Faugh! the\r\nlow Irishman,\xe2\x80\x99 they would say. \xe2\x80\x98Bah! the coarse adventurer!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Out on the\r\ninsufferable blackleg and puppy!\xe2\x80\x99 and so forth. This hatred has been\r\nof no inconsiderable service to me in the world; for when I fasten on a\r\nman, nothing can induce me to release my hold: and I am left to myself,\r\nwhich is all the better. As I told Lady Lyndon in those days, with\r\nperfect sincerity, \xe2\x80\x98Calista\xe2\x80\x99 (I used to call her Calista in my\r\ncorrespondence)--\xe2\x80\x99 Calista, I swear to thee, by the spotlessness of thy\r\nown soul, by the brilliancy of thy immitigable eyes, by everything pure\r\nand chaste in heaven and in thy own heart, that I will never cease\r\nfrom following thee! Scorn I can bear, and have borne at thy hands.\r\nIndifference I can surmount; \xe2\x80\x98tis a rock which my energy will climb\r\nover, a magnet which attracts the dauntless iron of my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 And it was\r\ntrue, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left her--no, though they had kicked me downstairs\r\nevery day I presented myself at her door.\r\n\r\nThat is my way of fascinating women. Let the man who has to make his\r\nfortune in life remember this maxim. ATTACKING is his only secret. Dare,\r\nand the world always yields: or, if it beat you sometimes, dare again,\r\nand it will succumb. In those days my spirit was so great, that if I\r\nhad set my heart upon marrying a princess of the blood, I would have had\r\nher!\r\n\r\nI told Calista my story, and altered very very little of the truth.\r\nMy object was to frighten her: to show her that what I wanted, that I\r\ndared; that what I dared, that I won; and there were striking passages\r\nenough in my history to convince her of my iron will and indomitable\r\ncourage. \xe2\x80\x98Never hope to escape me, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 I would say: \xe2\x80\x98offer to\r\nmarry another man, and he dies upon this sword, which never yet met its\r\nmaster. Fly from me, and I will follow you, though it were to the gates\r\nof Hades.\xe2\x80\x99 I promise you this was very different language to that she\r\nhad been in the habit of hearing from her Jemmy-Jessamy adorers. You\r\nshould have seen how I scared the fellows from her.\r\n\r\nWhen I said in this energetic way that I would follow Lady Lyndon across\r\nthe Styx if necessary, of course I meant that I would do so, provided\r\nnothing more suitable presented itself in the interim. If Lyndon would\r\nnot die, where was the use of my pursuing the Countess? And somehow,\r\ntowards the end of the Spa season, very much to my mortification I do\r\nconfess, the knight made another rally: it seemed as if nothing would\r\nkill him. \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry for you, Captain Barry,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say, laughing as\r\nusual. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m grieved to keep you, or any gentleman, waiting. Had you not\r\nbetter arrange with my doctor, or get the cook to flavour my omelette\r\nwith arsenic? What are the odds, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 he would add, \xe2\x80\x98that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlive to see Captain Barry hanged yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn fact, the doctors tinkered him up for a year. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my usual luck,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI could not help saying to my uncle, who was my confidential and most\r\nexcellent adviser in all matters of the heart. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wasting the\r\ntreasures of my affections upon that flirt of a countess, and here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nher husband restored to health and likely to live I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many\r\nyears!\xe2\x80\x99 And, as if to add to my mortification, there came just at this\r\nperiod to Spa an English tallow-chandler\xe2\x80\x99s heiress, with a plum to\r\nher fortune; and Madame Cornu, the widow of a Norman cattle-dealer and\r\nfarmer-general, with a dropsy and two hundred thousand livres a year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of my following the Lyndons to England,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98if the\r\nknight won\xe2\x80\x99t die?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t follow them, my dear simple child,\xe2\x80\x99 replied my uncle. \xe2\x80\x98Stop here\r\nand pay court to the new arrivals.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and lose Calista for ever, and the greatest estate in all\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh! youths like you easily fire and easily despond. Keep up a\r\ncorrespondence with Lady Lyndon. You know there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing she likes\r\nso much. There\xe2\x80\x99s the Irish abbe, who will write you the most charming\r\nletters for a crown apiece. Let her go; write to her, and meanwhile look\r\nout for anything else which may turn up. Who knows? you might marry the\r\nNorman widow, bury her, take her money, and be ready for the Countess\r\nagainst the knight\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd so, with vows of the most profound respectful attachment, and having\r\ngiven twenty louis to Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s waiting-woman for a lock of her\r\nhair (of which fact, of course, the woman informed her mistress), I took\r\nleave of the Countess, when it became necessary for her return to her\r\nestates in England; swearing I would follow her as soon as an affair of\r\nhonour I had on my hands could be brought to an end.\r\n\r\nI shall pass over the events of the year that ensued before I again\r\nsaw her. She wrote to me according to promise; with much regularity at\r\nfirst, with somewhat less frequency afterwards. My affairs, meanwhile,\r\nat the play-table went on not unprosperously, and I was just on the\r\npoint of marrying the widow Cornu (we were at Brussels by this time, and\r\nthe poor soul was madly in love with me,) when the London Gazette was\r\nput into my hands, and I read the following announcement:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Died at Castle-Lyndon, in the kingdom of Ireland, the Right Honourable\r\nSir Charles Lyndon, Knight of the Bath, member of Parliament for Lyndon\r\nin Devonshire, and many years His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s representative at various\r\nEuropean Courts. He hath left behind him a name which is endeared to all\r\nhis friends for his manifold virtues and talents, a reputation justly\r\nacquired in the service of His Majesty, and an inconsolable widow to\r\ndeplore his loss. Her Ladyship, the bereaved Countess of Lyndon, was\r\nat the Bath when the horrid intelligence reached her of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndemise, and hastened to Ireland immediately in order to pay her last sad\r\nduties to his beloved remains.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat very night I ordered my chariot and posted to Ostend, whence I\r\nfreighted a vessel to Dover, and travelling rapidly into the West,\r\nreached Bristol; from which port I embarked for Waterford, and found\r\nmyself, after an absence of eleven years, in my native country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. I RETURN TO IRELAND, AND EXHIBIT MY SPLENDOUR AND\r\nGENEROSITY IN THAT KINGDOM\r\n\r\nHow were times changed with me now! I had left my country a poor\r\npenniless boy--a private soldier in a miserable marching regiment.\r\nI returned an accomplished man, with property to the amount of five\r\nthousand guineas in my possession, with a splendid wardrobe and\r\njewel-case worth two thousand more; having mingled in all the scenes of\r\nlife a not undistinguished actor in them; having shared in war and in\r\nlove; having by my own genius and energy won my way from poverty and\r\nobscurity to competence and splendour. As I looked out from my chariot\r\nwindows as it rolled along over the bleak bare roads, by the miserable\r\ncabins of the peasantry, who came out in their rags to stare as the\r\nsplendid equipage passed, and huzza\xe2\x80\x99d for his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s honour as\r\nthey saw the magnificent stranger in the superb gilded vehicle, my\r\nhuge body-servant Fritz lolling behind with curling moustaches and\r\nlong queue, his green livery barred with silver lace, I could not help\r\nthinking of myself with considerable complacency, and thanking my stars\r\nthat had endowed me with so many good qualities. But for my own merits\r\nI should have been a raw Irish squireen such as those I saw swaggering\r\nabout the wretched towns through which my chariot passed on its road to\r\nDublin. I might have married Nora Brady (and though, thank Heaven, I\r\ndid not, I have never thought of that girl but with kindness, and even\r\nremember the bitterness of losing her more clearly at this moment than\r\nany other incident of my life); I might have been the father of ten\r\nchildren by this time, or a farmer on my own account, or an agent to\r\na squire, or a gauger, or an attorney; and here I was one of the most\r\nfamous gentlemen of Europe! I bade my fellow get a bag of copper money\r\nand throw it among the crowd as we changed horses; and I warrant me\r\nthere was as much shouting set up in praise of my honour as if my Lord\r\nTownshend, the Lord Lieutenant himself, had been passing.\r\n\r\nMy second day\xe2\x80\x99s journey--for the Irish roads were rough in those days,\r\nand the progress of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s chariot terribly slow--brought me to\r\nCarlow, where I put up at the very inn which I had used eleven years\r\nback, when flying from home after the supposed murder of Quin in the\r\nduel. How well I remember every moment of the scene! The old landlord\r\nwas gone who had served me; the inn that I then thought so comfortable\r\nlooked wretched and dismantled; but the claret was as good as in the old\r\ndays, and I had the host to partake of a jug of it and hear the news of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nHe was as communicative as hosts usually are: the crops and the markets,\r\nthe price of beasts at last Castle Dermot fair, the last story about the\r\nvicar, and the last joke of Father Hogan the priest; how the Whiteboys\r\nhad burned Squire Scanlan\xe2\x80\x99s ricks, and the highwaymen had been beaten\r\noff in their attack upon Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s house; who was to hunt the\r\nKilkenny hounds next season, and the wonderful run entirely they had\r\nlast March; what troops were in the town, and how Miss Biddy Toole\r\nhad run off with Ensign Mullins: all the news of sport, assize, and\r\nquarter-sessions were detailed by this worthy chronicler of small-beer,\r\nwho wondered that my honour hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of them in England, or in\r\nforeign parts, where he seemed to think the world was as interested\r\nas he was about the doings of Kilkenny and Carlow. I listened to these\r\ntales with, I own, a considerable pleasure; for every now and then a\r\nname would come up in the conversation which I remembered in old days,\r\nand bring with it a hundred associations connected with them.\r\n\r\nI had received many letters from my mother, which informed me of the\r\ndoings of the Brady\xe2\x80\x99s Town family. My uncle was dead, and Mick, his\r\neldest son, had followed him too to the grave. The Brady girls had\r\nseparated from their paternal roof as soon as their elder brother came\r\nto rule over it. Some were married, some gone to settle with their\r\nodious old mother in out-of-the-way watering-places. Ulick, though he\r\nhad succeeded to the estate, had come in for a bankrupt property, and\r\nCastle Brady was now inhabited only by the bats and owls, and the old\r\ngamekeeper. My mother, Mrs. Harry Barry, had gone to live at Bray, to\r\nsit under Mr. Jowls, her favourite preacher, who had a chapel there;\r\nand, finally, the landlord told me, that Mrs. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s son had gone to\r\nforeign parts, enlisted in the Prussian service, and had been shot there\r\nas a deserter.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to own that I hired a stout nag from the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s stable\r\nafter dinner, and rode back at nightfall twenty miles to my old home.\r\nMy heart beat to see it. Barryville had got a pestle and mortar over the\r\ndoor, and was called \xe2\x80\x98The Esculapian Repository,\xe2\x80\x99 by Doctor Macshane;\r\na red-headed lad was spreading a plaster in the old parlour; the little\r\nwindow of my room, once so neat and bright, was cracked in many places,\r\nand stuffed with rags here and there; the flowers had disappeared\r\nfrom the trim garden-beds which my good orderly mother tended. In the\r\nchurchyard there were two more names put into the stone over the family\r\nvault of the Bradys: they were those of my cousin, for whom my regard\r\nwas small, and my uncle, whom I had always loved. I asked my old\r\ncompanion the blacksmith, who had beaten me so often in old days, to\r\ngive my horse a feed and a litter: he was a worn weary-looking man now,\r\nwith a dozen dirty ragged children paddling about his smithy, and had no\r\nrecollection of the fine gentleman who stood before him. I did not\r\nseek to recall my-self to his memory till the next day, when I put ten\r\nguineas into his hand, and bade him drink the health of English Redmond.\r\n\r\nAs for Castle Brady, the gates of the park were still there; but the old\r\ntrees were cut down in the avenue, a black stump jutting out here and\r\nthere, and casting long shadows as I passed in the moonlight over\r\nthe worn grass-grown old road. A few cows were at pasture there. The\r\ngarden-gate was gone, and the place a tangled wilderness. I sat down on\r\nthe old bench, where I had sat on the day when Nora jilted me; and I do\r\nbelieve my feelings were as strong then as they had been when I was a\r\nboy, eleven years before; and I caught myself almost crying again, to\r\nthink that Nora Brady had deserted me. I believe a man forgets nothing.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a flower, or heard some trivial word or two, which have\r\nawakened recollections that somehow had lain dormant for scores of\r\nyears; and when I entered the house in Clarges Street, where I was born\r\n(it was used as a gambling-house when I first visited London), all of a\r\nsudden the memory of my childhood came back to me--of my actual infancy:\r\nI recollected my father in green and gold, holding me up to look at a\r\ngilt coach which stood at the door, and my mother in a flowered sack,\r\nwith patches on her face. Some day, I wonder, will everything we have\r\nseen and thought and done come and flash across our minds in this way?\r\nI had rather not. I felt so as I sat upon the bench at Castle Brady, and\r\nthought of the bygone times.\r\n\r\nThe hall-door was open--it was always so at that house; the moon was\r\nflaring in at the long old windows, and throwing ghastly chequers upon\r\nthe floors; and the stars were looking in on the other side, in the blue\r\nof the yawning window over the great stair: from it you could see the\r\nold stable-clock, with the letters glistening on it still. There had\r\nbeen jolly horses in those stables once; and I could see my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhonest face, and hear him talking to his dogs as they came jumping and\r\nwhining and barking round about him of a gay winter morning. We used to\r\nmount there; and the girls looked out at us from the hall-window, where\r\nI stood and looked at the sad, mouldy, lonely old place. There was a\r\nred light shining through the crevices of a door at one corner of the\r\nbuilding, and a dog presently came out baying loudly, and a limping man\r\nfollowed with a fowling-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98PHIL PURCELL, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x99 shouted I; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s Redmond Barry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI thought the old man would have fired his piece at me at first, for he\r\npointed it at the window; but I called to him to hold his hand, and came\r\ndown and embraced him.... Psha! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to tell the rest: Phil and\r\nI had a long night, and talked over a thousand foolish old things that\r\nhave no interest for any soul alive now: for what soul is there alive\r\nthat cares for Barry Lyndon?\r\n\r\nI settled a hundred guineas on the old man when I got to Dublin, and\r\nmade him an annuity which enabled him to pass his old days in comfort.\r\n\r\nPoor Phil Purcell was amusing himself at a game of exceedingly dirty\r\ncards with an old acquaintance of mine; no other than Tim, who was\r\ncalled my \xe2\x80\x98valet\xe2\x80\x99 in the days of yore, and whom the reader may remember\r\nas clad in my father\xe2\x80\x99s old liveries. They used to hang about him in\r\nthose times, and lap over his wrists and down to his heels; but Tim,\r\nthough he protested he had nigh killed himself with grief when I went\r\naway, had managed to grow enormously fat in my absence, and would have\r\nfitted almost into Daniel Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s coat, or that of the vicar of Castle\r\nBrady, whom he served in the capacity of clerk. I would have engaged\r\nthe fellow in my service but for his monstrous size, which rendered him\r\nquite unfit to be the attendant of any gentleman of condition; and so I\r\npresented him with a handsome gratuity, and promised to stand godfather\r\nto his next child: the eleventh since my absence. There is no country in\r\nthe world where the work of multiplying is carried on so prosperously\r\nas in my native island. Mr. Tim had married the girls\xe2\x80\x99 waiting-maid,\r\nwho had been a kind friend of mine in the early times; and I had to go\r\nsalute poor Molly next day, and found her a slatternly wench in a mud\r\nhut, surrounded by a brood of children almost as ragged as those of my\r\nfriend the blacksmith.\r\n\r\nFrom Tim and Phil Purcell, thus met fortuitously together, I got the\r\nvery last news respecting my family. My mother was well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says Tim, \xe2\x80\x98and you\xe2\x80\x99re come in time, mayhap, for preventing\r\nan addition to your family.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed I, in a fit of indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the shape of father-in-law, I mane, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says Tim: \xe2\x80\x98the misthress\r\nis going to take on with Mister Jowls the praacher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Nora, he added, had made many additions to the illustrious race of\r\nQuin; and my cousin Ulick was in Dublin, coming to little good, both my\r\ninformants feared, and having managed to run through the small available\r\nremains of property which my good old uncle had left behind him.\r\n\r\nI saw I should have no small family to provide for; and then, to\r\nconclude the evening, Phil, Tim, and I, had a bottle of usquebaugh, the\r\ntaste of which I had remembered for eleven good years, and did not part\r\nexcept with the warmest terms of fellowship, and until the sun had been\r\nsome time in the sky. I am exceedingly affable; that has always been\r\none of my characteristics. I have no false pride, as many men of high\r\nlineage like my own have, and, in default of better company, will hob\r\nand nob with a ploughboy or a private soldier just as readily as with\r\nthe first noble in the land.\r\n\r\nI went back to the village in the morning, and found a pretext for\r\nvisiting Barryville under a device of purchasing drugs. The hooks were\r\nstill in the wall where my silver-hiked sword used to hang; a blister\r\nwas lying on the window-sill, where my mother\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Whole Duty of Man\xe2\x80\x99 had\r\nits place; and the odious Doctor Macshane had found out who I was (my\r\ncountrymen find out everything, and a great deal more besides), and\r\nsniggering, asked me how I left the King of Prussia, and whether my\r\nfriend the Emperor Joseph was as much liked as the Empress Maria Theresa\r\nhad been. The bell-ringers would have had a ring of bells for me, but\r\nthere was but one, Tim, who was too fat to pull; and I rode off before\r\nthe vicar, Doctor Bolter (who had succeeded old Mr. Texter, who had\r\nthe living in my time), had time to come out to compliment me; but the\r\nrapscallions of the beggarly village had assembled in a dirty army to\r\nwelcome me, and cheered \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah for Masther Redmond!\xe2\x80\x99 as I rode away.\r\n\r\nMy people were not a little anxious regarding me, by the time I returned\r\nto Carlow, and the landlord was very much afraid, he said, that the\r\nhighwaymen had gotten hold of me. There, too, my name and station had\r\nbeen learned from my servant Fritz: who had not spared his praises of\r\nhis master, and had invented some magnificent histories concerning me.\r\nHe said it was the truth that I was intimate with half the sovereigns of\r\nEurope, and the prime favourite with most of them. Indeed I had made\r\nmy uncle\xe2\x80\x99s order of the Spur hereditary, and travelled under\r\nthe name of the Chevalier Barry, chamberlain to the Duke of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\r\n\r\nThey gave me the best horses the stable possessed to carry me on my road\r\nto Dublin, and the strongest ropes for harness; and we got on pretty\r\nwell, and there was no rencontre between the highwaymen and the pistols\r\nwith which Fritz and I were provided. We lay that night at Kilcullen,\r\nand the next day I made my entry into the city of Dublin, with four\r\nhorses to my carriage, five thousand guineas in my purse, and one of the\r\nmost brilliant reputations in Europe, having quitted the city a beggarly\r\nboy, eleven years before.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Dublin have as great and laudable a desire for knowing\r\ntheir neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 concerns as the country people have; and it is\r\nimpossible for a gentleman, however modest his desires may be (and such\r\nmine have notoriously been through life), to enter the capital without\r\nhaving his name printed in every newspaper and mentioned in a number of\r\nsocieties. My name and titles were all over the town the day after my\r\narrival. A great number of polite persons did me the honour to call at\r\nmy lodgings, when I selected them; and this was a point very necessarily\r\nof immediate care, for the hotels in the town were but vulgar holes,\r\nunfit for a nobleman of my fashion and elegance. I had been informed\r\nof the fact by travellers on the Continent; and determining to fix on\r\na lodging at once, I bade the drivers go slowly up and down the streets\r\nwith my chariot, until I had selected a place suitable to my rank. This\r\nproceeding, and the uncouth questions and behaviour of my German Fritz,\r\nwho was instructed to make inquiries at the different houses until\r\nconvenient apartments could be lighted upon, brought an immense mob\r\nround my coach; and by the time the rooms were chosen you might have\r\nsupposed I was the new General of the Forces, so great was the multitude\r\nfollowing us.\r\n\r\nI fixed at length upon a handsome suite of apartments in Capel Street,\r\npaid the ragged postilions who had driven me a splendid gratuity, and\r\nestablishing myself in the rooms with my baggage and Fritz, desired the\r\nlandlord to engage me a second fellow to wear my liveries, a couple\r\nof stout reputable chairmen and their machine, and a coachman who\r\nhad handsome job-horses to hire for my chariot, and serviceable\r\nriding-horses to sell. I gave him a handsome sum in advance; and I\r\npromise you the effect of my advertisement was such, that next day I had\r\na regular levee in my antechamber: grooms, valets, and maitres-d\xe2\x80\x99hotel\r\noffered themselves without number; I had proposals for the purchase of\r\nhorses sufficient to mount a regiment, both from dealers and gentlemen\r\nof the first fashion. Sir Lawler Gawler came to propose to me the most\r\nelegant bay-mare ever stepped; my Lord Dundoodle had a team of four that\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t disgrace my friend the Emperor; and the Marquess of Ballyragget\r\nsent his gentleman and his compliments, stating that if I would step\r\nup to his stables, or do him the honour of breakfasting with him\r\npreviously, he would show me the two finest greys in Europe. I\r\ndetermined to accept the invitations of Dundoodle and Ballyragget,\r\nbut to purchase my horses from the dealers. It is always the best way.\r\nBesides, in those days, in Ireland, if a gentleman warranted his horse,\r\nand it was not sound, or a dispute arose, the remedy you had was the\r\noffer of a bullet in your waistcoat. I had played at the bullet game too\r\nmuch in earnest to make use of it heedlessly: and I may say, proudly for\r\nmyself, that I never engaged in a duel unless I had a real, available,\r\nand prudent reason for it.\r\n\r\nThere was a simplicity about this Irish gentry which amused and made me\r\nwonder. If they tell more fibs than their downright neighbours across\r\nthe water, on the other hand they believe more; and I made myself in a\r\nsingle week such a reputation in Dublin as would take a man ten years\r\nand a mint of money to acquire in London. I had won five hundred\r\nthousand pounds at play; I was the favourite of the Empress Catherine of\r\nRussia; the confidential agent of Frederick of Prussia; it was I won the\r\nbattle of Hochkirchen; I was the cousin of Madame Du Barry, the French\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s favourite, and a thousand things beside. Indeed, to tell the\r\ntruth, I hinted a number of these stories to my kind friends Ballyragget\r\nand Gawler; and they were not slow to improve the hints I gave them.\r\n\r\nAfter having witnessed the splendours of civilised life abroad, the\r\nsight of Dublin in the year 1771, when I returned thither, struck me\r\nwith anything but respect. It was as savage as Warsaw almost, without\r\nthe regal grandeur of the latter city. The people looked more ragged\r\nthan any race I have ever seen, except the gipsy hordes along the banks\r\nof the Danube. There was, as I have said, not an inn in the town fit for\r\na gentleman of condition to dwell in. Those luckless fellows who could\r\nnot keep a carriage, and walked the streets at night, ran imminent risks\r\nof the knives of the women and ruffians who lay in wait there,--of a set\r\nof ragged savage villains, who neither knew the use of shoe nor razor;\r\nand as a gentleman entered his chair or his chariot, to be carried to\r\nhis evening rout, or the play, the flambeaux of the footmen would light\r\nup such a set of wild gibbering Milesian faces as would frighten a\r\ngenteel person of average nerves. I was luckily endowed with strong\r\nones; besides, had seen my amiable countrymen before.\r\n\r\nI know this description of them will excite anger among some Irish\r\npatriots, who don\xe2\x80\x99t like to have the nakedness of our land abused, and\r\nare angry if the whole truth be told concerning it. But bah! it was a\r\npoor provincial place, Dublin, in the old days of which I speak; and\r\nmany a tenth-rate German residency is more genteel. There were, it is\r\ntrue, near three hundred resident Peers at the period; and a House of\r\nCommons; and my Lord Mayor and his corporation; and a roystering noisy\r\nUniversity, whereof the students made no small disturbances nightly,\r\npatronised the roundhouse, ducked obnoxious printers and tradesmen, and\r\ngave the law at the Crow Street Theatre. But I had seen too much of the\r\nfirst society of Europe to be much tempted by the society of these noisy\r\ngentry, and was a little too much of a gentleman to mingle with the\r\ndisputes and politics of my Lord Mayor and his Aldermen. In the House of\r\nCommons there were some dozen of right pleasant fellows. I never heard\r\nin the English Parliament better speeches than from Flood, and Daly, of\r\nGalway. Dick Sheridan, though not a well-bred person, was as amusing and\r\ningenious a table-companion as ever I met; and though during Mr. Edmund\r\nBurke\xe2\x80\x99s interminable speeches in the English House I used always to go\r\nto sleep, I yet have heard from well-informed parties that Mr. Burke was\r\na person of considerable abilities, and even reputed to be eloquent in\r\nhis more favourable moments.\r\n\r\nI soon began to enjoy to the full extent the pleasures that the wretched\r\nplace affords, and which were within a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s reach: Ranelagh and\r\nthe Ridotto; Mr. Mossop, at Crow Street; my Lord Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s parties,\r\nwhere there was a great deal too much boozing, and too little play, to\r\nsuit a person of my elegant and refined habits. \xe2\x80\x98Daly\xe2\x80\x99s Coffee-house,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand the houses of the nobility, were soon open to me; and I remarked\r\nwith astonishment in the higher circles, what I had experienced in the\r\nlower on my first unhappy visit to Dublin, an extraordinary want of\r\nmoney, and a preposterous deal of promissory notes flying about, for\r\nwhich I was quite unwilling to stake my guineas. The ladies, too, were\r\nmad for play; but exceeding unwilling to pay when they lost. Thus, when\r\nthe old Countess of Trumpington lost ten pieces to me at quadrille, she\r\ngave me, instead of the money, her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s note of hand on her\r\nagent in Galway; which I put, with a great deal of politeness, into the\r\ncandle. But when the Countess made me a second proposition to play, I\r\nsaid that as soon as her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s remittances were arrived, I would\r\nbe the readiest person to meet her; but till then was her very humble\r\nservant. And I maintained this resolution and singular character\r\nthroughout the Dublin society: giving out at \xe2\x80\x98Daly\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 that I was ready\r\nto play any man, for any sum, at any game; or to fence with him, or to\r\nride with him (regard being had to our weight), or to shoot flying, or\r\nat a mark; and in this latter accomplishment, especially if the mark be\r\na live one, Irish gentlemen of that day had no ordinary skill.\r\n\r\nOf course I despatched a courier in my liveries to Castle Lyndon with\r\na private letter for Runt, demanding from him full particulars of\r\nthe Countess of Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s state of health and mind; and a touching and\r\neloquent letter to her Ladyship, in which I bade her remember ancient\r\ndays, which I tied up with a single hair from the lock which I had\r\npurchased from her woman, and in which I told her that Sylvander\r\nremembered his oath, and could never forget his Calista. The answer I\r\nreceived from her was exceedingly unsatisfactory and inexplicit; that\r\nfrom Mr. Runt explicit enough, but not at all pleasant in its contents.\r\nMy Lord George Poynings, the Marquess of Tiptoff\xe2\x80\x99s younger son, was\r\npaying very marked addresses to the widow; being a kinsman of the\r\nfamily, and having been called to Ireland relative to the will of the\r\ndeceased Sir Charles Lyndon.\r\n\r\nNow, there was a sort of rough-and-ready law in Ireland in those days,\r\nwhich was of great convenience to persons desirous of expeditious\r\njustice; and of which the newspapers of the time contain a hundred\r\nproofs. Fellows with the nicknames of Captain Fireball, Lieutenant\r\nBuffcoat, and Ensign Steele, were repeatedly sending warning letters\r\nto landlords, and murdering them if the notes were unattended to. The\r\ncelebrated Captain Thunder ruled in the southern counties, and his\r\nbusiness seemed to be to procure wives for gentlemen who had not\r\nsufficient means to please the parents of the young ladies; or, perhaps,\r\nhad not time for a long and intricate courtship.\r\n\r\nI had found my cousin Ulick at Dublin, grown very fat, and very poor;\r\nhunted up by Jews and creditors: dwelling in all sorts of queer corners,\r\nfrom which he issued at nightfall to the Castle, or to his card-party at\r\nhis tavern; but he was always the courageous fellow: and I hinted to him\r\nthe state of my affections regarding Lady Lyndon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Countess of Lyndon!\xe2\x80\x99 said poor Ulick; \xe2\x80\x98well, that IS a wonder. I\r\nmyself have been mightily sweet upon a young lady, one of the Kiljoys of\r\nBallyhack, who has ten thousand pounds to her fortune, and to whom her\r\nLadyship is guardian; but how is a poor fellow without a coat to his\r\nback to get on with an heiress in such company as that? I might as well\r\npropose for the Countess myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better not,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, laughing; \xe2\x80\x98the man who tries runs a\r\nchance of going out of the world first.\xe2\x80\x99 And I explained to him my own\r\nintention regarding Lady Lyndon. Honest Ulick, whose respect for me was\r\nprodigious when he saw how splendid my appearance was, and heard how\r\nwonderful my adventures and great my experience of fashionable life had\r\nbeen, was lost in admiration of my daring and energy, when I confided to\r\nhim my intention of marrying the greatest heiress in England.\r\n\r\nI bade Ulick go out of town on any pretext he chose, and put a letter\r\ninto a post-office near Castle Lyndon, which I prepared in a feigned\r\nhand, and in which I gave a solemn warning to Lord George Poynings to\r\nquit the country; saying that the great prize was never meant for the\r\nlikes of him, and that there were heiresses enough in England, without\r\ncoming to rob them out of the domains of Captain Fireball. The letter\r\nwas written on a dirty piece of paper, in the worst of spelling: it came\r\nto my Lord by the post-conveyance, and, being a high-spirited young man,\r\nhe of course laughed at it.\r\n\r\nAs ill-luck would have it for him, he appeared in Dublin a very short\r\ntime afterwards; was introduced to the Chevalier Redmond Barry, at the\r\nLord Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s table; adjourned with him and several other gentlemen\r\nto the club at \xe2\x80\x98Daly\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 and there, in a dispute about the pedigree of\r\na horse, in which everybody said I was in the right, words arose, and\r\na meeting was the consequence. I had had no affair in Dublin since\r\nmy arrival, and people were anxious to see whether I was equal to my\r\nreputation. I make no boast about these matters, but always do them when\r\nthe time comes; and poor Lord George, who had a neat hand and a quick\r\neye enough, but was bred in the clumsy English school, only stood before\r\nmy point until I had determined where I should hit him.\r\n\r\nMy sword went in under his guard, and came out at his back. When he\r\nfell, he good-naturedly extended his hand to me, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Barry, I\r\nwas wrong!\xe2\x80\x99 I felt not very well at ease when the poor fellow made this\r\nconfession: for the dispute had been of my making, and, to tell the\r\ntruth, I had never intended it should end in any other way than a\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nHe lay on his bed for four months with the effects of that wound;\r\nand the same post which conveyed to Lady Lyndon the news of the duel,\r\ncarried her a message from Captain Fireball to say, \xe2\x80\x98This is NUMBER\r\nONE!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, Ulick,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98shall be NUMBER TWO.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Faith,\xe2\x80\x99 said my cousin, \xe2\x80\x98one\xe2\x80\x99s enough:\xe2\x80\x99 But I had my plan regarding\r\nhim, and determined at once to benefit this honest fellow, and to\r\nforward my own designs upon the widow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. I PAY COURT TO MY LADY LYNDON\r\n\r\nAs my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s attainder was not reversed for being out with the\r\nPretender in 1745, it would have been inconvenient for him to accompany\r\nhis nephew to the land of our ancestors; where, if not hanging, at least\r\na tedious process of imprisonment, and a doubtful pardon, would have\r\nawaited the good old gentleman. In any important crisis of my life, his\r\nadvice was always of advantage to me, and I did not fail to seek it at\r\nthis juncture, and to implore his counsel as regarded my pursuit of the\r\nwidow. I told him the situation of her heart, as I have described it in\r\nthe last chapter; of the progress that young Poynings had made in her\r\naffections, and of her forgetfulness of her old admirer; and I got a\r\nletter, in reply, full of excellent suggestions, by which I did not fail\r\nto profit. The kind Chevalier prefaced it by saying, that he was for\r\nthe present boarding in the Minorite convent at Brussels; that he had\r\nthoughts of making his salut there, and retiring for ever from the\r\nworld, devoting himself to the severest practices of religion. Meanwhile\r\nhe wrote with regard to the lovely widow: it was natural that a person\r\nof her vast wealth and not disagreeable person should have many adorers\r\nabout her; and that, as in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime she had shown herself\r\nnot at all disinclined to receive my addresses, I must make no manner\r\nof doubt I was not the first person whom she had so favoured; nor was I\r\nlikely to be the last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would, my dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, \xe2\x80\x98that the ugly attainder round my\r\nneck, and the resolution I have formed of retiring from a world of sin\r\nand vanity altogether, did not prevent me from coming personally to your\r\naid in this delicate crisis of your affairs; for, to lead them to a\r\ngood end, it requires not only the indomitable courage, swagger, and\r\naudacity, which you possess beyond any young man I have ever known\xe2\x80\x99 (as\r\nfor the \xe2\x80\x98swagger,\xe2\x80\x99 as the Chevalier calls it, I deny it in toto, being\r\nalways most modest in my demeanour); \xe2\x80\x98but though you have the vigour to\r\nexecute, you have not the ingenuity to suggest plans of conduct for the\r\nfollowing out of a scheme that is likely to be long and difficult of\r\nexecution. Would you have ever thought of the brilliant scheme of the\r\nCountess Ida, which so nearly made you the greatest fortune in Europe,\r\nbut for the advice and experience of a poor old man, now making up his\r\naccounts with the world, and about to retire from it for good and all?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, with regard to the Countess of Lyndon, your manner of winning her\r\nis quite en l\xe2\x80\x99air at present to me; nor can I advise day by day, as\r\nI would I could, according to circumstances as they arise. But your\r\ngeneral scheme should be this. If I remember the letters you used to\r\nhave from her during the period of the correspondence which the silly\r\nwoman entertained you with, much high-flown sentiment passed between\r\nyou; and especially was written by her Ladyship herself: she is a\r\nblue-stocking, and fond of writing; she used to make her griefs with her\r\nhusband the continual theme of her correspondence (as women will do). I\r\nrecollect several passages in her letters bitterly deploring her fate in\r\nbeing united to one so unworthy of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely, in the mass of billets you possess from her, there must be\r\nenough to compromise her. Look them well over; select passages, and\r\nthreaten to do so. Write to her at first in the undoubting tone of a\r\nlover who has every claim upon her. Then, if she is silent, remonstrate,\r\nalluding to former promises from her; producing proofs of her former\r\nregard for you; vowing despair, destruction, revenge, if she prove\r\nunfaithful. Frighten her--astonish her by some daring feat, which will\r\nlet her see your indomitable resolution: you are the man to do it. Your\r\nsword has a reputation in Europe, and you have a character for boldness;\r\nwhich was the first thing that caused my Lady Lyndon to turn her eyes\r\nupon you. Make the people talk about you at Dublin. Be as splendid, and\r\nas brave, and as odd as possible. How I wish I were near you! You have\r\nno imagination to invent such a character as I would make for you--but\r\nwhy speak; have I not had enough of the world and its vanities?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was much practical good sense in this advice; which I quote,\r\nunaccompanied with the lengthened description of his mortifications and\r\ndevotions which my uncle indulged in, finishing his letter, as usual,\r\nwith earnest prayers for my conversion to the true faith. But he\r\nwas constant to his form of worship; and I, as a man of honour and\r\nprinciple, was resolute to mine; and have no doubt that the one, in this\r\nrespect, will be as acceptable as the other.\r\n\r\nUnder these directions it was, then, I wrote to Lady Lyndon, to ask on\r\nmy arrival when the most respectful of her admirers might be permitted\r\nto intrude upon her grief? Then, as her Ladyship was silent, I demanded,\r\nHad she forgotten old times, and one whom she had favoured with her\r\nintimacy at a very happy period? Had Calista forgotten Eugenio? At the\r\nsame time I sent down by my servant with this letter a present of a\r\nlittle sword for Lord Bullingdon, and a private note to his governor;\r\nwhose note of hand, by the way, I possessed for a sum--I forget\r\nwhat--but such as the poor fellow would have been very unwilling to pay.\r\nTo this an answer came from her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s amanuensis, stating that Lady\r\nLyndon was too much disturbed by grief at her recent dreadful calamity\r\nto see any one but her own relations; and advices from my friend, the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s governor, stating that my Lord George Poynings was the young\r\nkinsman who was about to console her.\r\n\r\nThis caused the quarrel between me and the young nobleman; whom I took\r\ncare to challenge on his first arrival at Dublin.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the duel was brought to the widow at Castle Lyndon, my\r\ninformant wrote me that Lady Lyndon shrieked and flung down the journal,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98The horrible monster! He would not shrink from murder, I\r\nbelieve;\xe2\x80\x99 and little Lord Bullingdon, drawing his sword--the sword I had\r\ngiven him, the rascal!--declared he would kill with it the man who had\r\nhurt Cousin George. On Mr. Runt telling him that I was the donor of the\r\nweapon, the little rogue still vowed that he would kill me all the same!\r\nIndeed, in spite of my kindness to him, that boy always seemed to detest\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHer Ladyship sent up daily couriers to inquire after the health of Lord\r\nGeorge; and, thinking to myself that she would probably be induced to\r\ncome to Dublin if she were to hear that he was in danger, I managed to\r\nhave her informed that he was in a precarious state; that he grew worse;\r\nthat Redmond Barry had fled in consequence: of this flight I caused the\r\nMercury newspaper to give notice also, but indeed it did not carry me\r\nbeyond the town of Bray, where my poor mother dwelt; and where, under\r\nthe difficulties of a duel, I might be sure of having a welcome.\r\n\r\nThose readers who have the sentiment of filial duty strong in their\r\nmind, will wonder that I have not yet described my interview with that\r\nkind mother whose sacrifices for me in youth had been so considerable,\r\nand for whom a man of my warm and affectionate nature could not but feel\r\nthe most enduring and sincere regard.\r\n\r\nBut a man, moving in the exalted sphere of society in which I now\r\nstood, has his public duties to perform before he consults his private\r\naffections; and so, upon my first arrival, I despatched a messenger\r\nto Mrs. Barry, stating my arrival, conveying to her my sentiments of\r\nrespect and duty, and promising to pay them to her personally so soon as\r\nmy business in Dublin would leave me free.\r\n\r\nThis, I need not say, was very considerable. I had my horses to buy, my\r\nestablishment to arrange, my entree into the genteel world to make; and,\r\nhaving announced my intention to purchase horses and live in a genteel\r\nstyle, was in a couple of days so pestered by visits of the nobility and\r\ngentry, and so hampered by invitations to dinners and suppers, that\r\nit became exceedingly difficult for me during some days to manage my\r\nanxiously desired visit to Mrs. Barry.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the good soul provided an entertainment as soon as she\r\nheard of my arrival, and invited all her humble acquaintances of Bray to\r\nbe present: but I was engaged subsequently to my Lord Ballyragget on the\r\nday appointed, and was, of course, obliged to break the promise that I\r\nhad made to Mrs. Barry to attend her humble festival.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to sweeten the disappointment by sending my mother a\r\nhandsome satin sack and velvet robe, which I purchased for her at the\r\nbest mercers in Dublin (and indeed told her I had brought from Paris\r\nexpressly for her); but the messenger whom I despatched with the\r\npresents brought back the parcels, with the piece of satin torn half\r\nway up the middle: and I did not need his descriptions to be aware that\r\nsomething had offended the good lady; who came out, he said, and\r\nabused him at the door, and would have boxed his cars, but that she was\r\nrestrained by a gentleman in black; who I concluded, with justice, was\r\nher clerical friend Mr. Jowls.\r\n\r\nThis reception of my presents made me rather dread than hope for an\r\ninterview with Mrs. Barry, and delayed my visit to her for some days\r\nfurther. I wrote her a dutiful and soothing letter, to which there was\r\nno answer returned; although I mentioned that on my way to the capital I\r\nhad been at Barryville, and revisited the old haunts of my youth.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to own that she is the only human being whom I am afraid\r\nto face. I can recollect her fits of anger as a child, and the\r\nreconciliations, which used to be still more violent and painful: and\r\nso, instead of going myself, I sent my factotum, Ulick Brady, to her;\r\nwho rode back, saying that he had met with a reception he would not\r\nagain undergo for twenty guineas; that he had been dismissed the house,\r\nwith strict injunctions to inform me that my mother disowned me for\r\never. This parental anathema, as it were, affected me much, for I was\r\nalways the most dutiful of sons; and I determined to go as soon as\r\npossible, and brave what I knew must be an inevitable scene of reproach\r\nand anger, for the sake, as I hoped, of as certain a reconciliation.\r\n\r\nI had been giving one night an entertainment to some of the genteelest\r\ncompany in Dublin, and was showing my Lord Marquess downstairs with a\r\npair of wax tapers, when I found a woman in a grey coat seated at my\r\ndoorsteps: to whom, taking her for a beggar, I tendered a piece of\r\nmoney, and whom my noble friends, who were rather hot with wine, began\r\nto joke, as my door closed and I bade them all good-night.\r\n\r\nI was rather surprised and affected to find afterwards that the hooded\r\nwoman was no other than my mother; whose pride had made her vow that she\r\nwould not enter my doors, but whose natural maternal yearnings had made\r\nher long to see her son\xe2\x80\x99s face once again, and who had thus planted\r\nherself in disguise at my gate. Indeed, I have found in my experience\r\nthat these are the only women who never deceive a man, and whose\r\naffection remains constant through all trials. Think of the hours that\r\nthe kind soul must have passed, lonely in the street, listening to the\r\ndin and merriment within my apartments, the clinking of the glasses, the\r\nlaughing, the choruses, and the cheering.\r\n\r\nWhen my affair with Lord George happened, and it became necessary to me,\r\nfor the reasons I have stated, to be out of the way; now, thought I, is\r\nthe time to make my peace with my good mother: she will never refuse me\r\nan asylum now that I seem in distress. So sending to her a notice that I\r\nwas coming, that I had had a duel which had brought me into trouble, and\r\nrequired I should go into hiding, I followed my messenger half-an-hour\r\nafterwards: and, I warrant me, there was no want of a good reception,\r\nfor presently, being introduced into an empty room by the barefooted\r\nmaid who waited upon Mrs. Barry, the door was opened, and the poor\r\nmother flung herself into my arms with a scream, and with transports\r\nof joy which I shall not attempt to describe--they are but to be\r\ncomprehended by women who have held in their arms an only child after a\r\ntwelve years\xe2\x80\x99 absence from him.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Mr. Jowls, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s director, was the only person to\r\nwhom the door of her habitation was opened during my sojourn; and he\r\nwould take no denial. He mixed for himself a glass of rum-punch, which\r\nhe seemed in the habit of drinking at my good mother\xe2\x80\x99s charge, groaned\r\naloud, and forthwith began reading me a lecture upon the sinfulness of\r\nmy past courses, and especially of the last horrible action I had been\r\ncommitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sinful!\xe2\x80\x99 said my mother, bristling up when her son was attacked;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98sure we\xe2\x80\x99re all sinners; and it\xe2\x80\x99s you, Mr. Jowls, who have given me the\r\ninexpressible blessing to let me know THAT. But how else would you have\r\nhad the poor child behave?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would have had the gentleman avoid the drink, and the quarrel, and\r\nthis wicked duel altogether,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the clergyman.\r\n\r\nBut my mother cut him short, by saying such sort of conduct might be\r\nvery well in a person of his cloth and his birth, but it neither became\r\na Brady nor a Barry. In fact, she was quite delighted with the thought\r\nthat I had pinked an English marquis\xe2\x80\x99s son in a duel; and so, to console\r\nher, I told her of a score more in which I had been engaged, and of some\r\nof which I have already informed the reader.\r\n\r\nAs my late antagonist was in no sort of danger when I spread that report\r\nof his perilous situation, there was no particular call that my hiding\r\nshould be very close. But the widow did not know the fact as well as I\r\ndid: and caused her house to be barricaded, and Becky, her barefooted\r\nserving-wench, to be a perpetual sentinel to give alarm, lest the\r\nofficers should be in search of me.\r\n\r\nThe only person I expected, however, was my cousin Ulick, who was to\r\nbring me the welcome intelligence of Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s arrival; and I own,\r\nafter two days\xe2\x80\x99 close confinement at Bray, in which I narrated all the\r\nadventures of my life to my mother, and succeeded in making her accept\r\nthe dresses she had formerly refused, and a considerable addition to\r\nher income which I was glad to make, I was very glad when I saw that\r\nreprobate Ulick Brady, as my mother called him, ride up to the door in\r\nmy carriage with the welcome intelligence for my mother, that the young\r\nlord was out of danger; and for me, that the Countess of Lyndon had\r\narrived in Dublin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I wish, Redmond, that the young gentleman had been in danger a\r\nlittle longer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the widow, her eyes filling with tears, \xe2\x80\x98and you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave stayed so much the more with your poor old mother.\xe2\x80\x99 But I dried her\r\ntears, embracing her warmly, and promised to see her often; and hinted\r\nI would have, mayhap, a house of my own and a noble daughter to welcome\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is she, Redmond dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of the noblest and richest women in the empire, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nI. \xe2\x80\x98No mere Brady this time,\xe2\x80\x99 I added, laughing: with which hopes I left\r\nMrs. Barry in the best of tempers.\r\n\r\nNo man can bear less malice than I do; and, when I have once carried\r\nmy point, I am one of the most placable creatures in the world. I was a\r\nweek in Dublin before I thought it necessary to quit that capital. I\r\nhad become quite reconciled to my rival in that time; made a point of\r\ncalling at his lodgings, and speedily became an intimate consoler of his\r\nbed-side. He had a gentleman to whom I did not neglect to be civil, and\r\ntowards whom I ordered my people to be particular in their attentions;\r\nfor I was naturally anxious to learn what my Lord George\xe2\x80\x99s position with\r\nthe lady of Castle Lyndon had really been, whether other suitors were\r\nabout the widow, and how she would bear the news of his wound.\r\n\r\nThe young nobleman himself enlightened me somewhat upon the subjects I\r\nwas most desirous to inquire into.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to me one morning when I went to pay him my\r\ncompliments, \xe2\x80\x98I find you are an old acquaintance with my kinswoman, the\r\nCountess of Lyndon. She writes me a page of abuse of you in a letter\r\nhere; and the strange part of the story is this, that one day when there\r\nwas talk about you at Castle Lyndon, and the splendid equipage you were\r\nexhibiting in Dublin, the fair widow vowed and protested she never had\r\nheard of you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little Bullingdon, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tall dark man at Spa\r\nwith the cast in his eye, who used to make my governor tipsy and sent me\r\nthe sword: his name is Mr. Barry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But my Lady ordered the boy out of the room, and persisted in knowing\r\nnothing about you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And are you a kinsman and acquaintance of my Lady Lyndon, my Lord?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I, in a tone of grave surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the young gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I left her house but to\r\nget this ugly wound from you. And it came at a most unlucky time too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why more unlucky now than at another moment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, look you, Chevalier, I think the widow was not unpartial to me. I\r\nthink I might have induced her to make our connection a little closer:\r\nand faith, though she is older than I am, she is the richest party now\r\nin England.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Lord George,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98will you let me ask you a frank but an odd\r\nquestion?--will you show me her letters?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed I\xe2\x80\x99ll do no such thing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied he, in a rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry. If _I_ show you letters of Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s to me,\r\nwill you let me see hers to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, do you mean, Mr. Barry?\xe2\x80\x99 said the young\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_I_ mean that I passionately loved Lady Lyndon. I mean that I am\r\na--that I rather was not indifferent to her. I mean that I love her to\r\ndistraction at this present moment, and will die myself, or kill the man\r\nwho possesses her before me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98YOU marry the greatest heiress and the noblest blood in England?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLord George haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no nobler blood in Europe than mine,\xe2\x80\x99 answered I: \xe2\x80\x98and I tell\r\nyou I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to hope or not. But this I know, that there\r\nwere days in which, poor as I am, the great heiress did not disdain to\r\nlook down upon my poverty: and that any man who marries her passes over\r\nmy dead body to do it. It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for you,\xe2\x80\x99 I added gloomily, \xe2\x80\x98that on\r\nthe occasion of my engagement with you, I did not know what were your\r\nviews regarding my Lady Lyndon. My poor boy, you are a lad of courage\r\nand I love you. Mine is the first sword in Europe, and you would have\r\nbeen lying in a narrower bed than that you now occupy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lord George: \xe2\x80\x98I am not four years younger than you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are forty years younger than I am in experience. I have passed\r\nthrough every grade of life. With my own skill and daring I have made\r\nmy own fortune. I have been in fourteen pitched battles as a private\r\nsoldier, and have been twenty-three times on the ground, and never was\r\ntouched but once; and that was by the sword of a French maitre-d\xe2\x80\x99armes,\r\nWhom I killed. I started in life at seventeen, a beggar, and am now at\r\nseven-and-twenty, with twenty thousand guineas. Do you suppose a man\r\nof my courage and energy can\xe2\x80\x99t attain anything that he dares, and that\r\nhaving claims upon the widow, I will not press them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis speech was not exactly true to the letter (for I had multiplied my\r\npitched battles, my duels, and my wealth somewhat); but I saw that it\r\nmade the impression I desired to effect upon the young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, who listened to my statement with peculiar seriousness, and whom I\r\npresently left to digest it.\r\n\r\nA couple of days afterwards I called to see him again, when I brought\r\nwith me some of the letters that had passed between me and my Lady\r\nLyndon. \xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98look--I show it you in confidence--it is a\r\nlock of her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s hair; here are her letters signed Calista, and\r\naddressed to Eugenio. Here is a poem, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Sol bedecks the mead with\r\nlight, And pallid Cynthia sheds her ray,\xe2\x80\x9d addressed by her Ladyship to\r\nyour humble servant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Calista! Eugenio! Sol bedecks the mead with light?\xe2\x80\x99 cried the young\r\nlord. \xe2\x80\x98Am I dreaming? Why, my dear Barry, the widow has sent me the\r\nvery poem herself! \xe2\x80\x9cRejoicing in the sunshine bright, Or musing in the\r\nevening grey.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing as he made the quotation. They were, in\r\nfact, the very words MY Calista had addressed to me. And we found, upon\r\ncomparing letters, that whole passages of eloquence figured in the\r\none correspondence which appeared in the other. See what it is to be a\r\nblue-stocking and have a love of letter-writing!\r\n\r\nThe young man put down the papers in great perturbation. \xe2\x80\x98Well, thank\r\nHeaven!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, after a pause of some duration,--\xe2\x80\x98thank Heaven for\r\na good riddance! Ah, Mr. Barry, what a woman I MIGHT have married had\r\nthese lucky papers not come in my way! I thought my Lady Lyndon had a\r\nheart, sir, I must confess, though not a very warm one; and that, at\r\nleast, one could TRUST her. But marry her now! I would as lief send\r\nmy servant into the street to get me a wife, as put up with such an\r\nEphesian matron as that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Lord George,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98you little know the world. Remember what a\r\nbad husband Lady Lyndon had, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be astonished that she, on her\r\nside, should be indifferent. Nor has she, I will dare to wager, ever\r\npassed beyond the bounds of harmless gallantry, or sinned beyond the\r\ncomposing of a sonnet or a billet-doux.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little lord, \xe2\x80\x98shall write no sonnets or\r\nbillets-doux; and I\xe2\x80\x99m heartily glad to think I have obtained, in good\r\ntime, a knowledge of the heartless vixen with whom I thought myself for\r\na moment in love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wounded young nobleman was either, as I have said, very young and\r\ngreen in matters of the world--for to suppose that a man would give up\r\nforty thousand a year, because, forsooth, the lady connected with it had\r\nwritten a few sentimental letters to a young fellow, is too absurd--or,\r\nas I am inclined to believe, he was glad of an excuse to quit the field\r\naltogether, being by no means anxious to meet the victorious sword of\r\nRedmond Barry a second time.\r\n\r\nWhen the idea of Poynings\xe2\x80\x99 danger, or the reproaches probably addressed\r\nby him to the widow regarding myself, had brought this exceedingly weak\r\nand feeble woman up to Dublin, as I expected, and my worthy Ulick had\r\ninformed me of her arrival, I quitted my good mother, who was quite\r\nreconciled to me (indeed the duel had done that), and found the\r\ndisconsolate Calista was in the habit of paying visits to the wounded\r\nswain; much to the annoyance, the servants told me, of that gentleman.\r\nThe English are often absurdly high and haughty upon a point of\r\npunctilio; and, after his kinswoman\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, Lord Poynings swore he\r\nwould have no more to do with her.\r\n\r\nI had this information from his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s gentleman; with whom, as\r\nI have said, I took particular care to be friends; nor was I denied\r\nadmission by his porter, when I chose to call, as before.\r\n\r\nHer Ladyship had most likely bribed that person, as I had; for she had\r\nfound her way up, though denied admission; and, in fact, I had watched\r\nher from her own house to Lord George Poynings\xe2\x80\x99 lodgings, and seen her\r\ndescend from her chair there and enter, before I myself followed her. I\r\nproposed to await her quietly in the ante-room, to make a scene there,\r\nand reproach her with infidelity, if necessary; but matters were, as\r\nit happened, arranged much more conveniently for me; and walking,\r\nunannounced, into the outer room of his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s apartments, I had the\r\nfelicity of hearing in the next chamber, of which the door was partially\r\nopen, the voice of my Calista. She was in full cry, appealing to the\r\npoor patient, as he lay confined in his bed, and speaking in the most\r\npassionate manner. \xe2\x80\x98What can lead you, George,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98to doubt of\r\nmy faith? How can you break my heart by casting me off in this monstrous\r\nmanner? Do you wish to drive your poor Calista to the grave? Well, well,\r\nI shall join there the dear departed angel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who entered it three months since,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lord George, with a sneer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder you have survived so long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t treat your poor Calista in this cruel cruel manner, Antonio!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried the widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lord George, \xe2\x80\x98my wound is bad. My doctors forbid me much\r\ntalk. Suppose your Antonio tired, my dear. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you console yourself\r\nwith somebody else?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heavens, Lord George! Antonio!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Console yourself with Eugenio,\xe2\x80\x99 said the young nobleman bitterly, and\r\nbegan ringing his bell; on which his valet, who was in an inner room,\r\ncame out, and he bade him show her Ladyship downstairs.\r\n\r\nLady Lyndon issued from the room in the greatest flurry. She was dressed\r\nin deep weeds, with a veil over her face, and did not recognise the\r\nperson waiting in the outer apartment. As she went down the stairs, I\r\nstepped lightly after her, and as her chairman opened her door, sprang\r\nforward, and took her hand to place her in the vehicle. \xe2\x80\x98Dearest widow,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I, \xe2\x80\x98his Lordship spoke correctly. Console yourself with Eugenio!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe was too frightened even to scream, as her chairman carried her away.\r\nShe was set down at her house, and you may be sure that I was at the\r\nchair-door, as before, to help her out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Monstrous man!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I desire you to leave me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Madam, it would be against my oath,\xe2\x80\x99 replied I; \xe2\x80\x98recollect the vow\r\nEugenio sent to Calista.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you do not quit me, I will call for the domestics to turn you from\r\nthe door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! when I am come with my Calista\xe2\x80\x99s letters in my pocket, to return\r\nthem mayhap? You can soothe, madam, but you cannot frighten Redmond\r\nBarry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it you would have of me, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the widow, rather agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me come upstairs, and I will tell you all,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied; and she\r\ncondescended to give me her hand, and to permit me to lead her from her\r\nchair to her drawing-room.\r\n\r\nWhen we were alone I opened my mind honourably to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98do not let your cruelty drive a desperate\r\nslave to fatal measures. I adore you. In former days you allowed me to\r\nwhisper my passion to you unrestrained; at present you drive me from\r\nyour door, leave my letters unanswered, and prefer another to me. My\r\nflesh and blood cannot bear such treatment. Look upon the punishment I\r\nhave been obliged to inflict; tremble at that which I may be compelled\r\nto administer to that unfortunate young man: so sure as he marries you,\r\nmadam, he dies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not recognise,\xe2\x80\x99 said the widow, \xe2\x80\x98the least right you have to give\r\nthe law to the Countess of Lyndon: I do not in the least understand\r\nyour threats, or heed them. What has passed between me and an Irish\r\nadventurer that should authorise this impertinent intrusion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THESE have passed, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said I,--\xe2\x80\x98Calista\xe2\x80\x99s letters to Eugenio. They\r\nmay have been very innocent; but will the world believe it? You may have\r\nonly intended to play with the heart of the poor artless Irish gentleman\r\nwho adored and confided in you. But who will believe the stories of your\r\ninnocence, against the irrefragable testimony of your own handwriting?\r\nWho will believe that you could write these letters in the mere\r\nwantonness of coquetry, and not under the influence of affection?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Villain!\xe2\x80\x99 cried my Lady Lyndon, \xe2\x80\x98could you dare to construe out of\r\nthose idle letters of mine any other meaning than that which they really\r\nbear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will construe anything out of them,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98such is the passion\r\nwhich animates me towards you. I have sworn it--you must and shall be\r\nmine! Did you ever know me promise to accomplish a thing and fail? Which\r\nwill you prefer to have from me--a love such as woman never knew from\r\nman before, or a hatred to which there exists no parallel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A woman of my rank, sir, can fear nothing from the hatred of an\r\nadventurer like yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the lady, drawing up stately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at your Poynings--was HE of your rank? You are the cause of that\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s wound, madam; and, but that the instrument of your savage\r\ncruelty relented, would have been the author of his murder--yes, of his\r\nmurder; for, if a wife is faithless, does not she arm the husband who\r\npunishes the seducer! And I look upon you, Honoria Lyndon, as my wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Husband? wife, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the widow, quite astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, wife! husband! I am not one of those poor souls with whom\r\ncoquettes can play, and who may afterwards throw them aside. You would\r\nforget what passed between us at Spa: Calista would forget Eugenio; but\r\nI will not let you forget me. You thought to trifle with my heart, did\r\nyou? When once moved, Honoria, it is moved for ever. I love you--love as\r\npassionately now as I did when my passion was hopeless; and, now that\r\nI can win you, do you think I will forego you? Cruel cruel Calista! you\r\nlittle know the power of your own charms if you think their effect is so\r\neasily obliterated--you little know the constancy of this pure and noble\r\nheart if you think that, having once loved, it can ever cease to\r\nadore you. No! I swear by your cruelty that I will revenge it; by your\r\nwonderful beauty that I will win it, and be worthy to win it. Lovely,\r\nfascinating, fickle, cruel woman! you shall be mine--I swear it! Your\r\nwealth may be great; but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it\r\nworthily? Your rank is lofty; but not so lofty as my ambition. You threw\r\nyourself away once on a cold and spiritless debauchee: give yourself\r\nnow, Honoria, to a MAN; and one who, however lofty your rank may be,\r\nwill enhance it and become it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs I poured words to this effect out on the astonished widow, I stood\r\nover her, and fascinated her with the glance of my eye; saw her turn red\r\nand pale with fear and wonder; saw that my praise of her charms and the\r\nexposition of my passion were not unwelcome to her, and witnessed with\r\ntriumphant composure the mastery I was gaining over her. Terror, be sure\r\nof that, is not a bad ingredient of love. A man who wills fiercely to\r\nwin the heart of a weak and vapourish woman MUST succeed, if he have\r\nopportunity enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Terrible man!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Lyndon, shrinking from me as soon as I had\r\ndone speaking (indeed, I was at a loss for words, and thinking of\r\nanother speech to make to her)--\xe2\x80\x98terrible man! leave me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI saw that I had made an impression on her, from those very words. \xe2\x80\x98If\r\nshe lets me into the house to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98she is mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs I went downstairs I put ten guineas into the hand of the hall-porter,\r\nwho looked quite astonished at such a gift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is to repay you for the trouble of opening the door to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said I;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you will have to do so often.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. I PROVIDE NOBLY FOR MY FAMILY\r\n\r\nThe next day when I went back, my fears were realised: the door was\r\nrefused to me--my Lady was not at home. This I knew to be false: I had\r\nwatched the door the whole morning from a lodging I took at a house\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your lady is not out,\xe2\x80\x99 said I: \xe2\x80\x98she has denied me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t, of\r\ncourse, force my way to her. But listen: you are an Englishman?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nI am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fellow, with an air of the utmost superiority. \xe2\x80\x98Your\r\nhonour could tell that by my HACCENT.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI knew he was, and might therefore offer him a bribe. An Irish family\r\nservant in rags, and though his wages were never paid him, would\r\nprobably fling the money in your face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98Your lady\xe2\x80\x99s letters pass through your hands,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t they? A crown for every one that you bring me to read. There is a\r\nwhisky-shop in the next street; bring them there when you go to drink,\r\nand call for me by the name of Dermot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I recollect your honour at SPAR,\xe2\x80\x99 says the fellow, grinning: \xe2\x80\x98seven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe main, hey?\xe2\x80\x99 and being exceedingly proud of this reminiscence, I bade\r\nmy inferior adieu.\r\n\r\nI do not defend this practice of letter-opening in private life, except\r\nin cases of the most urgent necessity: when we must follow the examples\r\nof our betters, the statesmen of all Europe, and, for the sake of a\r\ngreat good, infringe a little matter of ceremony. My Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters were none the worse for being opened, and a great deal\r\nthe better; the knowledge obtained from the perusal of some of her\r\nmultifarious epistles enabling me to become intimate with her character\r\nin a hundred ways, and obtain a power over her by which I was not slow\r\nto profit. By the aid of the letters and of my English friend, whom I\r\nalways regaled with the best of liquor, and satisfied with presents of\r\nmoney still more agreeable (I used to put on a livery in order to meet\r\nhim, and a red wig, in which it was impossible to know the dashing and\r\nelegant Redmond Barry), I got such an insight into the widow\xe2\x80\x99s movements\r\nas astonished her. I knew beforehand to what public places she would\r\ngo; they were, on account of her widowhood, but few: and wherever she\r\nappeared, at church or in the park, I was always ready to offer her her\r\nbook, or to canter on horseback by the side of her chariot.\r\n\r\nMany of her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s letters were the most whimsical rodomontades that\r\never blue-stocking penned. She was a woman who took up and threw off\r\na greater number of dear friends than any one I ever knew. To some of\r\nthese female darlings she began presently to write about my unworthy\r\nself, and it was with a sentiment of extreme satisfaction I found at\r\nlength that the widow was growing dreadfully afraid of me; calling me\r\nher bete noire, her dark spirit, her murderous adorer, and a thousand\r\nother names indicative of her extreme disquietude and terror. It was:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wretch has been dogging my chariot through the park,\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98my fate\r\npursued me at church,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98my inevitable adorer handed me out of\r\nmy chair at the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 or what not. My wish was to increase this\r\nsentiment of awe in her bosom, and to make her believe that I was a\r\nperson from whom escape was impossible.\r\n\r\nTo this end I bribed a fortune-teller, whom she consulted along with a\r\nnumber of the most foolish and distinguished people of Dublin, in those\r\ndays; and who, although she went dressed like one of her waiting-women,\r\ndid not fail to recognise her real rank, and to describe as her future\r\nhusband her persevering adorer Redmond Barry, Esquire. This incident\r\ndisturbed her very much. She wrote about it in terms of great wonder\r\nand terror to her female correspondents. \xe2\x80\x98Can this monster,\xe2\x80\x99 she wrote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98indeed do as he boasts, and bend even Fate to his will?--can he make\r\nme marry him though I cordially detest him, and bring me a slave to\r\nhis feet. The horrid look of his black serpent-like eyes fascinates and\r\nfrightens me: it seems to follow me everywhere, and even when I close my\r\nown eyes, the dreadful gaze penetrates the lids, and is still upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen a woman begins to talk of a man in this way, he is an ass who\r\ndoes not win her; and, for my part, I used to follow her about, and put\r\nmyself in an attitude opposite her, \xe2\x80\x98and fascinate her with my glance,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas she said, most assiduously. Lord George Poynings, her former admirer,\r\nwas meanwhile keeping his room with his wound, and seemed determined to\r\ngive up all claims to her favour; for he denied her admittance when she\r\ncalled, sent no answer to her multiplied correspondence, and contented\r\nhimself by saying generally, that the surgeon had forbidden him to\r\nreceive visitors or to answer letters. Thus, while he went into the\r\nbackground, I came forward, and took good care that no other rivals\r\nshould present themselves with any chance of success; for, as soon as I\r\nheard of one, I had a quarrel fastened on him, and, in this way, pinked\r\ntwo more, besides my first victim Lord George. I always took another\r\npretext for quarrelling with them than the real one of attention to\r\nLady Lyndon, so that no scandal or hurt to her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s feelings might\r\narise in consequence; but she very well knew what was the meaning of\r\nthese duels; and the young fellows of Dublin, too, by laying two and two\r\ntogether, began to perceive that there was a certain dragon in watch for\r\nthe wealthy heiress, and that the dragon must be subdued first before\r\nthey could get at the lady. I warrant that, after the first three, not\r\nmany champions were found to address the lady; and have often laughed\r\n(in my sleeve) to see many of the young Dublin beaux riding by the side\r\nof her carriage scamper off as soon as my bay-mare and green liveries\r\nmade their appearance.\r\n\r\nI wanted to impress her with some great and awful instance of my power,\r\nand to this end had determined to confer a great benefit upon my honest\r\ncousin Ulick, and carry off for him the fair object of his affections,\r\nMiss Kiljoy, under the very eyes of her guardian and friend, Lady\r\nLyndon; and in the teeth of the squires, the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s brothers, who\r\npassed the season at Dublin, and made as much swagger and to-do about\r\ntheir sister\xe2\x80\x99s L10,000 Irish, as if she had had a plum to her fortune.\r\nThe girl was by no means averse to Mr. Brady; and it only shows how\r\nfaint-spirited some men are, and how a superior genius can instantly\r\novercome difficulties which to common minds seem insuperable, that he\r\nnever had thought of running off with her: as I at once and boldly did.\r\nMiss Kiljoy had been a ward in Chancery until she attained her majority\r\n(before which period it would have been a dangerous matter for me to\r\nput in execution the scheme I meditated concerning her); but, though now\r\nfree to marry whom she liked, she was a young lady of timid disposition,\r\nand as much under fear of her brothers and relatives as though she had\r\nnot been independent of them. They had some friend of their own in view\r\nfor the young lady, and had scornfully rejected the proposal of Ulick\r\nBrady, the ruined gentleman; who was quite unworthy, as these rustic\r\nbucks thought, of the hand of such a prodigiously wealthy heiress as\r\ntheir sister.\r\n\r\nFinding herself lonely in her great house in Dublin, the Countess of\r\nLyndon invited her friend Miss Amelia to pass the season with her at\r\nDublin; and, in a fit of maternal fondness, also sent for her son the\r\nlittle Bullingdon, and my old acquaintance his governor, to come to\r\nthe capital and bear her company. A family coach brought the boy, the\r\nheiress, and the tutor from Castle Lyndon; and I determined to take the\r\nfirst opportunity of putting my plan in execution.\r\n\r\nFor this chance I had not very long to wait. I have said, in a former\r\nchapter of my biography, that the kingdom of Ireland was at this\r\nperiod ravaged by various parties of banditti; who, under the name\r\nof Whiteboys, Oakboys, Steelboys, with captains at their head, killed\r\nproctors, fired stacks, houghed and maimed cattle, and took the law into\r\ntheir own hands. One of these bands, or several of them for what I know,\r\nwas commanded by a mysterious personage called Captain Thunder; whose\r\nbusiness seemed to be that of marrying people with or without their own\r\nconsent, or that of their parents. The Dublin Gazettes and Mercuries\r\nof that period (the year 1772) teem with proclamations from the Lord\r\nLieutenant, offering rewards for the apprehension of this dreadful\r\nCaptain Thunder and his gang, and describing at length various exploits\r\nof the savage aide-de-camp of Hymen. I determined to make use, if not\r\nof the services, at any rate of the name of Captain Thunder, and put my\r\ncousin Ulick in possession of his lady and her ten thousand pounds. She\r\nwas no great beauty, and, I presume, it was the money he loved rather\r\nthan the owner of it.\r\n\r\nOn account of her widowhood, Lady Lyndon could not as yet frequent the\r\nballs and routs which the hospitable nobility of Dublin were in the\r\ncustom of giving; but her friend Miss Kiljoy had no such cause for\r\nretirement, and was glad to attend any parties to which she might be\r\ninvited. I made Ulick Brady a present of a couple of handsome suits of\r\nvelvet, and by my influence procured him an invitation to many of the\r\nmost elegant of these assemblies. But he had not had my advantages or\r\nexperience of the manners of Court; was as shy with ladies as a young\r\ncolt, and could no more dance a minuet than a donkey. He made very\r\nlittle way in the polite world or in his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s heart: in fact, I\r\ncould see that she preferred several other young gentlemen to him, who\r\nwere more at home in the ball-room than poor Ulick; he had made his\r\nfirst impression upon the heiress, and felt his first flame for her, in\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s house of Ballykiljoy, where he used to hunt and get drunk\r\nwith the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could do THIM two well enough, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 Ulick would say, heaving\r\na sigh; \xe2\x80\x98and if it\xe2\x80\x99s drinking or riding across country would do it,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no man in Ireland would have a better chance with Amalia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never fear, Ulick,\xe2\x80\x99 was my reply; \xe2\x80\x98you shall have your Amalia, or my\r\nname is not Redmond Barry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy Lord Charlemont--who was one of the most elegant and accomplished\r\nnoblemen in Ireland in those days, a fine scholar and wit, a gentleman\r\nwho had travelled much abroad, where I had the honour of knowing\r\nhim--gave a magnificent masquerade at his house of Marino, some\r\nfew miles from Dublin, on the Dunleary road. And it was at this\r\nentertainment that I was determined that Ulick should be made happy for\r\nlife. Miss Kiljoy was invited to the masquerade, and the little Lord\r\nBullingdon, who longed to witness such a scene; and it was agreed that\r\nhe was to go under the guardianship of his governor, my old friend the\r\nReverend Mr. Runt. I learned what was the equipage in which the party\r\nwere to be conveyed to the ball, and took my measures accordingly.\r\n\r\nUlick Brady was not present: his fortune and quality were not sufficient\r\nto procure him an invitation to so distinguished a place, and I had\r\nit given out three days previous that he had been arrested for debt: a\r\nrumour which surprised nobody who knew him.\r\n\r\nI appeared that night in a character with which I was very familiar,\r\nthat of a private soldier in the King of Prussia\xe2\x80\x99s guard. I had a\r\ngrotesque mask made, with an immense nose and moustaches, talked\r\na jumble of broken English and German, in which the latter greatly\r\npredominated; and had crowds round me laughing at my droll accent, and\r\nwhose curiosity was increased by a knowledge of my previous history.\r\nMiss Kiljoy was attired as an antique princess, with little Bullingdon\r\nas a page of the times of chivalry; his hair was in powder, his doublet\r\nrose-colour, and pea-green and silver, and he looked very handsome and\r\nsaucy as he strutted about with my sword by his side. As for Mr. Runt,\r\nhe walked about very demurely in a domino, and perpetually paid his\r\nrespects to the buffet, and ate enough cold chicken and drank enough\r\npunch and champagne to satisfy a company of grenadiers.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Lieutenant came and went in state-the ball was magnificent.\r\nMiss Kiljoy had partners in plenty, among whom was myself, who walked\r\na minuet with her (if the clumsy waddling of the Irish heiress may be\r\ncalled by such a name); and I took occasion to plead my passion for Lady\r\nLyndon in the most pathetic terms, and to beg her friend\xe2\x80\x99s interference\r\nin my favour.\r\n\r\nIt was three hours past midnight when the party for Lyndon House went\r\naway. Little Bullingdon had long since been asleep in one of Lady\r\nCharlemont\xe2\x80\x99s china closets. Mr. Runt was exceedingly husky in talk, and\r\nunsteady in gait. A young lady of the present day would be alarmed to\r\nsee a gentleman in such a condition; but it was a common sight in those\r\njolly old times, when a gentleman was thought a milksop unless he was\r\noccasionally tipsy. I saw Miss Kiljoy to her carriage, with several\r\nother gentlemen: and, peering through the crowd of ragged linkboys,\r\ndrivers, beggars, drunken men and women, who used invariably to wait\r\nround great men\xe2\x80\x99s doors when festivities were going on, saw the carriage\r\ndrive off, with a hurrah from the mob; then came back presently to the\r\nsupper-room, where I talked German, favoured the three or four topers\r\nstill there with a High-Dutch chorus, and attacked the dishes and wine\r\nwith great resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you drink aisy with that big nose on?\xe2\x80\x99 said one gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go an be hangt!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, in the true accent, applying myself again\r\nto the wine; with which the others laughed, and I pursued my supper in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentleman present who had seen the Lyndon party go off, with\r\nwhom I had made a bet, which I lost; and the next morning I called upon\r\nhim and paid it him. All which particulars the reader will be surprised\r\nat hearing enumerated; but the fact is, that it was not I who went back\r\nto the party, but my late German valet, who was of my size, and,\r\ndressed in my mask, could perfectly pass for me. We changed clothes in\r\na hackney-coach that stood near Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s chariot, and driving after\r\nit, speedily overtook it.\r\n\r\nThe fated vehicle which bore the lovely object of Ulick Brady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffections had not advanced very far, when, in the midst of a deep rut\r\nin the road, it came suddenly to with a jolt; the footman, springing off\r\nthe back, cried \xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 to the coachman, warning him that a wheel\r\nwas off, and that it would be dangerous to proceed with only three.\r\nWheel-caps had not been invented in those days, as they have since been\r\nby the ingenious builders of Long Acre. And how the linch-pin of the\r\nwheel had come out I do not pretend to say; but it possibly may have\r\nbeen extracted by some rogues among the crowd before Lord Charlemont\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nMiss Kiljoy thrust her head out of the window, screaming as ladies\r\ndo; Mr. Runt the chaplain woke up from his boozy slumbers; and little\r\nBullingdon, starting up and drawing his little sword, said, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid, Miss Amelia: if it\xe2\x80\x99s footpads, I am armed.\xe2\x80\x99 The young rascal had\r\nthe spirit of a lion, that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth; as I must acknowledge, in spite\r\nof all my after quarrels with him.\r\n\r\nThe hackney-coach which had been following Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s chariot by this\r\ntime came up, and the coachman seeing the disaster, stepped down from\r\nhis box, and politely requested her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s honour to enter his\r\nvehicle; which was as clean and elegant as any person of tiptop quality\r\nmight desire. This invitation was, after a minute or two, accepted by\r\nthe passengers of the chariot: the hackney-coachman promising to drive\r\nthem to Dublin \xe2\x80\x98in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x99 Thady, the valet, proposed to accompany\r\nhis young master and the young lady; and the coachman, who had a friend\r\nseemingly drunk by his side on the box, with a grin told Thady to get\r\nup behind. However, as the footboard there was covered with spikes, as\r\na defence against the street-boys, who love a ride gratis, Thady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfidelity would not induce him to brave these; and he was persuaded\r\nto remain by the wounded chariot, for which he and the coachman\r\nmanufactured a linch-pin out of a neighbouring hedge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, although the hackney-coachman drove on rapidly, yet the party\r\nwithin seemed to consider it was a long distance from Dublin; and what\r\nwas Miss Kiljoy\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, on looking out of the window at length,\r\nto see around her a lonely heath, with no signs of buildings or city.\r\nShe began forthwith to scream out to the coachman to stop; but the man\r\nonly whipped the horses the faster for her noise, and bade her Ladyship\r\n\xe2\x80\x98hould on--\xe2\x80\x98twas a short cut he was taking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Kiljoy continued screaming, the coachman flogging, the horses\r\ngalloping, until two or three men appeared suddenly from a hedge, to\r\nwhom the fair one cried for assistance; and the young Bullingdon opening\r\nthe coach-door, jumped valiantly out, toppling over head and heels as\r\nhe fell; but jumping up in an instant, he drew his little sword, and,\r\nrunning towards the carriage, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98This way, gentlemen! stop the\r\nrascal!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the men; at which the coachman pulled up with\r\nextraordinary obedience. Runt all the while lay tipsy in the carriage,\r\nhaving only a dreamy half-consciousness of all that was going on.\r\n\r\nThe newly arrived champions of female distress now held a consultation,\r\nin which they looked at the young lord and laughed considerably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do not be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x99 said the leader, coming up to the door; \xe2\x80\x98one of my\r\npeople shall mount the box by the side of that treacherous rascal, and,\r\nwith your Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s leave, I and my companions will get in and see you\r\nhome. We are well armed, and can defend you in case of danger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this, and without more ado, he jumped into the carriage, his\r\ncompanion following him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Know your place, fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 cried out little Bullingdon indignantly: \xe2\x80\x98and\r\ngive place to the Lord Viscount Bullingdon!\xe2\x80\x99 and put himself before the\r\nhuge person of the new-comer, who was about to enter the hackney-coach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get out of that, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, in a broad brogue, and shoving\r\nhim aside. On which the boy, crying \xe2\x80\x98Thieves! thieves!\xe2\x80\x99 drew out his\r\nlittle hanger, and ran at the man, and would have wounded him (for a\r\nsmall sword will wound as well as a great one); but his opponent, who\r\nwas armed with a long stick, struck the weapon luckily out of the lad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands: it went flying over his head, and left him aghast and mortified\r\nat his discomfiture.\r\n\r\nHe then pulled off his hat, making his Lordship a low bow, and entered\r\nthe carriage; the door of which was shut upon him by his confederate,\r\nwho was to mount the box. Miss Kiljoy might have screamed; but I presume\r\nher shrieks were stopped by the sight of an enormous horse-pistol which\r\none of her champions produced, who said, \xe2\x80\x98No harm is intended you,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, but if you cry out, we must gag you;\xe2\x80\x99 on which she suddenly\r\nbecame as mute as a fish.\r\n\r\nAll these events took place in an exceedingly short space of time; and\r\nwhen the three invaders had taken possession of the carriage, the poor\r\nlittle Bullingdon being left bewildered and astonished on the heath, one\r\nof them putting his head out of the window, said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Lord, a word with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, beginning to whimper: he was but eleven\r\nyears old, and his courage had been excellent hitherto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are only two miles from Marino. Walk back till you come to a big\r\nstone, there turn to the right, and keep on straight till you get to the\r\nhigh-road, when you will easily find your way back. And when you see her\r\nLadyship your mamma, give CAPTAIN THUNDER\xe2\x80\x99S compliments, and say Miss\r\nAmelia Kiljoy is going to be married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O heavens!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed out that young lady.\r\n\r\nThe carriage drove swiftly on, and the poor little nobleman was left\r\nalone on the heath, just as the morning began to break. He was fairly\r\nfrightened; and no wonder. He thought of running after the coach; but\r\nhis courage and his little legs failed him: so he sat down upon a stone\r\nand cried for vexation.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that Ulick Brady made what I call a Sabine marriage.\r\nWhen he halted with his two groomsmen at the cottage where the ceremony\r\nwas to be performed, Mr. Runt, the chaplain, at first declined to\r\nperform it. But a pistol was held at the head of that unfortunate\r\npreceptor, and he was told, with dreadful oaths, that his miserable\r\nbrains would be blown out; when he consented to read the service. The\r\nlovely Amelia had, very likely, a similar inducement held out to her,\r\nbut of that I know nothing; for I drove back to town with the coachman\r\nas soon as we had set the bridal party down, and had the satisfaction\r\nof finding Fritz, my German, arrived before me: he had come back in my\r\ncarriage in my dress, having left the masquerade undiscovered, and done\r\neverything there according to my orders.\r\n\r\nPoor Runt came back the next day in a piteous plight, keeping silence as\r\nto his share in the occurrences of the evening, and with a dismal story\r\nof having been drunk, of having been waylaid and bound, of having been\r\nleft on the road and picked up by a Wicklow cart, which was coming in\r\nwith provisions to Dublin, and found him helpless on the road. There was\r\nno possible means of fixing any share of the conspiracy upon him. Little\r\nBullingdon, who, too, found his way home, was unable in any way to\r\nidentify me. But Lady Lyndon knew that I was concerned in the plot, for\r\nI met her hurrying the next day to the Castle; all the town being up\r\nabout the enlevement. And I saluted her with a smile so diabolical,\r\nthat I knew she was aware that I had been concerned in the daring and\r\ningenious scheme.\r\n\r\nThus it was that I repaid Ulick Brady\xe2\x80\x99s kindness to me in early days;\r\nand had the satisfaction of restoring the fallen fortunes of a deserving\r\nbranch of my family. He took his bride into Wicklow, where he lived\r\nwith her in the strictest seclusion until the affair was blown over; the\r\nKiljoys striving everywhere in vain to discover his retreat. They did\r\nnot for a while even know who was the lucky man who had carried off\r\nthe heiress; nor was it until she wrote a letter some weeks afterwards,\r\nsigned Amelia Brady, and expressing perfect happiness in her new\r\ncondition, and stating that she had been married by Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchaplain Mr. Runt, that the truth was known, and my worthy friend\r\nconfessed his share of the transaction. As his good-natured mistress\r\ndid not dismiss him from his post in consequence, everybody persisted in\r\nsupposing that poor Lady Lyndon was privy to the plot; and the story of\r\nher Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s passionate attachment for me gained more and more credit.\r\n\r\nI was not slow, you may be sure, in profiting by these rumours. Every\r\none thought I had a share in the Brady marriage; though no one could\r\nprove it. Every one thought I was well with the widowed Countess; though\r\nno one could show that I said so. But there is a way of proving a thing\r\neven while you contradict it, and I used to laugh and joke so apropos\r\nthat all men began to wish me joy of my great fortune, and look up to\r\nme as the affianced husband of the greatest heiress in the kingdom.\r\nThe papers took up the matter; the female friends of Lady Lyndon\r\nremonstrated with her and cried \xe2\x80\x98Fie!\xe2\x80\x99 Even the English journals and\r\nmagazines, which in those days were very scandalous, talked of the\r\nmatter; and whispered that a beautiful and accomplished widow, with\r\na title and the largest possessions in the two kingdoms, was about to\r\nbestow her hand upon a young gentleman of high birth and fashion, who\r\nhad distinguished himself in the service of His M-----y the K--- of\r\nPr----. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say who was the author of these paragraphs; or how\r\ntwo pictures, one representing myself under the title of \xe2\x80\x98The Prussian\r\nIrishman,\xe2\x80\x99 and the other Lady Lyndon as \xe2\x80\x98The Countess of Ephesus,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nactually appeared in the Town and Country Magazine, published at London,\r\nand containing the fashionable tittle-tattle of the day.\r\n\r\nLady Lyndon was so perplexed and terrified by this continual hold upon\r\nher, that she determined to leave the country. Well, she did; and\r\nwho was the first to receive her on landing at Holyhead? Your humble\r\nservant, Redmond Barry, Esquire. And, to crown all, the Dublin Mercury,\r\nwhich announced her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s departure, announced mine THE DAY BEFORE.\r\nThere was not a soul but thought she had followed me to England; whereas\r\nshe was only flying me. Vain hope!--a man of my resolution was not thus\r\nto be balked in pursuit. Had she fled to the antipodes, I would have\r\nbeen there: ay, and would have followed her as far as Orpheus did\r\nEurydice!\r\n\r\nHer Ladyship had a house in Berkeley Square, London, more splendid than\r\nthat which she possessed in Dublin; and, knowing that she would come\r\nthither, I preceded her to the English capital, and took handsome\r\napartments in Hill Street, hard by. I had the same intelligence in her\r\nLondon house which I had procured in Dublin. The same faithful porter\r\nwas there to give me all the information I required. I promised to\r\ntreble his wages as soon as a certain event should happen. I won over\r\nLady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s companion by a present of a hundred guineas down, and a\r\npromise of two thousand when I should be married, and gained the\r\nfavours of her favourite lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid by a bribe of similar magnitude. My\r\nreputation had so far preceded me in London that, on my arrival, numbers\r\nof the genteel were eager to receive me at their routs. We have no idea\r\nin this humdrum age what a gay and splendid place London was then: what\r\na passion for play there was among young and old, male and female; what\r\nthousands were lost and won in a night; what beauties there were--how\r\nbrilliant, gay, and dashing! Everybody was delightfully wicked: the\r\nRoyal Dukes of Gloucester and Cumberland set the example; the nobles\r\nfollowed close behind. Running away was the fashion. Ah! it was a\r\npleasant time; and lucky was he who had fire, and youth, and money, and\r\ncould live in it! I had all these; and the old frequenters of \xe2\x80\x98White\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wattier\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Goosetree\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 could tell stories of the gallantry,\r\nspirit, and high fashion of Captain Barry.\r\n\r\nThe progress of a love-story is tedious to all those who are not\r\nconcerned, and I leave such themes to the hack novel-writers, and the\r\nyoung boarding-school misses for whom they write. It is not my intention\r\nto follow, step by step, the incidents of my courtship, or to narrate\r\nall the difficulties I had to contend with, and my triumphant manner of\r\nsurmounting them. Suffice it to say, I DID overcome these difficulties.\r\nI am of opinion, with my friend the late ingenious Mr. Wilkes, that such\r\nimpediments are nothing in the way of a man of spirit; and that he can\r\nconvert indifference and aversion into love, if he have perseverance and\r\ncleverness sufficient. By the time the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s widowhood was expired,\r\nI had found means to be received into her house; I had her women\r\nperpetually talking in my favour, vaunting my powers, expatiating\r\nupon my reputation, and boasting of my success and popularity in the\r\nfashionable world.\r\n\r\nAlso, the best friends I had in the prosecution of my tender suit were\r\nthe Countess\xe2\x80\x99s noble relatives; who were far from knowing the service\r\nthat they did me, and to whom I beg leave to tender my heartfelt thanks\r\nfor the abuse with which they then loaded me! and to whom I fling\r\nmy utter contempt for the calumny and hatred with which they have\r\nsubsequently pursued me.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these amiable persons was the Marchioness of Tiptoff,\r\nmother of the young gentleman whose audacity I had punished at Dublin.\r\nThis old harridan, on the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s first arrival in London,\r\nwaited upon her, and favoured her with such a storm of abuse for her\r\nencouragement of me, that I do believe she advanced my cause more than\r\nsix months\xe2\x80\x99 courtship could have done, or the pinking of a half-dozen\r\nof rivals. It was in vain that poor Lady Lyndon pleaded her entire\r\ninnocence and vowed she had never encouraged me. \xe2\x80\x98Never encouraged him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nscreamed out the old fury; \xe2\x80\x98didn\xe2\x80\x99t you encourage the wretch at Spa,\r\nduring Sir Charles\xe2\x80\x99s own life? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you marry a dependant of yours to\r\none of this profligate\xe2\x80\x99s bankrupt cousins? When he set off for England,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you follow him like a mad woman the very next day? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\ntake lodgings at your very door almost--and do you call this no\r\nencouragement? For shame, madam, shame! You might have married my\r\nson--my dear and noble George; but that he did not choose to interfere\r\nwith your shameful passion for the beggarly upstart whom you caused to\r\nassassinate him; and the only counsel I have to give your Ladyship\r\nis this, to legitimatise the ties which you have contracted with this\r\nshameless adventurer; to make that connection legal which, real as it is\r\nnow, is against both decency and religion; and to spare your family and\r\nyour son the shame of your present line of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this the old fury of a marchioness left the room, and Lady Lyndon\r\nin tears: I had the whole particulars of the conversation from her\r\nLadyship\xe2\x80\x99s companion, and augured the best result from it in my favour.\r\n\r\nThus, by the sage influence of my Lady Tiptoff, the Countess of Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnatural friends and family were kept from her society. Even when Lady\r\nLyndon went to Court the most august lady in the realm received her with\r\nsuch marked coldness, that the unfortunate widow came home and took to\r\nher bed with vexation. And thus I may say that Royalty itself became\r\nan agent in advancing my suit, and helping the plans of the poor Irish\r\nsoldier of fortune. So it is that Fate works with agents, great and\r\nsmall; and by means over which they have no control the destinies of men\r\nand women are accomplished.\r\n\r\nI shall always consider the conduct of Mrs. Bridget (Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite maid at this juncture) as a masterpiece of ingenuity: and,\r\nindeed, had such an opinion of her diplomatic skill, that the very\r\ninstant I became master of the Lyndon estates, and paid her the promised\r\nsum--I am a man of honour, and rather than not keep my word with the\r\nwoman, I raised the money of the Jews, at an exorbitant interest--as\r\nsoon, I say, as I achieved my triumph, I took Mrs. Bridget by the hand,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cMadam, you have shown such unexampled fidelity in my service\r\nthat I am glad to reward you, according to my promise; but you have\r\ngiven proofs of such extraordinary cleverness and dissimulation, that\r\nI must decline keeping you in Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, and beg\r\nyou will leave it this very day:\xe2\x80\x9d which she did, and went over to the\r\nTiptoff faction, and has abused me ever since.\r\n\r\nBut I must tell you what she did which was so clever. Why, it was the\r\nsimplest thing in the world, as all master-strokes are. When Lady\r\nLyndon lamented her fate and my--as she was pleased to call it--shameful\r\ntreatment of her, Mrs. Bridget said, \xe2\x80\x98Why should not your Ladyship write\r\nthis young gentleman word of the evil which he is causing you? Appeal to\r\nhis feelings (which, I have heard say, are very good indeed--the whole\r\ntown is ringing with accounts of his spirit and generosity), and beg him\r\nto desist from a pursuit which causes the best of ladies so much pain?\r\nDo, my Lady, write: I know your style is so elegant that I, for my part,\r\nhave many a time burst into tears in reading your charming letters, and\r\nI have no doubt Mr. Barry will sacrifice anything rather than hurt your\r\nfeelings.\xe2\x80\x99 And, of course, the abigail swore to the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so, Bridget?\xe2\x80\x99 said her Ladyship. And my mistress forthwith\r\npenned me a letter, in her most fascinating and winning manner:--\xe2\x80\x98Why,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote she, \xe2\x80\x98will you pursue me? why environ me in a web of\r\nintrigue so frightful that my spirit sinks under it, seeing escape is\r\nhopeless from your frightful, your diabolical art? They say you are\r\ngenerous to others--be so to me. I know your bravery but too well:\r\nexercise it on men who can meet your sword, not on a poor feeble woman,\r\nwho cannot resist you. Remember the friendship you once professed\r\nfor me. And now, I beseech you, I implore you, to give a proof of it.\r\nContradict the calumnies which you have spread against me, and repair,\r\nif you can, and if you have a spark of honour left, the miseries which\r\nyou have caused to the heart-broken\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H. LYNDON.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was this letter meant for but that I should answer it in person? My\r\nexcellent ally told me where I should meet Lady Lyndon, and accordingly\r\nI followed, and found her at the Pantheon. I repeated the scene at\r\nDublin over again; showed her how prodigious my power was, humble as\r\nI was, and that my energy was still untired. \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 I added, \xe2\x80\x98I am as\r\ngreat in good as I am in evil; as fond and faithful as a friend as I am\r\nterrible as an enemy. I will do everything,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98which you ask of\r\nme, except when you bid me not to love you. That is beyond my power; and\r\nwhile my heart has a pulse I must follow you. It is MY fate; your fate.\r\nCease to battle against it, and be mine. Loveliest of your sex! with\r\nlife alone can end my passion for you; and, indeed, it is only by dying\r\nat your command that I can be brought to obey you. Do you wish me to\r\ndie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said, laughing (for she was a woman of a lively, humorous turn),\r\nthat she did not wish me to commit self-murder; and I felt from that\r\nmoment that she was mine.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nA year from that day, on the 15th of May, in the year 1773, I had the\r\nhonour and happiness to lead to the altar Honoria, Countess of Lyndon,\r\nwidow of the late Right Honourable Sir Charles Lyndon, K.B. The ceremony\r\nwas performed at St. George\xe2\x80\x99s, Hanover Square, by the Reverend Samuel\r\nRunt, her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s chaplain. A magnificent supper and ball was given\r\nat our house in Berkeley Square, and the next morning I had a duke, four\r\nearls, three generals, and a crowd of the most distinguished people\r\nin London at my LEVEE. Walpole made a lampoon about the marriage, and\r\nSelwyn cut jokes at the \xe2\x80\x98Cocoa-Tree.\xe2\x80\x99 Old Lady Tiptoff, although she had\r\nrecommended it, was ready to bite off her fingers with vexation; and as\r\nfor young Bullingdon, who was grown a tall lad of fourteen, when called\r\nupon by the Countess to embrace his papa, he shook his fist in my face\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98HE my father! I would as soon call one of your Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootmen Papa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut I could afford to laugh at the rage of the boy and the old woman,\r\nand at the jokes of the wits of St. James\xe2\x80\x99s. I sent off a flaming\r\naccount of our nuptials to my mother and my uncle the good Chevalier;\r\nand now, arrived at the pitch of prosperity, and having, at thirty years\r\nof age, by my own merits and energy, raised myself to one of the highest\r\nsocial positions that any man in England could occupy, I determined to\r\nenjoy myself as became a man of quality for the remainder of my life.\r\n\r\nAfter we had received the congratulations of our friends in London--for\r\nin those days people were not ashamed of being married, as they seem\r\nto be now--I and Honoria (who was all complacency, and a most handsome,\r\nsprightly, and agreeable companion) set off to visit our estates in the\r\nWest of England, where I had never as yet set foot. We left London in\r\nthree chariots, each with four horses; and my uncle would have been\r\npleased could he have seen painted on their panels the Irish crown and\r\nthe ancient coat of the Barrys beside the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s coronet and the\r\nnoble cognisance of the noble family of Lyndon.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting London, I procured His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s gracious permission to\r\nadd the name of my lovely lady to my own; and henceforward assumed\r\nthe style and title of BARRY LYNDON, as I have written it in this\r\nautobiography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. I APPEAR AS AN ORNAMENT OF ENGLISH SOCIETY\r\n\r\nAll the journey down to Hackton Castle, the largest and most ancient of\r\nour ancestral seats in Devonshire, was performed with the slow and sober\r\nstate becoming people of the first quality in the realm. An outrider in\r\nmy livery went on before us, and bespoke our lodging from town to town;\r\nand thus we lay in state at Andover, Ilminster, and Exeter; and the\r\nfourth evening arrived in time for supper before the antique baronial\r\nmansion, of which the gate was in an odious Gothic taste that would have\r\nset Mr. Walpole wild with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe first days of a marriage are commonly very trying; and I have known\r\ncouples, who lived together like turtle-doves for the rest of their\r\nlives, peck each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes out almost during the honeymoon. I did not\r\nescape the common lot; in our journey westward my Lady Lyndon chose to\r\nquarrel with me because I pulled out a pipe of tobacco (the habit of\r\nsmoking which I had acquired in Germany when a soldier in Billow\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\ncould never give it over), and smoked it in the carriage; and also her\r\nLadyship chose to take umbrage both at Ilminster and Andover, because\r\nin the evenings when we lay there I chose to invite the landlords of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Bell\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Lion\xe2\x80\x99 to crack a bottle with me. Lady Lyndon was\r\na haughty woman, and I hate pride; and I promise you that in both\r\ninstances I overcame this vice in her. On the third day of our journey\r\nI had her to light my pipematch with her own hands, and made her deliver\r\nit to me with tears in her eyes; and at the \xe2\x80\x98Swan Inn\xe2\x80\x99 at Exeter I had\r\nso completely subdued her, that she asked me humbly whether I would not\r\nwish the landlady as well as the host to step up to dinner with us. To\r\nthis I should have had no objection, for, indeed, Mrs. Bonnyface was a\r\nvery good-looking woman; but we expected a visit from my Lord Bishop,\r\na kinsman of Lady Lyndon, and the BIENSEANCES did not permit the\r\nindulgence of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s request. I appeared with her at evening service,\r\nto compliment our right reverend cousin, and put her name down for\r\ntwenty-five guineas, and my own for one hundred, to the famous new organ\r\nwhich was then being built for the cathedral. This conduct, at the very\r\noutset of my career in the county, made me not a little popular; and\r\nthe residentiary canon, who did me the favour to sup with me at the inn,\r\nwent away after the sixth bottle, hiccuping the most solemn vows for the\r\nwelfare of such a p-p-pious gentleman.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached Hackton Castle, we had to drive through ten miles of\r\nthe Lyndon estates, where the people were out to visit us, the church\r\nbells set a-ringing, the parson and the farmers assembled in their best\r\nby the roadside, and the school children and the labouring people were\r\nloud in their hurrahs for her Ladyship. I flung money among these worthy\r\ncharacters, stopped to bow and chat with his reverence and the farmers,\r\nand if I found that the Devonshire girls were among the handsomest in\r\nthe kingdom is it my fault? These remarks my Lady Lyndon especially\r\nwould take in great dudgeon; and I do believe she was made more angry by\r\nmy admiration of the red cheeks of Miss Betsy Quarringdon of Clumpton,\r\nthan by any previous speech or act of mine in the journey. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, ah, my\r\nfine madam, you are jealous, are you?\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, and reflected, not\r\nwithout deep sorrow, how lightly she herself had acted in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlifetime, and that those are most jealous who themselves give most cause\r\nfor jealousy.\r\n\r\nRound Hackton village the scene of welcome was particularly gay: a band\r\nof music had been brought from Plymouth, and arches and flags had been\r\nraised, especially before the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s and the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s houses, who\r\nwere both in the employ of the family. There were many hundreds of stout\r\npeople at the great lodge, which, with the park-wall, bounds one side of\r\nHackton Green, and from which, for three miles, goes (or rather went) an\r\navenue of noble elms up to the towers of the old castle. I wished they\r\nhad been oak when I cut the trees down in \xe2\x80\x9879, for they would have\r\nfetched three times the money: I know nothing more culpable than the\r\ncarelessness of ancestors in planting their grounds with timber of small\r\nvalue, when they might just as easily raise oak. Thus I have always said\r\nthat the Roundhead Lyndon of Hackton, who planted these elms in Charles\r\nII.\xe2\x80\x99s time, cheated me of ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days after our arrival, my time was agreeably spent\r\nin receiving the visits of the nobility and gentry who came to pay their\r\nrespects to the noble new-married couple, and, like Bluebeard\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nin the fairy tale, in inspecting the treasures, the furniture, and the\r\nnumerous chambers of the castle. It is a huge old place, built as far\r\nback as Henry V.\xe2\x80\x99s time, besieged and battered by the Cromwellians in\r\nthe Revolution, and altered and patched up, in an odious old-fashioned\r\ntaste, by the Roundhead Lyndon, who succeeded to the property at the\r\ndeath of a brother whose principles were excellent and of the true\r\nCavalier sort, but who ruined himself chiefly by drinking, dicing, and\r\na dissolute life, and a little by supporting the King. The castle stands\r\nin a fine chase, which was prettily speckled over with deer; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbut own that my pleasure was considerable at first, as I sat in the oak\r\nparlour of summer evenings, with the windows open, the gold and silver\r\nplate shining in a hundred dazzling colours on the side-boards, a dozen\r\njolly companions round the table, and could look out over the wide green\r\npark and the waving woods, and see the sun setting on the lake, and hear\r\nthe deer calling to one another.\r\n\r\nThe exterior was, when I first arrived, a quaint composition of all\r\nsorts of architecture; of feudal towers, and gable-ends in Queen Bess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstyle, and rough-patched walls built up to repair the ravages of the\r\nRoundhead cannon: but I need not speak of this at large, having had the\r\nplace new-faced at a vast expense, under a fashionable architect, and\r\nthe facade laid out in the latest French-Greek and most classical style.\r\nThere had been moats, and drawbridges, and outer walls; these I had\r\nshaved away into elegant terraces, and handsomely laid out in parterres\r\naccording to the plans of Monsieur Cornichon, the great Parisian\r\narchitect, who visited England for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter ascending the outer steps, you entered an antique hall of vast\r\ndimensions, wainscoted with black carved oak, and ornamented with\r\nportraits of our ancestors: from the square beard of Brook Lyndon, the\r\ngreat lawyer in Queen Bess\xe2\x80\x99s time, to the loose stomacher and ringlets\r\nof Lady Saccharissa Lyndon, whom Vandyck painted when she was a maid of\r\nhonour to Queen Henrietta Maria, and down to Sir Charles Lyndon, with\r\nhis riband as a knight of the Bath; and my Lady, painted by Hudson, in\r\na white satin sack and the family diamonds, as she was presented to\r\nthe old King George II. These diamonds were very fine: I first had\r\nthem reset by Boehmer when we appeared before their French Majesties at\r\nVersailles; and finally raised L18,000 upon them, after that infernal\r\nrun of ill luck at \xe2\x80\x98Goosetree\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 when Jemmy Twitcher (as we called\r\nmy Lord Sandwich), Carlisle, Charley Fox, and I played hombre for\r\nfour-and-forty hours SANS DESEMPARER. Bows and pikes, huge stag-heads\r\nand hunting implements, and rusty old suits of armour, that may have\r\nbeen worn in the days of Gog and Magog for what I know, formed the other\r\nold ornaments of this huge apartment; and were ranged round a fireplace\r\nwhere you might have turned a coach-and-six. This I kept pretty much in\r\nits antique condition, but had the old armour eventually turned out\r\nand consigned to the lumber-rooms upstairs; replacing it with china\r\nmonsters, gilded settees from France, and elegant marbles, of which the\r\nbroken noses and limbs, and ugliness, undeniably proved their antiquity:\r\nand which an agent purchased for me at Rome. But such was the taste\r\nof the times (and, perhaps, the rascality of my agent), that thirty\r\nthousand pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of these gems of art only went for three hundred\r\nguineas at a subsequent period, when I found it necessary to raise money\r\non my collections.\r\n\r\nFrom this main hall branched off on either side the long series of\r\nstate-rooms, poorly furnished with high-backed chairs and long queer\r\nVenice glasses, when first I came to the property; but afterwards\r\nrendered so splendid by me, with the gold damasks of Lyons and the\r\nmagnificent Gobelin tapestries I won from Richelieu at play. There\r\nwere thirty-six bedrooms DE MAITRE, of which I only kept three in their\r\nantique condition,--the haunted room as it was called, where the murder\r\nwas done in James II.\xe2\x80\x99s time, the bed where William slept after\r\nlanding at Torbay, and Queen Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s state-room. All the rest were\r\nredecorated by Cornichon in the most elegant taste; not a little to the\r\nscandal of some of the steady old country dowagers; for I had pictures\r\nof Boucher and Vanloo to decorate the principal apartments, in which the\r\nCupids and Venuses were painted in a manner so natural, that I recollect\r\nthe old wizened Countess of Frumpington pinning over the curtains of her\r\nbed, and sending her daughter, Lady Blanche Whalebone, to sleep with her\r\nwaiting-woman, rather than allow her to lie in a chamber hung all over\r\nwith looking-glasses, after the exact fashion of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s closet at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nFor many of these ornaments I was not so much answerable as Cornichon,\r\nwhom Lauraguais lent me, and who was the intendant of my buildings\r\nduring my absence abroad. I had given the man CARTE BLANCHE, and when he\r\nfell down and broke his leg, as he was decorating a theatre in the room\r\nwhich had been the old chapel of the castle, the people of the\r\ncountry thought it was a judgment of Heaven upon him. In his rage for\r\nimprovement the fellow dared anything. Without my orders he cut down\r\nan old rookery which was sacred in the country, and had a prophecy\r\nregarding it, stating, \xe2\x80\x98When the rook-wood shall fall, down goes Hackton\r\nHall.\xe2\x80\x99 The rooks went over and colonised Tiptoff Woods, which lay near\r\nus (and be hanged to them!), and Cornichon built a temple to Venus and\r\ntwo lovely fountains on their site. Venuses and Cupids were the rascal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadoration: he wanted to take down the Gothic screen and place Cupids in\r\nour pew there; but old Doctor Huff the rector came out with a large oak\r\nstick, and addressed the unlucky architect in Latin, of which he did not\r\ncomprehend a word, yet made him understand that he would break his\r\nbones if he laid a single finger upon the sacred edifice. Cornichon\r\nmade complaints about the \xe2\x80\x98Abbe Huff,\xe2\x80\x99 as he called him. [\xe2\x80\x98Et quel abbe,\r\ngrand Dieu!\xe2\x80\x99 added he, quite bewildered, \xe2\x80\x98un abbe avec douze enfans\xe2\x80\x99);\r\nbut I encouraged the Church in this respect, and bade Cornichon exert\r\nhis talents only in the castle.\r\n\r\nThere was a magnificent collection of ancient plate, to which I added\r\nmuch of the most splendid modern kind; a cellar which, however well\r\nfurnished, required continual replenishing, and a kitchen which I\r\nreformed altogether. My friend, Jack Wilkes, sent me down a cook from\r\nthe Mansion House, for the English cookery,--the turtle and venison\r\ndepartment: I had a CHEF (who called out the Englishman, by the way, and\r\ncomplained sadly of the GROS COCHON who wanted to meet him with COUPS DE\r\nPOING) and a couple of AIDES from Paris, and an Italian confectioner,\r\nas my OFFICIERS DE BOUCHE. All which natural appendages to a man of\r\nfashion, the odious, stingy old Tiptoff, my kinsman and neighbour,\r\naffected to view with horror; and he spread through the country a report\r\nthat I had my victuals cooked by Papists, lived upon frogs, and, he\r\nverily believed, fricasseed little children.\r\n\r\nBut the squires ate my dinners very readily for all that, and old Doctor\r\nHuff himself was compelled to allow that my venison and turtle were\r\nmost orthodox. The former gentry I knew how to conciliate, too, in\r\nother ways. There had been only a subscription pack of fox-hounds in\r\nthe county and a few beggarly couples of mangy beagles, with which old\r\nTiptoff pattered about his grounds; I built a kennel and stables,\r\nwhich cost L30,000, and stocked them in a manner which was worthy of\r\nmy ancestors, the Irish kings. I had two packs of hounds, and took\r\nthe field in the season four times a week, with three gentlemen in\r\nmy hunt-uniform to follow me, and open house at Hackton for all who\r\nbelonged to the hunt.\r\n\r\nThese changes and this train de vivre required, as may be supposed, no\r\nsmall outlay; and I confess that I have little of that base spirit of\r\neconomy in my composition which some people practise and admire. For\r\ninstance, old Tiptoff was hoarding up his money to repair his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextravagance and disencumber his estates; a good deal of the money\r\nwith which he paid off his mortgages my agent procured upon mine. And,\r\nbesides, it must be remembered I had only a life-interest upon the\r\nLyndon property, was always of an easy temper in dealing with the\r\nmoney-brokers, and had to pay heavily for insuring her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a year Lady Lyndon presented me with a son--Bryan Lyndon\r\nI called him, in compliment to my royal ancestry: but what more had I to\r\nleave him than a noble name? Was not the estate of his mother entailed\r\nupon the odious little Turk, Lord Bullingdon? and whom, by the way, I\r\nhave not mentioned as yet, though he was living at Hackton, consigned to\r\na new governor. The insubordination of that boy was dreadful. He used\r\nto quote passages of \xe2\x80\x98Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99 to his mother, which made her very angry.\r\nOnce when I took a horsewhip to chastise him, he drew a knife, and would\r\nhave stabbed me: and, \xe2\x80\x98faith, I recollected my own youth, which was\r\npretty similar; and, holding out my hand, burst out laughing, and\r\nproposed to him to be friends. We were reconciled for that time, and\r\nthe next, and the next; but there was no love lost between us, and his\r\nhatred for me seemed to grow as he grew, which was apace.\r\n\r\nI determined to endow my darling boy Bryan with a property, and to this\r\nend cut down twelve thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of timber on Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nYorkshire and Irish estates: at which proceeding Bullingdon\xe2\x80\x99s guardian,\r\nTiptoff, cried out, as usual, and swore I had no right to touch a\r\nstick of the trees; but down they went; and I commissioned my mother to\r\nrepurchase the ancient lands of Ballybarry and Barryogue, which had once\r\nformed part of the immense possessions of my house. These she bought\r\nback with excellent prudence and extreme joy; for her heart was\r\ngladdened at the idea that a son was born to my name, and with the\r\nnotion of my magnificent fortunes.\r\n\r\nTo say truth, I was rather afraid, now that I lived in a very different\r\nsphere from that in which she was accustomed to move, lest she should\r\ncome to pay me a visit, and astonish my English friends by her bragging\r\nand her brogue, her rouge and her old hoops and furbelows of the time\r\nof George II.: in which she had figured advantageously in her youth, and\r\nwhich she still fondly thought to be at the height of the fashion. So\r\nI wrote to her, putting off her visit; begging her to visit us when\r\nthe left wing of the castle was finished, or the stables built, and so\r\nforth. There was no need of such precaution. \xe2\x80\x98A hint\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me,\r\nRedmond,\xe2\x80\x99 the old lady would reply. \xe2\x80\x98I am not coming to disturb you\r\namong your great English friends with my old-fashioned Irish ways. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na blessing to me to think that my darling boy has attained the position\r\nwhich I always knew was his due, and for which I pinched myself to\r\neducate him. You must bring me the little Bryan, that his grandmother\r\nmay kiss him, one day. Present my respectful blessing to her Ladyship\r\nhis mamma. Tell her she has got a treasure in her husband, which she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had had she taken a duke to marry her; and that the Barrys\r\nand the Bradys, though without titles, have the best of blood in their\r\nveins. I shall never rest until I see you Earl of Ballybarry, and my\r\ngrandson Lord Viscount Barryogue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHow singular it was that the very same ideas should be passing in my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s mind and my own! The very title she had pitched upon had also\r\nbeen selected (naturally enough) by me; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind confessing that\r\nI had filled a dozen sheets of paper with my signature, under the\r\nnames of Ballybarry and Barryogue, and had determined with my usual\r\nimpetuosity to carry my point. My mother went and established herself\r\nat Ballybarry, living with the priest there until a tenement could be\r\nerected, and dating from \xe2\x80\x98Ballybarry Castle;\xe2\x80\x99 which, you may be sure,\r\nI gave out to be a place of no small importance. I had a plan of the\r\nestate in my study, both at Hackton and in Berkeley Square, and the\r\nplans of the elevation of Ballybarry Castle, the ancestral residence of\r\nBarry Lyndon, Esq., with the projected improvements, in which the castle\r\nwas represented as about the size of Windsor, with more ornaments to\r\nthe architecture; and eight hundred acres of bog falling in handy, I\r\npurchased them at three pounds an acre, so that my estate upon the map\r\nlooked to be no insignificant one. [Footnote: On the strength of this\r\nestate, and pledging his honour that it was not mortgaged, Mr. Barry\r\nLyndon borrowed L17,000 in the year 1786, from young Captain Pigeon, the\r\ncity merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son, who had just come in for his property. At for the\r\nPolwellan estate and mines, \xe2\x80\x98the cause of endless litigation,\xe2\x80\x99 it must\r\nbe owned that our hero purchased them; but he never paid more than the\r\nfirst L5000 of the purchase-money. Hence the litigation of which he\r\ncomplains, and the famous Chancery suit of \xe2\x80\x98Trecothick v. Lyndon,\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nwhich Mr. John Scott greatly distinguished himself.-ED.]\r\n\r\nI also in this year made arrangements for purchasing the Polwellan\r\nestate and mines in Cornwall from Sir John Trecothick, for L70,000--an\r\nimprudent bargain, which was afterwards the cause to me of much dispute\r\nand litigation. The troubles of property, the rascality of agents, the\r\nquibbles of lawyers, are endless. Humble people envy us great men, and\r\nfancy that our lives are all pleasure. Many a time in the course of my\r\nprosperity I have sighed for the days of my meanest fortune, and envied\r\nthe boon companions at my table, with no clothes to their backs but\r\nsuch as my credit supplied them, without a guinea but what came from\r\nmy pocket; but without one of the harassing cares and responsibilities\r\nwhich are the dismal adjuncts of great rank and property.\r\n\r\nI did little more than make my appearance, and assume the command of my\r\nestates, in the kingdom of Ireland; rewarding generously those persons\r\nwho had been kind to me in my former adversities, and taking my fitting\r\nplace among the aristocracy of the land. But, in truth, I had small\r\ninducements to remain in it after having tasted of the genteeler and\r\nmore complete pleasures of English and Continental life; and we passed\r\nour summers at Buxton, Bath, and Harrogate, while Hackton Castle was\r\nbeing beautified in the elegant manner already described by me, and the\r\nseason at our mansion in Berkeley Square.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how the possession of wealth brings out the virtues of\r\na man; or, at any rate, acts as a varnish or lustre to them, and\r\nbrings out their brilliancy and colour in a manner never known when the\r\nindividual stood in the cold grey atmosphere of poverty. I assure you it\r\nwas a very short time before I was a pretty fellow of the first class;\r\nmade no small sensation at the coffee-houses in Pall Mall and\r\nafterwards at the most famous clubs. My style, equipages, and elegant\r\nentertainments were in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and were described in all the\r\nmorning prints. The needier part of Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, and such as\r\nhad been offended by the intolerable pomposity of old Tiptoff, began to\r\nappear at our routs and assemblies; and as for relations of my own, I\r\nfound in London and Ireland more than I had ever dreamed of, of cousins\r\nwho claimed affinity with me. There were, of course, natives of my own\r\ncountry (of which I was not particularly proud), and I received visits\r\nfrom three or four swaggering shabby Temple bucks, with tarnished lace\r\nand Tipperary brogue, who were eating their way to the bar in London;\r\nfrom several gambling adventurers at the watering-places, whom I soon\r\nspeedily let to know their place; and from others of more reputable\r\ncondition. Among them I may mention my cousin the Lord Kilbarry, who, on\r\nthe score of his relationship, borrowed thirty pieces from me to pay his\r\nlandlady in Swallow Street; and whom, for my own reasons, I allowed to\r\nmaintain and credit a connection for which the Heralds\xe2\x80\x99 College gave no\r\nauthority whatsoever. Kilbarry had a cover at my table; punted at play,\r\nand paid when he liked, which was seldom; had an intimacy with, and was\r\nunder considerable obligations to, my tailor; and always boasted of his\r\ncousin the great Barry Lyndon of the West country.\r\n\r\nHer Ladyship and I lived, after a while, pretty separate when in London.\r\nShe preferred quiet: or to say the truth, I preferred it; being a great\r\nfriend to a modest tranquil behaviour in woman, and a taste for the\r\ndomestic pleasures. Hence I encouraged her to dine at home with her\r\nladies, her chaplain, and a few of her friends; admitted three or four\r\nproper and discreet persons to accompany her to her box at the opera or\r\nplay on proper occasions; and indeed declined for her the too frequent\r\nvisits of her friends and family, preferring to receive them only twice\r\nor thrice in a season on our grand reception days. Besides, she was a\r\nmother, and had great comfort in the dressing, educating, and dandling\r\nour little Bryan, for whose sake it was fit that she should give up the\r\npleasures and frivolities of the world; so she left THAT part of the\r\nduty of every family of distinction to be performed by me. To say the\r\ntruth, Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s figure and appearance were not at this time such as\r\nto make for their owner any very brilliant appearance in the fashionable\r\nworld. She had grown very fat, was short-sighted, pale in complexion,\r\ncareless about her dress, dull in demeanour; her conversations with\r\nme characterised by a stupid despair, or a silly blundering attempt at\r\nforced cheerfulness still more disagreeable: hence our intercourse was\r\nbut trifling, and my temptations to carry her into the world, or to\r\nremain in her society, of necessity exceedingly small. She would try my\r\ntemper at home, too, in a thousand ways. When requested by me (often,\r\nI own, rather roughly) to entertain the company with conversation, wit,\r\nand learning, of which she was a mistress: or music, of which she was\r\nan accomplished performer, she would as often as not begin to cry, and\r\nleave the room. My company from this, of course, fancied I was a tyrant\r\nover her; whereas I was only a severe and careful guardian over a silly,\r\nbad-tempered, and weak-minded lady.\r\n\r\nShe was luckily very fond of her youngest son, and through him I had a\r\nwholesome and effectual hold of her; for if in any of her tantrums or\r\nfits of haughtiness--(this woman was intolerably proud; and repeatedly,\r\nat first, in our quarrels, dared to twit me with my own original poverty\r\nand low birth),--if, I say, in our disputes she pretended to have the\r\nupper hand, to assert her authority against mine, to refuse to sign such\r\npapers as I might think necessary for the distribution of our large and\r\ncomplicated property, I would have Master Bryan carried off to Chiswick\r\nfor a couple of days; and I warrant me his lady-mother could hold out\r\nno longer, and would agree to anything I chose to propose. The servants\r\nabout her I took care should be in my pay, not hers: especially the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s head nurse was under MY orders, not those of my lady; and a very\r\nhandsome, red-cheeked, impudent jade she was; and a great fool she made\r\nme make of myself. This woman was more mistress of the house than the\r\npoor-spirited lady who owned it. She gave the law to the servants; and\r\nif I showed any particular attention to any of the ladies who visited\r\nus, the slut would not scruple to show her jealousy, and to find means\r\nto send them packing. The fact is, a generous man is always made a fool\r\nof by some woman or other, and this one had such an influence over me\r\nthat she could turn me round her finger. [Footnote: From these curious\r\nconfessions, it would appear that Mr. Lyndon maltreated his lady in\r\nevery possible way; that he denied her society, bullied her into\r\nsigning away her property, spent it in gambling and taverns, was openly\r\nunfaithful to her; and, when she complained, threatened to remove her\r\nchildren from her. Nor, indeed, is he the only husband who has done\r\nthe like, and has passed for \xe2\x80\x98nobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemy but his own:\xe2\x80\x99 a jovial\r\ngood-natured fellow. The world contains scores of such amiable people;\r\nand, indeed, it is because justice has not been done them that we\r\nhave edited this autobiography. Had it been that of a mere hero of\r\nromance--one of those heroic youths who figure in the novels of Scott\r\nand James--there would have been no call to introduce the reader to a\r\npersonage already so often and so charmingly depicted. Mr. Barry Lyndon\r\nis not, we repeat, a hero of the common pattern; but let the reader look\r\nround, and ask himself, Do not as many rogues succeed in life as honest\r\nmen? more fools than men of talent? And is it not just that the lives of\r\nthis class should be described by the student of human nature as well\r\nas the actions of those fairy-tale princes, those perfect impossible\r\nheroes, whom our writers love to describe? There is something naive\r\nand simple in that time-honoured style of novel-writing by which Prince\r\nPrettyman, at the end of his adventures, is put in possession of every\r\nworldly prosperity, as he has been endowed with every mental and bodily\r\nexcellence previously. The novelist thinks that he can do no more for\r\nhis darling hero than make him a lord. Is it not a poor standard that,\r\nof the summum bonum? The greatest good in life is not to be a lord;\r\nperhaps not even to be happy. Poverty, illness, a humpback, may be\r\nrewards and conditions of good, as well as that bodily prosperity which\r\nall of us unconsciously set up for worship. But this is a subject for\r\nan essay, not a note; and it is best to allow Mr. Lyndon to resume the\r\ncandid and ingenious narrative of his virtues and defects.]\r\n\r\nHer infernal temper (Mrs. Stammer was the jade\xe2\x80\x99s name) and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoody despondency, made my house and home not over-pleasant: hence I was\r\ndriven a good deal abroad, where, as play was the fashion at every club,\r\ntavern, and assembly, I, of course, was obliged to resume my old habit,\r\nand to commence as an amateur those games at which I was once unrivalled\r\nin Europe. But whether a man\xe2\x80\x99s temper changes with prosperity, or his\r\nskill leaves him when, deprived of a confederate, and pursuing the game\r\nno longer professionally, he joins in it, like the rest of the world,\r\nfor pastime, I know not; but certain it is, that in the seasons of\r\n1774-75 I lost much money at \xe2\x80\x98White\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Cocoa-Tree,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwas compelled to meet my losses by borrowing largely upon my wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nannuities, insuring her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s life, and so forth. The terms at\r\nwhich I raised these necessary sums and the outlays requisite for my\r\nimprovements were, of course, very onerous, and clipped the property\r\nconsiderably; and it was some of these papers which my Lady Lyndon (who\r\nwas of a narrow, timid, and stingy turn) occasionally refused to sign:\r\nuntil I PERSUADED her, as I have before shown.\r\n\r\nMy dealings on the turf ought to be mentioned, as forming part of my\r\nhistory at this time; but, in truth, I have no particular pleasure\r\nin recalling my Newmarket doings. I was infernally bit and bubbled in\r\nalmost every one of my transactions there; and though I could ride\r\na horse as well as any man in England, was no match with the English\r\nnoblemen at backing him. Fifteen years after my horse, Bay Bulow, by\r\nSophy Hardcastle, out of Eclipse, lost the Newmarket stakes, for which\r\nhe was the first favourite, I found that a noble earl, who shall be\r\nnameless, had got into his stable the morning before he ran; and the\r\nconsequence was that an outside horse won, and your humble servant was\r\nout to the amount of fifteen thousand pounds. Strangers had no chance\r\nin those days on the heath: and, though dazzled by the splendour and\r\nfashion assembled there, and surrounded by the greatest persons of the\r\nland,--the royal dukes, with their wives and splendid equipages; old\r\nGrafton, with his queer bevy of company, and such men as Ancaster,\r\nSandwich, Lorn,--a man might have considered himself certain of fair\r\nplay and have been not a little proud of the society he kept; yet, I\r\npromise you, that, exalted as it was, there was no set of men in Europe\r\nwho knew how to rob more genteelly, to bubble a stranger, to bribe\r\na jockey, to doctor a horse, or to arrange a betting-book. Even _I_\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand against these accomplished gamesters of the highest\r\nfamilies in Europe. Was it my own want of style, or my want of fortune?\r\nI know not. But now I was arrived at the height of my ambition, both\r\nmy skill and my luck seemed to be deserting me. Everything I touched\r\ncrumbled in my hand; every speculation I had failed, every agent I\r\ntrusted deceived me. I am, indeed, one of those born to make, and not to\r\nkeep fortunes; for the qualities and energy which lead a man to effect\r\nthe first are often the very causes of his ruin in the latter case:\r\nindeed, I know of no other reason for the misfortunes which finally\r\nbefell me. [Footnote: The Memoirs seem to have been written about the\r\nyear 1814, in that calm retreat which Fortune had selected for the\r\nauthor at the close of his life.]\r\n\r\nI had always a taste for men of letters, and perhaps, if the truth must\r\nbe told, have no objection to playing the fine gentleman and patron\r\namong the wits. Such people are usually needy, and of low birth, and\r\nhave an instinctive awe and love of a gentleman and a laced coat; as all\r\nmust have remarked who have frequented their society. Mr. Reynolds, who\r\nwas afterwards knighted, and certainly the most elegant painter of\r\nhis day, was a pretty dexterous courtier of the wit tribe; and it was\r\nthrough this gentleman, who painted a piece of me, Lady Lyndon, and\r\nour little Bryan, which was greatly admired at the Exhibition (I\r\nwas represented as quitting my wife, in the costume of the Tippleton\r\nYeomanry, of which I was major; the child starting back from my helmet\r\nlike what-d\xe2\x80\x99ye-call\xe2\x80\x99im--Hector\xe2\x80\x99s son, as described by Mr. Pope in his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Iliad\xe2\x80\x99); it was through Mr. Reynolds that I was introduced to a score\r\nof these gentlemen, and their great chief, Mr. Johnson. I always thought\r\ntheir great chief a great bear. He drank tea twice or thrice at my\r\nhouse, misbehaving himself most grossly; treating my opinions with no\r\nmore respect than those of a schoolboy, and telling me to mind my\r\nhorses and tailors, and not trouble myself about letters. His Scotch\r\nbear-leader, Mr. Boswell, was a butt of the first quality. I never saw\r\nsuch a figure as the fellow cut in what he called a Corsican habit,\r\nat one of Mrs. Cornely\xe2\x80\x99s balls, at Carlisle House, Soho. But that\r\nthe stories connected with that same establishment are not the most\r\nprofitable tales in the world, I could tell tales of scores of queer\r\ndoings there. All the high and low demireps of the town gathered there,\r\nfrom his Grace of Ancaster down to my countryman, poor Mr. Oliver\r\nGoldsmith the poet, and from the Duchess of Kingston down to the Bird\r\nof Paradise, or Kitty Fisher. Here I have met very queer characters,\r\nwho came to queer ends too: poor Hackman, that afterwards was hanged for\r\nkilling Miss Reay, and (on the sly) his Reverence Doctor Simony, whom\r\nmy friend Sam Foote, of the \xe2\x80\x98Little Theatre,\xe2\x80\x99 bade to live even after\r\nforgery and the rope cut short the unlucky parson\xe2\x80\x99s career.\r\n\r\nIt was a merry place, London, in those days, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwriting now in my gouty old age, and people have grown vastly more moral\r\nand matter-of-fact than they were at the close of the last century, when\r\nthe world was young with me. There was a difference between a gentleman\r\nand a common fellow in those times. We wore silk and embroidery then.\r\nNow every man has the same coachmanlike look in his belcher and caped\r\ncoat, and there is no outward difference between my Lord and his groom.\r\nThen it took a man of fashion a couple of hours to make his toilette,\r\nand he could show some taste and genius in the selecting it. What a\r\nblaze of splendour was a drawing-room, or an opera, of a gala night!\r\nWhat sums of money were lost and won at the delicious faro-table! My\r\ngilt curricle and out-riders, blazing in green and gold, were very\r\ndifferent objects from the equipages you see nowadays in the ring, with\r\nthe stunted grooms behind them. A man could drink four times as much as\r\nthe milksops nowadays can swallow; but \xe2\x80\x98tis useless expatiating on this\r\ntheme. Gentlemen are dead and gone. The fashion has now turned upon your\r\nsoldiers and sailors, and I grow quite moody and sad when I think of\r\nthirty years ago.\r\n\r\nThis is a chapter devoted to reminiscences of what was a very happy\r\nand splendid time with me, but presenting little of mark in the way of\r\nadventure; as is generally the case when times are happy and easy. It\r\nwould seem idle to fill pages with accounts of the every-day occupations\r\nof a man of fashion,--the fair ladies who smiled upon him, the dresses\r\nhe wore, the matches he played, and won or lost. At this period of time,\r\nwhen youngsters are employed cutting the Frenchmen\xe2\x80\x99s throats in Spain\r\nand France, lying out in bivouacs, and feeding off commissariat beef and\r\nbiscuit, they would not understand what a life their ancestors led; and\r\nso I shall leave further discourse upon the pleasures of the times when\r\neven the Prince was a lad in leading-strings, when Charles Fox had not\r\nsubsided into a mere statesman, and Buonaparte was a beggarly brat in\r\nhis native island.\r\n\r\nWhilst these improvements were going on in my estates,--my house, from\r\nan antique Norman castle, being changed to an elegant Greek temple,\r\nor palace--my gardens and woods losing their rustic appearance to be\r\nadapted to the most genteel French style--my child growing up at his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s knees, and my influence in the country increasing,--it must\r\nnot be imagined that I stayed in Devonshire all this while, and that I\r\nneglected to make visits to London, and my various estates in England\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\nI went to reside at the Trecothick estate and the Polwellan Wheal, where\r\nI found, instead of profit, every kind of pettifogging chicanery; I\r\npassed over in state to our territories in Ireland, where I entertained\r\nthe gentry in a style the Lord Lieutenant himself could not equal; gave\r\nthe fashion to Dublin (to be sure it was a beggarly savage city in those\r\ndays; and, since the time there has been a pother about the Union, and\r\nthe misfortunes attending it, I have been at a loss to account for the\r\nmad praises of the old order of things, which the fond Irish patriots\r\nhave invented); I say I set the fashion to Dublin; and small praise to\r\nme, for a poor place it was in those times, whatever the Irish party may\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter I have given you a description of it. It was\r\nthe Warsaw of our part of the world: there was a splendid, ruined,\r\nhalf-civilised nobility, ruling over a half-savage population. I say\r\nhalf-savage advisedly. The commonalty in the streets were wild, unshorn,\r\nand in rags. The most public places were not safe after nightfall.\r\nThe College, the public buildings, and the great gentry\xe2\x80\x99s houses were\r\nsplendid (the latter unfinished for the most part); but the people were\r\nin a state more wretched than any vulgar I have ever known: the exercise\r\nof their religion was only half allowed to them; their clergy were\r\nforced to be educated out of the country; their aristocracy was quite\r\ndistinct from them; there was a Protestant nobility, and in the towns,\r\npoor insolent Protestant corporations, with a bankrupt retinue of\r\nmayors, aldermen, and municipal officers--all of whom figured in\r\naddresses and had the public voice in the country; but there was no\r\nsympathy and connection between the upper and the lower people of\r\nthe Irish. To one who had been bred so much abroad as myself, this\r\ndifference between Catholic and Protestant was doubly striking;\r\nand though as firm as a rock in my own faith, yet I could not help\r\nremembering my grandfather held a different one, and wondering that\r\nthere should be such a political difference between the two. I passed\r\namong my neighbours for a dangerous leveller, for entertaining and\r\nexpressing such opinions, and especially for asking the priest of the\r\nparish to my table at Castle Lyndon. He was a gentleman, educated\r\nat Salamanca, and, to my mind, a far better bred and more agreeable\r\ncompanion than his comrade the rector, who had but a dozen Protestants\r\nfor his congregation; who was a lord\xe2\x80\x99s son, to be sure, but he could\r\nhardly spell, and the great field of his labours was in the kennel and\r\ncockpit.\r\n\r\nI did not extend and beautify the house of Castle Lyndon as I had done\r\nour other estates, but contented myself with paying an occasional visit\r\nthere; exercising an almost royal hospitality, and keeping open house\r\nduring my stay. When absent, I gave to my aunt, the widow Brady, and her\r\nsix unmarried daughters (although they always detested me), permission\r\nto inhabit the place; my mother preferring my new mansion of Barryogue.\r\n\r\nAnd as my Lord Bullingdon was by this time grown excessively tall\r\nand troublesome, I determined to leave him under the care of a proper\r\ngovernor in Ireland, with Mrs. Brady and her six daughters to take care\r\nof him; and he was welcome to fall in love with all the old ladies if he\r\nwere so minded, and thereby imitate his stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s example. When tired\r\nof Castle Lyndon, his Lordship was at liberty to go and reside at my\r\nhouse with my mamma; but there was no love lost between him and her,\r\nand, on account of my son Bryan, I think she hated him as cordially as\r\never I myself could possibly do.\r\n\r\nThe county of Devon is not so lucky as the neighbouring county of\r\nCornwall, and has not the share of representatives which the latter\r\npossesses; where I have known a moderate country gentleman, with a\r\nfew score of hundreds per annum from his estate, treble his income by\r\nreturning three or four Members to Parliament, and by the influence with\r\nMinisters which these seats gave him. The parliamentary interest of the\r\nhouse of Lyndon had been grossly neglected during my wife\xe2\x80\x99s minority,\r\nand the incapacity of the Earl her father; or, to speak more correctly,\r\nit had been smuggled away from the Lyndon family altogether by the\r\nadroit old hypocrite of Tiptoff Castle, who acted as most kinsmen and\r\nguardians do by their wards and relatives, and robbed them. The Marquess\r\nof Tiptoff returned four Members to Parliament: two for the borough of\r\nTippleton, which, as all the world knows, lies at the foot of our estate\r\nof Hackton, bounded on the other side by Tiptoff Park. For time out\r\nof mind we had sent Members for that borough, until Tiptoff, taking\r\nadvantage of the late lord\xe2\x80\x99s imbecility, put in his own nominees. When\r\nhis eldest son became of age, of course my Lord was to take his seat for\r\nTippleton; when Rigby (Nabob Rigby, who made his fortune under Clive in\r\nIndia) died, the Marquess thought fit to bring down his second son, my\r\nLord George Poynings, to whom I have introduced the reader in a former\r\nchapter, and determined, in his high mightiness, that he too should go\r\nin and swell the ranks of the Opposition--the big old Whigs, with whom\r\nthe Marquess acted.\r\n\r\nRigby had been for some time in an ailing condition previous to his\r\ndemise, and you may be sure that the circumstance of his failing health\r\nhad not been passed over by the gentry of the county, who were staunch\r\nGovernment men for the most part, and hated my Lord Tiptoff\xe2\x80\x99s principles\r\nas dangerous and ruinous, \xe2\x80\x98We have been looking out for a man to fight\r\nagainst him,\xe2\x80\x99 said the squires to me; \xe2\x80\x98we can only match Tiptoff out\r\nof Hackton Castle. You, Mr. Lyndon, are our man, and at the next county\r\nelection we will swear to bring you in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI hated the Tiptoffs so, that I would have fought them at any election.\r\nThey not only would not visit at Hackton, but declined to receive those\r\nwho visited us; they kept the women of the county from receiving\r\nmy wife: they invented half the wild stories of my profligacy and\r\nextravagance with which the neighbourhood was entertained; they said\r\nI had frightened my wife into marriage, and that she was a lost woman;\r\nthey hinted that Bullingdon\xe2\x80\x99s life was not secure under my roof, that\r\nhis treatment was odious, and that I wanted to put him out of the way\r\nto make place for Bryan my son. I could scarce have a friend to Hackton,\r\nbut they counted the bottles drunk at my table. They ferreted out my\r\ndealings with my lawyers and agents. If a creditor was unpaid, every\r\nitem of his bill was known at Tiptoff Hall; if I looked at a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, it was said I had ruined her. My faults are many, I confess,\r\nand as a domestic character, I can\xe2\x80\x99t boast of any particular regularity\r\nor temper; but Lady Lyndon and I did not quarrel more than fashionable\r\npeople do, and, at first, we always used to make it up pretty well. I\r\nam a man full of errors, certainly, but not the devil that these odious\r\nbackbiters at Tiptoff represented me to be. For the first three years\r\nI never struck my wife but when I was in liquor. When I flung the\r\ncarving-knife at Bullingdon I was drunk, as everybody present can\r\ntestify; but as for having any systematic scheme against the poor lad,\r\nI can declare solemnly that, beyond merely hating him (and one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninclinations are not in one\xe2\x80\x99s power), I am guilty of no evil towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI had sufficient motives, then, for enmity against the Tiptoffs, and am\r\nnot a man to let a feeling of that kind lie inactive. Though a Whig,\r\nor, perhaps, because a Whig, the Marquess was one of the haughtiest\r\nmen breathing, and treated commoners as his idol the great Earl used to\r\ntreat them--after he came to a coronet himself--as so many low vassals,\r\nwho might be proud to lick his shoe-buckle. When the Tippleton mayor and\r\ncorporation waited upon him, he received them covered, never offered Mr.\r\nMayor a chair, but retired when the refreshments were brought, or had\r\nthem served to the worshipful aldermen in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s room. These\r\nhonest Britons never rebelled against such treatment, until instructed\r\nto do so by my patriotism. No, the dogs liked to be bullied; and, in the\r\ncourse of a long experience, I have met with but very few Englishmen who\r\nare not of their way of thinking.\r\n\r\nIt was not until I opened their eyes that they knew their degradation.\r\nI invited the Mayor to Hackton, and Mrs. Mayoress (a very buxom pretty\r\ngroceress she was, by the way) I made sit by my wife, and drove them\r\nboth out to the races in my curricle. Lady Lyndon fought very hard\r\nagainst this condescension; but I had a way with her, as the saying is,\r\nand though she had a temper, yet I had a better one. A temper, psha! A\r\nwild-cat has a temper, but a keeper can get the better of it; and I know\r\nvery few women in the world whom I could not master.\r\n\r\nWell, I made much of the mayor and corporation; sent them bucks for\r\ntheir dinners, or asked them to mine; made a point of attending their\r\nassemblies, dancing with their wives and daughters, going through, in\r\nshort, all the acts of politeness which are necessary on such occasions:\r\nand though old Tiptoff must have seen my goings on, yet his head was\r\nso much in the clouds, that he never once condescended to imagine his\r\ndynasty could be overthrown in his own town of Tippleton, and issued\r\nhis mandates as securely as if he had been the Grand Turk, and the\r\nTippletonians no better than so many slaves of his will.\r\n\r\nEvery post which brought us any account of Rigby\xe2\x80\x99s increasing illness,\r\nwas the sure occasion of a dinner from me; so much so, that my friends\r\nof the hunt used to laugh and say, \xe2\x80\x98Rigby\xe2\x80\x99s worse; there\xe2\x80\x99s a corporation\r\ndinner at Hackton.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was in 1776, when the American war broke out, that I came into\r\nParliament. My Lord Chatham, whose wisdom his party in those days used\r\nto call superhuman, raised his oracular voice in the House of Peers\r\nagainst the American contest; and my countryman, Mr. Burke--a great\r\nphilosopher, but a plaguy long-winded orator--was the champion of the\r\nrebels in the Commons--where, however, thanks to British patriotism, he\r\ncould get very few to back him. Old Tiptoff would have sworn black was\r\nwhite if the great Earl had bidden him; and he made his son give up his\r\ncommission in the Guards, in imitation of my Lord Pitt, who resigned his\r\nensigncy rather than fight against what he called his American brethren.\r\n\r\nBut this was a height of patriotism extremely little relished in\r\nEngland, where, ever since the breaking out of hostilities, our people\r\nhated the Americans heartily; and where, when we heard of the fight of\r\nLexington, and the glorious victory of Bunker\xe2\x80\x99s Hill (as we used to call\r\nit in those days), the nation flushed out in its usual hot-headed anger.\r\nThe talk was all against the philosophers after that, and the people\r\nwere most indomitably loyal. It was not until the land-tax was\r\nincreased, that the gentry began to grumble a little; but still my party\r\nin the West was very strong against the Tiptoffs, and I determined to\r\ntake the field and win as usual.\r\n\r\nThe old Marquess neglected every one of the decent precautions which are\r\nrequisite in a parliamentary campaign. He signified to the corporation\r\nand freeholders his intention of presenting his son, Lord George, and\r\nhis desire that the latter should be elected their burgess; but he\r\nscarcely gave so much as a glass of beer to whet the devotedness of his\r\nadherents: and I, as I need not say, engaged every tavern in Tippleton\r\nin my behalf.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to go over the twenty-times-told tale of an election. I\r\nrescued the borough of Tippleton from the hands of Lord Tiptoff and his\r\nson, Lord George. I had a savage sort of satisfaction, too, in forcing\r\nmy wife (who had been at one time exceedingly smitten by her kinsman,\r\nas I have already related) to take part against him, and to wear and\r\ndistribute my colours when the day of election came. And when we spoke\r\nat one another, I told the crowd that I had beaten Lord George in\r\nlove, that I had beaten him in war, and that I would now beat him in\r\nParliament; and so I did, as the event proved: for, to the inexpressible\r\nanger of the old Marquess, Barry Lyndon, Esquire, was returned member of\r\nParliament for Tippleton, in place of John Rigby, Esquire, deceased; and\r\nI threatened him at the next election to turn him out of BOTH his seats,\r\nand went to attend my duties in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt was then I seriously determined on achieving for myself the Irish\r\npeerage, to be enjoyed after me by my beloved son and heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. MY GOOD FORTUNE BEGINS TO WAVER\r\n\r\nAnd now, if any people should be disposed to think my history immoral\r\n(for I have heard some assert that I was a man who never deserved that\r\nso much prosperity should fall to my share), I will beg those cavillers\r\nto do me the favour to read the conclusion of my adventures; when they\r\nwill see it was no such great prize that I had won, and that wealth,\r\nsplendour, thirty thousand per annum, and a seat in Parliament, are\r\noften purchased at too dear a rate, when one has to buy those enjoyments\r\nat the price of personal liberty, and saddled with the charge of a\r\ntroublesome wife.\r\n\r\nThey are the deuce, these troublesome wives, and that is the truth. No\r\nman knows until he tries how wearisome and disheartening the burthen of\r\none of them is, and how the annoyance grows and strengthens from year\r\nto year, and the courage becomes weaker to bear it; so that that trouble\r\nwhich seemed light and trivial the first year, becomes intolerable\r\nten years after. I have heard of one of the classical fellows in the\r\ndictionary who began by carrying a calf up a hill every day, and so\r\ncontinued until the animal grew to be a bull, which he still easily\r\naccommodated upon his shoulders; but take my word for it, young\r\nunmarried gentlemen, a wife is a very much harder pack to the back than\r\nthe biggest heifer in Smithfield and, if I can prevent one of you from\r\nmarrying, the \xe2\x80\x98Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.\xe2\x80\x99 will not be written in\r\nvain. Not that my Lady was a scold or a shrew, as some wives are; I\r\ncould have managed to have cured her of that; but she was of a cowardly,\r\ncrying, melancholy, maudlin temper, which is to me still more odious:\r\ndo what one would to please her, she would never be happy or in\r\ngood-humour. I left her alone after a while; and because, as was natural\r\nin my case, where a disagreeable home obliged me to seek amusement and\r\ncompanions abroad, she added a mean detestable jealousy to all her other\r\nfaults: I could not for some time pay the commonest attention to any\r\nother woman, but my Lady Lyndon must weep, and wring her hands, and\r\nthreaten to commit suicide, and I know not what.\r\n\r\nHer death would have been no comfort to me, as I leave any person of\r\ncommon prudence to imagine; for that scoundrel of a young Bullingdon\r\n(who was now growing up a tall, gawky, swarthy lad, and about to become\r\nmy greatest plague and annoyance) would have inherited every penny of\r\nthe property, and I should have been left considerably poorer even than\r\nwhen I married the widow: for I spent my personal fortune as well as the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s income in the keeping up of our rank, and was always too much a\r\nman of honour and spirit to save a penny of Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s income. Let\r\nthis be flung in the teeth of my detractors, who say I never could have\r\nso injured the Lyndon property had I not been making a private purse for\r\nmyself; and who believe that, even in my present painful situation, I\r\nhave hoards of gold laid by somewhere, and could come out as a Croesus\r\nwhen I choose. I never raised a shilling upon Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s property but\r\nI spent it like a man of honour; besides incurring numberless personal\r\nobligations for money, which all went to the common stock. Independent\r\nof the Lyndon mortgages and incumbrances, I owe myself at least one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand pounds, which I spent while in occupancy of\r\nmy wife\xe2\x80\x99s estate; so that I may justly say that property is indebted to\r\nme in the above-mentioned sum.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have described the utter disgust and distaste which speedily\r\ntook possession of my breast as regarded Lady Lyndon; and although I\r\ntook no particular pains (for I am all frankness and above-board) to\r\ndisguise my feelings in general, yet she was of such a mean spirit, that\r\nshe pursued me with her regard in spite of my indifference to her, and\r\nwould kindle up at the smallest kind word I spoke to her. The fact is,\r\nbetween my respected reader and myself, that I was one of the handsomest\r\nand most dashing young men of England in those days, and my wife was\r\nviolently in love with me; and though I say it who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, as the\r\nphrase goes, my wife was not the only woman of rank in London who had a\r\nfavourable opinion of the humble Irish adventurer. What a riddle these\r\nwomen are, I have often thought! I have seen the most elegant creatures\r\nat St. James\xe2\x80\x99s grow wild for love of the coarsest and most vulgar of\r\nmen; the cleverest women passionately admire the most illiterate of\r\nour sex, and so on. There is no end to the contrariety in the foolish\r\ncreatures; and though I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hint that _I_ am vulgar or\r\nilliterate, as the persons mentioned above (I would cut the throat of\r\nany man who dared to whisper a word against my birth or my breeding),\r\nyet I have shown that Lady Lyndon had plenty of reason to dislike me\r\nif she chose: but, like the rest of her silly sex, she was governed\r\nby infatuation, not reason; and, up to the very last day of our being\r\ntogether, would be reconciled to me, and fondle me, if I addressed her a\r\nsingle kind word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 she would say, in these moments of tenderness--\xe2\x80\x98Ah, REDMOND, if\r\nyou would always be so!\xe2\x80\x99 And in these fits of love she was the most easy\r\ncreature in the world to be persuaded, and would have signed away her\r\nwhole property, had it been possible. And, I must confess, it was\r\nwith very little attention on my part that I could bring her into\r\ngood-humour. To walk with her on the Mall, or at Ranelagh, to attend her\r\nto church at St. James\xe2\x80\x99s, to purchase any little present or trinket for\r\nher, was enough to coax her. Such is female inconsistency! The next\r\nday she would be calling me \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Barry\xe2\x80\x99 probably, and be bemoaning her\r\nmiserable fate that she ever should have been united to such a monster.\r\nSo it was she was pleased to call one of the most brilliant men in His\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s three kingdoms: and I warrant me OTHER ladies had a much more\r\nflattering opinion of me.\r\n\r\nThen she would threaten to leave me; but I had a hold of her in the\r\nperson of her son, of whom she was passionately fond: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhy, for she had always neglected Bullingdon her older son, and never\r\nbestowed a thought upon his health, his welfare, or his education.\r\n\r\nIt was our young boy, then, who formed the great bond of union between\r\nme and her Ladyship; and there was no plan of ambition I could propose\r\nin which she would not join for the poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s behoof, and no expense\r\nshe would not eagerly incur, if it might by any means be shown to tend\r\nto his advancement. I can tell you, bribes were administered, and in\r\nhigh places too,--so near the royal person of His Majesty, that you\r\nwould be astonished were I to mention what great personages condescended\r\nto receive our loans. I got from the English and Irish heralds a\r\ndescription and detailed pedigree of the Barony of Barryogue, and\r\nclaimed respectfully to be reinstated in my ancestral titles, and also\r\nto be rewarded with the Viscounty of Ballybarry. \xe2\x80\x98This head would become\r\na coronet,\xe2\x80\x99 my Lady would sometimes say, in her fond moments, smoothing\r\ndown my hair; and, indeed, there is many a puny whipster in their\r\nLordships\xe2\x80\x99 house who has neither my presence nor my courage, my\r\npedigree, nor any of my merits.\r\n\r\nThe striving after this peerage I considered to have been one of\r\nthe most unlucky of all my unlucky dealings at this period. I made\r\nunheard-of sacrifices to bring it about. I lavished money here and\r\ndiamonds there. I bought lands at ten times their value; purchased\r\npictures and articles of vertu at ruinous prices. I gave repeated\r\nentertainments to those friends to my claims who, being about the Royal\r\nperson, were likely to advance it. I lost many a bet to the Royal Dukes\r\nHis Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s brothers; but let these matters be forgotten, and,\r\nbecause of my private injuries, let me not be deficient in loyalty to my\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\nThe only person in this transaction whom I shall mention openly, is that\r\nold scamp and swindler, Gustavus Adolphus, thirteenth Earl of Crabs.\r\nThis nobleman was one of the gentlemen of His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s closet, and one\r\nwith whom the revered monarch was on terms of considerable intimacy. A\r\nclose regard had sprung up between them in the old King\xe2\x80\x99s time; when\r\nHis Royal Highness, playing at battledore and shuttlecock with the young\r\nlord on the landing-place of the great staircase at Kew, in some moment\r\nof irritation the Prince of Wales kicked the young Earl downstairs, who,\r\nfalling, broke his leg. The Prince\xe2\x80\x99s hearty repentance for his violence\r\ncaused him to ally himself closely with the person whom he had injured;\r\nand when His Majesty came to the throne there was no man, it is said, of\r\nwhom the Earl of Bute was so jealous as of my Lord Crabs. The latter was\r\npoor and extravagant, and Bute got him out of the way, by sending him\r\non the Russian and other embassies; but on this favourite\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal,\r\nCrabs sped back from the Continent, and was appointed almost immediately\r\nto a place about His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s person.\r\n\r\nIt was with this disreputable nobleman that I contracted an unluckly\r\nintimacy; when, fresh and unsuspecting, I first established myself in\r\ntown, after my marriage with Lady Lyndon: and, as Crabs was really one\r\nof the most entertaining fellows in the world, I took a sincere pleasure\r\nin his company; besides the interesting desire I had in cultivating the\r\nsociety of a man who was so near the person of the highest personage in\r\nthe realm.\r\n\r\nTo hear the fellow, you would fancy that there was scarce any\r\nappointment made in which he had not a share. He told me, for instance,\r\nof Charles Fox being turned out of his place a day before poor Charley\r\nhimself was aware of the fact. He told me when the Howes were coming\r\nback from America, and who was to succeed to the command there. Not\r\nto multiply instances, it was upon this person that I fixed my chief\r\nreliance for the advancement of my claim to the Barony of Barryogue and\r\nthe Viscounty which I proposed to get.\r\n\r\nOne of the main causes of expense which this ambition of mine entailed\r\nupon me was the fitting out and arming a company of infantry from the\r\nCastle Lyndon and Hackton estates in Ireland, which I offered to my\r\ngracious Sovereign for the campaign against the American rebels. These\r\ntroops, superbly equipped and clothed, were embarked at Portsmouth in\r\nthe year 1778; and the patriotism of the gentleman who had raised them\r\nwas so acceptable at Court, that, on being presented by my Lord North,\r\nHis Majesty condescended to notice me particularly, and said, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright, Mr. Lyndon, raise another company; and go with them, too!\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nthis was by no means, as the reader may suppose, to my notions. A man\r\nwith thirty thousand pounds per annum is a fool to risk his life like a\r\ncommon beggar: and on this account I have always admired the conduct of\r\nmy friend Jack Bolter, who had been a most active and resolute cornet\r\nof horse, and, as such, engaged in every scrape and skirmish which could\r\nfall to his lot; but just before the battle of Minden he received news\r\nthat his uncle, the great army contractor, was dead, and had left him\r\nfive thousand per annum. Jack that instant applied for leave; and, as\r\nit was refused him on the eve of a general action, my gentleman took it,\r\nand never fired a pistol again: except against an officer who questioned\r\nhis courage, and whom he winged in such a cool and determined manner, as\r\nshowed all the world that it was from prudence and a desire of enjoying\r\nhis money, not from cowardice, that he quitted the profession of arms.\r\n\r\nWhen this Hackton company was raised, my stepson, who was now sixteen\r\nyears of age, was most eager to be allowed to join it, and I would have\r\ngladly consented to have been rid of the young man; but his guardian,\r\nLord Tiptoff, who thwarted me in everything, refused his permission, and\r\nthe lad\xe2\x80\x99s military inclinations were balked. If he could have gone on\r\nthe expedition, and a rebel rifle had put an end to him, I believe, to\r\ntell the truth, I should not have been grieved over-much; and I should\r\nhave had the pleasure of seeing my other son the heir to the estate\r\nwhich his father had won with so much pains.\r\n\r\nThe education of this young nobleman had been, I confess, some of the\r\nloosest; and perhaps the truth is, I DID neglect the brat. He was of\r\nso wild, savage, and insubordinate a nature, that I never had the least\r\nregard for him; and before me and his mother, at least, was so moody and\r\ndull, that I thought instruction thrown away upon him, and left him for\r\nthe most part to shift for himself. For two whole years he remained\r\nin Ireland away from us; and when in England, we kept him mainly at\r\nHackton, never caring to have the uncouth ungainly lad in the genteel\r\ncompany in the capital in which we naturally mingled. My own poor boy,\r\non the contrary, was the most polite and engaging child ever seen: it\r\nwas a pleasure to treat him with kindness and distinction; and before he\r\nwas five years old, the little fellow was the pink of fashion, beauty,\r\nand good breeding.\r\n\r\nIn fact he could not have been otherwise, with the care both his parents\r\nbestowed upon him, and the attentions that were lavished upon him in\r\nevery way. When he was four years old, I quarrelled with the English\r\nnurse who had attended upon him, and about whom my wife had been so\r\njealous, and procured for him a French gouvernante, who had lived with\r\nfamilies of the first quality in Paris; and who, of course, must set my\r\nLady Lyndon jealous too. Under the care of this young woman my little\r\nrogue learned to chatter French most charmingly. It would have done your\r\nheart good to hear the dear rascal swear Mort de ma vie! and to see\r\nhim stamp his little foot, and send the manants and canaille of the\r\ndomestics to the trente mille diables. He was precocious in all things:\r\nat a very early age he would mimic everybody; at five, he would sit at\r\ntable, and drink his glass of champagne with the best of us; and his\r\nnurse would teach him little French catches, and the last Parisian songs\r\nof Vade and Collard,--pretty songs they were too; and would make such\r\nof his hearers as understood French burst with laughing, and, I promise\r\nyou, scandalise some of the old dowagers who were admitted into the\r\nsociety of his mamma: not that there were many of them; for I did not\r\nencourage the visits of what you call respectable people to Lady Lyndon.\r\nThey are sad spoilers of sport,--tale-bearers, envious narrow-minded\r\npeople; making mischief between man and wife. Whenever any of these\r\ngrave personages in hoops and high heels used to make their appearance\r\nat Hackton, or in Berkeley Square, it was my chief pleasure to frighten\r\nthem off; and I would make my little Bryan dance, sing, and play the\r\ndiable a quatre, and aid him myself, so as to scare the old frumps.\r\n\r\nI never shall forget the solemn remonstrances of our old square-toes of\r\na rector at Hackton, who made one or two vain attempts to teach little\r\nBryan Latin, and with whose innumerable children I sometimes allowed the\r\nboy to associate. They learned some of Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s French songs from him,\r\nwhich their mother, a poor soul who understood pickles and custards much\r\nbetter than French, used fondly to encourage them in singing; but which\r\ntheir father one day hearing, he sent Miss Sarah to her bedroom and\r\nbread and water for a week, and solemnly horsed Master Jacob in the\r\npresence of all his brothers and sisters, and of Bryan, to whom he hoped\r\nthat flogging would act as a warning. But my little rogue kicked and\r\nplunged at the old parson\xe2\x80\x99s shins until he was obliged to get his sexton\r\nto hold him down, and swore, corbleu, morbleu, ventrebleu, that his\r\nyoung friend Jacob should not be maltreated. After this scene, his\r\nreverence forbade Bryan the rectory-house; on which I swore that his\r\neldest son, who was bringing up for the ministry, should never have the\r\nsuccession of the living of Hackton, which I had thoughts of bestowing\r\non him; and his father said, with a canting hypocritical air, which\r\nI hate, that Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will must be done; that he would not have his\r\nchildren disobedient or corrupted for the sake of a bishopric, and wrote\r\nme a pompous and solemn letter, charged with Latin quotations, taking\r\nfarewell of me and my house. \xe2\x80\x98I do so with regret,\xe2\x80\x99 added the old\r\ngentleman, \xe2\x80\x98for I have received so many kindnesses from the Hackton\r\nfamily that it goes to my heart to be disunited from them. My poor, I\r\nfear, may suffer in consequence of my separation from you, and my being\r\nhence-forward unable to bring to your notice instances of distress\r\nand affliction; which, when they were known to you, I will do you the\r\njustice to say, your generosity was always prompt to relieve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere may have been some truth in this, for the old gentleman was\r\nperpetually pestering me with petitions, and I know for a certainty,\r\nfrom his own charities, was often without a shilling in his pocket;\r\nbut I suspect the good dinners at Hackton had a considerable share in\r\ncausing his regrets at the dissolution of our intimacy: and I know\r\nthat his wife was quite sorry to forego the acquaintance of Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngouvernante, Mademoiselle Louison, who had all the newest French\r\nfashions at her fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends, and who never went to the rectory but you\r\nwould see the girls of the family turn out in new sacks or mantles the\r\nSunday after.\r\n\r\nI used to punish the old rebel by snoring very loud in my pew on Sundays\r\nduring sermon-time; and I got a governor presently for Bryan, and a\r\nchaplain of my own, when he became of age sufficient to be separated\r\nfrom the women\xe2\x80\x99s society and guardianship. His English nurse I married\r\nto my head gardener, with a handsome portion; his French gouvernante I\r\nbestowed upon my faithful German Fritz, not forgetting the dowry in the\r\nlatter instance; and they set up a French dining-house in Soho, and I\r\nbelieve at the time I write they are richer in the world\xe2\x80\x99s goods than\r\ntheir generous and free-handed master.\r\n\r\nFor Bryan I now got a young gentleman from Oxford, the Rev. Edmund\r\nLavender, who was commissioned to teach him Latin, when the boy was\r\nin the humour, and to ground him in history, grammar, and the other\r\nqualifications of a gentleman. Lavender was a precious addition to our\r\nsociety at Hackton. He was the means of making a deal of fun there. He\r\nwas the butt of all our jokes, and bore them with the most admirable and\r\nmartyrlike patience. He was one of that sort of men who would rather be\r\nkicked by a great man than not be noticed by him; and I have often put\r\nhis wig into the fire in the face of the company, when he would laugh\r\nat the joke as well as any man there. It was a delight to put him on\r\na high-mettled horse, and send him after the hounds,--pale, sweating,\r\ncalling on us, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, to stop, and holding on for dear life\r\nby the mane and the crupper. How it happened that the fellow was never\r\nkilled I know not; but I suppose hanging is the way in which HIS neck\r\nwill be broke. He never met with any accident, to speak of, in our\r\nhunting-matches: but you were pretty sure to find him at dinner in his\r\nplace at the bottom of the table making the punch, whence he would be\r\ncarried off fuddled to bed before the night was over. Many a time have\r\nBryan and I painted his face black on those occasions. We put him into\r\na haunted room, and frightened his soul out of his body with ghosts; we\r\nlet loose cargoes of rats upon his bed; we cried fire, and filled his\r\nboots with water; we cut the legs of his preaching-chair, and filled his\r\nsermon-book with snuff. Poor Lavender bore it all with patience; and\r\nat our parties, or when we came to London, was amply repaid by being\r\nallowed to sit with the gentlefolks, and to fancy himself in the society\r\nof men of fashion. It was good to hear the contempt with which he talked\r\nabout our rector. \xe2\x80\x98He has a son, sir, who is a servitor: and a servitor\r\nat a small college,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say. \xe2\x80\x98How COULD you, my dear sir, think of\r\ngiving the reversion of Hackton to such a low-bred creature?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI should now speak of my other son, at least my Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s: I mean\r\nthe Viscount Bullingdon. I kept him in Ireland for some years, under the\r\nguardianship of my mother, whom I had installed at Castle Lyndon; and\r\ngreat, I promise you, was her state in that occupation, and prodigious\r\nthe good soul\xe2\x80\x99s splendour and haughty bearing. With all her oddities,\r\nthe Castle Lyndon estate was the best managed of all our possessions;\r\nthe rents were excellently paid, the charges of getting them in smaller\r\nthan they would have been under the management of any steward. It was\r\nastonishing what small expenses the good widow incurred; although she\r\nkept up the dignity of the TWO families, as she would say. She had a set\r\nof domestics to attend upon the young lord; she never went out herself\r\nbut in an old gilt coach and six; the house was kept clean and tight;\r\nthe furniture and gardens in the best repair; and, in our occasional\r\nvisits to Ireland, we never found any house we visited in such good\r\ncondition as our own. There were a score of ready serving-lasses,\r\nand half as many trim men about the castle; and everything in as fine\r\ncondition as the best housekeeper could make it. All this she did with\r\nscarcely any charges to us: for she fed sheep and cattle in the parks,\r\nand made a handsome profit of them at Ballinasloe; she supplied I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how many towns with butter and bacon; and the fruit and vegetables\r\nfrom the gardens of Castle Lyndon got the highest prices in Dublin\r\nmarket. She had no waste in the kitchen, as there used to be in most of\r\nour Irish houses; and there was no consumption of liquor in the cellars,\r\nfor the old lady drank water, and saw little or no company. All her\r\nsociety was a couple of the girls of my ancient flame Nora Brady, now\r\nMrs. Quin; who with her husband had spent almost all their property,\r\nand who came to see me once in London, looking very old, fat, and\r\nslatternly, with two dirty children at her side. She wept very much when\r\nshe saw me, called me \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Lyndon,\xe2\x80\x99 at which I was not sorry,\r\nand begged me to help her husband; which I did, getting him, through\r\nmy friend Lord Crabs, a place in the excise in Ireland, and paying the\r\npassage of his family and himself to that country. I found him a dirty,\r\ncast-down, snivelling drunkard; and, looking at poor Nora, could not but\r\nwonder at the days when I had thought her a divinity. But if ever I have\r\nhad a regard for a woman, I remain through life her constant friend,\r\nand could mention a thousand such instances of my generous and faithful\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nYoung Bullingdon, however, was almost the only person with whom she was\r\nconcerned that my mother could not keep in order. The accounts she sent\r\nme of him at first were such as gave my paternal heart considerable\r\npain. He rejected all regularity and authority. He would absent himself\r\nfor weeks from the house on sporting or other expeditions. He was when\r\nat home silent and queer, refusing to make my mother\xe2\x80\x99s game at piquet of\r\nevenings, but plunging into all sorts of musty old books, with which he\r\nmuddled his brains; more at ease laughing and chatting with the\r\npipers and maids in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, than with the gentry in the\r\ndrawing-room; always cutting jibes and jokes at Mrs. Barry, at which\r\nshe (who was rather a slow woman at repartee) would chafe violently: in\r\nfact, leading a life of insubordination and scandal. And, to crown\r\nall, the young scapegrace took to frequenting the society of the Romish\r\npriest of the parish--a threadbare rogue, from some Popish seminary in\r\nFrance or Spain--rather than the company of the vicar of Castle Lyndon,\r\na gentleman of Trinity, who kept his hounds and drank his two bottles a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nRegard for the lad\xe2\x80\x99s religion made me not hesitate then how I should act\r\ntowards him. If I have any principle which has guided me through life,\r\nit has been respect for the Establishment, and a hearty scorn and\r\nabhorrence of all other forms of belief. I therefore sent my French\r\nbody-servant, in the year 17--, to Dublin with a commission to bring\r\nthe young reprobate over; and the report brought to me was that he\r\nhad passed the whole of the last night of his stay in Ireland with his\r\nPopish friend at the mass-house; that he and my mother had a violent\r\nquarrel on the very last day; that, on the contrary, he kissed Biddy and\r\nDosy, her two nieces, who seemed very sorry that he should go; and that\r\nbeing pressed to go and visit the rector, he absolutely refused, saying\r\nhe was a wicked old Pharisee, inside whose doors he would never set his\r\nfoot. The doctor wrote me a letter, warning me against the deplorable\r\nerrors of this young imp of perdition, as he called him; and I could see\r\nthat there was no love lost between them. But it appeared that, if not\r\nagreeable to the gentry of the country, young Bullingdon had a huge\r\npopularity among the common people. There was a regular crowd weeping\r\nround the gate when his coach took its departure. Scores of the ignorant\r\nsavage wretches ran for miles along by the side of the chariot; and some\r\nwent even so far as to steal away before his departure, and appear\r\nat the Pigeon-House at Dublin to bid him a last farewell. It was with\r\nconsiderable difficulty that some of these people could be kept from\r\nsecreting themselves in the vessel, and accompanying their young lord to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nTo do the young scoundrel justice, when he came among us, he was a\r\nmanly noble-looking lad, and everything in his bearing and appearance\r\nbetokened the high blood from which he came. He was the very portrait\r\nof some of the dark cavaliers of the Lyndon race, whose pictures hung\r\nin the gallery at Hackton: where the lad was fond of spending the chief\r\npart of his time, occupied with the musty old books which he took out of\r\nthe library, and which I hate to see a young man of spirit poring over.\r\nAlways in my company he preserved the most rigid silence, and a haughty\r\nscornful demeanour; which was so much the more disagreeable because\r\nthere was nothing in his behaviour I could actually take hold of to find\r\nfault with: although his whole conduct was insolent and supercilious to\r\nthe highest degree. His mother was very much agitated at receiving him\r\non his arrival; if he felt any such agitation he certainly did not show\r\nit. He made her a very low and formal bow when he kissed her hand; and,\r\nwhen I held out mine, put both his hands behind his back, stared me full\r\nin the face, and bent his head, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Barry Lyndon, I believe;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nturned on his heel, and began talking about the state of the weather to\r\nhis mother, whom he always styled \xe2\x80\x98Your Ladyship.\xe2\x80\x99 She was angry at this\r\npert bearing, and, when they were alone, rebuked him sharply for not\r\nshaking hands with his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father, madam?\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98surely you mistake. My father was the\r\nRight Honourable Sir Charles Lyndon. _I_ at least have not forgotten\r\nhim, if others have.\xe2\x80\x99 It was a declaration of war to me, as I saw at\r\nonce; though I declare I was willing enough to have received the boy\r\nwell on his coming amongst us, and to have lived with him on terms of\r\nfriendliness. But as men serve me I serve them. Who can blame me for my\r\nafter-quarrels with this young reprobate, or lay upon my shoulders\r\nthe evils which afterwards befell? Perhaps I lost my temper, and my\r\nsubsequent treatment of him WAS hard. But it was he began the quarrel,\r\nand not I; and the evil consequences which ensued were entirely of his\r\ncreating.\r\n\r\nAs it is best to nip vice in the bud, and for a master of a family to\r\nexercise his authority in such a manner as that there may be no question\r\nabout it, I took the earliest opportunity of coming to close quarters\r\nwith Master Bullingdon; and the day after his arrival among us, upon\r\nhis refusal to perform some duty which I requested of him, I had him\r\nconveyed to my study, and thrashed him soundly. This process, I confess,\r\nat first agitated me a good deal, for I had never laid a whip on a lord\r\nbefore; but I got speedily used to the practice, and his back and my\r\nwhip became so well acquainted, that I warrant there was very little\r\nCEREMONY between us after a while.\r\n\r\nIf I were to repeat all the instances of the insubordination and brutal\r\nconduct of young Bullingdon, I should weary the reader. His perseverance\r\nin resistance was, I think, even greater than mine in correcting him:\r\nfor a man, be he ever so much resolved to do his duty as a parent, can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe flogging his children all day, or for every fault they commit: and\r\nthough I got the character of being so cruel a stepfather to him, I\r\npledge my word I spared him correction when he merited it many more\r\ntimes than I administered it. Besides, there were eight clear months\r\nin the year when he was quit of me, during the time of my presence in\r\nLondon, at my place in Parliament, and at the Court of my Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAt this period I made no difficulty to allow him to profit by the\r\nLatin and Greek of the old rector; who had christened him, and had a\r\nconsiderable influence over the wayward lad. After a scene or a quarrel\r\nbetween us, it was generally to the rectory-house that the young rebel\r\nwould fly for refuge and counsel; and I must own that the parson was a\r\npretty just umpire between us in our disputes. Once he led the boy\r\nback to Hackton by the hand, and actually brought him into my presence,\r\nalthough he had vowed never to enter the doors in my lifetime again, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98He had brought his Lordship to acknowledge his error, and submit\r\nto any punishment I might think proper to inflict.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon which I caned\r\nhim in the presence of two or three friends of mine, with whom I was\r\nsitting drinking at the time; and to do him justice, he bore a pretty\r\nsevere punishment without wincing or crying in the least. This will\r\nshow that I was not too severe in my treatment of the lad, as I had the\r\nauthority of the clergyman himself for inflicting the correction which I\r\nthought proper.\r\n\r\nTwice or thrice, Lavender, Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s governor, attempted to punish my\r\nLord Bullingdon; but I promise you the rogue was too strong for HIM,\r\nand levelled the Oxford man to the ground with a chair: greatly to the\r\ndelight of little Byran, who cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Bravo, Bully! thump him, thump\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x99 And Bully certainly did, to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s heart\xe2\x80\x99s content; who\r\nnever attempted personal chastisement afterwards; but contented himself\r\nby bringing the tales of his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s misdoings to me, his natural\r\nprotector and guardian.\r\n\r\nWith the child, Bullingdon was, strange to say, pretty tractable. He\r\ntook a liking for the little fellow,--as, indeed, everybody who saw that\r\ndarling boy did,--liked him the more, he said, because he was \xe2\x80\x98half\r\na Lyndon.\xe2\x80\x99 And well he might like him, for many a time, at the dear\r\nangel\xe2\x80\x99s intercession of \xe2\x80\x98Papa, don\xe2\x80\x99t flog Bully to-day!\xe2\x80\x99 I have held my\r\nhand, and saved him a horsing, which he richly deserved.\r\n\r\nWith his mother, at first, he would scarcely deign to have any\r\ncommunication. He said she was no longer one of the family. Why should\r\nhe love her, as she had never been a mother to him? But it will give\r\nthe reader an idea of the dogged obstinacy and surliness of the lad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter, when I mention one trait regarding him. It has been made\r\na matter of complaint against me, that I denied him the education\r\nbefitting a gentleman, and never sent him to college or to school; but\r\nthe fact is, it was of his own choice that he went to neither. He\r\nhad the offer repeatedly from me (who wished to see as little of his\r\nimpudence as possible), but he as repeatedly declined; and, for a long\r\ntime, I could not make out what was the charm which kept him in a house\r\nwhere he must have been far from comfortable.\r\n\r\nIt came out, however, at last. There used to be very frequent disputes\r\nbetween my Lady Lyndon and myself, in which sometimes she was wrong,\r\nsometimes I was; and which, as neither of us had very angelical\r\ntempers, used to run very high. I was often in liquor; and when in that\r\ncondition, what gentleman is master of himself? Perhaps I DID, in this\r\nstate, use my Lady rather roughly; fling a glass or two at her, and call\r\nher by a few names that were not complimentary. I may have threatened\r\nher life (which it was obviously my interest not to take), and have\r\nfrightened her, in a word, considerably.\r\n\r\nAfter one of these disputes, in which she ran screaming through the\r\ngalleries, and I, as tipsy as a lord, came staggering after, it appears\r\nBullingdon was attracted out of his room by the noise; as I came up\r\nwith her, the audacious rascal tripped up my heels, which were not very\r\nsteady, and catching his fainting mother in his arms, took her into his\r\nown room; where he, upon her entreaty, swore he would never leave the\r\nhouse as long as she continued united with me. I knew nothing of the\r\nvow, or indeed of the tipsy frolic which was the occasion of it; I was\r\ntaken up \xe2\x80\x98glorious,\xe2\x80\x99 as the phrase is, by my servants, and put to bed,\r\nand, in the morning, had no more recollection of what had occurred any\r\nmore than of what happened when I was a baby at the breast. Lady Lyndon\r\ntold me of the circumstance years after; and I mention it here, as it\r\nenables me to plead honourably \xe2\x80\x98not guilty\xe2\x80\x99 to one of the absurd charges\r\nof cruelty trumped up against me with respect to my stepson. Let my\r\ndetractors apologise, if they dare, for the conduct of a graceless\r\nruffian who trips up the heels of his own natural guardian and\r\nstepfather after dinner.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance served to unite mother and son for a little; but their\r\ncharacters were too different. I believe she was too fond of me ever to\r\nallow him to be sincerely reconciled to her. As he grew up to be a man,\r\nhis hatred towards me assumed an intensity quite wicked to think of (and\r\nwhich I promise you I returned with interest): and it was at the age\r\nof sixteen, I think, that the impudent young hangdog, on my return from\r\nParliament one summer, and on my proposing to cane him as usual, gave me\r\nto understand that he would submit to no farther chastisement from me,\r\nand said, grinding his teeth, that he would shoot me if I laid hands on\r\nhim. I looked at him; he was grown, in fact, to be a tall young man, and\r\nI gave up that necessary part of his education.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that I raised the company which was to serve in\r\nAmerica; and my enemies in the country (and since my victory over the\r\nTiptoffs I scarce need say I had many of them) began to propagate\r\nthe most shameful reports regarding my conduct to that precious young\r\nscapegrace my stepson, and to insinuate that I actually wished to get\r\nrid of him. Thus my loyalty to my Sovereign was actually construed into\r\na horrid unnatural attempt on my part on Bullingdon\xe2\x80\x99s life; and it\r\nwas said that I had raised the American corps for the sole purpose of\r\ngetting the young Viscount to command it, and so of getting rid of him.\r\nI am not sure that they had not fixed upon the name of the very man in\r\nthe company who was ordered to despatch him at the first general action,\r\nand the bribe I was to give him for this delicate piece of service.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, I was of opinion then (and though the fulfilment of\r\nmy prophecy has been delayed, yet I make no doubt it will be brought to\r\npass ere long), that my Lord Bullingdon needed none of MY aid in sending\r\nhim into the other world; but had a happy knack of finding the way\r\nthither himself, which he would be sure to pursue. In truth, he began\r\nupon this way early: of all the violent, daring, disobedient scapegraces\r\nthat ever caused an affectionate parent pain, he was certainly the most\r\nincorrigible; there was no beating him, or coaxing him, or taming him.\r\n\r\nFor instance, with my little son, when his governor brought him into the\r\nroom as we were over the bottle after dinner, my Lord would begin his\r\nviolent and undutiful sarcasms at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say, beginning to caress and fondle him, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\na pity it is I am not dead for thy sake! The Lyndons would then have a\r\nworthier representative, and enjoy all the benefit of the illustrious\r\nblood of the Barrys of Barryogue; would they not, Mr. Barry Lyndon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe always chose the days when company, or the clergy or gentry of the\r\nneighbourhood, were present, to make these insolent speeches to me.\r\n\r\nAnother day (it was Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s birthday) we were giving a grand ball\r\nand gala at Hackton, and it was time for my little Bryan to make his\r\nappearance among us, as he usually did in the smartest little court-suit\r\nyou ever saw (ah me! but it brings tears into my old eyes now to think\r\nof the bright looks of that darling little face). There was a great\r\ncrowding and tittering when the child came in, led by his half-brother,\r\nwho walked into the dancing-room (would you believe it?) in his\r\nstocking-feet, leading little Bryan by the hand, paddling about in the\r\ngreat shoes of the elder! \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he fits my shoes very well,\r\nSir Richard Wargrave?\xe2\x80\x99 says the young reprobate: upon which the company\r\nbegan to look at each other and to titter; and his mother, coming up to\r\nLord Bullingdon with great dignity, seized the child to her breast, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98From the manner in which I love this child, my Lord, you ought\r\nto know how I would have loved his elder brother had he proved worthy of\r\nany mother\xe2\x80\x99s affection!\xe2\x80\x99 and, bursting into tears, Lady Lyndon left the\r\napartment, and the young lord rather discomfited for once.\r\n\r\nAt last, on one occasion, his behaviour to me was so outrageous (it was\r\nin the hunting-field and in a large public company), that I lost all\r\npatience, rode at the urchin straight, wrenched him out of his saddle\r\nwith all my force, and, flinging him roughly to the ground, sprang\r\ndown to it myself, and administered such a correction across the young\r\ncaitiff\xe2\x80\x99s head and shoulders with my horsewhip as might have ended in\r\nhis death, had I not been restrained in time; for my passion was up, and\r\nI was in a state to do murder or any other crime. The lad was taken home\r\nand put to bed, where he lay for a day or two in a fever, as much from\r\nrage and vexation as from the chastisement I had given him; and three\r\ndays afterwards, on sending to inquire at his chamber whether he would\r\njoin the family at table, a note was found on his table, and his bed\r\nwas empty and cold. The young villain had fled, and had the audacity to\r\nwrite in the following terms regarding me to my wife, his mother:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I have borne as long as mortal could endure the\r\nill-treatment of the insolent Irish upstart whom you have taken to your\r\nbed. It is not only the lowness of his birth and the general brutality\r\nof his manners which disgust me, and must make me hate him so long as I\r\nhave the honour to bear the name of Lyndon, which he is unworthy of, but\r\nthe shameful nature of his conduct towards your Ladyship; his brutal\r\nand ungentlemanlike behaviour, his open infidelity, his habits of\r\nextravagance, intoxication, his shameless robberies and swindling of my\r\nproperty and yours. It is these insults to you which shock and annoy me,\r\nmore than the ruffian\xe2\x80\x99s infamous conduct to myself. I would have stood\r\nby your Ladyship as I promised, but you seem to have taken latterly\r\nyour husband\xe2\x80\x99s part; and, as I cannot personally chastise this low-bred\r\nruffian, who, to our shame be it spoken, is the husband of my mother;\r\nand as I cannot bear to witness his treatment of you, and loathe his\r\nhorrible society as if it were the plague, I am determined to quit my\r\nnative country: at least during his detested life, or during my own.\r\nI possess a small income from my father, of which I have no doubt Mr.\r\nBarry will cheat me if he can; but which, if your Ladyship has some\r\nfeelings of a mother left, you will, perhaps, award to me. Messrs.\r\nChilds, the bankers, can have orders to pay it to me when due; if they\r\nreceive no such orders, I shall be not in the least surprised, knowing\r\nyou to be in the hands of a villain who would not scruple to rob on\r\nthe highway; and shall try to find out some way in life for myself more\r\nhonourable than that by which the penniless Irish adventurer has arrived\r\nto turn me out of my rights and home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis mad epistle was signed \xe2\x80\x98Bullingdon,\xe2\x80\x99 and all the neighbours vowed\r\nthat I had been privy to his flight, and would profit by it; though I\r\ndeclare on my honour my true and sincere desire, after reading the above\r\ninfamous letter, was to have the author within a good arm\xe2\x80\x99s length of\r\nme, that I might let him know my opinion regarding him. But there was no\r\neradicating this idea from people\xe2\x80\x99s minds, who insisted that I wanted\r\nto kill Bullingdon; whereas murder, as I have said, was never one of my\r\nevil qualities: and even had I wished to injure my young enemy ever so\r\nmuch, common prudence would have made my mind easy, as I knew he was\r\ngoing to ruin his own way.\r\n\r\nIt was long before we heard of the fate of the audacious young truant;\r\nbut after some fifteen months had elapsed, I had the pleasure of being\r\nable to refute some of the murderous calumnies which had been uttered\r\nagainst me, by producing a bill with Bullingdon\xe2\x80\x99s own signature, drawn\r\nfrom General Tarleton\xe2\x80\x99s army in America, where my company was conducting\r\nitself with the greatest glory, and with which my Lord was serving as\r\na volunteer. There were some of my kind friends who persisted still in\r\nattributing all sorts of wicked intentions to me. Lord Tiptoff would\r\nnever believe that I would pay any bill, much more any bill of Lord\r\nBullingdon\xe2\x80\x99s; old Lady Betty Grimsby, his sister, persisted in declaring\r\nthe bill was a forgery, and the poor dear lord dead; until there came a\r\nletter to her Ladyship from Lord Bullingdon himself, who had been at New\r\nYork at headquarters, and who described at length the splendid festival\r\ngiven by the officers of the garrison to our distinguished chieftains,\r\nthe two Howes.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, if I HAD murdered my Lord, I could scarcely have been\r\nreceived with more shameful obloquy and slander than now followed me in\r\ntown and country. \xe2\x80\x98You will hear of the lad\xe2\x80\x99s death, be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed\r\none of my friends. \xe2\x80\x98And then his wife\xe2\x80\x99s will follow,\xe2\x80\x99 added another. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nwill marry Jenny Jones,\xe2\x80\x99 added a third; and so on. Lavender brought me\r\nthe news of these scandals about me: the country was up against me. The\r\nfarmers on market-days used to touch their hats sulkily, and get out of\r\nmy way; the gentlemen who followed my hunt now suddenly seceded from it,\r\nand left off my uniform; at the county ball, where I led out Lady Susan\r\nCapermore, and took my place third in the dance after the duke and the\r\nmarquis, as was my wont, all the couples turned away as we came to them,\r\nand we were left to dance alone. Sukey Capermore has a love of dancing\r\nwhich would make her dance at a funeral if anybody asked her, and I had\r\ntoo much spirit to give in at this signal instance of insult towards me;\r\nso we danced with some of the very commonest low people at the bottom of\r\nthe set--your apothecaries, wine-merchants, attorneys, and such scum as\r\nare allowed to attend our public assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe bishop, my Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s relative, neglected to invite us to the\r\npalace at the assizes; and, in a word, every indignity was put upon me\r\nwhich could by possibility be heaped upon an innocent and honourable\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nMy reception in London, whither I now carried my wife and family, was\r\nscarcely more cordial. On paying my respects to my Sovereign at\r\nSt. James\xe2\x80\x99s, His Majesty pointedly asked me when I had news of Lord\r\nBullingdon. On which I replied, with no ordinary presence of mind, \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\r\nmy Lord Bullingdon is fighting the rebels against your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s crown\r\nin America. Does your Majesty desire that I should send another regiment\r\nto aid him?\xe2\x80\x99 On which the King turned on his heel, and I made my bow out\r\nof the presence-chamber. When Lady Lyndon kissed the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s hand at the\r\ndrawing-room, I found that precisely the same question had been put to\r\nher Ladyship; and she came home much agitated at the rebuke which had\r\nbeen administered to her. Thus it was that my loyalty was rewarded,\r\nand my sacrifice, in favour of my country, viewed! I took away my\r\nestablishment abruptly to Paris, where I met with a very different\r\nreception: but my stay amidst the enchanting pleasures of that capital\r\nwas extremely short; for the French Government, which had been long\r\ntampering with the American rebels, now openly acknowledged the\r\nindependence of the United States. A declaration of war ensued: all we\r\nhappy English were ordered away from Paris; and I think I left one\r\nor two fair ladies there inconsolable. It is the only place where a\r\ngentleman can live as he likes without being incommoded by his wife.\r\nThe Countess and I, during our stay, scarcely saw each other except upon\r\npublic occasions, at Versailles, or at the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s play-table; and our\r\ndear little Bryan advanced in a thousand elegant accomplishments which\r\nrendered him the delight of all who knew him.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to mention here my last interview with my good\r\nuncle, the Chevalier de Ballybarry, whom I left at Brussels with strong\r\nintentions of making his salut, as the phrase is, and who had gone into\r\nretirement at a convent there. Since then he had come into the world\r\nagain, much to his annoyance and repentance; having fallen desperately\r\nin love in his old age with a French actress, who had done, as most\r\nladies of her character do,--ruined him, left him, and laughed at him.\r\nHis repentance was very edifying. Under the guidance of Messieurs of the\r\nIrish College, he once more turned his thoughts towards religion; and\r\nhis only prayer to me when I saw him and asked in what I could relieve\r\nhim, was to pay a handsome fee to the convent into which he proposed to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nThis I could not, of course, do: my religious principles forbidding me\r\nto encourage superstition in any way; and the old gentleman and I parted\r\nrather coolly, in consequence of my refusal, as he said, to make his old\r\ndays comfortable.\r\n\r\nI was very poor at the time, that is the fact; and entre nous, the\r\nRosemont of the French Opera, an indifferent dancer, but a charming\r\nfigure and ankle, was ruining me in diamonds, equipages, and furniture\r\nbills, added to which I had a run of ill-luck at play, and was forced to\r\nmeet my losses by the most shameful sacrifices to the money-lenders, by\r\npawning part of Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s diamonds (that graceless little Rosemont\r\nwheedled me out of some of them), and by a thousand other schemes for\r\nraising money. But when Honour is in the case, was I ever found backward\r\nat her call: and what man can say that Barry Lyndon lost a bet which he\r\ndid not pay?\r\n\r\nAs for my ambitious hopes regarding the Irish peerage, I began, on my\r\nreturn, to find out that I had been led wildly astray by that rascal\r\nLord Crabs; who liked to take my money, but had no more influence to get\r\nme a coronet than to procure for me the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s tiara. The Sovereign was\r\nnot a whit more gracious to me on returning from the Continent than he\r\nhad been before my departure; and I had it from one of the aides-de-camp\r\nof the Royal Dukes his brothers, that my conduct and amusements at Paris\r\nhad been odiously misrepresented by some spies there, and had formed\r\nthe subject of Royal comment; and that the King had, influenced by these\r\ncalumnies, actually said I was the most disreputable man in the three\r\nkingdoms. I disreputable! I a dishonour to my name and country! When\r\nI heard these falsehoods, I was in such a rage that I went off to Lord\r\nNorth at once to remonstrate with the Minister; to insist upon being\r\nallowed to appear before His Majesty and clear myself of the imputations\r\nagainst me, to point out my services to the Government in voting with\r\nthem, and to ask when the reward that had been promised to me--viz., the\r\ntitle held by my ancestors--was again to be revived in my person?\r\n\r\nThere was a sleepy coolness in that fat Lord North which was the most\r\nprovoking thing that the Opposition had ever to encounter from him.\r\nHe heard me with half-shut eyes. When I had finished a long violent\r\nspeech--which I made striding about his room in Downing Street, and\r\ngesticulating with all the energy of an Irishman--he opened one eye,\r\nsmiled, and asked me gently if I had done. On my replying in the\r\naffirmative, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr. Barry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer you, point by point.\r\nThe King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know. Your claims,\r\nas you call them, HAVE been laid before him, and His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s gracious\r\nreply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and\r\nmerited a halter rather than a coronet. As for withdrawing your support\r\nfrom us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself and your vote\r\nwhithersoever you please. And now, as I have a great deal of occupation,\r\nperhaps you will do me the favour to retire.\xe2\x80\x99 So saying, he raised his\r\nhand lazily to the bell, and bowed me out; asking blandly if there was\r\nany other thing in the world in which he could oblige me.\r\n\r\nI went home in a fury which can\xe2\x80\x99t be described; and having Lord Crabs to\r\ndinner that day, assailed his Lordship by pulling his wig off his head,\r\nand smothering it in his face, and by attacking him in that part of the\r\nperson where, according to report, he had been formerly assaulted by\r\nMajesty. The whole story was over the town the next day, and pictures\r\nof me were hanging in the clubs and print-shops performing the operation\r\nalluded to. All the town laughed at the picture of the lord and the\r\nIrishman, and, I need not say, recognised both. As for me, I was one of\r\nthe most celebrated characters in London in those days: my dress, style,\r\nand equipage being as well known as those of any leader of the fashion;\r\nand my popularity, if not great in the highest quarters, was at least\r\nconsiderable elsewhere. The people cheered me in the Gordon rows, at\r\nthe time they nearly killed my friend Jemmy Twitcher and burned Lord\r\nMansfield\xe2\x80\x99s house down. Indeed, I was known as a staunch Protestant, and\r\nafter my quarrel with Lord North veered right round to the Opposition,\r\nand vexed him with all the means in my power.\r\n\r\nThese were not, unluckily, very great, for I was a bad speaker, and the\r\nHouse would not listen to me, and presently, in 1780, after the Gordon\r\ndisturbance, was dissolved, when a general election took place. It came\r\non me, as all my mishaps were in the habit of coming, at a most unlucky\r\ntime. I was obliged to raise more money, at most ruinous rates, to face\r\nthe confounded election, and had the Tiptoffs against me in the field\r\nmore active and virulent than ever.\r\n\r\nMy blood boils even now when I think of the rascally conduct of my\r\nenemies in that scoundrelly election. I was held up as the Irish\r\nBluebeard, and libels of me were printed, and gross caricatures drawn\r\nrepresenting me flogging Lady Lyndon, whipping Lord Bullingdon, turning\r\nhim out of doors in a storm, and I know not what. There were pictures of\r\na pauper cabin in Ireland, from which it was pretended I came; others in\r\nwhich I was represented as a lacquey and shoeblack. A flood of calumny\r\nwas let loose upon me, in which any man of less spirit would have gone\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nBut though I met my accusers boldly, though I lavished sums of money in\r\nthe election, though I flung open Hackton Hall and kept champagne and\r\nBurgundy running there, and at all my inns in the town, as commonly as\r\nwater, the election went against me. The rascally gentry had all turned\r\nupon me and joined the Tiptoff faction: it was even represented that\r\nI held my wife by force; and though I sent her into the town alone,\r\nwearing my colours, with Bryan in her lap, and made her visit the\r\nmayor\xe2\x80\x99s lady and the chief women there, nothing would persuade the\r\npeople but that she lived in fear and trembling of me; and the brutal\r\nmob had the insolence to ask her why she dared to go back, and how she\r\nliked horsewhip for supper.\r\n\r\nI was thrown out of my election, and all the bills came down upon me\r\ntogether--all the bills I had been contracting during the years of my\r\nmarriage, which the creditors, with a rascally unanimity, sent in until\r\nthey lay upon my table in heaps. I won\xe2\x80\x99t cite their amount: it was\r\nfrightful. My stewards and lawyers made matters worse. I was bound up\r\nin an inextricable toil of bills and debts, of mortgages and insurances,\r\nand all the horrible evils attendant upon them. Lawyers upon lawyers\r\nposted down from London; composition after composition was made, and\r\nLady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s income hampered almost irretrievably to satisfy these\r\ncormorants. To do her justice, she behaved with tolerable kindness at\r\nthis season of trouble; for whenever I wanted money I had to coax\r\nher, and whenever I coaxed her I was sure of bringing this weak and\r\nlight-minded woman to good-humour: who was of such a weak terrified\r\nnature, that to secure an easy week with me she would sign away a\r\nthousand a year. And when my troubles began at Hackton, and I determined\r\non the only chance left, viz. to retire to Ireland and retrench,\r\nassigning over the best part of my income to the creditors until their\r\ndemands were met, my Lady was quite cheerful at the idea of going, and\r\nsaid, if we would be quiet, she had no doubt all would be well; indeed,\r\nwas glad to undergo the comparative poverty in which we must now live\r\nfor the sake of the retirement and the chance of domestic quiet which\r\nshe hoped to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe went off to Bristol pretty suddenly, leaving the odious and\r\nungrateful wretches at Hackton to vilify us, no doubt, in our absence.\r\nMy stud and hounds were sold off immediately; the harpies would have\r\nbeen glad to pounce upon my person; but that was out of their power.\r\nI had raised, by cleverness and management, to the full as much on my\r\nmines and private estates as they were worth; so the scoundrels were\r\ndisappointed in THIS instance; and as for the plate and property in the\r\nLondon house, they could not touch that, as it was the property of the\r\nheirs of the house of Lyndon.\r\n\r\nI passed over to Ireland, then, and took up my abode at Castle Lyndon\r\nfor a while; all the world imagining that I was an utterly ruined man,\r\nand that the famous and dashing Barry Lyndon would never again appear in\r\nthe circles of which he had been an ornament. But it was not so. In the\r\nmidst of my perplexities, Fortune reserved a great consolation for me\r\nstill. Despatches came home from America announcing Lord Cornwallis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndefeat of General Gates in Carolina, and the death of Lord Bullingdon,\r\nwho was present as a volunteer.\r\n\r\nFor my own desires to possess a paltry Irish title I cared little. My\r\nson was now heir to an English earldom, and I made him assume forthwith\r\nthe title of Lord Viscount Castle Lyndon, the third of the family\r\ntitles. My mother went almost mad with joy at saluting her grandson as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 and I felt that all my sufferings and privations were repaid\r\nby seeing this darling child advanced to such a post of honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIf the world were not composed of a race of ungrateful scoundrels, who\r\nshare your prosperity while it lasts, and, even when gorged with your\r\nvenison and Burgundy, abuse the generous giver of the feast, I am sure I\r\nmerit a good name and a high reputation: in Ireland, at least, where\r\nmy generosity was unbounded, and the splendour of my mansion and\r\nentertainments unequalled by any other nobleman of my time. As long as\r\nmy magnificence lasted, all the country was free to partake of it; I had\r\nhunters sufficient in my stables to mount a regiment of dragoons, and\r\nbutts of wine in my cellar which would have made whole counties drunk\r\nfor years. Castle Lyndon became the headquarters of scores of needy\r\ngentlemen, and I never rode a-hunting but I had a dozen young fellows of\r\nthe best blood of the country riding as my squires and gentlemen of\r\nthe horse. My son, little Castle Lyndon, was a prince; his breeding and\r\nmanners, even at his early age, showed him to be worthy of the two noble\r\nfamilies from whom he was descended: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what high hopes I had\r\nfor the boy, and indulged in a thousand fond anticipations as to his\r\nfuture success and figure in the world. But stern Fate had determined\r\nthat I should leave none of my race behind me, and ordained that I\r\nshould finish my career, as I see it closing now--poor, lonely, and\r\nchildless. I may have had my faults; but no man shall dare to say of me\r\nthat I was not a good and tender father. I loved that boy passionately;\r\nperhaps with a blind partiality: I denied him nothing. Gladly, gladly,\r\nI swear, would I have died that his premature doom might have been\r\naverted. I think there is not a day since I lost him but his bright face\r\nand beautiful smiles look down on me out of heaven, where he is, and\r\nthat my heart does not yearn towards him. That sweet child was taken\r\nfrom me at the age of nine years, when he was full of beauty and\r\npromise: and so powerful is the hold his memory has of me that I have\r\nnever been able to forget him; his little spirit haunts me of nights\r\non my restless solitary pillow; many a time, in the wildest and maddest\r\ncompany, as the bottle is going round, and the song and laugh roaring\r\nabout, I am thinking of him. I have got a lock of his soft brown hair\r\nhanging round my breast now: it will accompany me to the dishonoured\r\npauper\xe2\x80\x99s grave; where soon, no doubt, Barry Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s worn-out old bones\r\nwill be laid.\r\n\r\nMy Bryan was a boy of amazing high spirit (indeed how, coming from such\r\na stock, could he be otherwise?), impatient even of my control, against\r\nwhich the dear little rogue would often rebel gallantly; how much more,\r\nthen, of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s and the women\xe2\x80\x99s, whose attempts to direct him he\r\nwould laugh to scorn. Even my own mother [\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Barry of Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ngood soul now called herself, in compliment to my new family) was quite\r\nunable to check him; and hence you may fancy what a will he had of his\r\nown. If it had not been for that, he might have lived to this day: he\r\nmight--but why repine? Is he not in a better place? would the heritage\r\nof a beggar do any service to him? It is best as it is--Heaven be good\r\nto us!--Alas! that I, his father, should be left to deplore him.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of October I had been to Dublin, in order to see a\r\nlawyer and a moneyed man who had come over to Ireland to consult with me\r\nabout some sales of mine and the cut of Hackton timber; of which, as I\r\nhated the place and was greatly in want of money, I was determined to\r\ncut down every stick. There had been some difficulty in the matter. It\r\nwas said I had no right to touch the timber. The brute peasantry about\r\nthe estate had been roused to such a pitch of hatred against me, that\r\nthe rascals actually refused to lay an axe to the trees; and my agent\r\n(that scoundrel Larkins) declared that his life was in danger among\r\nthem if he attempted any further despoilment (as they called it) of the\r\nproperty. Every article of the splendid furniture was sold by this time,\r\nas I need not say; and as for the plate, I had taken good care to bring\r\nit off to Ireland, where it now was in the best of keeping--my banker\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwho had advanced six thousand pounds on it: which sum I soon had\r\noccasion for.\r\n\r\nI went to Dublin, then, to meet the English man of business; and so\r\nfar succeeded in persuading Mr. Splint, a great shipbuilder and\r\ntimber-dealer of Plymouth, of my claim to the Hackton timber, that he\r\nagreed to purchase it off-hand at about one-third of its value, and\r\nhanded me over five thousand pounds: which, being pressed with debts at\r\nthe time, I was fain to accept. HE had no difficulty in getting down the\r\nwood, I warrant. He took a regiment of shipwrights and sawyers from his\r\nown and the King\xe2\x80\x99s yards at Plymouth, and in two months Hackton Park was\r\nas bare of trees as the Bog of Allen.\r\n\r\nI had but ill luck with that accursed expedition and money. I lost the\r\ngreater part of it in two nights\xe2\x80\x99 play at \xe2\x80\x98Daly\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 so that my debts\r\nstood just as they were before; and before the vessel sailed for\r\nHolyhead, which carried away my old sharper of a timber-merchant, all\r\nthat I had left of the money he brought me was a couple of hundred\r\npounds, with which I returned home very disconsolately: and very\r\nsuddenly, too, for my Dublin tradesmen were hot upon me, hearing I had\r\nspent the loan, and two of my wine-merchants had writs out against me\r\nfor some thousands of pounds.\r\n\r\nI bought in Dublin, according to my promise, however--for when I give\r\na promise I will keep it at any sacrifices--a little horse for my dear\r\nlittle Bryan; which was to be a present for his tenth birthday, that was\r\nnow coming on: it was a beautiful little animal and stood me in a good\r\nsum. I never regarded money for that dear child. But the horse was very\r\nwild. He kicked off one of my horse-boys, who rode him at first, and\r\nbroke the lad\xe2\x80\x99s leg; and, though I took the animal in hand on the\r\njourney home, it was only my weight and skill that made the brute quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home I sent the horse away with one of my grooms to a\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s house, to break him thoroughly in, and told Bryan, who was all\r\nanxiety to see his little horse, that he would arrive by his birthday,\r\nwhen he should hunt him along with my hounds; and I promised myself\r\nno small pleasure in presenting the dear fellow to the field that day:\r\nwhich I hoped to see him lead some time or other in place of his fond\r\nfather. Ah me! never was that gallant boy to ride a fox-chase, or to\r\ntake the place amongst the gentry of his country which his birth and\r\ngenius had pointed out for him!\r\n\r\nThough I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in dreams and omens, yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t but own that\r\nwhen a great calamity is hanging over a man he has frequently many\r\nstrange and awful forebodings of it. I fancy now I had many. Lady\r\nLyndon, especially, twice dreamed of her son\xe2\x80\x99s death; but, as she was\r\nnow grown uncommonly nervous and vapourish, I treated her fears with\r\nscorn, and my own, of course, too. And in an unguarded moment, over the\r\nbottle after dinner, I told poor Bryan, who was always questioning me\r\nabout the little horse, and when it was to come, that it was arrived;\r\nthat it was in Doolan\xe2\x80\x99s farm, where Mick the groom was breaking him in.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Promise me, Bryan,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed his mother, \xe2\x80\x98that you will not ride the\r\nhorse except in company of your father.\xe2\x80\x99 But I only said, \xe2\x80\x98Pooh, madam,\r\nyou are an ass!\xe2\x80\x99 being angry at her silly timidity, which was always\r\nshowing itself in a thousand disagreeable ways now; and, turning round\r\nto Bryan, said, \xe2\x80\x98I promise your Lordship a good flogging if you mount\r\nhim without my leave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI suppose the poor child did not care about paying this penalty for the\r\npleasure he was to have, or possibly thought a fond father would remit\r\nthe punishment altogether; for the next morning, when I rose rather\r\nlate, having sat up drinking the night before, I found the child had\r\nbeen off at daybreak, having slipt through his tutor\xe2\x80\x99s room (this was\r\nRedmond Quin, our cousin, whom I had taken to live with me), and I had\r\nno doubt but that he was gone to Doolan\xe2\x80\x99s farm.\r\n\r\nI took a great horsewhip and galloped off after him in a rage, swearing\r\nI would keep my promise. But, Heaven forgive me! I little thought of it\r\nwhen at three miles from home I met a sad procession coming towards me:\r\npeasants moaning and howling as our Irish do, the black horse led by the\r\nhand, and, on a door that some of the folk carried, my poor dear dear\r\nlittle boy. There he lay in his little boots and spurs, and his little\r\ncoat of scarlet and gold. His dear face was quite white, and he smiled\r\nas he held a hand out to me, and said painfully, \xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t whip me,\r\nwill you, papa?\xe2\x80\x99 I could only burst out into tears in reply. I have seen\r\nmany and many a man dying, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a look about the eyes which you\r\ncannot mistake. There was a little drummer-boy I was fond of who was hit\r\ndown before my company at Kuhnersdorf; when I ran up to give him\r\nsome water, he looked exactly like my dear Bryan then did--there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nmistaking that awful look of the eyes. We carried him home and scoured\r\nthe country round for doctors to come and look at his hurt.\r\n\r\nBut what does a doctor avail in a contest with the grim invincible\r\nenemy? Such as came could only confirm our despair by their account\r\nof the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s case. He had mounted his horse gallantly, sat him\r\nbravely all the time the animal plunged and kicked, and, having overcome\r\nhis first spite, ran him at a hedge by the roadside. But there were\r\nloose stones at the top, and the horse\xe2\x80\x99s foot caught among them, and he\r\nand his brave little rider rolled over together at the other side. The\r\npeople said they saw the noble little boy spring up after his fall and\r\nrun to catch the horse; which had broken away from him, kicking him on\r\nthe back, as it would seem, as they lay on the ground. Poor Bryan ran a\r\nfew yards and then dropped down as if shot. A pallor came over his face,\r\nand they thought he was dead. But they poured whisky down his mouth, and\r\nthe poor child revived: still he could not move; his spine was injured;\r\nthe lower half of him was dead when they laid him in bed at home. The\r\nrest did not last long, God help me! He remained yet for two days with\r\nus; and a sad comfort it was to think he was in no pain.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the dear angel\xe2\x80\x99s temper seemed quite to change: he\r\nasked his mother and me pardon for any act of disobedience he had been\r\nguilty of towards us; he said often he should like to see his brother\r\nBullingdon. \xe2\x80\x98Bully was better than you, papa,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98he used not\r\nto swear so, and he told and taught me many good things while you were\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x99 And, taking a hand of his mother and mine in each of his little\r\nclammy ones, he begged us not to quarrel so, but love each other, so\r\nthat we might meet again in heaven, where Bully told him quarrelsome\r\npeople never went. His mother was very much affected by these\r\nadmonitions from the poor suffering angel\xe2\x80\x99s mouth; and I was so too. I\r\nwish she had enabled me to keep the counsel which the dying boy gave us.\r\n\r\nAt last, after two days, he died. There he lay, the hope of my family,\r\nthe pride of my manhood, the link which had kept me and my Lady Lyndon\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Redmond,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, kneeling by the sweet child\xe2\x80\x99s body,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98do, do let us listen to the truth out of his blessed mouth: and do you\r\namend your life, and treat your poor loving fond wife as her dying child\r\nbade you.\xe2\x80\x99 And I said I would: but there are promises which it is out of\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s power to keep; especially with such a woman as her. But we\r\ndrew together after that sad event, and were for several months better\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you with what splendour we buried him. Of what avail are\r\nundertakers\xe2\x80\x99 feathers and heralds\xe2\x80\x99 trumpery? I went out and shot the\r\nfatal black horse that had killed him, at the door of the vault where we\r\nlaid my boy. I was so wild, that I could have shot myself too. But for\r\nthe crime, it would have been better that I should, perhaps; for what\r\nhas my life been since that sweet flower was taken out of my bosom?\r\nA succession of miseries, wrongs, disasters, and mental and bodily\r\nsufferings which never fell to the lot of any other man in Christendom.\r\n\r\nLady Lyndon, always vapourish and nervous, after our blessed boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncatastrophe became more agitated than ever, and plunged into devotion\r\nwith so much fervour, that you would have fancied her almost distracted\r\nat times. She imagined she saw visions. She said an angel from heaven\r\nhad told her that Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s death was as a punishment to her for her\r\nneglect of her first-born. Then she would declare Bullingdon was alive;\r\nshe had seen him in a dream. Then again she would fall into fits of\r\nsorrow about his death, and grieve for him as violently as if he had\r\nbeen the last of her sons who had died, and not our darling Bryan; who,\r\ncompared to Bullingdon, was what a diamond is to a vulgar stone. Her\r\nfreaks were painful to witness, and difficult to control. It began to\r\nbe said in the country that the Countess was going mad. My scoundrelly\r\nenemies did not fail to confirm and magnify the rumour, and would add\r\nthat I was the cause of her insanity: I had driven her to distraction, I\r\nhad killed Bullingdon, I had murdered my own son; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else\r\nthey laid to my charge. Even in Ireland their hateful calumnies reached\r\nme: my friends fell away from me. They began to desert my hunt, as they\r\ndid in England, and when I went to race or market found sudden reasons\r\nfor getting out of my neighbourhood. I got the name of Wicked Barry,\r\nDevil Lyndon, which you please: the country-folk used to make marvellous\r\nlegends about me: the priests said I had massacred I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nmany German nuns in the Seven Years\xe2\x80\x99 War; that the ghost of the murdered\r\nBullingdon haunted my house. Once at a fair in a town hard by, when I\r\nhad a mind to buy a waistcoat for one of my people, a fellow standing by\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a strait-waistcoat he\xe2\x80\x99s buying for my Lady Lyndon.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nfrom this circumstance arose a legend of my cruelty to my wife; and many\r\ncircumstantial details were narrated regarding my manner and ingenuity\r\nof torturing her.\r\n\r\nThe loss of my dear boy pressed not only on my heart as a father, but\r\ninjured my individual interests in a very considerable degree; for as\r\nthere was now no direct heir to the estate, and Lady Lyndon was of a\r\nweak health, and supposed to be quite unlikely to leave a family, the\r\nnext in succession-that detestable family of Tiptoff--began to exert\r\nthemselves in a hundred ways to annoy me, and were at the head of\r\nthe party of enemies who were raising reports to my discredit. They\r\ninterposed between me and my management of the property in a hundred\r\ndifferent ways; making an outcry if I cut a stick, sunk a shaft, sold a\r\npicture, or sent a few ounces of plate to be remodelled. They harassed\r\nme with ceaseless lawsuits, got injunctions from Chancery, hampered my\r\nagents in the execution of their work; so much so that you would have\r\nfancied my own was not my own, but theirs, to do as they liked with.\r\nWhat is worse, as I have reason to believe, they had tamperings and\r\ndealings with my own domestics under my own roof; for I could not have\r\na word with Lady Lyndon but it somehow got abroad, and I could not be\r\ndrunk with my chaplain and friends but some sanctified rascals would\r\nget hold of the news, and reckon up all the bottles I drank and all the\r\noaths I swore. That these were not few, I acknowledge. I am of the old\r\nschool; was always a free liver and speaker; and, at least, if I did and\r\nsaid what I liked, was not so bad as many a canting scoundrel I know of\r\nwho covers his foibles and sins, unsuspected, with a mask of holiness.\r\nAs I am making a clean breast of it, and am no hypocrite, I may as well\r\nconfess now that I endeavoured to ward off the devices of my enemies\r\nby an artifice which was not, perhaps, strictly justifiable. Everything\r\ndepended on my having an heir to the estate; for if Lady Lyndon, who\r\nwas of weakly health, had died, the next day I was a beggar: all my\r\nsacrifices of money, &c., on the estate would not have been held in a\r\nfarthing\xe2\x80\x99s account; all the debts would have been left on my shoulders;\r\nand my enemies would have triumphed over me: which, to a man of my\r\nhonourable spirit, was \xe2\x80\x98the unkindest cut of all,\xe2\x80\x99 as some poet says.\r\n\r\nI confess, then, it was my wish to supplant these scoundrels; and, as I\r\ncould not do so without an heir to my property, _I_ DETERMINED TO FIND\r\nONE. If I had him near at hand, and of my own blood too, though with\r\nthe bar sinister, is not here the question. It was then I found out the\r\nrascally machinations of my enemies; for, having broached this plan to\r\nLady Lyndon, whom I made to be, outwardly at least, the most obedient\r\nof wives,--although I never let a letter from her or to her go or arrive\r\nwithout my inspection,--although I allowed her to see none but those\r\npersons who I thought, in her delicate health, would be fitting society\r\nfor her; yet the infernal Tiptoffs got wind of my scheme, protested\r\ninstantly against it, not only by letter, but in the shameful libellous\r\npublic prints, and held me up to public odium as a \xe2\x80\x98child-forger,\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\nthey called me. Of course I denied the charge--I could do no otherwise,\r\nand offered to meet any one of the Tiptoffs on the field of honour, and\r\nprove him a scoundrel and a liar: as he was; though, perhaps, not\r\nin this instance. But they contented themselves by answering me by a\r\nlawyer, and declined an invitation which any man of spirit would have\r\naccepted. My hopes of having an heir were thus blighted completely:\r\nindeed, Lady Lyndon (though, as I have said, I take her opposition for\r\nnothing) had resisted the proposal with as much energy as a woman of her\r\nweakness could manifest; and said she had committed one great crime in\r\nconsequence of me, but would rather die than perform another. I could\r\neasily have brought her Ladyship to her senses, however: but my scheme\r\nhad taken wind, and it was now in vain to attempt it. We might have had\r\na dozen children in honest wedlock, and people would have said they were\r\nfalse.\r\n\r\nAs for raising money on annuities, I may say I had used her life\r\ninterest up. There were but few of those assurance societies in my time\r\nwhich have since sprung up in the city of London; underwriters did\r\nthe business, and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s life was as well known among them as, I do\r\nbelieve, that of any woman in Christendom. Latterly, when I wanted to\r\nget a sum against her life, the rascals had the impudence to say my\r\ntreatment of her did not render it worth a year\xe2\x80\x99s purchase,--as if my\r\ninterest lay in killing her! Had my boy lived, it would have been a\r\ndifferent thing; he and his mother might have cut off the entail of a\r\ngood part of the property between them, and my affairs have been put in\r\nbetter order. Now they were in a bad condition indeed. All my schemes\r\nhad turned out failures; my lands, which I had purchased with borrowed\r\nmoney, made me no return, and I was obliged to pay ruinous interest for\r\nthe sums with which I had purchased them. My income, though very large,\r\nwas saddled with hundreds of annuities, and thousands of lawyers\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncharges; and I felt the net drawing closer and closer round me, and no\r\nmeans to extricate myself from its toils.\r\n\r\nTo add to all my perplexities, two years after my poor child\xe2\x80\x99s death, my\r\nwife, whose vagaries of temper and wayward follies I had borne with for\r\ntwelve years, wanted to leave me, and absolutely made attempts at what\r\nshe called escaping from my tyranny.\r\n\r\nMy mother, who was the only person that, in my misfortunes, remained\r\nfaithful to me (indeed, she has always spoken of me in my true light, as\r\na martyr to the rascality of others and a victim of my own generous and\r\nconfiding temper), found out the first scheme that was going on; and\r\nof which those artful and malicious Tiptoffs were, as usual, the main\r\npromoters. Mrs. Barry, indeed, though her temper was violent and her\r\nways singular, was an invaluable person to me in my house; which would\r\nhave been at rack and ruin long before, but for her spirit of order\r\nand management, and for her excellent economy in the government of my\r\nnumerous family. As for my Lady Lyndon, she, poor soul! was much too\r\nfine a lady to attend to household matters--passed her days with her\r\ndoctor, or her books of piety, and never appeared among us except at my\r\ncompulsion; when she and my mother would be sure to have a quarrel.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barry, on the contrary, had a talent for management in all matters.\r\nShe kept the maids stirring, and the footmen to their duty; had an eye\r\nover the claret in the cellar, and the oats and hay in the stable; saw\r\nto the salting and pickling, the potatoes and the turf-stacking, the\r\npig-killing and the poultry, the linen-room and the bakehouse, and the\r\nten thousand minutiae of a great establishment. If all Irish housewives\r\nwere like her, I warrant many a hall-fire would be blazing where the\r\ncobwebs only grow now, and many a park covered with sheep and fat cattle\r\nwhere the thistles are at present the chief occupiers. If anything\r\ncould have saved me from the consequences of villainy in others, and\r\n(I confess it, for I am not above owning to my faults) my own too easy,\r\ngenerous, and careless nature, it would have been the admirable prudence\r\nof that worthy creature. She never went to bed until all the house was\r\nquiet and all the candles out; and you may fancy that this was a matter\r\nof some difficulty with a man of my habits, who had commonly a dozen of\r\njovial fellows (artful scoundrels and false friends most of them were!)\r\nto drink with me every night, and who seldom, for my part, went to bed\r\nsober. Many and many a night, when I was unconscious of her attention,\r\nhas that good soul pulled my boots off, and seen me laid by my servants\r\nsnug in bed, and carried off the candle herself; and been the first\r\nin the morning, too, to bring me my drink of small-beer. Mine were no\r\nmilksop times, I can tell you. A gentleman thought no shame of taking\r\nhis half-dozen bottles; and, as for your coffee and slops, they were\r\nleft to Lady Lyndon, her doctor, and the other old women. It was my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s pride that I could drink more than any man in the country,--as\r\nmuch, within a pint, as my father before me, she said.\r\n\r\nThat Lady Lyndon should detest her was quite natural. She is not the\r\nfirst of woman or mankind either that has hated a mother-in-law. I set\r\nmy mother to keep a sharp watch over the freaks of her Ladyship; and\r\nthis, you may be sure, was one of the reasons why the latter disliked\r\nher. I never minded that, however. Mrs. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s assistance and\r\nsurveillance were invaluable to me; and, if I had paid twenty spies\r\nto watch my Lady, I should not have been half so well served as by the\r\ndisinterested care and watchfulness of my excellent mother. She slept\r\nwith the house-keys under her pillow, and had an eye everywhere. She\r\nfollowed all the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s movements like a shadow; she managed to\r\nknow, from morning to night, everything that my Lady did. If she walked\r\nin the garden, a watchful eye was kept on the wicket; and if she chose\r\nto drive out, Mrs. Barry accompanied her, and a couple of fellows in my\r\nliveries rode alongside of the carriage to see that she came to no harm.\r\nThough she objected, and would have kept her room in sullen silence,\r\nI made a point that we should appear together at church in the\r\ncoach-and-six every Sunday; and that she should attend the race-balls\r\nin my company, whenever the coast was clear of the rascally bailiffs who\r\nbeset me. This gave the lie to any of those maligners who said I wished\r\nto make a prisoner of my wife. The fact is, that, knowing her levity,\r\nand seeing the insane dislike to me and mine which had now begun to\r\nsupersede what, perhaps, had been an equally insane fondness for me, I\r\nwas bound to be on my guard that she should not give me the slip. Had\r\nshe left me, I was ruined the next day. This (which my mother knew)\r\ncompelled us to keep a tight watch over her; but as for imprisoning her,\r\nI repel the imputation with scorn. Every man imprisons his wife to a\r\ncertain degree; the world would be in a pretty condition if women were\r\nallowed to quit home and return to it whenever they had a mind. In\r\nwatching over my wife, Lady Lyndon, I did no more than exercise the\r\nlegitimate authority which awards honour and obedience to every husband.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, is female artifice, that, in spite of all my watchfulness\r\nin guarding her, it is probable my Lady would have given me the slip,\r\nhad I not had quite as acute a person as herself as my ally: for, as\r\nthe proverb says that \xe2\x80\x98the best way to catch one thief is to set another\r\nafter him,\xe2\x80\x99 so the best way to get the better of a woman is to engage\r\none of her own artful sex to guard her. One would have thought that,\r\nfollowed as she was, all her letters read, and all her acquaintances\r\nstrictly watched by me, living in a remote part of Ireland away from her\r\nfamily, Lady Lyndon could have had no chance of communicating with\r\nher allies, or of making her wrongs, as she was pleased to call them,\r\npublic; and yet, for a while, she carried on a correspondence under my\r\nvery nose, and acutely organised a conspiracy for flying from me; as\r\nshall be told.\r\n\r\nShe always had an inordinate passion for dress, and, as she was never\r\nthwarted in any whimsey she had of this kind (for I spared no money to\r\ngratify her, and among my debts are milliners\xe2\x80\x99 bills to the amount of\r\nmany thousands), boxes used to pass continually to and fro from Dublin,\r\nwith all sorts of dresses, caps, flounces, and furbelows, as her fancy\r\ndictated. With these would come letters from her milliner, in answer to\r\nnumerous similar injunctions from my Lady; all of which passed through\r\nmy hands, without the least suspicion, for some time. And yet in these\r\nvery papers, by the easy means of sympathetic ink, were contained all\r\nher Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence; and Heaven knows (for it was some time,\r\nas I have said, before I discovered the trick) what charges against me.\r\n\r\nBut clever Mrs. Barry found out that always before my lady-wife chose to\r\nwrite letters to her milliner, she had need of lemons to make her drink,\r\nas she said; this fact, being mentioned to me, set me a-thinking, and\r\nso I tried one of the letters before the fire, and the whole scheme\r\nof villainy was brought to light. I will give a specimen of one of the\r\nhorrid artful letters of this unhappy woman. In a great hand, with wide\r\nlines, were written a set of directions to her mantua-maker, setting\r\nforth the articles of dress for which my Lady had need, the peculiarity\r\nof their make, the stuff she selected, &c. She would make out long lists\r\nin this way, writing each article in a separate line, so as to have more\r\nspace for detailing all my cruelties and her tremendous wrongs. Between\r\nthese lines she kept the journal of her captivity: it would have made\r\nthe fortune of a romance-writer in those days but to have got a copy of\r\nit, and to have published it under the title of the \xe2\x80\x98Lovely Prisoner,\r\nor the Savage Husband,\xe2\x80\x99 or by some name equally taking and absurd. The\r\njournal would be as follows:--\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MONDAY.--Yesterday I was made to go to church. My odious, MONSTROUS,\r\nVULGAR SHE-DRAGON OF A MOTHER-IN-LAW, in a yellow satin and red ribands,\r\ntaking the first place in the coach; Mr. L. riding by its side, on the\r\nhorse he never paid for to Captain Hurdlestone. The wicked hypocrite led\r\nme to the pew, with hat in hand and a smiling countenance, and kissed\r\nmy hand as I entered the coach after service, and patted my Italian\r\ngreyhound--all that the few people collected might see. He made me\r\ncome downstairs in the evening to make tea for his company; of whom\r\nthree-fourths, he himself included, were, as usual, drunk. They painted\r\nthe parson\xe2\x80\x99s face black, when his reverence had arrived at his seventh\r\nbottle; and at his usual insensible stage, they tied him on the grey\r\nmare with his face to the tail. The she-dragon read the \xe2\x80\x9cWhole Duty of\r\nMan\xe2\x80\x9d all the evening till bedtime; when she saw me to my apartments,\r\nlocked me in, and proceeded to wait upon her abominable son: whom she\r\nadores for his wickedness, I should think, AS STYCORAX DID CALIBAN.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nYou should have seen my mother\xe2\x80\x99s fury as I read her out this passage!\r\nIndeed, I have always had a taste for a joke (that practised on the\r\nparson, as described above, is, I confess, a true bill), and used\r\ncarefully to select for Mrs. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s hearing all the COMPLIMENTS that\r\nLady Lyndon passed upon her. The dragon was the name by which she was\r\nknown in this precious correspondence: or sometimes she was designated\r\nby the title of the \xe2\x80\x98Irish Witch.\xe2\x80\x99 As for me, I was denominated \xe2\x80\x98my\r\ngaoler,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98my tyrant,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98the dark spirit which has obtained the mastery\r\nover my being,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on; in terms always complimentary to my power,\r\nhowever little they might be so to my amiability. Here is another\r\nextract from her \xe2\x80\x98Prison Diary,\xe2\x80\x99 by which it will be seen that my Lady,\r\nalthough she pretended to be so indifferent to my goings on, had a sharp\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and could be as jealous as another:--\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98WEDNESDAY.--This day two years my last hope and pleasure in life was\r\ntaken from me, and my dear child was called to heaven. Has he joined his\r\nneglected brother there, whom I suffered to grow up unheeded by my side:\r\nand whom the tyranny of the monster to whom I am united drove to exile,\r\nand perhaps to death? Or is the child alive, as my fond heart sometimes\r\ndeems? Charles Bullingdon! come to the aid of a wretched mother, who\r\nacknowledges her crimes, her coldness towards thee, and now bitterly\r\npays for her error! But no, he cannot live! I am distracted! My only\r\nhope is in you, my cousin--you whom I had once thought to salute by a\r\nSTILL FONDER TITLE, my dear George Poynings! Oh, be my knight and my\r\npreserver, the true chivalric being thou ever wert, and rescue me from\r\nthe thrall of the felon caitiff who holds me captive--rescue me from\r\nhim, and from Stycorax, the vile Irish witch, his mother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Here follow some verses, such as her Ladyship was in the habit of\r\ncomposing by reams, in which she compares herself to Sabra, in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seven Champions,\xe2\x80\x99 and beseeches her George to rescue her from THE\r\nDRAGON, meaning Mrs. Barry. I omit the lines, and proceed:)--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even my poor child, who perished untimely on this sad anniversary, the\r\ntyrant who governs me had taught to despise and dislike me. \xe2\x80\x98Twas\r\nin disobedience to my orders, my prayers, that he went on the fatal\r\njourney. What sufferings, what humiliations have I had to endure since\r\nthen! I am a prisoner in my own halls. I should fear poison, but that I\r\nknow the wretch has a sordid interest in keeping me alive, and that my\r\ndeath would be the signal for his ruin. But I dare not stir without my\r\nodious, hideous, vulgar gaoler, the horrid Irishwoman, who pursues my\r\nevery step. I am locked into my chamber at night, like a felon, and\r\nonly suffered to leave it when ORDERED into the presence of my lord (_I_\r\nordered!), to be present at his orgies with his boon companions, and\r\nto hear his odious converse as he lapses into the disgusting madness of\r\nintoxication! He has given up even the semblance of constancy--he, who\r\nswore that I alone could attach or charm him! And now he brings\r\nhis vulgar mistresses before my very eyes, and would have had me\r\nacknowledge, as heir to my own property, his child by another!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I never will submit! Thou, and thou only, my George, my early\r\nfriend, shalt be heir to the estates of Lyndon. Why did not Fate join me\r\nto thee, instead of to the odious man who holds me under his sway, and\r\nmake the poor Calista happy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nSo the letters would run on for sheets upon sheets, in the closest\r\ncramped handwriting; and I leave any unprejudiced reader to say whether\r\nthe writer of such documents must not have been as silly and vain a\r\ncreature as ever lived, and whether she did not want being taken care\r\nof? I could copy out yards of rhapsody to Lord George Poynings, her old\r\nflame, in which she addressed him by the most affectionate names, and\r\nimplored him to find a refuge for her against her oppressors; but they\r\nwould fatigue the reader to peruse, as they would me to copy. The fact\r\nis, that this unlucky lady had the knack of writing a great deal more\r\nthan she meant. She was always reading novels and trash; putting\r\nherself into imaginary characters and flying off into heroics and\r\nsentimentalities with as little heart as any woman I ever knew; yet\r\nshowing the most violent disposition to be in love. She wrote always as\r\nif she was in a flame of passion. I have an elegy on her lap-dog, the\r\nmost tender and pathetic piece she ever wrote; and most tender notes\r\nof remonstrance to Betty, her favourite maid; to her housekeeper, on\r\nquarrelling with her; to half-a-dozen acquaintances, each of whom she\r\naddressed as the dearest friend in the world, and forgot the very moment\r\nshe took up another fancy. As for her love for her children, the above\r\npassage will show how much she was capable of true maternal feeling:\r\nthe very sentence in which she records the death of one child serves\r\nto betray her egotisms, and to wreak her spleen against myself; and she\r\nonly wishes to recall another from the grave, in order that he may be of\r\nsome personal advantage to her. If I DID deal severely with this woman,\r\nkeeping her from her flatterers who would have bred discord between us,\r\nand locking her up out of mischief, who shall say that I was wrong? If\r\nany woman deserved a strait-waistcoat,--it was my Lady Lyndon; and I\r\nhave known people in my time manacled, and with their heads shaved, in\r\nthe straw, who had not committed half the follies of that foolish, vain,\r\ninfatuated creature.\r\n\r\nMy mother was so enraged by the charges against me and herself which\r\nthese letters contained, that it was with the utmost difficulty I could\r\nkeep her from discovering our knowledge of them to Lady Lyndon; whom it\r\nwas, of course, my object to keep in ignorance of our knowledge of her\r\ndesigns: for I was anxious to know how far they went, and to what pitch\r\nof artifice she would go. The letters increased in interest (as they say\r\nof the novels) as they proceeded. Pictures were drawn of my treatment\r\nof her which would make your heart throb. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of what\r\nmonstrosities she did not accuse me, and what miseries and starvation\r\nshe did not profess herself to undergo; all the while she was living\r\nexceedingly fat and contented, to outward appearances, at our house at\r\nCastle Lyndon. Novel-reading and vanity had turned her brain. I could\r\nnot say a rough word to her (and she merited many thousands a day, I\r\ncan tell you), but she declared I was putting her to the torture; and\r\nmy mother could not remonstrate with her but she went off into a fit of\r\nhysterics, of which she would declare the worthy old lady was the cause.\r\n\r\nAt last she began to threaten to kill herself; and though I by no means\r\nkept the cutlery out of the way, did not stint her in garters, and left\r\nher doctor\xe2\x80\x99s shop at her entire service,--knowing her character full\r\nwell, and that there was no woman in Christendom less likely to lay\r\nhands on her precious life than herself; yet these threats had an\r\neffect, evidently, in the quarter to which they were addressed; for the\r\nmilliner\xe2\x80\x99s packets now began to arrive with great frequency, and the\r\nbills sent to her contained assurances of coming aid. The chivalrous\r\nLord George Poynings was coming to his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s rescue, and did me\r\nthe compliment to say that he hoped to free his dear cousin from the\r\nclutches of the most atrocious villain that ever disgraced humanity; and\r\nthat, when she was free, measures should be taken for a divorce, on the\r\nground of cruelty and every species of ill-usage on my part.\r\n\r\nI had copies of all these precious documents on one side and the other\r\ncarefully made, by my beforementioned relative, godson, and secretary,\r\nMr. Redmond Quin at present the WORTHY agent of the Castle Lyndon\r\nproperty. This was a son of my old flame Nora, whom I had taken from her\r\nin a fit of generosity; promising to care for his education at Trinity\r\nCollege, and provide for him through life. But after the lad had been\r\nfor a year at the University, the tutors would not admit him to commons\r\nor lectures until his college bills were paid; and, offended by this\r\ninsolent manner of demanding the paltry sum due, I withdrew my patronage\r\nfrom the place, and ordered my gentleman to Castle Lyndon; where I made\r\nhim useful to me in a hundred ways. In my dear little boy\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime,\r\nhe tutored the poor child as far as his high spirit would let him; but\r\nI promise you it was small trouble poor dear Bryan ever gave the\r\nbooks. Then he kept Mrs. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s accounts; copied my own interminable\r\ncorrespondence with my lawyers and the agents of all my various\r\nproperty; took a hand at piquet or backgammon of evenings with me and\r\nmy mother; or, being an ingenious lad enough (though of a mean boorish\r\nspirit, as became the son of such a father), accompanied my Lady\r\nLyndon\xe2\x80\x99s spinet with his flageolet; or read French and Italian with her:\r\nin both of which languages her Ladyship was a fine scholar, and with\r\nwhich he also became conversant. It would make my watchful old mother\r\nvery angry to hear them conversing in these languages; for, not\r\nunderstanding a word of either of them, Mrs. Barry was furious when they\r\nwere spoken, and always said it was some scheming they were after. It\r\nwas Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s constant way of annoying the old lady, when the three\r\nwere alone together, to address Quin in one or other of these tongues.\r\n\r\nI was perfectly at ease with regard to his fidelity, for I had bred the\r\nlad, and loaded him with benefits; and, besides, had had various proofs\r\nof his trustworthiness. He it was who brought me three of Lord George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters, in reply to some of my Lady\xe2\x80\x99s complaints; which were concealed\r\nbetween the leather and the boards of a book which was sent from the\r\ncirculating library for her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s perusal. He and my Lady too had\r\nfrequent quarrels. She mimicked his gait in her pleasanter moments;\r\nin her haughty moods, she would not sit down to table with a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrandson. \xe2\x80\x98Send me anything for company but that odious Quin,\xe2\x80\x99 she would\r\nsay, when I proposed that he should go and amuse her with his books and\r\nhis flute; for, quarrelsome as we were, it must not be supposed we were\r\nalways at it: I was occasionally attentive to her. We would be friends\r\nfor a month together, sometimes; then we would quarrel for a fortnight;\r\nthen she would keep her apartments for a month: all of which domestic\r\ncircumstances were noted down, in her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar way, in her\r\njournal of captivity, as she called it; and a pretty document it is!\r\nSometimes she writes, \xe2\x80\x98My monster has been almost kind to-day;\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nruffian has deigned to smile.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she will break out into expressions\r\nof savage hate; but for my poor mother it was ALWAYS hatred. It was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The she-dragon is sick to-day; I wish to Heaven she would die!\xe2\x80\x99 or,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The hideous old Irish basketwoman has been treating me to some of her\r\nBillingsgate to-day,\xe2\x80\x99 and so forth: all which expressions, read to Mrs.\r\nBarry, or translated from the French and Italian, in which many of them\r\nwere written, did not fail to keep the old lady in a perpetual fury\r\nagainst her charge: and so I had my watch-dog, as I called her, always\r\non the alert. In translating these languages, young Quin was of great\r\nservice to me; for I had a smattering of French--and High Dutch, when I\r\nwas in the army, of course, I knew well--but Italian I knew nothing of,\r\nand was glad of the services of so faithful and cheap an interpreter.\r\n\r\nThis cheap and faithful interpreter, this godson and kinsman, on whom\r\nand on whose family I had piled up benefits, was actually trying to\r\nbetray me; and for several months, at least, was in league with the\r\nenemy against me. I believe that the reason why they did not move\r\nearlier was the want of the great mover of all treasons--money: of\r\nwhich, in all parts of my establishment, there was a woful scarcity; but\r\nof this they also managed to get a supply through my rascal of a godson,\r\nwho could come and go quite unsuspected: the whole scheme was arranged\r\nunder our very noses, and the post-chaise ordered, and the means of\r\nescape actually got ready; while I never suspected their design.\r\n\r\nA mere accident made me acquainted with their plan. One of my colliers\r\nhad a pretty daughter; and this pretty lass had for her bachelor, as\r\nthey call them in Ireland, a certain lad, who brought the letter-bag\r\nfor Castle Lyndon (and many a dunning letter for me was there in it, God\r\nwot!): this letter-boy told his sweetheart how he brought a bag of money\r\nfrom the town for Master Quin; and how that Tim the post-boy had told\r\nhim that he was to bring a chaise down to the water at a certain hour.\r\nMiss Rooney, who had no secrets from me, blurted out the whole story;\r\nasked me what scheming I was after, and what poor unlucky girl I was\r\ngoing to carry away with the chaise I had ordered, and bribe with the\r\nmoney I had got from town?\r\n\r\nThen the whole secret flashed upon me, that the man I had cherished in\r\nmy bosom was going to betray me. I thought at one time of catching the\r\ncouple in the act of escape, half drowning them in the ferry which they\r\nhad to cross to get to their chaise, and of pistolling the young traitor\r\nbefore Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; but, on second thoughts, it was quite clear\r\nthat the news of the escape would make a noise through the country, and\r\nrouse the confounded justice\xe2\x80\x99s people about my ears, and bring me no\r\ngood in the end. So I was obliged to smother my just indignation, and\r\nto content myself by crushing the foul conspiracy, just at the moment it\r\nwas about to be hatched.\r\n\r\nI went home, and in half-an-hour, and with a few of my terrible looks, I\r\nhad Lady Lyndon on her knees, begging me to forgive her; confessing\r\nall and everything; ready to vow and swear she would never make such an\r\nattempt again; and declaring that she was fifty times on the point of\r\nowning everything to me, but that she feared my wrath against the poor\r\nyoung lad her accomplice: who was indeed the author and inventor of\r\nall the mischief. This--though I knew how entirely false the statement\r\nwas--I was fain to pretend to believe; so I begged her to write to her\r\ncousin, Lord George, who had supplied her with money, as she admitted,\r\nand with whom the plan had been arranged, stating, briefly, that she had\r\naltered her mind as to the trip to the country proposed; and that, as\r\nher dear husband was rather in delicate health, she preferred to stay at\r\nhome and nurse him. I added a dry postscript, in which I stated that it\r\nwould give me great pleasure if his Lordship would come and visit us\r\nat Castle Lyndon, and that I longed to renew an acquaintance which in\r\nformer times gave me so much satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x98I should seek him out,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI added, \xe2\x80\x98so soon as ever I was in his neighbourhood, and eagerly\r\nanticipated the pleasure of a meeting with him.\xe2\x80\x99 I think he must have\r\nunderstood my meaning perfectly well; which was, that I would run him\r\nthrough the body on the very first occasion I could come at him.\r\n\r\nThen I had a scene with my perfidious rascal of a nephew; in which the\r\nyoung reprobate showed an audacity and a spirit for which I was quite\r\nunprepared. When I taxed him with ingratitude, \xe2\x80\x98What do I owe you?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe. \xe2\x80\x98I have toiled for you as no man ever did for another, and worked\r\nwithout a penny of wages. It was you yourself who set me against you,\r\nby giving me a task against which my soul revolted,--by making me a spy\r\nover your unfortunate wife, whose weakness is as pitiable as are her\r\nmisfortunes and your rascally treatment of her. Flesh and blood could\r\nnot bear to see the manner in which you used her. I tried to help her\r\nto escape from you; and I would do it again, if the opportunity offered,\r\nand so I tell you to your teeth!\xe2\x80\x99 When I offered to blow his brains out\r\nfor his insolence, \xe2\x80\x98Pooh!\xe2\x80\x99 said he,--\xe2\x80\x98kill the man who saved your poor\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s life once, and who was endeavouring to keep him out of the\r\nruin and perdition into which a wicked father was leading him, when a\r\nMerciful Power interposed, and withdrew him from this house of crime? I\r\nwould have left you months ago, but I hoped for some chance of rescuing\r\nthis unhappy lady. I swore I would try, the day I saw you strike her.\r\nKill me, you woman\xe2\x80\x99s bully! You would if you dared; but you have not the\r\nheart. Your very servants like me better than you. Touch me, and they\r\nwill rise and send you to the gallows you merit!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI interrupted this neat speech by sending a water-bottle at the young\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s head, which felled him to the ground; and then I went to\r\nmeditate upon what he had said to me. It was true the fellow had saved\r\npoor little Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s life, and the boy to his dying day was tenderly\r\nattached to him. \xe2\x80\x98Be good to Redmond, papa,\xe2\x80\x99 were almost the last words\r\nhe spoke; and I promised the poor child, on his death-bed, that I would\r\ndo as he asked. It was also true, that rough usage of him would be\r\nlittle liked by my people, with whom he had managed to become a great\r\nfavourite: for, somehow, though I got drunk with the rascals often, and\r\nwas much more familiar with them than a man of my rank commonly is,\r\nyet I knew I was by no means liked by them; and the scoundrels were\r\nmurmuring against me perpetually.\r\n\r\nBut I might have spared myself the trouble of debating what his fate\r\nshould be, for the young gentleman took the disposal of it out of my\r\nhands in the simplest way in the world: viz. by washing and binding up\r\nhis head so soon as he came to himself: by taking his horse from the\r\nstables; and, as he was quite free to go in and out of the house and\r\npark as he liked, he disappeared without the least let or hindrance;\r\nand leaving the horse behind him at the ferry, went off in the very\r\npost-chaise which was waiting for Lady Lyndon. I saw and heard no more\r\nof him for a considerable time; and now that he was out of the house,\r\ndid not consider him a very troublesome enemy.\r\n\r\nBut the cunning artifice of woman is such that, I think, in the long\r\nrun, no man, were he Machiavel himself, could escape from it; and\r\nthough I had ample proofs in the above transaction (in which my wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfidious designs were frustrated by my foresight), and under her own\r\nhandwriting, of the deceitfulness of her character and her hatred\r\nfor me, yet she actually managed to deceive me, in spite of all my\r\nprecautions and the vigilance of my mother in my behalf. Had I followed\r\nthat good lady\xe2\x80\x99s advice, who scented the danger from afar off, as it\r\nwere, I should never have fallen into the snare prepared for me; and\r\nwhich was laid in a way that was as successful as it was simple.\r\n\r\nMy Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s relation with me was a singular one. Her life was\r\npassed in a crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred\r\nfor me. If I was in a good-humour with her (as occurred sometimes) there\r\nwas nothing she would not do to propitiate me further; and she would\r\nbe as absurd and violent in her expressions of fondness as, at other\r\nmoments, she would be in her demonstrations of hatred. It is not your\r\nfeeble easy husbands who are loved best in the world; according to my\r\nexperience of it. I do think the women like a little violence of temper,\r\nand think no worse of a husband who exercises his authority pretty\r\nsmartly. I had got my Lady into such a terror about me, that when I\r\nsmiled, it was quite an era of happiness to her; and if I beckoned to\r\nher, she would come fawning up to me like a dog. I recollect how, for\r\nthe few days I was at school, the cowardly mean-spirited fellows would\r\nlaugh if ever our schoolmaster made a joke. It was the same in\r\nthe regiment whenever the bully of a sergeant was disposed to be\r\njocular--not a recruit but was on the broad grin. Well, a wise and\r\ndetermined husband will get his wife into this condition of discipline;\r\nand I brought my high-born wife to kiss my hand, to pull off my boots,\r\nto fetch and carry for me like a servant, and always to make it a\r\nholiday, too, when I was in good-humour. I confided perhaps too much\r\nin the duration of this disciplined obedience, and forgot that the very\r\nhypocrisy which forms a part of it (all timid people are liars in their\r\nhearts) may be exerted in a way that may be far from agreeable, in order\r\nto deceive you.\r\n\r\nAfter the ill-success of her last adventure, which gave me endless\r\nopportunities to banter her, one would have thought I might have been on\r\nmy guard as to what her real intentions were; but she managed to mislead\r\nme with an art of dissimulation quite admirable, and lulled me into a\r\nfatal security with regard to her intentions: for, one day, as I was\r\njoking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again,\r\nwhether she had found another lover, and so forth, she suddenly burst\r\ninto tears, and, seizing hold of my hand, cried passionately out,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Barry, you know well enough that I have never loved but you! Was I\r\never so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy! ever\r\nso angry, but the least offer of goodwill on your part did not bring me\r\nto your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for\r\nyou, in bestowing one of the first fortunes in England upon you? Have I\r\nrepined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you\r\ntoo much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment\r\nI saw you, I felt irresistibly attracted towards you. I saw your bad\r\nqualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving\r\nyou. I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so;\r\nand in spite of reason and duty. What sacrifice do you want from me? I\r\nam ready to make any, so you will but love me; or, if not, that at least\r\nyou will gently use me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was in a particularly good humour that day, and we had a sort of\r\nreconciliation: though my mother, when she heard the speech, and saw me\r\nsoftening towards her Ladyship, warned me solemnly, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Depend\r\non it, the artful hussy has some other scheme in her head now.\xe2\x80\x99 The old\r\nlady was right; and I swallowed the bait which her Ladyship had prepared\r\nto entrap me as simply as any gudgeon takes a hook.\r\n\r\nI had been trying to negotiate with a man for some money, for which I\r\nhad pressing occasion; but since our dispute regarding the affair of\r\nthe succession, my Lady had resolutely refused to sign any papers for my\r\nadvantage: and without her name, I am sorry to say, my own was of little\r\nvalue in the market, and I could not get a guinea from any money-dealer\r\nin London or Dublin. Nor could I get the rascals from the latter place\r\nto visit me at Castle Lyndon: owing to that unlucky affair I had with\r\nLawyer Sharp when I made him lend me the money he brought down, and\r\nold Salmon the Jew being robbed of the bond I gave him after leaving my\r\nhouse, [Footnote: These exploits of Mr. Lyndon are not related in the\r\nnarrative. He probably, in the cases above alluded to, took the law into\r\nhis own hands.] the people would not trust themselves within my walls\r\nany more. Our rents, too, were in the hands of receivers by this time,\r\nand it was as much as I could do to get enough money from the rascals to\r\npay my wine-merchants their bills. Our English property, as I have\r\nsaid, was equally hampered; and, as often as I applied to my lawyers and\r\nagents for money, would come a reply demanding money of me, for debts\r\nand pretended claims which the rapacious rascals said they had on me.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, with some feelings of pleasure that I got a letter from\r\nmy confidential man in Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, London, saying (in reply to some\r\nninety-ninth demand of mine) that he thought he could get me some money;\r\nand inclosing a letter from a respectable firm in the city of London,\r\nconnected with the mining interest, which offered to redeem the\r\nincumbrance in taking a long lease of certain property of ours, which\r\nwas still pretty free, upon the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s signature; and provided they\r\ncould be assured of her free will in giving it. They said they heard\r\nshe lived in terror of her life from me, and meditated a separation, in\r\nwhich case she might repudiate any deeds signed by her while in durance,\r\nand subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation;\r\nand demanded to be made assured of her Ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s perfect free will in\r\nthe transaction before they advanced a shilling of their capital.\r\n\r\nTheir terms were so exorbitant, that I saw at once their offer must be\r\nsincere; and, as my Lady was in her gracious mood, had no difficulty in\r\npersuading her to write a letter, in her own hand, declaring that the\r\naccounts of our misunderstandings were utter calumnies; that we lived\r\nin perfect union, and that she was quite ready to execute any deed which\r\nher husband might desire her to sign.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was a very timely one, and filled me with great hopes.\r\nI have not pestered my readers with many accounts of my debts and law\r\naffairs; which were by this time so vast and complicated that I never\r\nthoroughly knew them myself, and was rendered half wild by their\r\nurgency. Suffice it to say, my money was gone--my credit was done. I was\r\nliving at Castle Lyndon off my own beef and mutton, and the bread, turf,\r\nand potatoes off my own estate: I had to watch Lady Lyndon within, and\r\nthe bailiffs without. For the last two years, since I went to Dublin\r\nto receive money (which I unluckily lost at play there, to the\r\ndisappointment of my creditors), I did not venture to show in that city:\r\nand could only appear at our own county town at rare intervals, and\r\nbecause I knew the sheriffs: whom I swore I would murder if any ill\r\nchance happened to me. A chance of a good loan, then, was the most\r\nwelcome prospect possible to me, and I hailed it with all the eagerness\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s letter, came, in course of time, an answer\r\nfrom the confounded London merchants, stating that if her Ladyship\r\nwould confirm by word of mouth, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane,\r\nLondon, the statement of her letter, they, having surveyed her property,\r\nwould no doubt come to terms; but they declined incurring the risk of\r\na visit to Castle Lyndon to negotiate, as they were aware how other\r\nrespectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salmon of Dublin,\r\nhad been treated there. This was a hit at me; but there are certain\r\nsituations in which people can\xe2\x80\x99t dictate their own terms: and, \xe2\x80\x98faith,\r\nI was so pressed now for money, that I could have signed a bond with Old\r\nNick himself, if he had come provided with a good round sum.\r\n\r\nI resolved to go and take the Countess to London. It was in vain that\r\nmy mother prayed and warned me. \xe2\x80\x98Depend on it,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98there is some\r\nartifice. When once you get into that wicked town, you are not safe.\r\nHere you may live for years and years, in luxury and splendour, barring\r\nclaret and all the windows broken; but as soon as they have you in\r\nLondon, they\xe2\x80\x99ll get the better of my poor innocent lad; and the first\r\nthing I shall hear of you will be, that you are in trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why go, Redmond?\xe2\x80\x99 said my wife. \xe2\x80\x98I am happy here, as long as you are\r\nkind to me, as you are now. We can\xe2\x80\x99t appear in London as we ought; the\r\nlittle money you will get will be spent, like all the rest has been.\r\nLet us turn shepherd and shepherdess, and look to our flocks and be\r\ncontent.\xe2\x80\x99 And she took my hand and kissed it; while my mother only said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Humph! I believe she\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom of it--the wicked SCHAMER!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI told my wife she was a fool; bade Mrs. Barry not be uneasy, and was\r\nhot upon going: I would take no denial from either party. How I was to\r\nget the money to go was the question; but that was solved by my good\r\nmother, who was always ready to help me on a pinch, and who produced\r\nsixty guineas from a stocking. This was all the ready money that Barry\r\nLyndon, of Castle Lyndon, and married to a fortune of forty thousand a\r\nyear, could command: such had been the havoc made in this fine fortune\r\nby my own extravagance (as I must confess), but chiefly by my misplaced\r\nconfidence and the rascality of others.\r\n\r\nWe did not start in state, you may be sure. We did not let the country\r\nknow we were going, or leave notice of adieu with our neighbours. The\r\nfamous Mr. Barry Lyndon and his noble wife travelled in a hack-chaise\r\nand pair to Waterford, under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Jones, and thence\r\ntook shipping for Bristol, where we arrived quite without accident. When\r\na man is going to the deuce, how easy and pleasant the journey is! The\r\nthought of the money quite put me in a good humour, and my wife, as she\r\nlay on my shoulder in the post-chaise going to London, said it was the\r\nhappiest ride she had taken since our marriage.\r\n\r\nOne night we stayed at Reading, whence I despatched a note to my agent\r\nat Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, saying I would be with him during the day, and begging\r\nhim to procure me a lodging, and to hasten the preparations for the\r\nloan. My Lady and I agreed that we would go to France, and wait there\r\nfor better times; and that night, over our supper, formed a score of\r\nplans both for pleasure and retrenchment. You would have thought it\r\nwas Darby and Joan together over their supper. O woman! woman! when I\r\nrecollect Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s smiles and blandishments--how happy she seemed\r\nto be on that night! what an air of innocent confidence appeared in\r\nher behaviour, and what affectionate names she called me!--I am lost\r\nin wonder at the depth of her hypocrisy. Who can be surprised that an\r\nunsuspecting person like myself should have been a victim to such a\r\nconsummate deceiver!\r\n\r\nWe were in London at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and half-an-hour before the time\r\nappointed our chaise drove to Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. I easily found out Mr.\r\nTapewell\xe2\x80\x99s apartments--a gloomy den it was, and in an unlucky hour I\r\nentered it! As we went up the dirty back-stair, lighted by a feeble lamp\r\nand the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon, my wife seemed agitated\r\nand faint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Redmond,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, as we got up to the door, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t go in: I am\r\nsure there is danger. There\xe2\x80\x99s time yet; let us go back--to\r\nIreland--anywhere!\xe2\x80\x99 And she put herself before the door, in one of her\r\ntheatrical attitudes, and took my hand.\r\n\r\nI just pushed her away to one side. \xe2\x80\x98Lady Lyndon,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98you are an\r\nold fool!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old fool!\xe2\x80\x99 said she; and she jumped at the bell, which was quickly\r\nanswered by a mouldy-looking gentleman in an unpowdered wig, to whom she\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x98Say Lady Lyndon is here;\xe2\x80\x99 and stalked down the passage muttering\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old fool.\xe2\x80\x99 It was \xe2\x80\x98OLD\xe2\x80\x99 which was the epithet that touched her. I might\r\ncall her anything but that.\r\n\r\nMr. Tapewell was in his musty room, surrounded by his parchments and tin\r\nboxes. He advanced and bowed; begged her Ladyship to be seated; pointed\r\ntowards a chair for me, which I took, rather wondering at his insolence;\r\nand then retreated to a side-door, saying he would be back in one\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAnd back he DID come in one moment, bringing with him--whom do you\r\nthink? Another lawyer, six constables in red waistcoats with bludgeons\r\nand pistols, my Lord George Poynings, and his aunt Lady Jane Peckover.\r\n\r\nWhen my Lady Lyndon saw her old flame, she flung herself into his arms\r\nin an hysterical passion. She called him her saviour, her preserver,\r\nher gallant knight; and then, turning round to me, poured out a flood of\r\ninvective which quite astonished me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old fool as I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I have outwitted the most crafty and\r\ntreacherous monster under the sun. Yes, I WAS a fool when I married you,\r\nand gave up other and nobler hearts for your sake--yes, I was a fool\r\nwhen I forgot my name and lineage to unite myself with a base-born\r\nadventurer--a fool to bear, without repining, the most monstrous tyranny\r\nthat ever woman suffered; to allow my property to be squandered; to see\r\nwomen, as base and low-born as yourself\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, be calm!\xe2\x80\x99 cries the lawyer; and then bounded back\r\nbehind the constables, seeing a threatening look in my eye which the\r\nrascal did not like. Indeed. I could have torn him to pieces, had he\r\ncome near me. Meanwhile, my Lady continued in a strain of incoherent\r\nfury; screaming against me, and against my mother especially, upon whom\r\nshe heaped abuse worthy of Billingsgate, and always beginning and ending\r\nthe sentence with the word fool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t tell all, my Lady,\xe2\x80\x99 says I bitterly; \xe2\x80\x98I said OLD fool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt you said and did, sir, everything that a blackguard\r\ncould say or do,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed little Poynings. \xe2\x80\x98This lady is now safe\r\nunder the protection of her relations and the law, and need fear your\r\ninfamous persecutions no longer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But YOU are not safe,\xe2\x80\x99 roared I; \xe2\x80\x98and, as sure as I am a man of honour,\r\nand have tasted your blood once, I will have your heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take down his words, constables: swear the peace against him!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed\r\nthe little lawyer, from behind his tipstaffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would not sully my sword with the blood of such a ruffian,\xe2\x80\x99 cried my\r\nLord, relying on the same doughty protection. \xe2\x80\x98If the scoundrel remains\r\nin London another day, he will be seized as a common swindler.\xe2\x80\x99 And this\r\nthreat indeed made me wince; for I knew that there were scores of writs\r\nout against me in town, and that once in prison my case was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s the man will seize me!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted I, drawing my sword, and\r\nplacing my back to the door. \xe2\x80\x98Let the scoundrel come. You--you cowardly\r\nbraggart, come first, if you have the soul of a man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to seize you!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lawyer; my Ladyship, her aunt,\r\nand a division of the bailiffs moving off as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x98My dear sir, we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to seize you: we will give you a handsome sum to leave the\r\ncountry; only leave her Ladyship in peace!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the country will be well rid of such a villain!\xe2\x80\x99 says my Lord,\r\nretreating too, and not sorry to get out of my reach: and the scoundrel\r\nof a lawyer followed him, leaving me in possession of the apartment, and\r\nin company of the bullies from the police-office, who were all armed to\r\nthe teeth. I was no longer the man I was at twenty, when I should have\r\ncharged the ruffians sword in hand, and have sent at least one of them\r\nto his account. I was broken in spirit; regularly caught in the toils:\r\nutterly baffled and beaten by that woman. Was she relenting at the door,\r\nwhen she paused and begged me turn back? Had she not a lingering love\r\nfor me still? Her conduct showed it, as I came to reflect on it. It was\r\nmy only chance now left in the world, so I put down my sword upon the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I shall use no violence; you may tell Mr. Tapewell\r\nI am quite ready to speak with him when he is at leisure!\xe2\x80\x99 and I sat\r\ndown and folded my arms quite peaceably. What a change from the Barry\r\nLyndon of old days! but, as I have read in an old book about Hannibal\r\nthe Carthaginian general, when he invaded the Romans, his troops, which\r\nwere the most gallant in the world, and carried all before them, went\r\ninto cantonments in some city where they were so sated with the\r\nluxuries and pleasures of life, that they were easily beaten in the next\r\ncampaign. It was so with me now. My strength of mind and body were no\r\nlonger those of the brave youth who shot his man at fifteen, and fought\r\na score of battles within six years afterwards. Now, in the Fleet\r\nPrison, where I write this, there is a small man who is always jeering\r\nme and making game of me; who asks me to fight, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\ncourage to touch him. But I am anticipating the gloomy and wretched\r\nevents of my history of humiliation, and had better proceed in order.\r\n\r\nI took a lodging in a coffee-house near Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn; taking care to\r\ninform Mr. Tapewell of my whereabouts, and anxiously expecting a visit\r\nfrom him. He came and brought me the terms which Lady Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s friends\r\nproposed-a paltry annuity of L300 a year; to be paid on the condition of\r\nmy remaining abroad out of the three kingdoms, and to be stopped on the\r\ninstant of my return. He told me what I very well knew, that my stay\r\nin London would infallibly plunge me in gaol; that there were writs\r\ninnumerable taken out against me here, and in the West of England; that\r\nmy credit was so blown upon that I could not hope to raise a shilling;\r\nand he left me a night to consider of his proposal; saying that, if I\r\nrefused it, the family would proceed: if I acceded, a quarter\xe2\x80\x99s salary\r\nshould be paid to me at any foreign port I should prefer.\r\n\r\nWhat was the poor, lonely, and broken-hearted man to do? I took the\r\nannuity, and was declared outlaw in the course of next week. The rascal\r\nQuin had, I found, been, after all, the cause of my undoing. It was he\r\ndevised the scheme for bringing me up to London; sealing the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter with a seal which had been agreed upon between him and the\r\nCountess formerly: indeed he had always been for trying the plan, and\r\nhad proposed it at first; but her Ladyship, with her inordinate love of\r\nromance, preferred the project of elopement. Of these points my mother\r\nwrote me word in my lonely exile, offering at the same time to come over\r\nand share it with me; which proposal I declined. She left Castle Lyndon\r\na very short time after I had quitted it; and there was silence in that\r\nhall where, under my authority, had been exhibited so much hospitality\r\nand splendour. She thought she would never see me again, and bitterly\r\nreproached me for neglecting her; but she was mistaken in that, and in\r\nher estimate of me. She is very old, and is sitting by my side at this\r\nmoment in the prison, working: she has a bedroom in Fleet Market over\r\nthe way; and, with the fifty-pound annuity, which she has kept with\r\na wise prudence, we manage to eke out a miserable existence, quite\r\nunworthy of the famous and fashionable Barry Lyndon.\r\n\r\n Mr. Barry Lyndon\xe2\x80\x99s personal narrative finishes here, for the hand\r\nof death interrupted the ingenious author soon after the period at which\r\nthe Memoir was compiled; after he had lived nineteen years an inmate\r\nof the Fleet Prison, where the prison records state he died of delirium\r\ntremens. His mother attained a prodigious old age, and the inhabitants\r\nof the place in her time can record with accuracy the daily disputes\r\nwhich used to take place between mother and son; until the latter, from\r\nhabits of intoxication, falling into a state of almost imbecility,\r\nwas tended by his tough old parent as a baby almost, and would cry if\r\ndeprived of his necessary glass of brandy.\r\n\r\nHis life on the Continent we have not the means of following accurately;\r\nbut he appears to have resumed his former profession of a gambler,\r\nwithout his former success.\r\n\r\nHe returned secretly to England, after some time, and made an abortive\r\nattempt to extort money from Lord George Poynings, under a threat of\r\npublishing his correspondence with Lady Lyndon, and so preventing\r\nhis Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s match with Miss Driver, a great heiress, of strict\r\nprinciples, and immense property in slaves in the West Indies.\r\nBarry narrowly escaped being taken prisoner by the bailiffs who were\r\ndespatched after him by his lordship, who would have stopped his\r\npension; but Lady Lyndon would never consent to that act of justice,\r\nand, indeed, broke with my Lord George the very moment he married the\r\nWest India lady.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the old Countess thought her charms were perennial, and was\r\nnever out of love with her husband. She was living at Bath; her property\r\nbeing carefully nursed by her noble relatives the Tiptoffs, who were to\r\nsucceed to it in default of direct heirs: and such was the address of\r\nBarry, and the sway he still held over the woman, that he actually had\r\nalmost persuaded her to go and live with him again; when his plan and\r\nhers was interrupted by the appearance of a person who had been deemed\r\ndead for several years.\r\n\r\nThis was no other than Viscount Bullingdon, who started up to the\r\nsurprise of all; and especially to that of his kinsman of the house\r\nof Tiptoff. This young nobleman made his appearance at Bath, with\r\nthe letter from Barry to Lord George in his hand; in which the former\r\nthreatened to expose his connection with Lady Lyndon--a connection,\r\nwe need not state, which did not reflect the slightest dishonour upon\r\neither party, and only showed that her Ladyship was in the habit of\r\nwriting exceedingly foolish letters; as many ladies, nay gentlemen, have\r\ndone ere this. For calling the honour of his mother in question, Lord\r\nBullingdon assaulted his stepfather (living at Bath under the name of\r\nMr. Jones), and administered to him a tremendous castigation in the\r\nPump-Room.\r\n\r\nHis Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s history, since his departure, was a romantic one, which\r\nwe do not feel bound to narrate. He had been wounded in the American\r\nWar, reported dead, left prisoner, and escaped. The remittances which\r\nwere promised him were never sent; the thought of the neglect almost\r\nbroke the heart of the wild and romantic young man, and he determined to\r\nremain dead to the world at least, and to the mother who had denied\r\nhim. It was in the woods of Canada, and three years after the event had\r\noccurred, that he saw the death of his half-brother chronicled in\r\nthe Gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine, under the title of \xe2\x80\x98Fatal Accident to Lord\r\nViscount Castle Lyndon;\xe2\x80\x99 on which he determined to return to England:\r\nwhere, though he made himself known, it was with very great difficulty\r\nindeed that he satisfied Lord Tiptoff of the authenticity of his\r\nclaim. He was about to pay a visit to his lady mother at Bath, when\r\nhe recognised the well-known face of Mr. Barry Lyndon, in spite of the\r\nmodest disguise which that gentleman wore, and revenged upon his person\r\nthe insults of former days.\r\n\r\nLady Lyndon was furious when she heard of the rencounter; declined\r\nto see her son, and was for rushing at once to the arms of her adored\r\nBarry; but that gentleman had been carried off, meanwhile, from gaol to\r\ngaol, until he was lodged in the hands of Mr. Bendigo, of Chancery Lane,\r\nan assistant to the Sheriff of Middlesex; from whose house he went to\r\nthe Fleet Prison. The Sheriff and his assistant, the prisoner, nay, the\r\nprison itself, are now no more.\r\n\r\nAs long as Lady Lyndon lived, Barry enjoyed his income, and was perhaps\r\nas happy in prison as at any period of his existence; when her Ladyship\r\ndied, her successor sternly cut off the annuity, devoting the sum\r\nto charities: which, he said, would make a nobler use of it than the\r\nscoundrel who had enjoyed it hitherto. At his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s death, in the\r\nSpanish campaign, in the year 1811, his estate fell in to the family of\r\nthe Tiptoffs, and his title merged in their superior rank; but it does\r\nnot appear that the Marquis of Tiptoff (Lord George succeeded to the\r\ntitle on the demise of his brother) renewed either the pension of Mr.\r\nBarry or the charities which the late lord had endowed. The estate has\r\nvastly improved under his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s careful management. The trees in\r\nHackton Park are all about forty years old, and the Irish property is\r\nrented in exceedingly small farms to the peasantry; who still entertain\r\nthe stranger with stories of the daring and the devilry, and the\r\nwickedness and the fall of Barry Lyndon.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x80\x99s Barry Lyndon, by William Makepeace Thackeray\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BARRY LYNDON ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 4558-0.txt or 4558-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/5/5/4558/\r\n\r\nProduced by Steve Harris, Charles Franks and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
