He was throwing stones at howling urchins from Devil\'s Row who\r\nwere circling madly about the heap and pelting at him.\r\n\r\nHis infantile countenance was livid with fury.  His small body was\r\nwrithing in the delivery of great, crimson oaths.\r\n\r\n"Run, Jimmie, run!  Dey\'ll get yehs," screamed a retreating Rum Alley\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"Naw," responded Jimmie with a valiant roar, "dese micks can\'t make me\r\nrun."\r\n\r\nHowls of renewed wrath went up from Devil\'s Row throats.  Tattered\r\ngamins on the right made a furious assault on the gravel heap.  On\r\ntheir small, convulsed faces there shone the grins of true assassins.\r\nAs they charged, they threw stones and cursed in shrill chorus.\r\n\r\nThe little champion of Rum Alley stumbled precipitately down the other\r\nside.  His coat had been torn to shreds in a scuffle, and his hat was\r\ngone.  He had bruises on twenty parts of his body, and blood was\r\ndripping from a cut in his head.  His wan features wore a look of a\r\ntiny, insane demon.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, children from Devil\'s Row closed in on their antagonist.\r\nHe crooked his left arm defensively about his head and fought with\r\ncursing fury.  The little boys ran to and fro, dodging, hurling stones\r\nand swearing in barbaric trebles.\r\n\r\nFrom a window of an apartment house that upreared its form from amid\r\nsquat, ignorant stables, there leaned a curious woman.  Some laborers,\r\nunloading a scow at a dock at the river, paused for a moment and\r\nregarded the fight.  The engineer of a passive tugboat hung lazily to a\r\nrailing and watched.  Over on the Island, a worm of yellow convicts\r\ncame from the shadow of a building and crawled slowly along the river\'s\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nA stone had smashed into Jimmie\'s mouth.  Blood was bubbling over his\r\nchin and down upon his ragged shirt.  Tears made furrows on his\r\ndirt-stained cheeks.  His thin legs had begun to tremble and turn weak,\r\ncausing his small body to reel.  His roaring curses of the first part\r\nof the fight had changed to a blasphemous chatter.\r\n\r\nIn the yells of the whirling mob of Devil\'s Row children there were\r\nnotes of joy like songs of triumphant savagery.  The little boys seemed\r\nto leer gloatingly at the blood upon the other child\'s face.\r\n\r\nDown the avenue came boastfully sauntering a lad of sixteen years,\r\nalthough the chronic sneer of an ideal manhood already sat upon his\r\nlips.  His hat was tipped with an air of challenge over his eye.\r\nBetween his teeth, a cigar stump was tilted at the angle of defiance.\r\nHe walked with a certain swing of the shoulders which appalled the\r\ntimid.  He glanced over into the vacant lot in which the little raving\r\nboys from Devil\'s Row seethed about the shrieking and tearful child\r\nfrom Rum Alley.\r\n\r\n"Gee!" he murmured with interest.  "A scrap.  Gee!"\r\n\r\nHe strode over to the cursing circle, swinging his shoulders in a\r\nmanner which denoted that he held victory in his fists.  He approached\r\nat the back of one of the most deeply engaged of the Devil\'s Row\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"Ah, what deh hell," he said, and smote the deeply-engaged one on the\r\nback of the head.  The little boy fell to the ground and gave a hoarse,\r\ntremendous howl.  He scrambled to his feet, and perceiving, evidently,\r\nthe size of his assailant, ran quickly off, shouting alarms.  The\r\nentire Devil\'s Row party followed him.  They came to a stand a short\r\ndistance away and yelled taunting oaths at the boy with the chronic\r\nsneer.  The latter, momentarily, paid no attention to them.\r\n\r\n"What deh hell, Jimmie?" he asked of the small champion.\r\n\r\nJimmie wiped his blood-wet features with his sleeve.\r\n\r\n"Well, it was dis way, Pete, see!  I was goin\' teh lick dat Riley kid\r\nand dey all pitched on me."\r\n\r\nSome Rum Alley children now came forward.  The party stood for a moment\r\nexchanging vainglorious remarks with Devil\'s Row.  A few stones were\r\nthrown at long distances, and words of challenge passed between small\r\nwarriors.  Then the Rum Alley contingent turned slowly in the direction\r\nof their home street.  They began to give, each to each, distorted\r\nversions of the fight.  Causes of retreat in particular cases were\r\nmagnified.  Blows dealt in the fight were enlarged to catapultian\r\npower, and stones thrown were alleged to have hurtled with infinite\r\naccuracy.  Valor grew strong again, and the little boys began to swear\r\nwith great spirit.\r\n\r\n"Ah, we blokies kin lick deh hull damn Row," said a child, swaggering.\r\n\r\nLittle Jimmie was striving to stanch the flow of blood from his cut\r\nlips.  Scowling, he turned upon the speaker.\r\n\r\n"Ah, where deh hell was yeh when I was doin\' all deh fightin?" he\r\ndemanded.  "Youse kids makes me tired."\r\n\r\n"Ah, go ahn," replied the other argumentatively.\r\n\r\nJimmie replied with heavy contempt.  "Ah, youse can\'t fight, Blue\r\nBillie!  I kin lick yeh wid one han\'."\r\n\r\n"Ah, go ahn," replied Billie again.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Jimmie threateningly.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the other in the same tone.\r\n\r\nThey struck at each other, clinched, and rolled over on the cobble\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n"Smash \'im, Jimmie, kick deh damn guts out of \'im," yelled Pete, the\r\nlad with the chronic sneer, in tones of delight.\r\n\r\nThe small combatants pounded and kicked, scratched and tore.  They\r\nbegan to weep and their curses struggled in their throats with sobs.\r\nThe other little boys clasped their hands and wriggled their legs in\r\nexcitement.  They formed a bobbing circle about the pair.\r\n\r\nA tiny spectator was suddenly agitated.\r\n\r\n"Cheese it, Jimmie, cheese it!  Here comes yer fader," he yelled.\r\n\r\nThe circle of little boys instantly parted.  They drew away and waited\r\nin ecstatic awe for that which was about to happen.  The two little\r\nboys fighting in the modes of four thousand years ago, did not hear the\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nUp the avenue there plodded slowly a man with sullen eyes.  He was\r\ncarrying a dinner pail and smoking an apple-wood pipe.\r\n\r\nAs he neared the spot where the little boys strove, he regarded them\r\nlistlessly.  But suddenly he roared an oath and advanced upon the\r\nrolling fighters.\r\n\r\n"Here, you Jim, git up, now, while I belt yer life out, you damned\r\ndisorderly brat."\r\n\r\nHe began to kick into the chaotic mass on the ground.  The boy Billie\r\nfelt a heavy boot strike his head.  He made a furious effort and\r\ndisentangled himself from Jimmie.  He tottered away, damning.\r\n\r\nJimmie arose painfully from the ground and confronting his father,\r\nbegan to curse him.  His parent kicked him.  "Come home, now," he\r\ncried, "an\' stop yer jawin\', er I\'ll lam the everlasting head off yehs."\r\n\r\nThey departed.  The man paced placidly along with the apple-wood emblem\r\nof serenity between his teeth.  The boy followed a dozen feet in the\r\nrear.  He swore luridly, for he felt that it was degradation for one\r\nwho aimed to be some vague soldier, or a man of blood with a sort of\r\nsublime license, to be taken home by a father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nEventually they entered into a dark region where, from a careening\r\nbuilding, a dozen gruesome doorways gave up loads of babies to the\r\nstreet and the gutter.  A wind of early autumn raised yellow dust from\r\ncobbles and swirled it against an hundred windows.  Long streamers of\r\ngarments fluttered from fire-escapes.  In all unhandy places there were\r\nbuckets, brooms, rags and bottles.  In the street infants played or\r\nfought with other infants or sat stupidly in the way of vehicles.\r\nFormidable women, with uncombed hair and disordered dress, gossiped\r\nwhile leaning on railings, or screamed in frantic quarrels.  Withered\r\npersons, in curious postures of submission to something, sat smoking\r\npipes in obscure corners.  A thousand odors of cooking food came forth\r\nto the street.  The building quivered and creaked from the weight of\r\nhumanity stamping about in its bowels.\r\n\r\nA small ragged girl dragged a red, bawling infant along the crowded\r\nways.  He was hanging back, baby-like, bracing his wrinkled, bare legs.\r\n\r\nThe little girl cried out: "Ah, Tommie, come ahn.  Dere\'s Jimmie and\r\nfader.  Don\'t be a-pullin\' me back."\r\n\r\nShe jerked the baby\'s arm impatiently.  He fell on his face, roaring.\r\nWith a second jerk she pulled him to his feet, and they went on.  With\r\nthe obstinacy of his order, he protested against being dragged in a\r\nchosen direction.  He made heroic endeavors to keep on his legs,\r\ndenounce his sister and consume a bit of orange peeling which he chewed\r\nbetween the times of his infantile orations.\r\n\r\nAs the sullen-eyed man, followed by the blood-covered boy, drew near,\r\nthe little girl burst into reproachful cries.  "Ah, Jimmie, youse bin\r\nfightin\' agin."\r\n\r\nThe urchin swelled disdainfully.\r\n\r\n"Ah, what deh hell, Mag.  See?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl upbraided him,  "Youse allus fightin\', Jimmie, an\' yeh\r\nknows it puts mudder out when yehs come home half dead, an\' it\'s like\r\nwe\'ll all get a poundin\'."\r\n\r\nShe began to weep.  The babe threw back his head and roared at his\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\n"Ah, what deh hell!" cried Jimmie.  "Shut up er I\'ll smack yer mout\'.\r\nSee?"\r\n\r\nAs his sister continued her lamentations, he suddenly swore and struck\r\nher.  The little girl reeled and, recovering herself, burst into tears\r\nand quaveringly cursed him.  As she slowly retreated her brother\r\nadvanced dealing her cuffs.  The father heard and turned about.\r\n\r\n"Stop that, Jim, d\'yeh hear?  Leave yer sister alone on the street.\r\nIt\'s like I can never beat any sense into yer damned wooden head."\r\n\r\nThe urchin raised his voice in defiance to his parent and continued his\r\nattacks.  The babe bawled tremendously, protesting with great violence.\r\nDuring his sister\'s hasty manoeuvres, he was dragged by the arm.\r\n\r\nFinally the procession plunged into one of the gruesome doorways.  They\r\ncrawled up dark stairways and along cold, gloomy halls.  At last the\r\nfather pushed open a door and they entered a lighted room in which a\r\nlarge woman was rampant.\r\n\r\nShe stopped in a career from a seething stove to a pan-covered table.\r\nAs the father and children filed in she peered at them.\r\n\r\n"Eh, what?  Been fightin\' agin, by Gawd!"  She threw herself upon\r\nJimmie.  The urchin tried to dart behind the others and in the scuffle\r\nthe babe, Tommie, was knocked down.  He protested with his usual\r\nvehemence, because they had bruised his tender shins against a table\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nThe mother\'s massive shoulders heaved with anger.  Grasping the urchin\r\nby the neck and shoulder she shook him until he rattled.  She dragged\r\nhim to an unholy sink, and, soaking a rag in water, began to scrub his\r\nlacerated face with it.  Jimmie screamed in pain and tried to twist his\r\nshoulders out of the clasp of the huge arms.\r\n\r\nThe babe sat on the floor watching the scene, his face in contortions\r\nlike that of a woman at a tragedy.  The father, with a newly-ladened\r\npipe in his mouth, crouched on a backless chair near the stove.\r\nJimmie\'s cries annoyed him.  He turned about and bellowed at his wife:\r\n\r\n"Let the damned kid alone for a minute, will yeh, Mary?  Yer allus\r\npoundin\' \'im.  When I come nights I can\'t git no rest \'cause yer allus\r\npoundin\' a kid.  Let up, d\'yeh hear?  Don\'t be allus poundin\' a kid."\r\n\r\nThe woman\'s operations on the urchin instantly increased in violence.\r\nAt last she tossed him to a corner where he limply lay cursing and\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nThe wife put her immense hands on her hips and with a chieftain-like\r\nstride approached her husband.\r\n\r\n"Ho," she said, with a great grunt of contempt.  "An\' what in the devil\r\nare you stickin\' your nose for?"\r\n\r\nThe babe crawled under the table and, turning, peered out cautiously.\r\nThe ragged girl retreated and the urchin in the corner drew his legs\r\ncarefully beneath him.\r\n\r\nThe man puffed his pipe calmly and put his great mudded boots on the\r\nback part of the stove.\r\n\r\n"Go teh hell," he murmured, tranquilly.\r\n\r\nThe woman screamed and shook her fists before her husband\'s eyes.  The\r\nrough yellow of her face and neck flared suddenly crimson.  She began\r\nto howl.\r\n\r\nHe puffed imperturbably at his pipe for a time, but finally arose and\r\nbegan to look out at the window into the darkening chaos of back yards.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been drinkin\', Mary," he said.  "You\'d better let up on the\r\nbot\', ol\' woman, or you\'ll git done."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a liar.  I ain\'t had a drop," she roared in reply.\r\n\r\nThey had a lurid altercation, in which they damned each other\'s souls\r\nwith frequence.\r\n\r\nThe babe was staring out from under the table, his small face working\r\nin his excitement.\r\n\r\nThe ragged girl went stealthily over to the corner where the urchin lay.\r\n\r\n"Are yehs hurted much, Jimmie?" she whispered timidly.\r\n\r\n"Not a damn bit!  See?" growled the little boy.\r\n\r\n"Will I wash deh blood?"\r\n\r\n"Naw!"\r\n\r\n"Will I--"\r\n\r\n"When I catch dat Riley kid I\'ll break \'is face!  Dat\'s right!  See?"\r\n\r\nHe turned his face to the wall as if resolved to grimly bide his time.\r\n\r\nIn the quarrel between husband and wife, the woman was victor.  The man\r\ngrabbed his hat and rushed from the room, apparently determined upon a\r\nvengeful drunk.  She followed to the door and thundered at him as he\r\nmade his way down stairs.\r\n\r\nShe returned and stirred up the room until her children were bobbing\r\nabout like bubbles.\r\n\r\n"Git outa deh way," she persistently bawled, waving feet with their\r\ndishevelled shoes near the heads of her children.  She shrouded\r\nherself, puffing and snorting, in a cloud of steam at the stove, and\r\neventually extracted a frying-pan full of potatoes that hissed.\r\n\r\nShe flourished it.  "Come teh yer suppers, now," she cried with sudden\r\nexasperation.  "Hurry up, now, er I\'ll help yeh!"\r\n\r\nThe children scrambled hastily.  With prodigious clatter they arranged\r\nthemselves at table.  The babe sat with his feet dangling high from a\r\nprecarious infant chair and gorged his small stomach.  Jimmie forced,\r\nwith feverish rapidity, the grease-enveloped pieces between his wounded\r\nlips.  Maggie, with side glances of fear of interruption, ate like a\r\nsmall pursued tigress.\r\n\r\nThe mother sat blinking at them.  She delivered reproaches, swallowed\r\npotatoes and drank from a yellow-brown bottle.  After a time her mood\r\nchanged and she wept as she carried little Tommie into another room and\r\nlaid him to sleep with his fists doubled in an old quilt of faded red\r\nand green grandeur.  Then she came and moaned by the stove.  She rocked\r\nto and fro upon a chair, shedding tears and crooning miserably to the\r\ntwo children about their "poor mother" and "yer fader, damn \'is soul."\r\n\r\nThe little girl plodded between the table and the chair with a dish-pan\r\non it.  She tottered on her small legs beneath burdens of dishes.\r\n\r\nJimmie sat nursing his various wounds.  He cast furtive glances at his\r\nmother.  His practised eye perceived her gradually emerge from a\r\nmuddled mist of sentiment until her brain burned in drunken heat.  He\r\nsat breathless.\r\n\r\nMaggie broke a plate.\r\n\r\nThe mother started to her feet as if propelled.\r\n\r\n"Good Gawd," she howled.  Her eyes glittered on her child with sudden\r\nhatred.  The fervent red of her face turned almost to purple.  The\r\nlittle boy ran to the halls, shrieking like a monk in an earthquake.\r\n\r\nHe floundered about in darkness until he found the stairs.  He\r\nstumbled, panic-stricken, to the next floor.  An old woman opened a\r\ndoor.  A light behind her threw a flare on the urchin\'s quivering face.\r\n\r\n"Eh, Gawd, child, what is it dis time?  Is yer fader beatin\' yer\r\nmudder, or yer mudder beatin\' yer fader?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nJimmie and the old woman listened long in the hall.  Above the muffled\r\nroar of conversation, the dismal wailings of babies at night, the\r\nthumping of feet in unseen corridors and rooms, mingled with the sound\r\nof varied hoarse shoutings in the street and the rattling of wheels\r\nover cobbles, they heard the screams of the child and the roars of the\r\nmother die away to a feeble moaning and a subdued bass muttering.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was a gnarled and leathery personage who could don, at\r\nwill, an expression of great virtue.  She possessed a small music-box\r\ncapable of one tune, and a collection of "God bless yehs" pitched in\r\nassorted keys of fervency.  Each day she took a position upon the\r\nstones of Fifth Avenue, where she crooked her legs under her and\r\ncrouched immovable and hideous, like an idol.  She received daily a\r\nsmall sum in pennies.  It was contributed, for the most part, by\r\npersons who did not make their homes in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nOnce, when a lady had dropped her purse on the sidewalk, the gnarled\r\nwoman had grabbed it and smuggled it with great dexterity beneath her\r\ncloak.  When she was arrested she had cursed the lady into a partial\r\nswoon, and with her aged limbs, twisted from rheumatism, had almost\r\nkicked the stomach out of a huge policeman whose conduct upon that\r\noccasion she referred to when she said: "The police, damn \'em."\r\n\r\n"Eh, Jimmie, it\'s cursed shame," she said.  "Go, now, like a dear an\'\r\nbuy me a can, an\' if yer mudder raises \'ell all night yehs can sleep\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nJimmie took a tendered tin-pail and seven pennies and departed.  He\r\npassed into the side door of a saloon and went to the bar.  Straining\r\nup on his toes he raised the pail and pennies as high as his arms would\r\nlet him.  He saw two hands thrust down and take them.  Directly the\r\nsame hands let down the filled pail and he left.\r\n\r\nIn front of the gruesome doorway he met a lurching figure.  It was his\r\nfather, swaying about on uncertain legs.\r\n\r\n"Give me deh can.  See?" said the man, threateningly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, come off!  I got dis can fer dat ol\' woman an\' it \'ud be dirt teh\r\nswipe it.  See?" cried Jimmie.\r\n\r\nThe father wrenched the pail from the urchin.  He grasped it in both\r\nhands and lifted it to his mouth.  He glued his lips to the under edge\r\nand tilted his head.  His hairy throat swelled until it seemed to grow\r\nnear his chin.  There was a tremendous gulping movement and the beer\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nThe man caught his breath and laughed.  He hit his son on the head with\r\nthe empty pail.  As it rolled clanging into the street, Jimmie began to\r\nscream and kicked repeatedly at his father\'s shins.\r\n\r\n"Look at deh dirt what yeh done me," he yelled.  "Deh ol\' woman \'ill be\r\nraisin\' hell."\r\n\r\nHe retreated to the middle of the street, but the man did not pursue.\r\nHe staggered toward the door.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll club hell outa yeh when I ketch yeh," he shouted, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening he had been standing against a bar drinking whiskies\r\nand declaring to all comers, confidentially: "My home reg\'lar livin\'\r\nhell!  Damndes\' place!  Reg\'lar hell!  Why do I come an\' drin\' whisk\'\r\nhere thish way?  \'Cause home reg\'lar livin\' hell!"\r\n\r\nJimmie waited a long time in the street and then crept warily up\r\nthrough the building.  He passed with great caution the door of the\r\ngnarled woman, and finally stopped outside his home and listened.\r\n\r\nHe could hear his mother moving heavily about among the furniture of\r\nthe room.  She was chanting in a mournful voice, occasionally\r\ninterjecting bursts of volcanic wrath at the father, who, Jimmie\r\njudged, had sunk down on the floor or in a corner.\r\n\r\n"Why deh blazes don\' chere try teh keep Jim from fightin\'?  I\'ll break\r\nher jaw," she suddenly bellowed.\r\n\r\nThe man mumbled with drunken indifference.  "Ah, wha\' deh hell.  W\'a\'s\r\nodds?  Wha\' makes kick?"\r\n\r\n"Because he tears \'is clothes, yeh damn fool," cried the woman in\r\nsupreme wrath.\r\n\r\nThe husband seemed to become aroused.  "Go teh hell," he thundered\r\nfiercely in reply.  There was a crash against the door and something\r\nbroke into clattering fragments.  Jimmie partially suppressed a howl\r\nand darted down the stairway.  Below he paused and listened.  He heard\r\nhowls and curses, groans and shrieks, confusingly in chorus as if a\r\nbattle were raging.  With all was the crash of splintering furniture.\r\nThe eyes of the urchin glared in fear that one of them would discover\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCurious faces appeared in doorways, and whispered comments passed to\r\nand fro.  "Ol\' Johnson\'s raisin\' hell agin."\r\n\r\nJimmie stood until the noises ceased and the other inhabitants of the\r\ntenement had all yawned and shut their doors.  Then he crawled upstairs\r\nwith the caution of an invader of a panther den.  Sounds of labored\r\nbreathing came through the broken door-panels.  He pushed the door open\r\nand entered, quaking.\r\n\r\nA glow from the fire threw red hues over the bare floor, the cracked\r\nand soiled plastering, and the overturned and broken furniture.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the floor lay his mother asleep.  In one corner of the\r\nroom his father\'s limp body hung across the seat of a chair.\r\n\r\nThe urchin stole forward.  He began to shiver in dread of awakening his\r\nparents.  His mother\'s great chest was heaving painfully.  Jimmie\r\npaused and looked down at her.  Her face was inflamed and swollen from\r\ndrinking.  Her yellow brows shaded eyelids that had brown blue.  Her\r\ntangled hair tossed in waves over her forehead.  Her mouth was set in\r\nthe same lines of vindictive hatred that it had, perhaps, borne during\r\nthe fight.  Her bare, red arms were thrown out above her head in\r\npositions of exhaustion, something, mayhap, like those of a sated\r\nvillain.\r\n\r\nThe urchin bended over his mother.  He was fearful lest she should open\r\nher eyes, and the dread within him was so strong, that he could not\r\nforbear to stare, but hung as if fascinated over the woman\'s grim face.\r\n\r\nSuddenly her eyes opened.  The urchin found himself looking straight\r\ninto that expression, which, it would seem, had the power to change his\r\nblood to salt.  He howled piercingly and fell backward.\r\n\r\nThe woman floundered for a moment, tossed her arms about her head as if\r\nin combat, and again began to snore.\r\n\r\nJimmie crawled back in the shadows and waited.  A noise in the next\r\nroom had followed his cry at the discovery that his mother was awake.\r\nHe grovelled in the gloom, the eyes from out his drawn face riveted\r\nupon the intervening door.\r\n\r\nHe heard it creak, and then the sound of a small voice came to him.\r\n"Jimmie!  Jimmie!  Are yehs dere?" it whispered.  The urchin started.\r\nThe thin, white face of his sister looked at him from the door-way of\r\nthe other room.  She crept to him across the floor.\r\n\r\nThe father had not moved, but lay in the same death-like sleep.  The\r\nmother writhed in uneasy slumber, her chest wheezing as if she were in\r\nthe agonies of strangulation.  Out at the window a florid moon was\r\npeering over dark roofs, and in the distance the waters of a river\r\nglimmered pallidly.\r\n\r\nThe small frame of the ragged girl was quivering.  Her features were\r\nhaggard from weeping, and her eyes gleamed from fear.  She grasped the\r\nurchin\'s arm in her little trembling hands and they huddled in a\r\ncorner.  The eyes of both were drawn, by some force, to stare at the\r\nwoman\'s face, for they thought she need only to awake and all fiends\r\nwould come from below.\r\n\r\nThey crouched until the ghost-mists of dawn appeared at the window,\r\ndrawing close to the panes, and looking in at the prostrate, heaving\r\nbody of the mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nThe babe, Tommie, died.  He went away in a white, insignificant coffin,\r\nhis small waxen hand clutching a flower that the girl, Maggie, had\r\nstolen from an Italian.\r\n\r\nShe and Jimmie lived.\r\n\r\nThe inexperienced fibres of the boy\'s eyes were hardened at an early\r\nage.  He became a young man of leather.  He lived some red years\r\nwithout laboring.  During that time his sneer became chronic.  He\r\nstudied human nature in the gutter, and found it no worse than he\r\nthought he had reason to believe it.  He never conceived a respect for\r\nthe world, because he had begun with no idols that it had smashed.\r\n\r\nHe clad his soul in armor by means of happening hilariously in at a\r\nmission church where a man composed his sermons of "yous." While they\r\ngot warm at the stove, he told his hearers just where he calculated\r\nthey stood with the Lord.  Many of the sinners were impatient over the\r\npictured depths of their degradation.  They were waiting for\r\nsoup-tickets.\r\n\r\nA reader of words of wind-demons might have been able to see the\r\nportions of a dialogue pass to and fro between the exhorter and his\r\nhearers.\r\n\r\n"You are damned," said the preacher.  And the reader of sounds might\r\nhave seen the reply go forth from the ragged people: "Where\'s our soup?"\r\n\r\nJimmie and a companion sat in a rear seat and commented upon the things\r\nthat didn\'t concern them, with all the freedom of English gentlemen.\r\nWhen they grew thirsty and went out their minds confused the speaker\r\nwith Christ.\r\n\r\nMomentarily, Jimmie was sullen with thoughts of a hopeless altitude\r\nwhere grew fruit.  His companion said that if he should ever meet God\r\nhe would ask for a million dollars and a bottle of beer.\r\n\r\nJimmie\'s occupation for a long time was to stand on streetcorners and\r\nwatch the world go by, dreaming blood-red dreams at the passing of\r\npretty women.  He menaced mankind at the intersections of streets.\r\n\r\nOn the corners he was in life and of life.  The world was going on and\r\nhe was there to perceive it.\r\n\r\nHe maintained a belligerent attitude toward all well-dressed men.  To\r\nhim fine raiment was allied to weakness, and all good coats covered\r\nfaint hearts.  He and his order were kings, to a certain extent, over\r\nthe men of untarnished clothes, because these latter dreaded, perhaps,\r\nto be either killed or laughed at.\r\n\r\nAbove all things he despised obvious Christians and ciphers with the\r\nchrysanthemums of aristocracy in their button-holes.  He considered\r\nhimself above both of these classes.  He was afraid of neither the\r\ndevil nor the leader of society.\r\n\r\nWhen he had a dollar in his pocket his satisfaction with existence was\r\nthe greatest thing in the world.  So, eventually, he felt obliged to\r\nwork.  His father died and his mother\'s years were divided up into\r\nperiods of thirty days.\r\n\r\nHe became a truck driver.  He was given the charge of a painstaking\r\npair of horses and a large rattling truck.  He invaded the turmoil and\r\ntumble of the down-town streets and learned to breathe maledictory\r\ndefiance at the police who occasionally used to climb up, drag him from\r\nhis perch and beat him.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the city he daily involved himself in hideous\r\ntangles.  If he and his team chanced to be in the rear he preserved a\r\ndemeanor of serenity, crossing his legs and bursting forth into yells\r\nwhen foot passengers took dangerous dives beneath the noses of his\r\nchamping horses.  He smoked his pipe calmly for he knew that his pay\r\nwas marching on.\r\n\r\nIf in the front and the key-truck of chaos, he entered terrifically\r\ninto the quarrel that was raging to and fro among the drivers on their\r\nhigh seats, and sometimes roared oaths and violently got himself\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nAfter a time his sneer grew so that it turned its glare upon all\r\nthings.  He became so sharp that he believed in nothing.  To him the\r\npolice were always actuated by malignant impulses and the rest of the\r\nworld was composed, for the most part, of despicable creatures who were\r\nall trying to take advantage of him and with whom, in defense, he was\r\nobliged to quarrel on all possible occasions.  He himself occupied a\r\ndown-trodden position that had a private but distinct element of\r\ngrandeur in its isolation.\r\n\r\nThe most complete cases of aggravated idiocy were, to his mind, rampant\r\nupon the front platforms of all the street cars.  At first his tongue\r\nstrove with these beings, but he eventually was superior.  He became\r\nimmured like an African cow.  In him grew a majestic contempt for those\r\nstrings of street cars that followed him like intent bugs.\r\n\r\nHe fell into the habit, when starting on a long journey, of fixing his\r\neye on a high and distant object, commanding his horses to begin, and\r\nthen going into a sort of a trance of observation.  Multitudes of\r\ndrivers might howl in his rear, and passengers might load him with\r\nopprobrium, he would not awaken until some blue policeman turned red\r\nand began to frenziedly tear bridles and beat the soft noses of the\r\nresponsible horses.\r\n\r\nWhen he paused to contemplate the attitude of the police toward himself\r\nand his fellows, he believed that they were the only men in the city\r\nwho had no rights.  When driving about, he felt that he was held liable\r\nby the police for anything that might occur in the streets, and was the\r\ncommon prey of all energetic officials.  In revenge, he resolved never\r\nto move out of the way of anything, until formidable circumstances, or\r\na much larger man than himself forced him to it.\r\n\r\nFoot-passengers were mere pestering flies with an insane disregard for\r\ntheir legs and his convenience.  He could not conceive their maniacal\r\ndesires to cross the streets.  Their madness smote him with eternal\r\namazement.  He was continually storming at them from his throne.  He\r\nsat aloft and denounced their frantic leaps, plunges, dives and\r\nstraddles.\r\n\r\nWhen they would thrust at, or parry, the noses of his champing horses,\r\nmaking them swing their heads and move their feet, disturbing a solid\r\ndreamy repose, he swore at the men as fools, for he himself could\r\nperceive that Providence had caused it clearly to be written, that he\r\nand his team had the unalienable right to stand in the proper path of\r\nthe sun chariot, and if they so minded, obstruct its mission or take a\r\nwheel off.\r\n\r\nAnd, perhaps, if the god-driver had an ungovernable desire to step\r\ndown, put up his flame-colored fists and manfully dispute the right of\r\nway, he would have probably been immediately opposed by a scowling\r\nmortal with two sets of very hard knuckles.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, perhaps, that this young man would have derided, in an\r\naxle-wide alley, the approach of a flying ferry boat.  Yet he achieved\r\na respect for a fire engine.  As one charged toward his truck, he would\r\ndrive fearfully upon a sidewalk, threatening untold people with\r\nannihilation.  When an engine would strike a mass of blocked trucks,\r\nsplitting it into fragments, as a blow annihilates a cake of ice,\r\nJimmie\'s team could usually be observed high and safe, with whole\r\nwheels, on the sidewalk.  The fearful coming of the engine could break\r\nup the most intricate muddle of heavy vehicles at which the police had\r\nbeen swearing for the half of an hour.\r\n\r\nA fire engine was enshrined in his heart as an appalling thing that he\r\nloved with a distant dog-like devotion.  They had been known to\r\noverturn street-cars.  Those leaping horses, striking sparks from the\r\ncobbles in their forward lunge, were creatures to be ineffably admired.\r\nThe clang of the gong pierced his breast like a noise of remembered war.\r\n\r\nWhen Jimmie was a little boy, he began to be arrested.  Before he\r\nreached a great age, he had a fair record.\r\n\r\nHe developed too great a tendency to climb down from his truck and\r\nfight with other drivers.  He had been in quite a number of\r\nmiscellaneous fights, and in some general barroom rows that had become\r\nknown to the police.  Once he had been arrested for assaulting a\r\nChinaman.  Two women in different parts of the city, and entirely\r\nunknown to each other, caused him considerable annoyance by breaking\r\nforth, simultaneously, at fateful intervals, into wailings about\r\nmarriage and support and infants.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he had, on a certain star-lit evening, said wonderingly\r\nand quite reverently: "Deh moon looks like hell, don\'t it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nThe girl, Maggie, blossomed in a mud puddle.  She grew to be a most\r\nrare and wonderful production of a tenement district, a pretty girl.\r\n\r\nNone of the dirt of Rum Alley seemed to be in her veins.  The\r\nphilosophers up-stairs, down-stairs and on the same floor, puzzled over\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen a child, playing and fighting with gamins in the street, dirt\r\ndisguised her.  Attired in tatters and grime, she went unseen.\r\n\r\nThere came a time, however, when the young men of the vicinity said:\r\n"Dat Johnson goil is a puty good looker."  About this period her\r\nbrother remarked to her: "Mag, I\'ll tell yeh dis!  See?  Yeh\'ve edder\r\ngot teh go teh hell or go teh work!"  Whereupon she went to work,\r\nhaving the feminine aversion of going to hell.\r\n\r\nBy a chance, she got a position in an establishment where they made\r\ncollars and cuffs.  She received a stool and a machine in a room where\r\nsat twenty girls of various shades of yellow discontent.  She perched\r\non the stool and treadled at her machine all day, turning out collars,\r\nthe name of whose brand could be noted for its irrelevancy to anything\r\nin connection with collars.  At night she returned home to her mother.\r\n\r\nJimmie grew large enough to take the vague position of head of the\r\nfamily.  As incumbent of that office, he stumbled up-stairs late at\r\nnight, as his father had done before him.  He reeled about the room,\r\nswearing at his relations, or went to sleep on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe mother had gradually arisen to that degree of fame that she could\r\nbandy words with her acquaintances among the police-justices.\r\nCourt-officials called her by her first name.  When she appeared they\r\npursued a course which had been theirs for months.  They invariably\r\ngrinned and cried out: "Hello, Mary, you here again?"  Her grey head\r\nwagged in many a court.  She always besieged the bench with voluble\r\nexcuses, explanations, apologies and prayers.  Her flaming face and\r\nrolling eyes were a sort of familiar sight on the island.  She measured\r\ntime by means of sprees, and was eternally swollen and dishevelled.\r\n\r\nOne day the young man, Pete, who as a lad had smitten the Devil\'s Row\r\nurchin in the back of the head and put to flight the antagonists of his\r\nfriend, Jimmie, strutted upon the scene.  He met Jimmie one day on the\r\nstreet, promised to take him to a boxing match in Williamsburg, and\r\ncalled for him in the evening.\r\n\r\nMaggie observed Pete.\r\n\r\nHe sat on a table in the Johnson home and dangled his checked legs with\r\nan enticing nonchalance.  His hair was curled down over his forehead in\r\nan oiled bang.  His rather pugged nose seemed to revolt from contact\r\nwith a bristling moustache of short, wire-like hairs.  His blue\r\ndouble-breasted coat, edged with black braid, buttoned close to a red\r\npuff tie, and his patent-leather shoes looked like murder-fitted\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nHis mannerisms stamped him as a man who had a correct sense of his\r\npersonal superiority.  There was valor and contempt for circumstances\r\nin the glance of his eye.  He waved his hands like a man of the world,\r\nwho dismisses religion and philosophy, and says "Fudge."  He had\r\ncertainly seen everything and with each curl of his lip, he declared\r\nthat it amounted to nothing.  Maggie thought he must be a very elegant\r\nand graceful bartender.\r\n\r\nHe was telling tales to Jimmie.\r\n\r\nMaggie watched him furtively, with half-closed eyes, lit with a vague\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"Hully gee!  Dey makes me tired," he said.  "Mos\' e\'ry day some farmer\r\ncomes in an\' tries teh run deh shop.  See?  But dey gits t\'rowed right\r\nout!  I jolt dem right out in deh street before dey knows where dey is!\r\nSee?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Dere was a mug come in deh place deh odder day wid an idear he wus\r\ngoin\' teh own deh place!  Hully gee, he wus goin\' teh own deh place!  I\r\nsee he had a still on an\' I didn\' wanna giv \'im no stuff, so I says:\r\n\'Git deh hell outa here an\' don\' make no trouble,\' I says like dat!\r\nSee?  \'Git deh hell outa here an\' don\' make no trouble\'; like dat.\r\n\'Git deh hell outa here,\' I says.  See?"\r\n\r\nJimmie nodded understandingly.  Over his features played an eager\r\ndesire to state the amount of his valor in a similar crisis, but the\r\nnarrator proceeded.\r\n\r\n"Well, deh blokie he says: \'T\'hell wid it!  I ain\' lookin\' for no\r\nscrap,\' he says (See?), \'but\' he says, \'I\'m \'spectable cit\'zen an\' I\r\nwanna drink an\' purtydamnsoon, too.\'  See?  \'Deh hell,\' I says.  Like\r\ndat!  \'Deh hell,\' I says.  See?  \'Don\' make no trouble,\' I says.  Like\r\ndat.  \'Don\' make no trouble.\'  See?  Den deh mug he squared off an\'\r\nsaid he was fine as silk wid his dukes (See?) an\' he wanned a drink\r\ndamnquick.  Dat\'s what he said.  See?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," repeated Jimmie.\r\n\r\nPete continued.  "Say, I jes\' jumped deh bar an\' deh way I plunked dat\r\nblokie was great.  See?  Dat\'s right!  In deh jaw!  See?  Hully gee, he\r\nt\'rowed a spittoon true deh front windee.  Say, I taut I\'d drop dead.\r\nBut deh boss, he comes in after an\' he says, \'Pete, yehs done jes\'\r\nright!  Yeh\'ve gota keep order an\' it\'s all right.\'  See?  \'It\'s all\r\nright,\' he says.  Dat\'s what he said."\r\n\r\nThe two held a technical discussion.\r\n\r\n"Dat bloke was a dandy," said Pete, in conclusion, "but he hadn\' oughta\r\nmade no trouble.  Dat\'s what I says teh dem: \'Don\' come in here an\'\r\nmake no trouble,\' I says, like dat.  \'Don\' make no trouble.\'  See?"\r\n\r\nAs Jimmie and his friend exchanged tales descriptive of their prowess,\r\nMaggie leaned back in the shadow.  Her eyes dwelt wonderingly and\r\nrather wistfully upon Pete\'s face.  The broken furniture, grimey walls,\r\nand general disorder and dirt of her home of a sudden appeared before\r\nher and began to take a potential aspect.  Pete\'s aristocratic person\r\nlooked as if it might soil.  She looked keenly at him, occasionally,\r\nwondering if he was feeling contempt.  But Pete seemed to be enveloped\r\nin reminiscence.\r\n\r\n"Hully gee," said he, "dose mugs can\'t phase me.  Dey knows I kin wipe\r\nup deh street wid any t\'ree of dem."\r\n\r\nWhen he said, "Ah, what deh hell," his voice was burdened with disdain\r\nfor the inevitable and contempt for anything that fate might compel him\r\nto endure.\r\n\r\nMaggie perceived that here was the beau ideal of a man.  Her dim\r\nthoughts were often searching for far away lands where, as God says,\r\nthe little hills sing together in the morning.  Under the trees of her\r\ndream-gardens there had always walked a lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nPete took note of Maggie.\r\n\r\n"Say, Mag, I\'m stuck on yer shape.  It\'s outa sight," he said,\r\nparenthetically, with an affable grin.\r\n\r\nAs he became aware that she was listening closely, he grew still more\r\neloquent in his descriptions of various happenings in his career.  It\r\nappeared that he was invincible in fights.\r\n\r\n"Why," he said, referring to a man with whom he had had a\r\nmisunderstanding, "dat mug scrapped like a damn dago.  Dat\'s right.  He\r\nwas dead easy.  See?  He tau\'t he was a scrapper.  But he foun\' out\r\ndiff\'ent!  Hully gee."\r\n\r\nHe walked to and fro in the small room, which seemed then to grow even\r\nsmaller and unfit to hold his dignity, the attribute of a supreme\r\nwarrior.  That swing of the shoulders that had frozen the timid when he\r\nwas but a lad had increased with his growth and education at the ratio\r\nof ten to one.  It, combined with the sneer upon his mouth, told\r\nmankind that there was nothing in space which could appall him.  Maggie\r\nmarvelled at him and surrounded him with greatness.  She vaguely tried\r\nto calculate the altitude of the pinnacle from which he must have\r\nlooked down upon her.\r\n\r\n"I met a chump deh odder day way up in deh city," he said.  "I was\r\ngoin\' teh see a frien\' of mine.  When I was a-crossin\' deh street deh\r\nchump runned plump inteh me, an\' den he turns aroun\' an\' says, \'Yer\r\ninsolen\' ruffin,\' he says, like dat.  \'Oh, gee,\' I says, \'oh, gee, go\r\nteh hell and git off deh eart\',\' I says, like dat.  See?  \'Go teh hell\r\nan\' git off deh eart\',\' like dat.  Den deh blokie he got wild.  He says\r\nI was a contempt\'ble scoun\'el, er somet\'ing like dat, an\' he says I was\r\ndoom\' teh everlastin\' pe\'dition an\' all like dat.  \'Gee,\' I says, \'gee!\r\nDeh hell I am,\' I says.  \'Deh hell I am,\' like dat.  An\' den I slugged\r\n\'im.  See?"\r\n\r\nWith Jimmie in his company, Pete departed in a sort of a blaze of glory\r\nfrom the Johnson home.  Maggie, leaning from the window, watched him as\r\nhe walked down the street.\r\n\r\nHere was a formidable man who disdained the strength of a world full of\r\nfists.  Here was one who had contempt for brass-clothed power; one\r\nwhose knuckles could defiantly ring against the granite of law.  He was\r\na knight.\r\n\r\nThe two men went from under the glimmering street-lamp and passed into\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nTurning, Maggie contemplated the dark, dust-stained walls, and the\r\nscant and crude furniture of her home.  A clock, in a splintered and\r\nbattered oblong box of varnished wood, she suddenly regarded as an\r\nabomination.  She noted that it ticked raspingly.  The almost vanished\r\nflowers in the carpet-pattern, she conceived to be newly hideous.  Some\r\nfaint attempts she had made with blue ribbon, to freshen the appearance\r\nof a dingy curtain, she now saw to be piteous.\r\n\r\nShe wondered what Pete dined on.\r\n\r\nShe reflected upon the collar and cuff factory.  It began to appear to\r\nher mind as a dreary place of endless grinding.  Pete\'s elegant\r\noccupation brought him, no doubt, into contact with people who had\r\nmoney and manners.  It was probable that he had a large acquaintance of\r\npretty girls.  He must have great sums of money to spend.\r\n\r\nTo her the earth was composed of hardships and insults.  She felt\r\ninstant admiration for a man who openly defied it.  She thought that if\r\nthe grim angel of death should clutch his heart, Pete would shrug his\r\nshoulders and say: "Oh, ev\'ryt\'ing goes."\r\n\r\nShe anticipated that he would come again shortly.  She spent some of\r\nher week\'s pay in the purchase of flowered cretonne for a lambrequin.\r\nShe made it with infinite care and hung it to the slightly-careening\r\nmantel, over the stove, in the kitchen.  She studied it with painful\r\nanxiety from different points in the room.  She wanted it to look well\r\non Sunday night when, perhaps, Jimmie\'s friend would come.  On Sunday\r\nnight, however, Pete did not appear.\r\n\r\nAfterward the girl looked at it with a sense of humiliation.  She was\r\nnow convinced that Pete was superior to admiration for lambrequins.\r\n\r\nA few evenings later Pete entered with fascinating innovations in his\r\napparel.  As she had seen him twice and he had different suits on each\r\ntime, Maggie had a dim impression that his wardrobe was prodigiously\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\n"Say, Mag," he said, "put on yer bes\' duds Friday night an\' I\'ll take\r\nyehs teh deh show.  See?"\r\n\r\nHe spent a few moments in flourishing his clothes and then vanished,\r\nwithout having glanced at the lambrequin.\r\n\r\nOver the eternal collars and cuffs in the factory Maggie spent the most\r\nof three days in making imaginary sketches of Pete and his daily\r\nenvironment.  She imagined some half dozen women in love with him and\r\nthought he must lean dangerously toward an indefinite one, whom she\r\npictured with great charms of person, but with an altogether\r\ncontemptible disposition.\r\n\r\nShe thought he must live in a blare of pleasure.  He had friends, and\r\npeople who were afraid of him.\r\n\r\nShe saw the golden glitter of the place where Pete was to take her.  An\r\nentertainment of many hues and many melodies where she was afraid she\r\nmight appear small and mouse-colored.\r\n\r\nHer mother drank whiskey all Friday morning.  With lurid face and\r\ntossing hair she cursed and destroyed furniture all Friday afternoon.\r\nWhen Maggie came home at half-past six her mother lay asleep amidst the\r\nwreck of chairs and a table.  Fragments of various household utensils\r\nwere scattered about the floor.  She had vented some phase of drunken\r\nfury upon the lambrequin.  It lay in a bedraggled heap in the corner.\r\n\r\n"Hah," she snorted, sitting up suddenly, "where deh hell yeh been?  Why\r\ndeh hell don\' yeh come home earlier?  Been loafin\' \'round deh streets.\r\nYer gettin\' teh be a reg\'lar devil."\r\n\r\nWhen Pete arrived Maggie, in a worn black dress, was waiting for him in\r\nthe midst of a floor strewn with wreckage.  The curtain at the window\r\nhad been pulled by a heavy hand and hung by one tack, dangling to and\r\nfro in the draft through the cracks at the sash.  The knots of blue\r\nribbons appeared like violated flowers.  The fire in the stove had gone\r\nout.  The displaced lids and open doors showed heaps of sullen grey\r\nashes.  The remnants of a meal, ghastly, like dead flesh, lay in a\r\ncorner.  Maggie\'s red mother, stretched on the floor, blasphemed and\r\ngave her daughter a bad name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nAn orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men on an elevated\r\nstage near the centre of a great green-hued hall, played a popular\r\nwaltz.  The place was crowded with people grouped about little tables.\r\nA battalion of waiters slid among the throng, carrying trays of beer\r\nglasses and making change from the inexhaustible vaults of their\r\ntrousers pockets.  Little boys, in the costumes of French chefs,\r\nparaded up and down the irregular aisles vending fancy cakes.  There\r\nwas a low rumble of conversation and a subdued clinking of glasses.\r\nClouds of tobacco smoke rolled and wavered high in air about the dull\r\ngilt of the chandeliers.\r\n\r\nThe vast crowd had an air throughout of having just quitted labor.  Men\r\nwith calloused hands and attired in garments that showed the wear of an\r\nendless trudge for a living, smoked their pipes contentedly and spent\r\nfive, ten, or perhaps fifteen cents for beer.  There was a mere\r\nsprinkling of kid-gloved men who smoked cigars purchased elsewhere.\r\nThe great body of the crowd was composed of people who showed that all\r\nday they strove with their hands.  Quiet Germans, with maybe their\r\nwives and two or three children, sat listening to the music, with the\r\nexpressions of happy cows.  An occasional party of sailors from a\r\nwar-ship, their faces pictures of sturdy health, spent the earlier\r\nhours of the evening at the small round tables.  Very infrequent tipsy\r\nmen, swollen with the value of their opinions, engaged their companions\r\nin earnest and confidential conversation.  In the balcony, and here and\r\nthere below, shone the impassive faces of women.  The nationalities of\r\nthe Bowery beamed upon the stage from all directions.\r\n\r\nPete aggressively walked up a side aisle and took seats with Maggie at\r\na table beneath the balcony.\r\n\r\n"Two beehs!"\r\n\r\nLeaning back he regarded with eyes of superiority the scene before\r\nthem.  This attitude affected Maggie strongly.  A man who could regard\r\nsuch a sight with indifference must be accustomed to very great things.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that Pete had been to this place many times before, and\r\nwas very familiar with it.  A knowledge of this fact made Maggie feel\r\nlittle and new.\r\n\r\nHe was extremely gracious and attentive.  He displayed the\r\nconsideration of a cultured gentleman who knew what was due.\r\n\r\n"Say, what deh hell?  Bring deh lady a big glass!  What deh hell use is\r\ndat pony?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be fresh, now," said the waiter, with some warmth, as he\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n"Ah, git off deh eart\'," said Pete, after the other\'s retreating form.\r\n\r\nMaggie perceived that Pete brought forth all his elegance and all his\r\nknowledge of high-class customs for her benefit.  Her heart warmed as\r\nshe reflected upon his condescension.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men gave vent to a\r\nfew bars of anticipatory music and a girl, in a pink dress with short\r\nskirts, galloped upon the stage.  She smiled upon the throng as if in\r\nacknowledgment of a warm welcome, and began to walk to and fro, making\r\nprofuse gesticulations and singing, in brazen soprano tones, a song,\r\nthe words of which were inaudible.  When she broke into the swift\r\nrattling measures of a chorus some half-tipsy men near the stage joined\r\nin the rollicking refrain and glasses were pounded rhythmically upon\r\nthe tables.  People leaned forward to watch her and to try to catch the\r\nwords of the song.  When she vanished there were long rollings of\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nObedient to more anticipatory bars, she reappeared amidst the\r\nhalf-suppressed cheering of the tipsy men.  The orchestra plunged into\r\ndance music and the laces of the dancer fluttered and flew in the glare\r\nof gas jets.  She divulged the fact that she was attired in some half\r\ndozen skirts.  It was patent that any one of them would have proved\r\nadequate for the purpose for which skirts are intended.  An occasional\r\nman bent forward, intent upon the pink stockings.  Maggie wondered at\r\nthe splendor of the costume and lost herself in calculations of the\r\ncost of the silks and laces.\r\n\r\nThe dancer\'s smile of stereotyped enthusiasm was turned for ten minutes\r\nupon the faces of her audience.  In the finale she fell into some of\r\nthose grotesque attitudes which were at the time popular among the\r\ndancers in the theatres up-town, giving to the Bowery public the\r\nphantasies of the aristocratic theatre-going public, at reduced rates.\r\n\r\n"Say, Pete," said Maggie, leaning forward, "dis is great."\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Pete, with proper complacence.\r\n\r\nA ventriloquist followed the dancer.  He held two fantastic dolls on\r\nhis knees.  He made them sing mournful ditties and say funny things\r\nabout geography and Ireland.\r\n\r\n"Do dose little men talk?" asked Maggie.\r\n\r\n"Naw," said Pete, "it\'s some damn fake.  See?"\r\n\r\nTwo girls, on the bills as sisters, came forth and sang a duet that is\r\nheard occasionally at concerts given under church auspices.  They\r\nsupplemented it with a dance which of course can never be seen at\r\nconcerts given under church auspices.\r\n\r\nAfter the duettists had retired, a woman of debatable age sang a negro\r\nmelody.  The chorus necessitated some grotesque waddlings supposed to\r\nbe an imitation of a plantation darkey, under the influence, probably,\r\nof music and the moon.  The audience was just enthusiastic enough over\r\nit to have her return and sing a sorrowful lay, whose lines told of a\r\nmother\'s love and a sweetheart who waited and a young man who was lost\r\nat sea under the most harrowing circumstances.  From the faces of a\r\nscore or so in the crowd, the self-contained look faded.  Many heads\r\nwere bent forward with eagerness and sympathy.  As the last distressing\r\nsentiment of the piece was brought forth, it was greeted by that kind\r\nof applause which rings as sincere.\r\n\r\nAs a final effort, the singer rendered some verses which described a\r\nvision of Britain being annihilated by America, and Ireland bursting\r\nher bonds.  A carefully prepared crisis was reached in the last line of\r\nthe last verse, where the singer threw out her arms and cried, "The\r\nstar-spangled banner."  Instantly a great cheer swelled from the\r\nthroats of the assemblage of the masses.  There was a heavy rumble of\r\nbooted feet thumping the floor.  Eyes gleamed with sudden fire, and\r\ncalloused hands waved frantically in the air.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments\' rest, the orchestra played crashingly, and a small\r\nfat man burst out upon the stage.  He began to roar a song and stamp\r\nback and forth before the foot-lights, wildly waving a glossy silk hat\r\nand throwing leers, or smiles, broadcast.  He made his face into\r\nfantastic grimaces until he looked like a pictured devil on a Japanese\r\nkite.  The crowd laughed gleefully.  His short, fat legs were never\r\nstill a moment.  He shouted and roared and bobbed his shock of red wig\r\nuntil the audience broke out in excited applause.\r\n\r\nPete did not pay much attention to the progress of events upon the\r\nstage.  He was drinking beer and watching Maggie.\r\n\r\nHer cheeks were blushing with excitement and her eyes were glistening.\r\nShe drew deep breaths of pleasure.  No thoughts of the atmosphere of\r\nthe collar and cuff factory came to her.\r\n\r\nWhen the orchestra crashed finally, they jostled their way to the\r\nsidewalk with the crowd.  Pete took Maggie\'s arm and pushed a way for\r\nher, offering to fight with a man or two.\r\n\r\nThey reached Maggie\'s home at a late hour and stood for a moment in\r\nfront of the gruesome doorway.\r\n\r\n"Say, Mag," said Pete, "give us a kiss for takin\' yeh teh deh show,\r\nwill yer?"\r\n\r\nMaggie laughed, as if startled, and drew away from him.\r\n\r\n"Naw, Pete," she said, "dat wasn\'t in it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what deh hell?" urged Pete.\r\n\r\nThe girl retreated nervously.\r\n\r\n"Ah, what deh hell?" repeated he.\r\n\r\nMaggie darted into the hall, and up the stairs.  She turned and smiled\r\nat him, then disappeared.\r\n\r\nPete walked slowly down the street.  He had something of an astonished\r\nexpression upon his features.  He paused under a lamp-post and breathed\r\na low breath of surprise.\r\n\r\n"Gawd," he said, "I wonner if I\'ve been played fer a duffer."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nAs thoughts of Pete came to Maggie\'s mind, she began to have an intense\r\ndislike for all of her dresses.\r\n\r\n"What deh hell ails yeh?  What makes yeh be allus fixin\' and fussin\'?\r\nGood Gawd," her mother would frequently roar at her.\r\n\r\nShe began to note, with more interest, the well-dressed women she met\r\non the avenues.  She envied elegance and soft palms.  She craved those\r\nadornments of person which she saw every day on the street, conceiving\r\nthem to be allies of vast importance to women.\r\n\r\nStudying faces, she thought many of the women and girls she chanced to\r\nmeet, smiled with serenity as though forever cherished and watched over\r\nby those they loved.\r\n\r\nThe air in the collar and cuff establishment strangled her.  She knew\r\nshe was gradually and surely shrivelling in the hot, stuffy room.  The\r\nbegrimed windows rattled incessantly from the passing of elevated\r\ntrains.  The place was filled with a whirl of noises and odors.\r\n\r\nShe wondered as she regarded some of the grizzled women in the room,\r\nmere mechanical contrivances sewing seams and grinding out, with heads\r\nbended over their work, tales of imagined or real girlhood happiness,\r\npast drunks, the baby at home, and unpaid wages.  She speculated how\r\nlong her youth would endure.  She began to see the bloom upon her\r\ncheeks as valuable.\r\n\r\nShe imagined herself, in an exasperating future, as a scrawny woman\r\nwith an eternal grievance.  Too, she thought Pete to be a very\r\nfastidious person concerning the appearance of women.\r\n\r\nShe felt she would love to see somebody entangle their fingers in the\r\noily beard of the fat foreigner who owned the establishment.  He was a\r\ndetestable creature.  He wore white socks with low shoes.\r\n\r\nHe sat all day delivering orations, in the depths of a cushioned chair.\r\nHis pocketbook deprived them of the power to retort.\r\n\r\n"What een hell do you sink I pie fife dolla a week for? Play? No, py\r\ndamn!" Maggie was anxious for a friend to whom she could talk about\r\nPete. She would have liked to discuss his admirable mannerisms with a\r\nreliable mutual friend. At home, she found her mother often drunk and\r\nalways raving. It seems that the world had treated this woman very\r\nbadly, and she took a deep revenge upon such portions of it as came\r\nwithin her reach. She broke furniture as if she were at last getting her\r\nrights. She swelled with virtuous indignation as she carried the lighter\r\narticles of household use, one by one under the shadows of the three\r\ngilt balls, where Hebrews chained them with chains of interest.\r\n\r\nJimmie came when he was obliged to by circumstances over which he had no\r\ncontrol. His well-trained legs brought him staggering home and put him\r\nto bed some nights when he would rather have gone elsewhere. Swaggering\r\nPete loomed like a golden sun to Maggie. He took her to a dime museum\r\nwhere rows of meek freaks astonished her. She contemplated their\r\ndeformities with awe and thought them a sort of chosen tribe.\r\n\r\n"What een hell do you sink I pie fife dolla a week for? Play? No, py\r\ndamn!"

He took her to a dime museum\r\nwhere rows of meek freaks astonished her. She contemplated their\r\ndeformities with awe and thought them a sort of chosen tribe.\r\n\r\nPete, raking his brains for amusement, discovered the Central Park\r\nMenagerie and the Museum of Arts. Sunday afternoons would sometimes find\r\nthem at these places. Pete did not appear to be particularly interested\r\nin what he saw. He stood around looking heavy, while Maggie giggled in\r\nglee.\r\n\r\nOnce at the Menagerie he went into a trance of admiration before the\r\nspectacle of a very small monkey threatening to thrash a cageful because\r\none of them had pulled his tail and he had not wheeled about quickly\r\nenough to discover who did it. Ever after Pete knew that monkey by sight\r\nand winked at him, trying to induce hime to fight with other and larger\r\nmonkeys. At the Museum, Maggie said, "Dis is outa sight."\r\n\r\n"Oh hell," said Pete, "wait \'till next summer an\' I\'ll take yehs to a\r\npicnic."\r\n\r\nWhile the girl wandered in the vaulted rooms, Pete occupied himself in\r\nreturning stony stare for stony stare, the appalling scrutiny of the\r\nwatch-dogs of the treasures. Occasionally he would remark in loud tones:\r\n"Dat jay has got glass eyes," and sentences of the sort. When he tired\r\nof this amusement he would go to the mummies and moralize over them.\r\n\r\nUsually he submitted with silent dignity to all which he had to go\r\nthrough, but, at times, he was goaded into comment.\r\n\r\n"What deh hell," he demanded once.  "Look at all dese little jugs!\r\nHundred jugs in a row!  Ten rows in a case an\' \'bout a t\'ousand cases!\r\nWhat deh blazes use is dem?"\r\n\r\nEvenings during the week he took her to see plays in which the\r\nbrain-clutching heroine was rescued from the palatial home of her\r\nguardian, who is cruelly after her bonds, by the hero with the\r\nbeautiful sentiments.  The latter spent most of his time out at soak in\r\npale-green snow storms, busy with a nickel-plated revolver, rescuing\r\naged strangers from villains.\r\n\r\nMaggie lost herself in sympathy with the wanderers swooning in snow\r\nstorms beneath happy-hued church windows.  And a choir within singing\r\n"Joy to the World."  To Maggie and the rest of the audience this was\r\ntranscendental realism.  Joy always within, and they, like the actor,\r\ninevitably without.  Viewing it, they hugged themselves in ecstatic\r\npity of their imagined or real condition.\r\n\r\nThe girl thought the arrogance and granite-heartedness of the magnate\r\nof the play was very accurately drawn.  She echoed the maledictions\r\nthat the occupants of the gallery showered on this individual when his\r\nlines compelled him to expose his extreme selfishness.\r\n\r\nShady persons in the audience revolted from the pictured villainy of\r\nthe drama.  With untiring zeal they hissed vice and applauded virtue.\r\nUnmistakably bad men evinced an apparently sincere admiration for\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nThe loud gallery was overwhelmingly with the unfortunate and the\r\noppressed.  They encouraged the struggling hero with cries, and jeered\r\nthe villain, hooting and calling attention to his whiskers.  When\r\nanybody died in the pale-green snow storms, the gallery mourned.  They\r\nsought out the painted misery and hugged it as akin.\r\n\r\nIn the hero\'s erratic march from poverty in the first act, to wealth\r\nand triumph in the final one, in which he forgives all the enemies that\r\nhe has left, he was assisted by the gallery, which applauded his\r\ngenerous and noble sentiments and confounded the speeches of his\r\nopponents by making irrelevant but very sharp remarks.  Those actors\r\nwho were cursed with villainy parts were confronted at every turn by\r\nthe gallery.  If one of them rendered lines containing the most subtile\r\ndistinctions between right and wrong, the gallery was immediately aware\r\nif the actor meant wickedness, and denounced him accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe last act was a triumph for the hero, poor and of the masses, the\r\nrepresentative of the audience, over the villain and the rich man, his\r\npockets stuffed with bonds, his heart packed with tyrannical purposes,\r\nimperturbable amid suffering.\r\n\r\nMaggie always departed with raised spirits from the showing places of\r\nthe melodrama.  She rejoiced at the way in which the poor and virtuous\r\neventually surmounted the wealthy and wicked.  The theatre made her\r\nthink.  She wondered if the culture and refinement she had seen\r\nimitated, perhaps grotesquely, by the heroine on the stage, could be\r\nacquired by a girl who lived in a tenement house and worked in a shirt\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nA group of urchins were intent upon the side door of a saloon.\r\nExpectancy gleamed from their eyes.  They were twisting their fingers\r\nin excitement.\r\n\r\n"Here she comes," yelled one of them suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe group of urchins burst instantly asunder and its individual\r\nfragments were spread in a wide, respectable half circle about the\r\npoint of interest.  The saloon door opened with a crash, and the figure\r\nof a woman appeared upon the threshold.  Her grey hair fell in knotted\r\nmasses about her shoulders.  Her face was crimsoned and wet with\r\nperspiration.  Her eyes had a rolling glare.\r\n\r\n"Not a damn cent more of me money will yehs ever get, not a damn cent.\r\nI spent me money here fer t\'ree years an\' now yehs tells me yeh\'ll sell\r\nme no more stuff!  T\'hell wid yeh, Johnnie Murckre!  \'Disturbance\'?\r\nDisturbance be damned!  T\'hell wid yeh, Johnnie--"\r\n\r\nThe door received a kick of exasperation from within and the woman\r\nlurched heavily out on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nThe gamins in the half-circle became violently agitated.  They began to\r\ndance about and hoot and yell and jeer.  Wide dirty grins spread over\r\neach face.\r\n\r\nThe woman made a furious dash at a particularly outrageous cluster of\r\nlittle boys.  They laughed delightedly and scampered off a short\r\ndistance, calling out over their shoulders to her.  She stood tottering\r\non the curb-stone and thundered at them.\r\n\r\n"Yeh devil\'s kids," she howled, shaking red fists.  The little boys\r\nwhooped in glee.  As she started up the street they fell in behind and\r\nmarched uproariously.  Occasionally she wheeled about and made charges\r\non them.  They ran nimbly out of reach and taunted her.\r\n\r\nIn the frame of a gruesome doorway she stood for a moment cursing them.\r\nHer hair straggled, giving her crimson features a look of insanity.\r\nHer great fists quivered as she shook them madly in the air.\r\n\r\nThe urchins made terrific noises until she turned and disappeared.\r\nThen they filed quietly in the way they had come.\r\n\r\nThe woman floundered about in the lower hall of the tenement house and\r\nfinally stumbled up the stairs.  On an upper hall a door was opened and\r\na collection of heads peered curiously out, watching her.  With a\r\nwrathful snort the woman confronted the door, but it was slammed\r\nhastily in her face and the key was turned.\r\n\r\nShe stood for a few minutes, delivering a frenzied challenge at the\r\npanels.\r\n\r\n"Come out in deh hall, Mary Murphy, damn yeh, if yehs want a row.  Come\r\nahn, yeh overgrown terrier, come ahn."\r\n\r\nShe began to kick the door with her great feet.  She shrilly defied the\r\nuniverse to appear and do battle.  Her cursing trebles brought heads\r\nfrom all doors save the one she threatened.  Her eyes glared in every\r\ndirection.  The air was full of her tossing fists.\r\n\r\n"Come ahn, deh hull damn gang of yehs, come ahn," she roared at the\r\nspectators.  An oath or two, cat-calls, jeers and bits of facetious\r\nadvice were given in reply.  Missiles clattered about her feet.\r\n\r\n"What deh hell\'s deh matter wid yeh?" said a voice in the gathered\r\ngloom, and Jimmie came forward.  He carried a tin dinner-pail in his\r\nhand and under his arm a brown truckman\'s apron done in a bundle.\r\n"What deh hell\'s wrong?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Come out, all of yehs, come out," his mother was howling.  "Come ahn\r\nan\' I\'ll stamp her damn brains under me feet."\r\n\r\n"Shet yer face, an\' come home, yeh damned old fool," roared Jimmie at\r\nher.  She strided up to him and twirled her fingers in his face.  Her\r\neyes were darting flames of unreasoning rage and her frame trembled\r\nwith eagerness for a fight.\r\n\r\n"T\'hell wid yehs!  An\' who deh hell are yehs?  I ain\'t givin\' a snap of\r\nme fingers fer yehs," she bawled at him.  She turned her huge back in\r\ntremendous disdain and climbed the stairs to the next floor.\r\n\r\nJimmie followed, cursing blackly.  At the top of the flight he seized\r\nhis mother\'s arm and started to drag her toward the door of their room.\r\n\r\n"Come home, damn yeh," he gritted between his teeth.\r\n\r\n"Take yer hands off me!  Take yer hands off me," shrieked his mother.\r\n\r\nShe raised her arm and whirled her great fist at her son\'s face.\r\nJimmie dodged his head and the blow struck him in the back of the neck.\r\n"Damn yeh," gritted he again.  He threw out his left hand and writhed\r\nhis fingers about her middle arm.  The mother and the son began to sway\r\nand struggle like gladiators.\r\n\r\n"Whoop!" said the Rum Alley tenement house.  The hall filled with\r\ninterested spectators.\r\n\r\n"Hi, ol\' lady, dat was a dandy!"\r\n\r\n"T\'ree to one on deh red!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, stop yer damn scrappin\'!"\r\n\r\nThe door of the Johnson home opened and Maggie looked out.  Jimmie made\r\na supreme cursing effort and hurled his mother into the room.  He\r\nquickly followed and closed the door.  The Rum Alley tenement swore\r\ndisappointedly and retired.\r\n\r\nThe mother slowly gathered herself up from the floor.  Her eyes\r\nglittered menacingly upon her children.\r\n\r\n"Here, now," said Jimmie, "we\'ve had enough of dis.  Sit down, an\' don\'\r\nmake no trouble."\r\n\r\nHe grasped her arm, and twisting it, forced her into a creaking chair.\r\n\r\n"Keep yer hands off me," roared his mother again.\r\n\r\n"Damn yer ol\' hide," yelled Jimmie, madly.  Maggie shrieked and ran\r\ninto the other room.  To her there came the sound of a storm of crashes\r\nand curses.  There was a great final thump and Jimmie\'s voice cried:\r\n"Dere, damn yeh, stay still."  Maggie opened the door now, and went\r\nwarily out.  "Oh, Jimmie."\r\n\r\nHe was leaning against the wall and swearing.  Blood stood upon bruises\r\non his knotty fore-arms where they had scraped against the floor or the\r\nwalls in the scuffle.  The mother lay screeching on the floor, the\r\ntears running down her furrowed face.\r\n\r\nMaggie, standing in the middle of the room, gazed about her.  The usual\r\nupheaval of the tables and chairs had taken place.  Crockery was strewn\r\nbroadcast in fragments.  The stove had been disturbed on its legs, and\r\nnow leaned idiotically to one side.  A pail had been upset and water\r\nspread in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Pete appeared.  He shrugged his shoulders.  "Oh,\r\nGawd," he observed.\r\n\r\nHe walked over to Maggie and whispered in her ear.  "Ah, what deh hell,\r\nMag?  Come ahn and we\'ll have a hell of a time."\r\n\r\nThe mother in the corner upreared her head and shook her tangled locks.\r\n\r\n"Teh hell wid him and you," she said, glowering at her daughter in the\r\ngloom.  Her eyes seemed to burn balefully.  "Yeh\'ve gone teh deh devil,\r\nMag Johnson, yehs knows yehs have gone teh deh devil.  Yer a disgrace\r\nteh yer people, damn yeh.  An\' now, git out an\' go ahn wid dat\r\ndoe-faced jude of yours.  Go teh hell wid him, damn yeh, an\' a good\r\nriddance.  Go teh hell an\' see how yeh likes it."\r\n\r\nMaggie gazed long at her mother.\r\n\r\n"Go teh hell now, an\' see how yeh likes it.  Git out.  I won\'t have\r\nsech as yehs in me house!  Get out, d\'yeh hear!  Damn yeh, git out!"\r\n\r\nThe girl began to tremble.\r\n\r\nAt this instant Pete came forward.  "Oh, what deh hell, Mag, see,"\r\nwhispered he softly in her ear.  "Dis all blows over.  See?  Deh ol\'\r\nwoman \'ill be all right in deh mornin\'.  Come ahn out wid me!  We\'ll\r\nhave a hell of a time."\r\n\r\nThe woman on the floor cursed.  Jimmie was intent upon his bruised\r\nfore-arms.  The girl cast a glance about the room filled with a chaotic\r\nmass of debris, and at the red, writhing body of her mother.\r\n\r\n"Go teh hell an\' good riddance."\r\n\r\nShe went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nJimmie had an idea it wasn\'t common courtesy for a friend to come to\r\none\'s home and ruin one\'s sister.  But he was not sure how much Pete\r\nknew about the rules of politeness.\r\n\r\nThe following night he returned home from work at rather a late hour in\r\nthe evening.  In passing through the halls he came upon the gnarled and\r\nleathery old woman who possessed the music box.  She was grinning in\r\nthe dim light that drifted through dust-stained panes.  She beckoned to\r\nhim with a smudged forefinger.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Jimmie, what do yehs t\'ink I got onto las\' night.  It was deh\r\nfunnies\' t\'ing I ever saw," she cried, coming close to him and leering.\r\nShe was trembling with eagerness to tell her tale.  "I was by me door\r\nlas\' night when yer sister and her jude feller came in late, oh, very\r\nlate.  An\' she, the dear, she was a-cryin\' as if her heart would break,\r\nshe was.  It was deh funnies\' t\'ing I ever saw.  An\' right out here by\r\nme door she asked him did he love her, did he.  An\' she was a-cryin\' as\r\nif her heart would break, poor t\'ing.  An\' him, I could see by deh way\r\nwhat he said it dat she had been askin\' orften, he says: \'Oh, hell,\r\nyes,\' he says, says he, \'Oh, hell, yes.\'"\r\n\r\nStorm-clouds swept over Jimmie\'s face, but he turned from the leathery\r\nold woman and plodded on up-stairs.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell, yes," called she after him.  She laughed a laugh that was\r\nlike a prophetic croak.  "\'Oh, hell, yes,\' he says, says he, \'Oh, hell,\r\nyes.\'"\r\n\r\nThere was no one in at home.  The rooms showed that attempts had been\r\nmade at tidying them.  Parts of the wreckage of the day before had been\r\nrepaired by an unskilful hand.  A chair or two and the table, stood\r\nuncertainly upon legs.  The floor had been newly swept.  Too, the blue\r\nribbons had been restored to the curtains, and the lambrequin, with its\r\nimmense sheaves of yellow wheat and red roses of equal size, had been\r\nreturned, in a worn and sorry state, to its position at the mantel.\r\nMaggie\'s jacket and hat were gone from the nail behind the door.\r\n\r\nJimmie walked to the window and began to look through the blurred\r\nglass.  It occurred to him to vaguely wonder, for an instant, if some\r\nof the women of his acquaintance had brothers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, he began to swear.\r\n\r\n"But he was me frien\'!  I brought \'im here!  Dat\'s deh hell of it!"\r\n\r\nHe fumed about the room, his anger gradually rising to the furious\r\npitch.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill deh jay!  Dat\'s what I\'ll do!  I\'ll kill deh jay!"\r\n\r\nHe clutched his hat and sprang toward the door.  But it opened and his\r\nmother\'s great form blocked the passage.\r\n\r\n"What deh hell\'s deh matter wid yeh?" exclaimed she, coming into the\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nJimmie gave vent to a sardonic curse and then laughed heavily.\r\n\r\n"Well, Maggie\'s gone teh deh devil!  Dat\'s what!  See?"\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said his mother.\r\n\r\n"Maggie\'s gone teh deh devil!  Are yehs deaf?" roared Jimmie,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Deh hell she has," murmured the mother, astounded.\r\n\r\nJimmie grunted, and then began to stare out at the window.  His mother\r\nsat down in a chair, but a moment later sprang erect and delivered a\r\nmaddened whirl of oaths.  Her son turned to look at her as she reeled\r\nand swayed in the middle of the room, her fierce face convulsed with\r\npassion, her blotched arms raised high in imprecation.\r\n\r\n"May Gawd curse her forever," she shrieked.  "May she eat nothin\' but\r\nstones and deh dirt in deh street.  May she sleep in deh gutter an\'\r\nnever see deh sun shine agin.  Deh damn--"\r\n\r\n"Here, now," said her son.  "Take a drop on yourself."\r\n\r\nThe mother raised lamenting eyes to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n"She\'s deh devil\'s own chil\', Jimmie," she whispered.  "Ah, who would\r\nt\'ink such a bad girl could grow up in our fambly, Jimmie, me son.\r\nMany deh hour I\'ve spent in talk wid dat girl an\' tol\' her if she ever\r\nwent on deh streets I\'d see her damned.  An\' after all her bringin\' up\r\nan\' what I tol\' her and talked wid her, she goes teh deh bad, like a\r\nduck teh water."\r\n\r\nThe tears rolled down her furrowed face.  Her hands trembled.\r\n\r\n"An\' den when dat Sadie MacMallister next door to us was sent teh deh\r\ndevil by dat feller what worked in deh soap-factory, didn\'t I tell our\r\nMag dat if she--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, dat\'s annuder story," interrupted the brother.  "Of course, dat\r\nSadie was nice an\' all dat--but--see--it ain\'t dessame as if--well,\r\nMaggie was diff\'ent--see--she was diff\'ent."\r\n\r\nHe was trying to formulate a theory that he had always unconsciously\r\nheld, that all sisters, excepting his own, could advisedly be ruined.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly broke out again.  "I\'ll go t\'ump hell outa deh mug what did\r\nher deh harm.  I\'ll kill \'im!  He t\'inks he kin scrap, but when he gits\r\nme a-chasin\' \'im he\'ll fin\' out where he\'s wrong, deh damned duffer.\r\nI\'ll wipe up deh street wid \'im."\r\n\r\nIn a fury he plunged out of the doorway.  As he vanished the mother\r\nraised her head and lifted both hands, entreating.\r\n\r\n"May Gawd curse her forever," she cried.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the hallway Jimmie discerned a knot of women talking\r\nvolubly.  When he strode by they paid no attention to him.\r\n\r\n"She allus was a bold thing," he heard one of them cry in an eager\r\nvoice.  "Dere wasn\'t a feller come teh deh house but she\'d try teh mash\r\n\'im.  My Annie says deh shameless t\'ing tried teh ketch her feller, her\r\nown feller, what we useter know his fader."\r\n\r\n"I could a\' tol\' yehs dis two years ago," said a woman, in a key of\r\ntriumph.  "Yessir, it was over two years ago dat I says teh my ol\' man,\r\nI says, \'Dat Johnson girl ain\'t straight,\' I says.  \'Oh, hell,\' he\r\nsays.  \'Oh, hell.\'  \'Dat\'s all right,\' I says, \'but I know what I\r\nknows,\' I says, \'an\' it \'ill come out later.  You wait an\' see,\' I\r\nsays, \'you see.\'"\r\n\r\n"Anybody what had eyes could see dat dere was somethin\' wrong wid dat\r\ngirl.  I didn\'t like her actions."\r\n\r\nOn the street Jimmie met a friend.  "What deh hell?" asked the latter.\r\n\r\nJimmie explained.  "An\' I\'ll t\'ump \'im till he can\'t stand."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what deh hell," said the friend.  "What\'s deh use!  Yeh\'ll git\r\npulled in!  Everybody \'ill be onto it!  An\' ten plunks!  Gee!"\r\n\r\nJimmie was determined.  "He t\'inks he kin scrap, but he\'ll fin\' out\r\ndiff\'ent."\r\n\r\n"Gee," remonstrated the friend.  "What deh hell?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nOn a corner a glass-fronted building shed a yellow glare upon the\r\npavements.  The open mouth of a saloon called seductively to passengers\r\nto enter and annihilate sorrow or create rage.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the place was papered in olive and bronze tints of\r\nimitation leather.  A shining bar of counterfeit massiveness extended\r\ndown the side of the room.  Behind it a great mahogany-appearing\r\nsideboard reached the ceiling.  Upon its shelves rested pyramids of\r\nshimmering glasses that were never disturbed.  Mirrors set in the face\r\nof the sideboard multiplied them.  Lemons, oranges and paper napkins,\r\narranged with mathematical precision, sat among the glasses.  Many-hued\r\ndecanters of liquor perched at regular intervals on the lower shelves.\r\nA nickel-plated cash register occupied a position in the exact centre\r\nof the general effect.  The elementary senses of it all seemed to be\r\nopulence and geometrical accuracy.\r\n\r\nAcross from the bar a smaller counter held a collection of plates upon\r\nwhich swarmed frayed fragments of crackers, slices of boiled ham,\r\ndishevelled bits of cheese, and pickles swimming in vinegar.  An odor\r\nof grasping, begrimed hands and munching mouths pervaded.\r\n\r\nPete, in a white jacket, was behind the bar bending expectantly toward\r\na quiet stranger.  "A beeh," said the man.  Pete drew a foam-topped\r\nglassful and set it dripping upon the bar.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the light bamboo doors at the entrance swung open and\r\ncrashed against the siding.  Jimmie and a companion entered.  They\r\nswaggered unsteadily but belligerently toward the bar and looked at\r\nPete with bleared and blinking eyes.\r\n\r\n"Gin," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Gin," said the companion.\r\n\r\nPete slid a bottle and two glasses along the bar.  He bended his head\r\nsideways as he assiduously polished away with a napkin at the gleaming\r\nwood.  He had a look of watchfulness upon his features.\r\n\r\nJimmie and his companion kept their eyes upon the bartender and\r\nconversed loudly in tones of contempt.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a dindy masher, ain\'t he, by Gawd?" laughed Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell, yes," said the companion, sneering widely.  "He\'s great, he\r\nis.  Git onto deh mug on deh blokie.  Dat\'s enough to make a feller\r\nturn hand-springs in \'is sleep."\r\n\r\nThe quiet stranger moved himself and his glass a trifle further away\r\nand maintained an attitude of oblivion.\r\n\r\n"Gee! ain\'t he hot stuff!"\r\n\r\n"Git onto his shape!  Great Gawd!"\r\n\r\n"Hey," cried Jimmie, in tones of command.  Pete came along slowly, with\r\na sullen dropping of the under lip.\r\n\r\n"Well," he growled, "what\'s eatin\' yehs?"\r\n\r\n"Gin," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Gin," said the companion.\r\n\r\nAs Pete confronted them with the bottle and the glasses, they laughed\r\nin his face.  Jimmie\'s companion, evidently overcome with merriment,\r\npointed a grimy forefinger in Pete\'s direction.\r\n\r\n"Say, Jimmie," demanded he, "what deh hell is dat behind deh bar?"\r\n\r\n"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie.  They laughed loudly.  Pete put\r\ndown a bottle with a bang and turned a formidable face toward them.  He\r\ndisclosed his teeth and his shoulders heaved restlessly.\r\n\r\n"You fellers can\'t guy me," he said.  "Drink yer stuff an\' git out an\'\r\ndon\' make no trouble."\r\n\r\nInstantly the laughter faded from the faces of the two men and\r\nexpressions of offended dignity immediately came.\r\n\r\n"Who deh hell has said anyt\'ing teh you," cried they in the same breath.\r\n\r\nThe quiet stranger looked at the door calculatingly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, come off," said Pete to the two men.  "Don\'t pick me up for no\r\njay.  Drink yer rum an\' git out an\' don\' make no trouble."\r\n\r\n"Oh, deh hell," airily cried Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, deh hell," airily repeated his companion.\r\n\r\n"We goes when we git ready!  See!" continued Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Pete in a threatening voice, "don\' make no trouble."\r\n\r\nJimmie suddenly leaned forward with his head on one side.  He snarled\r\nlike a wild animal.\r\n\r\n"Well, what if we does?  See?" said he.\r\n\r\nDark blood flushed into Pete\'s face, and he shot a lurid glance at\r\nJimmie.\r\n\r\n"Well, den we\'ll see whose deh bes\' man, you or me," he said.\r\n\r\nThe quiet stranger moved modestly toward the door.\r\n\r\nJimmie began to swell with valor.\r\n\r\n"Don\' pick me up fer no tenderfoot.  When yeh tackles me yeh tackles\r\none of deh bes\' men in deh city.  See?  I\'m a scrapper, I am.  Ain\'t\r\ndat right, Billie?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, Mike," responded his companion in tones of conviction.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell," said Pete, easily.  "Go fall on yerself."\r\n\r\nThe two men again began to laugh.\r\n\r\n"What deh hell is dat talkin\'?" cried the companion.\r\n\r\n"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie with exaggerated contempt.\r\n\r\nPete made a furious gesture.  "Git outa here now, an\' don\' make no\r\ntrouble.  See?  Youse fellers er lookin\' fer a scrap an\' it\'s damn\r\nlikely yeh\'ll fin\' one if yeh keeps on shootin\' off yer mout\'s.  I know\r\nyehs!  See?  I kin lick better men dan yehs ever saw in yer lifes.\r\nDat\'s right!  See?  Don\' pick me up fer no stuff er yeh might be jolted\r\nout in deh street before yeh knows where yeh is.  When I comes from\r\nbehind dis bar, I t\'rows yehs bote inteh deh street.  See?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell," cried the two men in chorus.\r\n\r\nThe glare of a panther came into Pete\'s eyes.  "Dat\'s what I said!\r\nUnnerstan\'?"\r\n\r\nHe came through a passage at the end of the bar and swelled down upon\r\nthe two men.  They stepped promptly forward and crowded close to him.\r\n\r\nThey bristled like three roosters.  They moved their heads pugnaciously\r\nand kept their shoulders braced.  The nervous muscles about each mouth\r\ntwitched with a forced smile of mockery.\r\n\r\n"Well, what deh hell yer goin\' teh do?" gritted Jimmie.\r\n\r\nPete stepped warily back, waving his hands before him to keep the men\r\nfrom coming too near.\r\n\r\n"Well, what deh hell yer goin\' teh do?" repeated Jimmie\'s ally.  They\r\nkept close to him, taunting and leering.  They strove to make him\r\nattempt the initial blow.\r\n\r\n"Keep back, now!  Don\' crowd me," ominously said Pete.\r\n\r\nAgain they chorused in contempt.  "Oh, hell!"\r\n\r\nIn a small, tossing group, the three men edged for positions like\r\nfrigates contemplating battle.\r\n\r\n"Well, why deh hell don\' yeh try teh t\'row us out?" cried Jimmie and\r\nhis ally with copious sneers.\r\n\r\nThe bravery of bull-dogs sat upon the faces of the men.  Their clenched\r\nfists moved like eager weapons.\r\n\r\nThe allied two jostled the bartender\'s elbows, glaring at him with\r\nfeverish eyes and forcing him toward the wall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Pete swore redly.  The flash of action gleamed from his eyes.\r\nHe threw back his arm and aimed a tremendous, lightning-like blow at\r\nJimmie\'s face.  His foot swung a step forward and the weight of his\r\nbody was behind his fist.  Jimmie ducked his head, Bowery-like, with\r\nthe quickness of a cat.  The fierce, answering blows of him and his\r\nally crushed on Pete\'s bowed head.\r\n\r\nThe quiet stranger vanished.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the combatants whirled in the air like flails.  The faces\r\nof the men, at first flushed to flame-colored anger, now began to fade\r\nto the pallor of warriors in the blood and heat of a battle.  Their\r\nlips curled back and stretched tightly over the gums in ghoul-like\r\ngrins.  Through their white, gripped teeth struggled hoarse whisperings\r\nof oaths.  Their eyes glittered with murderous fire.\r\n\r\nEach head was huddled between its owner\'s shoulders, and arms were\r\nswinging with marvelous rapidity.  Feet scraped to and fro with a loud\r\nscratching sound upon the sanded floor.  Blows left crimson blotches\r\nupon pale skin.  The curses of the first quarter minute of the fight\r\ndied away.  The breaths of the fighters came wheezingly from their lips\r\nand the three chests were straining and heaving.  Pete at intervals\r\ngave vent to low, labored hisses, that sounded like a desire to kill.\r\nJimmie\'s ally gibbered at times like a wounded maniac.  Jimmie was\r\nsilent, fighting with the face of a sacrificial priest.  The rage of\r\nfear shone in all their eyes and their blood-colored fists swirled.\r\n\r\nAt a tottering moment a blow from Pete\'s hand struck the ally and he\r\ncrashed to the floor.  He wriggled instantly to his feet and grasping\r\nthe quiet stranger\'s beer glass from the bar, hurled it at Pete\'s head.\r\n\r\nHigh on the wall it burst like a bomb, shivering fragments flying in\r\nall directions.  Then missiles came to every man\'s hand.  The place had\r\nheretofore appeared free of things to throw, but suddenly glass and\r\nbottles went singing through the air.  They were thrown point blank at\r\nbobbing heads.  The pyramid of shimmering glasses, that had never been\r\ndisturbed, changed to cascades as heavy bottles were flung into them.\r\nMirrors splintered to nothing.\r\n\r\nThe three frothing creatures on the floor buried themselves in a frenzy\r\nfor blood.  There followed in the wake of missiles and fists some\r\nunknown prayers, perhaps for death.\r\n\r\nThe quiet stranger had sprawled very pyrotechnically out on the\r\nsidewalk.  A laugh ran up and down the avenue for the half of a block.\r\n\r\n"Dey\'ve trowed a bloke inteh deh street."\r\n\r\nPeople heard the sound of breaking glass and shuffling feet within the\r\nsaloon and came running.  A small group, bending down to look under the\r\nbamboo doors, watching the fall of glass, and three pairs of violent\r\nlegs, changed in a moment to a crowd.\r\n\r\nA policeman came charging down the sidewalk and bounced through the\r\ndoors into the saloon.  The crowd bended and surged in absorbing\r\nanxiety to see.\r\n\r\nJimmie caught first sight of the on-coming interruption.  On his feet\r\nhe had the same regard for a policeman that, when on his truck, he had\r\nfor a fire engine.  He howled and ran for the side door.\r\n\r\nThe officer made a terrific advance, club in hand.  One comprehensive\r\nsweep of the long night stick threw the ally to the floor and forced\r\nPete to a corner.  With his disengaged hand he made a furious effort at\r\nJimmie\'s coat-tails.  Then he regained his balance and paused.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, you are a pair of pictures.  What in hell yeh been up to?"\r\n\r\nJimmie, with his face drenched in blood, escaped up a side street,\r\npursued a short distance by some of the more law-loving, or excited\r\nindividuals of the crowd.\r\n\r\nLater, from a corner safely dark, he saw the policeman, the ally and\r\nthe bartender emerge from the saloon.  Pete locked the doors and then\r\nfollowed up the avenue in the rear of the crowd-encompassed policeman\r\nand his charge.\r\n\r\nOn first thoughts Jimmie, with his heart throbbing at battle heat,\r\nstarted to go desperately to the rescue of his friend, but he halted.\r\n\r\n"Ah, what deh hell?" he demanded of himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nIn a hall of irregular shape sat Pete and Maggie drinking beer.  A\r\nsubmissive orchestra dictated to by a spectacled man with frowsy hair\r\nand a dress suit, industriously followed the bobs of his head and the\r\nwaves of his baton.  A ballad singer, in a dress of flaming scarlet,\r\nsang in the inevitable voice of brass.  When she vanished, men seated\r\nat the tables near the front applauded loudly, pounding the polished\r\nwood with their beer glasses.  She returned attired in less gown, and\r\nsang again.  She received another enthusiastic encore.  She reappeared\r\nin still less gown and danced.  The deafening rumble of glasses and\r\nclapping of hands that followed her exit indicated an overwhelming\r\ndesire to have her come on for the fourth time, but the curiosity of\r\nthe audience was not gratified.\r\n\r\nMaggie was pale.  From her eyes had been plucked all look of\r\nself-reliance.  She leaned with a dependent air toward her companion.\r\nShe was timid, as if fearing his anger or displeasure.  She seemed to\r\nbeseech tenderness of him.\r\n\r\nPete\'s air of distinguished valor had grown upon him until it\r\nthreatened stupendous dimensions.  He was infinitely gracious to the\r\ngirl.  It was apparent to her that his condescension was a marvel.\r\n\r\nHe could appear to strut even while sitting still and he showed that he\r\nwas a lion of lordly characteristics by the air with which he spat.\r\n\r\nWith Maggie gazing at him wonderingly, he took pride in commanding the\r\nwaiters who were, however, indifferent or deaf.\r\n\r\n"Hi, you, git a russle on yehs!  What deh hell yehs lookin\' at?  Two\r\nmore beehs, d\'yeh hear?"\r\n\r\nHe leaned back and critically regarded the person of a girl with a\r\nstraw-colored wig who upon the stage was flinging her heels in somewhat\r\nawkward imitation of a well-known danseuse.\r\n\r\nAt times Maggie told Pete long confidential tales of her former home\r\nlife, dwelling upon the escapades of the other members of the family\r\nand the difficulties she had to combat in order to obtain a degree of\r\ncomfort.  He responded in tones of philanthropy.  He pressed her arm\r\nwith an air of reassuring proprietorship.\r\n\r\n"Dey was damn jays," he said, denouncing the mother and brother.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the music which, by the efforts of the frowsy-headed\r\nleader, drifted to her ears through the smoke-filled atmosphere, made\r\nthe girl dream.  She thought of her former Rum Alley environment and\r\nturned to regard Pete\'s strong protecting fists.  She thought of the\r\ncollar and cuff manufactory and the eternal moan of the proprietor:\r\n"What een hell do you sink I pie fife dolla a week for?  Play?  No, py\r\ndamn."  She contemplated Pete\'s man-subduing eyes and noted that wealth\r\nand prosperity was indicated by his clothes.  She imagined a future,\r\nrose-tinted, because of its distance from all that she previously had\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nAs to the present she perceived only vague reasons to be miserable.\r\nHer life was Pete\'s and she considered him worthy of the charge.  She\r\nwould be disturbed by no particular apprehensions, so long as Pete\r\nadored her as he now said he did.  She did not feel like a bad woman.\r\nTo her knowledge she had never seen any better.\r\n\r\nAt times men at other tables regarded the girl furtively.  Pete, aware\r\nof it, nodded at her and grinned.  He felt proud.\r\n\r\n"Mag, yer a bloomin\' good-looker," he remarked, studying her face\r\nthrough the haze.  The men made Maggie fear, but she blushed at Pete\'s\r\nwords as it became apparent to her that she was the apple of his eye.\r\n\r\nGrey-headed men, wonderfully pathetic in their dissipation, stared at\r\nher through clouds.  Smooth-cheeked boys, some of them with faces of\r\nstone and mouths of sin, not nearly so pathetic as the grey heads,\r\ntried to find the girl\'s eyes in the smoke wreaths.  Maggie considered\r\nshe was not what they thought her.  She confined her glances to Pete\r\nand the stage.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra played negro melodies and a versatile drummer pounded,\r\nwhacked, clattered and scratched on a dozen machines to make noise.\r\n\r\nThose glances of the men, shot at Maggie from under half-closed lids,\r\nmade her tremble.  She thought them all to be worse men than Pete.\r\n\r\n"Come, let\'s go," she said.\r\n\r\nAs they went out Maggie perceived two women seated at a table with some\r\nmen.  They were painted and their cheeks had lost their roundness.  As\r\nshe passed them the girl, with a shrinking movement, drew back her\r\nskirts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nJimmie did not return home for a number of days after the fight with\r\nPete in the saloon.  When he did, he approached with extreme caution.\r\n\r\nHe found his mother raving.  Maggie had not returned home.  The parent\r\ncontinually wondered how her daughter could come to such a pass.  She\r\nhad never considered Maggie as a pearl dropped unstained into Rum Alley\r\nfrom Heaven, but she could not conceive how it was possible for her\r\ndaughter to fall so low as to bring disgrace upon her family.  She was\r\nterrific in denunciation of the girl\'s wickedness.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the neighbors talked of it, maddened her.  When women\r\ncame in, and in the course of their conversation casually asked,\r\n"Where\'s Maggie dese days?" the mother shook her fuzzy head at them and\r\nappalled them with curses.  Cunning hints inviting confidence she\r\nrebuffed with violence.\r\n\r\n"An\' wid all deh bringin\' up she had, how could she?" moaningly she\r\nasked of her son.  "Wid all deh talkin\' wid her I did an\' deh t\'ings I\r\ntol\' her to remember?  When a girl is bringed up deh way I bringed up\r\nMaggie, how kin she go teh deh devil?"\r\n\r\nJimmie was transfixed by these questions.  He could not conceive how\r\nunder the circumstances his mother\'s daughter and his sister could have\r\nbeen so wicked.\r\n\r\nHis mother took a drink from a squdgy bottle that sat on the table.\r\nShe continued her lament.\r\n\r\n"She had a bad heart, dat girl did, Jimmie.  She was wicked teh deh\r\nheart an\' we never knowed it."\r\n\r\nJimmie nodded, admitting the fact.\r\n\r\n"We lived in deh same house wid her an\' I brought her up an\' we never\r\nknowed how bad she was."\r\n\r\nJimmie nodded again.\r\n\r\n"Wid a home like dis an\' a mudder like me, she went teh deh bad," cried\r\nthe mother, raising her eyes.\r\n\r\nOne day, Jimmie came home, sat down in a chair and began to wriggle\r\nabout with a new and strange nervousness.  At last he spoke\r\nshamefacedly.\r\n\r\n"Well, look-a-here, dis t\'ing queers us!  See?  We\'re queered!  An\'\r\nmaybe it \'ud be better if I--well, I t\'ink I kin look \'er up an\'--maybe\r\nit \'ud be better if I fetched her home an\'--"\r\n\r\nThe mother started from her chair and broke forth into a storm of\r\npassionate anger.\r\n\r\n"What!  Let \'er come an\' sleep under deh same roof wid her mudder agin!\r\nOh, yes, I will, won\'t I?  Sure?  Shame on yehs, Jimmie Johnson, for\r\nsayin\' such a t\'ing teh yer own mudder--teh yer own mudder!  Little did\r\nI t\'ink when yehs was a babby playin\' about me feet dat ye\'d grow up\r\nteh say sech a t\'ing teh yer mudder--yer own mudder.  I never taut--"\r\n\r\nSobs choked her and interrupted her reproaches.\r\n\r\n"Dere ain\'t nottin\' teh raise sech hell about," said Jimmie.  "I on\'y\r\nsays it \'ud be better if we keep dis t\'ing dark, see?  It queers us!\r\nSee?"\r\n\r\nHis mother laughed a laugh that seemed to ring through the city and be\r\nechoed and re-echoed by countless other laughs.  "Oh, yes, I will,\r\nwon\'t I!  Sure!"\r\n\r\n"Well, yeh must take me fer a damn fool," said Jimmie, indignant at his\r\nmother for mocking him.  "I didn\'t say we\'d make \'er inteh a little tin\r\nangel, ner nottin\', but deh way it is now she can queer us!  Don\' che\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, she\'ll git tired of deh life atter a while an\' den she\'ll wanna\r\nbe a-comin\' home, won\' she, deh beast!  I\'ll let \'er in den, won\' I?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\' mean none of dis prod\'gal bus\'ness anyway," explained\r\nJimmie.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t no prod\'gal dauter, yeh damn fool," said the mother.  "It\r\nwas prod\'gal son, anyhow."\r\n\r\n"I know dat," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\nFor a time they sat in silence.  The mother\'s eyes gloated on a scene\r\nher imagination could call before her.  Her lips were set in a\r\nvindictive smile.\r\n\r\n"Aye, she\'ll cry, won\' she, an\' carry on, an\' tell how Pete, or some\r\nodder feller, beats \'er an\' she\'ll say she\'s sorry an\' all dat an\' she\r\nain\'t happy, she ain\'t, an\' she wants to come home agin, she does."\r\n\r\nWith grim humor, the mother imitated the possible wailing notes of the\r\ndaughter\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Den I\'ll take \'er in, won\'t I, deh beast.  She kin cry \'er two eyes\r\nout on deh stones of deh street before I\'ll dirty deh place wid her.\r\nShe abused an\' ill-treated her own mudder--her own mudder what loved\r\nher an\' she\'ll never git anodder chance dis side of hell."\r\n\r\nJimmie thought he had a great idea of women\'s frailty, but he could not\r\nunderstand why any of his kin should be victims.\r\n\r\n"Damn her," he fervidly said.\r\n\r\nAgain he wondered vaguely if some of the women of his acquaintance had\r\nbrothers.  Nevertheless, his mind did not for an instant confuse\r\nhimself with those brothers nor his sister with theirs.  After the\r\nmother had, with great difficulty, suppressed the neighbors, she went\r\namong them and proclaimed her grief.  "May Gawd forgive dat girl," was\r\nher continual cry.  To attentive ears she recited the whole length and\r\nbreadth of her woes.\r\n\r\n"I bringed \'er up deh way a dauter oughta be bringed up an\' dis is how\r\nshe served me!  She went teh deh devil deh first chance she got!  May\r\nGawd forgive her."\r\n\r\nWhen arrested for drunkenness she used the story of her daughter\'s\r\ndownfall with telling effect upon the police justices.  Finally one of\r\nthem said to her, peering down over his spectacles: "Mary, the records\r\nof this and other courts show that you are the mother of forty-two\r\ndaughters who have been ruined.  The case is unparalleled in the annals\r\nof this court, and this court thinks--"\r\n\r\nThe mother went through life shedding large tears of sorrow.  Her red\r\nface was a picture of agony.\r\n\r\nOf course Jimmie publicly damned his sister that he might appear on a\r\nhigher social plane.  But, arguing with himself, stumbling about in\r\nways that he knew not, he, once, almost came to a conclusion that his\r\nsister would have been more firmly good had she better known why.\r\nHowever, he felt that he could not hold such a view.  He threw it\r\nhastily aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nIn a hilarious hall there were twenty-eight tables and twenty-eight\r\nwomen and a crowd of smoking men.  Valiant noise was made on a stage at\r\nthe end of the hall by an orchestra composed of men who looked as if\r\nthey had just happened in.  Soiled waiters ran to and fro, swooping\r\ndown like hawks on the unwary in the throng; clattering along the\r\naisles with trays covered with glasses; stumbling over women\'s skirts\r\nand charging two prices for everything but beer, all with a swiftness\r\nthat blurred the view of the cocoanut palms and dusty monstrosities\r\npainted upon the walls of the room.  A bouncer, with an immense load of\r\nbusiness upon his hands, plunged about in the crowd, dragging bashful\r\nstrangers to prominent chairs, ordering waiters here and there and\r\nquarreling furiously with men who wanted to sing with the orchestra.\r\n\r\nThe usual smoke cloud was present, but so dense that heads and arms\r\nseemed entangled in it.  The rumble of conversation was replaced by a\r\nroar.  Plenteous oaths heaved through the air.  The room rang with the\r\nshrill voices of women bubbling o\'er with drink-laughter.  The chief\r\nelement in the music of the orchestra was speed.  The musicians played\r\nin intent fury.  A woman was singing and smiling upon the stage, but no\r\none took notice of her.  The rate at which the piano, cornet and\r\nviolins were going, seemed to impart wildness to the half-drunken\r\ncrowd.  Beer glasses were emptied at a gulp and conversation became a\r\nrapid chatter.  The smoke eddied and swirled like a shadowy river\r\nhurrying toward some unseen falls.  Pete and Maggie entered the hall\r\nand took chairs at a table near the door.  The woman who was seated\r\nthere made an attempt to occupy Pete\'s attention and, failing, went\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThree weeks had passed since the girl had left home.  The air of\r\nspaniel-like dependence had been magnified and showed its direct effect\r\nin the peculiar off-handedness and ease of Pete\'s ways toward her.\r\n\r\nShe followed Pete\'s eyes with hers, anticipating with smiles gracious\r\nlooks from him.\r\n\r\nA woman of brilliance and audacity, accompanied by a mere boy, came\r\ninto the place and took seats near them.\r\n\r\nAt once Pete sprang to his feet, his face beaming with glad surprise.\r\n\r\n"By Gawd, there\'s Nellie," he cried.\r\n\r\nHe went over to the table and held out an eager hand to the woman.\r\n\r\n"Why, hello, Pete, me boy, how are you," said she, giving him her\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nMaggie took instant note of the woman.  She perceived that her black\r\ndress fitted her to perfection.  Her linen collar and cuffs were\r\nspotless.  Tan gloves were stretched over her well-shaped hands.  A hat\r\nof a prevailing fashion perched jauntily upon her dark hair.  She wore\r\nno jewelry and was painted with no apparent paint.  She looked\r\nclear-eyed through the stares of the men.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, and call your lady-friend over," she said cordially to Pete.\r\nAt his beckoning Maggie came and sat between Pete and the mere boy.\r\n\r\n"I thought yeh were gone away fer good," began Pete, at once.  "When\r\ndid yeh git back?  How did dat Buff\'lo bus\'ness turn out?"\r\n\r\nThe woman shrugged her shoulders.  "Well, he didn\'t have as many stamps\r\nas he tried to make out, so I shook him, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m glad teh see yehs back in deh city," said Pete, with awkward\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\nHe and the woman entered into a long conversation, exchanging\r\nreminiscences of days together.  Maggie sat still, unable to formulate\r\nan intelligent sentence upon the conversation and painfully aware of it.\r\n\r\nShe saw Pete\'s eyes sparkle as he gazed upon the handsome stranger.  He\r\nlistened smilingly to all she said.  The woman was familiar with all\r\nhis affairs, asked him about mutual friends, and knew the amount of his\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\nShe paid no attention to Maggie, looking toward her once or twice and\r\napparently seeing the wall beyond.\r\n\r\nThe mere boy was sulky.  In the beginning he had welcomed with\r\nacclamations the additions.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s all have a drink!  What\'ll you take, Nell?  And you, Miss\r\nwhat\'s-your-name.  Have a drink, Mr. -----, you, I mean."\r\n\r\nHe had shown a sprightly desire to do the talking for the company and\r\ntell all about his family.  In a loud voice he declaimed on various\r\ntopics.  He assumed a patronizing air toward Pete.  As Maggie was\r\nsilent, he paid no attention to her.  He made a great show of lavishing\r\nwealth upon the woman of brilliance and audacity.\r\n\r\n"Do keep still, Freddie!  You gibber like an ape, dear," said the woman\r\nto him.  She turned away and devoted her attention to Pete.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have many a good time together again, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, Mike," said Pete, enthusiastic at once.\r\n\r\n"Say," whispered she, leaning forward, "let\'s go over to Billie\'s and\r\nhave a heluva time."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s dis way!  See?" said Pete.  "I got dis lady frien\' here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, t\'hell with her," argued the woman.\r\n\r\nPete appeared disturbed.\r\n\r\n"All right," said she, nodding her head at him.  "All right for you!\r\nWe\'ll see the next time you ask me to go anywheres with you."\r\n\r\nPete squirmed.\r\n\r\n"Say," he said, beseechingly, "come wid me a minit an\' I\'ll tell yer\r\nwhy."\r\n\r\nThe woman waved her hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all right, you needn\'t explain, you know.  You wouldn\'t\r\ncome merely because you wouldn\'t come, that\'s all there is of it."\r\n\r\nTo Pete\'s visible distress she turned to the mere boy, bringing him\r\nspeedily from a terrific rage.  He had been debating whether it would\r\nbe the part of a man to pick a quarrel with Pete, or would he be\r\njustified in striking him savagely with his beer glass without warning.\r\nBut he recovered himself when the woman turned to renew her smilings.\r\nHe beamed upon her with an expression that was somewhat tipsy and\r\ninexpressibly tender.\r\n\r\n"Say, shake that Bowery jay," requested he, in a loud whisper.\r\n\r\n"Freddie, you are so droll," she replied.\r\n\r\nPete reached forward and touched the woman on the arm.\r\n\r\n"Come out a minit while I tells yeh why I can\'t go wid yer.  Yer doin\'\r\nme dirt, Nell!  I never taut ye\'d do me dirt, Nell.  Come on, will\r\nyer?"  He spoke in tones of injury.\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t see why I should be interested in your explanations,"\r\nsaid the woman, with a coldness that seemed to reduce Pete to a pulp.\r\n\r\nHis eyes pleaded with her.  "Come out a minit while I tells yeh."\r\n\r\nThe woman nodded slightly at Maggie and the mere boy, "\'Scuse me."\r\n\r\nThe mere boy interrupted his loving smile and turned a shrivelling\r\nglare upon Pete.  His boyish countenance flushed and he spoke, in a\r\nwhine, to the woman:\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, Nellie, this ain\'t a square deal, you know.  You aren\'t\r\ngoin\' to leave me and go off with that duffer, are you?  I should\r\nthink--"\r\n\r\n"Why, you dear boy, of course I\'m not," cried the woman,\r\naffectionately.  She bended over and whispered in his ear.  He smiled\r\nagain and settled in his chair as if resolved to wait patiently.\r\n\r\nAs the woman walked down between the rows of tables, Pete was at her\r\nshoulder talking earnestly, apparently in explanation.  The woman waved\r\nher hands with studied airs of indifference.  The doors swung behind\r\nthem, leaving Maggie and the mere boy seated at the table.\r\n\r\nMaggie was dazed.  She could dimly perceive that something stupendous\r\nhad happened.  She wondered why Pete saw fit to remonstrate with the\r\nwoman, pleading for forgiveness with his eyes.  She thought she noted\r\nan air of submission about her leonine Pete.  She was astounded.\r\n\r\nThe mere boy occupied himself with cock-tails and a cigar.  He was\r\ntranquilly silent for half an hour.  Then he bestirred himself and\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, sighing, "I knew this was the way it would be." There\r\nwas another stillness.  The mere boy seemed to be musing.\r\n\r\n"She was pulling m\'leg.  That\'s the whole amount of it," he said,\r\nsuddenly.  "It\'s a bloomin\' shame the way that girl does.  Why, I\'ve\r\nspent over two dollars in drinks to-night.  And she goes off with that\r\nplug-ugly who looks as if he had been hit in the face with a coin-die.\r\nI call it rocky treatment for a fellah like me.  Here, waiter, bring me\r\na cock-tail and make it damned strong."\r\n\r\nMaggie made no reply.  She was watching the doors.  "It\'s a mean piece\r\nof business," complained the mere boy.  He explained to her how amazing\r\nit was that anybody should treat him in such a manner.  "But I\'ll get\r\nsquare with her, you bet.  She won\'t get far ahead of yours truly, you\r\nknow," he added, winking.  "I\'ll tell her plainly that it was bloomin\'\r\nmean business.  And she won\'t come it over me with any of her\r\n\'now-Freddie-dears.\'  She thinks my name is Freddie, you know, but of\r\ncourse it ain\'t.  I always tell these people some name like that,\r\nbecause if they got onto your right name they might use it sometime.\r\nUnderstand?  Oh, they don\'t fool me much."\r\n\r\nMaggie was paying no attention, being intent upon the doors.  The mere\r\nboy relapsed into a period of gloom, during which he exterminated a\r\nnumber of cock-tails with a determined air, as if replying defiantly to\r\nfate.  He occasionally broke forth into sentences composed of\r\ninvectives joined together in a long string.\r\n\r\nThe girl was still staring at the doors.  After a time the mere boy\r\nbegan to see cobwebs just in front of his nose.  He spurred himself\r\ninto being agreeable and insisted upon her having a charlotte-russe and\r\na glass of beer.\r\n\r\n"They\'s gone," he remarked, "they\'s gone."  He looked at her through\r\nthe smoke wreaths.  "Shay, lil\' girl, we mightish well make bes\' of it.\r\nYou ain\'t such bad-lookin\' girl, y\'know.  Not half bad.  Can\'t come up\r\nto Nell, though.  No, can\'t do it!  Well, I should shay not!  Nell\r\nfine-lookin\' girl!  F--i--n--ine.  You look damn bad longsider her, but\r\nby y\'self ain\'t so bad.  Have to do anyhow.  Nell gone.  On\'y you left.\r\nNot half bad, though."\r\n\r\nMaggie stood up.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going home," she said.\r\n\r\nThe mere boy started.\r\n\r\n"Eh?  What?  Home," he cried, struck with amazement.  "I beg pardon,\r\ndid hear say home?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going home," she repeated.\r\n\r\n"Great Gawd, what hava struck," demanded the mere boy of himself,\r\nstupefied.\r\n\r\nIn a semi-comatose state he conducted her on board an up-town car,\r\nostentatiously paid her fare, leered kindly at her through the rear\r\nwindow and fell off the steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nA forlorn woman went along a lighted avenue.  The street was filled\r\nwith people desperately bound on missions.  An endless crowd darted at\r\nthe elevated station stairs and the horse cars were thronged with\r\nowners of bundles.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the forlorn woman was slow.  She was apparently searching\r\nfor some one.  She loitered near the doors of saloons and watched men\r\nemerge from them.  She scanned furtively the faces in the rushing\r\nstream of pedestrians.  Hurrying men, bent on catching some boat or\r\ntrain, jostled her elbows, failing to notice her, their thoughts fixed\r\non distant dinners.\r\n\r\nThe forlorn woman had a peculiar face.  Her smile was no smile.  But\r\nwhen in repose her features had a shadowy look that was like a sardonic\r\ngrin, as if some one had sketched with cruel forefinger indelible lines\r\nabout her mouth.\r\n\r\nJimmie came strolling up the avenue.  The woman encountered him with an\r\naggrieved air.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jimmie, I\'ve been lookin\' all over fer yehs--," she began.\r\n\r\nJimmie made an impatient gesture and quickened his pace.\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t bodder me!  Good Gawd!" he said, with the savageness of a\r\nman whose life is pestered.\r\n\r\nThe woman followed him along the sidewalk in somewhat the manner of a\r\nsuppliant.\r\n\r\n"But, Jimmie," she said, "yehs told me ye\'d--"\r\n\r\nJimmie turned upon her fiercely as if resolved to make a last stand for\r\ncomfort and peace.\r\n\r\n"Say, fer Gawd\'s sake, Hattie, don\' foller me from one end of deh city\r\nteh deh odder.  Let up, will yehs!  Give me a minute\'s res\', can\'t\r\nyehs?  Yehs makes me tired, allus taggin\' me.  See?  Ain\' yehs got no\r\nsense.  Do yehs want people teh get onto me?  Go chase yerself, fer\r\nGawd\'s sake."\r\n\r\nThe woman stepped closer and laid her fingers on his arm.  "But,\r\nlook-a-here--"\r\n\r\nJimmie snarled.  "Oh, go teh hell."\r\n\r\nHe darted into the front door of a convenient saloon and a moment later\r\ncame out into the shadows that surrounded the side door.  On the\r\nbrilliantly lighted avenue he perceived the forlorn woman dodging about\r\nlike a scout.  Jimmie laughed with an air of relief and went away.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived home he found his mother clamoring.  Maggie had\r\nreturned.  She stood shivering beneath the torrent of her mother\'s\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m damned," said Jimmie in greeting.\r\n\r\nHis mother, tottering about the room, pointed a quivering forefinger.\r\n\r\n"Lookut her, Jimmie, lookut her.  Dere\'s yer sister, boy.  Dere\'s yer\r\nsister.  Lookut her!  Lookut her!"\r\n\r\nShe screamed in scoffing laughter.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood in the middle of the room.  She edged about as if unable\r\nto find a place on the floor to put her feet.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha," bellowed the mother.  "Dere she stands!  Ain\' she purty?\r\nLookut her!  Ain\' she sweet, deh beast?  Lookut her!  Ha, ha, lookut\r\nher!"\r\n\r\nShe lurched forward and put her red and seamed hands upon her\r\ndaughter\'s face.  She bent down and peered keenly up into the eyes of\r\nthe girl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s jes\' dessame as she ever was, ain\' she?  She\'s her mudder\'s\r\npurty darlin\' yit, ain\' she?  Lookut her, Jimmie!  Come here, fer\r\nGawd\'s sake, and lookut her."\r\n\r\nThe loud, tremendous sneering of the mother brought the denizens of the\r\nRum Alley tenement to their doors.  Women came in the hallways.\r\nChildren scurried to and fro.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up?  Dat Johnson party on anudder tear?"\r\n\r\n"Naw!  Young Mag\'s come home!"\r\n\r\n"Deh hell yeh say?"\r\n\r\nThrough the open door curious eyes stared in at Maggie.  Children\r\nventured into the room and ogled her, as if they formed the front row\r\nat a theatre.  Women, without, bended toward each other and whispered,\r\nnodding their heads with airs of profound philosophy.  A baby, overcome\r\nwith curiosity concerning this object at which all were looking, sidled\r\nforward and touched her dress, cautiously, as if investigating a\r\nred-hot stove.  Its mother\'s voice rang out like a warning trumpet.\r\nShe rushed forward and grabbed her child, casting a terrible look of\r\nindignation at the girl.\r\n\r\nMaggie\'s mother paced to and fro, addressing the doorful of eyes,\r\nexpounding like a glib showman at a museum.  Her voice rang through the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n"Dere she stands," she cried, wheeling suddenly and pointing with\r\ndramatic finger.  "Dere she stands!  Lookut her!  Ain\' she a dindy?\r\nAn\' she was so good as to come home teh her mudder, she was!  Ain\' she\r\na beaut\'?  Ain\' she a dindy?  Fer Gawd\'s sake!"\r\n\r\nThe jeering cries ended in another burst of shrill laughter.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to awaken.  "Jimmie--"\r\n\r\nHe drew hastily back from her.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, yer a hell of a t\'ing, ain\' yeh?" he said, his lips curling\r\nin scorn.  Radiant virtue sat upon his brow and his repelling hands\r\nexpressed horror of contamination.\r\n\r\nMaggie turned and went.\r\n\r\nThe crowd at the door fell back precipitately.  A baby falling down in\r\nfront of the door, wrenched a scream like a wounded animal from its\r\nmother.  Another woman sprang forward and picked it up, with a\r\nchivalrous air, as if rescuing a human being from an oncoming express\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nAs the girl passed down through the hall, she went before open doors\r\nframing more eyes strangely microscopic, and sending broad beams of\r\ninquisitive light into the darkness of her path.  On the second floor\r\nshe met the gnarled old woman who possessed the music box.\r\n\r\n"So," she cried, "\'ere yehs are back again, are yehs?  An\' dey\'ve\r\nkicked yehs out?  Well, come in an\' stay wid me teh-night.  I ain\' got\r\nno moral standin\'."\r\n\r\nFrom above came an unceasing babble of tongues, over all of which rang\r\nthe mother\'s derisive laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nPete did not consider that he had ruined Maggie.  If he had thought\r\nthat her soul could never smile again, he would have believed the\r\nmother and brother, who were pyrotechnic over the affair, to be\r\nresponsible for it.\r\n\r\nBesides, in his world, souls did not insist upon being able to smile.\r\n"What deh hell?"\r\n\r\nHe felt a trifle entangled.  It distressed him.  Revelations and scenes\r\nmight bring upon him the wrath of the owner of the saloon, who insisted\r\nupon respectability of an advanced type.\r\n\r\n"What deh hell do dey wanna raise such a smoke about it fer?" demanded\r\nhe of himself, disgusted with the attitude of the family.  He saw no\r\nnecessity for anyone\'s losing their equilibrium merely because their\r\nsister or their daughter had stayed away from home.\r\n\r\nSearching about in his mind for possible reasons for their conduct, he\r\ncame upon the conclusion that Maggie\'s motives were correct, but that\r\nthe two others wished to snare him.  He felt pursued.\r\n\r\nThe woman of brilliance and audacity whom he had met in the hilarious\r\nhall showed a disposition to ridicule him.\r\n\r\n"A little pale thing with no spirit," she said.  "Did you note the\r\nexpression of her eyes?  There was something in them about pumpkin pie\r\nand virtue.  That is a peculiar way the left corner of her mouth has of\r\ntwitching, isn\'t it?  Dear, dear, my cloud-compelling Pete, what are\r\nyou coming to?"\r\n\r\nPete asserted at once that he never was very much interested in the\r\ngirl.  The woman interrupted him, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s not of the slightest consequence to me, my dear young man.\r\nYou needn\'t draw maps for my benefit.  Why should I be concerned about\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nBut Pete continued with his explanations.  If he was laughed at for his\r\ntastes in women, he felt obliged to say that they were only temporary\r\nor indifferent ones.\r\n\r\nThe morning after Maggie had departed from home, Pete stood behind the\r\nbar.  He was immaculate in white jacket and apron and his hair was\r\nplastered over his brow with infinite correctness.  No customers were\r\nin the place.  Pete was twisting his napkined fist slowly in a beer\r\nglass, softly whistling to himself and occasionally holding the object\r\nof his attention between his eyes and a few weak beams of sunlight that\r\nhad found their way over the thick screens and into the shaded room.\r\n\r\nWith lingering thoughts of the woman of brilliance and audacity, the\r\nbartender raised his head and stared through the varying cracks between\r\nthe swaying bamboo doors.  Suddenly the whistling pucker faded from his\r\nlips.  He saw Maggie walking slowly past.  He gave a great start,\r\nfearing for the previously-mentioned eminent respectability of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHe threw a swift, nervous glance about him, all at once feeling guilty.\r\nNo one was in the room.\r\n\r\nHe went hastily over to the side door.  Opening it and looking out, he\r\nperceived Maggie standing, as if undecided, on the corner.  She was\r\nsearching the place with her eyes.\r\n\r\nAs she turned her face toward him Pete beckoned to her hurriedly,\r\nintent upon returning with speed to a position behind the bar and to\r\nthe atmosphere of respectability upon which the proprietor insisted.\r\n\r\nMaggie came to him, the anxious look disappearing from her face and a\r\nsmile wreathing her lips.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pete--," she began brightly.\r\n\r\nThe bartender made a violent gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Gawd," cried he, vehemently.  "What deh hell do yeh wanna hang\r\naroun\' here fer?  Do yeh wanna git me inteh trouble?" he demanded with\r\nan air of injury.\r\n\r\nAstonishment swept over the girl\'s features.  "Why, Pete! yehs tol\'\r\nme--"\r\n\r\nPete glanced profound irritation.  His countenance reddened with the\r\nanger of a man whose respectability is being threatened.\r\n\r\n"Say, yehs makes me tired.  See?  What deh hell deh yeh wanna tag\r\naroun\' atter me fer?  Yeh\'ll git me inteh trouble wid deh ol\' man an\'\r\ndey\'ll be hell teh pay!  If he sees a woman roun\' here he\'ll go crazy\r\nan\' I\'ll lose me job!  See?  Yer brudder come in here an\' raised hell\r\nan\' deh ol\' man hada put up fer it!  An\' now I\'m done!  See?  I\'m done."\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s eyes stared into his face.  "Pete, don\'t yeh remem--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell," interrupted Pete, anticipating.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to have a struggle with herself.  She was apparently\r\nbewildered and could not find speech.  Finally she asked in a low\r\nvoice: "But where kin I go?"\r\n\r\nThe question exasperated Pete beyond the powers of endurance.  It was a\r\ndirect attempt to give him some responsibility in a matter that did not\r\nconcern him.  In his indignation he volunteered information.\r\n\r\n"Oh, go teh hell," cried he.  He slammed the door furiously and\r\nreturned, with an air of relief, to his respectability.\r\n\r\nMaggie went away.\r\n\r\nShe wandered aimlessly for several blocks.  She stopped once and asked\r\naloud a question of herself: "Who?"\r\n\r\nA man who was passing near her shoulder, humorously took the\r\nquestioning word as intended for him.\r\n\r\n"Eh?  What?  Who?  Nobody!  I didn\'t say anything," he laughingly said,\r\nand continued his way.\r\n\r\nSoon the girl discovered that if she walked with such apparent\r\naimlessness, some men looked at her with calculating eyes.  She\r\nquickened her step, frightened.  As a protection, she adopted a\r\ndemeanor of intentness as if going somewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she left rattling avenues and passed between rows of\r\nhouses with sternness and stolidity stamped upon their features.  She\r\nhung her head for she felt their eyes grimly upon her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she came upon a stout gentleman in a silk hat and a chaste\r\nblack coat, whose decorous row of buttons reached from his chin to his\r\nknees.  The girl had heard of the Grace of God and she decided to\r\napproach this man.\r\n\r\nHis beaming, chubby face was a picture of benevolence and\r\nkind-heartedness.  His eyes shone good-will.\r\n\r\nBut as the girl timidly accosted him, he gave a convulsive movement and\r\nsaved his respectability by a vigorous side-step.  He did not risk it\r\nto save a soul.  For how was he to know that there was a soul before\r\nhim that needed saving?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\nUpon a wet evening, several months after the last chapter, two\r\ninterminable rows of cars, pulled by slipping horses, jangled along a\r\nprominent side-street.  A dozen cabs, with coat-enshrouded drivers,\r\nclattered to and fro.  Electric lights, whirring softly, shed a blurred\r\nradiance.  A flower dealer, his feet tapping impatiently, his nose and\r\nhis wares glistening with rain-drops, stood behind an array of roses\r\nand chrysanthemums.  Two or three theatres emptied a crowd upon the\r\nstorm-swept pavements.  Men pulled their hats over their eyebrows and\r\nraised their collars to their ears.  Women shrugged impatient shoulders\r\nin their warm cloaks and stopped to arrange their skirts for a walk\r\nthrough the storm.  People having been comparatively silent for two\r\nhours burst into a roar of conversation, their hearts still kindling\r\nfrom the glowings of the stage.\r\n\r\nThe pavements became tossing seas of umbrellas.  Men stepped forth to\r\nhail cabs or cars, raising their fingers in varied forms of polite\r\nrequest or imperative demand.  An endless procession wended toward\r\nelevated stations.  An atmosphere of pleasure and prosperity seemed to\r\nhang over the throng, born, perhaps, of good clothes and of having just\r\nemerged from a place of forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nIn the mingled light and gloom of an adjacent park, a handful of wet\r\nwanderers, in attitudes of chronic dejection, was scattered among the\r\nbenches.\r\n\r\nA girl of the painted cohorts of the city went along the street.  She\r\nthrew changing glances at men who passed her, giving smiling\r\ninvitations to men of rural or untaught pattern and usually seeming\r\nsedately unconscious of the men with a metropolitan seal upon their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nCrossing glittering avenues, she went into the throng emerging from the\r\nplaces of forgetfulness.  She hurried forward through the crowd as if\r\nintent upon reaching a distant home, bending forward in her handsome\r\ncloak, daintily lifting her skirts and picking for her well-shod feet\r\nthe dryer spots upon the pavements.\r\n\r\nThe restless doors of saloons, clashing to and fro, disclosed animated\r\nrows of men before bars and hurrying barkeepers.\r\n\r\nA concert hall gave to the street faint sounds of swift, machine-like\r\nmusic, as if a group of phantom musicians were hastening.\r\n\r\nA tall young man, smoking a cigarette with a sublime air, strolled near\r\nthe girl.  He had on evening dress, a moustache, a chrysanthemum, and a\r\nlook of ennui, all of which he kept carefully under his eye.  Seeing\r\nthe girl walk on as if such a young man as he was not in existence, he\r\nlooked back transfixed with interest.  He stared glassily for a moment,\r\nbut gave a slight convulsive start when he discerned that she was\r\nneither new, Parisian, nor theatrical.  He wheeled about hastily and\r\nturned his stare into the air, like a sailor with a search-light.\r\n\r\nA stout gentleman, with pompous and philanthropic whiskers, went\r\nstolidly by, the broad of his back sneering at the girl.\r\n\r\nA belated man in business clothes, and in haste to catch a car, bounced\r\nagainst her shoulder.  "Hi, there, Mary, I beg your pardon!  Brace up,\r\nold girl."  He grasped her arm to steady her, and then was away running\r\ndown the middle of the street.\r\n\r\nThe girl walked on out of the realm of restaurants and saloons.  She\r\npassed more glittering avenues and went into darker blocks than those\r\nwhere the crowd travelled.\r\n\r\nA young man in light overcoat and derby hat received a glance shot\r\nkeenly from the eyes of the girl.  He stopped and looked at her,\r\nthrusting his hands in his pockets and making a mocking smile curl his\r\nlips.  "Come, now, old lady," he said, "you don\'t mean to tel me that\r\nyou sized me up for a farmer?"\r\n\r\nA labouring man marched along; with bundles under his arms. To her\r\nremarks, he replied, "It\'s a fine evenin\', ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled squarely into the face of a boy who was hurrying by with his\r\nhands buried in his overcoat pockets, his blonde locks bobbing on his\r\nyouthful temples, and a cheery smile of unconcern upon his lips. He\r\nturned his head and smiled back at her, waving his hands.\r\n\r\n"Not this eve--some other eve!"\r\n\r\nA drunken man, reeling in her pathway, began to roar at her. "I ain\' ga\r\nno money!" he shouted, in a dismal voice. He lurched on up the street,\r\nwailing to himself: "I ain\' ga no money. Ba\' luck. Ain\' ga no more\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\nThe girl went into gloomy districts near the river, where the tall\r\nblack factories shut in the street and only occasional broad beams of\r\nlight fell across the pavements from saloons. In front of one of these\r\nplaces, whence came the sound of a violin vigorously scraped, the\r\npatter of feet on boards and the ring of loud laughter, there stood a\r\nman with blotched features.\r\n\r\nFurther on in the darkness she met a ragged being with shifting,\r\nbloodshot eyes and grimy hands.\r\n\r\nShe went into the blackness of the final block. The shutters of the\r\ntall buildings were closed like grim lips. The structures seemed to\r\nhave eyes that looked over them, beyond them, at other things. Afar off\r\nthe lights of the avenues glittered as if from an impossible distance.\r\nStreet-car bells jingled with a sound of merriment.\r\n\r\nAt the feet of the tall buildings appeared the deathly black hue of the\r\nriver. Some hidden factory sent up a yellow glare, that lit for a\r\nmoment the waters lapping oilily against timbers. The varied sounds of\r\nlife, made joyous by distance and seeming unapproachableness, came\r\nfaintly and died away to a silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nIn a partitioned-off section of a saloon sat a man with a half dozen\r\nwomen, gleefully laughing, hovering about him.  The man had arrived at\r\nthat stage of drunkenness where affection is felt for the universe.\r\n\r\n"I\'m good f\'ler, girls," he said, convincingly.  "I\'m damn good f\'ler.\r\nAn\'body treats me right, I allus trea\'s zem right!  See?"\r\n\r\nThe women nodded their heads approvingly.  "To be sure," they cried out\r\nin hearty chorus.  "You\'re the kind of a man we like, Pete.  You\'re\r\nouta sight!  What yeh goin\' to buy this time, dear?"\r\n\r\n"An\'t\'ing yehs wants, damn it," said the man in an abandonment of good\r\nwill.  His countenance shone with the true spirit of benevolence.  He\r\nwas in the proper mode of missionaries.  He would have fraternized with\r\nobscure Hottentots.  And above all, he was overwhelmed in tenderness\r\nfor his friends, who were all illustrious.\r\n\r\n"An\'t\'ing yehs wants, damn it," repeated he, waving his hands with\r\nbeneficent recklessness.  "I\'m good f\'ler, girls, an\' if an\'body treats\r\nme right I--here," called he through an open door to a waiter, "bring\r\ngirls drinks, damn it.  What \'ill yehs have, girls?  An\'t\'ing yehs\r\nwants, damn it!"\r\n\r\nThe waiter glanced in with the disgusted look of the man who serves\r\nintoxicants for the man who takes too much of them.  He nodded his head\r\nshortly at the order from each individual, and went.\r\n\r\n"Damn it," said the man, "we\'re havin\' heluva time.  I like you girls!\r\nDamn\'d if I don\'t!  Yer right sort!  See?"\r\n\r\nHe spoke at length and with feeling, concerning the excellencies of his\r\nassembled friends.\r\n\r\n"Don\' try pull man\'s leg, but have a heluva time!  Das right!  Das way\r\nteh do!  Now, if I sawght yehs tryin\' work me fer drinks, wouldn\' buy\r\ndamn t\'ing!  But yer right sort, damn it!  Yehs know how ter treat a\r\nf\'ler, an\' I stays by yehs \'til spen\' las\' cent!  Das right!  I\'m good\r\nf\'ler an\' I knows when an\'body treats me right!"\r\n\r\nBetween the times of the arrival and departure of the waiter, the man\r\ndiscoursed to the women on the tender regard he felt for all living\r\nthings.  He laid stress upon the purity of his motives in all dealings\r\nwith men in the world and spoke of the fervor of his friendship for\r\nthose who were amiable.  Tears welled slowly from his eyes.  His voice\r\nquavered when he spoke to them.\r\n\r\nOnce when the waiter was about to depart with an empty tray, the man\r\ndrew a coin from his pocket and held it forth.\r\n\r\n"Here," said he, quite magnificently, "here\'s quar\'."\r\n\r\nThe waiter kept his hands on his tray.\r\n\r\n"I don\' want yer money," he said.\r\n\r\nThe other put forth the coin with tearful insistence.\r\n\r\n"Here, damn it," cried he, "tak\'t!  Yer damn goo\' f\'ler an\' I wan\' yehs\r\ntak\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, now," said the waiter, with the sullen air of a man who is\r\nforced into giving advice.  "Put yer mon in yer pocket!  Yer loaded an\'\r\nyehs on\'y makes a damn fool of yerself."\r\n\r\nAs the latter passed out of the door the man turned pathetically to the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n"He don\' know I\'m damn goo\' f\'ler," cried he, dismally.\r\n\r\n"Never you mind, Pete, dear," said a woman of brilliance and audacity,\r\nlaying her hand with great affection upon his arm.  "Never you mind,\r\nold boy!  We\'ll stay by you, dear!"\r\n\r\n"Das ri\'," cried the man, his face lighting up at the soothing tones of\r\nthe woman\'s voice.  "Das ri\', I\'m damn goo\' f\'ler an\' w\'en anyone\r\ntrea\'s me ri\', I treats zem ri\'!  Shee!"\r\n\r\n"Sure!" cried the women.  "And we\'re not goin\' back on you, old man."\r\n\r\nThe man turned appealing eyes to the woman of brilliance and audacity.\r\nHe felt that if he could be convicted of a contemptible action he would\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n"Shay, Nell, damn it, I allus trea\'s yehs shquare, didn\' I?  I allus\r\nbeen goo\' f\'ler wi\' yehs, ain\'t I, Nell?"\r\n\r\n"Sure you have, Pete," assented the woman.  She delivered an oration to\r\nher companions.  "Yessir, that\'s a fact.  Pete\'s a square fellah, he\r\nis.  He never goes back on a friend.  He\'s the right kind an\' we stay\r\nby him, don\'t we, girls?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," they exclaimed.  Looking lovingly at him they raised their\r\nglasses and drank his health.\r\n\r\n"Girlsh," said the man, beseechingly, "I allus trea\'s yehs ri\', didn\'\r\nI?  I\'m goo\' f\'ler, ain\' I, girlsh?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," again they chorused.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he finally, "le\'s have nozzer drink, zen."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," hailed a woman, "that\'s right.  Yer no bloomin\' jay!\r\nYer spends yer money like a man.  Dat\'s right."\r\n\r\nThe man pounded the table with his quivering fists.\r\n\r\n"Yessir," he cried, with deep earnestness, as if someone disputed him.\r\n"I\'m damn goo\' f\'ler, an\' w\'en anyone trea\'s me ri\', I allus\r\ntrea\'s--le\'s have nozzer drink."\r\n\r\nHe began to beat the wood with his glass.\r\n\r\n"Shay," howled he, growing suddenly impatient.  As the waiter did not\r\nthen come, the man swelled with wrath.\r\n\r\n"Shay," howled he again.\r\n\r\nThe waiter appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n"Bringsh drinksh," said the man.\r\n\r\nThe waiter disappeared with the orders.\r\n\r\n"Zat f\'ler damn fool," cried the man.  "He insul\' me!  I\'m ge\'man!\r\nCan\' stan\' be insul\'!  I\'m goin\' lickim when comes!"\r\n\r\n"No, no," cried the women, crowding about and trying to subdue him.\r\n"He\'s all right!  He didn\'t mean anything!  Let it go!  He\'s a good\r\nfellah!"\r\n\r\n"Din\' he insul\' me?" asked the man earnestly.\r\n\r\n"No," said they.  "Of course he didn\'t!  He\'s all right!"\r\n\r\n"Sure he didn\' insul\' me?" demanded the man, with deep anxiety in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"No, no!  We know him!  He\'s a good fellah.  He didn\'t mean anything."\r\n\r\n"Well, zen," said the man, resolutely, "I\'m go\' \'pol\'gize!"\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter came, the man struggled to the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\n"Girlsh shed you insul\' me!  I shay damn lie!  I \'pol\'gize!"\r\n\r\n"All right," said the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe man sat down.  He felt a sleepy but strong desire to straighten\r\nthings out and have a perfect understanding with everybody.\r\n\r\n"Nell, I allus trea\'s yeh shquare, din\' I?  Yeh likes me, don\' yehs,\r\nNell?  I\'m goo\' f\'ler?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," said the woman of brilliance and audacity.\r\n\r\n"Yeh knows I\'m stuck on yehs, don\' yehs, Nell?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," she repeated, carelessly.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed by a spasm of drunken adoration, he drew two or three bills\r\nfrom his pocket, and, with the trembling fingers of an offering priest,\r\nlaid them on the table before the woman.\r\n\r\n"Yehs knows, damn it, yehs kin have all got, \'cause I\'m stuck on yehs,\r\nNell, damn\'t, I--I\'m stuck on yehs, Nell--buy drinksh--damn\'t--we\'re\r\nhavin\' heluva time--w\'en anyone trea\'s me ri\'--I--damn\'t, Nell--we\'re\r\nhavin\' heluva--time."\r\n\r\nShortly he went to sleep with his swollen face fallen forward on his\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nThe women drank and laughed, not heeding the slumbering man in the\r\ncorner.  Finally he lurched forward and fell groaning to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe women screamed in disgust and drew back their skirts.\r\n\r\n"Come ahn," cried one, starting up angrily, "let\'s get out of here."\r\n\r\nThe woman of brilliance and audacity stayed behind, taking up the bills\r\nand stuffing them into a deep, irregularly-shaped pocket.  A guttural\r\nsnore from the recumbent man caused her to turn and look down at him.\r\n\r\nShe laughed.  "What a damn fool," she said, and went.\r\n\r\nThe smoke from the lamps settled heavily down in the little\r\ncompartment, obscuring the way out.  The smell of oil, stifling in its\r\nintensity, pervaded the air.  The wine from an overturned glass dripped\r\nsoftly down upon the blotches on the man\'s neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\nIn a room a woman sat at a table eating like a fat monk in a picture.\r\n\r\nA soiled, unshaven man pushed open the door and entered.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, "Mag\'s dead."\r\n\r\n"What?" said the woman, her mouth filled with bread.\r\n\r\n"Mag\'s dead," repeated the man.\r\n\r\n"Deh hell she is," said the woman.  She continued her meal.  When she\r\nfinished her coffee she began to weep.\r\n\r\n"I kin remember when her two feet was no bigger dan yer t\'umb, and she\r\nweared worsted boots," moaned she.\r\n\r\n"Well, whata dat?" said the man.\r\n\r\n"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots," she cried.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors began to gather in the hall, staring in at the weeping\r\nwoman as if watching the contortions of a dying dog.  A dozen women\r\nentered and lamented with her.  Under their busy hands the rooms took\r\non that appalling appearance of neatness and order with which death is\r\ngreeted.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened and a woman in a black gown rushed in with\r\noutstretched arms.  "Ah, poor Mary," she cried, and tenderly embraced\r\nthe moaning one.\r\n\r\n"Ah, what ter\'ble affliction is dis," continued she.  Her vocabulary\r\nwas derived from mission churches.  "Me poor Mary, how I feel fer yehs!\r\nAh, what a ter\'ble affliction is a disobed\'ent chil\'."\r\n\r\nHer good, motherly face was wet with tears.  She trembled in eagerness\r\nto express her sympathy.  The mourner sat with bowed head, rocking her\r\nbody heavily to and fro, and crying out in a high, strained voice that\r\nsounded like a dirge on some forlorn pipe.\r\n\r\n"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots an\' her two feets was no\r\nbigger dan yer t\'umb an\' she weared worsted boots, Miss Smith," she\r\ncried, raising her streaming eyes.\r\n\r\n"Ah, me poor Mary," sobbed the woman in black.  With low, coddling\r\ncries, she sank on her knees by the mourner\'s chair, and put her arms\r\nabout her.  The other women began to groan in different keys.\r\n\r\n"Yer poor misguided chil\' is gone now, Mary, an\' let us hope it\'s fer\r\ndeh bes\'.  Yeh\'ll fergive her now, Mary, won\'t yehs, dear, all her\r\ndisobed\'ence?  All her t\'ankless behavior to her mudder an\' all her\r\nbadness?  She\'s gone where her ter\'ble sins will be judged."\r\n\r\nThe woman in black raised her face and paused.  The inevitable sunlight\r\ncame streaming in at the windows and shed a ghastly cheerfulness upon\r\nthe faded hues of the room.  Two or three of the spectators were\r\nsniffling, and one was loudly weeping.  The mourner arose and staggered\r\ninto the other room.  In a moment she emerged with a pair of faded baby\r\nshoes held in the hollow of her hand.\r\n\r\n"I kin remember when she used to wear dem," cried she.  The women burst\r\nanew into cries as if they had all been stabbed.  The mourner turned to\r\nthe soiled and unshaven man.\r\n\r\n"Jimmie, boy, go git yer sister!  Go git yer sister an\' we\'ll put deh\r\nboots on her feets!"\r\n\r\n"Dey won\'t fit her now, yeh damn fool," said the man.\r\n\r\n"Go git yer sister, Jimmie," shrieked the woman, confronting him\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\nThe man swore sullenly.  He went over to a corner and slowly began to\r\nput on his coat.  He took his hat and went out, with a dragging,\r\nreluctant step.\r\n\r\nThe woman in black came forward and again besought the mourner.\r\n\r\n"Yeh\'ll fergive her, Mary!  Yeh\'ll fergive yer bad, bad, chil\'!  Her\r\nlife was a curse an\' her days were black an\' yeh\'ll fergive yer bad\r\ngirl?  She\'s gone where her sins will be judged."\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone where her sins will be judged," cried the other women, like\r\na choir at a funeral.\r\n\r\n"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," said the woman in black,\r\nraising her eyes to the sunbeams.\r\n\r\n"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," responded the others.\r\n\r\n"Yeh\'ll fergive her, Mary!" pleaded the woman in black.  The mourner\r\nessayed to speak but her voice gave way.  She shook her great shoulders\r\nfrantically, in an agony of grief.  Hot tears seemed to scald her\r\nquivering face.  Finally her voice came and arose like a scream of pain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I\'ll fergive her!  I\'ll fergive her!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, by Stephen Crane\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MAGGIE: A GIRL OF THE STREETS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 447.txt or 447.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/4/4/447/\r\n\r\nProduced by Judith Boss.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
