The man\xe2\x80\x99s hands were behind his\r\nback, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck.\r\nIt was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack\r\nfell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the ties\r\nsupporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him and his\r\nexecutioners\xe2\x80\x94two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a\r\nsergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short\r\nremove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform\r\nof his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the\r\nbridge stood with his rifle in the position known as \xe2\x80\x9csupport,\xe2\x80\x9d that is\r\nto say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on\r\nthe forearm thrown straight across the chest\xe2\x80\x94a formal and unnatural\r\nposition, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to\r\nbe the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center\r\nof the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking\r\nthat traversed it.\r\n\r\nBeyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\r\nstraight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was\r\nlost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other\r\nbank of the stream was open ground\xe2\x80\x94a gentle slope topped with a\r\nstockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single\r\nembrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon\r\ncommanding the bridge. Midway up the slope between the bridge and fort\r\nwere the spectators\xe2\x80\x94a single company of infantry in line, at \xe2\x80\x9cparade\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x9d the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining\r\nslightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon\r\nthe stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of\r\nhis sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right.\r\nExcepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man\r\nmoved. The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The\r\nsentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to\r\nadorn the bridge. The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing\r\nthe work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary\r\nwho when he comes announced is to be received with formal\r\nmanifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the\r\ncode of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.\r\n\r\nThe man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about\r\nthirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from\r\nhis habit, which was that of a planter. His features were good\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nstraight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark\r\nhair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of\r\nhis well fitting frock coat. He wore a moustache and pointed beard, but\r\nno whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly\r\nexpression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was\r\nin the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal\r\nmilitary code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and\r\ngentlemen are not excluded.\r\n\r\nThe preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside\r\nand each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The\r\nsergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately\r\nbehind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements\r\nleft the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the\r\nsame plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The\r\nend upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a\r\nfourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain;\r\nit was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former\r\nthe latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man\r\ngo down between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his\r\njudgement as simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor\r\nhis eyes bandaged. He looked a moment at his \xe2\x80\x9cunsteadfast footing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthen let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing\r\nmadly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his\r\nattention and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it\r\nappeared to move! What a sluggish stream!\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and\r\nchildren. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding\r\nmists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the\r\nsoldiers, the piece of drift\xe2\x80\x94all had distracted him. And now he became\r\nconscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his\r\ndear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a\r\nsharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered\r\nwhat it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by\xe2\x80\x94 it seemed\r\nboth. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death\r\nknell. He awaited each new stroke with impatience and\xe2\x80\x94he knew not\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94apprehension. The intervals of silence grew progressively longer;\r\nthe delays became maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds\r\nincreased in strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust\r\nof a knife; he feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\nHe unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could\r\nfree my hands,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI might throw off the noose and spring\r\ninto the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming\r\nvigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My\r\nhome, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones\r\nare still beyond the invader\xe2\x80\x99s farthest advance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were\r\nflashed into the doomed man\xe2\x80\x99s brain rather than evolved from it the\r\ncaptain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nPeyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly\r\nrespected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave\r\nowners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and\r\nardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious\r\nnature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from\r\ntaking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous\r\ncampaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the\r\ninglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the\r\nlarger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That\r\nopportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in wartime.\r\nMeanwhile he did what he could. No service was too humble for him to\r\nperform in the aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to\r\nundertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at\r\nheart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much\r\nqualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous\r\ndictum that all is fair in love and war.\r\n\r\nOne evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench\r\nnear the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the\r\ngate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy\r\nto serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water\r\nher husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news\r\nfrom the front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Yanks are repairing the railroads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cand are getting\r\nready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put\r\nit in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has\r\nissued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any\r\ncivilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or\r\ntrains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\xe2\x80\x9d Farquhar asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout thirty miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no force on this side of the creek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single\r\nsentinel at this end of the bridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose a man\xe2\x80\x94a civilian and student of hanging\xe2\x80\x94should elude the\r\npicket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farquhar,\r\nsmiling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat could he accomplish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cI was there a month ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nobserved that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of\r\ndriftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now\r\ndry and would burn like tinder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked\r\nher ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later,\r\nafter nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the\r\ndirection from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost\r\nconsciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was\r\nawakened\xe2\x80\x94ages later, it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94by the pain of a sharp pressure\r\nupon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant\r\nagonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of\r\nhis body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well defined\r\nlines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid\r\nperiodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to\r\nan intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing\r\nbut a feeling of fullness\xe2\x80\x94of congestion. These sensations were\r\nunaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was\r\nalready effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He\r\nwas conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he\r\nwas now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung\r\nthrough unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all\r\nat once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with\r\nthe noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and\r\nall was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that\r\nthe rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no\r\nadditional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already\r\nsuffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at\r\nthe bottom of a river!\xe2\x80\x94the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his\r\neyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how\r\ndistant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became\r\nfainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow\r\nand brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface\xe2\x80\x94knew it\r\nwith reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be hanged and\r\ndrowned,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is not so bad; but I do not wish to be\r\nshot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist\r\napprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle\r\nhis attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without\r\ninterest in the outcome. What splendid effort!\xe2\x80\x94what magnificent, what\r\nsuperhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell\r\naway; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each\r\nside in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first\r\none and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it\r\naway and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of\r\na water snake. \xe2\x80\x9cPut it back, put it back!\xe2\x80\x9d He thought he shouted these\r\nwords to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by\r\nthe direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly;\r\nhis brain was on fire, his heart, which had been fluttering faintly,\r\ngave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole\r\nbody was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his\r\ndisobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water\r\nvigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He\r\nfelt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest\r\nexpanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs\r\nengulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a\r\nshriek!\r\n\r\nHe was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were,\r\nindeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful\r\ndisturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that\r\nthey made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples\r\nupon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked\r\nat the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the\r\nleaves and the veining of each leaf\xe2\x80\x94he saw the very insects upon them:\r\nthe locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching\r\ntheir webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the\r\ndewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that\r\ndanced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwings, the strokes of the water spiders\xe2\x80\x99 legs, like oars which had\r\nlifted their boat\xe2\x80\x94all these made audible music. A fish slid along\r\nbeneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.\r\n\r\nHe had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\r\nvisible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,\r\nand he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the\r\ncaptain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in\r\nsilhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated,\r\npointing at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire;\r\nthe others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible,\r\ntheir forms gigantic.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly\r\nwithin a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He\r\nheard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at\r\nhis shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The\r\nman in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his\r\nown through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a gray eye\r\nand remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all\r\nfamous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.\r\n\r\nA counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was\r\nagain looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of\r\na clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him\r\nand came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued\r\nall other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although\r\nno soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread\r\nsignificance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the\r\nlieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning\xe2\x80\x99s work. How coldly\r\nand pitilessly\xe2\x80\x94with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and\r\nenforcing tranquility in the men\xe2\x80\x94with what accurately measured interval\r\nfell those cruel words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompany!\xe2\x80\xa6 Attention!\xe2\x80\xa6 Shoulder arms!\xe2\x80\xa6 Ready!\xe2\x80\xa6 Aim!\xe2\x80\xa6 Fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarquhar dived\xe2\x80\x94dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his\r\nears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the\r\nvolley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal,\r\nsingularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched\r\nhim on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent.\r\nOne lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and\r\nhe snatched it out.\r\n\r\nAs he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been\r\na long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream\xe2\x80\x94nearer\r\nto safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal\r\nramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the\r\nbarrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two\r\nsentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.\r\n\r\nThe hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming\r\nvigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and\r\nlegs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe officer,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cwill not make that martinet\xe2\x80\x99s error a\r\nsecond time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has\r\nprobably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I\r\ncannot dodge them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud,\r\nrushing sound, DIMINUENDO, which seemed to travel back through the air\r\nto the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to\r\nits deeps! A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him,\r\nblinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken an hand in the game.\r\nAs he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he\r\nheard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an\r\ninstant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not do that again,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cthe next time they will use\r\na charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will\r\napprise me\xe2\x80\x94the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile.\r\nThat is a good gun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt himself whirled round and round\xe2\x80\x94spinning like a top.\r\nThe water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and\r\nmen, all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their\r\ncolors only; circular horizontal streaks of color\xe2\x80\x94that was all he saw.\r\nHe had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity\r\nof advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In few moments he\r\nwas flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the\r\nstream\xe2\x80\x94the southern bank\xe2\x80\x94and behind a projecting point which concealed\r\nhim from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of\r\none of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight.\r\nHe dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and\r\naudibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could\r\nthink of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon\r\nthe bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their\r\narrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange roseate\r\nlight shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in\r\ntheir branches the music of AEolian harps. He had not wish to perfect\r\nhis escape\xe2\x80\x94he was content to remain in that enchanting spot until\r\nretaken.\r\n\r\nA whiz and a rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head\r\nroused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random\r\nfarewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and\r\nplunged into the forest.\r\n\r\nAll that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The\r\nforest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not\r\neven a woodman\xe2\x80\x99s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a\r\nregion. There was something uncanny in the revelation.\r\n\r\nBy nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished. The thought of his\r\nwife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him\r\nin what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight\r\nas a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no\r\ndwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human\r\nhabitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on\r\nboth sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a\r\nlesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in\r\nthe wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in\r\nstrange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order\r\nwhich had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was\r\nfull of singular noises, among which\xe2\x80\x94once, twice, and again\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ndistinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.\r\n\r\nHis neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly\r\nswollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had\r\nbruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His\r\ntongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it\r\nforward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf\r\nhad carpeted the untraveled avenue\xe2\x80\x94he could no longer feel the roadway\r\nbeneath his feet!\r\n\r\nDoubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking,\r\nfor now he sees another scene\xe2\x80\x94perhaps he has merely recovered from a\r\ndelirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it,\r\nand all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have\r\ntraveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the\r\nwide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife,\r\nlooking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet\r\nhim. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of\r\nineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how\r\nbeautiful she is! He springs forwards with extended arms. As he is\r\nabout to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck;\r\na blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock\r\nof a cannon\xe2\x80\x94then all is darkness and silence!\r\n\r\nPeyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently\r\nfrom side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
