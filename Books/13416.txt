It was hot, the\r\nflies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect\r\nthat it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from\r\nthe east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nKukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli,\r\nand who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden\r\nlooking at the sky.\r\n\r\n"Again!" he observed despairingly. "It\'s going to rain again! Rain\r\nevery day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It\'s\r\nruin! Fearful losses every day."\r\n\r\nHe flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:\r\n\r\n"There! that\'s the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It\'s enough to\r\nmake one cry. One works and does one\'s utmost, one wears oneself\r\nout, getting no sleep at night, and racks one\'s brain what to do\r\nfor the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one\'s public\r\nis ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty\r\nmasque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that\'s\r\nwhat they want! They don\'t understand anything of that sort. They\r\nwant a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the\r\nweather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of\r\nMay, and it\'s kept it up all May and June. It\'s simply awful! The\r\npublic doesn\'t come, but I\'ve to pay the rent just the same, and\r\npay the artists."\r\n\r\nThe next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say\r\nwith an hysterical laugh:\r\n\r\n"Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck\r\nin this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to\r\nprison!--to Siberia!--the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nAnd next day the same thing.\r\n\r\nOlenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears\r\ncame into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she\r\ngrew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and\r\ncurls combed forward on his forehead. He spoke in a thin tenor; as\r\nhe talked his mouth worked on one side, and there was always an\r\nexpression of despair on his face; yet he aroused a deep and genuine\r\naffection in her. She was always fond of some one, and could not\r\nexist without loving. In earlier days she had loved her papa, who\r\nnow sat in a darkened room, breathing with difficulty; she had loved\r\nher aunt who used to come every other year from Bryansk; and before\r\nthat, when she was at school, she had loved her French master. She\r\nwas a gentle, soft-hearted, compassionate girl, with mild, tender\r\neyes and very good health. At the sight of her full rosy cheeks,\r\nher soft white neck with a little dark mole on it, and the kind,\r\nna\xefve smile, which came into her face when she listened to anything\r\npleasant, men thought, "Yes, not half bad," and smiled too, while\r\nlady visitors could not refrain from seizing her hand in the middle\r\nof a conversation, exclaiming in a gush of delight, "You darling!"\r\n\r\nThe house in which she had lived from her birth upwards, and which\r\nwas left her in her father\'s will, was at the extreme end of the\r\ntown, not far from the Tivoli. In the evenings and at night she\r\ncould head the band playing, and the crackling and banging of\r\nfireworks, and it seemed to her that it was Kukin struggling with\r\nhis destiny, storming the entrenchments of his chief foe, the\r\nindifferent public; there was a sweet thrill at her heart, she had\r\nno desire to sleep, and when he returned home at day-break, she\r\ntapped softly at her bedroom window, and showing him only her face\r\nand one shoulder through the curtain, she gave him a friendly\r\nsmile. . . .\r\n\r\nHe proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a closer\r\nview of her neck and her plump, fine shoulders, he threw up his\r\nhands, and said:\r\n\r\n"You darling!"\r\n\r\nHe was happy, but as it rained on the day and night of his wedding,\r\nhis face still retained an expression of despair.\r\n\r\nThey got on very well together. She used to sit in his office, to\r\nlook after things in the Tivoli, to put down the accounts and pay\r\nthe wages. And her rosy cheeks, her sweet, na\xefve, radiant smile,\r\nwere to be seen now at the office window, now in the refreshment\r\nbar or behind the scenes of the theatre. And already she used to\r\nsay to her acquaintances that the theatre was the chief and most\r\nimportant thing in life and that it was only through the drama that\r\none could derive true enjoyment and become cultivated and humane.\r\n\r\n"But do you suppose the public understands that?" she used to say.\r\n"What they want is a clown. Yesterday we gave \'Faust Inside Out,\'\r\nand almost all the boxes were empty; but if Vanitchka and I had\r\nbeen producing some vulgar thing, I assure you the theatre would\r\nhave been packed. Tomorrow Vanitchka and I are doing \'Orpheus in\r\nHell.\' Do come."\r\n\r\nAnd what Kukin said about the theatre and the actors she repeated.\r\nLike him she despised the public for their ignorance and their\r\nindifference to art; she took part in the rehearsals, she corrected\r\nthe actors, she kept an eye on the behaviour of the musicians, and\r\nwhen there was an unfavourable notice in the local paper, she shed\r\ntears, and then went to the editor\'s office to set things right.\r\n\r\nThe actors were fond of her and used to call her "Vanitchka and I,"\r\nand "the darling"; she was sorry for them and used to lend them\r\nsmall sums of money, and if they deceived her, she used to shed a\r\nfew tears in private, but did not complain to her husband.\r\n\r\nThey got on well in the winter too. They took the theatre in the\r\ntown for the whole winter, and let it for short terms to a Little\r\nRussian company, or to a conjurer, or to a local dramatic society.\r\nOlenka grew stouter, and was always beaming with satisfaction, while\r\nKukin grew thinner and yellower, and continually complained of their\r\nterrible losses, although he had not done badly all the winter. He\r\nused to cough at night, and she used to give him hot raspberry tea\r\nor lime-flower water, to rub him with eau-de-Cologne and to wrap\r\nhim in her warm shawls.\r\n\r\n"You\'re such a sweet pet!" she used to say with perfect sincerity,\r\nstroking his hair. "You\'re such a pretty dear!"\r\n\r\nTowards Lent he went to Moscow to collect a new troupe, and without\r\nhim she could not sleep, but sat all night at her window, looking\r\nat the stars, and she compared herself with the hens, who are awake\r\nall night and uneasy when the cock is not in the hen-house. Kukin\r\nwas detained in Moscow, and wrote that he would be back at Easter,\r\nadding some instructions about the Tivoli. But on the Sunday before\r\nEaster, late in the evening, came a sudden ominous knock at the\r\ngate; some one was hammering on the gate as though on a barrel--\r\nboom, boom, boom! The drowsy cook went flopping with her bare feet\r\nthrough the puddles, as she ran to open the gate.\r\n\r\n"Please open," said some one outside in a thick bass. "There is a\r\ntelegram for you."\r\n\r\nOlenka had received telegrams from her husband before, but this\r\ntime for some reason she felt numb with terror. With shaking hands\r\nshe opened the telegram and read as follows:\r\n\r\n"IVAN PETROVITCH DIED SUDDENLY TO-DAY. AWAITING IMMATE INSTRUCTIONS\r\nFUFUNERAL TUESDAY."\r\n\r\nThat was how it was written in the telegram--"fufuneral," and the\r\nutterly incomprehensible word "immate." It was signed by the stage\r\nmanager of the operatic company.\r\n\r\n"My darling!" sobbed Olenka. "Vanka, my precious, my darling! Why\r\ndid I ever meet you! Why did I know you and love you! Your poor\r\nheart-broken Olenka is alone without you!"\r\n\r\nKukin\'s funeral took place on Tuesday in Moscow, Olenka returned\r\nhome on Wednesday, and as soon as she got indoors, she threw herself\r\non her bed and sobbed so loudly that it could be heard next door,\r\nand in the street.\r\n\r\n"Poor darling!" the neighbours said, as they crossed themselves.\r\n"Olga Semyonovna, poor darling! How she does take on!"\r\n\r\nThree months later Olenka was coming home from mass, melancholy and\r\nin deep mourning. It happened that one of her neighbours, Vassily\r\nAndreitch Pustovalov, returning home from church, walked back beside\r\nher. He was the manager at Babakayev\'s, the timber merchant\'s. He\r\nwore a straw hat, a white waistcoat, and a gold watch-chain, and\r\nlooked more a country gentleman than a man in trade.\r\n\r\n"Everything happens as it is ordained, Olga Semyonovna," he said\r\ngravely, with a sympathetic note in his voice; "and if any of our\r\ndear ones die, it must be because it is the will of God, so we ought\r\nhave fortitude and bear it submissively."\r\n\r\nAfter seeing Olenka to her gate, he said good-bye and went on. All\r\nday afterwards she heard his sedately dignified voice, and whenever\r\nshe shut her eyes she saw his dark beard. She liked him very much.\r\nAnd apparently she had made an impression on him too, for not long\r\nafterwards an elderly lady, with whom she was only slightly acquainted,\r\ncame to drink coffee with her, and as soon as she was seated at\r\ntable began to talk about Pustovalov, saying that he was an excellent\r\nman whom one could thoroughly depend upon, and that any girl would\r\nbe glad to marry him. Three days later Pustovalov came himself. He\r\ndid not stay long, only about ten minutes, and he did not say much,\r\nbut when he left, Olenka loved him--loved him so much that she\r\nlay awake all night in a perfect fever, and in the morning she sent\r\nfor the elderly lady. The match was quickly arranged, and then came\r\nthe wedding.\r\n\r\nPustovalov and Olenka got on very well together when they were\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nUsually he sat in the office till dinner-time, then he went out on\r\nbusiness, while Olenka took his place, and sat in the office till\r\nevening, making up accounts and booking orders.\r\n\r\n"Timber gets dearer every year; the price rises twenty per cent,"\r\nshe would say to her customers and friends. "Only fancy we used to\r\nsell local timber, and now Vassitchka always has to go for wood to\r\nthe Mogilev district. And the freight!" she would add, covering her\r\ncheeks with her hands in horror. "The freight!"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that she had been in the timber trade for ages and\r\nages, and that the most important and necessary thing in life was\r\ntimber; and there was something intimate and touching to her in the\r\nvery sound of words such as "baulk," "post," "beam," "pole,"\r\n"scantling," "batten," "lath," "plank," etc.\r\n\r\nAt night when she was asleep she dreamed of perfect mountains of\r\nplanks and boards, and long strings of wagons, carting timber\r\nsomewhere far away. She dreamed that a whole regiment of six-inch\r\nbeams forty feet high, standing on end, was marching upon the\r\ntimber-yard; that logs, beams, and boards knocked together with the\r\nresounding crash of dry wood, kept falling and getting up again,\r\npiling themselves on each other. Olenka cried out in her sleep, and\r\nPustovalov said to her tenderly: "Olenka, what\'s the matter, darling?\r\nCross yourself!"\r\n\r\nHer husband\'s ideas were hers. If he thought the room was too hot,\r\nor that business was slack, she thought the same. Her husband did\r\nnot care for entertainments, and on holidays he stayed at home. She\r\ndid likewise.\r\n\r\n"You are always at home or in the office," her friends said to her.\r\n"You should go to the theatre, darling, or to the circus."\r\n\r\n"Vassitchka and I have no time to go to theatres," she would answer\r\nsedately. "We have no time for nonsense. What\'s the use of these\r\ntheatres?"\r\n\r\nOn Saturdays Pustovalov and she used to go to the evening service;\r\non holidays to early mass, and they walked side by side with softened\r\nfaces as they came home from church. There was a pleasant fragrance\r\nabout them both, and her silk dress rustled agreeably. At home they\r\ndrank tea, with fancy bread and jams of various kinds, and afterwards\r\nthey ate pie. Every day at twelve o\'clock there was a savoury smell\r\nof beet-root soup and of mutton or duck in their yard, and on\r\nfast-days of fish, and no one could pass the gate without feeling\r\nhungry. In the office the samovar was always boiling, and customers\r\nwere regaled with tea and cracknels. Once a week the couple went\r\nto the baths and returned side by side, both red in the face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have nothing to complain of, thank God," Olenka used to\r\nsay to her acquaintances. "I wish every one were as well off as\r\nVassitchka and I."\r\n\r\nWhen Pustovalov went away to buy wood in the Mogilev district, she\r\nmissed him dreadfully, lay awake and cried. A young veterinary\r\nsurgeon in the army, called Smirnin, to whom they had let their\r\nlodge, used sometimes to come in in the evening. He used to talk\r\nto her and play cards with her, and this entertained her in her\r\nhusband\'s absence. She was particularly interested in what he told\r\nher of his home life. He was married and had a little boy, but was\r\nseparated from his wife because she had been unfaithful to him, and\r\nnow he hated her and used to send her forty roubles a month for the\r\nmaintenance of their son. And hearing of all this, Olenka sighed\r\nand shook her head. She was sorry for him.\r\n\r\n"Well, God keep you," she used to say to him at parting, as she\r\nlighted him down the stairs with a candle. "Thank you for coming\r\nto cheer me up, and may the Mother of God give you health."\r\n\r\nAnd she always expressed herself with the same sedateness and\r\ndignity, the same reasonableness, in imitation of her husband. As\r\nthe veterinary surgeon was disappearing behind the door below, she\r\nwould say:\r\n\r\n"You know, Vladimir Platonitch, you\'d better make it up with your\r\nwife. You should forgive her for the sake of your son. You may be\r\nsure the little fellow understands."\r\n\r\nAnd when Pustovalov came back, she told him in a low voice about\r\nthe veterinary surgeon and his unhappy home life, and both sighed\r\nand shook their heads and talked about the boy, who, no doubt,\r\nmissed his father, and by some strange connection of ideas, they\r\nwent up to the holy ikons, bowed to the ground before them and\r\nprayed that God would give them children.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Pustovalovs lived for six years quietly and peaceably\r\nin love and complete harmony.\r\n\r\nBut behold! one winter day after drinking hot tea in the office,\r\nVassily Andreitch went out into the yard without his cap on to see\r\nabout sending off some timber, caught cold and was taken ill. He\r\nhad the best doctors, but he grew worse and died after four months\'\r\nillness. And Olenka was a widow once more.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve nobody, now you\'ve left me, my darling," she sobbed, after\r\nher husband\'s funeral. "How can I live without you, in wretchedness\r\nand misery! Pity me, good people, all alone in the world!"\r\n\r\nShe went about dressed in black with long "weepers," and gave up\r\nwearing hat and gloves for good. She hardly ever went out, except\r\nto church, or to her husband\'s grave, and led the life of a nun.\r\nIt was not till six months later that she took off the weepers and\r\nopened the shutters of the windows. She was sometimes seen in the\r\nmornings, going with her cook to market for provisions, but what\r\nwent on in her house and how she lived now could only be surmised.\r\nPeople guessed, from seeing her drinking tea in her garden with the\r\nveterinary surgeon, who read the newspaper aloud to her, and from\r\nthe fact that, meeting a lady she knew at the post-office, she said\r\nto her:\r\n\r\n"There is no proper veterinary inspection in our town, and that\'s\r\nthe cause of all sorts of epidemics. One is always hearing of\r\npeople\'s getting infection from the milk supply, or catching diseases\r\nfrom horses and cows. The health of domestic animals ought to be\r\nas well cared for as the health of human beings."\r\n\r\nShe repeated the veterinary surgeon\'s words, and was of the same\r\nopinion as he about everything. It was evident that she could not\r\nlive a year without some attachment, and had found new happiness\r\nin the lodge. In any one else this would have been censured, but\r\nno one could think ill of Olenka; everything she did was so natural.\r\nNeither she nor the veterinary surgeon said anything to other people\r\nof the change in their relations, and tried, indeed, to conceal it,\r\nbut without success, for Olenka could not keep a secret. When he\r\nhad visitors, men serving in his regiment, and she poured out tea\r\nor served the supper, she would begin talking of the cattle plague,\r\nof the foot and mouth disease, and of the municipal slaughterhouses.\r\nHe was dreadfully embarrassed, and when the guests had gone, he\r\nwould seize her by the hand and hiss angrily:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve asked you before not to talk about what you don\'t understand.\r\nWhen we veterinary surgeons are talking among ourselves, please\r\ndon\'t put your word in. It\'s really annoying."\r\n\r\nAnd she would look at him with astonishment and dismay, and ask him\r\nin alarm: "But, Voloditchka, what _am_ I to talk about?"\r\n\r\nAnd with tears in her eyes she would embrace him, begging him not\r\nto be angry, and they were both happy.\r\n\r\nBut this happiness did not last long. The veterinary surgeon departed,\r\ndeparted for ever with his regiment, when it was transferred to a\r\ndistant place--to Siberia, it may be. And Olenka was left alone.\r\n\r\nNow she was absolutely alone. Her father had long been dead, and\r\nhis armchair lay in the attic, covered with dust and lame of one\r\nleg. She got thinner and plainer, and when people met her in the\r\nstreet they did not look at her as they used to, and did not smile\r\nto her; evidently her best years were over and left behind, and now\r\na new sort of life had begun for her, which did not bear thinking\r\nabout. In the evening Olenka sat in the porch, and heard the band\r\nplaying and the fireworks popping in the Tivoli, but now the sound\r\nstirred no response. She looked into her yard without interest,\r\nthought of nothing, wished for nothing, and afterwards, when night\r\ncame on she went to bed and dreamed of her empty yard. She ate and\r\ndrank as it were unwillingly.\r\n\r\nAnd what was worst of all, she had no opinions of any sort. She saw\r\nthe objects about her and understood what she saw, but could not\r\nform any opinion about them, and did not know what to talk about.\r\nAnd how awful it is not to have any opinions! One sees a bottle,\r\nfor instance, or the rain, or a peasant driving in his cart, but\r\nwhat the bottle is for, or the rain, or the peasant, and what is\r\nthe meaning of it, one can\'t say, and could not even for a thousand\r\nroubles. When she had Kukin, or Pustovalov, or the veterinary\r\nsurgeon, Olenka could explain everything, and give her opinion about\r\nanything you like, but now there was the same emptiness in her brain\r\nand in her heart as there was in her yard outside. And it was as\r\nharsh and as bitter as wormwood in the mouth.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the town grew in all directions. The road became\r\na street, and where the Tivoli and the timber-yard had been, there\r\nwere new turnings and houses. How rapidly time passes! Olenka\'s\r\nhouse grew dingy, the roof got rusty, the shed sank on one side,\r\nand the whole yard was overgrown with docks and stinging-nettles.\r\nOlenka herself had grown plain and elderly; in summer she sat in\r\nthe porch, and her soul, as before, was empty and dreary and full\r\nof bitterness. In winter she sat at her window and looked at the\r\nsnow. When she caught the scent of spring, or heard the chime of\r\nthe church bells, a sudden rush of memories from the past came over\r\nher, there was a tender ache in her heart, and her eyes brimmed\r\nover with tears; but this was only for a minute, and then came\r\nemptiness again and the sense of the futility of life. The black\r\nkitten, Briska, rubbed against her and purred softly, but Olenka\r\nwas not touched by these feline caresses. That was not what she\r\nneeded. She wanted a love that would absorb her whole being, her\r\nwhole soul and reason--that would give her ideas and an object\r\nin life, and would warm her old blood. And she would shake the\r\nkitten off her skirt and say with vexation:\r\n\r\n"Get along; I don\'t want you!"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was, day after day and year after year, and no joy, and\r\nno opinions. Whatever Mavra, the cook, said she accepted.\r\n\r\nOne hot July day, towards evening, just as the cattle were being\r\ndriven away, and the whole yard was full of dust, some one suddenly\r\nknocked at the gate. Olenka went to open it herself and was dumbfounded\r\nwhen she looked out: she saw Smirnin, the veterinary surgeon,\r\ngrey-headed, and dressed as a civilian. She suddenly remembered\r\neverything. She could not help crying and letting her head fall on\r\nhis breast without uttering a word, and in the violence of her\r\nfeeling she did not notice how they both walked into the house and\r\nsat down to tea.\r\n\r\n"My dear Vladimir Platonitch! What fate has brought you?" she\r\nmuttered, trembling with joy.\r\n\r\n"I want to settle here for good, Olga Semyonovna," he told her. "I\r\nhave resigned my post, and have come to settle down and try my luck\r\non my own account. Besides, it\'s time for my boy to go to school.\r\nHe\'s a big boy. I am reconciled with my wife, you know."\r\n\r\n"Where is she?\' asked Olenka.\r\n\r\n"She\'s at the hotel with the boy, and I\'m looking for lodgings."\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, my dear soul! Lodgings? Why not have my house? Why\r\nshouldn\'t that suit you? Why, my goodness, I wouldn\'t take any\r\nrent!" cried Olenka in a flutter, beginning to cry again. "You live\r\nhere, and the lodge will do nicely for me. Oh dear! how glad I am!"\r\n\r\nNext day the roof was painted and the walls were whitewashed, and\r\nOlenka, with her arms akimbo walked about the yard giving directions.\r\nHer face was beaming with her old smile, and she was brisk and alert\r\nas though she had waked from a long sleep. The veterinary\'s wife\r\narrived--a thin, plain lady, with short hair and a peevish\r\nexpression. With her was her little Sasha, a boy of ten, small for\r\nhis age, blue-eyed, chubby, with dimples in his cheeks. And scarcely\r\nhad the boy walked into the yard when he ran after the cat, and at\r\nonce there was the sound of his gay, joyous laugh.\r\n\r\n"Is that your puss, auntie?" he asked Olenka. "When she has little\r\nones, do give us a kitten. Mamma is awfully afraid of mice."\r\n\r\nOlenka talked to him, and gave him tea. Her heart warmed and there\r\nwas a sweet ache in her bosom, as though the boy had been her own\r\nchild. And when he sat at the table in the evening, going over his\r\nlessons, she looked at him with deep tenderness and pity as she\r\nmurmured to herself:\r\n\r\n"You pretty pet! . . . my precious! . . . Such a fair little thing,\r\nand so clever."\r\n\r\n"\'An island is a piece of land which is entirely surrounded by\r\nwater,\'" he read aloud.\r\n\r\n"An island is a piece of land," she repeated, and this was the first\r\nopinion to which she gave utterance with positive conviction after\r\nso many years of silence and dearth of ideas.\r\n\r\nNow she had opinions of her own, and at supper she talked to Sasha\'s\r\nparents, saying how difficult the lessons were at the high schools,\r\nbut that yet the high school was better than a commercial one, since\r\nwith a high-school education all careers were open to one, such as\r\nbeing a doctor or an engineer.\r\n\r\nSasha began going to the high school. His mother departed to Harkov\r\nto her sister\'s and did not return; his father used to go off every\r\nday to inspect cattle, and would often be away from home for three\r\ndays together, and it seemed to Olenka as though Sasha was entirely\r\nabandoned, that he was not wanted at home, that he was being starved,\r\nand she carried him off to her lodge and gave him a little room\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnd for six months Sasha had lived in the lodge with her. Every\r\nmorning Olenka came into his bedroom and found him fast asleep,\r\nsleeping noiselessly with his hand under his cheek. She was sorry\r\nto wake him.\r\n\r\n"Sashenka," she would say mournfully, "get up, darling. It\'s time\r\nfor school."\r\n\r\nHe would get up, dress and say his prayers, and then sit down to\r\nbreakfast, drink three glasses of tea, and eat two large cracknels\r\nand a half a buttered roll. All this time he was hardly awake and\r\na little ill-humoured in consequence.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t quite know your fable, Sashenka," Olenka would say,\r\nlooking at him as though he were about to set off on a long journey.\r\n"What a lot of trouble I have with you! You must work and do your\r\nbest, darling, and obey your teachers."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do leave me alone!" Sasha would say.\r\n\r\nThen he would go down the street to school, a little figure, wearing\r\na big cap and carrying a satchel on his shoulder. Olenka would\r\nfollow him noiselessly.\r\n\r\n"Sashenka!" she would call after him, and she would pop into his\r\nhand a date or a caramel. When he reached the street where the\r\nschool was, he would feel ashamed of being followed by a tall, stout\r\nwoman, he would turn round and say:\r\n\r\n"You\'d better go home, auntie. I can go the rest of the way alone."\r\n\r\nShe would stand still and look after him fixedly till he had\r\ndisappeared at the school-gate.\r\n\r\nAh, how she loved him! Of her former attachments not one had been\r\nso deep; never had her soul surrendered to any feeling so spontaneously,\r\nso disinterestedly, and so joyously as now that her maternal instincts\r\nwere aroused. For this little boy with the dimple in his cheek and\r\nthe big school cap, she would have given her whole life, she would\r\nhave given it with joy and tears of tenderness. Why? Who can tell\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\nWhen she had seen the last of Sasha, she returned home, contented\r\nand serene, brimming over with love; her face, which had grown\r\nyounger during the last six months, smiled and beamed; people meeting\r\nher looked at her with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Olga Semyonovna, darling. How are you, darling?"\r\n\r\n"The lessons at the high school are very difficult now," she would\r\nrelate at the market. "It\'s too much; in the first class yesterday\r\nthey gave him a fable to learn by heart, and a Latin translation\r\nand a problem. You know it\'s too much for a little chap."\r\n\r\nAnd she would begin talking about the teachers, the lessons, and\r\nthe school books, saying just what Sasha said.\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock they had dinner together: in the evening they\r\nlearned their lessons together and cried. When she put him to bed,\r\nshe would stay a long time making the Cross over him and murmuring\r\na prayer; then she would go to bed and dream of that far-away misty\r\nfuture when Sasha would finish his studies and become a doctor or\r\nan engineer, would have a big house of his own with horses and a\r\ncarriage, would get married and have children. . . . She would fall\r\nasleep still thinking of the same thing, and tears would run down\r\nher cheeks from her closed eyes, while the black cat lay purring\r\nbeside her: "Mrr, mrr, mrr."\r\n\r\nSuddenly there would come a loud knock at the gate.\r\n\r\nOlenka would wake up breathless with alarm, her heart throbbing.\r\nHalf a minute later would come another knock.\r\n\r\n"It must be a telegram from Harkov," she would think, beginning to\r\ntremble from head to foot. "Sasha\'s mother is sending for him from\r\nHarkov. . . . Oh, mercy on us!"\r\n\r\nShe was in despair. Her head, her hands, and her feet would turn\r\nchill, and she would feel that she was the most unhappy woman in\r\nthe world. But another minute would pass, voices would be heard:\r\nit would turn out to be the veterinary surgeon coming home from the\r\nclub.\r\n\r\n"Well, thank God!" she would think.\r\n\r\nAnd gradually the load in her heart would pass off, and she would\r\nfeel at ease. She would go back to bed thinking of Sasha, who lay\r\nsound asleep in the next room, sometimes crying out in his sleep:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give it you! Get away! Shut up!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARIADNE\r\n\r\nON the deck of a steamer sailing from Odessa to Sevastopol, a rather\r\ngood-looking gentleman, with a little round beard, came up to me\r\nto smoke, and said:\r\n\r\n"Notice those Germans sitting near the shelter? Whenever Germans\r\nor Englishmen get together, they talk about the crops, the price\r\nof wool, or their personal affairs. But for some reason or other\r\nwhen we Russians get together we never discuss anything but women\r\nand abstract subjects--but especially women."\r\n\r\nThis gentleman\'s face was familiar to me already. We had returned\r\nfrom abroad the evening before in the same train, and at Volotchisk\r\nwhen the luggage was being examined by the Customs, I saw him\r\nstanding with a lady, his travelling companion, before a perfect\r\nmountain of trunks and baskets filled with ladies\' clothes, and I\r\nnoticed how embarrassed and downcast he was when he had to pay duty\r\non some piece of silk frippery, and his companion protested and\r\nthreatened to make a complaint. Afterwards, on the way to Odessa,\r\nI saw him carrying little pies and oranges to the ladies\' compartment.\r\n\r\nIt was rather damp; the vessel swayed a little, and the ladies had\r\nretired to their cabins.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the little round beard sat down beside me and\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n"Yes, when Russians come together they discuss nothing but abstract\r\nsubjects and women. We are so intellectual, so solemn, that we utter\r\nnothing but truths and can discuss only questions of a lofty order.\r\nThe Russian actor does not know how to be funny; he acts with\r\nprofundity even in a farce. We\'re just the same: when we have got\r\nto talk of trifles we treat them only from an exalted point of view.\r\nIt comes from a lack of boldness, sincerity, and simplicity. We\r\ntalk so often about women, I fancy, because we are dissatisfied.\r\nWe take too ideal a view of women, and make demands out of all\r\nproportion with what reality can give us; we get something utterly\r\ndifferent from what we want, and the result is dissatisfaction,\r\nshattered hopes, and inward suffering, and if any one is suffering,\r\nhe\'s bound to talk of it. It does not bore you to go on with this\r\nconversation?\r\n\r\n"No, not in the least."\r\n\r\n"In that case, allow me to introduce myself," said my companion,\r\nrising from his seat a little:\r\n\r\n"Ivan Ilyitch Shamohin, a Moscow landowner of a sort. . . . You I\r\nknow very well."\r\n\r\nHe sat down and went on, looking at me with a genuine and friendly\r\nexpression:\r\n\r\n"A mediocre philosopher, like Max Nordau, would explain these\r\nincessant conversations about women as a form of erotic madness,\r\nor would put it down to our having been slave-owners and so on; I\r\ntake quite a different view of it. I repeat, we are dissatisfied\r\nbecause we are idealists. We want the creatures who bear us and our\r\nchildren to be superior to us and to everything in the world. When\r\nwe are young we adore and poeticize those with whom we are in love:\r\nlove and happiness with us are synonyms. Among us in Russia marriage\r\nwithout love is despised, sensuality is ridiculed and inspires\r\nrepulsion, and the greatest success is enjoyed by those tales and\r\nnovels in which women are beautiful, poetical, and exalted; and if\r\nthe Russian has been for years in ecstasies over Raphael\'s Madonna,\r\nor is eager for the emancipation of women, I assure you there is\r\nno affectation about it. But the trouble is that when we have been\r\nmarried or been intimate with a woman for some two or three years,\r\nwe begin to feel deceived and disillusioned: we pair off with others,\r\nand again--disappointment, again--repulsion, and in the long\r\nrun we become convinced that women are lying, trivial, fussy, unfair,\r\nundeveloped, cruel--in fact, far from being superior, are\r\nimmeasurably inferior to us men. And in our dissatisfaction and\r\ndisappointment there is nothing left for us but to grumble and talk\r\nabout what we\'ve been so cruelly deceived in."\r\n\r\nWhile Shamohin was talking I noticed that the Russian language and\r\nour Russian surroundings gave him great pleasure. This was probably\r\nbecause he had been very homesick abroad. Though he praised the\r\nRussians and ascribed to them a rare idealism, he did not disparage\r\nforeigners, and that I put down to his credit. It could be seen,\r\ntoo, that there was some uneasiness in his soul, that he wanted to\r\ntalk more of himself than of women, and that I was in for a long\r\nstory in the nature of a confession. And when we had asked for a\r\nbottle of wine and had each of us drunk a glass, this was how he\r\ndid in fact begin:\r\n\r\n"I remember in a novel of Weltmann\'s some one says, \'So that\'s the\r\nstory!\' and some one else answers, \'No, that\'s not the story--\r\nthat\'s only the introduction to the story.\' In the same way what\r\nI\'ve said so far is only the introduction; what I really want to\r\ntell you is my own love story. Excuse me, I must ask you again; it\r\nwon\'t bore you to listen?"\r\n\r\nI told him it would not, and he went on:\r\n\r\nThe scene of my story is laid in the Moscow province in one of its\r\nnorthern districts. The scenery there, I must tell you, is exquisite.\r\nOur homestead is on the high bank of a rapid stream, where the water\r\nchatters noisily day and night: imagine a big old garden, neat\r\nflower-beds, beehives, a kitchen-garden, and below it a river with\r\nleafy willows, which, when there is a heavy dew on them, have a\r\nlustreless look as though they had turned grey; and on the other\r\nside a meadow, and beyond the meadow on the upland a terrible, dark\r\npine forest. In that forest delicious, reddish agarics grow in\r\nendless profusion, and elks still live in its deepest recesses.\r\nWhen I am nailed up in my coffin I believe I shall still dream of\r\nthose early mornings, you know, when the sun hurts your eyes: or\r\nthe wonderful spring evenings when the nightingales and the landrails\r\ncall in the garden and beyond the garden, and sounds of the harmonica\r\nfloat across from the village, while they play the piano indoors\r\nand the stream babbles . . . when there is such music, in fact,\r\nthat one wants at the same time to cry and to sing aloud.\r\n\r\nWe have not much arable land, but our pasture makes up for it, and\r\nwith the forest yields about two thousand roubles a year. I am the\r\nonly son of my father; we are both modest persons, and with my\r\nfather\'s pension that sum was amply sufficient for us.\r\n\r\nThe first three years after finishing at the university I spent in\r\nthe country, looking after the estate and constantly expecting to\r\nbe elected on some local assembly; but what was most important, I\r\nwas violently in love with an extraordinarily beautiful and fascinating\r\ngirl. She was the sister of our neighbour, Kotlovitch, a ruined\r\nlandowner who had on his estate pine-apples, marvellous peaches,\r\nlightning conductors, a fountain in the courtyard, and at the same\r\ntime not a farthing in his pocket. He did nothing and knew how to\r\ndo nothing. He was as flabby as though he had been made of boiled\r\nturnip; he used to doctor the peasants by homeopathy and was\r\ninterested in spiritualism. He was, however, a man of great delicacy\r\nand mildness, and by no means a fool, but I have no fondness for\r\nthese gentlemen who converse with spirits and cure peasant women\r\nby magnetism. In the first place, the ideas of people who are not\r\nintellectually free are always in a muddle, and it\'s extremely\r\ndifficult to talk to them; and, secondly, they usually love no one,\r\nand have nothing to do with women, and their mysticism has an\r\nunpleasant effect on sensitive people. I did not care for his\r\nappearance either. He was tall, stout, white-skinned, with a little\r\nhead, little shining eyes, and chubby white fingers. He did not\r\nshake hands, but kneaded one\'s hands in his. And he was always\r\napologising. If he asked for anything it was "Excuse me"; if he\r\ngave you anything it was "Excuse me" too.\r\n\r\nAs for his sister, she was a character out of a different opera. I\r\nmust explain that I had not been acquainted with the Kotlovitches\r\nin my childhood and early youth, for my father had been a professor\r\nat N., and we had for many years lived away. When I did make their\r\nacquaintance the girl was twenty-two, had left school long before,\r\nand had spent two or three years in Moscow with a wealthy aunt who\r\nbrought her out into society. When I was introduced and first had\r\nto talk to her, what struck me most of all was her rare and beautiful\r\nname--Ariadne. It suited her so wonderfully! She was a brunette,\r\nvery thin, very slender, supple, elegant, and extremely graceful,\r\nwith refined and exceedingly noble features. Her eyes were shining,\r\ntoo, but her brother\'s shone with a cold sweetness, mawkish as\r\nsugar-candy, while hers had the glow of youth, proud and beautiful.\r\nShe conquered me on the first day of our acquaintance, and indeed\r\nit was inevitable. My first impression was so overwhelming that to\r\nthis day I cannot get rid of my illusions; I am still tempted to\r\nimagine that nature had some grand, marvellous design when she\r\ncreated that girl.\r\n\r\nAriadne\'s voice, her walk, her hat, even her footprints on the sandy\r\nbank where she used to angle for gudgeon, filled me with delight\r\nand a passionate hunger for life. I judged of her spiritual being\r\nfrom her lovely face and lovely figure, and every word, every smile\r\nof Ariadne\'s bewitched me, conquered me and forced me to believe\r\nin the loftiness of her soul. She was friendly, ready to talk, gay\r\nand simple in her manners. She had a poetic belief in God, made\r\npoetic reflections about death, and there was such a wealth of\r\nvarying shades in her spiritual organisation that even her faults\r\nseemed in her to carry with them peculiar, charming qualities.\r\nSuppose she wanted a new horse and had no money--what did that\r\nmatter? Something might be sold or pawned, or if the steward swore\r\nthat nothing could possibly be sold or pawned, the iron roofs might\r\nbe torn off the lodges and taken to the factory, or at the very\r\nbusiest time the farm-horses might be driven to the market and sold\r\nthere for next to nothing. These unbridled desires reduced the whole\r\nhousehold to despair at times, but she expressed them with such\r\nrefinement that everything was forgiven her; all things were permitted\r\nher as to a goddess or to C\xe6sar\'s wife. My love was pathetic and\r\nwas soon noticed by every one--my father, the neighbours, and the\r\npeasants--and they all sympathised with me. When I stood the\r\nworkmen vodka, they would bow and say: "May the Kotlovitch young\r\nlady be your bride, please God!"\r\n\r\nAnd Ariadne herself knew that I loved her. She would often ride\r\nover on horseback or drive in the char-\xe0-banc to see us, and would\r\nspend whole days with me and my father. She made great friends with\r\nthe old man, and he even taught her to bicycle, which was his\r\nfavourite amusement.\r\n\r\nI remember helping her to get on the bicycle one evening, and she\r\nlooked so lovely that I felt as though I were burning my hands when\r\nI touched her. I shuddered with rapture, and when the two of them,\r\nmy old father and she, both looking so handsome and elegant, bicycled\r\nside by side along the main road, a black horse ridden by the steward\r\ndashed aside on meeting them, and it seemed to me that it dashed\r\naside because it too was overcome by her beauty. My love, my worship,\r\ntouched Ariadne and softened her; she had a passionate longing to\r\nbe captivated like me and to respond with the same love. It was so\r\npoetical!\r\n\r\nBut she was incapable of really loving as I did, for she was cold\r\nand already somewhat corrupted. There was a demon in her, whispering\r\nto her day and night that she was enchanting, adorable; and, having\r\nno definite idea for what object she was created, or for what purpose\r\nlife had been given her, she never pictured herself in the future\r\nexcept as very wealthy and distinguished, she had visions of balls,\r\nraces, liveries, of sumptuous drawing-rooms, of a salon of her own,\r\nand of a perfect swarm of counts, princes, ambassadors, celebrated\r\npainters and artists, all of them adoring her and in ecstasies over\r\nher beauty and her dresses. . . .\r\n\r\nThis thirst for personal success, and this continual concentration\r\nof the mind in one direction, makes people cold, and Ariadne was\r\ncold--to me, to nature, and to music. Meanwhile time was passing,\r\nand still there were no ambassadors on the scene. Ariadne went on\r\nliving with her brother, the spiritualist: things went from bad to\r\nworse, so that she had nothing to buy hats and dresses with, and\r\nhad to resort to all sorts of tricks and dodges to conceal her\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, a certain Prince Maktuev, a wealthy man but\r\nan utterly insignificant person, had paid his addresses to her when\r\nshe was living at her aunt\'s in Moscow. She had refused him,\r\npoint-blank. But now she was fretted by the worm of repentance that\r\nshe had refused him; just as a peasant pouts with repulsion at a\r\nmug of kvass with cockroaches in it but yet drinks it, so she frowned\r\ndisdainfully at the recollection of the prince, and yet she would\r\nsay to me: "Say what you like, there is something inexplicable,\r\nfascinating, in a title. . . ."\r\n\r\nShe dreamed of a title, of a brilliant position, and at the same\r\ntime she did not want to let me go. However one may dream of\r\nambassadors one\'s heart is not a stone, and one has wistful feelings\r\nfor one\'s youth. Ariadne tried to fall in love, made a show of being\r\nin love, and even swore that she loved me. But I am a highly strung\r\nand sensitive man; when I am loved I feel it even at a distance,\r\nwithout vows and assurances; at once I felt as it were a coldness\r\nin the air, and when she talked to me of love, it seemed to me as\r\nthough I were listening to the singing of a metal nightingale.\r\nAriadne was herself aware that she was lacking in something. She\r\nwas vexed and more than once I saw her cry. Another time--can you\r\nimagine it?--all of a sudden she embraced me and kissed me. It\r\nhappened in the evening on the river-bank, and I saw by her eyes\r\nthat she did not love me, but was embracing me from curiosity, to\r\ntest herself and to see what came of it. And I felt dreadful. I\r\ntook her hands and said to her in despair: "These caresses without\r\nlove cause me suffering!"\r\n\r\n"What a queer fellow you are!" she said with annoyance, and walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAnother year or two might have passed, and in all probability I\r\nshould have married her, and so my story would have ended, but fate\r\nwas pleased to arrange our romance differently. It happened that a\r\nnew personage appeared on our horizon. Ariadne\'s brother had a visit\r\nfrom an old university friend called Mihail Ivanitch Lubkov, a\r\ncharming man of whom coachmen and footmen used to say: "An entertaining\r\ngentleman." He was a man of medium height, lean and bald, with a\r\nface like a good-natured bourgeois, not interesting, but pale and\r\npresentable, with a stiff, well-kept moustache, with a neck like\r\ngooseskin, and a big Adam\'s apple. He used to wear pince-nez on a\r\nwide black ribbon, lisped, and could not pronounce either _r_ or\r\n_l_. He was always in good spirits, everything amused him.\r\n\r\nHe had made an exceedingly foolish marriage at twenty, and had\r\nacquired two houses in Moscow as part of his wife\'s dowry. He began\r\ndoing them up and building a bath-house, and was completely ruined.\r\nNow his wife and four children lodged in Oriental Buildings in great\r\npoverty, and he had to support them--and this amused him. He was\r\nthirty-six and his wife was by now forty-two, and that, too, amused\r\nhim. His mother, a conceited, sulky personage, with aristocratic\r\npretensions, despised his wife and lived apart with a perfect\r\nmenagerie of cats and dogs, and he had to allow her seventy-five\r\nroubles a month also; he was, too, a man of taste, liked lunching\r\nat the Slavyansky Bazaar and dining at the Hermitage; he needed a\r\ngreat deal of money, but his uncle only allowed him two thousand\r\nroubles a year, which was not enough, and for days together he would\r\nrun about Moscow with his tongue out, as the saying is, looking for\r\nsome one to borrow from--and this, too, amused him. He had come\r\nto Kotlovitch to find in the lap of nature, as he said, a rest from\r\nfamily life. At dinner, at supper, and on our walks, he talked about\r\nhis wife, about his mother, about his creditors, about the bailiffs,\r\nand laughed at them; he laughed at himself and assured us that,\r\nthanks to his talent for borrowing, he had made a great number of\r\nagreeable acquaintances. He laughed without ceasing and we laughed\r\ntoo. Moreover, in his company we spent our time differently. I was\r\nmore inclined to quiet, so to say idyllic pleasures; I liked fishing,\r\nevening walks, gathering mushrooms; Lubkov preferred picnics,\r\nfireworks, hunting. He used to get up picnics three times a week,\r\nand Ariadne, with an earnest and inspired face, used to write a\r\nlist of oysters, champagne, sweets, and used to send me into Moscow\r\nto get them, without inquiring, of course, whether I had money. And\r\nat the picnics there were toasts and laughter, and again mirthful\r\ndescriptions of how old his wife was, what fat lap-dogs his mother\r\nhad, and what charming people his creditors were.\r\n\r\nLubkov was fond of nature, but he regarded it as something long\r\nfamiliar and at the same time, in reality, infinitely beneath himself\r\nand created for his pleasure. He would sometimes stand still before\r\nsome magnificent landscape and say: "It would be nice to have tea\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nOne day, seeing Ariadne walking in the distance with a parasol, he\r\nnodded towards her and said:\r\n\r\n"She\'s thin, and that\'s what I like; I don\'t like fat women."\r\n\r\nThis made me wince. I asked him not to speak like that about women\r\nbefore me. He looked at me in surprise and said:\r\n\r\n"What is there amiss in my liking thin women and not caring for fat\r\nones?"\r\n\r\nI made no answer. Afterwards, being in very good spirits and a\r\ntrifle elevated, he said:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve noticed Ariadne Grigoryevna likes you. I can\'t understand why\r\nyou don\'t go in and win."\r\n\r\nHis words made me feel uncomfortable, and with some embarrassment\r\nI told him how I looked at love and women.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he sighed; "to my thinking, a woman\'s a woman and\r\na man\'s a man. Ariadne Grigoryevna may be poetical and exalted, as\r\nyou say, but it doesn\'t follow that she must be superior to the\r\nlaws of nature. You see for yourself that she has reached the age\r\nwhen she must have a husband or a lover. I respect women as much\r\nas you do, but I don\'t think certain relations exclude poetry.\r\nPoetry\'s one thing and love is another. It\'s just the same as it\r\nis in farming. The beauty of nature is one thing and the income\r\nfrom your forests or fields is quite another."\r\n\r\nWhen Ariadne and I were fishing, Lubkov would lie on the sand close\r\nby and make fun of me, or lecture me on the conduct of life.\r\n\r\n"I wonder, my dear sir, how you can live without a love affair,"\r\nhe would say. "You are young, handsome, interesting--in fact,\r\nyou\'re a man not to be sniffed at, yet you live like a monk. Och!\r\nI can\'t stand these fellows who are old at twenty-eight! I\'m nearly\r\nten years older than you are, and yet which of us is the younger?\r\nAriadne Grigoryevna, which?"\r\n\r\n"You, of course," Ariadne answered him.\r\n\r\nAnd when he was bored with our silence and the attention with which\r\nwe stared at our floats he went home, and she said, looking at me\r\nangrily:\r\n\r\n"You\'re really not a man, but a mush, God forgive me! A man ought\r\nto be able to be carried away by his feelings, he ought to be able\r\nto be mad, to make mistakes, to suffer! A woman will forgive you\r\naudacity and insolence, but she will never forgive your reasonableness!"\r\n\r\nShe was angry in earnest, and went on:\r\n\r\n"To succeed, a man must be resolute and bold. Lubkov is not so\r\nhandsome as you are, but he is more interesting. He will always\r\nsucceed with women because he\'s not like you; he\'s a man. . . ."\r\n\r\nAnd there was actually a note of exasperation in her voice.\r\n\r\nOne day at supper she began saying, not addressing me, that if she\r\nwere a man she would not stagnate in the country, but would travel,\r\nwould spend the winter somewhere aboard--in Italy, for instance.\r\nOh, Italy! At this point my father unconsciously poured oil on the\r\nflames; he began telling us at length about Italy, how splendid it\r\nwas there, the exquisite scenery, the museums. Ariadne suddenly\r\nconceived a burning desire to go to Italy. She positively brought\r\nher fist down on the table and her eyes flashed as she said: "I\r\nmust go!"\r\n\r\nAfter that came conversations every day about Italy: how splendid\r\nit would be in Italy--ah, Italy!--oh, Italy! And when Ariadne\r\nlooked at me over her shoulder, from her cold and obstinate expression\r\nI saw that in her dreams she had already conquered Italy with all\r\nits salons, celebrated foreigners and tourists, and there was no\r\nholding her back now. I advised her to wait a little, to put off\r\nher tour for a year or two, but she frowned disdainfully and said:\r\n\r\n"You\'re as prudent as an old woman!"\r\n\r\nLubkov was in favour of the tour. He said it could be done very\r\ncheaply, and he, too, would go to Italy and have a rest there from\r\nfamily life.\r\n\r\nI behaved, I confess, as na\xefvely as a schoolboy.\r\n\r\nNot from jealousy, but from a foreboding of something terrible and\r\nextraordinary, I tried as far as possible not to leave them alone\r\ntogether, and they made fun of me. For instance, when I went in\r\nthey would pretend they had just been kissing one another, and so\r\non. But lo and behold, one fine morning, her plump, white-skinned\r\nbrother, the spiritualist, made his appearance and expressed his\r\ndesire to speak to me alone.\r\n\r\nHe was a man without will; in spite of his education and his delicacy\r\nhe could never resist reading another person\'s letter, if it lay\r\nbefore him on the table. And now he admitted that he had by chance\r\nread a letter of Lubkov\'s to Ariadne.\r\n\r\n"From that letter I learned that she is very shortly going abroad.\r\nMy dear fellow, I am very much upset! Explain it to me for goodness\'\r\nsake. I can make nothing of it!"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he breathed hard, breathing straight in my face and\r\nsmelling of boiled beef.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me for revealing the secret of this letter to you, but you\r\nare Ariadne\'s friend, she respects you. Perhaps you know something\r\nof it. She wants to go away, but with whom? Mr. Lubkov is proposing\r\nto go with her. Excuse me, but this is very strange of Mr. Lubkov;\r\nhe is a married man, he has children, and yet he is making a\r\ndeclaration of love; he is writing to Ariadne \'darling.\' Excuse me,\r\nbut it is so strange!"\r\n\r\nI turned cold all over; my hands and feet went numb and I felt an\r\nache in my chest, as if a three-cornered stone had been driven into\r\nit. Kotlovitch sank helplessly into an easy-chair, and his hands\r\nfell limply at his sides.\r\n\r\n"What can I do?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Persuade her. . . . Impress her mind. . . . Just consider, what\r\nis Lubkov to her? Is he a match for her? Oh, good God! How awful\r\nit is, how awful it is!" he went on, clutching his head. "She has\r\nhad such splendid offers--Prince Maktuev and . . . and others.\r\nThe prince adores her, and only last Wednesday week his late\r\ngrandfather, Ilarion, declared positively that Ariadne would be his\r\nwife--positively! His grandfather Ilarion is dead, but he is a\r\nwonderfully intelligent person; we call up his spirit every day."\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation I lay awake all night and thought of shooting\r\nmyself. In the morning I wrote five letters and tore them all up.\r\nThen I sobbed in the barn. Then I took a sum of money from my father\r\nand set off for the Caucasus without saying good-bye.\r\n\r\nOf course, a woman\'s a woman and a man\'s a man, but can all that\r\nbe as simple in our day as it was before the Flood, and can it be\r\nthat I, a cultivated man endowed with a complex spiritual organisation,\r\nought to explain the intense attraction I feel towards a woman\r\nsimply by the fact that her bodily formation is different from mine?\r\nOh, how awful that would be! I want to believe that in his struggle\r\nwith nature the genius of man has struggled with physical love too,\r\nas with an enemy, and that, if he has not conquered it, he has at\r\nleast succeeded in tangling it in a net-work of illusions of\r\nbrotherhood and love; and for me, at any rate, it is no longer a\r\nsimple instinct of my animal nature as with a dog or a toad, but\r\nis real love, and every embrace is spiritualised by a pure impulse\r\nof the heart and respect for the woman. In reality, a disgust for\r\nthe animal instinct has been trained for ages in hundreds of\r\ngenerations; it is inherited by me in my blood and forms part of\r\nmy nature, and if I poetize love, is not that as natural and\r\ninevitable in our day as my ears\' not being able to move and my not\r\nbeing covered with fur? I fancy that\'s how the majority of civilised\r\npeople look at it, so that the absence of the moral, poetical element\r\nin love is treated in these days as a phenomenon, as a sign of\r\natavism; they say it is a symptom of degeneracy, of many forms of\r\ninsanity. It is true that, in poetizing love, we assume in those\r\nwe love qualities that are lacking in them, and that is a source\r\nof continual mistakes and continual miseries for us. But to my\r\nthinking it is better, even so; that is, it is better to suffer\r\nthan to find complacency on the basis of woman being woman and man\r\nbeing man.\r\n\r\nIn Tiflis I received a letter from my father. He wrote that Ariadne\r\nGrigoryevna had on such a day gone abroad, intending to spend the\r\nwhole winter away. A month later I returned home. It was by now\r\nautumn. Every week Ariadne sent my father extremely interesting\r\nletters on scented paper, written in an excellent literary style.\r\nIt is my opinion that every woman can be a writer. Ariadne described\r\nin great detail how it had not been easy for her to make it up with\r\nher aunt and induce the latter to give her a thousand roubles for\r\nthe journey, and what a long time she had spent in Moscow trying\r\nto find an old lady, a distant relation, in order to persuade her\r\nto go with her. Such a profusion of detail suggested fiction, and\r\nI realised, of course, that she had no chaperon with her.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards I, too, had a letter from her, also scented and\r\nliterary. She wrote that she had missed me, missed my beautiful,\r\nintelligent, loving eyes. She reproached me affectionately for\r\nwasting my youth, for stagnating in the country when I might, like\r\nher, be living in paradise under the palms, breathing the fragrance\r\nof the orange-trees. And she signed herself "Your forsaken Ariadne."\r\nTwo days later came another letter in the same style, signed "Your\r\nforgotten Ariadne." My mind was confused. I loved her passionately,\r\nI dreamed of her every night, and then this "your forsaken," "your\r\nforgotten"--what did it mean? What was it for? And then the\r\ndreariness of the country, the long evenings, the disquieting\r\nthoughts of Lubkov. . . . The uncertainty tortured me, and poisoned\r\nmy days and nights; it became unendurable. I could not bear it and\r\nwent abroad.\r\n\r\nAriadne summoned me to Abbazzia. I arrived there on a bright warm\r\nday after rain; the rain-drops were still hanging on the trees and\r\nglistening on the huge, barrack-like d\xe9pendance where Ariadne and\r\nLubkov were living.\r\n\r\nThey were not at home. I went into the park; wandered about the\r\navenues, then sat down. An Austrian General, with his hands behind\r\nhim, walked past me, with red stripes on his trousers such as our\r\ngenerals wear. A baby was wheeled by in a perambulator and the\r\nwheels squeaked on the damp sand. A decrepit old man with jaundice\r\npassed, then a crowd of Englishwomen, a Catholic priest, then the\r\nAustrian General again. A military band, only just arrived from\r\nFiume, with glittering brass instruments, sauntered by to the\r\nbandstand--they began playing.\r\n\r\nHave you ever been at Abbazzia? It\'s a filthy little Slav town with\r\nonly one street, which stinks, and in which one can\'t walk after\r\nrain without goloshes. I had read so much and always with such\r\nintense feeling about this earthly paradise that when afterwards,\r\nholding up my trousers, I cautiously crossed the narrow street, and\r\nin my ennui bought some hard pears from an old peasant woman who,\r\nrecognising me as a Russian, said: "Tcheeteery" for "tchetyry"\r\n(four)--"davadtsat" for "dvadtsat" (twenty), and when I wondered\r\nin perplexity where to go and what to do here, and when I inevitably\r\nmet Russians as disappointed as I was, I began to feel vexed and\r\nashamed. There is a calm bay there full of steamers and boats with\r\ncoloured sails. From there I could see Fiume and the distant islands\r\ncovered with lilac mist, and it would have been picturesque if the\r\nview over the bay had not been hemmed in by the hotels and their\r\nd\xe9pendances--buildings in an absurd, trivial style of architecture,\r\nwith which the whole of that green shore has been covered by greedy\r\nmoney grubbers, so that for the most part you see nothing in this\r\nlittle paradise but windows, terraces, and little squares with\r\ntables and waiters\' black coats. There is a park such as you find\r\nnow in every watering-place abroad. And the dark, motionless, silent\r\nfoliage of the palms, and the bright yellow sand in the avenue, and\r\nthe bright green seats, and the glitter of the braying military\r\nhorns--all this sickened me in ten minutes! And yet one is obliged\r\nfor some reason to spend ten days, ten weeks, there!\r\n\r\nHaving been dragged reluctantly from one of these watering-places\r\nto another, I have been more and more struck by the inconvenient\r\nand niggardly life led by the wealthy and well-fed, the dulness and\r\nfeebleness of their imagination, the lack of boldness in their\r\ntastes and desires. And how much happier are those tourists, old\r\nand young, who, not having the money to stay in hotels, live where\r\nthey can, admire the view of the sea from the tops of the mountains,\r\nlying on the green grass, walk instead of riding, see the forests\r\nand villages at close quarters, observe the customs of the country,\r\nlisten to its songs, fall in love with its women. . . .\r\n\r\nWhile I was sitting in the park, it began to get dark, and in the\r\ntwilight my Ariadne appeared, elegant and dressed like a princess;\r\nafter her walked Lubkov, wearing a new loose-fitting suit, bought\r\nprobably in Vienna.\r\n\r\n"Why are you cross with me?" he was saying. "What have I done to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nSeeing me, she uttered a cry of joy, and probably, if we had not\r\nbeen in the park, would have thrown herself on my neck. She pressed\r\nmy hands warmly and laughed; and I laughed too and almost cried\r\nwith emotion. Questions followed, of the village, of my father,\r\nwhether I had seen her brother, and so on. She insisted on my looking\r\nher straight in the face, and asked if I remembered the gudgeon,\r\nour little quarrels, the picnics. . . .\r\n\r\n"How nice it all was really!" she sighed. "But we\'re not having a\r\nslow time here either. We have a great many acquaintances, my dear,\r\nmy best of friends! To-morrow I will introduce you to a Russian\r\nfamily here, but please buy yourself another hat." She scrutinised\r\nme and frowned. "Abbazzia is not the country," she said; "here one\r\nmust be _comme il faut_."\r\n\r\nThen we went to the restaurant. Ariadne was laughing and mischievous\r\nall the time; she kept calling me "dear," "good," "clever," and\r\nseemed as though she could not believe her eyes that I was with\r\nher. We sat on till eleven o\'clock, and parted very well satisfied\r\nboth with the supper and with each other.\r\n\r\nNext day Ariadne presented me to the Russian family as: "The son\r\nof a distinguished professor whose estate is next to ours."\r\n\r\nShe talked to this family about nothing but estates and crops, and\r\nkept appealing to me. She wanted to appear to be a very wealthy\r\nlandowner, and did, in fact, succeed in doing so. Her manner was\r\nsuperb like that of a real aristocrat, which indeed she was by\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n"But what a person my aunt is!" she said suddenly, looking at me\r\nwith a smile. "We had a slight tiff, and she has bolted off to\r\nMeran. What do you say to that?"\r\n\r\nAfterwards when we were walking in the park I asked her:\r\n\r\n"What aunt were you talking of just now? What aunt is that?"\r\n\r\n"That was a saving lie," laughed Ariadne. "They must not know I\'m\r\nwithout a chaperon."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s silence she came closer to me and said:\r\n\r\n"My dear, my dear, do be friends with Lubkov. He is so unhappy! His\r\nwife and mother are simply awful."\r\n\r\nShe used the formal mode of address in speaking to Lubkov, and when\r\nshe was going up to bed she said good-night to him exactly as she\r\ndid to me, and their rooms were on different floors. All this made\r\nme hope that it was all nonsense, and that there was no sort of\r\nlove affair between them, and I felt at ease when I met him. And\r\nwhen one day he asked me for the loan of three hundred roubles, I\r\ngave it to him with the greatest pleasure.\r\n\r\nEvery day we spent in enjoying ourselves and in nothing but enjoying\r\nourselves; we strolled in the park, we ate, we drank. Every day\r\nthere were conversations with the Russian family. By degrees I got\r\nused to the fact that if I went into the park I should be sure to\r\nmeet the old man with jaundice, the Catholic priest, and the Austrian\r\nGeneral, who always carried a pack of little cards, and wherever\r\nit was possible sat down and played patience, nervously twitching\r\nhis shoulders. And the band played the same thing over and over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt home in the country I used to feel ashamed to meet the peasants\r\nwhen I was fishing or on a picnic party on a working day; here too\r\nI was ashamed at the sight of the footmen, the coachmen, and the\r\nworkmen who met us. It always seemed to me they were looking at me\r\nand thinking: "Why are you doing nothing?" And I was conscious of\r\nthis feeling of shame every day from morning to night. It was a\r\nstrange, unpleasant, monotonous time; it was only varied by Lubkov\'s\r\nborrowing from me now a hundred, now fifty guldens, and being\r\nsuddenly revived by the money as a morphia-maniac is by morphia,\r\nbeginning to laugh loudly at his wife, at himself, at his creditors.\r\n\r\nAt last it began to be rainy and cold. We went to Italy, and I\r\ntelegraphed to my father begging him for mercy\'s sake to send me\r\neight hundred roubles to Rome. We stayed in Venice, in Bologna, in\r\nFlorence, and in every town invariably put up at an expensive hotel,\r\nwhere we were charged separately for lights, and for service, and\r\nfor heating, and for bread at lunch, and for the right of having\r\ndinner by ourselves. We ate enormously. In the morning they gave\r\nus _caf\xe9 complet_; at one o\'clock lunch: meat, fish, some sort of\r\nomelette, cheese, fruits, and wine. At six o\'clock dinner of eight\r\ncourses with long intervals, during which we drank beer and wine.\r\nAt nine o\'clock tea. At midnight Ariadne would declare she was\r\nhungry, and ask for ham and boiled eggs. We would eat to keep her\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals between meals we used to rush about the museums\r\nand exhibitions in continual anxiety for fear we should be late for\r\ndinner or lunch. I was bored at the sight of the pictures; I longed\r\nto be at home to rest; I was exhausted, looked about for a chair\r\nand hypocritically repeated after other people: "How exquisite,\r\nwhat atmosphere!" Like overfed boa constrictors, we noticed only\r\nthe most glaring objects. The shop windows hypnotised us; we went\r\ninto ecstasies over imitation brooches and bought a mass of useless\r\ntrumpery.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened in Rome, where it rained and there was a\r\ncold wind. After a heavy lunch we went to look at St. Peter\'s, and\r\nthanks to our replete condition and perhaps the bad weather, it\r\nmade no sort of impression on us, and detecting in each other an\r\nindifference to art, we almost quarrelled.\r\n\r\nThe money came from my father. I went to get it, I remember, in the\r\nmorning. Lubkov went with me.\r\n\r\n"The present cannot be full and happy when one has a past," said\r\nhe. "I have heavy burdens left on me by the past. However, if only\r\nI get the money, it\'s no great matter, but if not, I\'m in a fix.\r\nWould you believe it, I have only eight francs left, yet I must\r\nsend my wife a hundred and my mother another. And we must live here\r\ntoo. Ariadne\'s like a child; she won\'t enter into the position, and\r\nflings away money like a duchess. Why did she buy a watch yesterday?\r\nAnd, tell me, what object is there in our going on playing at being\r\ngood children? Why, our hiding our relations from the servants and\r\nour friends costs us from ten to fifteen francs a day, as I have\r\nto have a separate room. What\'s the object of it?"\r\n\r\nI felt as though a sharp stone had been turned round in my chest.\r\nThere was no uncertainty now; it was all clear to me. I turned cold\r\nall over, and at once made a resolution to give up seeing them, to\r\nrun away from them, to go home at once. . . .\r\n\r\n"To get on terms with a woman is easy enough," Lubkov went on. "You\r\nhave only to undress her; but afterwards what a bore it is, what a\r\nsilly business!"\r\n\r\nWhen I counted over the money I received he said:\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t lend me a thousand francs, I am faced with complete\r\nruin. Your money is the only resource left to me."\r\n\r\nI gave him the money, and he at once revived and began laughing\r\nabout his uncle, a queer fish, who could never keep his address\r\nsecret from his wife. When I reached the hotel I packed and paid\r\nmy bill. I had still to say good-bye to Ariadne.\r\n\r\nI knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n"Entrez!"\r\n\r\nIn her room was the usual morning disorder: tea-things on the table,\r\nan unfinished roll, an eggshell; a strong overpowering reek of\r\nscent. The bed had not been made, and it was evident that two had\r\nslept in it.\r\n\r\nAriadne herself had only just got out of bed and was now with her\r\nhair down in a flannel dressing-jacket.\r\n\r\nI said good-morning to her, and then sat in silence for a minute\r\nwhile she tried to put her hair tidy, and then I asked her, trembling\r\nall over:\r\n\r\n"Why . . . why . . . did you send for me here?"\r\n\r\nEvidently she guessed what I was thinking; she took me by the hand\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n"I want you to be here, you are so pure."\r\n\r\nI felt ashamed of my emotion, of my trembling. And I was afraid I\r\nmight begin sobbing, too! I went out without saying another word,\r\nand within an hour I was sitting in the train. All the journey, for\r\nsome reason, I imagined Ariadne with child, and she seemed disgusting\r\nto me, and all the women I saw in the trains and at the stations\r\nlooked to me, for some reason, as if they too were with child, and\r\nthey too seemed disgusting and pitiable. I was in the position of\r\na greedy, passionate miser who should suddenly discover that all\r\nhis gold coins were false. The pure, gracious images which my\r\nimagination, warmed by love, had cherished for so long, my plans,\r\nmy hopes, my memories, my ideas of love and of woman--all now\r\nwere jeering and putting out their tongues at me. "Ariadne," I kept\r\nasking with horror, "that young, intellectual, extraordinarily\r\nbeautiful girl, the daughter of a senator, carrying on an intrigue\r\nwith such an ordinary, uninteresting vulgarian? But why should she\r\nnot love Lubkov?" I answered myself. "In what is he inferior to me?\r\nOh, let her love any one she likes, but why lie to me? But why is\r\nshe bound to be open with me?" And so I went on over and over again\r\ntill I was stupefied.\r\n\r\nIt was cold in the train; I was travelling first class, but even\r\nso there were three on a side, there were no double windows, the\r\nouter door opened straight into the compartment, and I felt as\r\nthough I were in the stocks, cramped, abandoned, pitiful, and my\r\nlegs were fearfully numb, and at the same time I kept recalling how\r\nfascinating she had been that morning in her dressing-jacket and\r\nwith her hair down, and I was suddenly overcome by such acute\r\njealousy that I leapt up in anguish, so that my neighbours stared\r\nat me in wonder and positive alarm.\r\n\r\nAt home I found deep snow and twenty degrees of frost. I\'m fond of\r\nthe winter; I\'m fond of it because at that time, even in the hardest\r\nfrosts, it\'s particularly snug at home. It\'s pleasant to put on\r\none\'s fur jacket and felt overboots on a clear frosty day, to do\r\nsomething in the garden or in the yard, or to read in a well warmed\r\nroom, to sit in my father\'s study before the open fire, to wash in\r\nmy country bath-house. . . . Only if there is no mother in the\r\nhouse, no sister and no children, it is somehow dreary on winter\r\nevenings, and they seem extraordinarily long and quiet. And the\r\nwarmer and snugger it is, the more acutely is this lack felt. In\r\nthe winter when I came back from abroad, the evenings were endlessly\r\nlong, I was intensely depressed, so depressed that I could not even\r\nread; in the daytime I was coming and going, clearing away the snow\r\nin the garden or feeding the chickens and the calves, but in the\r\nevening it was all up with me.\r\n\r\nI had never cared for visitors before, but now I was glad of them,\r\nfor I knew there was sure to be talk of Ariadne. Kotlovitch, the\r\nspiritualist, used often to come to talk about his sister, and\r\nsometimes he brought with him his friend Prince Maktuev, who was\r\nas much in love with Ariadne as I was. To sit in Ariadne\'s room,\r\nto finger the keys of her piano, to look at her music was a necessity\r\nfor the prince--he could not live without it; and the spirit of\r\nhis grandfather Ilarion was still predicting that sooner or later\r\nshe would be his wife. The prince usually stayed a long time with\r\nus, from lunch to midnight, saying nothing all the time; in silence\r\nhe would drink two or three bottles of beer, and from time to time,\r\nto show that he too was taking part in the conversation, he would\r\nlaugh an abrupt, melancholy, foolish laugh. Before going home he\r\nwould always take me aside and ask me in an undertone: "When did\r\nyou see Ariadne Grigoryevna last? Was she quite well? I suppose\r\nshe\'s not tired of being out there?"\r\n\r\nSpring came on. There was the harrowing to do and then the sowing\r\nof spring corn and clover. I was sad, but there was the feeling of\r\nspring. One longed to accept the inevitable. Working in the fields\r\nand listening to the larks, I asked myself: "Couldn\'t I have done\r\nwith this question of personal happiness once and for all? Couldn\'t\r\nI lay aside my fancy and marry a simple peasant girl?"\r\n\r\nSuddenly when we were at our very busiest, I got a letter with the\r\nItalian stamp, and the clover and the beehives and the calves and\r\nthe peasant girl all floated away like smoke. This time Ariadne\r\nwrote that she was profoundly, infinitely unhappy. She reproached\r\nme for not holding out a helping hand to her, for looking down upon\r\nher from the heights of my virtue and deserting her at the moment\r\nof danger. All this was written in a large, nervous handwriting\r\nwith blots and smudges, and it was evident that she wrote in haste\r\nand distress. In conclusion she besought me to come and save her.\r\nAgain my anchor was hauled up and I was carried away. Ariadne was\r\nin Rome. I arrived late in the evening, and when she saw me, she\r\nsobbed and threw herself on my neck. She had not changed at all\r\nthat winter, and was just as young and charming. We had supper\r\ntogether and afterwards drove about Rome until dawn, and all the\r\ntime she kept telling me about her doings. I asked where Lubkov\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t remind me of that creature!" she cried. "He is loathsome and\r\ndisgusting to me!"\r\n\r\n"But I thought you loved him," I said.\r\n\r\n"Never," she said. "At first he struck me as original and aroused\r\nmy pity, that was all. He is insolent and takes a woman by storm.\r\nAnd that\'s attractive. But we won\'t talk about him. That is a\r\nmelancholy page in my life. He has gone to Russia to get money.\r\nServe him right! I told him not to dare to come back."\r\n\r\nShe was living then, not at an hotel, but in a private lodging of\r\ntwo rooms which she had decorated in her own taste, frigidly and\r\nluxuriously.\r\n\r\nAfter Lubkov had gone away she had borrowed from her acquaintances\r\nabout five thousand francs, and my arrival certainly was the one\r\nsalvation for her.\r\n\r\nI had reckoned on taking her back to the country, but I did not\r\nsucceed in that. She was homesick for her native place, but her\r\nrecollections of the poverty she had been through there, of privations,\r\nof the rusty roof on her brother\'s house, roused a shudder of\r\ndisgust, and when I suggested going home to her, she squeezed my\r\nhands convulsively and said:\r\n\r\n"No, no, I shall die of boredom there!"\r\n\r\nThen my love entered upon its final phase.\r\n\r\n"Be the darling that you used to be; love me a little," said Ariadne,\r\nbending over to me. "You\'re sulky and prudent, you\'re afraid to\r\nyield to impulse, and keep thinking of consequences, and that\'s\r\ndull. Come, I beg you, I beseech you, be nice to me! . . . My pure\r\none, my holy one, my dear one, I love you so!"\r\n\r\nI became her lover. For a month anyway I was like a madman, conscious\r\nof nothing but rapture. To hold in one\'s arms a young and lovely\r\nbody, with bliss to feel her warmth every time one waked up from\r\nsleep, and to remember that she was there--she, my Ariadne!--\r\noh, it was not easy to get used to that! But yet I did get used to\r\nit, and by degrees became capable of reflecting on my new position.\r\nFirst of all, I realised, as before, that Ariadne did not love me.\r\nBut she wanted to be really in love, she was afraid of solitude,\r\nand, above all, I was healthy, young, vigorous; she was sensual,\r\nlike all cold people, as a rule--and we both made a show of being\r\nunited by a passionate, mutual love. Afterwards I realised something\r\nelse, too.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in Rome, in Naples, in Florence; we went to Paris, but\r\nthere we thought it cold and went back to Italy. We introduced\r\nourselves everywhere as husband and wife, wealthy landowners. People\r\nreadily made our acquaintance and Ariadne had great social success\r\neverywhere. As she took lessons in painting, she was called an\r\nartist, and only imagine, that quite suited her, though she had not\r\nthe slightest trace of talent.\r\n\r\nShe would sleep every day till two or three o\'clock; she had her\r\ncoffee and lunch in bed. At dinner she would eat soup, lobster,\r\nfish, meat, asparagus, game, and after she had gone to bed I used\r\nto bring up something, for instance roast beef, and she would eat\r\nit with a melancholy, careworn expression, and if she waked in the\r\nnight she would eat apples and oranges.\r\n\r\nThe chief, so to say fundamental, characteristic of the woman was\r\nan amazing duplicity. She was continually deceitful every minute,\r\napparently apart from any necessity, as it were by instinct, by an\r\nimpulse such as makes the sparrow chirrup and the cockroach waggle\r\nits antenn\xe6. She was deceitful with me, with the footman, with the\r\nporter, with the tradesmen in the shops, with her acquaintances;\r\nnot one conversation, not one meeting, took place without affectation\r\nand pretence. A man had only to come into our room--whoever it\r\nmight be, a waiter, or a baron--for her eyes, her expression, her\r\nvoice to change, even the contour of her figure was transformed.\r\nAt the very first glance at her then, you would have said there\r\nwere no more wealthy and fashionable people in Italy than we. She\r\nnever met an artist or a musician without telling him all sorts of\r\nlies about his remarkable talent.\r\n\r\n"You have such a talent!" she would say, in honeyed cadences, "I\'m\r\nreally afraid of you. I think you must see right through people."\r\n\r\nAnd all this simply in order to please, to be successful, to be\r\nfascinating! She waked up every morning with the one thought of\r\n"pleasing"! It was the aim and object of her life. If I had told\r\nher that in such a house, in such a street, there lived a man who\r\nwas not attracted by her, it would have caused her real suffering.\r\nShe wanted every day to enchant, to captivate, to drive men crazy.\r\nThe fact that I was in her power and reduced to a complete nonentity\r\nbefore her charms gave her the same sort of satisfaction that\r\nvisitors used to feel in tournaments. My subjection was not enough,\r\nand at nights, stretched out like a tigress, uncovered--she was\r\nalways too hot--she would read the letters sent her by Lubkov;\r\nhe besought her to return to Russia, vowing if she did not he would\r\nrob or murder some one to get the money to come to her. She hated\r\nhim, but his passionate, slavish letters excited her. She had an\r\nextraordinary opinion of her own charms; she imagined that if\r\nsomewhere, in some great assembly, men could have seen how beautifully\r\nshe was made and the colour of her skin, she would have vanquished\r\nall Italy, the whole world. Her talk of her figure, of her skin,\r\noffended me, and observing this, she would, when she was angry, to\r\nvex me, say all sorts of vulgar things, taunting me. One day when\r\nwe were at the summer villa of a lady of our acquaintance, and she\r\nlost her temper, she even went so far as to say: "If you don\'t leave\r\noff boring me with your sermons, I\'ll undress this minute and lie\r\nnaked here on these flowers."\r\n\r\nOften looking at her asleep, or eating, or trying to assume a na\xefve\r\nexpression, I wondered why that extraordinary beauty, grace, and\r\nintelligence had been given her by God. Could it simply be for\r\nlolling in bed, eating and lying, lying endlessly? And was she\r\nintelligent really? She was afraid of three candles in a row, of\r\nthe number thirteen, was terrified of spells and bad dreams. She\r\nargued about free love and freedom in general like a bigoted old\r\nwoman, declared that Boleslav Markevitch was a better writer than\r\nTurgenev. But she was diabolically cunning and sharp, and knew how\r\nto seem a highly educated, advanced person in company.\r\n\r\nEven at a good-humoured moment, she could always insult a servant\r\nor kill an insect without a pang; she liked bull-fights, liked to\r\nread about murders, and was angry when prisoners were acquitted.\r\n\r\nFor the life Ariadne and I were leading, we had to have a great\r\ndeal of money. My poor father sent me his pension, all the little\r\nsums he received, borrowed for me wherever he could, and when one\r\nday he answered me: "Non habeo," I sent him a desperate telegram\r\nin which I besought him to mortgage the estate. A little later I\r\nbegged him to get money somehow on a second mortgage. He did this\r\ntoo without a murmur and sent me every farthing. Ariadne despised\r\nthe practical side of life; all this was no concern of hers, and\r\nwhen flinging away thousands of francs to satisfy her mad desires\r\nI groaned like an old tree, she would be singing "Addio bella Napoli"\r\nwith a light heart.\r\n\r\nLittle by little I grew cold to her and began to be ashamed of our\r\ntie. I am not fond of pregnancy and confinements, but now I sometimes\r\ndreamed of a child who would have been at least a formal justification\r\nof our life. That I might not be completely disgusted with myself,\r\nI began reading and visiting museums and galleries, gave up drinking\r\nand took to eating very little. If one keeps oneself well in hand\r\nfrom morning to night, one\'s heart seems lighter. I began to bore\r\nAriadne too. The people with whom she won her triumphs were, by the\r\nway, all of the middling sort; as before, there were no ambassadors,\r\nthere was no salon, the money did not run to it, and this mortified\r\nher and made her sob, and she announced to me at last that perhaps\r\nshe would not be against our returning to Russia.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are on our way. For the last few months she has been\r\nzealously corresponding with her brother; she evidently has some\r\nsecret projects, but what they are--God knows! I am sick of trying\r\nto fathom her underhand schemes! But we\'re going, not to the country,\r\nbut to Yalta and afterwards to the Caucasus. She can only exist now\r\nat watering-places, and if you knew how I hate all these watering-places,\r\nhow suffocated and ashamed I am in them. If I could be in the country\r\nnow! If I could only be working now, earning my bread by the sweat\r\nof my brow, atoning for my follies. I am conscious of a superabundance\r\nof energy and I believe that if I were to put that energy to work\r\nI could redeem my estate in five years. But now, as you see, there\r\nis a complication. Here we\'re not abroad, but in mother Russia; we\r\nshall have to think of lawful wedlock. Of course, all attraction\r\nis over; there is no trace left of my old love, but, however that\r\nmay be, I am bound in honour to marry her.\r\n\r\n                             ----\r\n\r\nShamohin, excited by his story, went below with me and we continued\r\ntalking about women. It was late. It appeared that he and I were\r\nin the same cabin.\r\n\r\n"So far it is only in the village that woman has not fallen behind\r\nman," said Shamohin. "There she thinks and feels just as man does,\r\nand struggles with nature in the name of culture as zealously as\r\nhe. In the towns the woman of the bourgeois or intellectual class\r\nhas long since fallen behind, and is returning to her primitive\r\ncondition. She is half a human beast already, and, thanks to her,\r\na great deal of what had been won by human genius has been lost\r\nagain; the woman gradually disappears and in her place is the\r\nprimitive female. This dropping-back on the part of the educated\r\nwoman is a real danger to culture; in her retrogressive movement\r\nshe tries to drag man after her and prevents him from moving forward.\r\nThat is incontestable."\r\n\r\nI asked: "Why generalise? Why judge of all women from Ariadne alone?\r\nThe very struggle of women for education and sexual equality, which\r\nI look upon as a struggle for justice, precludes any hypothesis of\r\na retrograde movement."\r\n\r\nBut Shamohin scarcely listened to me and he smiled distrustfully.\r\nHe was a passionate, convinced misogynist, and it was impossible\r\nto alter his convictions.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense!" he interrupted. "When once a woman sees in me, not\r\na man, not an equal, but a male, and her one anxiety all her life\r\nis to attract me--that is, to take possession of me--how can\r\none talk of their rights? Oh, don\'t you believe them; they are very,\r\nvery cunning! We men make a great stir about their emancipation,\r\nbut they don\'t care about their emancipation at all, they only\r\npretend to care about it; they are horribly cunning things, horribly\r\ncunning!"\r\n\r\nI began to feel sleepy and weary of discussion. I turned over with\r\nmy face to the wall.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I heard as I fell asleep--"yes, and it\'s our education\r\nthat\'s at fault, sir. In our towns, the whole education and bringing\r\nup of women in its essence tends to develop her into the human beast\r\n--that is, to make her attractive to the male and able to vanquish\r\nhim. Yes, indeed"--Shamohiri sighed--"little girls ought to be\r\ntaught and brought up with boys, so that they might be always\r\ntogether. A woman ought to be trained so that she may be able, like\r\na man, to recognise when she\'s wrong, or she always thinks she\'s\r\nin the right. Instil into a little girl from her cradle that a man\r\nis not first of all a cavalier or a possible lover, but her neighbour,\r\nher equal in everything. Train her to think logically, to generalise,\r\nand do not assure her that her brain weighs less than a man\'s and\r\nthat therefore she can be indifferent to the sciences, to the arts,\r\nto the tasks of culture in general. The apprentice to the shoemaker\r\nor the house painter has a brain of smaller size than the grown-up\r\nman too, yet he works, suffers, takes his part in the general\r\nstruggle for existence. We must give up our attitude to the\r\nphysiological aspect, too--to pregnancy and childbirth, seeing\r\nthat in the first place women don\'t have babies every month; secondly,\r\nnot all women have babies; and, thirdly, a normal countrywoman works\r\nin the fields up to the day of her confinement and it does her no\r\nharm. Then there ought to be absolute equality in everyday life.\r\nIf a man gives a lady his chair or picks up the handkerchief she\r\nhas dropped, let her repay him in the same way. I have no objection\r\nif a girl of good family helps me to put on my coat or hands me a\r\nglass of water--"\r\n\r\nI heard no more, for I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning when we were approaching Sevastopol, it was damp,\r\nunpleasant weather; the ship rocked. Shamohin sat on deck with me,\r\nbrooding and silent. When the bell rang for tea, men with their\r\ncoat-collars turned up and ladies with pale, sleepy faces began\r\ngoing below; a young and very beautiful lady, the one who had been\r\nso angry with the Customs officers at Volotchisk, stopped before\r\nShamohin and said with the expression of a naughty, fretful child:\r\n\r\n"Jean, your birdie\'s been sea-sick."\r\n\r\nAfterwards when I was at Yalta I saw the same beautiful lady dashing\r\nabout on horseback with a couple of officers hardly able to keep\r\nup with her. And one morning I saw her in an overall and a Phrygian\r\ncap, sketching on the sea-front with a great crowd admiring her a\r\nlittle way off. I too was introduced to her. She pressed my hand\r\nwith great warmth, and looking at me ecstatically, thanked me in\r\nhoneyed cadences for the pleasure I had given her by my writings.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe her," Shamohin whispered to me, "she has never\r\nread a word of them."\r\n\r\nWhen I was walking on the sea-front in the early evening Shamohin\r\nmet me with his arms full of big parcels of fruits and dainties.\r\n\r\n"Prince Maktuev is here!" he said joyfully. "He came yesterday with\r\nher brother, the spiritualist! Now I understand what she was writing\r\nto him about! Oh, Lord!" he went on, gazing up to heaven, and\r\npressing his parcels to his bosom. "If she hits it off with the\r\nprince, it means freedom, then I can go back to the country with\r\nmy father!"\r\n\r\nAnd he ran on.\r\n\r\n"I begin to believe in spirits," he called to me, looking back.\r\n"The spirit of grandfather Ilarion seems to have prophesied the\r\ntruth! Oh, if only it is so!"\r\n\r\n                             ----\r\n\r\nThe day after this meeting I left Yalta and how Shamohin\'s story\r\nended I don\'t know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLINKA\r\n\r\nIT is one o\'clock in the afternoon. Shopping is at its height at\r\nthe "Nouveaut\xe9\'s de Paris," a drapery establishment in one of the\r\nArcades. There is a monotonous hum of shopmen\'s voices, the hum one\r\nhears at school when the teacher sets the boys to learn something\r\nby heart. This regular sound is not interrupted by the laughter of\r\nlady customers nor the slam of the glass door, nor the scurrying\r\nof the boys.\r\n\r\nPolinka, a thin fair little person whose mother is the head of a\r\ndressmaking establishment, is standing in the middle of the shop\r\nlooking about for some one. A dark-browed boy runs up to her and\r\nasks, looking at her very gravely:\r\n\r\n"What is your pleasure, madam?"\r\n\r\n"Nikolay Timofeitch always takes my order," answers Polinka.\r\n\r\nNikolay Timofeitch, a graceful dark young man, fashionably dressed,\r\nwith frizzled hair and a big pin in his cravat, has already cleared\r\na place on the counter and is craning forward, looking at Polinka\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n"Morning, Pelagea Sergeevna!" he cries in a pleasant, hearty baritone\r\nvoice. "What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Good-morning!" says Polinka, going up to him. "You see, I\'m back\r\nagain. . . . Show me some gimp, please."\r\n\r\n"Gimp--for what purpose?"\r\n\r\n"For a bodice trimming--to trim a whole dress, in fact."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\nNickolay Timofeitch lays several kinds of gimp before Polinka; she\r\nlooks at the trimmings languidly and begins bargaining over them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, a rouble\'s not dear," says the shopman persuasively,\r\nwith a condescending smile. "It\'s a French trimming, pure silk. . . .\r\nWe have a commoner sort, if you like, heavier. That\'s forty-five\r\nkopecks a yard; of course, it\'s nothing like the same quality."\r\n\r\n"I want a bead corselet, too, with gimp buttons," says Polinka,\r\nbending over the gimp and sighing for some reason. "And have you\r\nany bead motifs to match?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nPolinka bends still lower over the counter and asks softly:\r\n\r\n"And why did you leave us so early on Thursday, Nikolay Timofeitch?"\r\n\r\n"Hm! It\'s queer you noticed it," says the shopman, with a smirk.\r\n"You were so taken up with that fine student that . . . it\'s queer\r\nyou noticed it!"\r\n\r\nPolinka flushes crimson and remains mute. With a nervous quiver in\r\nhis fingers the shopman closes the boxes, and for no sort of object\r\npiles them one on the top of another. A moment of silence follows.\r\n\r\n"I want some bead lace, too," says Polinka, lifting her eyes guiltily\r\nto the shopman.\r\n\r\n"What sort? Black or coloured? Bead lace on tulle is the most\r\nfashionable trimming."\r\n\r\n"And how much is it?"\r\n\r\n"The black\'s from eighty kopecks and the coloured from two and a\r\nhalf roubles. I shall never come and see you again," Nikolay\r\nTimofeitch adds in an undertone.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Why? It\'s very simple. You must understand that yourself. Why\r\nshould I distress myself? It\'s a queer business! Do you suppose\r\nit\'s a pleasure to me to see that student carrying on with you? I\r\nsee it all and I understand. Ever since autumn he\'s been hanging\r\nabout you and you go for a walk with him almost every day; and when\r\nhe is with you, you gaze at him as though he were an angel. You are\r\nin love with him; there\'s no one to beat him in your eyes. Well,\r\nall right, then, it\'s no good talking."\r\n\r\nPolinka remains dumb and moves her finger on the counter in\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n"I see it all," the shopman goes on. "What inducement have I to\r\ncome and see you? I\'ve got some pride. It\'s not every one likes to\r\nplay gooseberry. What was it you asked for?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma told me to get a lot of things, but I\'ve forgotten. I want\r\nsome feather trimming too."\r\n\r\n"What kind would you like?"\r\n\r\n"The best, something fashionable."\r\n\r\n"The most fashionable now are real bird feathers. If you want the\r\nmost fashionable colour, it\'s heliotrope or _kanak_--that is,\r\nclaret with a yellow shade in it. We have an immense choice. And\r\nwhat all this affair is going to lead to, I really don\'t understand.\r\nHere you are in love, and how is it to end?"\r\n\r\nPatches of red come into Nikolay Timofeitch\'s face round his eyes.\r\nHe crushes the soft feather trimming in his hand and goes on\r\nmuttering:\r\n\r\n"Do you imagine he\'ll marry you--is that it? You\'d better drop\r\nany such fancies. Students are forbidden to marry. And do you suppose\r\nhe comes to see you with honourable intentions? A likely idea! Why,\r\nthese fine students don\'t look on us as human beings . . . they\r\nonly go to see shopkeepers and dressmakers to laugh at their ignorance\r\nand to drink. They\'re ashamed to drink at home and in good houses,\r\nbut with simple uneducated people like us they don\'t care what any\r\none thinks; they\'d be ready to stand on their heads. Yes! Well,\r\nwhich feather trimming will you take? And if he hangs about and\r\ncarries on with you, we know what he is after. . . . When he\'s a\r\ndoctor or a lawyer he\'ll remember you: \'Ah,\' he\'ll say, \'I used to\r\nhave a pretty fair little thing! I wonder where she is now?\' Even\r\nnow I bet you he boasts among his friends that he\'s got his eye on\r\na little dressmaker."\r\n\r\nPolinka sits down and gazes pensively at the pile of white boxes.\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t take the feather trimming," she sighs. "Mamma had\r\nbetter choose it for herself; I may get the wrong one. I want six\r\nyards of fringe for an overcoat, at forty kopecks the yard. For the\r\nsame coat I want cocoa-nut buttons, perforated, so they can be sown\r\non firmly. . . ."\r\n\r\nNikolay Timofeitch wraps up the fringe and the buttons. She looks\r\nat him guiltily and evidently expects him to go on talking, but he\r\nremains sullenly silent while he tidies up the feather trimming.\r\n\r\n"I mustn\'t forget some buttons for a dressing-gown . . ." she says\r\nafter an interval of silence, wiping her pale lips with a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"What kind?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s for a shopkeeper\'s wife, so give me something rather striking."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if it\'s for a shopkeeper\'s wife, you\'d better have something\r\nbright. Here are some buttons. A combination of colours--red,\r\nblue, and the fashionable gold shade. Very glaring. The more refined\r\nprefer dull black with a bright border. But I don\'t understand.\r\nCan\'t you see for yourself? What can these . . . walks lead to?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," whispers Polinka, and she bends over the buttons;\r\n"I don\'t know myself what\'s come to me, Nikolay Timofeitch."\r\n\r\nA solid shopman with whiskers forces his way behind Nikolay\r\nTimofeitch\'s back, squeezing him to the counter, and beaming with\r\nthe choicest gallantry, shouts:\r\n\r\n"Be so kind, madam, as to step into this department. We have three\r\nkinds of jerseys: plain, braided, and trimmed with beads! Which may\r\nI have the pleasure of showing you?"\r\n\r\nAt the same time a stout lady passes by Polinka, pronouncing in a\r\nrich, deep voice, almost a bass:\r\n\r\n"They must be seamless, with the trade mark stamped in them, please."\r\n\r\n"Pretend to be looking at the things," Nikolay Timofeitch whispers,\r\nbending down to Polinka with a forced smile. "Dear me, you do look\r\npale and ill; you are quite changed. He\'ll throw you over, Pelagea\r\nSergeevna! Or if he does marry you, it won\'t be for love but from\r\nhunger; he\'ll be tempted by your money. He\'ll furnish himself a\r\nnice home with your dowry, and then be ashamed of you. He\'ll keep\r\nyou out of sight of his friends and visitors, because you\'re\r\nuneducated. He\'ll call you \'my dummy of a wife.\' You wouldn\'t know\r\nhow to behave in a doctor\'s or lawyer\'s circle. To them you\'re a\r\ndressmaker, an ignorant creature."\r\n\r\n"Nikolay Timofeitch!" somebody shouts from the other end of the\r\nshop. "The young lady here wants three yards of ribbon with a metal\r\nstripe. Have we any?"\r\n\r\nNikolay Timofeitch turns in that direction, smirks and shouts:\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have! Ribbon with a metal stripe, ottoman with a satin\r\nstripe, and satin with a moir\xe9 stripe!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, by the way, I mustn\'t forget, Olga asked me to get her a pair\r\nof stays!" says Polinka.\r\n\r\n"There are tears in your eyes," says Nikolay Timofeitch in dismay.\r\n"What\'s that for? Come to the corset department, I\'ll screen you\r\n--it looks awkward."\r\n\r\nWith a forced smile and exaggeratedly free and easy manner, the\r\nshopman rapidly conducts Polinka to the corset department and\r\nconceals her from the public eye behind a high pyramid of boxes.\r\n\r\n"What sort of corset may I show you?" he asks aloud, whispering\r\nimmediately: "Wipe your eyes!"\r\n\r\n"I want . . . I want . . . size forty-eight centimetres. Only she\r\nwanted one, lined . . . with real whalebone . . . I must talk to\r\nyou, Nikolay Timofeitch. Come to-day!"\r\n\r\n"Talk? What about? There\'s nothing to talk about."\r\n\r\n"You are the only person who . . . cares about me, and I\'ve no one\r\nto talk to but you."\r\n\r\n"These are not reed or steel, but real whalebone. . . . What is\r\nthere for us to talk about? It\'s no use talking. . . . You are going\r\nfor a walk with him to-day, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I . . . I am."\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s the use of talking? Talk won\'t help. . . . You are in\r\nlove, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes . . ." Polinka whispers hesitatingly, and big tears gush from\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n"What is there to say?" mutters Nikolay Timofeitch, shrugging his\r\nshoulders nervously and turning pale. "There\'s no need of talk. . . .\r\nWipe your eyes, that\'s all. I . . . I ask for nothing."\r\n\r\nAt that moment a tall, lanky shopman comes up to the pyramid of\r\nboxes, and says to his customer:\r\n\r\n"Let me show you some good elastic garters that do not impede the\r\ncirculation, certified by medical authority . . ."\r\n\r\nNikolay Timofeitch screens Polinka, and, trying to conceal her\r\nemotion and his own, wrinkles his face into a smile and says aloud:\r\n\r\n"There are two kinds of lace, madam: cotton and silk! Oriental,\r\nEnglish, Valenciennes, crochet, torchon, are cotton. And rococo,\r\nsoutache, Cambray, are silk. . . . For God\'s sake, wipe your eyes!\r\nThey\'re coming this way!"\r\n\r\nAnd seeing that her tears are still gushing he goes on louder than\r\never:\r\n\r\n"Spanish, Rococo, soutache, Cambray . . . stockings, thread, cotton,\r\nsilk . . ."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANYUTA\r\n\r\nIN the cheapest room of a big block of furnished apartments Stepan\r\nKlotchkov, a medical student in his third year, was walking to and\r\nfro, zealously conning his anatomy. His mouth was dry and his\r\nforehead perspiring from the unceasing effort to learn it by heart.\r\n\r\nIn the window, covered by patterns of frost, sat on a stool the\r\ngirl who shared his room--Anyuta, a thin little brunette of\r\nfive-and-twenty, very pale with mild grey eyes. Sitting with bent\r\nback she was busy embroidering with red thread the collar of a man\'s\r\nshirt. She was working against time. . . . The clock in the passage\r\nstruck two drowsily, yet the little room had not been put to rights\r\nfor the morning. Crumpled bed-clothes, pillows thrown about, books,\r\nclothes, a big filthy slop-pail filled with soap-suds in which\r\ncigarette ends were swimming, and the litter on the floor--all\r\nseemed as though purposely jumbled together in one confusion. . . .\r\n\r\n"The right lung consists of three parts . . ." Klotchkov repeated.\r\n"Boundaries! Upper part on anterior wall of thorax reaches the\r\nfourth or fifth rib, on the lateral surface, the fourth rib . . .\r\nbehind to the _spina scapul\xe6_. . ."\r\n\r\nKlotchkov raised his eyes to the ceiling, striving to visualise\r\nwhat he had just read. Unable to form a clear picture of it, he\r\nbegan feeling his upper ribs through his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n"These ribs are like the keys of a piano," he said. "One must\r\nfamiliarise oneself with them somehow, if one is not to get muddled\r\nover them. One must study them in the skeleton and the living body\r\n. . . . I say, Anyuta, let me pick them out."\r\n\r\nAnyuta put down her sewing, took off her blouse, and straightened\r\nherself up. Klotchkov sat down facing her, frowned, and began\r\ncounting her ribs.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . One can\'t feel the first rib; it\'s behind the shoulder-blade\r\n. . . . This must be the second rib. . . . Yes . . . this is the third\r\n. . . this is the fourth. . . . H\'m! . . . yes. . . . Why are you\r\nwriggling?"\r\n\r\n"Your fingers are cold!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come . . . it won\'t kill you. Don\'t twist about. That must\r\nbe the third rib, then . . . this is the fourth. . . . You look\r\nsuch a skinny thing, and yet one can hardly feel your ribs. That\'s\r\nthe second . . . that\'s the third. . . . Oh, this is muddling, and\r\none can\'t see it clearly. . . . I must draw it. . . . Where\'s my\r\ncrayon?"\r\n\r\nKlotchkov took his crayon and drew on Anyuta\'s chest several parallel\r\nlines corresponding with the ribs.\r\n\r\n"First-rate. That\'s all straightforward. . . . Well, now I can sound\r\nyou. Stand up!"\r\n\r\nAnyuta stood up and raised her chin. Klotchkov began sounding her,\r\nand was so absorbed in this occupation that he did not notice how\r\nAnyuta\'s lips, nose, and fingers turned blue with cold. Anyuta\r\nshivered, and was afraid the student, noticing it, would leave off\r\ndrawing and sounding her, and then, perhaps, might fail in his exam.\r\n\r\n"Now it\'s all clear," said Klotchkov when he had finished. "You sit\r\nlike that and don\'t rub off the crayon, and meanwhile I\'ll learn\r\nup a little more."\r\n\r\nAnd the student again began walking to and fro, repeating to himself.\r\nAnyuta, with black stripes across her chest, looking as though she\r\nhad been tattooed, sat thinking, huddled up and shivering with cold.\r\nShe said very little as a rule; she was always silent, thinking and\r\nthinking. . . .\r\n\r\nIn the six or seven years of her wanderings from one furnished room\r\nto another, she had known five students like Klotchkov. Now they\r\nhad all finished their studies, had gone out into the world, and,\r\nof course, like respectable people, had long ago forgotten her. One\r\nof them was living in Paris, two were doctors, the fourth was an\r\nartist, and the fifth was said to be already a professor. Klotchkov\r\nwas the sixth. . . . Soon he, too, would finish his studies and go\r\nout into the world. There was a fine future before him, no doubt,\r\nand Klotchkov probably would become a great man, but the present\r\nwas anything but bright; Klotchkov had no tobacco and no tea, and\r\nthere were only four lumps of sugar left. She must make haste and\r\nfinish her embroidery, take it to the woman who had ordered it, and\r\nwith the quarter rouble she would get for it, buy tea and tobacco.\r\n\r\n"Can I come in?" asked a voice at the door.\r\n\r\nAnyuta quickly threw a woollen shawl over her shoulders. Fetisov,\r\nthe artist, walked in.\r\n\r\n"I have come to ask you a favour," he began, addressing Klotchkov,\r\nand glaring like a wild beast from under the long locks that hung\r\nover his brow. "Do me a favour; lend me your young lady just for a\r\ncouple of hours! I\'m painting a picture, you see, and I can\'t get\r\non without a model."\r\n\r\n"Oh, with pleasure," Klotchkov agreed. "Go along, Anyuta."\r\n\r\n"The things I\'ve had to put up with there," Anyuta murmured softly.\r\n\r\n"Rubbish! The man\'s asking you for the sake of art, and not for any\r\nsort of nonsense. Why not help him if you can?"\r\n\r\nAnyuta began dressing.\r\n\r\n"And what are you painting?" asked Klotchkov.\r\n\r\n"Psyche; it\'s a fine subject. But it won\'t go, somehow. I have to\r\nkeep painting from different models. Yesterday I was painting one\r\nwith blue legs. \'Why are your legs blue?\' I asked her. \'It\'s my\r\nstockings stain them,\' she said. And you\'re still grinding! Lucky\r\nfellow! You have patience."\r\n\r\n"Medicine\'s a job one can\'t get on with without grinding."\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . Excuse me, Klotchkov, but you do live like a pig! It\'s\r\nawful the way you live!"\r\n\r\n"How do you mean? I can\'t help it. . . . I only get twelve roubles\r\na month from my father, and it\'s hard to live decently on that."\r\n\r\n"Yes . . . yes . . ." said the artist, frowning with an air of\r\ndisgust; "but, still, you might live better. . . . An educated man\r\nis in duty bound to have taste, isn\'t he? And goodness knows what\r\nit\'s like here! The bed not made, the slops, the dirt . . . yesterday\'s\r\nporridge in the plates. . . Tfoo!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said the student in confusion; "but Anyuta has had\r\nno time to-day to tidy up; she\'s been busy all the while."\r\n\r\nWhen Anyuta and the artist had gone out Klotchkov lay down on the\r\nsofa and began learning, lying down; then he accidentally dropped\r\nasleep, and waking up an hour later, propped his head on his fists\r\nand sank into gloomy reflection. He recalled the artist\'s words\r\nthat an educated man was in duty bound to have taste, and his\r\nsurroundings actually struck him now as loathsome and revolting.\r\nHe saw, as it were in his mind\'s eye, his own future, when he would\r\nsee his patients in his consulting-room, drink tea in a large\r\ndining-room in the company of his wife, a real lady. And now that\r\nslop-pail in which the cigarette ends were swimming looked incredibly\r\ndisgusting. Anyuta, too, rose before his imagination--a plain,\r\nslovenly, pitiful figure . . . and he made up his mind to part with\r\nher at once, at all costs.\r\n\r\nWhen, on coming back from the artist\'s, she took off her coat, he\r\ngot up and said to her seriously:\r\n\r\n"Look here, my good girl . . . sit down and listen. We must part!\r\nThe fact is, I don\'t want to live with you any longer."\r\n\r\nAnyuta had come back from the artist\'s worn out and exhausted.\r\nStanding so long as a model had made her face look thin and sunken,\r\nand her chin sharper than ever. She said nothing in answer to the\r\nstudent\'s words, only her lips began to tremble.\r\n\r\n"You know we should have to part sooner or later, anyway," said the\r\nstudent. "You\'re a nice, good girl, and not a fool; you\'ll\r\nunderstand. . . ."\r\n\r\nAnyuta put on her coat again, in silence wrapped up her embroidery\r\nin paper, gathered together her needles and thread: she found the\r\nscrew of paper with the four lumps of sugar in the window, and laid\r\nit on the table by the books.\r\n\r\n"That\'s . . . your sugar . . ." she said softly, and turned away\r\nto conceal her tears.\r\n\r\n"Why are you crying?" asked Klotchkov.\r\n\r\nHe walked about the room in confusion, and said:\r\n\r\n"You are a strange girl, really. . . . Why, you know we shall have\r\nto part. We can\'t stay together for ever."\r\n\r\nShe had gathered together all her belongings, and turned to say\r\ngood-bye to him, and he felt sorry for her.\r\n\r\n"Shall I let her stay on here another week?" he thought. "She really\r\nmay as well stay, and I\'ll tell her to go in a week;" and vexed at\r\nhis own weakness, he shouted to her roughly:\r\n\r\n"Come, why are you standing there? If you are going, go; and if you\r\ndon\'t want to, take off your coat and stay! You can stay!"\r\n\r\nAnyuta took off her coat, silently, stealthily, then blew her nose\r\nalso stealthily, sighed, and noiselessly returned to her invariable\r\nposition on her stool by the window.\r\n\r\nThe student drew his textbook to him and began again pacing from\r\ncorner to corner. "The right lung consists of three parts," he\r\nrepeated; "the upper part, on anterior wall of thorax, reaches the\r\nfourth or fifth rib . . . ."\r\n\r\nIn the passage some one shouted at the top of his voice: "Grigory!\r\nThe samovar!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO VOLODYAS\r\n\r\n"LET me; I want to drive myself! I\'ll sit by the driver!" Sofya\r\nLvovna said in a loud voice. "Wait a minute, driver; I\'ll get up\r\non the box beside you."\r\n\r\nShe stood up in the sledge, and her husband, Vladimir Nikititch,\r\nand the friend of her childhood, Vladimir Mihalovitch, held her\r\narms to prevent her falling. The three horses were galloping fast.\r\n\r\n"I said you ought not to have given her brandy," Vladimir Nikititch\r\nwhispered to his companion with vexation. "What a fellow you are,\r\nreally!"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel knew by experience that in women like his wife, Sofya\r\nLvovna, after a little too much wine, turbulent gaiety was followed\r\nby hysterical laughter and then tears. He was afraid that when they\r\ngot home, instead of being able to sleep, he would have to be\r\nadministering compresses and drops.\r\n\r\n"Wo!" cried Sofya Lvovna. "I want to drive myself!"\r\n\r\nShe felt genuinely gay and triumphant. For the last two months,\r\never since her wedding, she had been tortured by the thought that\r\nshe had married Colonel Yagitch from worldly motives and, as it is\r\nsaid, _par d\xe9pit_; but that evening, at the restaurant, she had\r\nsuddenly become convinced that she loved him passionately. In spite\r\nof his fifty-four years, he was so slim, agile, supple, he made\r\npuns and hummed to the gipsies\' tunes so charmingly. Really, the\r\nolder men were nowadays a thousand times more interesting than the\r\nyoung. It seemed as though age and youth had changed parts. The\r\nColonel was two years older than her father, but could there be any\r\nimportance in that if, honestly speaking, there were infinitely\r\nmore vitality, go, and freshness in him than in herself, though she\r\nwas only twenty-three?\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling!" she thought. "You are wonderful!"\r\n\r\nShe had become convinced in the restaurant, too, that not a spark\r\nof her old feeling remained. For the friend of her childhood,\r\nVladimir Mihalovitch, or simply Volodya, with whom only the day\r\nbefore she had been madly, miserably in love, she now felt nothing\r\nbut complete indifference. All that evening he had seemed to her\r\nspiritless, torpid, uninteresting, and insignificant, and the\r\n_sangfroid_ with which he habitually avoided paying at restaurants\r\non this occasion revolted her, and she had hardly been able to\r\nresist saying, "If you are poor, you should stay at home." The\r\nColonel paid for all.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because trees, telegraph posts, and drifts of snow kept\r\nflitting past her eyes, all sorts of disconnected ideas came rushing\r\ninto her mind. She reflected: the bill at the restaurant had been\r\na hundred and twenty roubles, and a hundred had gone to the gipsies,\r\nand to-morrow she could fling away a thousand roubles if she liked;\r\nand only two months ago, before her wedding, she had not had three\r\nroubles of her own, and had to ask her father for every trifle.\r\nWhat a change in her life!\r\n\r\nHer thoughts were in a tangle. She recalled, how, when she was a\r\nchild of ten, Colonel Yagitch, now her husband, used to make love\r\nto her aunt, and every one in the house said that he had ruined\r\nher. And her aunt had, in fact, often come down to dinner with her\r\neyes red from crying, and was always going off somewhere; and people\r\nused to say of her that the poor thing could find no peace anywhere.\r\nHe had been very handsome in those days, and had an extraordinary\r\nreputation as a lady-killer. So much so that he was known all over\r\nthe town, and it was said of him that he paid a round of visits to\r\nhis adorers every day like a doctor visiting his patients. And even\r\nnow, in spite of his grey hair, his wrinkles, and his spectacles,\r\nhis thin face looked handsome, especially in profile.\r\n\r\nSofya Lvovna\'s father was an army doctor, and had at one time served\r\nin the same regiment with Colonel Yagitch. Volodya\'s father was an\r\narmy doctor too, and he, too, had once been in the same regiment\r\nas her father and Colonel Yagitch. In spite of many amatory adventures,\r\noften very complicated and disturbing, Volodya had done splendidly\r\nat the university, and had taken a very good degree. Now he was\r\nspecialising in foreign literature, and was said to be writing a\r\nthesis. He lived with his father, the army doctor, in the barracks,\r\nand had no means of his own, though he was thirty. As children Sofya\r\nand he had lived under the same roof, though in different flats.\r\nHe often came to play with her, and they had dancing and French\r\nlessons together. But when he grew up into a graceful, remarkably\r\nhandsome young man, she began to feel shy of him, and then fell\r\nmadly in love with him, and had loved him right up to the time when\r\nshe was married to Yagitch. He, too, had been renowned for his\r\nsuccess with women almost from the age of fourteen, and the ladies\r\nwho deceived their husbands on his account excused themselves by\r\nsaying that he was only a boy. Some one had told a story of him\r\nlately that when he was a student living in lodgings so as to be\r\nnear the university, it always happened if one knocked at his door,\r\nthat one heard his footstep, and then a whispered apology: "_Pardon,\r\nje ne suis pas setul._" Yagitch was delighted with him, and blessed\r\nhim as a worthy successor, as Derchavin blessed Pushkin; he appeared\r\nto be fond of him. They would play billiards or picquet by the hour\r\ntogether without uttering a word, if Yagitch drove out on any\r\nexpedition he always took Volodya with him, and Yagitch was the\r\nonly person Volodya initiated into the mysteries of his thesis. In\r\nearlier days, when Yagitch was rather younger, they had often been\r\nin the position of rivals, but they had never been jealous of one\r\nanother. In the circle in which they moved Yagitch was nicknamed\r\nBig Volodya, and his friend Little Volodya.\r\n\r\nBesides Big Volodya, Little Volodya, and Sofya Lvovna, there was a\r\nfourth person in the sledge--Margarita Alexandrovna, or, as every\r\none called her, Rita, a cousin of Madame Yagitch--a very pale\r\ngirl over thirty, with black eyebrows and a pince-nez, who was for\r\never smoking cigarettes, even in the bitterest frost, and who always\r\nhad her knees and the front of her blouse covered with cigarette\r\nash. She spoke through her nose, drawling every word, was of a cold\r\ntemperament, could drink any amount of wine and liquor without being\r\ndrunk, and used to tell scandalous anecdotes in a languid and\r\ntasteless way. At home she spent her days reading thick magazines,\r\ncovering them with cigarette ash, or eating frozen apples.\r\n\r\n"Sonia, give over fooling," she said, drawling. "It\'s really silly."\r\n\r\nAs they drew near the city gates they went more slowly, and began\r\nto pass people and houses. Sofya Lvovna subsided, nestled up to her\r\nhusband, and gave herself up to her thoughts. Little Volodya sat\r\nopposite. By now her light-hearted and cheerful thoughts were mingled\r\nwith gloomy ones. She thought that the man sitting opposite knew\r\nthat she loved him, and no doubt he believed the gossip that she\r\nmarried the Colonel _par d\xe9pit_. She had never told him of her love;\r\nshe had not wanted him to know, and had done her best to hide her\r\nfeeling, but from her face she knew that he understood her perfectly\r\n--and her pride suffered. But what was most humiliating in her\r\nposition was that, since her wedding, Volodya had suddenly begun\r\nto pay her attention, which he had never done before, spending hours\r\nwith her, sitting silent or chattering about trifles; and even now\r\nin the sledge, though he did not talk to her, he touched her foot\r\nwith his and pressed her hand a little. Evidently that was all he\r\nwanted, that she should be married; and it was evident that he\r\ndespised her and that she only excited in him an interest of a\r\nspecial kind as though she were an immoral and disreputable woman.\r\nAnd when the feeling of triumph and love for her husband were mingled\r\nin her soul with humiliation and wounded pride, she was overcome\r\nby a spirit of defiance, and longed to sit on the box, to shout and\r\nwhistle to the horses.\r\n\r\nJust as they passed the nunnery the huge hundred-ton bell rang out.\r\nRita crossed herself.\r\n\r\n"Our Olga is in that nunnery," said Sofya Lvovna, and she, too,\r\ncrossed herself and shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Why did she go into the nunnery?" said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n"_Par d\xe9pit_," Rita answered crossly, with obvious allusion to\r\nSofya\'s marrying Yagitch. "_Par d\xe9pit_ is all the fashion nowadays.\r\nDefiance of all the world. She was always laughing, a desperate\r\nflirt, fond of nothing but balls and young men, and all of a sudden\r\noff she went--to surprise every one!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true," said Volodya, turning down the collar of his fur\r\ncoat and showing his handsome face. "It wasn\'t a case of _par d\xe9pit_;\r\nit was simply horrible, if you like. Her brother Dmitri was sent\r\nto penal servitude, and they don\'t know where he is now. And her\r\nmother died of grief."\r\n\r\nHe turned up his collar again.\r\n\r\n"Olga did well," he added in a muffled voice. "Living as an adopted\r\nchild, and with such a paragon as Sofya Lvovna,--one must take\r\nthat into consideration too!"\r\n\r\nSofya Lvovna heard a tone of contempt in his voice, and longed to\r\nsay something rude to him, but she said nothing. The spirit of\r\ndefiance came over her again; she stood up again and shouted in a\r\ntearful voice:\r\n\r\n"I want to go to the early service! Driver, back! I want to see\r\nOlga."\r\n\r\nThey turned back. The nunnery bell had a deep note, and Sofya Lvovna\r\nfancied there was something in it that reminded her of Olga and her\r\nlife. The other church bells began ringing too. When the driver\r\nstopped the horses, Sofya Lvovna jumped out of the sledge and,\r\nunescorted and alone, went quickly up to the gate.\r\n\r\n"Make haste, please!" her husband called to her. "It\'s late already."\r\n\r\nShe went in at the dark gateway, then by the avenue that led from\r\nthe gate to the chief church. The snow crunched under her feet, and\r\nthe ringing was just above her head, and seemed to vibrate through\r\nher whole being. Here was the church door, then three steps down,\r\nand an ante-room with ikons of the saints on both sides, a fragrance\r\nof juniper and incense, another door, and a dark figure opening it\r\nand bowing very low. The service had not yet begun. One nun was\r\nwalking by the ikon-screen and lighting the candles on the tall\r\nstandard candlesticks, another was lighting the chandelier. Here\r\nand there, by the columns and the side chapels, there stood black,\r\nmotionless figures. "I suppose they must remain standing as they\r\nare now till the morning," thought Sofya Lvovna, and it seemed to\r\nher dark, cold, and dreary--drearier than a graveyard. She looked\r\nwith a feeling of dreariness at the still, motionless figures and\r\nsuddenly felt a pang at her heart. For some reason, in one short\r\nnun, with thin shoulders and a black kerchief on her head, she\r\nrecognised Olga, though when Olga went into the nunnery she had\r\nbeen plump and had looked taller. Hesitating and extremely agitated,\r\nSofya Lvovna went up to the nun, and looking over her shoulder into\r\nher face, recognised her as Olga.\r\n\r\n"Olga!" she cried, throwing up her hands, and could not speak from\r\nemotion. "Olga!"\r\n\r\nThe nun knew her at once; she raised her eyebrows in surprise, and\r\nher pale, freshly washed face, and even, it seemed, the white\r\nheadcloth that she wore under her wimple, beamed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"What a miracle from God!" she said, and she, too, threw up her\r\nthin, pale little hands.\r\n\r\nSofya Lvovna hugged her and kissed her warmly, and was afraid as\r\nshe did so that she might smell of spirits.\r\n\r\n"We were just driving past, and we thought of you," she said,\r\nbreathing hard, as though she had been running. "Dear me! How pale\r\nyou are! I . . . I\'m very glad to see you. Well, tell me how are\r\nyou? Are you dull?"\r\n\r\nSofya Lvovna looked round at the other nuns, and went on in a subdued\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"There\'ve been so many changes at home . . . you know, I\'m married\r\nto Colonel Yagitch. You remember him, no doubt. . . . I am very\r\nhappy with him."\r\n\r\n"Well, thank God for that. And is your father quite well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is quite well. He often speaks of you. You must come and\r\nsee us during the holidays, Olga, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I will come," said Olga, and she smiled. "I\'ll come on the second\r\nday."\r\n\r\nSofya Lvovna began crying, she did not know why, and for a minute\r\nshe shed tears in silence, then she wiped her eyes and said:\r\n\r\n"Rita will be very sorry not to have seen you. She is with us too.\r\nAnd Volodya\'s here. They are close to the gate. How pleased they\'d\r\nbe if you\'d come out and see them. Let\'s go out to them; the service\r\nhasn\'t begun yet."\r\n\r\n"Let us," Olga agreed. She crossed herself three times and went out\r\nwith Sofya Lvovna to the entrance.\r\n\r\n"So you say you\'re happy, Sonitchka?" she asked when they came out\r\nat the gate.\r\n\r\n"Very."\r\n\r\n"Well, thank God for that."\r\n\r\nThe two Volodyas, seeing the nun, got out of the sledge and greeted\r\nher respectfully. Both were visibly touched by her pale face and\r\nher black monastic dress, and both were pleased that she had\r\nremembered them and come to greet them. That she might not be cold,\r\nSofya Lvovna wrapped her up in a rug and put one half of her fur\r\ncoat round her. Her tears had relieved and purified her heart, and\r\nshe was glad that this noisy, restless, and, in reality, impure\r\nnight should unexpectedly end so purely and serenely. And to keep\r\nOlga by her a little longer she suggested:\r\n\r\n"Let us take her for a drive! Get in, Olga; we\'ll go a little way."\r\n\r\nThe men expected the nun to refuse--saints don\'t dash about in\r\nthree-horse sledges; but to their surprise, she consented and got\r\ninto the sledge. And while the horses were galloping to the city\r\ngate all were silent, and only tried to make her warm and comfortable,\r\nand each of them was thinking of what she had been in the past and\r\nwhat she was now. Her face was now passionless, inexpressive, cold,\r\npale, and transparent, as though there were water, not blood, in\r\nher veins. And two or three years ago she had been plump and rosy,\r\ntalking about her suitors and laughing at every trifle.\r\n\r\nNear the city gate the sledge turned back; when it stopped ten\r\nminutes later near the nunnery, Olga got out of the sledge. The\r\nbell had begun to ring more rapidly.\r\n\r\n"The Lord save you," said Olga, and she bowed low as nuns do.\r\n\r\n"Mind you come, Olga."\r\n\r\n"I will, I will."\r\n\r\nShe went and quickly disappeared through the gateway. And when after\r\nthat they drove on again, Sofya Lvovna felt very sad. Every one was\r\nsilent. She felt dispirited and weak all over. That she should have\r\nmade a nun get into a sledge and drive in a company hardly sober\r\nseemed to her now stupid, tactless, and almost sacrilegious. As the\r\nintoxication passed off, the desire to deceive herself passed away\r\nalso. It was clear to her now that she did not love her husband,\r\nand never could love him, and that it all had been foolishness and\r\nnonsense. She had married him from interested motives, because, in\r\nthe words of her school friends, he was madly rich, and because she\r\nwas afraid of becoming an old maid like Rita, and because she was\r\nsick of her father, the doctor, and wanted to annoy Volodya.\r\n\r\nIf she could have imagined when she got married, that it would be\r\nso oppressive, so dreadful, and so hideous, she would not have\r\nconsented to the marriage for all the wealth in the world. But now\r\nthere was no setting it right. She must make up her mind to it.\r\n\r\nThey reached home. Getting into her warm, soft bed, and pulling the\r\nbed-clothes over her, Sofya Lvovna recalled the dark church, the\r\nsmell of incense, and the figures by the columns, and she felt\r\nfrightened at the thought that these figures would be standing there\r\nall the while she was asleep. The early service would be very, very\r\nlong; then there would be "the hours," then the mass, then the\r\nservice of the day.\r\n\r\n"But of course there is a God--there certainly is a God; and I\r\nshall have to die, so that sooner or later one must think of one\'s\r\nsoul, of eternal life, like Olga. Olga is saved now; she has settled\r\nall questions for herself. . . . But if there is no God? Then her\r\nlife is wasted. But how is it wasted? Why is it wasted?"\r\n\r\nAnd a minute later the thought came into her mind again:\r\n\r\n"There is a God; death must come; one must think of one\'s soul. If\r\nOlga were to see death before her this minute she would not be\r\nafraid. She is prepared. And the great thing is that she has already\r\nsolved the problem of life for herself. There is a God . . . yes\r\n. . . . But is there no other solution except going into a monastery?\r\nTo go into the monastery means to renounce life, to spoil it . . . ."\r\n\r\nSofya Lvovna began to feel rather frightened; she hid her head under\r\nher pillow.\r\n\r\n"I mustn\'t think about it," she whispered. "I mustn\'t. . . ."\r\n\r\nYagitch was walking about on the carpet in the next room with a\r\nsoft jingle of spurs, thinking about something. The thought occurred\r\nto Sofya Lvovna that this man was near and dear to her only for one\r\nreason--that his name, too, was Vladimir. She sat up in bed and\r\ncalled tenderly:\r\n\r\n"Volodya!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" her husband responded.\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\nShe lay down again. She heard a bell, perhaps the same nunnery bell.\r\nAgain she thought of the vestibule and the dark figures, and thoughts\r\nof God and of inevitable death strayed through her mind, and she\r\ncovered her ears that she might not hear the bell. She thought that\r\nbefore old age and death there would be a long, long life before\r\nher, and that day by day she would have to put up with being close\r\nto a man she did not love, who had just now come into the bedroom\r\nand was getting into bed, and would have to stifle in her heart her\r\nhopeless love for the other young, fascinating, and, as she thought,\r\nexceptional man. She looked at her husband and tried to say good-night\r\nto him, but suddenly burst out crying instead. She was vexed with\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"Well, now then for the music!" said Yagitch.\r\n\r\nShe was not pacified till ten o\'clock in the morning. She left off\r\ncrying and trembling all over, but she began to have a splitting\r\nheadache. Yagitch was in haste to go to the late mass, and in the\r\nnext room was grumbling at his orderly, who was helping him to\r\ndress. He came into the bedroom once with the soft jingle of his\r\nspurs to fetch something, and then a second time wearing his\r\nepaulettes, and his orders on his breast, limping slightly from\r\nrheumatism; and it struck Sofya Lvovna that he looked and walked\r\nlike a bird of prey.\r\n\r\nShe heard Yagitch ring the telephone bell.\r\n\r\n"Be so good as to put me on to the Vassilevsky barracks," he said;\r\nand a minute later: "Vassilevsky barracks? Please ask Doctor\r\nSalimovitch to come to the telephone . . ." And a minute later:\r\n"With whom am I speaking? Is it you, Volodya? Delighted. Ask your\r\nfather to come to us at once, dear boy; my wife is rather shattered\r\nafter yesterday. Not at home, you say? H\'m! . . . Thank you. Very\r\ngood. I shall be much obliged . . . _Merci_."\r\n\r\nYagitch came into the bedroom for the third time, bent down to his\r\nwife, made the sign of the cross over her, gave her his hand to\r\nkiss (the women who had been in love with him used to kiss his hand\r\nand he had got into the habit of it), and saying that he should be\r\nback to dinner, went out.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock the maid came in to announce that Vladimir\r\nMihalovitch had arrived. Sofya Lvovna, staggering with fatigue and\r\nheadache, hurriedly put on her marvellous new lilac dressing-gown\r\ntrimmed with fur, and hastily did up her hair after a fashion. She\r\nwas conscious of an inexpressible tenderness in her heart, and was\r\ntrembling with joy and with fear that he might go away. She wanted\r\nnothing but to look at him.\r\n\r\nVolodya came dressed correctly for calling, in a swallow-tail coat\r\nand white tie. When Sofya Lvovna came in he kissed her hand and\r\nexpressed his genuine regret that she was ill. Then when they had\r\nsat down, he admired her dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"I was upset by seeing Olga yesterday," she said. "At first I felt\r\nit dreadful, but now I envy her. She is like a rock that cannot be\r\nshattered; there is no moving her. But was there no other solution\r\nfor her, Volodya? Is burying oneself alive the only solution of the\r\nproblem of life? Why, it\'s death, not life!"\r\n\r\nAt the thought of Olga, Volodya\'s face softened.\r\n\r\n"Here, you are a clever man, Volodya," said Sofya Lvovna. "Show me\r\nhow to do what Olga has done. Of course, I am not a believer and\r\nshould not go into a nunnery, but one can do something equivalent.\r\nLife isn\'t easy for me," she added after a brief pause. "Tell me\r\nwhat to do. . . . Tell me something I can believe in. Tell me\r\nsomething, if it\'s only one word."\r\n\r\n"One word? By all means: tararaboomdeeay."\r\n\r\n"Volodya, why do you despise me?" she asked hotly. "You talk to me\r\nin a special, fatuous way, if you\'ll excuse me, not as one talks\r\nto one\'s friends and women one respects. You are so good at your\r\nwork, you are fond of science; why do you never talk of it to me?\r\nWhy is it? Am I not good enough?"\r\n\r\nVolodya frowned with annoyance and said:\r\n\r\n"Why do you want science all of a sudden? Don\'t you perhaps want\r\nconstitutional government? Or sturgeon and horse-radish?"\r\n\r\n"Very well, I am a worthless, trivial, silly woman with no convictions.\r\nI have a mass, a mass of defects. I am neurotic, corrupt, and I\r\nought to be despised for it. But you, Volodya, are ten years older\r\nthan I am, and my husband is thirty years older. I\'ve grown up\r\nbefore your eyes, and if you would, you could have made anything\r\nyou liked of me--an angel. But you"--her voice quivered--\r\n"treat me horribly. Yagitch has married me in his old age, and\r\nyou . . ."\r\n\r\n"Come, come," said Volodya, sitting nearer her and kissing both her\r\nhands. "Let the Schopenhauers philosophise and prove whatever they\r\nlike, while we\'ll kiss these little hands."\r\n\r\n"You despise me, and if only you knew how miserable it makes me,"\r\nshe said uncertainly, knowing beforehand that he would not believe\r\nher. "And if you only knew how I want to change, to begin another\r\nlife! I think of it with enthusiasm!" and tears of enthusiasm\r\nactually came into her eyes. "To be good, honest, pure, not to be\r\nlying; to have an object in life."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, come, please don\'t be affected! I don\'t like it!" said\r\nVolodya, and an ill-humoured expression came into his face. "Upon\r\nmy word, you might be on the stage. Let us behave like simple\r\npeople."\r\n\r\nTo prevent him from getting cross and going away, she began defending\r\nherself, and forced herself to smile to please him; and again she\r\nbegan talking of Olga, and of how she longed to solve the problem\r\nof her life and to become something real.\r\n\r\n"Ta-ra-ra-boomdee-ay," he hummed. "Ta-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay!"\r\n\r\nAnd all at once he put his arm round her waist, while she, without\r\nknowing what she was doing, laid her hands on his shoulders and for\r\na minute gazed with ecstasy, almost intoxication, at his clever,\r\nironical face, his brow, his eyes, his handsome beard.\r\n\r\n"You have known that I love you for ever so long," she confessed\r\nto him, and she blushed painfully, and felt that her lips were\r\ntwitching with shame. "I love you. Why do you torture me?"\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes and kissed him passionately on the lips, and for\r\na long while, a full minute, could not take her lips away, though\r\nshe knew it was unseemly, that he might be thinking the worse of\r\nher, that a servant might come in.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how you torture me!" she repeated.\r\n\r\nWhen half an hour later, having got all that he wanted, he was\r\nsitting at lunch in the dining-room, she was kneeling before him,\r\ngazing greedily into his face, and he told her that she was like a\r\nlittle dog waiting for a bit of ham to be thrown to it. Then he sat\r\nher on his knee, and dancing her up and down like a child, hummed:\r\n\r\n"Tara-raboom-dee-ay. . . . Tara-raboom-dee-ay." And when he was\r\ngetting ready to go she asked him in a passionate whisper:\r\n\r\n"When? To-day? Where?" And held out both hands to his mouth as\r\nthough she wanted to seize his answer in them.\r\n\r\n"To-day it will hardly be convenient," he said after a minute\'s\r\nthought. "To-morrow, perhaps."\r\n\r\nAnd they parted. Before dinner Sofya Lvovna went to the nunnery to\r\nsee Olga, but there she was told that Olga was reading the psalter\r\nsomewhere over the dead. From the nunnery she went to her father\'s\r\nand found that he, too, was out. Then she took another sledge and\r\ndrove aimlessly about the streets till evening. And for some reason\r\nshe kept thinking of the aunt whose eyes were red with crying, and\r\nwho could find no peace anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd at night they drove out again with three horses to a restaurant\r\nout of town and listened to the gipsies. And driving back past the\r\nnunnery again, Sofya Lvovna thought of Olga, and she felt aghast\r\nat the thought that for the girls and women of her class there was\r\nno solution but to go on driving about and telling lies, or going\r\ninto a nunnery to mortify the flesh. . . . And next day she met her\r\nlover, and again Sofya Lvovna drove about the town alone in a hired\r\nsledge thinking about her aunt.\r\n\r\nA week later Volodya threw her over. And after that life went on\r\nas before, uninteresting, miserable, and sometimes even agonising.\r\nThe Colonel and Volodya spent hours playing billiards and picquet,\r\nRita told anecdotes in the same languid, tasteless way, and Sofya\r\nLvovna went about alone in hired sledges and kept begging her husband\r\nto take her for a good drive with three horses.\r\n\r\nGoing almost every day to the nunnery, she wearied Olga, complaining\r\nof her unbearable misery, weeping, and feeling as she did so that\r\nshe brought with her into the cell something impure, pitiful, shabby.\r\nAnd Olga repeated to her mechanically as though a lesson learnt by\r\nrote, that all this was of no consequence, that it would all pass\r\nand God would forgive her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TROUSSEAU\r\n\r\nI HAVE seen a great many houses in my time, little and big, new and\r\nold, built of stone and of wood, but of one house I have kept a\r\nvery vivid memory. It was, properly speaking, rather a cottage than\r\na house--a tiny cottage of one story, with three windows, looking\r\nextraordinarily like a little old hunchback woman with a cap on.\r\nIts white stucco walls, its tiled roof, and dilapidated chimney,\r\nwere all drowned in a perfect sea of green. The cottage was lost\r\nto sight among the mulberry-trees, acacias, and poplars planted by\r\nthe grandfathers and great-grandfathers of its present occupants.\r\nAnd yet it is a town house. Its wide courtyard stands in a row with\r\nother similar green courtyards, and forms part of a street. Nothing\r\never drives down that street, and very few persons are ever seen\r\nwalking through it.\r\n\r\nThe shutters of the little house are always closed; its occupants\r\ndo not care for sunlight--the light is no use to them. The windows\r\nare never opened, for they are not fond of fresh air. People who\r\nspend their lives in the midst of acacias, mulberries, and nettles\r\nhave no passion for nature. It is only to the summer visitor that\r\nGod has vouchsafed an eye for the beauties of nature. The rest of\r\nmankind remain steeped in profound ignorance of the existence of\r\nsuch beauties. People never prize what they have always had in\r\nabundance. "What we have, we do not treasure," and what\'s more we\r\ndo not even love it.\r\n\r\nThe little house stands in an earthly paradise of green trees with\r\nhappy birds nesting in them. But inside . . . alas . . . ! In summer,\r\nit is close and stifling within; in winter, hot as a Turkish bath,\r\nnot one breath of air, and the dreariness! . . .\r\n\r\nThe first time I visited the little house was many years ago on\r\nbusiness. I brought a message from the Colonel who was the owner\r\nof the house to his wife and daughter. That first visit I remember\r\nvery distinctly. It would be impossible, indeed, to forget it.\r\n\r\nImagine a limp little woman of forty, gazing at you with alarm and\r\nastonishment while you walk from the passage into the parlour. You\r\nare a stranger, a visitor, "a young man"; that\'s enough to reduce\r\nher to a state of terror and bewilderment. Though you have no dagger,\r\naxe, or revolver in your hand, and though you smile affably, you\r\nare met with alarm.\r\n\r\n"Whom have I the honour and pleasure of addressing?" the little\r\nlady asks in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\nI introduced myself and explained why I had come. The alarm and\r\namazement were at once succeeded by a shrill, joyful "Ach!" and she\r\nturned her eyes upwards to the ceiling. This "Ach!" was caught up\r\nlike an echo and repeated from the hall to the parlour, from the\r\nparlour to the kitchen, and so on down to the cellar. Soon the whole\r\nhouse was resounding with "Ach!" in various voices.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later I was sitting on a big, soft, warm lounge in the\r\ndrawing-room listening to the "Ach!" echoing all down the street.\r\nThere was a smell of moth powder, and of goatskin shoes, a pair of\r\nwhich lay on a chair beside me wrapped in a handkerchief. In the\r\nwindows were geraniums, and muslin curtains, and on the curtains\r\nwere torpid flies. On the wall hung the portrait of some bishop,\r\npainted in oils, with the glass broken at one corner, and next to\r\nthe bishop a row of ancestors with lemon-coloured faces of a gipsy\r\ntype. On the table lay a thimble, a reel of cotton, and a half-knitted\r\nstocking, and paper patterns and a black blouse, tacked together,\r\nwere lying on the floor. In the next room two alarmed and fluttered\r\nold women were hurriedly picking up similar patterns and pieces of\r\ntailor\'s chalk from the floor.\r\n\r\n"You must, please, excuse us; we are dreadfully untidy," said the\r\nlittle lady.\r\n\r\nWhile she talked to me, she stole embarrassed glances towards the\r\nother room where the patterns were still being picked up. The door,\r\ntoo, seemed embarrassed, opening an inch or two and then shutting\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said the little lady, addressing the door.\r\n\r\n_"O\xf9 est mon cravatte lequel mon p\xe8re m\'avait envoy\xe9 de Koursk?"_\r\nasked a female voice at the door.\r\n\r\n_"Ah, est-ce que, Marie . . . que_. . . Really, it\'s impossible\r\n. . . . _Nous avons donc chez nous un homme peu connu de nous._ Ask\r\nLukerya."\r\n\r\n"How well we speak French, though!" I read in the eyes of the little\r\nlady, who was flushing with pleasure.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the door opened and I saw a tall, thin girl of\r\nnineteen, in a long muslin dress with a gilt belt from which, I\r\nremember, hung a mother-of-pearl fan. She came in, dropped a curtsy,\r\nand flushed crimson. Her long nose, which was slightly pitted with\r\nsmallpox, turned red first, and then the flush passed up to her\r\neyes and her forehead.\r\n\r\n"My daughter," chanted the little lady, "and, Manetchka, this is a\r\nyoung gentleman who has come," etc.\r\n\r\nI was introduced, and expressed my surprise at the number of paper\r\npatterns. Mother and daughter dropped their eyes.\r\n\r\n"We had a fair here at Ascension," said the mother; "we always buy\r\nmaterials at the fair, and then it keeps us busy with sewing till\r\nthe next year\'s fair comes around again. We never put things out\r\nto be made. My husband\'s pay is not very ample, and we are not able\r\nto permit ourselves luxuries. So we have to make up everything\r\nourselves."\r\n\r\n"But who will ever wear such a number of things? There are only two\r\nof you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh . . . as though we were thinking of wearing them! They are not\r\nto be worn; they are for the trousseau!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, _mamam_, what are you saying?" said the daughter, and she\r\ncrimsoned again. "Our visitor might suppose it was true. I don\'t\r\nintend to be married. Never!"\r\n\r\nShe said this, but at the very word "married" her eyes glowed.\r\n\r\nTea, biscuits, butter, and jam were brought in, followed by raspberries\r\nand cream. At seven o\'clock, we had supper, consisting of six\r\ncourses, and while we were at supper I heard a loud yawn from the\r\nnext room. I looked with surprise towards the door: it was a yawn\r\nthat could only come from a man.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my husband\'s brother, Yegor Semyonitch," the little lady\r\nexplained, noticing my surprise. "He\'s been living with us for the\r\nlast year. Please excuse him; he cannot come in to see you. He is\r\nsuch an unsociable person, he is shy with strangers. He is going\r\ninto a monastery. He was unfairly treated in the service, and the\r\ndisappointment has preyed on his mind."\r\n\r\nAfter supper the little lady showed the vestment which Yegor\r\nSemyonitch was embroidering with his own hands as an offering for\r\nthe Church. Manetchka threw off her shyness for a moment and showed\r\nme the tobacco-pouch she was embroidering for her father. When I\r\npretended to be greatly struck by her work, she flushed crimson and\r\nwhispered something in her mother\'s ear. The latter beamed all over,\r\nand invited me to go with her to the store-room. There I was shown\r\nfive large trunks, and a number of smaller trunks and boxes.\r\n\r\n"This is her trousseau," her mother whispered; "we made it all\r\nourselves."\r\n\r\nAfter looking at these forbidding trunks I took leave of my hospitable\r\nhostesses. They made me promise to come and see them again some\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt happened that I was able to keep this promise. Seven years after\r\nmy first visit, I was sent down to the little town to give expert\r\nevidence in a case that was being tried there.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the little house I heard the same "Ach!" echo through\r\nit. They recognised me at once. . . . Well they might! My first\r\nvisit had been an event in their lives, and when events are few\r\nthey are long remembered.\r\n\r\nI walked into the drawing-room: the mother, who had grown stouter\r\nand was already getting grey, was creeping about on the floor,\r\ncutting out some blue material. The daughter was sitting on the\r\nsofa, embroidering.\r\n\r\nThere was the same smell of moth powder; there were the same patterns,\r\nthe same portrait with the broken glass. But yet there was a change.\r\nBeside the portrait of the bishop hung a portrait of the Colonel,\r\nand the ladies were in mourning. The Colonel\'s death had occurred\r\na week after his promotion to be a general.\r\n\r\nReminiscences began. . . . The widow shed tears.\r\n\r\n"We have had a terrible loss," she said. "My husband, you know, is\r\ndead. We are alone in the world now, and have no one but ourselves\r\nto look to. Yegor Semyonitch is alive, but I have no good news to\r\ntell of him. They would not have him in the monastery on account\r\nof--of intoxicating beverages. And now in his disappointment he\r\ndrinks more than ever. I am thinking of going to the Marshal of\r\nNobility to lodge a complaint. Would you believe it, he has more\r\nthan once broken open the trunks and . . . taken Manetchka\'s trousseau\r\nand given it to beggars. He has taken everything out of two of the\r\ntrunks! If he goes on like this, my Manetchka will be left without\r\na trousseau at all."\r\n\r\n"What are you saying, _mamam_?" said Manetchka, embarrassed. "Our\r\nvisitor might suppose . . . there\'s no knowing what he might suppose\r\n. . . . I shall never--never marry."\r\n\r\nManetchka cast her eyes up to the ceiling with a look of hope and\r\naspiration, evidently not for a moment believing what she said.\r\n\r\nA little bald-headed masculine figure in a brown coat and goloshes\r\ninstead of boots darted like a mouse across the passage and\r\ndisappeared. "Yegor Semyonitch, I suppose," I thought.\r\n\r\nI looked at the mother and daughter together. They both looked much\r\nolder and terribly changed. The mother\'s hair was silvered, but the\r\ndaughter was so faded and withered that her mother might have been\r\ntaken for her elder sister, not more than five years her senior.\r\n\r\n"I have made up my mind to go to the Marshal," the mother said to\r\nme, forgetting she had told me this already. "I mean to make a\r\ncomplaint. Yegor Semyonitch lays his hands on everything we make,\r\nand offers it up for the sake of his soul. My Manetchka is left\r\nwithout a trousseau."\r\n\r\nManetchka flushed again, but this time she said nothing.\r\n\r\n"We have to make them all over again. And God knows we are not so\r\nwell off. We are all alone in the world now."\r\n\r\n"We are alone in the world," repeated Manetchka.\r\n\r\nA year ago fate brought me once more to the little house.\r\n\r\nWalking into the drawing-room, I saw the old lady. Dressed all in\r\nblack with heavy crape _pleureuses_, she was sitting on the sofa\r\nsewing. Beside her sat the little old man in the brown coat and the\r\ngoloshes instead of boots. On seeing me, he jumped up and ran out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nIn response to my greeting, the old lady smiled and said:\r\n\r\n_"Je suis charm\xe9e de vous revoir, monsieur."_\r\n\r\n"What are you making?" I asked, a little later.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a blouse. When it\'s finished I shall take it to the priest\'s\r\nto be put away, or else Yegor Semyonitch would carry it off. I store\r\neverything at the priest\'s now," she added in a whisper.\r\n\r\nAnd looking at the portrait of her daughter which stood before her\r\non the table, she sighed and said:\r\n\r\n"We are all alone in the world."\r\n\r\nAnd where was the daughter? Where was Manetchka? I did not ask. I\r\ndid not dare to ask the old mother dressed in her new deep mourning.\r\nAnd while I was in the room, and when I got up to go, no Manetchka\r\ncame out to greet me. I did not hear her voice, nor her soft, timid\r\nfootstep. . . .\r\n\r\nI understood, and my heart was heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HELPMATE\r\n\r\n"I\'VE asked you not to tidy my table," said Nikolay Yevgrafitch.\r\n"There\'s no finding anything when you\'ve tidied up. Where\'s the\r\ntelegram? Where have you thrown it? Be so good as to look for it.\r\nIt\'s from Kazan, dated yesterday."\r\n\r\nThe maid--a pale, very slim girl with an indifferent expression\r\n--found several telegrams in the basket under the table, and handed\r\nthem to the doctor without a word; but all these were telegrams\r\nfrom patients. Then they looked in the drawing-room, and in Olga\r\nDmitrievna\'s room.\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight. Nikolay Yevgrafitch knew his wife would not\r\nbe home very soon, not till five o\'clock at least. He did not trust\r\nher, and when she was long away he could not sleep, was worried,\r\nand at the same time he despised his wife, and her bed, and her\r\nlooking-glass, and her boxes of sweets, and the hyacinths, and the\r\nlilies of the valley which were sent her every day by some one or\r\nother, and which diffused the sickly fragrance of a florist\'s shop\r\nall over the house. On such nights he became petty, ill-humoured,\r\nirritable, and he fancied now that it was very necessary for him\r\nto have the telegram he had received the day before from his brother,\r\nthough it contained nothing but Christmas greetings.\r\n\r\nOn the table of his wife\'s room under the box of stationery he found\r\na telegram, and glanced at it casually. It was addressed to his\r\nwife, care of his mother-in-law, from Monte Carlo, and signed Michel\r\n. . . . The doctor did not understand one word of it, as it was in\r\nsome foreign language, apparently English.\r\n\r\n"Who is this Michel? Why Monte Carlo? Why directed care of her\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years of his married life he had grown used to\r\nbeing suspicious, guessing, catching at clues, and it had several\r\ntimes occurred to him, that his exercise at home had qualified him\r\nto become an excellent detective. Going into his study and beginning\r\nto reflect, he recalled at once how he had been with his wife in\r\nPetersburg a year and a half ago, and had lunched with an old\r\nschool-fellow, a civil engineer, and how that engineer had introduced\r\nto him and his wife a young man of two or three and twenty, called\r\nMihail Ivanovitch, with rather a curious short surname--Riss. Two\r\nmonths later the doctor had seen the young man\'s photograph in his\r\nwife\'s album, with an inscription in French: "In remembrance of the\r\npresent and in hope of the future." Later on he had met the young\r\nman himself at his mother-in-law\'s. And that was at the time when\r\nhis wife had taken to being very often absent and coming home at\r\nfour or five o\'clock in the morning, and was constantly asking him\r\nto get her a passport for abroad, which he kept refusing to do; and\r\na continual feud went on in the house which made him feel ashamed\r\nto face the servants.\r\n\r\nSix months before, his colleagues had decided that he was going\r\ninto consumption, and advised him to throw up everything and go to\r\nthe Crimea. When she heard of this, Olga Dmitrievna affected to be\r\nvery much alarmed; she began to be affectionate to her husband, and\r\nkept assuring him that it would be cold and dull in the Crimea, and\r\nthat he had much better go to Nice, and that she would go with him,\r\nand there would nurse him, look after him, take care of him.\r\n\r\nNow, he understood why his wife was so particularly anxious to go\r\nto Nice: her Michel lived at Monte Carlo.\r\n\r\nHe took an English dictionary, and translating the words, and\r\nguessing their meaning, by degrees he put together the following\r\nsentence: "I drink to the health of my beloved darling, and kiss\r\nher little foot a thousand times, and am impatiently expecting her\r\narrival." He pictured the pitiable, ludicrous part he would play\r\nif he had agreed to go to Nice with his wife. He felt so mortified\r\nthat he almost shed tears and began pacing to and fro through all\r\nthe rooms of the flat in great agitation. His pride, his plebeian\r\nfastidiousness, was revolted. Clenching his fists and scowling with\r\ndisgust, he wondered how he, the son of a village priest, brought\r\nup in a clerical school, a plain, straightforward man, a surgeon\r\nby profession--how could he have let himself be enslaved, have\r\nsunk into such shameful bondage to this weak, worthless, mercenary,\r\nlow creature.\r\n\r\n"\'Little foot\'!" he muttered to himself, crumpling up the telegram;\r\n"\'little foot\'!"\r\n\r\nOf the time when he fell in love and proposed to her, and the seven\r\nyears that he had been living with her, all that remained in his\r\nmemory was her long, fragrant hair, a mass of soft lace, and her\r\nlittle feet, which certainly were very small, beautiful feet; and\r\neven now it seemed as though he still had from those old embraces\r\nthe feeling of lace and silk upon his hands and face--and nothing\r\nmore. Nothing more--that is, not counting hysterics, shrieks,\r\nreproaches, threats, and lies--brazen, treacherous lies. He\r\nremembered how in his father\'s house in the village a bird would\r\nsometimes chance to fly in from the open air into the house and\r\nwould struggle desperately against the window-panes and upset things;\r\nso this woman from a class utterly alien to him had flown into his\r\nlife and made complete havoc of it. The best years of his life had\r\nbeen spent as though in hell, his hopes for happiness shattered and\r\nturned into a mockery, his health gone, his rooms as vulgar in their\r\natmosphere as a cocotte\'s, and of the ten thousand he earned every\r\nyear he could never save ten roubles to send his old mother in the\r\nvillage, and his debts were already about fifteen thousand. It\r\nseemed that if a band of brigands had been living in his rooms his\r\nlife would not have been so hopelessly, so irremediably ruined as\r\nby the presence of this woman.\r\n\r\nHe began coughing and gasping for breath. He ought to have gone to\r\nbed and got warm, but he could not. He kept walking about the rooms,\r\nor sat down to the table, nervously fidgeting with a pencil and\r\nscribbling mechanically on a paper.\r\n\r\n"Trying a pen. . . . A little foot."\r\n\r\nBy five o\'clock he grew weaker and threw all the blame on himself.\r\nIt seemed to him now that if Olga Dmitrievna had married some one\r\nelse who might have had a good influence over her--who knows?--\r\nshe might after all have become a good, straightforward woman. He\r\nwas a poor psychologist, and knew nothing of the female heart;\r\nbesides, he was churlish, uninteresting. . . .\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t long to live now," he thought. "I am a dead man, and\r\nought not to stand in the way of the living. It would be strange\r\nand stupid to insist upon one\'s rights now. I\'ll have it out with\r\nher; let her go to the man she loves. . . . I\'ll give her a divorce.\r\nI\'ll take the blame on myself."\r\n\r\nOlga Dmitrievna came in at last, and she walked into the study and\r\nsank into a chair just as she was in her white cloak, hat, and\r\noverboots.\r\n\r\n"The nasty, fat boy," she said with a sob, breathing hard. "It\'s\r\nreally dishonest; it\'s disgusting." She stamped. "I can\'t put up\r\nwith it; I can\'t, I can\'t!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked Nikolay Yevgrafitch, going up to her.\r\n\r\n"That student, Azarbekov, was seeing me home, and he lost my bag,\r\nand there was fifteen roubles in it. I borrowed it from mamma."\r\n\r\nShe was crying in a most genuine way, like a little girl, and not\r\nonly her handkerchief, but even her gloves, were wet with tears.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be helped!" said the doctor. "If he\'s lost it, he\'s lost\r\nit, and it\'s no good worrying over it. Calm yourself; I want to\r\ntalk to you."\r\n\r\n"I am not a millionaire to lose money like that. He says he\'ll pay\r\nit back, but I don\'t believe him; he\'s poor . . ."\r\n\r\nHer husband begged her to calm herself and to listen to him, but\r\nshe kept on talking of the student and of the fifteen roubles she\r\nhad lost.\r\n\r\n"Ach! I\'ll give you twenty-five roubles to-morrow if you\'ll only\r\nhold your tongue!" he said irritably.\r\n\r\n"I must take off my things!" she said, crying. "I can\'t talk seriously\r\nin my fur coat! How strange you are!"\r\n\r\nHe helped her off with her coat and overboots, detecting as he did\r\nso the smell of the white wine she liked to drink with oysters (in\r\nspite of her etherealness she ate and drank a great deal). She went\r\ninto her room and came back soon after, having changed her things\r\nand powdered her face, though her eyes still showed traces of tears.\r\nShe sat down, retreating into her light, lacy dressing-gown, and\r\nin the mass of billowy pink her husband could see nothing but her\r\nhair, which she had let down, and her little foot wearing a slipper.\r\n\r\n"What do you want to talk about?" she asked, swinging herself in a\r\nrocking-chair.\r\n\r\n"I happened to see this;" and he handed her the telegram.\r\n\r\nShe read it and shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said, rocking herself faster. "That\'s the usual New\r\nYear\'s greeting and nothing else. There are no secrets in it."\r\n\r\n"You are reckoning on my not knowing English. No, I don\'t know it;\r\nbut I have a dictionary. That telegram is from Riss; he drinks to\r\nthe health of his beloved and sends you a thousand kisses. But let\r\nus leave that," the doctor went on hurriedly. "I don\'t in the least\r\nwant to reproach you or make a scene. We\'ve had scenes and reproaches\r\nenough; it\'s time to make an end of them. . . . This is what I want\r\nto say to you: you are free, and can live as you like."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. She began crying quietly.\r\n\r\n"I set you free from the necessity of lying and keeping up pretences,"\r\nNikolay Yevgrafitch continued. "If you love that young man, love\r\nhim; if you want to go abroad to him, go. You are young, healthy,\r\nand I am a wreck, and haven\'t long to live. In short . . . you\r\nunderstand me."\r\n\r\nHe was agitated and could not go on. Olga Dmitrievna, crying and\r\nspeaking in a voice of self-pity, acknowledged that she loved Riss,\r\nand used to drive out of town with him and see him in his rooms,\r\nand now she really did long to go abroad.\r\n\r\n"You see, I hide nothing from you," she added, with a sigh. "My\r\nwhole soul lies open before you. And I beg you again, be generous,\r\nget me a passport."\r\n\r\n"I repeat, you are free."\r\n\r\nShe moved to another seat nearer him to look at the expression of\r\nhis face. She did not believe him and wanted now to understand his\r\nsecret meaning. She never did believe any one, and however generous\r\nwere their intentions, she always suspected some petty or ignoble\r\nmotive or selfish object in them. And when she looked searchingly\r\ninto his face, it seemed to him that there was a gleam of green\r\nlight in her eyes as in a cat\'s.\r\n\r\n"When shall I get the passport?" she asked softly.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly had an impulse to say "Never"; but he restrained himself\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n"When you like."\r\n\r\n"I shall only go for a month."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll go to Riss for good. I\'ll get you a divorce, take the blame\r\non myself, and Riss can marry you."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want a divorce!" Olga Dmitrievna retorted quickly,\r\nwith an astonished face. "I am not asking you for a divorce! Get\r\nme a passport, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"But why don\'t you want the divorce?" asked the doctor, beginning\r\nto feel irritated. "You are a strange woman. How strange you are!\r\nIf you are fond of him in earnest and he loves you too, in your\r\nposition you can do nothing better than get married. Can you really\r\nhesitate between marriage and adultery?"\r\n\r\n"I understand you," she said, walking away from him, and a spiteful,\r\nvindictive expression came into her face. "I understand you perfectly.\r\nYou are sick of me, and you simply want to get rid of me, to force\r\nthis divorce on me. Thank you very much; I am not such a fool as\r\nyou think. I won\'t accept the divorce and I won\'t leave you--I\r\nwon\'t, I won\'t! To begin with, I don\'t want to lose my position in\r\nsociety," she continued quickly, as though afraid of being prevented\r\nfrom speaking. "Secondly, I am twenty-seven and Riss is only\r\ntwenty-three; he\'ll be tired of me in a year and throw me over. And\r\nwhat\'s more, if you care to know, I\'m not certain that my feeling\r\nwill last long . . . so there! I\'m not going to leave you."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll turn you out of the house!" shouted Nikolay Yevgrafitch,\r\nstamping. "I shall turn you out, you vile, loathsome woman!"\r\n\r\n"We shall see!" she said, and went out.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight outside, but the doctor still sat at the table\r\nmoving the pencil over the paper and writing mechanically.\r\n\r\n"My dear Sir. . . . Little foot."\r\n\r\nOr he walked about and stopped in the drawing-room before a photograph\r\ntaken seven years ago, soon after his marriage, and looked at it\r\nfor a long time. It was a family group: his father-in-law, his\r\nmother-in-law, his wife Olga Dmitrievna when she was twenty, and\r\nhimself in the r\xf4le of a happy young husband. His father-in-law, a\r\nclean-shaven, dropsical privy councillor, crafty and avaricious;\r\nhis mother-in-law, a stout lady with small predatory features like\r\na weasel, who loved her daughter to distraction and helped her in\r\neverything; if her daughter were strangling some one, the mother\r\nwould not have protested, but would only have screened her with her\r\nskirts. Olga Dmitrievna, too, had small predatory-looking features,\r\nbut more expressive and bolder than her mother\'s; she was not a\r\nweasel, but a beast on a bigger scale! And Nikolay Yevgrafitch\r\nhimself in the photograph looked such a guileless soul, such a\r\nkindly, good fellow, so open and simple-hearted; his whole face was\r\nrelaxed in the na\xefve, good-natured smile of a divinity student, and\r\nhe had had the simplicity to believe that that company of beasts\r\nof prey into which destiny had chanced to thrust him would give him\r\nromance and happiness and all he had dreamed of when as a student\r\nhe used to sing the song "Youth is wasted, life is nought, when the\r\nheart is cold and loveless."\r\n\r\nAnd once more he asked himself in perplexity how he, the son of a\r\nvillage priest, with his democratic bringing up--a plain, blunt,\r\nstraightforward man--could have so helplessly surrendered to the\r\npower of this worthless, false, vulgar, petty creature, whose nature\r\nwas so utterly alien to him.\r\n\r\nWhen at eleven o\'clock he put on his coat to go to the hospital the\r\nservant came into his study.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"The mistress has got up and asks you for the twenty-five roubles\r\nyou promised her yesterday."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALENT\r\n\r\nAN artist called Yegor Savvitch, who was spending his summer holidays\r\nat the house of an officer\'s widow, was sitting on his bed, given\r\nup to the depression of morning. It was beginning to look like\r\nautumn out of doors. Heavy, clumsy clouds covered the sky in thick\r\nlayers; there was a cold, piercing wind, and with a plaintive wail\r\nthe trees were all bending on one side. He could see the yellow\r\nleaves whirling round in the air and on the earth. Farewell, summer!\r\nThis melancholy of nature is beautiful and poetical in its own way,\r\nwhen it is looked at with the eyes of an artist, but Yegor Savvitch\r\nwas in no humour to see beauty. He was devoured by ennui and his\r\nonly consolation was the thought that by to-morrow he would not be\r\nthere. The bed, the chairs, the tables, the floor, were all heaped\r\nup with cushions, crumpled bed-clothes, boxes. The floor had not\r\nbeen swept, the cotton curtains had been taken down from the windows.\r\nNext day he was moving, to town.\r\n\r\nHis landlady, the widow, was out. She had gone off somewhere to\r\nhire horses and carts to move next day to town. Profiting by the\r\nabsence of her severe mamma, her daughter Katya, aged twenty, had\r\nfor a long time been sitting in the young man\'s room. Next day the\r\npainter was going away, and she had a great deal to say to him. She\r\nkept talking, talking, and yet she felt that she had not said a\r\ntenth of what she wanted to say. With her eyes full of tears, she\r\ngazed at his shaggy head, gazed at it with rapture and sadness. And\r\nYegor Savvitch was shaggy to a hideous extent, so that he looked\r\nlike a wild animal. His hair hung down to his shoulder-blades, his\r\nbeard grew from his neck, from his nostrils, from his ears; his\r\neyes were lost under his thick overhanging brows. It was all so\r\nthick, so matted, that if a fly or a beetle had been caught in his\r\nhair, it would never have found its way out of this enchanted\r\nthicket. Yegor Savvitch listened to Katya, yawning. He was tired.\r\nWhen Katya began whimpering, he looked severely at her from his\r\noverhanging eyebrows, frowned, and said in a heavy, deep bass:\r\n\r\n"I cannot marry."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Katya asked softly.\r\n\r\n"Because for a painter, and in fact any man who lives for art,\r\nmarriage is out of the question. An artist must be free."\r\n\r\n"But in what way should I hinder you, Yegor Savvitch?"\r\n\r\n"I am not speaking of myself, I am speaking in general. . . . Famous\r\nauthors and painters have never married."\r\n\r\n"And you, too, will be famous--I understand that perfectly. But\r\nput yourself in my place. I am afraid of my mother. She is stern\r\nand irritable. When she knows that you won\'t marry me, and that\r\nit\'s all nothing . . . she\'ll begin to give it to me. Oh, how\r\nwretched I am! And you haven\'t paid for your rooms, either! . . . ."\r\n\r\n"Damn her! I\'ll pay."\r\n\r\nYegor Savvitch got up and began walking to and fro.\r\n\r\n"I ought to be abroad!" he said. And the artist told her that nothing\r\nwas easier than to go abroad. One need do nothing but paint a picture\r\nand sell it.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" Katya assented. "Why haven\'t you painted one in the\r\nsummer?"\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose I can work in a barn like this?" the artist said\r\nill-humouredly. "And where should I get models?"\r\n\r\nSome one banged the door viciously in the storey below. Katya, who\r\nwas expecting her mother\'s return from minute to minute, jumped up\r\nand ran away. The artist was left alone. For a long time he walked\r\nto and fro, threading his way between the chairs and the piles of\r\nuntidy objects of all sorts. He heard the widow rattling the crockery\r\nand loudly abusing the peasants who had asked her two roubles for\r\neach cart. In his disgust Yegor Savvitch stopped before the cupboard\r\nand stared for a long while, frowning at the decanter of vodka.\r\n\r\n"Ah, blast you!" he heard the widow railing at Katya. "Damnation\r\ntake you!"\r\n\r\nThe artist drank a glass of vodka, and the dark cloud in his soul\r\ngradually disappeared, and he felt as though all his inside was\r\nsmiling within him. He began dreaming. . . . His fancy pictured how\r\nhe would become great. He could not imagine his future works but\r\nhe could see distinctly how the papers would talk of him, how the\r\nshops would sell his photographs, with what envy his friends would\r\nlook after him. He tried to picture himself in a magnificent\r\ndrawing-room surrounded by pretty and adoring women; but the picture\r\nwas misty, vague, as he had never in his life seen a drawing-room.\r\nThe pretty and adoring women were not a success either, for, except\r\nKatya, he knew no adoring woman, not even one respectable girl.\r\nPeople who know nothing about life usually picture life from books,\r\nbut Yegor Savvitch knew no books either. He had tried to read Gogol,\r\nbut had fallen asleep on the second page.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t burn, drat the thing!" the widow bawled down below, as\r\nshe set the samovar. "Katya, give me some charcoal!"\r\n\r\nThe dreamy artist felt a longing to share his hopes and dreams with\r\nsome one. He went downstairs into the kitchen, where the stout widow\r\nand Katya were busy about a dirty stove in the midst of charcoal\r\nfumes from the samovar. There he sat down on a bench close to a big\r\npot and began:\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fine thing to be an artist! I can go just where I like, do\r\nwhat I like. One has not to work in an office or in the fields.\r\nI\'ve no superiors or officers over me. . . . I\'m my own superior.\r\nAnd with all that I\'m doing good to humanity!"\r\n\r\nAnd after dinner he composed himself for a "rest." He usually slept\r\ntill the twilight of evening. But this time soon after dinner he\r\nfelt that some one was pulling at his leg. Some one kept laughing\r\nand shouting his name. He opened his eyes and saw his friend Ukleikin,\r\nthe landscape painter, who had been away all the summer in the\r\nKostroma district.\r\n\r\n"Bah!" he cried, delighted. "What do I see?"\r\n\r\nThere followed handshakes, questions.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you brought anything? I suppose you\'ve knocked off\r\nhundreds of sketches?" said Yegor Savvitch, watching Ukleikin taking\r\nhis belongings out of his trunk.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . Yes. I have done something. And how are you getting on?\r\nHave you been painting anything?"\r\n\r\nYegor Savvitch dived behind the bed, and crimson in the face,\r\nextracted a canvas in a frame covered with dust and spider webs.\r\n\r\n"See here. . . . A girl at the window after parting from her\r\nbetrothed. In three sittings. Not nearly finished yet."\r\n\r\nThe picture represented Katya faintly outlined sitting at an open\r\nwindow, from which could be seen a garden and lilac distance.\r\nUkleikin did not like the picture.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . There is air and . . . and there is expression," he\r\nsaid. "There\'s a feeling of distance, but . . . but that bush is\r\nscreaming . . . screaming horribly!"\r\n\r\nThe decanter was brought on to the scene.\r\n\r\nTowards evening Kostyliov, also a promising beginner, an historical\r\npainter, came in to see Yegor Savvitch. He was a friend staying at\r\nthe next villa, and was a man of five-and-thirty. He had long hair,\r\nand wore a blouse with a Shakespeare collar, and had a dignified\r\nmanner. Seeing the vodka, he frowned, complained of his chest, but\r\nyielding to his friends\' entreaties, drank a glass.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve thought of a subject, my friends," he began, getting drunk.\r\n"I want to paint some new . . . Herod or Clepentian, or some\r\nblackguard of that description, you understand, and to contrast\r\nwith him the idea of Christianity. On the one side Rome, you\r\nunderstand, and on the other Christianity. . . . I want to represent\r\nthe spirit, you understand? The spirit!"\r\n\r\nAnd the widow downstairs shouted continually:\r\n\r\n"Katya, give me the cucumbers! Go to Sidorov\'s and get some kvass,\r\nyou jade!"\r\n\r\nLike wolves in a cage, the three friends kept pacing to and fro\r\nfrom one end of the room to the other. They talked without ceasing,\r\ntalked, hotly and genuinely; all three were excited, carried away.\r\nTo listen to them it would seem they had the future, fame, money,\r\nin their hands. And it never occurred to either of them that time\r\nwas passing, that every day life was nearing its close, that they\r\nhad lived at other people\'s expense a great deal and nothing yet\r\nwas accomplished; that they were all bound by the inexorable law\r\nby which of a hundred promising beginners only two or three rise\r\nto any position and all the others draw blanks in the lottery,\r\nperish playing the part of flesh for the cannon. . . . They were\r\ngay and happy, and looked the future boldly in the face!\r\n\r\nAt one o\'clock in the morning Kostyliov said good-bye, and smoothing\r\nout his Shakespeare collar, went home. The landscape painter remained\r\nto sleep at Yegor Savvitch\'s. Before going to bed, Yegor Savvitch\r\ntook a candle and made his way into the kitchen to get a drink of\r\nwater. In the dark, narrow passage Katya was sitting, on a box,\r\nand, with her hands clasped on her knees, was looking upwards. A\r\nblissful smile was straying on her pale, exhausted face, and her\r\neyes were beaming.\r\n\r\n"Is that you? What are you thinking about?" Yegor Savvitch asked\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of how you\'ll be famous," she said in a half-whisper.\r\n"I keep fancying how you\'ll become a famous man. . . . I overheard\r\nall your talk. . . . I keep dreaming and dreaming. . . ."\r\n\r\nKatya went off into a happy laugh, cried, and laid her hands\r\nreverently on her idol\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARTIST\'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIT was six or seven years ago when I was living in one of the\r\ndistricts of the province of T----, on the estate of a young landowner\r\ncalled Byelokurov, who used to get up very early, wear a peasant\r\ntunic, drink beer in the evenings, and continually complain to me\r\nthat he never met with sympathy from any one. He lived in the lodge\r\nin the garden, and I in the old seigniorial house, in a big room\r\nwith columns, where there was no furniture except a wide sofa on\r\nwhich I used to sleep, and a table on which I used to lay out\r\npatience. There was always, even in still weather, a droning noise\r\nin the old Amos stoves, and in thunder-storms the whole house shook\r\nand seemed to be cracking into pieces; and it was rather terrifying,\r\nespecially at night, when all the ten big windows were suddenly lit\r\nup by lightning.\r\n\r\nCondemned by destiny to perpetual idleness, I did absolutely nothing.\r\nFor hours together I gazed out of window at the sky, at the birds,\r\nat the avenue, read everything that was brought me by post, slept.\r\nSometimes I went out of the house and wandered about till late in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nOne day as I was returning home, I accidentally strayed into a place\r\nI did not know. The sun was already sinking, and the shades of\r\nevening lay across the flowering rye. Two rows of old, closely\r\nplanted, very tall fir-trees stood like two dense walls forming a\r\npicturesque, gloomy avenue. I easily climbed over the fence and\r\nwalked along the avenue, slipping over the fir-needles which lay\r\ntwo inches deep on the ground. It was still and dark, and only here\r\nand there on the high tree-tops the vivid golden light quivered and\r\nmade rainbows in the spiders\' webs. There was a strong, almost\r\nstifling smell of resin. Then I turned into a long avenue of limes.\r\nHere, too, all was desolation and age; last year\'s leaves rusted\r\nmournfully under my feet and in the twilight shadows lurked between\r\nthe trees. From the old orchard on the right came the faint, reluctant\r\nnote of the golden oriole, who must have been old too. But at last\r\nthe limes ended. I walked by an old white house of two storeys with\r\na terrace, and there suddenly opened before me a view of a courtyard,\r\na large pond with a bathing-house, a group of green willows, and a\r\nvillage on the further bank, with a high, narrow belfry on which\r\nthere glittered a cross reflecting the setting sun.\r\n\r\nFor a moment it breathed upon me the fascination of something near\r\nand very familiar, as though I had seen that landscape at some time\r\nin my childhood.\r\n\r\nAt the white stone gates which led from the yard to the fields,\r\nold-fashioned solid gates with lions on them, were standing two\r\ngirls. One of them, the elder, a slim, pale, very handsome girl\r\nwith a perfect haystack of chestnut hair and a little obstinate\r\nmouth, had a severe expression and scarcely took notice of me, while\r\nthe other, who was still very young, not more than seventeen or\r\neighteen, and was also slim and pale, with a large mouth and large\r\neyes, looked at me with astonishment as I passed by, said something\r\nin English, and was overcome with embarrassment. And it seemed to\r\nme that these two charming faces, too, had long been familiar to\r\nme. And I returned home feeling as though I had had a delightful\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nOne morning soon afterwards, as Byelokurov and I were walking near\r\nthe house, a carriage drove unexpectedly into the yard, rustling\r\nover the grass, and in it was sitting one of those girls. It was\r\nthe elder one. She had come to ask for subscriptions for some\r\nvillagers whose cottages had been burnt down. Speaking with great\r\nearnestness and precision, and not looking at us, she told us how\r\nmany houses in the village of Siyanovo had been burnt, how many\r\nmen, women, and children were left homeless, and what steps were\r\nproposed, to begin with, by the Relief Committee, of which she was\r\nnow a member. After handing us the subscription list for our\r\nsignatures, she put it away and immediately began to take leave of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n"You have quite forgotten us, Pyotr Petrovitch," she said to\r\nByelokurov as she shook hands with him. "Do come, and if Monsieur\r\nN. (she mentioned my name) cares to make the acquaintance of admirers\r\nof his work, and will come and see us, mother and I will be delighted."\r\n\r\nI bowed.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone Pyotr Petrovitch began to tell me about her. The\r\ngirl was, he said, of good family, and her name was Lidia Voltchaninov,\r\nand the estate on which she lived with her mother and sister, like\r\nthe village on the other side of the pond, was called Shelkovka.\r\nHer father had once held an important position in Moscow, and had\r\ndied with the rank of privy councillor. Although they had ample\r\nmeans, the Voltchaninovs lived on their estate summer and winter\r\nwithout going away. Lidia was a teacher in the Zemstvo school in\r\nher own village, and received a salary of twenty-five roubles a\r\nmonth. She spent nothing on herself but her salary, and was proud\r\nof earning her own living.\r\n\r\n"An interesting family," said Byelokurov. "Let us go over one day.\r\nThey will be delighted to see you."\r\n\r\nOne afternoon on a holiday we thought of the Voltchaninovs, and\r\nwent to Shelkovka to see them. They--the mother and two daughters\r\n--were at home. The mother, Ekaterina Pavlovna, who at one time\r\nhad been handsome, but now, asthmatic, depressed, vague, and\r\nover-feeble for her years, tried to entertain me with conversation\r\nabout painting. Having heard from her daughter that I might come\r\nto Shelkovka, she had hurriedly recalled two or three of my landscapes\r\nwhich she had seen in exhibitions in Moscow, and now asked what I\r\nmeant to express by them. Lidia, or as they called her Lida, talked\r\nmore to Byelokurov than to me. Earnest and unsmiling, she asked him\r\nwhy he was not on the Zemstvo, and why he had not attended any of\r\nits meetings.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not right, Pyotr Petrovitch," she said reproachfully. "It\'s\r\nnot right. It\'s too bad."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, Lida--that\'s true," the mother assented. "It isn\'t\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Our whole district is in the hands of Balagin," Lida went on,\r\naddressing me. "He is the chairman of the Zemstvo Board, and he has\r\ndistributed all the posts in the district among his nephews and\r\nsons-in-law; and he does as he likes. He ought to be opposed. The\r\nyoung men ought to make a strong party, but you see what the young\r\nmen among us are like. It\'s a shame, Pyotr Petrovitch!"\r\n\r\nThe younger sister, Genya, was silent while they were talking of\r\nthe Zemstvo. She took no part in serious conversation. She was not\r\nlooked upon as quite grown up by her family, and, like a child, was\r\nalways called by the nickname of Misuce, because that was what she\r\nhad called her English governess when she was a child. She was all\r\nthe time looking at me with curiosity, and when I glanced at the\r\nphotographs in the album, she explained to me: "That\'s uncle . . .\r\nthat\'s god-father," moving her finger across the photograph. As she\r\ndid so she touched me with her shoulder like a child, and I had a\r\nclose view of her delicate, undeveloped chest, her slender shoulders,\r\nher plait, and her thin little body tightly drawn in by her sash.\r\n\r\nWe played croquet and lawn tennis, we walked about the garden, drank\r\ntea, and then sat a long time over supper. After the huge empty\r\nroom with columns, I felt, as it were, at home in this small snug\r\nhouse where there were no oleographs on the walls and where the\r\nservants were spoken to with civility. And everything seemed to me\r\nyoung and pure, thanks to the presence of Lida and Misuce, and there\r\nwas an atmosphere of refinement over everything. At supper Lida\r\ntalked to Byelokurov again of the Zemstvo, of Balagin, and of school\r\nlibraries. She was an energetic, genuine girl, with convictions,\r\nand it was interesting to listen to her, though she talked a great\r\ndeal and in a loud voice--perhaps because she was accustomed to\r\ntalking at school. On the other hand, Pyotr Petrovitch, who had\r\nretained from his student days the habit of turning every conversation\r\ninto an argument, was tedious, flat, long-winded, and unmistakably\r\nanxious to appear clever and advanced. Gesticulating, he upset a\r\nsauce-boat with his sleeve, making a huge pool on the tablecloth,\r\nbut no one except me appeared to notice it.\r\n\r\nIt was dark and still as we went home.\r\n\r\n"Good breeding is shown, not by not upsetting the sauce, but by not\r\nnoticing it when somebody else does," said Byelokurov, with a sigh.\r\n"Yes, a splendid, intellectual family! I\'ve dropped out of all\r\ndecent society; it\'s dreadful how I\'ve dropped out of it! It\'s all\r\nthrough work, work, work!"\r\n\r\nHe talked of how hard one had to work if one wanted to be a model\r\nfarmer. And I thought what a heavy, sluggish fellow he was! Whenever\r\nhe talked of anything serious he articulated "Er-er" with intense\r\neffort, and worked just as he talked--slowly, always late and\r\nbehind-hand. I had little faith in his business capacity if only\r\nfrom the fact that when I gave him letters to post he carried them\r\nabout in his pocket for weeks together.\r\n\r\n"The hardest thing of all," he muttered as he walked beside me--\r\n"the hardest thing of all is that, work as one may, one meets with\r\nno sympathy from any one. No sympathy!"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI took to going to see the Voltchaninovs. As a rule I sat on the\r\nlower step of the terrace; I was fretted by dissatisfaction with\r\nmyself; I was sorry at the thought of my life passing so rapidly\r\nand uninterestingly, and felt as though I would like to tear out\r\nof my breast the heart which had grown so heavy. And meanwhile I\r\nheard talk on the terrace, the rustling of dresses, the pages of a\r\nbook being turned. I soon grew accustomed to the idea that during\r\nthe day Lida received patients, gave out books, and often went into\r\nthe village with a parasol and no hat, and in the evening talked\r\naloud of the Zemstvo and schools. This slim, handsome, invariably\r\naustere girl, with her small well-cut mouth, always said dryly when\r\nthe conversation turned on serious subjects:\r\n\r\n"That\'s of no interest to you."\r\n\r\nShe did not like me. She disliked me because I was a landscape\r\npainter and did not in my pictures portray the privations of the\r\npeasants, and that, as she fancied, I was indifferent to what she\r\nput such faith in. I remember when I was travelling on the banks\r\nof Lake Baikal, I met a Buriat girl on horseback, wearing a shirt\r\nand trousers of blue Chinese canvas; I asked her if she would sell\r\nme her pipe. While we talked she looked contemptuously at my European\r\nface and hat, and in a moment she was bored with talking to me; she\r\nshouted to her horse and galloped on. And in just the same way Lida\r\ndespised me as an alien. She never outwardly expressed her dislike\r\nfor me, but I felt it, and sitting on the lower step of the terrace,\r\nI felt irritated, and said that doctoring peasants when one was not\r\na doctor was deceiving them, and that it was easy to be benevolent\r\nwhen one had six thousand acres.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her sister Misuce had no cares, and spent her life in\r\ncomplete idleness just as I did. When she got up in the morning she\r\nimmediately took up a book and sat down to read on the terrace in\r\na deep arm-chair, with her feet hardly touching the ground, or hid\r\nherself with her book in the lime avenue, or walked out into the\r\nfields. She spent the whole day reading, poring greedily over her\r\nbook, and only from the tired, dazed look in her eyes and the extreme\r\npaleness of her face one could divine how this continual reading\r\nexhausted her brain. When I arrived she would flush a little, leave\r\nher book, and looking into my face with her big eyes, would tell\r\nme eagerly of anything that had happened--for instance, that the\r\nchimney had been on fire in the servants\' hall, or that one of the\r\nmen had caught a huge fish in the pond. On ordinary days she usually\r\nwent about in a light blouse and a dark blue skirt. We went for\r\nwalks together, picked cherries for making jam, went out in the\r\nboat. When she jumped up to reach a cherry or sculled in the boat,\r\nher thin, weak arms showed through her transparent sleeves. Or I\r\npainted a sketch, and she stood beside me watching rapturously.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday at the end of July I came to the Voltchaninovs about\r\nnine o clock in the morning. I walked about the park, keeping a\r\ngood distance from the house, looking for white mushrooms, of which\r\nthere was a great number that summer, and noting their position so\r\nas to come and pick them afterwards with Genya. There was a warm\r\nbreeze. I saw Genya and her mother both in light holiday dresses\r\ncoming home from church, Genya holding her hat in the wind. Afterwards\r\nI heard them having tea on the terrace.\r\n\r\nFor a careless person like me, trying to find justification for my\r\nperpetual idleness, these holiday mornings in our country-houses\r\nin the summer have always had a particular charm. When the green\r\ngarden, still wet with dew, is all sparkling in the sun and looks\r\nradiant with happiness, when there is a scent of mignonette and\r\noleander near the house, when the young people have just come back\r\nfrom church and are having breakfast in the garden, all so charmingly\r\ndressed and gay, and one knows that all these healthy, well-fed,\r\nhandsome people are going to do nothing the whole long day, one\r\nwishes that all life were like that. Now, too, I had the same\r\nthought, and walked about the garden prepared to walk about like\r\nthat, aimless and unoccupied, the whole day, the whole summer.\r\n\r\nGenya came out with a basket; she had a look in her face as though\r\nshe knew she would find me in the garden, or had a presentiment of\r\nit. We gathered mushrooms and talked, and when she asked a question\r\nshe walked a little ahead so as to see my face.\r\n\r\n"A miracle happened in the village yesterday," she said. "The lame\r\nwoman Pelagea has been ill the whole year. No doctors or medicines\r\ndid her any good; but yesterday an old woman came and whispered\r\nsomething over her, and her illness passed away."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nothing much," I said. "You mustn\'t look for miracles only\r\namong sick people and old women. Isn\'t health a miracle? And life\r\nitself? Whatever is beyond understanding is a miracle."\r\n\r\n"And aren\'t you afraid of what is beyond understanding?"\r\n\r\n"No. Phenomena I don\'t understand I face boldly, and am not overwhelmed\r\nby them. I am above them. Man ought to recognise himself as superior\r\nto lions, tigers, stars, superior to everything in nature, even\r\nwhat seems miraculous and is beyond his understanding, or else he\r\nis not a man, but a mouse afraid of everything."\r\n\r\nGenya believed that as an artist I knew a very great deal, and could\r\nguess correctly what I did not know. She longed for me to initiate\r\nher into the domain of the Eternal and the Beautiful--into that\r\nhigher world in which, as she imagined, I was quite at home. And\r\nshe talked to me of God, of the eternal life, of the miraculous.\r\nAnd I, who could never admit that my self and my imagination would\r\nbe lost forever after death, answered: "Yes, men are immortal";\r\n"Yes, there is eternal life in store for us." And she listened,\r\nbelieved, and did not ask for proofs.\r\n\r\nAs we were going home she stopped suddenly and said:\r\n\r\n"Our Lida is a remarkable person--isn\'t she? I love her very\r\ndearly, and would be ready to give my life for her any minute. But\r\ntell me"--Genya touched my sleeve with her finger--"tell me,\r\nwhy do you always argue with her? Why are you irritated?"\r\n\r\n"Because she is wrong."\r\n\r\nGenya shook her head and tears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"How incomprehensible that is!" she said. At that minute Lida had\r\njust returned from somewhere, and standing with a whip in her hand,\r\na slim, beautiful figure in the sunlight, at the steps, she was\r\ngiving some orders to one of the men. Talking loudly, she hurriedly\r\nreceived two or three sick villagers; then with a busy and anxious\r\nface she walked about the rooms, opening one cupboard after another,\r\nand went upstairs. It was a long time before they could find her\r\nand call her to dinner, and she came in when we had finished our\r\nsoup. All these tiny details I remember with tenderness, and that\r\nwhole day I remember vividly, though nothing special happened. After\r\ndinner Genya lay in a long arm-chair reading, while I sat upon the\r\nbottom step of the terrace. We were silent. The whole sky was\r\novercast with clouds, and it began to spot with fine rain. It was\r\nhot; the wind had dropped, and it seemed as though the day would\r\nnever end. Ekaterina Pavlovna came out on the terrace, looking\r\ndrowsy and carrying a fan.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother," said Genya, kissing her hand, "it\'s not good for you\r\nto sleep in the day."\r\n\r\nThey adored each other. When one went into the garden, the other\r\nwould stand on the terrace, and, looking towards the trees, call\r\n"Aa--oo, Genya!" or "Mother, where are you?" They always said their\r\nprayers together, and had the same faith; and they understood each\r\nother perfectly even when they did not speak. And their attitude\r\nto people was the same. Ekaterina Pavlovna, too, grew quickly used\r\nto me and fond of me, and when I did not come for two or three days,\r\nsent to ask if I were well. She, too, gazed at my sketches with\r\nenthusiasm, and with the same openness and readiness to chatter as\r\nMisuce, she told me what had happened, and confided to me her\r\ndomestic secrets.\r\n\r\nShe had a perfect reverence for her elder daughter. Lida did not\r\ncare for endearments, she talked only of serious matters; she lived\r\nher life apart, and to her mother and sister was as sacred and\r\nenigmatic a person as the admiral, always sitting in his cabin, is\r\nto the sailors.\r\n\r\n"Our Lida is a remarkable person," the mother would often say.\r\n"Isn\'t she?"\r\n\r\nNow, too, while it was drizzling with rain, we talked of Lida.\r\n\r\n"She is a remarkable girl," said her mother, and added in an\r\nundertone, like a conspirator, looking about her timidly: "You\r\nwouldn\'t easily find another like her; only, do you know, I am\r\nbeginning to be a little uneasy. The school, the dispensary, books\r\n--all that\'s very good, but why go to extremes? She is three-and-twenty,\r\nyou know; it\'s time for her to think seriously of herself. With her\r\nbooks and her dispensary she will find life has slipped by without\r\nhaving noticed it. . . . She must be married."\r\n\r\nGenya, pale from reading, with her hair disarranged, raised her\r\nhead and said as it were to herself, looking at her mother:\r\n\r\n"Mother, everything is in God\'s hands."\r\n\r\nAnd again she buried herself in her book.\r\n\r\nByelokurov came in his tunic and embroidered shirt. We played croquet\r\nand tennis, then when it got dark, sat a long time over supper and\r\ntalked again about schools, and about Balagin, who had the whole\r\ndistrict under his thumb. As I went away from the Voltchaninovs\r\nthat evening, I carried away the impression of a long, long idle\r\nday, with a melancholy consciousness that everything ends in this\r\nworld, however long it may be.\r\n\r\nGenya saw us out to the gate, and perhaps because she had been with\r\nme all day, from morning till night, I felt dull without her, and\r\nthat all that charming family were near and dear to me, and for the\r\nfirst time that summer I had a yearning to paint.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, why do you lead such a dreary, colourless life?" I asked\r\nByelokurov as I went home. "My life is dreary, difficult, and\r\nmonotonous because I am an artist, a strange person. From my earliest\r\ndays I\'ve been wrung by envy, self-dissatisfaction, distrust in my\r\nwork. I\'m always poor, I\'m a wanderer, but you--you\'re a healthy,\r\nnormal man, a landowner, and a gentleman. Why do you live in such\r\nan uninteresting way? Why do you get so little out of life? Why\r\nhaven\'t you, for instance, fallen in love with Lida or Genya?"\r\n\r\n"You forget that I love another woman," answered Byelokurov.\r\n\r\nHe was referring to Liubov Ivanovna, the lady who shared the lodge\r\nwith him. Every day I saw this lady, very plump, rotund, and\r\ndignified, not unlike a fat goose, walking about the garden, in the\r\nRussian national dress and beads, always carrying a parasol; and\r\nthe servant was continually calling her in to dinner or to tea.\r\nThree years before she had taken one of the lodges for a summer\r\nholiday, and had settled down at Byelokurov\'s apparently forever.\r\nShe was ten years older than he was, and kept a sharp hand over\r\nhim, so much so that he had to ask her permission when he went out\r\nof the house. She often sobbed in a deep masculine note, and then\r\nI used to send word to her that if she did not leave off, I should\r\ngive up my rooms there; and she left off.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home Byelokurov sat down on the sofa and frowned\r\nthoughtfully, and I began walking up and down the room, conscious\r\nof a soft emotion as though I were in love. I wanted to talk about\r\nthe Voltchaninovs.\r\n\r\n"Lida could only fall in love with a member of the Zemstvo, as\r\ndevoted to schools and hospitals as she is," I said. "Oh, for the\r\nsake of a girl like that one might not only go into the Zemstvo,\r\nbut even wear out iron shoes, like the girl in the fairy tale. And\r\nMisuce? What a sweet creature she is, that Misuce!"\r\n\r\nByelokurov, drawling out "Er--er," began a long-winded disquisition\r\non the malady of the age--pessimism. He talked confidently, in a\r\ntone that suggested that I was opposing him. Hundreds of miles of\r\ndesolate, monotonous, burnt-up steppe cannot induce such deep\r\ndepression as one man when he sits and talks, and one does not know\r\nwhen he will go.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a question of pessimism or optimism," I said irritably;\r\n"its simply that ninety-nine people out of a hundred have no sense."\r\n\r\nByelokurov took this as aimed at himself, was offended, and went\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n"The prince is staying at Malozyomovo, and he asks to be remembered\r\nto you," said Lida to her mother. She had just come in, and was\r\ntaking off her gloves. "He gave me a great deal of interesting news\r\n. . . . He promised to raise the question of a medical relief centre\r\nat Malozyomovo again at the provincial assembly, but he says there\r\nis very little hope of it." And turning to me, she said: "Excuse\r\nme, I always forget that this cannot be interesting to you."\r\n\r\nI felt irritated.\r\n\r\n"Why not interesting to me?" I said, shrugging my shoulders. "You\r\ndo not care to know my opinion, but I assure you the question has\r\ngreat interest for me."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. In my opinion a medical relief centre at Malozyomovo is quite\r\nunnecessary."\r\n\r\nMy irritation infected her; she looked at me, screwing up her eyes,\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n"What is necessary? Landscapes?"\r\n\r\n"Landscapes are not, either. Nothing is."\r\n\r\nShe finished taking off her gloves, and opened the newspaper, which\r\nhad just been brought from the post. A minute later she said quietly,\r\nevidently restraining herself:\r\n\r\n"Last week Anna died in childbirth, and if there had been a medical\r\nrelief centre near, she would have lived. And I think even\r\nlandscape-painters ought to have some opinions on the subject."\r\n\r\n"I have a very definite opinion on that subject, I assure you," I\r\nanswered; and she screened herself with the newspaper, as though\r\nunwilling to listen to me. "To my mind, all these schools, dispensaries,\r\nlibraries, medical relief centres, under present conditions, only\r\nserve to aggravate the bondage of the people. The peasants are\r\nfettered by a great chain, and you do not break the chain, but only\r\nadd fresh links to it--that\'s my view of it."\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to me and smiled ironically, and I went on\r\ntrying to formulate my leading idea.\r\n\r\n"What matters is not that Anna died in childbirth, but that all\r\nthese Annas, Mavras, Pelageas, toil from early morning till dark,\r\nfall ill from working beyond their strength, all their lives tremble\r\nfor their sick and hungry children, all their lives are being\r\ndoctored, and in dread of death and disease, fade and grow old\r\nearly, and die in filth and stench. Their children begin the same\r\nstory over again as soon as they grow up, and so it goes on for\r\nhundreds of years and milliards of men live worse than beasts--\r\nin continual terror, for a mere crust of bread. The whole horror\r\nof their position lies in their never having time to think of their\r\nsouls, of their image and semblance. Cold, hunger, animal terror,\r\na burden of toil, like avalanches of snow, block for them every way\r\nto spiritual activity--that is, to what distinguishes man from\r\nthe brutes and what is the only thing which makes life worth living.\r\nYou go to their help with hospitals and schools, but you don\'t free\r\nthem from their fetters by that; on the contrary, you bind them in\r\ncloser bonds, as, by introducing new prejudices, you increase the\r\nnumber of their wants, to say nothing of the fact that they\'ve got\r\nto pay the Zemstvo for drugs and books, and so toil harder than\r\never."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to argue with you," said Lida, putting down the\r\npaper. "I\'ve heard all that before. I will only say one thing: one\r\ncannot sit with one\'s hands in one\'s lap. It\'s true that we are not\r\nsaving humanity, and perhaps we make a great many mistakes; but we\r\ndo what we can, and we are right. The highest and holiest task for\r\na civilised being is to serve his neighbours, and we try to serve\r\nthem as best we can. You don\'t like it, but one can\'t please every\r\none."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, Lida," said her mother--"that\'s true."\r\n\r\nIn Lida\'s presence she was always a little timid, and looked at her\r\nnervously as she talked, afraid of saying something superfluous or\r\ninopportune. And she never contradicted her, but always assented:\r\n"That\'s true, Lida--that\'s true."\r\n\r\n"Teaching the peasants to read and write, books of wretched precepts\r\nand rhymes, and medical relief centres, cannot diminish either\r\nignorance or the death-rate, just as the light from your windows\r\ncannot light up this huge garden," said I. "You give nothing. By\r\nmeddling in these people\'s lives you only create new wants in them,\r\nand new demands on their labour."\r\n\r\n"Ach! Good heavens! But one must do something!" said Lida with\r\nvexation, and from her tone one could see that she thought my\r\narguments worthless and despised them.\r\n\r\n"The people must be freed from hard physical labour," said I. "We\r\nmust lighten their yoke, let them have time to breathe, that they\r\nmay not spend all their lives at the stove, at the wash-tub, and\r\nin the fields, but may also have time to think of their souls, of\r\nGod--may have time to develop their spiritual capacities. The\r\nhighest vocation of man is spiritual activity--the perpetual\r\nsearch for truth and the meaning of life. Make coarse animal labour\r\nunnecessary for them, let them feel themselves free, and then you\r\nwill see what a mockery these dispensaries and books are. Once a\r\nman recognises his true vocation, he can only be satisfied by\r\nreligion, science, and art, and not by these trifles."\r\n\r\n"Free them from labour?" laughed Lida. "But is that possible?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Take upon yourself a share of their labour. If all of us,\r\ntownspeople and country people, all without exception, would agree\r\nto divide between us the labour which mankind spends on the\r\nsatisfaction of their physical needs, each of us would perhaps need\r\nto work only for two or three hours a day. Imagine that we all,\r\nrich and poor, work only for three hours a day, and the rest of our\r\ntime is free. Imagine further that in order to depend even less\r\nupon our bodies and to labour less, we invent machines to replace\r\nour work, we try to cut down our needs to the minimum. We would\r\nharden ourselves and our children that they should not be afraid\r\nof hunger and cold, and that we shouldn\'t be continually trembling\r\nfor their health like Anna, Mavra, and Pelagea. Imagine that we\r\ndon\'t doctor ourselves, don\'t keep dispensaries, tobacco factories,\r\ndistilleries--what a lot of free time would be left us after all!\r\nAll of us together would devote our leisure to science and art.\r\nJust as the peasants sometimes work, the whole community together\r\nmending the roads, so all of us, as a community, would search for\r\ntruth and the meaning of life, and I am convinced that the truth\r\nwould be discovered very quickly; man would escape from this\r\ncontinual, agonising, oppressive dread of death, and even from death\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n"You contradict yourself, though," said Lida. "You talk about\r\nscience, and are yourself opposed to elementary education."\r\n\r\n"Elementary education when a man has nothing to read but the signs\r\non public houses and sometimes books which he cannot understand--\r\nsuch education has existed among us since the times of Rurik; Gogol\'s\r\nPetrushka has been reading for ever so long, yet as the village was\r\nin the days of Rurik so it has remained. What is needed is not\r\nelementary education, but freedom for a wide development of spiritual\r\ncapacities. What are wanted are not schools, but universities."\r\n\r\n"You are opposed to medicine, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes. It would be necessary only for the study of diseases as natural\r\nphenomena, and not for the cure of them. If one must cure, it should\r\nnot be diseases, but the causes of them. Remove the principal cause\r\n--physical labour, and then there will be no disease. I don\'t\r\nbelieve in a science that cures disease," I went on excitedly. "When\r\nscience and art are real, they aim not at temporary private ends,\r\nbut at eternal and universal--they seek for truth and the meaning\r\nof life, they seek for God, for the soul, and when they are tied\r\ndown to the needs and evils of the day, to dispensaries and libraries,\r\nthey only complicate and hamper life. We have plenty of doctors,\r\nchemists, lawyers, plenty of people can read and write, but we are\r\nquite without biologists, mathematicians, philosophers, poets. The\r\nwhole of our intelligence, the whole of our spiritual energy, is\r\nspent on satisfying temporary, passing needs. Scientific men,\r\nwriters, artists, are hard at work; thanks to them, the conveniences\r\nof life are multiplied from day to day. Our physical demands increase,\r\nyet truth is still a long way off, and man still remains the most\r\nrapacious and dirty animal; everything is tending to the degeneration\r\nof the majority of mankind, and the loss forever of all fitness for\r\nlife. In such conditions an artist\'s work has no meaning, and the\r\nmore talented he is, the stranger and the more unintelligible is\r\nhis position, as when one looks into it, it is evident that he is\r\nworking for the amusement of a rapacious and unclean animal, and\r\nis supporting the existing order. And I don\'t care to work and I\r\nwon\'t work. . . . Nothing is any use; let the earth sink to perdition!"\r\n\r\n"Misuce, go out of the room!" said Lida to her sister, apparently\r\nthinking my words pernicious to the young girl.\r\n\r\nGenya looked mournfully at her mother and sister, and went out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"These are the charming things people say when they want to justify\r\ntheir indifference," said Lida. "It is easier to disapprove of\r\nschools and hospitals, than to teach or heal."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, Lida--that\'s true," the mother assented.\r\n\r\n"You threaten to give up working," said Lida. "You evidently set a\r\nhigh value on your work. Let us give up arguing; we shall never\r\nagree, since I put the most imperfect dispensary or library of which\r\nyou have just spoken so contemptuously on a higher level than any\r\nlandscape." And turning at once to her mother, she began speaking\r\nin quite a different tone: "The prince is very much changed, and\r\nmuch thinner than when he was with us last. He is being sent to\r\nVichy."\r\n\r\nShe told her mother about the prince in order to avoid talking to\r\nme. Her face glowed, and to hide her feeling she bent low over the\r\ntable as though she were short-sighted, and made a show of reading\r\nthe newspaper. My presence was disagreeable to her. I said good-bye\r\nand went home.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt was quite still out of doors; the village on the further side\r\nof the pond was already asleep; there was not a light to be seen,\r\nand only the stars were faintly reflected in the pond. At the gate\r\nwith the lions on it Genya was standing motionless, waiting to\r\nescort me.\r\n\r\n"Every one is asleep in the village," I said to her, trying to make\r\nout her face in the darkness, and I saw her mournful dark eyes fixed\r\nupon me. "The publican and the horse-stealers are asleep, while we,\r\nwell-bred people, argue and irritate each other."\r\n\r\nIt was a melancholy August night--melancholy because there was\r\nalready a feeling of autumn; the moon was rising behind a purple\r\ncloud, and it shed a faint light upon the road and on the dark\r\nfields of winter corn by the sides. From time to time a star fell.\r\nGenya walked beside me along the road, and tried not to look at the\r\nsky, that she might not see the falling stars, which for some reason\r\nfrightened her.\r\n\r\n"I believe you are right," she said, shivering with the damp night\r\nair. "If people, all together, could devote themselves to spiritual\r\nends, they would soon know everything."\r\n\r\n"Of course. We are higher beings, and if we were really to recognise\r\nthe whole force of human genius and lived only for higher ends, we\r\nshould in the end become like gods. But that will never be--mankind\r\nwill degenerate till no traces of genius remain."\r\n\r\nWhen the gates were out of sight, Genya stopped and shook hands\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," she said, shivering; she had nothing but her blouse\r\nover her shoulders and was shrinking with cold. "Come to-morrow."\r\n\r\nI felt wretched at the thought of being left alone, irritated and\r\ndissatisfied with myself and other people; and I, too, tried not\r\nto look at the falling stars. "Stay another minute," I said to her,\r\n"I entreat you."\r\n\r\nI loved Genya. I must have loved her because she met me when I came\r\nand saw me off when I went away; because she looked at me tenderly\r\nand enthusiastically. How touchingly beautiful were her pale face,\r\nslender neck, slender arms, her weakness, her idleness, her reading.\r\nAnd intelligence? I suspected in her intelligence above the average.\r\nI was fascinated by the breadth of her views, perhaps because they\r\nwere different from those of the stern, handsome Lida, who disliked\r\nme. Genya liked me, because I was an artist. I had conquered her\r\nheart by my talent, and had a passionate desire to paint for her\r\nsake alone; and I dreamed of her as of my little queen who with me\r\nwould possess those trees, those fields, the mists, the dawn, the\r\nexquisite and beautiful scenery in the midst of which I had felt\r\nmyself hopelessly solitary and useless.\r\n\r\n"Stay another minute," I begged her. "I beseech you."\r\n\r\nI took off my overcoat and put it over her chilly shoulders; afraid\r\nof looking ugly and absurd in a man\'s overcoat, she laughed, threw\r\nit off, and at that instant I put my arms round her and covered her\r\nface, shoulders, and hands with kisses.\r\n\r\n"Till to-morrow," she whispered, and softly, as though afraid of\r\nbreaking upon the silence of the night, she embraced me. "We have\r\nno secrets from one another. I must tell my mother and my sister\r\nat once. . . . It\'s so dreadful! Mother is all right; mother likes\r\nyou--but Lida!"\r\n\r\nShe ran to the gates.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye!" she called.\r\n\r\nAnd then for two minutes I heard her running. I did not want to go\r\nhome, and I had nothing to go for. I stood still for a little time\r\nhesitating, and made my way slowly back, to look once more at the\r\nhouse in which she lived, the sweet, simple old house, which seemed\r\nto be watching me from the windows of its upper storey, and\r\nunderstanding all about it. I walked by the terrace, sat on the\r\nseat by the tennis ground, in the dark under the old elm-tree, and\r\nlooked from there at the house. In the windows of the top storey\r\nwhere Misuce slept there appeared a bright light, which changed to\r\na soft green--they had covered the lamp with the shade. Shadows\r\nbegan to move. . . . I was full of tenderness, peace, and satisfaction\r\nwith myself--satisfaction at having been able to be carried away\r\nby my feelings and having fallen in love, and at the same time I\r\nfelt uncomfortable at the thought that only a few steps away from\r\nme, in one of the rooms of that house there was Lida, who disliked\r\nand perhaps hated me. I went on sitting there wondering whether\r\nGenya would come out; I listened and fancied I heard voices talking\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour passed. The green light went out, and the shadows\r\nwere no longer visible. The moon was standing high above the house,\r\nand lighting up the sleeping garden and the paths; the dahlias and\r\nthe roses in front of the house could be seen distinctly, and looked\r\nall the same colour. It began to grow very cold. I went out of the\r\ngarden, picked up my coat on the road, and slowly sauntered home.\r\n\r\nWhen next day after dinner I went to the Voltchaninovs, the glass\r\ndoor into the garden was wide open. I sat down on the terrace,\r\nexpecting Genya every minute, to appear from behind the flower-beds\r\non the lawn, or from one of the avenues, or that I should hear her\r\nvoice from the house. Then I walked into the drawing-room, the\r\ndining-room. There was not a soul to be seen. From the dining-room\r\nI walked along the long corridor to the hall and back. In this\r\ncorridor there were several doors, and through one of them I heard\r\nthe voice of Lida:\r\n\r\n"\'God . . . sent . . . a crow,\'" she said in a loud, emphatic\r\nvoice, probably dictating--"\'God sent a crow a piece of cheese\r\n. . . . A crow . . . a piece of cheese.\' . . . Who\'s there?" she\r\ncalled suddenly, hearing my steps.\r\n\r\n"It\'s I."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Excuse me, I cannot come out to you this minute; I\'m giving\r\nDasha her lesson."\r\n\r\n"Is Ekaterina Pavlovna in the garden?"\r\n\r\n"No, she went away with my sister this morning to our aunt in the\r\nprovince of Penza. And in the winter they will probably go abroad,"\r\nshe added after a pause. "\'God sent . . . the crow . . . a piece\r\n. . . of cheese.\' . . . Have you written it?"\r\n\r\nI went into the hall, and stared vacantly at the pond and the\r\nvillage, and the sound reached me of "A piece of cheese. . . . God\r\nsent the crow a piece of cheese."\r\n\r\nAnd I went back by the way I had come here for the first time--\r\nfirst from the yard into the garden past the house, then into the\r\navenue of lime-trees. . . . At this point I was overtaken by a small\r\nboy who gave me a note:\r\n\r\n"I told my sister everything and she insists on my parting from\r\nyou," I read. "I could not wound her by disobeying. God will give\r\nyou happiness. Forgive me. If only you knew how bitterly my mother\r\nand I are crying!"\r\n\r\nThen there was the dark fir avenue, the broken-down fence. . . .\r\nOn the field where then the rye was in flower and the corncrakes\r\nwere calling, now there were cows and hobbled horses. On the slope\r\nthere were bright green patches of winter corn. A sober workaday\r\nfeeling came over me and I felt ashamed of all I had said at the\r\nVoltchaninovs\', and felt bored with life as I had been before. When\r\nI got home, I packed and set off that evening for Petersburg.\r\n\r\n                             ----\r\n\r\nI never saw the Voltchaninovs again. Not long ago, on my way to the\r\nCrimea, I met Byelokurov in the train. As before, he was wearing a\r\njerkin and an embroidered shirt, and when I asked how he was, he\r\nreplied that, God be praised, he was well. We began talking. He had\r\nsold his old estate and bought another smaller one, in the name of\r\nLiubov Ivanovna. He could tell me little about the Voltchaninovs.\r\nLida, he said, was still living in Shelkovka and teaching in the\r\nschool; she had by degrees succeeded in gathering round her a circle\r\nof people sympathetic to her who made a strong party, and at the\r\nlast election had turned out Balagin, who had till then had the\r\nwhole district under his thumb. About Genya he only told me that\r\nshe did not live at home, and that he did not know where she was.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to forget the old house, and only sometimes when I\r\nam painting or reading I suddenly, apropos of nothing, remember the\r\ngreen light in the window, the sound of my footsteps as I walked\r\nhome through the fields in the night, with my heart full of love,\r\nrubbing my hands in the cold. And still more rarely, at moments\r\nwhen I am sad and depressed by loneliness, I have dim memories, and\r\nlittle by little I begin to feel that she is thinking of me, too\r\n--that she is waiting for me, and that we shall meet. . . .\r\n\r\nMisuce, where are you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE YEARS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIT was dark, and already lights had begun to gleam here and there\r\nin the houses, and a pale moon was rising behind the barracks at\r\nthe end of the street. Laptev was sitting on a bench by the gate\r\nwaiting for the end of the evening service at the Church of St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul. He was reckoning that Yulia Sergeyevna would\r\npass by on her way from the service, and then he would speak to\r\nher, and perhaps spend the whole evening with her.\r\n\r\nHe had been sitting there for an hour and a half already, and all\r\nthat time his imagination had been busy picturing his Moscow rooms,\r\nhis Moscow friends, his man Pyotr, and his writing-table. He gazed\r\nhalf wonderingly at the dark, motionless trees, and it seemed strange\r\nto him that he was living now, not in his summer villa at Sokolniki,\r\nbut in a provincial town in a house by which a great herd of cattle\r\nwas driven every morning and evening, accompanied by terrible clouds\r\nof dust and the blowing of a horn. He thought of long conversations\r\nin which he had taken part quite lately in Moscow--conversations\r\nin which it had been maintained that one could live without love,\r\nthat passionate love was an obsession, that finally there is no\r\nsuch love, but only a physical attraction between the sexes--and\r\nso on, in the same style; he remembered them and thought mournfully\r\nthat if he were asked now what love was, he could not have found\r\nan answer.\r\n\r\nThe service was over, the people began to appear. Laptev strained\r\nhis eyes gazing at the dark figures. The bishop had been driven by\r\nin his carriage, the bells had stopped ringing, and the red and\r\ngreen lights in the belfry were one after another extinguished--\r\nthere had been an illumination, as it was dedication day--but the\r\npeople were still coming out, lingering, talking, and standing under\r\nthe windows. But at last Laptev heard a familiar voice, his heart\r\nbegan beating violently, and he was overcome with despair on seeing\r\nthat Yulia Sergeyevna was not alone, but walking with two ladies.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful, awful!" he whispered, feeling jealous. "It\'s awful!"\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the lane, she stopped to say good-bye to the ladies,\r\nand while doing so glanced at Laptev.\r\n\r\n"I was coming to see you," he said. "I\'m coming for a chat with\r\nyour father. Is he at home?"\r\n\r\n"Most likely," she answered. "It\'s early for him to have gone to\r\nthe club."\r\n\r\nThere were gardens all along the lane, and a row of lime-trees\r\ngrowing by the fence cast a broad patch of shadow in the moonlight,\r\nso that the gate and the fences were completely plunged in darkness\r\non one side, from which came the sounds of women whispering, smothered\r\nlaughter, and someone playing softly on a balalaika. There was a\r\nfragrance of lime-flowers and of hay. This fragrance and the murmur\r\nof the unseen whispers worked upon Laptev. He was all at once\r\noverwhelmed with a passionate longing to throw his arms round his\r\ncompanion, to shower kisses on her face, her hands, her shoulders,\r\nto burst into sobs, to fall at her feet and to tell her how long\r\nhe had been waiting for her. A faint scarcely perceptible scent of\r\nincense hung about her; and that scent reminded him of the time\r\nwhen he, too, believed in God and used to go to evening service,\r\nand when he used to dream so much of pure romantic love. And it\r\nseemed to him that, because this girl did not love him, all possibility\r\nof the happiness he had dreamed of then was lost to him forever.\r\n\r\nShe began speaking sympathetically of the illness of his sister,\r\nNina Fyodorovna. Two months before his sister had undergone an\r\noperation for cancer, and now every one was expecting a return of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n"I went to see her this morning," said Yulia Sergeyevna, "and it\r\nseemed to me that during the last week she has, not exactly grown\r\nthin, but has, as it were, faded."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," Laptev agreed. "There\'s no return of the symptoms, but\r\nevery day I notice she grows weaker and weaker, and is wasting\r\nbefore my eyes. I don\'t understand what\'s the matter with her."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear! And how strong she used to be, plump and rosy!" said Yulia\r\nSergeyevna after a moment\'s silence. "Every one here used to call\r\nher the Moscow lady. How she used to laugh! On holidays she used\r\nto dress up like a peasant girl, and it suited her so well."\r\n\r\nDoctor Sergey Borisovitch was at home; he was a stout, red-faced\r\nman, wearing a long coat that reached below his knees, and looking\r\nas though he had short legs. He was pacing up and down his study,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, and humming to himself in an undertone,\r\n"Ru-ru-ru-ru." His grey whiskers looked unkempt, and his hair was\r\nunbrushed, as though he had just got out of bed. And his study with\r\npillows on the sofa, with stacks of papers in the corners, and with\r\na dirty invalid poodle lying under the table, produced the same\r\nimpression of unkemptness and untidiness as himself.\r\n\r\n"M. Laptev wants to see you," his daughter said to him, going into\r\nhis study.\r\n\r\n"Ru-ru-ru-ru," he hummed louder than ever, and turning into the\r\ndrawing-room, gave his hand to Laptev, and asked: "What good news\r\nhave you to tell me?"\r\n\r\nIt was dark in the drawing-room. Laptev, still standing with his\r\nhat in his hand, began apologising for disturbing him; he asked\r\nwhat was to be done to make his sister sleep at night, and why she\r\nwas growing so thin; and he was embarrassed by the thought that he\r\nhad asked those very questions at his visit that morning.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," he said, "wouldn\'t it be as well to send for some\r\nspecialist on internal diseases from Moscow? What do you think of\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and made a vague gesture\r\nwith his hands.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he was offended. He was a very huffy man, prone\r\nto take offence, and always ready to suspect that people did not\r\nbelieve in him, that he was not recognised or properly respected,\r\nthat his patients exploited him, and that his colleagues showed him\r\nill-will. He was always jeering at himself, saying that fools like\r\nhim were only made for the public to ride rough-shod over them.\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna lighted the lamp. She was tired out with the\r\nservice, and that was evident from her pale, exhausted face, and\r\nher weary step. She wanted to rest. She sat down on the sofa, put\r\nher hands on her lap, and sank into thought. Laptev knew that he\r\nwas ugly, and now he felt as though he were conscious of his ugliness\r\nall over his body. He was short, thin, with ruddy cheeks, and his\r\nhair had grown so thin that his head felt cold. In his expression\r\nthere was none of that refined simplicity which makes even rough,\r\nugly faces attractive; in the society of women, he was awkward,\r\nover-talkative, affected. And now he almost despised himself for\r\nit. He must talk that Yulia Sergeyevna might not be bored in his\r\ncompany. But what about? About his sister\'s illness again?\r\n\r\nAnd he began to talk about medicine, saying what is usually said.\r\nHe approved of hygiene, and said that he had long ago wanted to\r\nfound a night-refuge in Moscow--in fact, he had already calculated\r\nthe cost of it. According to his plan the workmen who came in the\r\nevening to the night-refuge were to receive a supper of hot cabbage\r\nsoup with bread, a warm, dry bed with a rug, and a place for drying\r\ntheir clothes and their boots.\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna was usually silent in his presence, and in a strange\r\nway, perhaps by the instinct of a lover, he divined her thoughts\r\nand intentions. And now, from the fact that after the evening service\r\nshe had not gone to her room to change her dress and drink tea, he\r\ndeduced that she was going to pay some visit elsewhere.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m in no hurry with the night-refuge," he went on, speaking\r\nwith vexation and irritability, and addressing the doctor, who\r\nlooked at him, as it were, blankly and in perplexity, evidently\r\nunable to understand what induced him to raise the question of\r\nmedicine and hygiene. "And most likely it will be a long time, too,\r\nbefore I make use of our estimate. I fear our night-shelter will\r\nfall into the hands of our pious humbugs and philanthropic ladies,\r\nwho always ruin any undertaking."\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna got up and held out her hand to Laptev.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," she said, "it\'s time for me to go. Please give my love\r\nto your sister."\r\n\r\n"Ru-ru-ru-ru," hummed the doctor. "Ru-ru-ru-ru."\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna went out, and after staying a little longer, Laptev\r\nsaid good-bye to the doctor and went home. When a man is dissatisfied\r\nand feels unhappy, how trivial seem to him the shapes of the\r\nlime-trees, the shadows, the clouds, all the beauties of nature,\r\nso complacent, so indifferent! By now the moon was high up in the\r\nsky, and the clouds were scudding quickly below. "But how na\xefve and\r\nprovincial the moon is, how threadbare and paltry the clouds!"\r\nthought Laptev. He felt ashamed of the way he had talked just now\r\nabout medicine, and the night-refuge. He felt with horror that next\r\nday he would not have will enough to resist trying to see her and\r\ntalk to her again, and would again be convinced that he was nothing\r\nto her. And the day after--it would be the same. With what object?\r\nAnd how and when would it all end?\r\n\r\nAt home he went in to see his sister. Nina Fyodorovna still looked\r\nstrong and gave the impression of being a well-built, vigorous\r\nwoman, but her striking pallor made her look like a corpse, especially\r\nwhen, as now, she was lying on her back with her eyes closed; her\r\neldest daughter Sasha, a girl of ten years old, was sitting beside\r\nher reading aloud from her reading-book.\r\n\r\n"Alyosha has come," the invalid said softly to herself.\r\n\r\nThere had long been established between Sasha and her uncle a tacit\r\ncompact, to take turns in sitting with the patient. On this occasion\r\nSasha closed her reading-book, and without uttering a word, went\r\nsoftly out of the room. Laptev took an historical novel from the\r\nchest of drawers, and looking for the right page, sat down and began\r\nreading it aloud.\r\n\r\nNina Fyodorovna was born in Moscow of a merchant family. She and\r\nher two brothers had spent their childhood and early youth, living\r\nat home in Pyatnitsky Street. Their childhood was long and wearisome;\r\nher father treated her sternly, and had even on two or three occasions\r\nflogged her, and her mother had had a long illness and died. The\r\nservants were coarse, dirty, and hypocritical; the house was\r\nfrequented by priests and monks, also hypocritical; they ate and\r\ndrank and coarsely flattered her father, whom they did not like.\r\nThe boys had the good-fortune to go to school, while Nina was left\r\npractically uneducated. All her life she wrote an illegible scrawl,\r\nand had read nothing but historical novels. Seventeen years ago,\r\nwhen she was twenty-two, on a summer holiday at Himki, she made the\r\nacquaintance of her present husband, a landowner called Panaurov,\r\nhad fallen in love with him, and married him secretly against her\r\nfather\'s will. Panaurov, a handsome, rather impudent fellow, who\r\nwhistled and lighted his cigarette from the holy lamp, struck the\r\nfather as an absolutely worthless person. And when the son-in-law\r\nbegan in his letters demanding a dowry, the old man wrote to his\r\ndaughter that he would send her furs, silver, and various articles\r\nthat had been left at her mother\'s death, as well as thirty thousand\r\nroubles, but without his paternal blessing. Later he sent another\r\ntwenty thousand. This money, as well as the dowry, was spent; the\r\nestate had been sold and Panaurov moved with his family to the town\r\nand got a job in a provincial government office. In the town he\r\nformed another tie, and had a second family, and this was the subject\r\nof much talk, as his illicit family was not a secret.\r\n\r\nNina Fyodorovna adored her husband. And now, listening to the\r\nhistorical novel, she was thinking how much she had gone through\r\nin her life, how much she had suffered, and that if any one were\r\nto describe her life it would make a very pathetic story. As the\r\ntumour was in her breast, she was persuaded that love and her\r\ndomestic grief were the cause of her illness, and that jealousy and\r\ntears had brought her to her hopeless state.\r\n\r\nAt last Alexey Fyodorovitch closed the book and said:\r\n\r\n"That\'s the end, and thank God for it. To-morrow we\'ll begin a new\r\none."\r\n\r\nNina Fyodorovna laughed. She had always been given to laughter, but\r\nof late Laptev had begun to notice that at moments her mind seemed\r\nweakened by illness, and she would laugh at the smallest trifle,\r\nand even without any cause at all.\r\n\r\n"Yulia came before dinner while you were out," she said. "So far\r\nas I can see, she hasn\'t much faith in her papa. \'Let papa go on\r\ntreating you,\' she said, \'but write in secret to the holy elder to\r\npray for you, too.\' There is a holy man somewhere here. Yulia forgot\r\nher parasol here; you must take it to her to-morrow," she went on\r\nafter a brief pause. "No, when the end comes, neither doctors nor\r\nholy men are any help."\r\n\r\n"Nina, why can\'t you sleep at night?" Laptev asked, to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I don\'t go to sleep--that\'s all. I lie and think."\r\n\r\n"What do you think about, dear?"\r\n\r\n"About the children, about you . . . about my life. I\'ve gone through\r\na great deal, Alyosha, you know. When one begins to remember and\r\nremember. . . . My God!" She laughed. "It\'s no joke to have borne\r\nfive children as I have, to have buried three. . . Sometimes I was\r\nexpecting to be confined while my Grigory Nikolaitch would be sitting\r\nat that very time with another woman. There would be no one to send\r\nfor the doctor or the midwife. I would go into the passage or the\r\nkitchen for the servant, and there Jews, tradesmen, moneylenders,\r\nwould be waiting for him to come home. My head used to go round\r\n. . . . He did not love me, though he never said so openly. Now I\'ve\r\ngrown calmer--it doesn\'t weigh on my heart; but in old days, when\r\nI was younger, it hurt me--ach! how it hurt me, darling! Once--\r\nwhile we were still in the country--I found him in the garden\r\nwith a lady, and I walked away. . . I walked on aimlessly, and I\r\ndon\'t know how, but I found myself in the church porch. I fell on\r\nmy knees: \'Queen of Heaven!\' I said. And it was night, the moon was\r\nshining. . . ."\r\n\r\nShe was exhausted, she began gasping for breath. Then, after resting\r\na little, she took her brother\'s hand and went on in a weak, toneless\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"How kind you are, Alyosha! . . . And how clever! . . . What a good\r\nman you\'ve grown up into!"\r\n\r\nAt midnight Laptev said good-night to her, and as he went away he\r\ntook with him the parasol that Yulia Sergeyevna had forgotten. In\r\nspite of the late hour, the servants, male and female, were drinking\r\ntea in the dining-room. How disorderly! The children were not in\r\nbed, but were there in the dining-room, too. They were all talking\r\nsoftly in undertones, and had not noticed that the lamp was smoking\r\nand would soon go out. All these people, big and little, were\r\ndisturbed by a whole succession of bad omens and were in an oppressed\r\nmood. The glass in the hall had been broken, the samovar had been\r\nbuzzing every day, and, as though on purpose, was even buzzing now.\r\nThey were describing how a mouse had jumped out of Nina Fyodorovna\'s\r\nboot when she was dressing. And the children were quite aware of\r\nthe terrible significance of these omens. The elder girl, Sasha, a\r\nthin little brunette, was sitting motionless at the table, and her\r\nface looked scared and woebegone, while the younger, Lida, a chubby\r\nfair child of seven, stood beside her sister looking from under her\r\nbrows at the light.\r\n\r\nLaptev went downstairs to his own rooms in the lower storey, where\r\nunder the low ceilings it was always close and smelt of geraniums.\r\nIn his sitting-room, Panaurov, Nina Fyodorovna\'s husband, was sitting\r\nreading the newspaper. Laptev nodded to him and sat down opposite.\r\nBoth sat still and said nothing. They used to spend whole evenings\r\nlike this without speaking, and neither of them was in the least\r\nput out by this silence.\r\n\r\nThe little girls came down from upstairs to say good-night.\r\nDeliberately and in silence, Panaurov made the sign of the cross\r\nover them several times, and gave them his hand to kiss. They dropped\r\ncurtsies, and then went up to Laptev, who had to make the sign of\r\nthe cross and give them his hand to kiss also. This ceremony with\r\nthe hand-kissing and curtsying was repeated every evening.\r\n\r\nWhen the children had gone out Panaurov laid aside the newspaper\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very lively in our God-fearing town! I must confess, my\r\ndear fellow," he added with a sigh, "I\'m very glad that at last\r\nyou\'ve found some distraction."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked Laptev.\r\n\r\n"I saw you coming out of Dr. Byelavin\'s just now. I expect you don\'t\r\ngo there for the sake of the papa."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said Laptev, and he blushed.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course not. And by the way, you wouldn\'t find such another\r\nold brute as that papa if you hunted by daylight with a candle. You\r\ncan\'t imagine what a foul, stupid, clumsy beast he is! You cultured\r\npeople in the capitals are still interested in the provinces only\r\non the lyrical side, only from the _paysage_ and _Poor Anton_ point\r\nof view, but I can assure you, my boy, there\'s nothing logical about\r\nit; there\'s nothing but barbarism, meanness, and nastiness--that\'s\r\nall. Take the local devotees of science--the local intellectuals,\r\nso to speak. Can you imagine there are here in this town twenty-eight\r\ndoctors? They\'ve all made their fortunes, and they are living in\r\nhouses of their own, and meanwhile the population is in just as\r\nhelpless a condition as ever. Here, Nina had to have an operation,\r\nquite an ordinary one really, yet we were obliged to get a surgeon\r\nfrom Moscow; not one doctor here would undertake it. It\'s beyond\r\nall conception. They know nothing, they understand nothing. They\r\ntake no interest in anything. Ask them, for instance, what cancer\r\nis--what it is, what it comes from."\r\n\r\nAnd Panaurov began to explain what cancer was. He was a specialist\r\non all scientific subjects, and explained from a scientific point\r\nof view everything that was discussed. But he explained it all in\r\nhis own way. He had a theory of his own about the circulation of\r\nthe blood, about chemistry, about astronomy. He talked slowly,\r\nsoftly, convincingly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beyond all conception," he pronounced in an imploring voice,\r\nscrewing up his eyes, sighing languidly, and smiling as graciously\r\nas a king, and it was evident that he was very well satisfied with\r\nhimself, and never gave a thought to the fact that he was fifty.\r\n\r\n"I am rather hungry," said Laptev. "I should like something savoury."\r\n\r\n"Well, that can easily be managed."\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards Laptev and his brother-in-law were sitting\r\nupstairs in the dining-room having supper. Laptev had a glass of\r\nvodka, and then began drinking wine. Panaurov drank nothing. He\r\nnever drank, and never gambled, yet in spite of that he had squandered\r\nall his own and his wife\'s property, and had accumulated debts. To\r\nsquander so much in such a short time, one must have, not passions,\r\nbut a special talent. Panaurov liked dainty fare, liked a handsome\r\ndinner service, liked music after dinner, speeches, bowing footmen,\r\nto whom he would carelessly fling tips of ten, even twenty-five\r\nroubles. He always took part in all lotteries and subscriptions,\r\nsent bouquets to ladies of his acquaintance on their birthdays,\r\nbought cups, stands for glasses, studs, ties, walking-sticks, scents,\r\ncigarette-holders, pipes, lap-dogs, parrots, Japanese bric-\xe0-brac,\r\nantiques; he had silk nightshirts, and a bedstead made of ebony\r\ninlaid with mother-of-pearl. His dressing-gown was a genuine Bokhara,\r\nand everything was to correspond; and on all this there went every\r\nday, as he himself expressed, "a deluge" of money.\r\n\r\nAt supper he kept sighing and shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"Yes, everything on this earth has an end," he said softly, screwing\r\nup his dark eyes. "You will fall in love and suffer. You will fall\r\nout of love; you\'ll be deceived, for there is no woman who will not\r\ndeceive; you will suffer, will be brought to despair, and will be\r\nfaithless too. But the time will come when all this will be a memory,\r\nand when you will reason about it coldly and look upon it as utterly\r\ntrivial. . . ."\r\n\r\nLaptev, tired, a little drunk, looked at his handsome head, his\r\nclipped black beard, and seemed to understand why women so loved\r\nthis pampered, conceited, and physically handsome creature.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Panaurov did not stay in the house, but went off to\r\nhis other lodgings. Laptev went out to see him on his way. Panaurov\r\nwas the only man in the town who wore a top-hat, and his elegant,\r\ndandified figure, his top-hat and tan gloves, beside the grey fences,\r\nthe pitiful little houses, with their three windows and the thickets\r\nof nettles, always made a strange and mournful impression.\r\n\r\nAfter saying good-bye to him Laptev returned home without hurrying.\r\nThe moon was shining brightly; one could distinguish every straw\r\non the ground, and Laptev felt as though the moonlight were caressing\r\nhis bare head, as though some one were passing a feather over his\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n"I love!" he pronounced aloud, and he had a sudden longing to run\r\nto overtake Panaurov, to embrace him, to forgive him, to make him\r\na present of a lot of money, and then to run off into the open\r\ncountry, into a wood, to run on and on without looking back.\r\n\r\nAt home he saw lying on the chair the parasol Yulia Sergeyevna had\r\nforgotten; he snatched it up and kissed it greedily. The parasol\r\nwas a silk one, no longer new, tied round with old elastic. The\r\nhandle was a cheap one, of white bone. Laptev opened it over him,\r\nand he felt as though there were the fragrance of happiness about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe settled himself more comfortably in his chair, and still keeping\r\nhold of the parasol, began writing to Moscow to one of his friends:\r\n\r\n"DEAR PRECIOUS KOSTYA,\r\n\r\n"Here is news for you: I\'m in love again! I say _again_, because\r\nsix years ago I fell in love with a Moscow actress, though I didn\'t\r\neven succeed in making her acquaintance, and for the last year and\r\na half I have been living with a certain person you know--a woman\r\nneither young nor good-looking. Ah, my dear boy, how unlucky I am\r\nin love. I\'ve never had any success with women, and if I say _again_\r\nit\'s simply because it\'s rather sad and mortifying to acknowledge\r\neven to myself that my youth has passed entirely without love, and\r\nthat I\'m in love in a real sense now for the first time in my life,\r\nat thirty-four. Let it stand that I love _again_.\r\n\r\n"If only you knew what a girl she was! She couldn\'t be called a\r\nbeauty--she has a broad face, she is very thin, but what a wonderful\r\nexpression of goodness she has when she smiles! When she speaks,\r\nher voice is as clear as a bell. She never carries on a conversation\r\nwith me--I don\'t know her; but when I\'m beside her I feel she\'s\r\na striking, exceptional creature, full of intelligence and lofty\r\naspirations. She is religious, and you cannot imagine how deeply\r\nthis touches me and exalts her in my eyes. On that point I am ready\r\nto argue with you endlessly. You may be right, to your thinking;\r\nbut, still, I love to see her praying in church. She is a provincial,\r\nbut she was educated in Moscow. She loves our Moscow; she dresses\r\nin the Moscow style, and I love her for that--love her, love her\r\n. . . . I see you frowning and getting up to read me a long lecture\r\non what love is, and what sort of woman one can love, and what sort\r\none cannot, and so on, and so on. But, dear Kostya, before I was\r\nin love I, too, knew quite well what love was.\r\n\r\n"My sister thanks you for your message. She often recalls how she\r\nused to take Kostya Kotchevoy to the preparatory class, and never\r\nspeaks of you except as _poor Kostya_, as she still thinks of you\r\nas the little orphan boy she remembers. And so, poor orphan, I\'m\r\nin love. While it\'s a secret, don\'t say anything to a \'certain\r\nperson.\' I think it will all come right of itself, or, as the footman\r\nsays in Tolstoy, will \'come round.\'"\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his letter Laptev went to bed. He was so tired\r\nthat he couldn\'t keep his eyes open, but for some reason he could\r\nnot get to sleep; the noise in the street seemed to prevent him.\r\nThe cattle were driven by to the blowing of a horn, and soon\r\nafterwards the bells began ringing for early mass. At one minute a\r\ncart drove by creaking; at the next, he heard the voice of some\r\nwoman going to market. And the sparrows twittered the whole time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe next morning was a cheerful one; it was a holiday. At ten o\'clock\r\nNina Fyodorovna, wearing a brown dress and with her hair neatly\r\narranged, was led into the drawing-room, supported on each side.\r\nThere she walked about a little and stood by the open window, and\r\nher smile was broad and na\xefve, and, looking at her, one recalled a\r\nlocal artist, a great drunkard, who wanted her to sit to him for a\r\npicture of the Russian carnival. And all of them--the children,\r\nthe servants, her brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and she herself--\r\nwere suddenly convinced, that she was certainly going to get well.\r\nWith shrieks of laughter the children ran after their uncle, chasing\r\nhim and catching him, and filling the house with noise.\r\n\r\nPeople called to ask how she was, brought her holy bread, told her\r\nthat in almost all the churches they were offering up prayers for\r\nher that day. She had been conspicuous for her benevolence in the\r\ntown, and was liked. She was very ready with her charity, like her\r\nbrother Alexey, who gave away his money freely, without considering\r\nwhether it was necessary to give it or not. Nina Fyodorovna used\r\nto pay the school fees for poor children; used to give away tea,\r\nsugar, and jam to old women; used to provide trousseaux for poor\r\nbrides; and if she picked up a newspaper, she always looked first\r\nof all to see if there were any appeals for charity or a paragraph\r\nabout somebody\'s being in a destitute condition.\r\n\r\nShe was holding now in her hand a bundle of notes, by means of which\r\nvarious poor people, her prot\xe9g\xe9s, had procured goods from a grocer\'s\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nThey had been sent her the evening before by the shopkeeper with a\r\nrequest for the payment of the total--eighty-two roubles.\r\n\r\n"My goodness, what a lot they\'ve had! They\'ve no conscience!" she\r\nsaid, deciphering with difficulty her ugly handwriting. "It\'s no\r\njoke! Eighty-two roubles! I declare I won\'t pay it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay it to-day," said Laptev.\r\n\r\n"Why should you? Why should you?" cried Nina Fyodorovna in agitation.\r\n"It\'s quite enough for me to take two hundred and fifty every month\r\nfrom you and our brother. God bless you!" she added, speaking softly,\r\nso as not to be overheard by the servants.\r\n\r\n"Well, but I spend two thousand five hundred a month," he said. "I\r\ntell you again, dear: you have just as much right to spend it as I\r\nor Fyodor. Do understand that, once for all. There are three of us,\r\nand of every three kopecks of our father\'s money, one belongs to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nBut Nina Fyodorovna did not understand, and her expression looked\r\nas though she were mentally solving some very difficult problem.\r\nAnd this lack of comprehension in pecuniary matters, always made\r\nLaptev feel uneasy and troubled. He suspected that she had private\r\ndebts in addition which worried her and of which she scrupled to\r\ntell him.\r\n\r\nThen came the sound of footsteps and heavy breathing; it was the\r\ndoctor coming up the stairs, dishevelled and unkempt as usual.\r\n\r\n"Ru-ru-ru," he was humming. "Ru-ru."\r\n\r\nTo avoid meeting him, Laptev went into the dining-room, and then\r\nwent downstairs to his own room. It was clear to him that to get\r\non with the doctor and to drop in at his house without formalities\r\nwas impossible; and to meet the "old brute," as Panaurov called\r\nhim, was distasteful. That was why he so rarely saw Yulia. He\r\nreflected now that the father was not at home, that if he were to\r\ntake Yulia Sergeyevna her parasol, he would be sure to find her at\r\nhome alone, and his heart ached with joy. Haste, haste!\r\n\r\nHe took the parasol and, violently agitated, flew on the wings of\r\nlove. It was hot in the street. In the big courtyard of the doctor\'s\r\nhouse, overgrown with coarse grass and nettles, some twenty urchins\r\nwere playing ball. These were all the children of working-class\r\nfamilies who tenanted the three disreputable-looking lodges, which\r\nthe doctor was always meaning to have done up, though he put it off\r\nfrom year to year. The yard resounded with ringing, healthy voices.\r\nAt some distance on one side, Yulia Sergeyevna was standing at her\r\nporch, her hands folded, watching the game.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning!" Laptev called to her.\r\n\r\nShe looked round. Usually he saw her indifferent, cold, or tired\r\nas she had been the evening before. Now her face looked full of\r\nlife and frolic, like the faces of the boys who were playing ball.\r\n\r\n"Look, they never play so merrily in Moscow," she said, going to\r\nmeet him. "There are no such big yards there, though; they\'ve no\r\nplace to run there. Papa has only just gone to you," she added,\r\nlooking round at the children.\r\n\r\n"I know; but I\'ve not come to see him, but to see you," said Laptev,\r\nadmiring her youthfulness, which he had not noticed till then, and\r\nseemed only that day to have discovered in her; it seemed to him\r\nas though he were seeing her slender white neck with the gold chain\r\nfor the first time. "I\'ve come to see you . . ." he repeated. "My\r\nsister has sent you your parasol; you forgot it yesterday."\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand to take the parasol, but he pressed it to his\r\nbosom and spoke passionately, without restraint, yielding again to\r\nthe sweet ecstasy he had felt the night before, sitting under the\r\nparasol.\r\n\r\n"I entreat you, give it me. I shall keep it in memory of you . . .\r\nof our acquaintance. It\'s so wonderful!"\r\n\r\n"Take it," she said, and blushed; "but there\'s nothing wonderful\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in ecstasy, in silence, not knowing what to say.\r\n\r\n"Why am I keeping you here in the heat?" she said after a brief\r\npause, laughing. "Let us go indoors."\r\n\r\n"I am not disturbing you?"\r\n\r\nThey went into the hall. Yulia Sergeyevna ran upstairs, her white\r\ndress with blue flowers on it rustling as she went.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t be disturbed," she answered, stopping on the landing. "I\r\nnever do anything. Every day is a holiday for me, from morning till\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"What you say is inconceivable to me," he said, going up to her.\r\n"I grew up in a world in which every one without exception, men and\r\nwomen alike, worked hard every day."\r\n\r\n"But if one has nothing to do?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"One has to arrange one\'s life under such conditions, that work is\r\ninevitable. There can be no clean and happy life without work."\r\n\r\nAgain he pressed the parasol to his bosom, and to his own surprise\r\nspoke softly, in a voice unlike his own:\r\n\r\n"If you would consent to be my wife I would give everything--I\r\nwould give everything. There\'s no price I would not pay, no sacrifice\r\nI would not make."\r\n\r\nShe started and looked at him with wonder and alarm.\r\n\r\n"What are you saying!" she brought out, turning pale. "It\'s impossible,\r\nI assure you. Forgive me."\r\n\r\nThen with the same rustle of her skirts she went up higher, and\r\nvanished through the doorway.\r\n\r\nLaptev grasped what this meant, and his mood was transformed,\r\ncompletely, abruptly, as though a light in his soul had suddenly\r\nbeen extinguished. Filled with the shame of a man humiliated, of a\r\nman who is disdained, who is not liked, who is distasteful, perhaps\r\ndisgusting, who is shunned, he walked out of the house.\r\n\r\n"I would give everything," he thought, mimicking himself as he went\r\nhome through the heat and recalled the details of his declaration.\r\n"I would give everything--like a regular tradesman. As though she\r\nwanted your _everything_!"\r\n\r\nAll he had just said seemed to him repulsively stupid. Why had he\r\nlied, saying that he had grown up in a world where every one worked,\r\nwithout exception? Why had he talked to her in a lecturing tone\r\nabout a clean and happy life? It was not clever, not interesting;\r\nit was false--false in the Moscow style. But by degrees there\r\nfollowed that mood of indifference into which criminals sink after\r\na severe sentence. He began thinking that, thank God! everything\r\nwas at an end and that the terrible uncertainty was over; that now\r\nthere was no need to spend whole days in anticipation, in pining,\r\nin thinking always of the same thing. Now everything was clear; he\r\nmust give up all hope of personal happiness, live without desires,\r\nwithout hopes, without dreams, or expectations, and to escape that\r\ndreary sadness which he was so sick of trying to soothe, he could\r\nbusy himself with other people\'s affairs, other people\'s happiness,\r\nand old age would come on imperceptibly, and life would reach its\r\nend--and nothing more was wanted. He did not care, he wished for\r\nnothing, and could reason about it coolly, but there was a sort of\r\nheaviness in his face especially under his eyes, his forehead felt\r\ndrawn tight like elastic--and tears were almost starting into his\r\neyes. Feeling weak all over, he lay down on his bed, and in five\r\nminutes was sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe proposal Laptev had made so suddenly threw Yulia Sergeyevna\r\ninto despair.\r\n\r\nShe knew Laptev very little, had made his acquaintance by chance;\r\nhe was a rich man, a partner in the well-known Moscow firm of "Fyodor\r\nLaptev and Sons"; always serious, apparently clever, and anxious\r\nabout his sister\'s illness. It had seemed to her that he took no\r\nnotice of her whatever, and she did not care about him in the least\r\n--and then all of a sudden that declaration on the stairs, that\r\npitiful, ecstatic face. . . .\r\n\r\nThe offer had overwhelmed her by its suddenness and by the fact\r\nthat the word wife had been uttered, and by the necessity of rejecting\r\nit. She could not remember what she had said to Laptev, but she\r\nstill felt traces of the sudden, unpleasant feeling with which she\r\nhad rejected him. He did not attract her; he looked like a shopman;\r\nhe was not interesting; she could not have answered him except with\r\na refusal, and yet she felt uncomfortable, as though she had done\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n"My God! without waiting to get into the room, on the stairs," she\r\nsaid to herself in despair, addressing the ikon which hung over her\r\npillow; "and no courting beforehand, but so strangely, so\r\noddly. . . ."\r\n\r\nIn her solitude her agitation grew more intense every hour, and it\r\nwas beyond her strength to master this oppressive feeling alone.\r\nShe needed some one to listen to her story and to tell her that she\r\nhad done right. But she had no one to talk to. She had lost her\r\nmother long before; she thought her father a queer man, and could\r\nnot talk to him seriously. He worried her with his whims, his extreme\r\nreadiness to take offence, and his meaningless gestures; and as\r\nsoon as one began to talk to him, he promptly turned the conversation\r\non himself. And in her prayer she was not perfectly open, because\r\nshe did not know for certain what she ought to pray for.\r\n\r\nThe samovar was brought in. Yulia Sergeyevna, very pale and tired,\r\nlooking dejected, came into the dining-room to make tea--it was\r\none of her duties--and poured out a glass for her father. Sergey\r\nBorisovitch, in his long coat that reached below his knees, with\r\nhis red face and unkempt hair, walked up and down the room with his\r\nhands in his pockets, pacing, not from corner to corner, but backwards\r\nand forwards at random, like a wild beast in its cage. He would\r\nstand still by the table, sip his glass of tea with relish, and\r\npace about again, lost in thought.\r\n\r\n"Laptev made me an offer to-day," said Yulia Sergeyevna, and she\r\nflushed crimson.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at her and did not seem to understand.\r\n\r\n"Laptev?" he queried. "Panaurov\'s brother-in-law?"\r\n\r\nHe was fond of his daughter; it was most likely that she would\r\nsooner or later be married, and leave him, but he tried not to think\r\nabout that. He was afraid of being alone, and for some reason\r\nfancied, that if he were left alone in that great house, he would\r\nhave an apoplectic stroke, but he did not like to speak of this\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m delighted to hear it," he said, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n"I congratulate you with all my heart. It offers you a splendid\r\nopportunity for leaving me, to your great satisfaction. And I quite\r\nunderstand your feelings. To live with an old father, an invalid,\r\nhalf crazy, must be very irksome at your age. I quite understand\r\nyou. And the sooner I\'m laid out and in the devil\'s clutches, the\r\nbetter every one will be pleased. I congratulate you with all my\r\nheart."\r\n\r\n"I refused him."\r\n\r\nThe doctor felt relieved, but he was unable to stop himself and\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n"I wonder, I\'ve long wondered, why I\'ve not yet been put into a\r\nmadhouse--why I\'m still wearing this coat instead of a strait-waistcoat?\r\nI still have faith in justice, in goodness. I am a fool, an idealist,\r\nand nowadays that\'s insanity, isn\'t it? And how do they repay me\r\nfor my honesty? They almost throw stones at me and ride rough-shod\r\nover me. And even my nearest kith and kin do nothing but try to get\r\nthe better of me. It\'s high time the devil fetched an old fool like\r\nme. . . ."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no talking to you like a rational being!" said Yulia.\r\n\r\nShe got up from the table impulsively, and went to her room in great\r\nwrath, remembering how often her father had been unjust to her. But\r\na little while afterwards she felt sorry for her father, too, and\r\nwhen he was going to the club she went downstairs with him, and\r\nshut the door after him. It was a rough and stormy night; the door\r\nshook with the violence of the wind, and there were draughts in all\r\ndirections in the passage, so that the candle was almost blown out.\r\nIn her own domain upstairs Yulia Sergeyevna went the round of all\r\nthe rooms, making the sign of the cross over every door and window;\r\nthe wind howled, and it sounded as though some one were walking on\r\nthe roof. Never had it been so dreary, never had she felt so lonely.\r\n\r\nShe asked herself whether she had done right in rejecting a man,\r\nsimply because his appearance did not attract her. It was true he\r\nwas a man she did not love, and to marry him would mean renouncing\r\nforever her dreams, her conceptions of happiness in married life,\r\nbut would she ever meet the man of whom she dreamed, and would he\r\nlove her? She was twenty-one already. There were no eligible young\r\nmen in the town. She pictured all the men she knew--government\r\nclerks, schoolmasters, officers, and some of them were married\r\nalready, and their domestic life was conspicuous for its dreariness\r\nand triviality; others were uninteresting, colourless, unintelligent,\r\nimmoral. Laptev was, anyway, a Moscow man, had taken his degree at\r\nthe university, spoke French. He lived in the capital, where there\r\nwere lots of clever, noble, remarkable people; where there was noise\r\nand bustle, splendid theatres, musical evenings, first-rate\r\ndressmakers, confectioners. . . . In the Bible it was written that\r\na wife must love her husband, and great importance was given to\r\nlove in novels, but wasn\'t there exaggeration in it? Was it out of\r\nthe question to enter upon married life without love? It was said,\r\nof course, that love soon passed away, and that nothing was left\r\nbut habit, and that the object of married life was not to be found\r\nin love, nor in happiness, but in duties, such as the bringing up\r\nof one\'s children, the care of one\'s household, and so on. And\r\nperhaps what was meant in the Bible was love for one\'s husband as\r\none\'s neighbour, respect for him, charity.\r\n\r\nAt night Yulia Sergeyevna read the evening prayers attentively,\r\nthen knelt down, and pressing her hands to her bosom, gazing at the\r\nflame of the lamp before the ikon, said with feeling:\r\n\r\n"Give me understanding, Holy Mother, our Defender! Give me\r\nunderstanding, O Lord!"\r\n\r\nShe had in the course of her life come across elderly maiden ladies,\r\npoor and of no consequence in the world, who bitterly repented and\r\nopenly confessed their regret that they had refused suitors in the\r\npast. Would not the same thing happen to her? Had not she better\r\ngo into a convent or become a Sister of Mercy?\r\n\r\nShe undressed and got into bed, crossing herself and crossing the\r\nair around her. Suddenly the bell rang sharply and plaintively in\r\nthe corridor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God!" she said, feeling a nervous irritation all over her\r\nat the sound. She lay still and kept thinking how poor this provincial\r\nlife was in events, monotonous and yet not peaceful. One was\r\nconstantly having to tremble, to feel apprehensive, angry or guilty,\r\nand in the end one\'s nerves were so strained, that one was afraid\r\nto peep out of the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nA little while afterwards the bell rang just as sharply again. The\r\nservant must have been asleep and had not heard. Yulia Sergeyevna\r\nlighted a candle, and feeling vexed with the servant, began with a\r\nshiver to dress, and when she went out into the corridor, the maid\r\nwas already closing the door downstairs.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was the master, but it\'s some one from a patient,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna went back to her room. She took a pack of cards\r\nout of the chest of drawers, and decided that if after shuffling\r\nthe cards well and cutting, the bottom card turned out to be a red\r\none, it would mean _yes_--that is, she would accept Laptev\'s\r\noffer; and that if it was a black, it would mean _no_. The card\r\nturned out to be the ten of spades.\r\n\r\nThat relieved her mind--she fell asleep; but in the morning, she\r\nwas wavering again between _yes_ and _no_, and she was dwelling on\r\nthe thought that she could, if she chose, change her life. The\r\nthought harassed her, she felt exhausted and unwell; but yet, soon\r\nafter eleven, she dressed and went to see Nina Fyodorovna. She\r\nwanted to see Laptev: perhaps now he would seem more attractive to\r\nher; perhaps she had been wrong about him hitherto. . . .\r\n\r\nShe found it hard to walk against the wind. She struggled along,\r\nholding her hat on with both hands, and could see nothing for the\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGoing into his sister\'s room, and seeing to his surprise Yulia\r\nSergeyevna, Laptev had again the humiliating sensation of a man who\r\nfeels himself an object of repulsion. He concluded that if after\r\nwhat had happened yesterday she could bring herself so easily to\r\nvisit his sister and meet him, it must be because she was not\r\nconcerned about him, and regarded him as a complete nonentity. But\r\nwhen he greeted her, and with a pale face and dust under her eyes\r\nshe looked at him mournfully and remorsefully, he saw that she,\r\ntoo, was miserable.\r\n\r\nShe did not feel well. She only stayed ten minutes, and began saying\r\ngood-bye. And as she went out she said to Laptev:\r\n\r\n"Will you see me home, Alexey Fyodorovitch?"\r\n\r\nThey walked along the street in silence, holding their hats, and\r\nhe, walking a little behind, tried to screen her from the wind. In\r\nthe lane it was more sheltered, and they walked side by side.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me if I was not nice yesterday;" and her voice quavered\r\nas though she were going to cry. "I was so wretched! I did not sleep\r\nall night."\r\n\r\n"I slept well all night," said Laptev, without looking at her; "but\r\nthat doesn\'t mean that I was happy. My life is broken. I\'m deeply\r\nunhappy, and after your refusal yesterday I go about like a man\r\npoisoned. The most difficult thing was said yesterday. To-day I\r\nfeel no embarrassment and can talk to you frankly. I love you more\r\nthan my sister, more than my dead mother. . . . I can live without\r\nmy sister, and without my mother, and I have lived without them,\r\nbut life without you--is meaningless to me; I can\'t face it. . . ."\r\n\r\nAnd now too, as usual, he guessed her intention.\r\n\r\nHe realised that she wanted to go back to what had happened the day\r\nbefore, and with that object had asked him to accompany her, and\r\nnow was taking him home with her. But what could she add to her\r\nrefusal? What new idea had she in her head? From everything, from\r\nher glances, from her smile, and even from her tone, from the way\r\nshe held her head and shoulders as she walked beside him, he saw\r\nthat, as before, she did not love him, that he was a stranger to\r\nher. What more did she want to say?\r\n\r\nDoctor Sergey Borisovitch was at home.\r\n\r\n"You are very welcome. I\'m always glad to see you, Fyodor Alexeyitch,"\r\nhe said, mixing up his Christian name and his father\'s. "Delighted,\r\ndelighted!"\r\n\r\nHe had never been so polite before, and Laptev saw that he knew of\r\nhis offer; he did not like that either. He was sitting now in the\r\ndrawing-room, and the room impressed him strangely, with its poor,\r\ncommon decorations, its wretched pictures, and though there were\r\narm-chairs in it, and a huge lamp with a shade over it, it still\r\nlooked like an uninhabited place, a huge barn, and it was obvious\r\nthat no one could feel at home in such a room, except a man like\r\nthe doctor. The next room, almost twice as large, was called the\r\nreception-room, and in it there were only rows of chairs, as though\r\nfor a dancing class. And while Laptev was sitting in the drawing-room\r\ntalking to the doctor about his sister, he began to be tortured by\r\na suspicion. Had not Yulia Sergeyevna been to his sister Nina\'s,\r\nand then brought him here to tell him that she would accept him?\r\nOh, how awful it was! But the most awful thing of all was that his\r\nsoul was capable of such a suspicion. And he imagined how the father\r\nand the daughter had spent the evening, and perhaps the night before,\r\nin prolonged consultation, perhaps dispute, and at last had come\r\nto the conclusion that Yulia had acted thoughtlessly in refusing a\r\nrich man. The words that parents use in such cases kept ringing in\r\nhis ears:\r\n\r\n"It is true you don\'t love him, but think what good you could do!"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was going out to see patients. Laptev would have gone\r\nwith him, but Yulia Sergeyevna said:\r\n\r\n"I beg you to stay."\r\n\r\nShe was distressed and dispirited, and told herself now that to\r\nrefuse an honourable, good man who loved her, simply because he was\r\nnot attractive, especially when marrying him would make it possible\r\nfor her to change her mode of life, her cheerless, monotonous, idle\r\nlife in which youth was passing with no prospect of anything better\r\nin the future--to refuse him under such circumstances was madness,\r\ncaprice and folly, and that God might even punish her for it.\r\n\r\nThe father went out. When the sound of his steps had died away, she\r\nsuddenly stood up before Laptev and said resolutely, turning horribly\r\nwhite as she did so:\r\n\r\n"I thought for a long time yesterday, Alexey Fyodorovitch. . . . I\r\naccept your offer."\r\n\r\nHe bent down and kissed her hand. She kissed him awkwardly on the\r\nhead with cold lips.\r\n\r\nHe felt that in this love scene the chief thing--her love--was\r\nlacking, and that there was a great deal that was not wanted; and\r\nhe longed to cry out, to run away, to go back to Moscow at once.\r\nBut she was close to him, and she seemed to him so lovely, and he\r\nwas suddenly overcome by passion. He reflected that it was too late\r\nfor deliberation now; he embraced her passionately, and muttered\r\nsome words, calling her _thou_; he kissed her on the neck, and then\r\non the cheek, on the head. . . .\r\n\r\nShe walked away to the window, dismayed by these demonstrations,\r\nand both of them were already regretting what they had said and\r\nboth were asking themselves in confusion:\r\n\r\n"Why has this happened?"\r\n\r\n"If only you knew how miserable I am!" she said, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he said, going up to her, wringing his hands too. "My\r\ndear, for God\'s sake, tell me--what is it? Only tell the truth,\r\nI entreat you--nothing but the truth!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pay any attention to it," she said, and forced herself to\r\nsmile. "I promise you I\'ll be a faithful, devoted wife. . . . Come\r\nthis evening."\r\n\r\nSitting afterwards with his sister and reading aloud an historical\r\nnovel, he recalled it all and felt wounded that his splendid, pure,\r\nrich feeling was met with such a shallow response. He was not loved,\r\nbut his offer had been accepted--in all probability because he\r\nwas rich: that is, what was thought most of in him was what he\r\nvalued least of all in himself. It was quite possible that Yulia,\r\nwho was so pure and believed in God, had not once thought of his\r\nmoney; but she did not love him--did not love him, and evidently\r\nshe had interested motives, vague, perhaps, and not fully thought\r\nout--still, it was so. The doctor\'s house with its common furniture\r\nwas repulsive to him, and he looked upon the doctor himself as a\r\nwretched, greasy miser, a sort of operatic Gaspard from "Les Cloches\r\nde Corneville." The very name "Yulia" had a vulgar sound. He imagined\r\nhow he and his Yulia would stand at their wedding, in reality\r\ncomplete strangers to one another, without a trace of feeling on\r\nher side, just as though their marriage had been made by a professional\r\nmatchmaker; and the only consolation left him now, as commonplace\r\nas the marriage itself, was the reflection that he was not the\r\nfirst, and would not be the last; that thousands of people were\r\nmarried like that; and that with time, when Yulia came to know him\r\nbetter, she would perhaps grow fond of him.\r\n\r\n"Romeo and Juliet!" he said, as he shut the novel, and he laughed.\r\n"I am Romeo, Nina. You may congratulate me. I made an offer to Yulia\r\nByelavin to-day."\r\n\r\nNina Fyodorovna thought he was joking, but when she believed it,\r\nshe began to cry; she was not pleased at the news.\r\n\r\n"Well, I congratulate you," she said. "But why is it so sudden?"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s not sudden. It\'s been going on since March, only you don\'t\r\nnotice anything. . . . I fell in love with her last March when I\r\nmade her acquaintance here, in your rooms."\r\n\r\n"I thought you would marry some one in our Moscow set," said Nina\r\nFyodorovna after a pause. "Girls in our set are simpler. But what\r\nmatters, Alyosha, is that you should be happy--that matters most.\r\nMy Grigory Nikolaitch did not love me, and there\'s no concealing\r\nit; you can see what our life is. Of course any woman may love you\r\nfor your goodness and your brains, but, you see, Yulitchka is a\r\ngirl of good family from a high-class boarding-school; goodness and\r\nbrains are not enough for her. She is young, and, you, Alyosha, are\r\nnot so young, and are not good-looking."\r\n\r\nTo soften the last words, she stroked his head and said:\r\n\r\n"You\'re not good-looking, but you\'re a dear."\r\n\r\nShe was so agitated that a faint flush came into her cheeks, and\r\nshe began discussing eagerly whether it would be the proper thing\r\nfor her to bless Alyosha with the ikon at the wedding. She was, she\r\nreasoned, his elder sister, and took the place of his mother; and\r\nshe kept trying to convince her dejected brother that the wedding\r\nmust be celebrated in proper style, with pomp and gaiety, so that\r\nno one could find fault with it.\r\n\r\nThen he began going to the Byelavins\' as an accepted suitor, three\r\nor four times a day; and now he never had time to take Sasha\'s place\r\nand read aloud the historical novel. Yulia used to receive him in\r\nher two rooms, which were at a distance from the drawing-room and\r\nher father\'s study, and he liked them very much. The walls in them\r\nwere dark; in the corner stood a case of ikons; and there was a\r\nsmell of good scent and of the oil in the holy lamp. Her rooms were\r\nat the furthest end of the house; her bedstead and dressing-table\r\nwere shut off by a screen. The doors of the bookcase were covered\r\non the inside with a green curtain, and there were rugs on the\r\nfloor, so that her footsteps were noiseless--and from this he\r\nconcluded that she was of a reserved character, and that she liked\r\na quiet, peaceful, secluded life. In her own home she was treated\r\nas though she were not quite grown up. She had no money of her own,\r\nand sometimes when they were out for walks together, she was overcome\r\nwith confusion at not having a farthing. Her father allowed her\r\nvery little for dress and books, hardly ten pounds a year. And,\r\nindeed, the doctor himself had not much money in spite of his good\r\npractice. He played cards every night at the club, and always lost.\r\nMoreover, he bought mortgaged houses through a building society,\r\nand let them. The tenants were irregular in paying the rent, but\r\nhe was convinced that such speculations were profitable. He had\r\nmortgaged his own house in which he and his daughter were living,\r\nand with the money so raised had bought a piece of waste ground,\r\nand had already begun to build on it a large two-storey house,\r\nmeaning to mortgage it, too, as soon as it was finished.\r\n\r\nLaptev now lived in a sort of cloud, feeling as though he were not\r\nhimself, but his double, and did many things which he would never\r\nhave brought himself to do before. He went three or four times to\r\nthe club with the doctor, had supper with him, and offered him money\r\nfor house-building. He even visited Panaurov at his other establishment.\r\nIt somehow happened that Panaurov invited him to dinner, and without\r\nthinking, Laptev accepted. He was received by a lady of five-and-thirty.\r\nShe was tall and thin, with hair touched with grey, and black\r\neyebrows, apparently not Russian. There were white patches of powder\r\non her face. She gave him a honeyed smile and pressed his hand\r\njerkily, so that the bracelets on her white hands tinkled. It seemed\r\nto Laptev that she smiled like that because she wanted to conceal\r\nfrom herself and from others that she was unhappy. He also saw two\r\nlittle girls, aged five and three, who had a marked likeness to\r\nSasha. For dinner they had milk-soup, cold veal, and chocolate. It\r\nwas insipid and not good; but the table was splendid, with gold\r\nforks, bottles of Soyer, and cayenne pepper, an extraordinary bizarre\r\ncruet-stand, and a gold pepper-pot.\r\n\r\nIt was only as he was finishing the milk-soup that Laptev realised\r\nhow very inappropriate it was for him to be dining there. The lady\r\nwas embarrassed, and kept smiling, showing her teeth. Panaurov\r\nexpounded didactically what being in love was, and what it was due\r\nto.\r\n\r\n"We have in it an example of the action of electricity," he said\r\nin French, addressing the lady. "Every man has in his skin microscopic\r\nglands which contain currents of electricity. If you meet with a\r\nperson whose currents are parallel with your own, then you get\r\nlove."\r\n\r\nWhen Laptev went home and his sister asked him where he had been\r\nhe felt awkward, and made no answer.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself in a false position right up to the time of the\r\nwedding. His love grew more intense every day, and Yulia seemed to\r\nhim a poetic and exalted creature; but, all the same, there was no\r\nmutual love, and the truth was that he was buying her and she was\r\nselling herself. Sometimes, thinking things over, he fell into\r\ndespair and asked himself: should he run away? He did not sleep for\r\nnights together, and kept thinking how he should meet in Moscow the\r\nlady whom he had called in his letters "a certain person," and what\r\nattitude his father and his brother, difficult people, would take\r\ntowards his marriage and towards Yulia. He was afraid that his\r\nfather would say something rude to Yulia at their first meeting.\r\nAnd something strange had happened of late to his brother Fyodor.\r\nIn his long letters he had taken to writing of the importance of\r\nhealth, of the effect of illness on the mental condition, of the\r\nmeaning of religion, but not a word about Moscow or business. These\r\nletters irritated Laptev, and he thought his brother\'s character\r\nwas changing for the worse.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was in September. The ceremony took place at the Church\r\nof St. Peter and St. Paul, after mass, and the same day the young\r\ncouple set off for Moscow. When Laptev and his wife, in a black\r\ndress with a long train, already looking not a girl but a married\r\nwoman, said good-bye to Nina Fyodorovna, the invalid\'s face worked,\r\nbut there was no tear in her dry eyes. She said:\r\n\r\n"If--which God forbid--I should die, take care of my little\r\ngirls."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I promise!" answered Yulia Sergeyevna, and her lips and eyelids\r\nbegan quivering too.\r\n\r\n"I shall come to see you in October," said Laptev, much moved. "You\r\nmust get better, my darling."\r\n\r\nThey travelled in a special compartment. Both felt depressed and\r\nuncomfortable. She sat in the corner without taking off her hat,\r\nand made a show of dozing, and he lay on the seat opposite, and he\r\nwas disturbed by various thoughts--of his father, of "a certain\r\nperson," whether Yulia would like her Moscow flat. And looking at\r\nhis wife, who did not love him, he wondered dejectedly "why this\r\nhad happened."\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Laptevs had a wholesale business in Moscow, dealing in fancy\r\ngoods: fringe, tape, trimmings, crochet cotton, buttons, and so on.\r\nThe gross receipts reached two millions a year; what the net profit\r\nwas, no one knew but the old father. The sons and the clerks estimated\r\nthe profits at approximately three hundred thousand, and said that\r\nit would have been a hundred thousand more if the old man had not\r\n"been too free-handed"--that is, had not allowed credit\r\nindiscriminately. In the last ten years alone the bad debts had\r\nmounted up to the sum of a million; and when the subject was referred\r\nto, the senior clerk would wink slyly and deliver himself of sentences\r\nthe meaning of which was not clear to every one:\r\n\r\n"The psychological sequences of the age."\r\n\r\nTheir chief commercial operations were conducted in the town market\r\nin a building which was called the warehouse. The entrance to the\r\nwarehouse was in the yard, where it was always dark, and smelt of\r\nmatting and where the dray-horses were always stamping their hoofs\r\non the asphalt. A very humble-looking door, studded with iron, led\r\nfrom the yard into a room with walls discoloured by damp and scrawled\r\nover with charcoal, lighted up by a narrow window covered by an\r\niron grating. Then on the left was another room larger and cleaner\r\nwith an iron stove and a couple of chairs, though it, too, had a\r\nprison window: this was the office, and from it a narrow stone\r\nstaircase led up to the second storey, where the principal room\r\nwas. This was rather a large room, but owing to the perpetual\r\ndarkness, the low-pitched ceiling, the piles of boxes and bales,\r\nand the numbers of men that kept flitting to and fro in it, it made\r\nas unpleasant an impression on a newcomer as the others. In the\r\noffices on the top storey the goods lay in bales, in bundles and\r\nin cardboard boxes on the shelves; there was no order nor neatness\r\nin the arrangement of it, and if crimson threads, tassels, ends of\r\nfringe, had not peeped out here and there from holes in the paper\r\nparcels, no one could have guessed what was being bought and sold\r\nhere. And looking at these crumpled paper parcels and boxes, no one\r\nwould have believed that a million was being made out of such trash,\r\nand that fifty men were employed every day in this warehouse, not\r\ncounting the buyers.\r\n\r\nWhen at midday, on the day after his arrival at Moscow, Laptev went\r\ninto the warehouse, the workmen packing the goods were hammering\r\nso loudly that in the outer room and the office no one heard him\r\ncome in. A postman he knew was coming down the stairs with a bundle\r\nof letters in his hand; he was wincing at the noise, and he did not\r\nnotice Laptev either. The first person to meet him upstairs was his\r\nbrother Fyodor Fyodorovitch, who was so like him that they passed\r\nfor twins. This resemblance always reminded Laptev of his own\r\npersonal appearance, and now, seeing before him a short, red-faced\r\nman with rather thin hair, with narrow plebeian hips, looking so\r\nuninteresting and so unintellectual, he asked himself: "Can I really\r\nlook like that?"\r\n\r\n"How glad I am to see you!" said Fyodor, kissing his brother and\r\npressing his hand warmly. "I have been impatiently looking forward\r\nto seeing you every day, my dear fellow. When you wrote that you\r\nwere getting married, I was tormented with curiosity, and I\'ve\r\nmissed you, too, brother. Only fancy, it\'s six months since we saw\r\neach other. Well? How goes it? Nina\'s very bad? Awfully bad?"\r\n\r\n"Awfully bad."\r\n\r\n"It\'s in God\'s hands," sighed Fyodor. "Well, what of your wife?\r\nShe\'s a beauty, no doubt? I love her already. Of course, she is my\r\nlittle sister now. We\'ll make much of her between us."\r\n\r\nLaptev saw the broad, bent back--so familiar to him--of his\r\nfather, Fyodor Stepanovitch. The old man was sitting on a stool\r\nnear the counter, talking to a customer.\r\n\r\n"Father, God has sent us joy!" cried Fyodor. "Brother has come!"\r\n\r\nFyodor Stepanovitch was a tall man of exceptionally powerful build,\r\nso that, in spite of his wrinkles and eighty years, he still looked\r\na hale and vigorous man. He spoke in a deep, rich, sonorous voice,\r\nthat resounded from his broad chest as from a barrel. He wore no\r\nbeard, but a short-clipped military moustache, and smoked cigars.\r\nAs he was always too hot, he used all the year round to wear a\r\ncanvas coat at home and at the warehouse. He had lately had an\r\noperation for cataract. His sight was bad, and he did nothing in\r\nthe business but talk to the customers and have tea and jam with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLaptev bent down and kissed his head and then his lips.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good long time since we saw you, honoured sir," said the\r\nold man--"a good long time. Well, am I to congratulate you on\r\nentering the state of holy matrimony? Very well, then; I congratulate\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nAnd he put his lips out to be kissed. Laptev bent down and kissed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you brought your young lady?" the old man asked, and\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, he said, addressing the customer:\r\n"\'Herewith I beg to inform you, father, that I\'m going to marry such\r\nand such a young lady.\' Yes. But as for asking for his father\'s\r\ncounsel or blessing, that\'s not in the rules nowadays. Now they go\r\ntheir own way. When I married I was over forty, but I went on my\r\nknees to my father and asked his advice. Nowadays we\'ve none of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nThe old man was delighted to see his son, but thought it unseemly\r\nto show his affection or make any display of his joy. His voice and\r\nhis manner of saying "your young lady" brought back to Laptev the\r\ndepression he had always felt in the warehouse. Here every trifling\r\ndetail reminded him of the past, when he used to be flogged and put\r\non Lenten fare; he knew that even now boys were thrashed and punched\r\nin the face till their noses bled, and that when those boys grew\r\nup they would beat others. And before he had been five minutes in\r\nthe warehouse, he always felt as though he were being scolded or\r\npunched in the face.\r\n\r\nFyodor slapped the customer on the shoulder and said to his brother:\r\n\r\n"Here, Alyosha, I must introduce our Tambov benefactor, Grigory\r\nTimofeitch. He might serve as an example for the young men of the\r\nday; he\'s passed his fiftieth birthday, and he has tiny children."\r\n\r\nThe clerks laughed, and the customer, a lean old man with a pale\r\nface, laughed too.\r\n\r\n"Nature above the normal capacity," observed the head-clerk, who\r\nwas standing at the counter close by. "It always comes out when\r\nit\'s there."\r\n\r\nThe head-clerk--a tall man of fifty, in spectacles, with a dark\r\nbeard, and a pencil behind his ear--usually expressed his ideas\r\nvaguely in roundabout hints, while his sly smile betrayed that he\r\nattached particular significance to his words. He liked to obscure\r\nhis utterances with bookish words, which he understood in his own\r\nway, and many such words he used in a wrong sense. For instance,\r\nthe word "except." When he had expressed some opinion positively\r\nand did not want to be contradicted, he would stretch out his hand\r\nand pronounce:\r\n\r\n"Except!"\r\n\r\nAnd what was most astonishing, the customers and the other clerks\r\nunderstood him perfectly. His name was Ivan Vassilitch Potchatkin,\r\nand he came from Kashira. Now, congratulating Laptev, he expressed\r\nhimself as follows:\r\n\r\n"It\'s the reward of valour, for the female heart is a strong\r\nopponent."\r\n\r\nAnother important person in the warehouse was a clerk called\r\nMakeitchev--a stout, solid, fair man with whiskers and a perfectly\r\nbald head. He went up to Laptev and congratulated him respectfully\r\nin a low voice:\r\n\r\n"I have the honour, sir. . . The Lord has heard your parent\'s prayer.\r\nThank God."\r\n\r\nThen the other clerks began coming up to congratulate him on his\r\nmarriage. They were all fashionably dressed, and looked like perfectly\r\nwell-bred, educated men. Since between every two words they put in\r\na "sir," their congratulations--something like "Best wishes, sir,\r\nfor happiness, sir," uttered very rapidly in a low voice--sounded\r\nrather like the hiss of a whip in the air--"Shshsh-s s s s s!"\r\nLaptev was soon bored and longing to go home, but it was awkward\r\nto go away. He was obliged to stay at least two hours at the warehouse\r\nto keep up appearances. He walked away from the counter and began\r\nasking Makeitchev whether things had gone well while he was away,\r\nand whether anything new had turned up, and the clerk answered him\r\nrespectfully, avoiding his eyes. A boy with a cropped head, wearing\r\na grey blouse, handed Laptev a glass of tea without a saucer; not\r\nlong afterwards another boy, passing by, stumbled over a box, and\r\nalmost fell down, and Makeitchev\'s face looked suddenly spiteful\r\nand ferocious like a wild beast\'s, and he shouted at him:\r\n\r\n"Keep on your feet!"\r\n\r\nThe clerks were pleased that their young master was married and had\r\ncome back at last; they looked at him with curiosity and friendly\r\nfeeling, and each one thought it his duty to say something agreeable\r\nwhen he passed him. But Laptev was convinced that it was not genuine,\r\nand that they were only flattering him because they were afraid of\r\nhim. He never could forget how fifteen years before, a clerk, who\r\nwas mentally deranged, had run out into the street with nothing on\r\nbut his shirt and shaking his fists at the windows, shouted that\r\nhe had been ill-treated; and how, when the poor fellow had recovered,\r\nthe clerks had jeered at him for long afterwards, reminding him how\r\nhe had called his employers "planters" instead of "exploiters."\r\nAltogether the employees at Laptevs\' had a very poor time of it,\r\nand this fact was a subject of conversation for the whole market.\r\nThe worst of it was that the old man, Fyodor Stepanovitch, maintained\r\nsomething of an Asiatic despotism in his attitude to them. Thus,\r\nno one knew what wages were paid to the old man\'s favourites,\r\nPotchatkin and Makeitchev. They received no more than three thousand\r\na year, together with bonuses, but he made out that he paid then\r\nseven. The bonuses were given to all the clerks every year, but\r\nprivately, so that the man who got little was bound from vanity to\r\nsay he had got more. Not one boy knew when he would be promoted to\r\nbe a clerk; not one of the men knew whether his employer was satisfied\r\nwith him or not. Nothing was directly forbidden, and so the clerks\r\nnever knew what was allowed, and what was not. They were not forbidden\r\nto marry, but they did not marry for fear of displeasing their\r\nemployer and losing their place. They were allowed to have friends\r\nand pay visits, but the gates were shut at nine o\'clock, and every\r\nmorning the old man scanned them all suspiciously, and tried to\r\ndetect any smell of vodka about them:\r\n\r\n"Now then, breathe," he would say.\r\n\r\nEvery clerk was obliged to go to early service, and to stand in\r\nchurch in such a position that the old man could see them all. The\r\nfasts were strictly observed. On great occasions, such as the\r\nbirthday of their employer or of any member of his family, the\r\nclerks had to subscribe and present a cake from Fley\'s, or an album.\r\nThe clerks lived three or four in a room in the lower storey, and\r\nin the lodges of the house in Pyatnitsky Street, and at dinner ate\r\nfrom a common bowl, though there was a plate set before each of\r\nthem. If one of the family came into the room while they were at\r\ndinner, they all stood up.\r\n\r\nLaptev was conscious that only, perhaps, those among them who had\r\nbeen corrupted by the old man\'s training could seriously regard him\r\nas their benefactor; the others must have looked on him as an enemy\r\nand a "planter." Now, after six months\' absence, he saw no change\r\nfor the better; there was indeed something new which boded nothing\r\ngood. His brother Fyodor, who had always been quiet, thoughtful,\r\nand extremely refined, was now running about the warehouse with a\r\npencil behind his ear making a show of being very busy and businesslike,\r\nslapping customers on the shoulder and shouting "Friends!" to the\r\nclerks. Apparently he had taken up a new role, and Alexey did not\r\nrecognise him in the part.\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s voice boomed unceasingly. Having nothing to do, he\r\nwas laying down the law to a customer, telling him how he should\r\norder his life and his business, always holding himself up as an\r\nexample. That boastfulness, that aggressive tone of authority,\r\nLaptev had heard ten, fifteen, twenty years ago. The old man adored\r\nhimself; from what he said it always appeared that he had made his\r\nwife and all her relations happy, that he had been munificent to\r\nhis children, and a benefactor to his clerks and employ\xe9s, and that\r\nevery one in the street and all his acquaintances remembered him\r\nin their prayers. Whatever he did was always right, and if things\r\nwent wrong with people it was because they did not take his advice;\r\nwithout his advice nothing could succeed. In church he stood in the\r\nforemost place, and even made observations to the priests, if in\r\nhis opinion they were not conducting the service properly, and\r\nbelieved that this was pleasing God because God loved him.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock every one in the warehouse was hard at work, except\r\nthe old man, who still went on booming in his deep voice. To avoid\r\nstanding idle, Laptev took some trimmings from a workgirl and let\r\nher go; then listened to a customer, a merchant from Vologda, and\r\ntold a clerk to attend to him.\r\n\r\n"T. V. A.!" resounded on all sides (prices were denoted by letters\r\nin the warehouse and goods by numbers). "R. I. T.!" As he went away,\r\nLaptev said good-bye to no one but Fyodor.\r\n\r\n"I shall come to Pyatnitsky Street with my wife to-morrow," he said;\r\n"but I warn you, if father says a single rude thing to her, I shall\r\nnot stay there another minute."\r\n\r\n"You\'re the same as ever," sighed Fyodor. "Marriage has not changed\r\nyou. You must be patient with the old man. So till eleven o\'clock,\r\nthen. We shall expect you impatiently. Come directly after mass,\r\nthen."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t go to mass."\r\n\r\n"That does not matter. The great thing is not to be later than\r\neleven, so you may be in time to pray to God and to lunch with us.\r\nGive my greetings to my little sister and kiss her hand for me. I\r\nhave a presentiment that I shall like her," Fyodor added with perfect\r\nsincerity. "I envy you, brother!" he shouted after him as Alexey\r\nwent downstairs.\r\n\r\n"And why does he shrink into himself in that shy way as though he\r\nfancied he was naked?" thought Laptev, as he walked along Nikolsky\r\nStreet, trying to understand the change that had come over his\r\nbrother. "And his language is new, too: \'Brother, dear brother, God\r\nhas sent us joy; to pray to God\'--just like Iudushka in Shtchedrin."\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\'clock the next day, which was Sunday, he was driving\r\nwith his wife along Pyatnitsky Street in a light, one-horse carriage.\r\nHe was afraid of his father\'s doing something outrageous, and was\r\nalready ill at ease. After two nights in her husband\'s house Yulia\r\nSergeyevna considered her marriage a mistake and a calamity, and\r\nif she had had to live with her husband in any other town but Moscow,\r\nit seemed to her that she could not have endured the horror of it.\r\nMoscow entertained her--she was delighted with the streets, the\r\nchurches; and if it had been possible to drive about Moscow in those\r\nsplendid sledges with expensive horses, to drive the whole day from\r\nmorning till night, and with the swift motion to feel the cold\r\nautumn air blowing upon her, she would perhaps not have felt herself\r\nso unhappy.\r\n\r\nNear a white, lately stuccoed two-storey house the coachman pulled\r\nup his horse, and began to turn to the right. They were expected,\r\nand near the gate stood two policemen and the porter in a new\r\nfull-skirted coat, high boots, and goloshes. The whole space, from\r\nthe middle of the street to the gates and all over the yard from\r\nthe porch, was strewn with fresh sand. The porter took off his hat,\r\nthe policemen saluted. Near the entrance Fyodor met them with a\r\nvery serious face.\r\n\r\n"Very glad to make your acquaintance, little sister," he said,\r\nkissing Yulia\'s hand. "You\'re very welcome."\r\n\r\nHe led her upstairs on his arm, and then along a corridor through\r\na crowd of men and women. The anteroom was crowded too, and smelt\r\nof incense.\r\n\r\n"I will introduce you to our father directly," whispered Fyodor in\r\nthe midst of a solemn, deathly silence. "A venerable old man,\r\n_pater-familias_."\r\n\r\nIn the big drawing-room, by a table prepared for service, Fyodor\r\nStepanovitch stood, evidently waiting for them, and with him the\r\npriest in a calotte, and a deacon. The old man shook hands with\r\nYulia without saying a word. Every one was silent. Yulia was overcome\r\nwith confusion.\r\n\r\nThe priest and the deacon began putting on their vestments. A censer\r\nwas brought in, giving off sparks and fumes of incense and charcoal.\r\nThe candles were lighted. The clerks walked into the drawing-room\r\non tiptoe and stood in two rows along the wall. There was perfect\r\nstillness, no one even coughed.\r\n\r\n"The blessing of God," began the deacon. The service was read with\r\ngreat solemnity; nothing was left out and two canticles were sung\r\n--to sweetest Jesus and the most Holy Mother of God. The singers\r\nsang very slowly, holding up the music before them. Laptev noticed\r\nhow confused his wife was. While they were singing the canticles,\r\nand the singers in different keys brought out "Lord have mercy on\r\nus," he kept expecting in nervous suspense that the old man would\r\nmake some remark such as, "You don\'t know how to cross yourself,"\r\nand he felt vexed. Why this crowd, and why this ceremony with priests\r\nand choristers? It was too bourgeois. But when she, like the old\r\nman, put her head under the gospel and afterwards several times\r\ndropped upon her knees, he realised that she liked it all, and was\r\nreassured.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the service, during "Many, many years," the priest\r\ngave the old man and Alexey the cross to kiss, but when Yulia went\r\nup, he put his hand over the cross, and showed he wanted to speak.\r\nSigns were made to the singers to stop.\r\n\r\n"The prophet Samuel," began the priest, "went to Bethlehem at the\r\nbidding of the Lord, and there the elders of the town with fear and\r\ntrembling asked him: \'Comest thou peaceably?\' And the prophet\r\nanswered: \'Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord: sanctify\r\nyourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.\' Even so, Yulia,\r\nservant of God, shall we ask of thee, Dost thou come bringing peace\r\ninto this house?"\r\n\r\nYulia flushed with emotion. As he finished, the priest gave her the\r\ncross to kiss, and said in quite a different tone of voice:\r\n\r\n"Now Fyodor Fyodorovitch must be married; it\'s high time."\r\n\r\nThe choir began singing once more, people began moving, and the\r\nroom was noisy again. The old man, much touched, with his eyes full\r\nof tears, kissed Yulia three times, made the sign of the cross over\r\nher face, and said:\r\n\r\n"This is your home. I\'m an old man and need nothing."\r\n\r\nThe clerks congratulated her and said something, but the choir was\r\nsinging so loud that nothing else could be heard. Then they had\r\nlunch and drank champagne. She sat beside the old father, and he\r\ntalked to her, saying that families ought not to be parted but live\r\ntogether in one house; that separation and disunion led to permanent\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve made money and the children only do the spending of it," he\r\nsaid. "Now, you live with me and save money. It\'s time for an old\r\nman like me to rest."\r\n\r\nYulia had all the time a vision of Fyodor flitting about so like\r\nher husband, but shyer and more restless; he fussed about her and\r\noften kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n"We are plain people, little sister," he said, and patches of red\r\ncame into his face as he spoke. "We live simply in Russian style,\r\nlike Christians, little sister."\r\n\r\nAs they went home, Laptev felt greatly relieved that everything had\r\ngone off so well, and that nothing outrageous had happened as he\r\nhad expected. He said to his wife:\r\n\r\n"You\'re surprised that such a stalwart, broad-shouldered father\r\nshould have such stunted, narrow-chested sons as Fyodor and me.\r\nYes; but it\'s easy to explain! My father married my mother when he\r\nwas forty-five, and she was only seventeen. She turned pale and\r\ntrembled in his presence. Nina was born first--born of a comparatively\r\nhealthy mother, and so she was finer and sturdier than we were.\r\nFyodor and I were begotten and born after mother had been worn out\r\nby terror. I can remember my father correcting me--or, to speak\r\nplainly, beating me--before I was five years old. He used to\r\nthrash me with a birch, pull my ears, hit me on the head, and every\r\nmorning when I woke up my first thought was whether he would beat\r\nme that day. Play and childish mischief was forbidden us. We had\r\nto go to morning service and to early mass. When we met priests or\r\nmonks we had to kiss their hands; at home we had to sing hymns.\r\nHere you are religious and love all that, but I\'m afraid of religion,\r\nand when I pass a church I remember my childhood, and am overcome\r\nwith horror. I was taken to the warehouse as soon as I was eight\r\nyears old. I worked like a working boy, and it was bad for my health,\r\nfor I used to be beaten there every day. Afterwards when I went to\r\nthe high school, I used to go to school till dinner-time, and after\r\ndinner I had to sit in that warehouse till evening; and things went\r\non like that till I was twenty-two, till I got to know Yartsev, and\r\nhe persuaded me to leave my father\'s house. That Yartsev did a great\r\ndeal for me. I tell you what," said Laptev, and he laughed with\r\npleasure: "let us go and pay Yartsev a visit at once. He\'s a very\r\nfine fellow! How touched he will be!"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nOn a Saturday in November Anton Rubinstein was conducting in a\r\nsymphony concert. It was very hot and crowded. Laptev stood behind\r\nthe columns, while his wife and Kostya Kotchevoy were sitting in\r\nthe third or fourth row some distance in front. At the very beginning\r\nof an interval a "certain person," Polina Nikolaevna Razsudin, quite\r\nunexpectedly passed by him. He had often since his marriage thought\r\nwith trepidation of a possible meeting with her. When now she looked\r\nat him openly and directly, he realised that he had all this time\r\nshirked having things out with her, or writing her two or three\r\nfriendly lines, as though he had been hiding from her; he felt\r\nashamed and flushed crimson. She pressed his hand tightly and\r\nimpulsively and asked:\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Yartsev?"\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for an answer she went striding on impetuously\r\nas though some one were pushing her on from behind.\r\n\r\nShe was very thin and plain, with a long nose; her face always\r\nlooked tired, and exhausted, and it seemed as though it were an\r\neffort to her to keep her eyes open, and not to fall down. She had\r\nfine, dark eyes, and an intelligent, kind, sincere expression, but\r\nher movements were awkward and abrupt. It was hard to talk to her,\r\nbecause she could not talk or listen quietly. Loving her was not\r\neasy. Sometimes when she was alone with Laptev she would go on\r\nlaughing for a long time, hiding her face in her hands, and would\r\ndeclare that love was not the chief thing in life for her, and would\r\nbe as whimsical as a girl of seventeen; and before kissing her he\r\nwould have to put out all the candles. She was thirty. She was\r\nmarried to a schoolmaster, but had not lived with her husband for\r\nyears. She earned her living by giving music lessons and playing\r\nin quartettes.\r\n\r\nDuring the ninth symphony she passed again as though by accident,\r\nbut the crowd of men standing like a thick wall behind the columns\r\nprevented her going further, and she remained beside him. Laptev\r\nsaw that she was wearing the same little velvet blouse she had worn\r\nat concerts last year and the year before. Her gloves were new, and\r\nher fan, too, was new, but it was a common one. She was fond of\r\nfine clothes, but she did not know how to dress, and grudged spending\r\nmoney on it. She dressed so badly and untidily that when she was\r\ngoing to her lessons striding hurriedly down the street, she might\r\neasily have been taken for a young monk.\r\n\r\nThe public applauded and shouted encore.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll spend the evening with me," said Polina Nikolaevna, going\r\nup to Laptev and looking at him severely. "When this is over we\'ll\r\ngo and have tea. Do you hear? I insist on it. You owe me a great\r\ndeal, and haven\'t the moral right to refuse me such a trifle."\r\n\r\n"Very well; let us go," Laptev assented.\r\n\r\nEndless calls followed the conclusion of the concert. The audience\r\ngot up from their seats and went out very slowly, and Laptev could\r\nnot go away without telling his wife. He had to stand at the door\r\nand wait.\r\n\r\n"I\'m dying for some tea," Polina Nikolaevna said plaintively. "My\r\nvery soul is parched."\r\n\r\n"You can get something to drink here," said Laptev. "Let\'s go to\r\nthe buffet."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve no money to fling away on waiters. I\'m not a shopkeeper."\r\n\r\nHe offered her his arm; she refused, in a long, wearisome sentence\r\nwhich he had heard many times, to the effect that she did not class\r\nherself with the feebler fair sex, and did not depend on the services\r\nof gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAs she talked to him she kept looking about at the audience and\r\ngreeting acquaintances; they were her fellow-students at the higher\r\ncourses and at the conservatorium, and her pupils. She gripped their\r\nhands abruptly, as though she were tugging at them. But then she\r\nbegan twitching her shoulders, and trembling as though she were in\r\na fever, and at last said softly, looking at Laptev with horror:\r\n\r\n"Who is it you\'ve married? Where were your eyes, you mad fellow?\r\nWhat did you see in that stupid, insignificant girl? Why, I loved\r\nyou for your mind, for your soul, but that china doll wants nothing\r\nbut your money!"\r\n\r\n"Let us drop that, Polina," he said in a voice of supplication.\r\n"All that you can say to me about my marriage I\'ve said to myself\r\nmany times already. Don\'t cause me unnecessary pain."\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna made her appearance, wearing a black dress with a\r\nbig diamond brooch, which her father-in-law had sent her after the\r\nservice. She was followed by her suite--Kotchevoy, two doctors\r\nof their acquaintance, an officer, and a stout young man in student\'s\r\nuniform, called Kish.\r\n\r\n"You go on with Kostya," Laptev said to his wife. "I\'m coming later."\r\n\r\nYulia nodded and went on. Polina Nikolaevna gazed after her, quivering\r\nall over and twitching nervously, and in her eyes there was a look\r\nof repulsion, hatred, and pain.\r\n\r\nLaptev was afraid to go home with her, foreseeing an unpleasant\r\ndiscussion, cutting words, and tears, and he suggested that they\r\nshould go and have tea at a restaurant. But she said:\r\n\r\n"No, no. I want to go home. Don\'t dare to talk to me of restaurants."\r\n\r\nShe did not like being in a restaurant, because the atmosphere of\r\nrestaurants seemed to her poisoned by tobacco smoke and the breath\r\nof men. Against all men she did not know she cherished a strange\r\nprejudice, regarding them all as immoral rakes, capable of attacking\r\nher at any moment. Besides, the music played at restaurants jarred\r\non her nerves and gave her a headache.\r\n\r\nComing out of the Hall of Nobility, they took a sledge in Ostozhenka\r\nand drove to Savelovsky Lane, where she lodged. All the way Laptev\r\nthought about her. It was true that he owed her a great deal. He\r\nhad made her acquaintance at the flat of his friend Yartsev, to\r\nwhom she was giving lessons in harmony. Her love for him was deep\r\nand perfectly disinterested, and her relations with him did not\r\nalter her habits; she went on giving her lessons and wearing herself\r\nout with work as before. Through her he came to understand and love\r\nmusic, which he had scarcely cared for till then.\r\n\r\n"Half my kingdom for a cup of tea!" she pronounced in a hollow\r\nvoice, covering her mouth with her muff that she might not catch\r\ncold. "I\'ve given five lessons, confound them! My pupils are as\r\nstupid as posts; I nearly died of exasperation. I don\'t know how\r\nlong this slavery can go on. I\'m worn out. As soon as I can scrape\r\ntogether three hundred roubles, I shall throw it all up and go to\r\nthe Crimea, to lie on the beach and drink in ozone. How I love the\r\nsea--oh, how I love the sea!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never go," said Laptev. "To begin with, you\'ll never save\r\nthe money; and, besides, you\'d grudge spending it. Forgive me, I\r\nrepeat again: surely it\'s quite as humiliating to collect the money\r\nby farthings from idle people who have music lessons to while away\r\ntheir time, as to borrow it from your friends."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t any friends," she said irritably. "And please don\'t talk\r\nnonsense. The working class to which I belong has one privilege:\r\nthe consciousness of being incorruptible--the right to refuse to\r\nbe indebted to wretched little shopkeepers, and to treat them with\r\nscorn. No, indeed, you don\'t buy me! I\'m not a Yulitchka!"\r\n\r\nLaptev did not attempt to pay the driver, knowing that it would\r\ncall forth a perfect torrent of words, such as he had often heard\r\nbefore. She paid herself.\r\n\r\nShe had a little furnished room in the flat of a solitary lady who\r\nprovided her meals. Her big Becker piano was for the time at Yartsev\'s\r\nin Great Nikitsky Street, and she went there every day to play on\r\nit. In her room there were armchairs in loose covers, a bed with a\r\nwhite summer quilt, and flowers belonging to the landlady; there\r\nwere oleographs on the walls, and there was nothing that would have\r\nsuggested that there was a woman, and a woman of university education,\r\nliving in it. There was no toilet table; there were no books; there\r\nwas not even a writing-table. It was evident that she went to bed\r\nas soon as she got home, and went out as soon as she got up in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe cook brought in the samovar. Polina Nikolaevna made tea, and,\r\nstill shivering--the room was cold--began abusing the singers\r\nwho had sung in the ninth symphony. She was so tired she could\r\nhardly keep her eyes open. She drank one glass of tea, then a second,\r\nand then a third.\r\n\r\n"And so you are married," she said. "But don\'t be uneasy; I\'m not\r\ngoing to pine away. I shall be able to tear you out of my heart.\r\nOnly it\'s annoying and bitter to me that you are just as contemptible\r\nas every one else; that what you want in a woman is not brains or\r\nintellect, but simply a body, good looks, and youth. . . . Youth!"\r\nshe pronounced through her nose, as though mimicking some one, and\r\nshe laughed. "Youth! You must have purity, _reinheit! reinheit!_"\r\nshe laughed, throwing herself back in her chair. "_Reinheit!_"\r\n\r\nWhen she left off laughing her eyes were wet with tears.\r\n\r\n"You\'re happy, at any rate?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Does she love you?"\r\n\r\nLaptev, agitated, and feeling miserable, stood up and began walking\r\nabout the room.\r\n\r\n"No," he repeated. "If you want to know, Polina, I\'m very unhappy.\r\nThere\'s no help for it; I\'ve done the stupid thing, and there\'s no\r\ncorrecting it now. I must look at it philosophically. She married\r\nme without love, stupidly, perhaps with mercenary motives, but\r\nwithout understanding, and now she evidently sees her mistake and\r\nis miserable. I see it. At night we sleep together, but by day she\r\nis afraid to be left alone with me for five minutes, and tries to\r\nfind distraction, society. With me she feels ashamed and frightened."\r\n\r\n"And yet she takes money from you?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s stupid, Polina!" cried Laptev. "She takes money from me\r\nbecause it makes absolutely no difference to her whether she has\r\nit or not. She is an honest, pure girl. She married me simply because\r\nshe wanted to get away from her father, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"And are you sure she would have married you if you had not been\r\nrich?" asked Polina.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure of anything," said Laptev dejectedly. "Not of anything.\r\nI don\'t understand anything. For God\'s sake, Polina, don\'t let us\r\ntalk about it."\r\n\r\n"Do you love her?"\r\n\r\n"Desperately."\r\n\r\nA silence followed. She drank a fourth glass, while he paced up and\r\ndown, thinking that by now his wife was probably having supper at\r\nthe doctors\' club.\r\n\r\n"But is it possible to love without knowing why?" asked Polina,\r\nshrugging her shoulders. "No; it\'s the promptings of animal passion!\r\nYou are poisoned, intoxicated by that beautiful body, that _reinheit!_\r\nGo away from me; you are unclean! Go to her!"\r\n\r\nShe brandished her hand at him, then took up his hat and hurled it\r\nat him. He put on his fur coat without speaking and went out, but\r\nshe ran after him into the passage, clutched his arm above the\r\nelbow, and broke into sobs.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Polina! Don\'t!" he said, and could not unclasp her fingers.\r\n"Calm yourself, I entreat you."\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes and turned pale, and her long nose became an\r\nunpleasant waxy colour like a corpse\'s, and Laptev still could not\r\nunclasp her fingers. She had fainted. He lifted her up carefully,\r\nlaid her on her bed, and sat by her for ten minutes till she came\r\nto herself. Her hands were cold, her pulse was weak and uneven.\r\n\r\n"Go home," she said, opening her eyes. "Go away, or I shall begin\r\nhowling again. I must take myself in hand."\r\n\r\nWhen he came out, instead of going to the doctors\' club where his\r\nfriends were expecting him, he went home. All the way home he was\r\nasking himself reproachfully why he had not settled down to married\r\nlife with that woman who loved him so much, and was in reality his\r\nwife and friend. She was the one human being who was devoted to\r\nhim; and, besides, would it not have been a grateful and worthy\r\ntask to give happiness, peace, and a home to that proud, clever,\r\noverworked creature? Was it for him, he asked himself, to lay claim\r\nto youth and beauty, to that happiness which could not be, and\r\nwhich, as though in punishment or mockery, had kept him for the\r\nlast three months in a state of gloom and oppression. The honeymoon\r\nwas long over, and he still, absurd to say, did not know what sort\r\nof person his wife was. To her school friends and her father she\r\nwrote long letters of five sheets, and was never at a loss for\r\nsomething to say to them, but to him she never spoke except about\r\nthe weather or to tell him that dinner was ready, or that it was\r\nsupper-time. When at night she said her lengthy prayers and then\r\nkissed her crosses and ikons, he thought, watching her with hatred,\r\n"Here she\'s praying. What\'s she praying about? What about?" In his\r\nthoughts he showered insults on himself and her, telling himself\r\nthat when he got into bed and took her into his arms, he was taking\r\nwhat he had paid for; but it was horrible. If only it had been a\r\nhealthy, reckless, sinful woman; but here he had youth, piety,\r\nmeekness, the pure eyes of innocence. . . . While they were engaged\r\nher piety had touched him; now the conventional definiteness of her\r\nviews and convictions seemed to him a barrier, behind which the\r\nreal truth could not be seen. Already everything in his married\r\nlife was agonising. When his wife, sitting beside him in the theatre,\r\nsighed or laughed spontaneously, it was bitter to him that she\r\nenjoyed herself alone and would not share her delight with him. And\r\nit was remarkable that she was friendly with all his friends, and\r\nthey all knew what she was like already, while he knew nothing about\r\nher, and only moped and was dumbly jealous.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home Laptev put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and\r\nsat down in his study to read a novel. His wife was not at home.\r\nBut within half an hour there was a ring at the hall door, and he\r\nheard the muffled footsteps of Pyotr running to open it. It was\r\nYulia. She walked into the study in her fur coat, her cheeks rosy\r\nwith the frost,\r\n\r\n"There\'s a great fire in Pryesnya," she said breathlessly. "There\'s\r\na tremendous glow. I\'m going to see it with Konstantin Ivanovitch."\r\n\r\n"Well, do, dear!"\r\n\r\nThe sight of her health, her freshness, and the childish horror in\r\nher eyes, reassured Laptev. He read for another half-hour and went\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nNext day Polina Nikolaevna sent to the warehouse two books she had\r\nborrowed from him, all his letters and his photographs; with them\r\nwas a note consisting of one word--_"basta."_\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October Nina Fyodorovna had unmistakable symptoms\r\nof a relapse. There was a change in her face, and she grew rapidly\r\nthinner. In spite of acute pain she still imagined that she was\r\ngetting better, and got up and dressed every morning as though she\r\nwere well, and then lay on her bed, fully dressed, for the rest of\r\nthe day. And towards the end she became very talkative. She would\r\nlie on her back and talk in a low voice, speaking with an effort\r\nand breathing painfully. She died suddenly under the following\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear moonlight evening. In the street people were tobogganing\r\nin the fresh snow, and their clamour floated in at the window. Nina\r\nFyodorovna was lying on her back in bed, and Sasha, who had no one\r\nto take turns with her now, was sitting beside her half asleep.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember his father\'s name," Nina Fyodorovna was saying\r\nsoftly, "but his name was Ivan Kotchevoy--a poor clerk. He was a\r\nsad drunkard, the Kingdom of Heaven be his! He used to come to us,\r\nand every month we used to give him a pound of sugar and two ounces\r\nof tea. And money, too, sometimes, of course. Yes. . . . And then,\r\nthis is what happened. Our Kotchevoy began drinking heavily and\r\ndied, consumed by vodka. He left a little son, a boy of seven. Poor\r\nlittle orphan! . . . We took him and hid him in the clerk\'s quarters,\r\nand he lived there for a whole year, without father\'s knowing. And\r\nwhen father did see him, he only waved his hand and said nothing.\r\nWhen Kostya, the little orphan, was nine years old--by that time\r\nI was engaged to be married--I took him round to all the day\r\nschools. I went from one to the other, and no one would take him.\r\nAnd he cried. . . . \'What are you crying for, little silly?\' I said.\r\nI took him to Razgulyay to the second school, where--God bless\r\nthem for it!--they took him, and the boy began going every day\r\non foot from Pyatnitsky Street to Razgulyay Street and back again\r\n. . . . Alyosha paid for him. . . . By God\'s grace the boy got on,\r\nwas good at his lessons, and turned out well. . . . He\'s a lawyer\r\nnow in Moscow, a friend of Alyosha\'s, and so good in science. Yes,\r\nwe had compassion on a fellow-creature and took him into our house,\r\nand now I daresay, he remembers us in his prayers. . . Yes. . . ."\r\n\r\nNina Fyodorovna spoke more and more slowly with long pauses, then\r\nafter a brief silence she suddenly raised herself and sat up.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something the matter with me . . . something seems wrong,"\r\nshe said. "Lord have mercy on me! Oh, I can\'t breathe!"\r\n\r\nSasha knew that her mother would soon die; seeing now how suddenly\r\nher face looked drawn, she guessed that it was the end, and she was\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n"Mother, you mustn\'t!" she began sobbing. "You mustn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Run to the kitchen; let them go for father. I am very ill indeed."\r\n\r\nSasha ran through all the rooms calling, but there were none of the\r\nservants in the house, and the only person she found was Lida asleep\r\non a chest in the dining-room with her clothes on and without a\r\npillow. Sasha ran into the yard just as she was without her goloshes,\r\nand then into the street. On a bench at the gate her nurse was\r\nsitting watching the tobogganing. From beyond the river, where the\r\ntobogganing slope was, came the strains of a military band.\r\n\r\n"Nurse, mother\'s dying!" sobbed Sasha. "You must go for father! . . ."\r\n\r\nThe nurse went upstairs, and, glancing at the sick woman, thrust a\r\nlighted wax candle into her hand. Sasha rushed about in terror and\r\nbesought some one to go for her father, then she put on a coat and\r\na kerchief, and ran into the street. From the servants she knew\r\nalready that her father had another wife and two children with whom\r\nhe lived in Bazarny Street. She ran out of the gate and turned to\r\nthe left, crying, and frightened of unknown people. She soon began\r\nto sink into the snow and grew numb with cold.\r\n\r\nShe met an empty sledge, but she did not take it: perhaps, she\r\nthought, the man would drive her out of town, rob her, and throw\r\nher into the cemetery (the servants had talked of such a case at\r\ntea). She went on and on, sobbing and panting with exhaustion. When\r\nshe got into Bazarny Street, she inquired where M. Panaurov lived.\r\nAn unknown woman spent a long time directing her, and seeing that\r\nshe did not understand, took her by the hand and led her to a house\r\nof one storey that stood back from the street. The door stood open.\r\nSasha ran through the entry, along the corridor, and found herself\r\nat last in a warm, lighted room where her father was sitting by the\r\nsamovar with a lady and two children. But by now she was unable to\r\nutter a word, and could only sob. Panaurov understood.\r\n\r\n"Mother\'s worse?" he asked. "Tell me, child: is mother worse?"\r\n\r\nHe was alarmed and sent for a sledge.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, Nina Fyodorovna was sitting propped up with\r\npillows, with a candle in her hand. Her face looked dark and her\r\neyes were closed. Crowding in the doorway stood the nurse, the cook,\r\nthe housemaid, a peasant called Prokofy and a few persons of the\r\nhumbler class, who were complete strangers. The nurse was giving\r\nthem orders in a whisper, and they did not understand. Inside the\r\nroom at the window stood Lida, with a pale and sleepy face, gazing\r\nseverely at her mother.\r\n\r\nPanaurov took the candle out of Nina Fyodorovna\'s hand, and, frowning\r\ncontemptuously, flung it on the chest of drawers.\r\n\r\n"This is awful!" he said, and his shoulders quivered. "Nina, you\r\nmust lie down," he said affectionately. "Lie down, dear."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, but did not know him. They laid her down on her\r\nback.\r\n\r\nWhen the priest and the doctor, Sergey Borisovitch, arrived, the\r\nservants crossed themselves devoutly and prayed for her.\r\n\r\n"What a sad business!" said the doctor thoughtfully, coming out\r\ninto the drawing-room. "Why, she was still young--not yet forty."\r\n\r\nThey heard the loud sobbing of the little girls. Panaurov, with a\r\npale face and moist eyes, went up to the doctor and said in a faint,\r\nweak voice:\r\n\r\n"Do me a favour, my dear fellow. Send a telegram to Moscow. I\'m not\r\nequal to it."\r\n\r\nThe doctor fetched the ink and wrote the following telegram to his\r\ndaughter:\r\n\r\n"Madame Panaurov died at eight o\'clock this evening. Tell your\r\nhusband: a mortgaged house for sale in Dvoryansky Street, nine\r\nthousand cash. Auction on twelfth. Advise him not miss opportunity."\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nLaptev lived in one of the turnings out of Little Dmitrovka. Besides\r\nthe big house facing the street, he rented also a two-storey lodge\r\nin the yard at the back of his friend Kotchevoy, a lawyer\'s assistant\r\nwhom all the Laptevs called Kostya, because he had grown up under\r\ntheir eyes. Facing this lodge stood another, also of two storeys,\r\ninhabited by a French family consisting of a husband and wife and\r\nfive daughters.\r\n\r\nThere was a frost of twenty degrees. The windows were frozen over.\r\nWaking up in the morning, Kostya, with an anxious face, took twenty\r\ndrops of a medicine; then, taking two dumb-bells out of the bookcase,\r\nhe did gymnastic exercises. He was tall and thin, with big reddish\r\nmoustaches; but what was most noticeable in his appearance was the\r\nlength of his legs.\r\n\r\nPyotr, a middle-aged peasant in a reefer jacket and cotton breeches\r\ntucked into his high boots, brought in the samovar and made the\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very nice weather now, Konstantin Ivanovitch," he said.\r\n\r\n"It is, but I tell you what, brother, it\'s a pity we can\'t get on,\r\nyou and I, without such exclamations."\r\n\r\nPyotr sighed from politeness.\r\n\r\n"What are the little girls doing?" asked Kotchevoy.\r\n\r\n"The priest has not come. Alexey Fyodorovitch is giving them their\r\nlesson himself."\r\n\r\nKostya found a spot in the window that was not covered with frost,\r\nand began looking through a field-glass at the windows of the house\r\nwhere the French family lived.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no seeing," he said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Alexey Fyodorovitch was giving Sasha and Lida a scripture\r\nlesson below. For the last six weeks they had been living in Moscow,\r\nand were installed with their governess in the lower storey of the\r\nlodge. And three times a week a teacher from a school in the town,\r\nand a priest, came to give them lessons. Sasha was going through\r\nthe New Testament and Lida was going through the Old. The time\r\nbefore Lida had been set the story up to Abraham to learn by heart.\r\n\r\n"And so Adam and Eve had two sons," said Laptev. "Very good. But\r\nwhat were they called? Try to remember them!"\r\n\r\nLida, still with the same severe face, gazed dumbly at the table.\r\nShe moved her lips, but without speaking; and the elder girl, Sasha,\r\nlooked into her face, frowning.\r\n\r\n"You know it very well, only you mustn\'t be nervous," said Laptev.\r\n"Come, what were Adam\'s sons called?"\r\n\r\n"Abel and Canel," Lida whispered.\r\n\r\n"Cain and Abel," Laptev corrected her.\r\n\r\nA big tear rolled down Lida\'s cheek and dropped on the book. Sasha\r\nlooked down and turned red, and she, too, was on the point of tears.\r\nLaptev felt a lump in his throat, and was so sorry for them he could\r\nnot speak. He got up from the table and lighted a cigarette. At\r\nthat moment Kotchevoy came down the stairs with a paper in his hand.\r\nThe little girls stood up, and without looking at him, made curtsies.\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake, Kostya, give them their lessons," said Laptev,\r\nturning to him. "I\'m afraid I shall cry, too, and I have to go to\r\nthe warehouse before dinner."\r\n\r\n"All right."\r\n\r\nAlexey Fyodorovitch went away. Kostya, with a very serious face,\r\nsat down to the table and drew the Scripture history towards him.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said; "where have you got to?"\r\n\r\n"She knows about the Flood," said Sasha.\r\n\r\n"The Flood? All right. Let\'s peg in at the Flood. Fire away about\r\nthe Flood." Kostya skimmed through a brief description of the Flood\r\nin the book, and said: "I must remark that there really never was\r\na flood such as is described here. And there was no such person as\r\nNoah. Some thousands of years before the birth of Christ, there was\r\nan extraordinary inundation of the earth, and that\'s not only\r\nmentioned in the Jewish Bible, but in the books of other ancient\r\npeoples: the Greeks, the Chaldeans, the Hindoos. But whatever the\r\ninundation may have been, it couldn\'t have covered the whole earth.\r\nIt may have flooded the plains, but the mountains must have remained.\r\nYou can read this book, of course, but don\'t put too much faith in\r\nit."\r\n\r\nTears trickled down Lida\'s face again. She turned away and suddenly\r\nburst into such loud sobs, that Kostya started and jumped up from\r\nhis seat in great confusion.\r\n\r\n"I want to go home," she said, "to papa and to nurse."\r\n\r\nSasha cried too. Kostya went upstairs to his own room, and spoke\r\non the telephone to Yulia Sergeyevna.\r\n\r\n"My dear soul," he said, "the little girls are crying again; there\'s\r\nno doing anything with them."\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna ran across from the big house in her indoor dress,\r\nwith only a knitted shawl over her shoulders, and chilled through\r\nby the frost, began comforting the children.\r\n\r\n"Do believe me, do believe me," she said in an imploring voice,\r\nhugging first one and then the other. "Your papa\'s coming to-day;\r\nhe has sent a telegram. You\'re grieving for mother, and I grieve\r\ntoo. My heart\'s torn, but what can we do? We must bow to God\'s\r\nwill!"\r\n\r\nWhen they left off crying, she wrapped them up and took them out\r\nfor a drive. They stopped near the Iverskoy chapel, put up candles\r\nat the shrine, and, kneeling down, prayed. On the way back they\r\nwent in Filippov\'s, and had cakes sprinkled with poppy-seeds.\r\n\r\nThe Laptevs had dinner between two and three. Pyotr handed the\r\ndishes. This Pyotr waited on the family, and by day ran to the post,\r\nto the warehouse, to the law courts for Kostya; he spent his evenings\r\nmaking cigarettes, ran to open the door at night, and before five\r\no\'clock in the morning was up lighting the stoves, and no one knew\r\nwhere he slept. He was very fond of opening seltzer-water bottles\r\nand did it easily, without a bang and without spilling a drop.\r\n\r\n"With God\'s blessing," said Kostya, drinking off a glass of vodka\r\nbefore the soup.\r\n\r\nAt first Yulia Sergeyevna did not like Kostya; his bass voice, his\r\nphrases such as "Landed him one on the beak," "filth," "produce the\r\nsamovar," etc., his habit of clinking glasses and making sentimental\r\nspeeches, seemed to her trivial. But as she got to know him better,\r\nshe began to feel very much at home with him. He was open with her;\r\nhe liked talking to her in a low voice in the evening, and even\r\ngave her novels of his own composition to read, though these had\r\nbeen kept a secret even from such friends as Laptev and Yartsev.\r\nShe read these novels and praised them, so that she might not\r\ndisappoint him, and he was delighted because he hoped sooner or\r\nlater to become a distinguished author.\r\n\r\nIn his novels he described nothing but country-house life, though\r\nhe had only seen the country on rare occasions when visiting friends\r\nat a summer villa, and had only been in a real country-house once\r\nin his life, when he had been to Volokolamsk on law business. He\r\navoided any love interest as though he were ashamed of it; he put\r\nin frequent descriptions of nature, and in them was fond of using\r\nsuch expressions as, "the capricious lines of the mountains, the\r\nmiraculous forms of the clouds, the harmony of mysterious rhythms\r\n. . . ." His novels had never been published, and this he attributed\r\nto the censorship.\r\n\r\nHe liked the duties of a lawyer, but yet he considered that his\r\nmost important pursuit was not the law but these novels. He believed\r\nthat he had a subtle, \xe6sthetic temperament, and he always had\r\nleanings towards art. He neither sang nor played on any musical\r\ninstrument, and was absolutely without an ear for music, but he\r\nattended all the symphony and philharmonic concerts, got up concerts\r\nfor charitable objects, and made the acquaintance of singers. . . .\r\n\r\nThey used to talk at dinner.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a strange thing," said Laptev, "my Fyodor took my breath away\r\nagain! He said we must find out the date of the centenary of our\r\nfirm, so as to try and get raised to noble rank; and he said it\r\nquite seriously. What can be the matter with him? I confess I begin\r\nto feel worried about him."\r\n\r\nThey talked of Fyodor, and of its being the fashion nowadays to\r\nadopt some pose or other. Fyodor, for instance, tried to appear\r\nlike a plain merchant, though he had ceased to be one; and when the\r\nteacher came from the school, of which old Laptev was the patron,\r\nto ask Fyodor for his salary, the latter changed his voice and\r\ndeportment, and behaved with the teacher as though he were some one\r\nin authority.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done; after dinner they went into the study.\r\nThey talked about the decadents, about "The Maid of Orleans," and\r\nKostya delivered a regular monologue; he fancied that he was very\r\nsuccessful in imitating Ermolova. Then they sat down and played\r\nwhist. The little girls had not gone back to the lodge but were\r\nsitting together in one arm-chair, with pale and mournful faces,\r\nand were listening to every noise in the street, wondering whether\r\nit was their father coming. In the evening when it was dark and the\r\ncandles were lighted, they felt deeply dejected. The talk over the\r\nwhist, the footsteps of Pyotr, the crackling in the fireplace,\r\njarred on their nerves, and they did not like to look at the fire.\r\nIn the evenings they did not want to cry, but they felt strange,\r\nand there was a load on their hearts. They could not understand how\r\npeople could talk and laugh when their mother was dead.\r\n\r\n"What did you see through the field-glasses today?" Yulia Sergeyevna\r\nasked Kostya.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to-day, but yesterday I saw the old Frenchman having his\r\nbath."\r\n\r\nAt seven o\'clock Yulia and Kostya went to the Little Theatre. Laptev\r\nwas left with the little girls.\r\n\r\n"It\'s time your father was here," he said, looking at his watch.\r\n"The train must be late."\r\n\r\nThe children sat in their arm-chair dumb and huddling together like\r\nanimals when they are cold, while he walked about the room looking\r\nimpatiently at his watch. It was quiet in the house. But just before\r\nnine o\'clock some one rang at the bell. Pyotr went to open the door.\r\n\r\nHearing a familiar voice, the children shrieked, burst into sobs,\r\nand ran into the hall. Panaurov was wearing a sumptuous coat of\r\nantelope skin, and his head and moustaches were white with hoar\r\nfrost. "In a minute, in a minute," he muttered, while Sasha and\r\nLida, sobbing and laughing, kissed his cold hands, his hat, his\r\nantelope coat. With the languor of a handsome man spoilt by too\r\nmuch love, he fondled the children without haste, then went into\r\nthe study and said, rubbing his hands:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not come to stay long, my friends. I\'m going to Petersburg\r\nto-morrow. They\'ve promised to transfer me to another town."\r\n\r\nHe was staying at the Dresden Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nA friend who was often at the Laptevs\' was Ivan Gavrilitch Yartsev.\r\nHe was a strong, healthy man with black hair and a clever, pleasant\r\nface. He was considered to be handsome, but of late he had begun\r\nto grow stout, and that rather spoilt his face and figure; another\r\nthing that spoilt him was that he wore his hair cut so close that\r\nthe skin showed through.\r\n\r\nAt the University his tall figure and physical strength had won him\r\nthe nickname of "the pounder" among the students. He had taken his\r\ndegree with the Laptev brothers in the faculty of philology--then\r\nhe went in for science and now had the degree of _magister_ in\r\nchemistry. But he had never given a lecture or even been a demonstrator.\r\nHe taught physics and natural history in the modern school, and in\r\ntwo girls\' high schools. He was enthusiastic over his pupils,\r\nespecially the girls, and used to maintain that a remarkable\r\ngeneration was growing up. At home he spent his time studying\r\nsociology and Russian history, as well as chemistry, and he sometimes\r\npublished brief notes in the newspapers and magazines, signing them\r\n"Y." When he talked of some botanical or zoological subject, he\r\nspoke like an historian; when he was discussing some historical\r\nquestion, he approached it as a man of science.\r\n\r\nKish, nicknamed "the eternal student," was also like one of the\r\nfamily at the Laptevs\'. He had been for three years studying medicine.\r\nThen he took up mathematics, and spent two years over each year\'s\r\ncourse. His father, a provincial druggist, used to send him forty\r\nroubles a month, to which his mother, without his father\'s knowledge,\r\nadded another ten. And this sum was not only sufficient for his\r\nboard and lodging, but even for such luxuries as an overcoat lined\r\nwith Polish beaver, gloves, scent, and photographs (he often had\r\nphotographs taken of himself and used to distribute them among his\r\nfriends). He was neat and demure, slightly bald, with golden\r\nside-whiskers, and he had the air of a man nearly always ready to\r\noblige. He was always busy looking after other people\'s affairs.\r\nAt one time he would be rushing about with a subscription list; at\r\nanother time he would be freezing in the early morning at a ticket\r\noffice to buy tickets for ladies of his acquaintance, or at somebody\'s\r\nrequest would be ordering a wreath or a bouquet. People simply said\r\nof him: "Kish will go, Kish will do it, Kish will buy it." He was\r\nusually unsuccessful in carrying out his commissions. Reproaches\r\nwere showered upon him, people frequently forgot to pay him for the\r\nthings he bought, but he simply sighed in hard cases and never\r\nprotested. He was never particularly delighted nor disappointed;\r\nhis stories were always long and boring; and his jokes invariably\r\nprovoked laughter just because they were not funny. Thus, one day,\r\nfor instance, intending to make a joke, he said to Pyotr: "Pyotr,\r\nyou\'re not a sturgeon;" and this aroused a general laugh, and he,\r\ntoo, laughed for a long time, much pleased at having made such a\r\nsuccessful jest. Whenever one of the professors was buried, he\r\nwalked in front with the mutes.\r\n\r\nYartsev and Kish usually came in the evening to tea. If the Laptevs\r\nwere not going to the theatre or a concert, the evening tea lingered\r\non till supper. One evening in February the following conversation\r\ntook place:\r\n\r\n"A work of art is only significant and valuable when there are some\r\nserious social problems contained in its central idea," said Kostya,\r\nlooking wrathfully at Yartsev. "If there is in the work a protest\r\nagainst serfdom, or the author takes up arms against the vulgarity\r\nof aristocratic society, the work is significant and valuable. The\r\nnovels that are taken up with \'Ach!\' and \'Och!\' and \'she loved him,\r\nwhile he ceased to love her,\' I tell you, are worthless, and damn\r\nthem all, I say!"\r\n\r\n"I agree with you, Konstantin Ivanovitch," said Yulia Sergeyevna.\r\n"One describes a love scene; another, a betrayal; and the third,\r\nmeeting again after separation. Are there no other subjects? Why,\r\nthere are many people sick, unhappy, harassed by poverty, to whom\r\nreading all that must be distasteful."\r\n\r\nIt was disagreeable to Laptev to hear his wife, not yet twenty-two,\r\nspeaking so seriously and coldly about love. He understood why this\r\nwas so.\r\n\r\n"If poetry does not solve questions that seem so important," said\r\nYartsev, "you should turn to works on technical subjects, criminal\r\nlaw, or finance, read scientific pamphlets. What need is there to\r\ndiscuss in \'Romeo and Juliet,\' liberty of speech, or the disinfecting\r\nof prisons, instead of love, when you can find all that in special\r\narticles and textbooks?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s pushing it to the extreme," Kostya interrupted. "We are not\r\ntalking of giants like Shakespeare or Goethe; we are talking of the\r\nhundreds of talented mediocre writers, who would be infinitely more\r\nvaluable if they would let love alone, and would employ themselves\r\nin spreading knowledge and humane ideas among the masses."\r\n\r\nKish, lisping and speaking a little through his nose, began telling\r\nthe story of a novel he had lately been reading. He spoke\r\ncircumstantially and without haste. Three minutes passed, then five,\r\nthen ten, and no one could make out what he was talking about, and\r\nhis face grew more and more indifferent, and his eyes more and more\r\nblank.\r\n\r\n"Kish, do be quick over it," Yulia Sergeyevna could not resist\r\nsaying; "it\'s really agonizing!"\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Kish!" Kostya shouted to him.\r\n\r\nThey all laughed, and Kish with them.\r\n\r\nFyodor came in. Flushing red in patches, he greeted them all in a\r\nnervous flurry, and led his brother away into the study. Of late\r\nhe had taken to avoiding the company of more than one person at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n"Let the young people laugh, while we speak from the heart in here,"\r\nhe said, settling himself in a deep arm-chair at a distance from\r\nthe lamp. "It\'s a long time, my dear brother, since we\'ve seen each\r\nother. How long is it since you were at the warehouse? I think it\r\nmust be a week."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there\'s nothing for me to do there. And I must confess that\r\nthe old man wearies me."\r\n\r\n"Of course, they could get on at the warehouse without you and me,\r\nbut one must have some occupation. \'In the sweat of thy brow thou\r\nshalt eat bread,\' as it is written. God loves work."\r\n\r\nPyotr brought in a glass of tea on a tray. Fyodor drank it without\r\nsugar, and asked for more. He drank a great deal of tea, and could\r\nget through as many as ten glasses in the evening.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, brother," he said, getting up and going to his\r\nbrother. "Laying aside philosophic subtleties, you must get elected\r\non to the town council, and little by little we will get you on to\r\nthe local Board, and then to be an alderman. And as time goes on\r\n--you are a clever man and well-educated--you will be noticed\r\nin Petersburg and asked to go there--active men on the provincial\r\nassemblies and town councils are all the fashion there now--and\r\nbefore you are fifty you\'ll be a privy councillor, and have a ribbon\r\nacross your shoulders."\r\n\r\nLaptev made no answer; he knew that all this--being a privy\r\ncouncillor and having a ribbon over his shoulder--was what Fyodor\r\ndesired for himself, and he did not know what to say.\r\n\r\nThe brothers sat still and said nothing. Fyodor opened his watch\r\nand for a long, long time gazed into it with strained attention,\r\nas though he wanted to detect the motion of the hand, and the\r\nexpression of his face struck Laptev as strange.\r\n\r\nThey were summoned to supper. Laptev went into the dining-room,\r\nwhile Fyodor remained in the study. The argument was over and Yartsev\r\nwas speaking in the tones of a professor giving a lecture:\r\n\r\n"Owing to differences of climate, of energy, of tastes, of age,\r\nequality among men is physically impossible. But civilised man can\r\nmake this inequality innocuous, as he has already done with bogs\r\nand bears. A learned man succeeded in making a cat, a mouse, a\r\nfalcon, a sparrow, all eat out of one plate; and education, one\r\nmust hope, will do the same thing with men. Life continually\r\nprogresses, civilisation makes enormous advances before our eyes,\r\nand obviously a time will come when we shall think, for instance,\r\nthe present condition of the factory population as absurd as we now\r\ndo the state of serfdom, in which girls were exchanged for dogs."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t be for a long while, a very long while," said Kostya,\r\nwith a laugh, "not till Rothschild thinks his cellars full of gold\r\nabsurd, and till then the workers may bend their backs and die of\r\nhunger. No; that\'s not it. We mustn\'t wait for it; we must struggle\r\nfor it. Do you suppose because the cat eats out of the same saucer\r\nas the mouse--do you suppose that she is influenced by a sense\r\nof conscious intelligence? Not a bit of it! She\'s made to do it by\r\nforce."\r\n\r\n"Fyodor and I are rich; our father\'s a capitalist, a millionaire.\r\nYou will have to struggle with us," said Laptev, rubbing his forehead\r\nwith his hand. "Struggle with me is an idea I cannot grasp. I am\r\nrich, but what has money given me so far? What has this power given\r\nme? In what way am I happier than you? My childhood was slavery,\r\nand money did not save me from the birch. When Nina was ill and\r\ndied, my money did not help her. If people don\'t care for me, I\r\ncan\'t make them like me if I spend a hundred million."\r\n\r\n"But you can do a great deal of good," said Kish.\r\n\r\n"Good, indeed! You spoke to me yesterday of a mathematical man who\r\nis looking for a job. Believe me, I can do as little for him as you\r\ncan. I can give money, but that\'s not what he wants--I asked a\r\nwell-known musician to help a poor violinist, and this is what he\r\nanswered: \'You apply to me just because you are not a musician\r\nyourself.\' In the same way I say to you that you apply for help to\r\nme so confidently because you\'ve never been in the position of a\r\nrich man."\r\n\r\n"Why you bring in the comparison with a well-known musician I don\'t\r\nunderstand!" said Yulia Sergeyevna, and she flushed crimson. "What\r\nhas the well-known musician to do with it!"\r\n\r\nHer face was quivering with hatred, and she dropped her eyes to\r\nconceal the feeling. And not only her husband, but all the men\r\nsitting at the table, knew what the look in her face meant.\r\n\r\n"What has the well-known musician got to do with it?" she said\r\nslowly. "Why, nothing\'s easier than helping some one poor."\r\n\r\nSilence followed. Pyotr handed the woodcock, but they all refused\r\nit, and ate nothing but salad. Laptev did not remember what he had\r\nsaid, but it was clear to him that it was not his words that were\r\nhateful, but the fact of his meddling in the conversation at all.\r\n\r\nAfter supper he went into his study; intently, with a beating heart,\r\nexpecting further humiliation, he listened to what was going on in\r\nthe hall. An argument had sprung up there again. Then Yartsev sat\r\ndown to the piano and played a sentimental song. He was a man of\r\nvaried accomplishments; he could play and sing, and even perform\r\nconjuring tricks.\r\n\r\n"You may please yourselves, my friends, but I\'m not going to stay\r\nat home," said Yulia. "We must go somewhere."\r\n\r\nThey decided to drive out of town, and sent Kish to the merchant\'s\r\nclub to order a three-horse sledge. They did not ask Laptev to go\r\nwith them because he did not usually join these expeditions, and\r\nbecause his brother was sitting with him; but he took it to mean\r\nthat his society bored them, and that he was not wanted in their\r\nlight-hearted youthful company. And his vexation, his bitter feeling,\r\nwas so intense that he almost shed tears. He was positively glad\r\nthat he was treated so ungraciously, that he was scorned, that he\r\nwas a stupid, dull husband, a money-bag; and it seemed to him, that\r\nhe would have been even more glad if his wife were to deceive him\r\nthat night with his best friend, and were afterwards to acknowledge\r\nit, looking at him with hatred. . . . He was jealous on her account\r\nof their student friends, of actors, of singers, of Yartsev, even\r\nof casual acquaintances; and now he had a passionate longing for\r\nher really to be unfaithful to him. He longed to find her in another\r\nman\'s arms, and to be rid of this nightmare forever. Fyodor was\r\ndrinking tea, gulping it noisily. But he, too, got up to go.\r\n\r\n"Our old father must have got cataract," he said, as he put on his\r\nfur coat. "His sight has become very poor."\r\n\r\nLaptev put on his coat, too, and went out. After seeing his brother\r\npart of the way home, he took a sledge and drove to Yar\'s.\r\n\r\n"And this is family happiness!" he said, jeering at himself. "This\r\nis love!"\r\n\r\nHis teeth were chattering, and he did not know if it were jealousy\r\nor something else. He walked about near the tables; listened to a\r\ncomic singer in the hall. He had not a single phrase ready if he\r\nshould meet his own party; and he felt sure beforehand that if he\r\nmet his wife, he would only smile pitifully and not cleverly, and\r\nthat every one would understand what feeling had induced him to\r\ncome here. He was bewildered by the electric light, the loud music,\r\nthe smell of powder, and the fact that the ladies he met looked at\r\nhim. He stood at the doors trying to see and to hear what was going\r\non in the private rooms, and it seemed to him that he was somehow\r\nplaying a mean, contemptible part on a level with the comic singers\r\nand those ladies. Then he went to Strelna, but he found none of his\r\ncircle there, either; and only when on the way home he was again\r\ndriving up to Yar\'s, a three-horse sledge noisily overtook him. The\r\ndriver was drunk and shouting, and he could hear Yartsev laughing:\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nLaptev returned home between three and four. Yulia Sergeyevna was\r\nin bed. Noticing that she was not asleep, he went up to her and\r\nsaid sharply:\r\n\r\n"I understand your repulsion, your hatred, but you might spare me\r\nbefore other people; you might conceal your feelings."\r\n\r\nShe got up and sat on the bed with her legs dangling. Her eyes\r\nlooked big and black in the lamplight.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," she said.\r\n\r\nHe could not utter a single word from excitement and the trembling\r\nof his whole body; he stood facing her and was dumb. She trembled,\r\ntoo, and sat with the air of a criminal waiting for explanations.\r\n\r\n"How I suffer!" he said at last, and he clutched his head. "I\'m in\r\nhell, and I\'m out of my mind."\r\n\r\n"And do you suppose it\'s easy for me?" she asked, with a quiver in\r\nher voice. "God alone knows what I go through."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been my wife for six months, but you haven\'t a spark of\r\nlove for me in your heart. There\'s no hope, not one ray of light!\r\nWhy did you marry me?" Laptev went on with despair. "Why? What demon\r\nthrust you into my arms? What did you hope for? What did you want?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with terror, as though she were afraid he would\r\nkill her.\r\n\r\n"Did I attract you? Did you like me?" he went on, gasping for breath.\r\n"No. Then what? What? Tell me what?" he cried. "Oh, the cursed\r\nmoney! The cursed money!"\r\n\r\n"I swear to God, no!" she cried, and she crossed herself. She seemed\r\nto shrink under the insult, and for the first time he heard her\r\ncrying. "I swear to God, no!" she repeated. "I didn\'t think about\r\nyour money; I didn\'t want it. I simply thought I should do wrong\r\nif I refused you. I was afraid of spoiling your life and mine. And\r\nnow I am suffering for my mistake. I\'m suffering unbearably!"\r\n\r\nShe sobbed bitterly, and he saw that she was hurt; and not knowing\r\nwhat to say, dropped down on the carpet before her.\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough; that\'s enough," he muttered. "I insulted you because\r\nI love you madly." He suddenly kissed her foot and passionately\r\nhugged it. "If only a spark of love," he muttered. "Come, lie to\r\nme; tell me a lie! Don\'t say it\'s a mistake! . . ."\r\n\r\nBut she went on crying, and he felt that she was only enduring his\r\ncaresses as an inevitable consequence of her mistake. And the foot\r\nhe had kissed she drew under her like a bird. He felt sorry for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe got into bed and covered her head over; he undressed and got\r\ninto bed, too. In the morning they both felt confused and did not\r\nknow what to talk about, and he even fancied she walked unsteadily\r\non the foot he had kissed.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner Panaurov came to say good-bye. Yulia had an irresistible\r\ndesire to go to her own home; it would be nice, she thought, to go\r\naway and have a rest from married life, from the embarrassment and\r\nthe continual consciousness that she had done wrong. It was decided\r\nat dinner that she should set off with Panaurov, and stay with her\r\nfather for two or three weeks until she was tired of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nShe travelled with Panaurov in a reserved compartment; he had on\r\nhis head an astrachan cap of peculiar shape.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Petersburg did not satisfy me," he said, drawling, with a\r\nsigh. "They promise much, but nothing definite. Yes, my dear girl.\r\nI have been a Justice of the Peace, a member of the local Board,\r\nchairman of the Board of Magistrates, and finally councillor of the\r\nprovincial administration. I think I have served my country and\r\nhave earned the right to receive attention; but--would you believe\r\nit?--I can never succeed in wringing from the authorities a post\r\nin another town. . . ."\r\n\r\nPanaurov closed his eyes and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t recognise me," he went on, as though dropping asleep.\r\n"Of course I\'m not an administrator of genius, but, on the other\r\nhand, I\'m a decent, honest man, and nowadays even that\'s something\r\nrare. I regret to say I have not been always quite straightforward\r\nwith women, but in my relations with the Russian government I\'ve\r\nalways been a gentleman. But enough of that," he said, opening his\r\neyes; "let us talk of you. What put it into your head to visit your\r\npapa so suddenly?"\r\n\r\n"Well. . . . I had a little misunderstanding with my husband," said\r\nYulia, looking at his cap.\r\n\r\n"Yes. What a queer fellow he is! All the Laptevs are queer. Your\r\nhusband\'s all right--he\'s nothing out of the way, but his brother\r\nFyodor is a perfect fool."\r\n\r\nPanaurov sighed and asked seriously:\r\n\r\n"And have you a lover yet?"\r\n\r\nYulia looked at him in amazement and laughed.\r\n\r\n"Goodness knows what you\'re talking about."\r\n\r\nIt was past ten o\'clock when they got out at a big station and had\r\nsupper. When the train went on again Panaurov took off his greatcoat\r\nand his cap, and sat down beside Yulia.\r\n\r\n"You are very charming, I must tell you," he began. "Excuse me for\r\nthe eating-house comparison, but you remind me of fresh salted\r\ncucumber; it still smells of the hotbed, so to speak, and yet has\r\na smack of the salt and a scent of fennel about it. As time goes\r\non you will make a magnificent woman, a wonderful, exquisite woman.\r\nIf this trip of ours had happened five years ago," he sighed, "I\r\nshould have felt it my duty to join the ranks of your adorers, but\r\nnow, alas, I\'m a veteran on the retired list."\r\n\r\nHe smiled mournfully, but at the same time graciously, and put his\r\narm round her waist.\r\n\r\n"You must be mad!" she said; she flushed crimson and was so frightened\r\nthat her hands and feet turned cold.\r\n\r\n"Leave off, Grigory Nikolaevitch!"\r\n\r\n"What are you afraid of, dear?" he asked softly. "What is there\r\ndreadful about it? It\'s simply that you\'re not used to it."\r\n\r\nIf a woman protested he always interpreted it as a sign that he had\r\nmade an impression on her and attracted her. Holding Yulia round\r\nthe waist, he kissed her firmly on the cheek, then on the lips, in\r\nthe full conviction that he was giving her intense gratification.\r\nYulia recovered from her alarm and confusion, and began laughing.\r\nHe kissed her once more and said, as he put on his ridiculous cap:\r\n\r\n"That is all that the old veteran can give you. A Turkish Pasha, a\r\nkind-hearted old fellow, was presented by some one--or inherited,\r\nI fancy it was--a whole harem. When his beautiful young wives\r\ndrew up in a row before him, he walked round them, kissed each one\r\nof them, and said: \'That is all that I am equal to giving you.\' And\r\nthat\'s just what I say, too."\r\n\r\nAll this struck her as stupid and extraordinary, and amused her.\r\nShe felt mischievous. Standing up on the seat and humming, she got\r\na box of sweets from the shelf, and throwing him a piece of chocolate,\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n"Catch!"\r\n\r\nHe caught it. With a loud laugh she threw him another sweet, then\r\na third, and he kept catching them and putting them into his mouth,\r\nlooking at her with imploring eyes; and it seemed to her that in\r\nhis face, his features, his expression, there was a great deal that\r\nwas feminine and childlike. And when, out of breath, she sat down\r\non the seat and looked at him, laughing, he tapped her cheek with\r\ntwo fingers, and said as though he were vexed:\r\n\r\n"Naughty girl!"\r\n\r\n"Take it," she said, giving him the box. "I don\'t care for sweet\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nHe ate up the sweets--every one of them, and locked the empty box\r\nin his trunk; he liked boxes with pictures on them.\r\n\r\n"That\'s mischief enough, though," he said. "It\'s time for the veteran\r\nto go bye-bye."\r\n\r\nHe took out of his hold-all a Bokhara dressing-gown and a pillow,\r\nlay down, and covered himself with the dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, darling!" he said softly, and sighed as though his\r\nwhole body ached.\r\n\r\nAnd soon a snore was heard. Without the slightest feeling of\r\nconstraint, she, too, lay down and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen next morning she drove through her native town from the station\r\nhomewards, the streets seemed to her empty and deserted. The snow\r\nlooked grey, and the houses small, as though some one had squashed\r\nthem. She was met by a funeral procession: the dead body was carried\r\nin an open coffin with banners.\r\n\r\n"Meeting a funeral, they say, is lucky," she thought.\r\n\r\nThere were white bills pasted in the windows of the house where\r\nNina Fyodorovna used to live.\r\n\r\nWith a sinking at her heart she drove into her own courtyard and\r\nrang at the door. It was opened by a servant she did not know--a\r\nplump, sleepy-looking girl wearing a warm wadded jacket. As she\r\nwent upstairs Yulia remembered how Laptev had declared his love\r\nthere, but now the staircase was unscrubbed, covered with foot-marks.\r\nUpstairs in the cold passage patients were waiting in their out-door\r\ncoats. And for some reason her heart beat violently, and she was\r\nso excited she could scarcely walk.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had grown even stouter, was sitting with a brick-red\r\nface and dishevelled hair, drinking tea. Seeing his daughter, he\r\nwas greatly delighted, and even lacrymose. She thought that she was\r\nthe only joy in this old man\'s life, and much moved, she embraced\r\nhim warmly, and told him she would stay a long time--till Easter.\r\nAfter taking off her things in her own room, she went back to the\r\ndining-room to have tea with him. He was pacing up and down with\r\nhis hands in his pockets, humming, "Ru-ru-ru"; this meant that he\r\nwas dissatisfied with something.\r\n\r\n"You have a gay time of it in Moscow," he said. "I am very glad for\r\nyour sake. . . . I\'m an old man and I need nothing. I shall soon\r\ngive up the ghost and set you all free. And the wonder is that my\r\nhide is so tough, that I\'m alive still! It\'s amazing!"\r\n\r\nHe said that he was a tough old ass that every one rode on. They\r\nhad thrust on him the care of Nina Fyodorovna, the worry of her\r\nchildren, and of her burial; and that coxcomb Panaurov would not\r\ntrouble himself about it, and had even borrowed a hundred roubles\r\nfrom him and had never paid it back.\r\n\r\n"Take me to Moscow and put me in a madhouse," said the doctor. "I\'m\r\nmad; I\'m a simple child, as I still put faith in truth and justice."\r\n\r\nThen he found fault with her husband for his short-sightedness in\r\nnot buying houses that were being sold so cheaply. And now it seemed\r\nto Yulia that she was not the one joy in this old man\'s life. While\r\nhe was seeing his patients, and afterwards going his rounds, she\r\nwalked through all the rooms, not knowing what to do or what to\r\nthink about. She had already grown strange to her own town and her\r\nown home. She felt no inclination to go into the streets or see her\r\nfriends; and at the thought of her old friends and her life as a\r\ngirl, she felt no sadness nor regret for the past.\r\n\r\nIn the evening she dressed a little more smartly and went to the\r\nevening service. But there were only poor people in the church, and\r\nher splendid fur coat and hat made no impression. And it seemed to\r\nher that there was some change in the church as well as in herself.\r\nIn old days she had loved it when they read the prayers for the day\r\nat evening service, and the choir sang anthems such as "I will open\r\nmy lips." She liked moving slowly in the crowd to the priest who\r\nstood in the middle of the church, and then to feel the holy oil\r\non her forehead; now she only waited for the service to be over.\r\nAnd now, going out of the church, she was only afraid that beggars\r\nwould ask for alms; it was such a bore to have to stop and feel for\r\nher pockets; besides, she had no coppers in her pocket now--nothing\r\nbut roubles.\r\n\r\nShe went to bed early, and was a long time in going to sleep. She\r\nkept dreaming of portraits of some sort, and of the funeral procession\r\nshe had met that morning. The open coffin with the dead body was\r\ncarried into the yard, and brought to a standstill at the door;\r\nthen the coffin was swung backwards and forwards on a sheet, and\r\ndashed violently against the door. Yulia woke and jumped up in\r\nalarm. There really was a bang at the door, and the wire of the\r\nbell rustled against the wall, though no ring was to be heard.\r\n\r\nThe doctor coughed. Then she heard the servant go downstairs, and\r\nthen come back.\r\n\r\n"Madam!" she said, and knocked at the door. "Madam!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said Yulia.\r\n\r\n"A telegram for you!"\r\n\r\nYulia went out to her with a candle. Behind the servant stood the\r\ndoctor, in his night-clothes and greatcoat, and he, too, had a\r\ncandle in his hand. "Our bell is broken," he said, yawning sleepily.\r\n"It ought to have been mended long ago."\r\n\r\nYulia broke open the telegram and read:\r\n\r\n"We drink to your health.--YARTSEV, KOTCHEVOY."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what idiots!" she said, and burst out laughing; and her heart\r\nfelt light and gay.\r\n\r\nGoing back into her room, she quietly washed and dressed, then she\r\nspent a long time in packing her things, until it was daylight, and\r\nat midday she set off for Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nIn Holy Week the Laptevs went to an exhibition of pictures in the\r\nschool of painting. The whole family went together in the Moscow\r\nfashion, the little girls, the governess, Kostya, and all.\r\n\r\nLaptev knew the names of all the well-known painters, and never\r\nmissed an exhibition. He used sometimes to paint little landscape\r\npaintings when he was in the country in the summer, and he fancied\r\nhe had a good deal of taste, and that if he had studied he might\r\nhave made a good painter. When he was abroad he sometimes used to\r\ngo to curio shops, examining the antiques with the air of a connoisseur\r\nand giving his opinion on them. When he bought any article he gave\r\njust what the shopkeeper liked to ask for it and his purchase\r\nremained afterwards in a box in the coach-house till it disappeared\r\naltogether. Or going into a print shop, he would slowly and attentively\r\nexamine the engravings and the bronzes, making various remarks on\r\nthem, and would buy a common frame or a box of wretched prints. At\r\nhome he had pictures always of large dimensions but of inferior\r\nquality; the best among them were badly hung. It had happened to\r\nhim more than once to pay large sums for things which had afterwards\r\nturned out to be forgeries of the grossest kind. And it was remarkable\r\nthat, though as a rule timid in the affairs of life, he was exceedingly\r\nbold and self-confident at a picture exhibition. Why?\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna looked at the pictures as her husband did, through\r\nher open fist or an opera-glass, and was surprised that the people\r\nin the pictures were like live people, and the trees like real\r\ntrees. But she did not understand art, and it seemed to her that\r\nmany pictures in the exhibition were alike, and she imagined that\r\nthe whole object in painting was that the figures and objects should\r\nstand out as though they were real, when you looked at the picture\r\nthrough your open fist.\r\n\r\n"That forest is Shiskin\'s," her husband explained to her. "He always\r\npaints the same thing. . . . But notice snow\'s never such a lilac\r\ncolour as that. . . . And that boy\'s left arm is shorter than his\r\nright."\r\n\r\nWhen they were all tired and Laptev had gone to look for Kostya,\r\nthat they might go home, Yulia stopped indifferently before a small\r\nlandscape. In the foreground was a stream, over it a little wooden\r\nbridge; on the further side a path that disappeared in the dark\r\ngrass; a field on the right; a copse; near it a camp fire--no\r\ndoubt of watchers by night; and in the distance there was a glow\r\nof the evening sunset.\r\n\r\nYulia imagined walking herself along the little bridge, and then\r\nalong the little path further and further, while all round was\r\nstillness, the drowsy landrails calling and the fire flickering in\r\nthe distance. And for some reason she suddenly began to feel that\r\nshe had seen those very clouds that stretched across the red part\r\nof the sky, and that copse, and that field before, many times before.\r\nShe felt lonely, and longed to walk on and on along the path; and\r\nthere, in the glow of sunset was the calm reflection of something\r\nunearthly, eternal.\r\n\r\n"How finely that\'s painted!" she said, surprised that the picture\r\nhad suddenly become intelligible to her.\r\n\r\n"Look, Alyosha! Do you see how peaceful it is?"\r\n\r\nShe began trying to explain why she liked the landscape so much,\r\nbut neither Kostya nor her husband understood her. She kept looking\r\nat the picture with a mournful smile, and the fact that the others\r\nsaw nothing special in it troubled her. Then she began walking\r\nthrough the rooms and looking at the pictures again. She tried to\r\nunderstand them and no longer thought that a great many of them\r\nwere alike. When, on returning home, for the first time she looked\r\nattentively at the big picture that hung over the piano in the\r\ndrawing-room, she felt a dislike for it, and said:\r\n\r\n"What an idea to have pictures like that!"\r\n\r\nAnd after that the gilt cornices, the Venetian looking-glasses with\r\nflowers on them, the pictures of the same sort as the one that hung\r\nover the piano, and also her husband\'s and Kostya\'s reflections\r\nupon art, aroused in her a feeling of dreariness and vexation, even\r\nof hatred.\r\n\r\nLife went on its ordinary course from day to day with no promise\r\nof anything special. The theatrical season was over, the warm days\r\nhad come. There was a long spell of glorious weather. One morning\r\nthe Laptevs attended the district court to hear Kostya, who had\r\nbeen appointed by the court to defend some one. They were late in\r\nstarting, and reached the court after the examination of the witnesses\r\nhad begun. A soldier in the reserve was accused of theft and\r\nhousebreaking. There were a great number of witnesses, washerwomen;\r\nthey all testified that the accused was often in the house of their\r\nemployer--a woman who kept a laundry. At the Feast of the Exaltation\r\nof the Cross he came late in the evening and began asking for money;\r\nhe wanted a pick-me-up, as he had been drinking, but no one gave\r\nhim anything. Then he went away, but an hour afterwards he came\r\nback, and brought with him some beer and a soft gingerbread cake\r\nfor the little girl. They drank and sang songs almost till daybreak,\r\nand when in the morning they looked about, the lock of the door\r\nleading up into the attic was broken, and of the linen three men\'s\r\nshirts, a petticoat, and two sheets were missing. Kostya asked each\r\nwitness sarcastically whether she had not drunk the beer the accused\r\nhad brought. Evidently he was insinuating that the washerwomen had\r\nstolen the linen themselves. He delivered his speech without the\r\nslightest nervousness, looking angrily at the jury.\r\n\r\nHe explained what robbery with housebreaking meant, and the difference\r\nbetween that and simple theft. He spoke very circumstantially and\r\nconvincingly, displaying an unusual talent for speaking at length\r\nand in a serious tone about what had been know to every one long\r\nbefore. And it was difficult to make out exactly what he was aiming\r\nat. From his long speech the foreman of the jury could only have\r\ndeduced "that it was housebreaking but not robbery, as the washerwomen\r\nhad sold the linen for drink themselves; or, if there had been\r\nrobbery, there had not been housebreaking." But obviously, he said\r\njust what was wanted, as his speech moved the jury and the audience,\r\nand was very much liked. When they gave a verdict of acquittal,\r\nYulia nodded to Kostya, and afterwards pressed his hand warmly.\r\n\r\nIn May the Laptevs moved to a country villa at Sokolniki. By that\r\ntime Yulia was expecting a baby.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nMore than a year had passed. Yulia and Yartsev were lying on the\r\ngrass at Sokolniki not far from the embankment of the Yaroslav\r\nrailway; a little distance away Kotchevoy was lying with hands under\r\nhis head, looking at the sky. All three had been for a walk, and\r\nwere waiting for the six o\'clock train to pass to go home to tea.\r\n\r\n"Mothers see something extraordinary in their children, that is\r\nordained by nature," said Yulia. "A mother will stand for hours\r\ntogether by the baby\'s cot looking at its little ears and eyes and\r\nnose, and fascinated by them. If any one else kisses her baby the\r\npoor thing imagines that it gives him immense pleasure. And a mother\r\ntalks of nothing but her baby. I know that weakness in mothers, and\r\nI keep watch over myself, but my Olga really is exceptional. How\r\nshe looks at me when I\'m nursing her! How she laughs! She\'s only\r\neight months old, but, upon my word, I\'ve never seen such intelligent\r\neyes in a child of three."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, by the way," asked Yartsev: "which do you love most--\r\nyour husband or your baby?"\r\n\r\nYulia shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she said. "I never was so very fond of my husband,\r\nand Olga is in reality my first love. You know that I did not marry\r\nAlexey for love. In old days I was foolish and miserable, and thought\r\nthat I had ruined my life and his, and now I see that love is not\r\nnecessary--that it is all nonsense."\r\n\r\n"But if it is not love, what feeling is it that binds you to your\r\nhusband? Why do you go on living with him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. . . . I suppose it must be habit. I respect him, I\r\nmiss him when he\'s away for long, but that\'s--not love. He is a\r\nclever, honest man, and that\'s enough to make me happy. He is very\r\nkind and good-hearted. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Alyosha\'s intelligent, Alyosha\'s good," said Kostya, raising his\r\nhead lazily; "but, my dear girl, to find out that he is intelligent,\r\ngood, and interesting, you have to eat a hundredweight of salt with\r\nhim. . . . And what\'s the use of his goodness and intelligence? He\r\ncan fork out money as much as you want, but when character is needed\r\nto resist insolence or aggressiveness, he is faint-hearted and\r\novercome with nervousness. People like your amiable Alyosha are\r\nsplendid people, but they are no use at all for fighting. In fact,\r\nthey are no use for anything."\r\n\r\nAt last the train came in sight. Coils of perfectly pink smoke from\r\nthe funnels floated over the copse, and two windows in the last\r\ncompartment flashed so brilliantly in the sun, that it hurt their\r\neyes to look at it.\r\n\r\n"Tea-time!" said Yulia Sergeyevna, getting up.\r\n\r\nShe had grown somewhat stouter of late, and her movements were\r\nalready a little matronly, a little indolent.\r\n\r\n"It\'s bad to be without love though," said Yartsev, walking behind\r\nher. "We talk and read of nothing else but love, but we do very\r\nlittle loving ourselves, and that\'s really bad."\r\n\r\n"All that\'s nonsense, Ivan Gavrilitch," said Yulia. "That\'s not\r\nwhat gives happiness."\r\n\r\nThey had tea in the little garden, where mignonette, stocks, and\r\ntobacco plants were in flower, and spikes of early gladiolus were\r\njust opening. Yartsev and Kotchevoy could see from Yulia\'s face\r\nthat she was passing through a happy period of inward peace and\r\nserenity, that she wanted nothing but what she had, and they, too,\r\nhad a feeling of peace and comfort in their hearts. Whatever was\r\nsaid sounded apt and clever; the pines were lovely--the fragrance\r\nof them was exquisite as it had never been before; and the cream\r\nwas very nice; and Sasha was a good, intelligent child.\r\n\r\nAfter tea Yartsev sang songs, accompanying himself on the piano,\r\nwhile Yulia and Kotchevoy sat listening in silence, though Yulia\r\ngot up from time to time, and went softly indoors, to take a look\r\nat the baby and at Lida, who had been in bed for the last two days\r\nfeverish and eating nothing.\r\n\r\n"My friend, my tender friend," sang Yartsev. "No, my friends, I\'ll\r\nbe hanged if I understand why you are all so against love!" he said,\r\nflinging back his head. "If I weren\'t busy for fifteen hours of the\r\ntwenty-four, I should certainly fall in love."\r\n\r\nSupper was served on the verandah; it was warm and still, but Yulia\r\nwrapped herself in a shawl and complained of the damp. When it got\r\ndark, she seemed not quite herself; she kept shivering and begging\r\nher visitors to stay a little longer. She regaled them with wine,\r\nand after supper ordered brandy to keep them from going. She didn\'t\r\nwant to be left alone with the children and the servants.\r\n\r\n"We summer visitors are getting up a performance for the children,"\r\nshe said. "We have got everything--a stage and actors; we are\r\nonly at a loss for a play. Two dozen plays of different sorts have\r\nbeen sent us, but there isn\'t one that is suitable. Now, you are\r\nfond of the theatre, and are so good at history," she said, addressing\r\nYartsev. "Write an historical play for us."\r\n\r\n"Well, I might."\r\n\r\nThe men drank up all the brandy, and prepared to go.\r\n\r\nIt was past ten, and for summer-villa people that was late.\r\n\r\n"How dark it is! One can\'t see a bit," said Yulia, as she went with\r\nthem to the gate. "I don\'t know how you\'ll find your way. But, isn\'t\r\nit cold?"\r\n\r\nShe wrapped herself up more closely and walked back to the porch.\r\n\r\n"I suppose my Alexey\'s playing cards somewhere," she called to them.\r\n"Good-night!"\r\n\r\nAfter the lighted rooms nothing could be seen. Yartsev and Kostya\r\ngroped their way like blind men to the railway embankment and crossed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"One can\'t see a thing," said Kostya in his bass voice, standing\r\nstill and gazing at the sky. "And the stars, the stars, they are\r\nlike new three-penny-bits. Gavrilitch!"\r\n\r\n"Ah?" Yartsev responded somewhere in the darkness.\r\n\r\n"I say, one can\'t see a thing. Where are you?"\r\n\r\nYartsev went up to him whistling, and took his arm.\r\n\r\n"Hi, there, you summer visitors!" Kostya shouted at the top of his\r\nvoice. "We\'ve caught a socialist."\r\n\r\nWhen he was exhilarated he was always very rowdy, shouting, wrangling\r\nwith policemen and cabdrivers, singing, and laughing violently.\r\n\r\n"Nature be damned," he shouted.\r\n\r\n"Come, come," said Yartsev, trying to pacify him. "You mustn\'t.\r\nPlease don\'t."\r\n\r\nSoon the friends grew accustomed to the darkness, and were able to\r\ndistinguish the outlines of the tall pines and telegraph posts.\r\nFrom time to time the sound of whistles reached them from the station\r\nand the telegraph wires hummed plaintively. From the copse itself\r\nthere came no sound, and there was a feeling of pride, strength,\r\nand mystery in its silence, and on the right it seemed that the\r\ntops of the pines were almost touching the sky. The friends found\r\ntheir path and walked along it. There it was quite dark, and it was\r\nonly from the long strip of sky dotted with stars, and from the\r\nfirmly trodden earth under their feet, that they could tell they\r\nwere walking along a path. They walked along side by side in silence,\r\nand it seemed to both of them that people were coming to meet them.\r\nTheir tipsy exhilaration passed off. The fancy came into Yartsev\'s\r\nmind that perhaps that copse was haunted by the spirits of the\r\nMuscovite Tsars, boyars, and patriarchs, and he was on the point\r\nof telling Kostya about it, but he checked himself.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the town gate there was a faint light of dawn in\r\nthe sky. Still in silence, Yartsev and Kotchevoy walked along the\r\nwooden pavement, by the cheap summer cottages, eating-houses,\r\ntimber-stacks. Under the arch of interlacing branches, the damp air\r\nwas fragrant of lime-trees, and then a broad, long street opened\r\nbefore them, and on it not a soul, not a light. . . . When they\r\nreached the Red Pond, it was daylight.\r\n\r\n"Moscow--it\'s a town that will have to suffer a great deal more,"\r\nsaid Yartsev, looking at the Alexyevsky Monastery.\r\n\r\n"What put that into your head?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I love Moscow."\r\n\r\nBoth Yartsev and Kostya had been born in Moscow, and adored the\r\ntown, and felt for some reason antagonistic to every other town.\r\nBoth were convinced that Moscow was a remarkable town, and Russia\r\na remarkable country. In the Crimea, in the Caucasus, and abroad,\r\nthey felt dull, uncomfortable, and ill at ease, and they thought\r\ntheir grey Moscow weather very pleasant and healthy. And when the\r\nrain lashed at the window-panes and it got dark early, and when the\r\nwalls of the churches and houses looked a drab, dismal colour, days\r\nwhen one doesn\'t know what to put on when one is going out--such\r\ndays excited them agreeably.\r\n\r\nAt last near the station they took a cab.\r\n\r\n"It really would be nice to write an historical play," said Yartsev,\r\n"but not about the Lyapunovs or the Godunovs, but of the times of\r\nYaroslav or of Monomach. . . . I hate all historical plays except\r\nthe monologue of Pimen. When you have to do with some historical\r\nauthority or even read a textbook of Russian history, you feel that\r\nevery one in Russia is exceptionally talented, gifted, and interesting;\r\nbut when I see an historical play at the theatre, Russian life\r\nbegins to seem stupid, morbid, and not original."\r\n\r\nNear Dmitrovka the friends separated, and Yartsev went on to his\r\nlodging in Nikitsky Street. He sat half dozing, swaying from side\r\nto side, and pondering on the play. He suddenly imagined a terrible\r\ndin, a clanging noise, and shouts in some unknown language, that\r\nmight have been Kalmuck, and a village wrapped in flames, and forests\r\nnear covered with hoarfrost and soft pink in the glow of the fire,\r\nvisible for miles around, and so clearly that every little fir-tree\r\ncould be distinguished, and savage men darting about the village\r\non horseback and on foot, and as red as the glow in the sky.\r\n\r\n"The Polovtsy," thought Yartsev.\r\n\r\nOne of them, a terrible old man with a bloodstained face all scorched\r\nfrom the fire, binds to his saddle a young girl with a white Russian\r\nface, and the girl looks sorrowful, understanding. Yartsev flung\r\nback his head and woke up.\r\n\r\n"My friend, my tender friend . . ." he hummed.\r\n\r\nAs he paid the cabman and went up his stairs, he could not shake\r\noff his dreaminess; he saw the flames catching the village, and the\r\nforest beginning to crackle and smoke. A huge, wild bear frantic\r\nwith terror rushed through the village. . . . And the girl tied to\r\nthe saddle was still looking.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he went into his room it was broad daylight. Two candles\r\nwere burning by some open music on the piano. On the sofa lay Polina\r\nRazsudin wearing a black dress and a sash, with a newspaper in her\r\nhand, fast asleep. She must have been playing late, waiting for\r\nYartsev to come home, and, tired of waiting, fell asleep.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, she\'s worn out," he thought.\r\n\r\nCarefully taking the newspaper out of her hands, he covered her\r\nwith a rug. He put out the candles and went into his bedroom. As\r\nhe got into bed, he still thought of his historical play, and the\r\ntune of "My friend, my tender friend" was still ringing in his\r\nhead. . . .\r\n\r\nTwo days later Laptev looked in upon him for a moment to tell him\r\nthat Lida was ill with diphtheria, and that Yulia Sergeyevna and\r\nher baby had caught it from her, and five days later came the news\r\nthat Lida and Yulia were recovering, but the baby was dead, and\r\nthat the Laptevs had left their villa at Sokolniki and had hastened\r\nback to Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIt had become distasteful to Laptev to be long at home. His wife\r\nwas constantly away in the lodge declaring that she had to look\r\nafter the little girls, but he knew that she did not go to the lodge\r\nto give them lessons but to cry in Kostya\'s room. The ninth day\r\ncame, then the twentieth, and then the fortieth, and still he had\r\nto go to the cemetery to listen to the requiem, and then to wear\r\nhimself out for a whole day and night thinking of nothing but that\r\nunhappy baby, and trying to comfort his wife with all sorts of\r\ncommonplace expressions. He went rarely to the warehouse now, and\r\nspent most of his time in charitable work, seizing upon every pretext\r\nrequiring his attention, and he was glad when he had for some trivial\r\nreason to be out for the whole day. He had been intending of late\r\nto go abroad, to study night-refuges, and that idea attracted him\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIt was an autumn day. Yulia had just gone to the lodge to cry, while\r\nLaptev lay on a sofa in the study thinking where he could go. Just\r\nat that moment Pyotr announced Polina Razsudin. Laptev was delighted;\r\nhe leapt up and went to meet the unexpected visitor, who had been\r\nhis closest friend, though he had almost begun to forget her. She\r\nhad not changed in the least since that evening when he had seen\r\nher for the last time, and was just the same as ever.\r\n\r\n"Polina," he said, holding out both hands to her. "What ages! If\r\nyou only knew how glad I am to see you! Do come in!"\r\n\r\nPolina greeted him, jerked him by the hand, and without taking off\r\nher coat and hat, went into the study and sat down.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to you for one minute," she said. "I haven\'t time to\r\ntalk of any nonsense. Sit down and listen. Whether you are glad to\r\nsee me or not is absolutely nothing to me, for I don\'t care a straw\r\nfor the gracious attentions of you lords of creation. I\'ve only\r\ncome to you because I\'ve been to five other places already to-day,\r\nand everywhere I was met with a refusal, and it\'s a matter that\r\ncan\'t be put off. Listen," she went on, looking into his face. "Five\r\nstudents of my acquaintance, stupid, unintelligent people, but\r\ncertainly poor, have neglected to pay their fees, and are being\r\nexcluded from the university. Your wealth makes it your duty to go\r\nstraight to the university and pay for them."\r\n\r\n"With pleasure, Polina."\r\n\r\n"Here are their names," she said, giving him a list. "Go this minute;\r\nyou\'ll have plenty of time to enjoy your domestic happiness\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\nAt that moment a rustle was heard through the door that led into\r\nthe drawing-room; probably the dog was scratching itself. Polina\r\nturned crimson and jumped up.\r\n\r\n"Your Dulcinea\'s eavesdropping," she said. "That\'s horrid!"\r\n\r\nLaptev was offended at this insult to Yulia.\r\n\r\n"She\'s not here; she\'s in the lodge," he said. "And don\'t speak of\r\nher like that. Our child is dead, and she is in great distress."\r\n\r\n"You can console her," Polina scoffed, sitting down again; "she\'ll\r\nhave another dozen. You don\'t need much sense to bring children\r\ninto the world."\r\n\r\nLaptev remembered that he had heard this, or something very like\r\nit, many times in old days, and it brought back a whiff of the\r\nromance of the past, of solitary freedom, of his bachelor life,\r\nwhen he was young and thought he could do anything he chose, when\r\nhe had neither love for his wife nor memory of his baby.\r\n\r\n"Let us go together," he said, stretching.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the university Polina waited at the gate, while\r\nLaptev went into the office; he came back soon afterwards and handed\r\nPolina five receipts.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going now?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"To Yartsev\'s."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come with you."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll prevent him from writing."\r\n\r\n"No, I assure you I won\'t," he said, and looked at her imploringly.\r\n\r\nShe had on a black hat trimmed with crape, as though she were in\r\nmourning, and a short, shabby coat, the pockets of which stuck out.\r\nHer nose looked longer than it used to be, and her face looked\r\nbloodless in spite of the cold. Laptev liked walking with her, doing\r\nwhat she told him, and listening to her grumbling. He walked along\r\nthinking about her, what inward strength there must be in this\r\nwoman, since, though she was so ugly, so angular, so restless,\r\nthough she did not know how to dress, and always had untidy hair,\r\nand was always somehow out of harmony, she was yet so fascinating.\r\n\r\nThey went into Yartsev\'s flat by the back way through the kitchen,\r\nwhere they were met by the cook, a clean little old woman with grey\r\ncurls; she was overcome with embarrassment, and with a honeyed smile\r\nwhich made her little face look like a pie, said:\r\n\r\n"Please walk in."\r\n\r\nYartsev was not at home. Polina sat down to the piano, and beginning\r\nupon a tedious, difficult exercise, told Laptev not to hinder her.\r\nAnd without distracting her attention by conversation, he sat on\r\none side and began turning over the pages of a "The Messenger of\r\nEurope." After practising for two hours--it was the task she set\r\nherself every day--she ate something in the kitchen and went out\r\nto her lessons. Laptev read the continuation of a story, then sat\r\nfor a long time without reading and without being bored, glad to\r\nthink that he was too late for dinner at home.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" came Yartsev\'s laugh, and he walked in with ruddy\r\ncheeks, looking strong and healthy, wearing a new coat with bright\r\nbuttons. "Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nThe friends dined together. Then Laptev lay on the sofa while Yartsev\r\nsat near and lighted a cigar. It got dark.\r\n\r\n"I must be getting old," said Laptev. "Ever since my sister Nina\r\ndied, I\'ve taken to constantly thinking of death."\r\n\r\nThey began talking of death, of the immortality of the soul, of how\r\nnice it would be to rise again and fly off somewhere to Mars, to\r\nbe always idle and happy, and, above all, to think in a new special\r\nway, not as on earth.\r\n\r\n"One doesn\'t want to die," said Yartsev softly. "No sort of philosophy\r\ncan reconcile me to death, and I look on it simply as annihilation.\r\nOne wants to live."\r\n\r\n"You love life, Gavrilitch?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I love it."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, I can never understand myself about that. I\'m always\r\nin a gloomy mood or else indifferent. I\'m timid, without self-confidence;\r\nI have a cowardly conscience; I never can adapt myself to life, or\r\nbecome its master. Some people talk nonsense or cheat, and even so\r\nenjoy life, while I consciously do good, and feel nothing but\r\nuneasiness or complete indifference. I explain all that, Gavrilitch,\r\nby my being a slave, the grandson of a serf. Before we plebeians\r\nfight our way into the true path, many of our sort will perish on\r\nthe way."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all quite right, my dear fellow," said Yartsev, and he\r\nsighed. "That only proves once again how rich and varied Russian\r\nlife is. Ah, how rich it is! Do you know, I feel more convinced\r\nevery day that we are on the eve of the greatest triumph, and I\r\nshould like to live to take part in it. Whether you like to believe\r\nit or not, to my thinking a remarkable generation is growing up.\r\nIt gives me great enjoyment to teach the children, especially the\r\ngirls. They are wonderful children!"\r\n\r\nYartsev went to the piano and struck a chord.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a chemist, I think in chemical terms, and I shall die a chemist,"\r\nhe went on. "But I am greedy, and I am afraid of dying unsatisfied;\r\nand chemistry is not enough for me, and I seize upon Russian history,\r\nhistory of art, the science of teaching music. . . . Your wife asked\r\nme in the summer to write an historical play, and now I\'m longing\r\nto write and write. I feel as though I could sit for three days and\r\nthree nights without moving, writing all the time. I am worn out\r\nwith ideas--my brain\'s crowded with them, and I feel as though\r\nthere were a pulse throbbing in my head. I don\'t in the least want\r\nto become anything special, to create something great. I simply\r\nwant to live, to dream, to hope, to be in the midst of everything\r\n. . . . Life is short, my dear fellow, and one must make the most of\r\neverything."\r\n\r\nAfter this friendly talk, which was not over till midnight, Laptev\r\ntook to coming to see Yartsev almost every day. He felt drawn to\r\nhim. As a rule he came towards evening, lay down on the sofa, and\r\nwaited patiently for Yartsev to come in, without feeling in the\r\nleast bored. When Yartsev came back from his work, he had dinner,\r\nand sat down to work; but Laptev would ask him a question, a\r\nconversation would spring up, and there was no more thought of work\r\nand at midnight the friends parted very well pleased with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut this did not last long. Arriving one day at Yartsev\'s, Laptev\r\nfound no one there but Polina, who was sitting at the piano practising\r\nher exercises. She looked at him with a cold, almost hostile\r\nexpression, and asked without shaking hands:\r\n\r\n"Tell me, please: how much longer is this going on?"\r\n\r\n"This? What?" asked Laptev, not understanding.\r\n\r\n"You come here every day and hinder Yartsev from working. Yartsev\r\nis not a tradesman; he is a scientific man, and every moment of his\r\nlife is precious. You ought to understand and to have some little\r\ndelicacy!"\r\n\r\n"If you think that I hinder him," said Laptev, mildly, disconcerted,\r\n"I will give up my visits."\r\n\r\n"Quite right, too. You had better go, or he may be home in a minute\r\nand find you here."\r\n\r\nThe tone in which this was said, and the indifference in Polina\'s\r\neyes, completely disconcerted him. She had absolutely no sort of\r\nfeeling for him now, except the desire that he should go as soon\r\nas possible--and what a contrast it was to her old love for him!\r\nHe went out without shaking hands with her, and he fancied she would\r\ncall out to him, bring him back, but he heard the scales again, and\r\nas he slowly went down the stairs he realised that he had become a\r\nstranger to her now.\r\n\r\nThree days later Yartsev came to spend the evening with him.\r\n\r\n"I have news," he said, laughing. "Polina Nikolaevna has moved into\r\nmy rooms altogether." He was a little confused, and went on in a\r\nlow voice: "Well, we are not in love with each other, of course,\r\nbut I suppose that . . . that doesn\'t matter. I am glad I can give\r\nher a refuge and peace and quiet, and make it possible for her not\r\nto work if she\'s ill. She fancies that her coming to live with me\r\nwill make things more orderly, and that under her influence I shall\r\nbecome a great scientist. That\'s what she fancies. And let her fancy\r\nit. In the South they have a saying: \'Fancy makes the fool a rich\r\nman.\' Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nLaptev said nothing. Yartsev walked up and down the study, looking\r\nat the pictures he had seen so many times before, and said with a\r\nsigh:\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear fellow, I am three years older than you are, and it\'s\r\ntoo late for me to think of real love, and in reality a woman like\r\nPolina Nikolaevna is a godsend to me, and, of course, I shall get\r\non capitally with her till we\'re both old people; but, goodness\r\nknows why, one still regrets something, one still longs for something,\r\nand I still feel as though I am lying in the Vale of Daghestan and\r\ndreaming of a ball. In short, man\'s never satisfied with what he\r\nhas."\r\n\r\nHe went into the drawing-room and began singing as though nothing\r\nhad happened, and Laptev sat in his study with his eyes shut, and\r\ntried to understand why Polina had gone to live with Yartsev. And\r\nthen he felt sad that there were no lasting, permanent attachments.\r\nAnd he felt vexed that Polina Nikolaevna had gone to live with\r\nYartsev, and vexed with himself that his feeling for his wife was\r\nnot what it had been.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nLaptev sat reading and swaying to and fro in a rocking-chair; Yulia\r\nwas in the study, and she, too, was reading. It seemed there was\r\nnothing to talk about; they had both been silent all day. From time\r\nto time he looked at her from over his book and thought: "Whether\r\none marries from passionate love, or without love at all, doesn\'t\r\nit come to the same thing?" And the time when he used to be jealous,\r\ntroubled, distressed, seemed to him far away. He had succeeded in\r\ngoing abroad, and now he was resting after the journey and looking\r\nforward to another visit in the spring to England, which he had\r\nvery much liked.\r\n\r\nAnd Yulia Sergeyevna had grown used to her sorrow, and had left off\r\ngoing to the lodge to cry. That winter she had given up driving out\r\nshopping, had given up the theatres and concerts, and had stayed\r\nat home. She never cared for big rooms, and always sat in her\r\nhusband\'s study or in her own room, where she had shrines of ikons\r\nthat had come to her on her marriage, and where there hung on the\r\nwall the landscape that had pleased her so much at the exhibition.\r\nShe spent hardly any money on herself, and was almost as frugal now\r\nas she had been in her father\'s house.\r\n\r\nThe winter passed cheerlessly. Card-playing was the rule everywhere\r\nin Moscow, and if any other recreation was attempted, such as\r\nsinging, reading, drawing, the result was even more tedious. And\r\nsince there were few talented people in Moscow, and the same singers\r\nand reciters performed at every entertainment, even the enjoyment\r\nof art gradually palled and became for many people a tiresome and\r\nmonotonous social duty.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Laptevs never had a day without something vexatious\r\nhappening. Old Laptev\'s eyesight was failing; he no longer went to\r\nthe warehouse, and the oculist told them that he would soon be\r\nblind. Fyodor had for some reason given up going to the warehouse\r\nand spent his time sitting at home writing something. Panaurov had\r\ngot a post in another town, and had been promoted an actual civil\r\ncouncillor, and was now staying at the Dresden. He came to the\r\nLaptevs\' almost every day to ask for money. Kish had finished his\r\nstudies at last, and while waiting for Laptev to find him a job,\r\nused to spend whole days at a time with them, telling them long,\r\ntedious stories. All this was irritating and exhausting, and made\r\ndaily life unpleasant.\r\n\r\nPyotr came into the study, and announced an unknown lady. On the\r\ncard he brought in was the name "Josephina Iosefovna Milan."\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna got up languidly and went out limping slightly,\r\nas her foot had gone to sleep. In the doorway appeared a pale, thin\r\nlady with dark eyebrows, dressed altogether in black. She clasped\r\nher hands on her bosom and said supplicatingly:\r\n\r\n"M. Laptev, save my children!"\r\n\r\nThe jingle of her bracelets sounded familiar to him, and he knew\r\nthe face with patches of powder on it; he recognised her as the\r\nlady with whom he had once so inappropriately dined before his\r\nmarriage. It was Panaurov\'s second wife.\r\n\r\n"Save my children," she repeated, and her face suddenly quivered\r\nand looked old and pitiful. "You alone can save us, and I have spent\r\nmy last penny coming to Moscow to see you! My children are starving!"\r\n\r\nShe made a motion as though she were going to fall on her knees.\r\nLaptev was alarmed, and clutched her by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, sit down . . ." he muttered, making her sit down. "I beg\r\nyou to be seated."\r\n\r\n"We have no money to buy bread," she said. "Grigory Nikolaevitch\r\nis going away to a new post, but he will not take the children and\r\nme with him, and the money which you so generously send us he spends\r\nonly on himself. What are we to do? What? My poor, unhappy children!"\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself, I beg. I will give orders that that money shall be\r\nmade payable to you."\r\n\r\nShe began sobbing, and then grew calmer, and he noticed that the\r\ntears had made little pathways through the powder on her cheeks,\r\nand that she was growing a moustache.\r\n\r\n"You are infinitely generous, M. Laptev. But be our guardian angel,\r\nour good fairy, persuade Grigory Nikolaevitch not to abandon me,\r\nbut to take me with him. You know I love him--I love him insanely;\r\nhe\'s the comfort of my life."\r\n\r\nLaptev gave her a hundred roubles, and promised to talk to Panaurov,\r\nand saw her out to the hall in trepidation the whole time, for fear\r\nshe should break into sobs or fall on her knees.\r\n\r\nAfter her, Kish made his appearance. Then Kostya came in with his\r\nphotographic apparatus. Of late he had been attracted by photography\r\nand took photographs of every one in the house several times a day.\r\nThis new pursuit caused him many disappointments, and he had actually\r\ngrown thinner.\r\n\r\nBefore evening tea Fyodor arrived. Sitting in a corner in the study,\r\nhe opened a book and stared for a long time at a page, obviously\r\nnot reading. Then he spent a long time drinking tea; his face turned\r\nred. In his presence Laptev felt a load on his heart; even his\r\nsilence was irksome to him.\r\n\r\n"Russia may be congratulated on the appearance of a new author,"\r\nsaid Fyodor. "Joking apart, though, brother, I have turned out a\r\nlittle article--the firstfruits of my pen, so to say--and I\'ve\r\nbrought it to show you. Read it, dear boy, and tell me your opinion\r\n--but sincerely."\r\n\r\nHe took a manuscript out of his pocket and gave it to his brother.\r\nThe article was called "The Russian Soul"; it was written tediously,\r\nin the colourless style in which people with no talent, but full\r\nof secret vanity, usually write. The leading idea of it was that\r\nthe intellectual man has the right to disbelieve in the supernatural,\r\nbut it is his duty to conceal his lack of faith, that he may not\r\nbe a stumbling-block and shake the faith of others. Without faith\r\nthere is no idealism, and idealism is destined to save Europe and\r\nguide humanity into the true path.\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t say what Europe has to be saved from," said Laptev.\r\n\r\n"That\'s intelligible of itself."\r\n\r\n"Nothing is intelligible," said Laptev, and he walked about the\r\nroom in agitation. "It\'s not intelligible to me why you wrote it.\r\nBut that\'s your business."\r\n\r\n"I want to publish it in pamphlet form."\r\n\r\n"That\'s your affair."\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a minute. Fyodor sighed and said:\r\n\r\n"It\'s an immense regret to me, dear brother, that we think differently.\r\nOh, Alyosha, Alyosha, my darling brother! You and I are true Russians,\r\ntrue believers, men of broad nature; all of these German and Jewish\r\ncrochets are not for us. You and I are not wretched upstarts, you\r\nknow, but representatives of a distinguished merchant family."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by a distinguished family?" said Laptev, restraining\r\nhis irritation. "A distinguished family! The landowners beat our\r\ngrandfather and every low little government clerk punched him in\r\nthe face. Our grandfather thrashed our father, and our father\r\nthrashed us. What has your distinguished family done for us? What\r\nsort of nerves, what sort of blood, have we inherited? For nearly\r\nthree years you\'ve been arguing like an ignorant deacon, and talking\r\nall sorts of nonsense, and now you\'ve written--this slavish drivel\r\nhere! While I, while I! Look at me. . . . No elasticity, no boldness,\r\nno strength of will; I tremble over every step I take as though I\r\nshould be flogged for it. I am timid before nonentities, idiots,\r\nbrutes, who are immeasurably my inferiors mentally and morally; I\r\nam afraid of porters, doorkeepers, policemen, gendarmes. I am afraid\r\nof every one, because I was born of a mother who was terrified, and\r\nbecause from a child I was beaten and frightened! . . . You and I\r\nwill do well to have no children. Oh, God, grant that this distinguished\r\nmerchant family may die with us!"\r\n\r\nYulia Sergeyevna came into the study and sat down at the table.\r\n\r\n"Are you arguing about something here?" she asked. "Am I interrupting?"\r\n\r\n"No, little sister," answered Fyodor. "Our discussion was of\r\nprinciples. Here, you are abusing the family," he added, turning\r\nto his brother. "That family has created a business worth a million,\r\nthough. That stands for something, anyway!"\r\n\r\n"A great distinction--a business worth a million! A man with no\r\nparticular brains, without abilities, by chance becomes a trader,\r\nand then when he has grown rich he goes on trading from day to day,\r\nwith no sort of system, with no aim, without having any particular\r\ngreed for money. He trades mechanically, and money comes to him of\r\nitself, without his going to meet it. He sits all his life at his\r\nwork, likes it only because he can domineer over his clerks and get\r\nthe better of his customers. He\'s a churchwarden because he can\r\ndomineer over the choristers and keep them under his thumb; he\'s\r\nthe patron of a school because he likes to feel the teacher is his\r\nsubordinate and enjoys lording it over him. The merchant does not\r\nlove trading, he loves dominating, and your warehouse is not so\r\nmuch a commercial establishment as a torture chamber! And for a\r\nbusiness like yours, you want clerks who have been deprived of\r\nindividual character and personal life--and you make them such\r\nby forcing them in childhood to lick the dust for a crust of bread,\r\nand you\'ve trained them from childhood to believe that you are their\r\nbenefactors. No fear of your taking a university man into your\r\nwarehouse!"\r\n\r\n"University men are not suitable for our business."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true," cried Laptev. "It\'s a lie!"\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, it seems to me you spit into the well from which you\r\ndrink yourself," said Fyodor, and he got up. "Our business is hateful\r\nto you, yet you make use of the income from it."\r\n\r\n"Aha! We\'ve spoken our minds," said Laptev, and he laughed, looking\r\nangrily at his brother. "Yes, if I didn\'t belong to your distinguished\r\nfamily--if I had an ounce of will and courage, I should long ago\r\nhave flung away that income, and have gone to work for my living.\r\nBut in your warehouse you\'ve destroyed all character in me from a\r\nchild! I\'m your product."\r\n\r\nFyodor looked at the clock and began hurriedly saying good-bye. He\r\nkissed Yulia\'s hand and went out, but instead of going into the\r\nhall, walked into the drawing-room, then into the bedroom.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve forgotten how the rooms go," he said in extreme confusion.\r\n"It\'s a strange house. Isn\'t it a strange house!"\r\n\r\nHe seemed utterly overcome as he put on his coat, and there was a\r\nlook of pain on his face. Laptev felt no more anger; he was frightened,\r\nand at the same time felt sorry for Fyodor, and the warm, true love\r\nfor his brother, which seemed to have died down in his heart during\r\nthose three years, awoke, and he felt an intense desire to express\r\nthat love.\r\n\r\n"Come to dinner with us to-morrow, Fyodor," he said, and stroked\r\nhim on the shoulder. "Will you come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; but give me some water."\r\n\r\nLaptev ran himself to the dining-room to take the first thing he\r\ncould get from the sideboard. This was a tall beer-jug. He poured\r\nwater into it and brought it to his brother. Fyodor began drinking,\r\nbut bit a piece out of the jug; they heard a crunch, and then sobs.\r\nThe water ran over his fur coat and his jacket, and Laptev, who had\r\nnever seen men cry, stood in confusion and dismay, not knowing what\r\nto do. He looked on helplessly while Yulia and the servant took off\r\nFyodor\'s coat and helped him back again into the room, and went\r\nwith him, feeling guilty.\r\n\r\nYulia made Fyodor lie down on the sofa and knelt beside him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing," she said, trying to comfort him. "It\'s your\r\nnerves. . . ."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so miserable, my dear!" he said. "I am so unhappy, unhappy\r\n. . . but all the time I\'ve been hiding it, I\'ve been hiding it!"\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her neck and whispered in her ear:\r\n\r\n"Every night I see my sister Nina. She comes and sits in the chair\r\nnear my bed. . . ."\r\n\r\nWhen, an hour later, he put on his fur coat in the hall, he was\r\nsmiling again and ashamed to face the servant. Laptev went with him\r\nto Pyatnitsky Street.\r\n\r\n"Come and have dinner with us to-morrow," he said on the way, holding\r\nhim by the arm, "and at Easter we\'ll go abroad together. You\r\nabsolutely must have a change, or you\'ll be getting quite morbid."\r\n\r\nWhen he got home Laptev found his wife in a state of great nervous\r\nagitation. The scene with Fyodor had upset her, and she could not\r\nrecover her composure. She wasn\'t crying but kept tossing on the\r\nbed, clutching with cold fingers at the quilt, at the pillows, at\r\nher husband\'s hands. Her eyes looked big and frightened.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go away from me, don\'t go away," she said to her husband.\r\n"Tell me, Alyosha, why have I left off saying my prayers? What has\r\nbecome of my faith? Oh, why did you talk of religion before me?\r\nYou\'ve shaken my faith, you and your friends. I never pray now."\r\n\r\nHe put compresses on her forehead, chafed her hands, gave her tea\r\nto drink, while she huddled up to him in terror. . . .\r\n\r\nTowards morning she was worn out and fell asleep, while Laptev sat\r\nbeside her and held her hand. So that he could get no sleep. The\r\nwhole day afterwards he felt shattered and dull, and wandered\r\nlistlessly about the rooms without a thought in his head.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nThe doctor said that Fyodor\'s mind was affected. Laptev did not\r\nknow what to do in his father\'s house, while the dark warehouse in\r\nwhich neither his father nor Fyodor ever appeared now seemed to him\r\nlike a sepulchre. When his wife told him that he absolutely must\r\ngo every day to the warehouse and also to his father\'s, he either\r\nsaid nothing, or began talking irritably of his childhood, saying\r\nthat it was beyond his power to forgive his father for his past,\r\nthat the warehouse and the house in Pyatnitsky Street were hateful\r\nto him, and so on.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning Yulia went herself to Pyatnitsky Street. She\r\nfound old Fyodor Stepanovitch in the same big drawing-room in which\r\nthe service had been held on her first arrival. Wearing slippers,\r\nand without a cravat, he was sitting motionless in his arm-chair,\r\nblinking with his sightless eyes.\r\n\r\n"It\'s I--your daughter-in-law," she said, going up to him. "I\'ve\r\ncome to see how you are."\r\n\r\nHe began breathing heavily with excitement.\r\n\r\nTouched by his affliction and his loneliness, she kissed his hand;\r\nand he passed his hand over her face and head, and having satisfied\r\nhimself that it was she, made the sign of the cross over her.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you," he said. "You know I\'ve lost my eyes and\r\ncan see nothing. . . . I can dimly see the window and the fire, but\r\npeople and things I cannot see at all. Yes, I\'m going blind, and\r\nFyodor has fallen ill, and without the master\'s eye things are in\r\na bad way now. If there is any irregularity there\'s no one to look\r\ninto it; and folks soon get spoiled. And why is it Fyodor has fallen\r\nill? Did he catch cold? Here I have never ailed in my life and never\r\ntaken medicine. I never saw anything of doctors."\r\n\r\nAnd, as he always did, the old man began boasting. Meanwhile the\r\nservants hurriedly laid the table and brought in lunch and bottles\r\nof wine.\r\n\r\nTen bottles were put on the table; one of them was in the shape of\r\nthe Eiffel Tower. There was a whole dish of hot pies smelling of\r\njam, rice, and fish.\r\n\r\n"I beg my dear guest to have lunch," said the old man.\r\n\r\nShe took him by the arm, led him to the table, and poured him out\r\na glass of vodka.\r\n\r\n"I will come to you again to-morrow," she said, "and I\'ll bring\r\nyour grandchildren, Sasha and Lida. They will be sorry for you, and\r\nfondle you."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no need. Don\'t bring them. They are illegitimate."\r\n\r\n"Why are they illegitimate? Why, their father and mother were\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\n"Without my permission. I do not bless them, and I don\'t want to\r\nknow them. Let them be."\r\n\r\n"You speak strangely, Fyodor Stepanovitch," said Yulia, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"It is written in the Gospel: children must fear and honour their\r\nparents."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort. The Gospel tells us that we must forgive even\r\nour enemies."\r\n\r\n"One can\'t forgive in our business. If you were to forgive every\r\none, you would come to ruin in three years."\r\n\r\n"But to forgive, to say a kind, friendly word to any one, even a\r\nsinner, is something far above business, far above wealth."\r\n\r\nYulia longed to soften the old man, to awaken a feeling of compassion\r\nin him, to move him to repentance; but he only listened condescendingly\r\nto all she said, as a grown-up person listens to a child.\r\n\r\n"Fyodor Stepanovitch," said Yulia resolutely, "you are an old man,\r\nand God soon will call you to Himself. He won\'t ask you how you\r\nmanaged your business, and whether you were successful in it, but\r\nwhether you were gracious to people; or whether you were harsh to\r\nthose who were weaker than you, such as your servants, your clerks."\r\n\r\n"I was always the benefactor of those that served me; they ought\r\nto remember me in their prayers forever," said the old man, with\r\nconviction, but touched by Yulia\'s tone of sincerity, and anxious\r\nto give her pleasure, he said: "Very well; bring my grandchildren\r\nto-morrow. I will tell them to buy me some little presents for\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nThe old man was slovenly in his dress, and there was cigar ash on\r\nhis breast and on his knees; apparently no one cleaned his boots,\r\nor brushed his clothes. The rice in the pies was half cooked, the\r\ntablecloth smelt of soap, the servants tramped noisily about the\r\nroom. And the old man and the whole house had a neglected look, and\r\nYulia, who felt this, was ashamed of herself and of her husband.\r\n\r\n"I will be sure to come and see you to-morrow," she said.\r\n\r\nShe walked through the rooms, and gave orders for the old man\'s\r\nbedroom to be set to rights, and the lamp to be lighted under the\r\nikons in it. Fyodor, sitting in his own room, was looking at an\r\nopen book without reading it. Yulia talked to him and told the\r\nservants to tidy his room, too; then she went downstairs to the\r\nclerks. In the middle of the room where the clerks used to dine,\r\nthere was an unpainted wooden post to support the ceiling and to\r\nprevent its coming down. The ceilings in the basement were low, the\r\nwalls covered with cheap paper, and there was a smell of charcoal\r\nfumes and cooking. As it was a holiday, all the clerks were at home,\r\nsitting on their bedsteads waiting for dinner. When Yulia went in\r\nthey jumped up, and answered her questions timidly, looking up at\r\nher from under their brows like convicts.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! What a horrid room you have!" she said, throwing up\r\nher hands. "Aren\'t you crowded here?"\r\n\r\n"Crowded, but not aggrieved," said Makeitchev. "We are greatly\r\nindebted to you, and will offer up our prayers for you to our\r\nHeavenly Father."\r\n\r\n"The congruity of life with the conceit of the personality," said\r\nPotchatkin.\r\n\r\nAnd noticing that Yulia did not understand Potchatkin, Makeitchev\r\nhastened to explain:\r\n\r\n"We are humble people and must live according to our position."\r\n\r\nShe inspected the boys\' quarters, and then the kitchen, made\r\nacquaintance with the housekeeper, and was thoroughly dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nWhen she got home she said to her husband:\r\n\r\n"We ought to move into your father\'s house and settle there for\r\ngood as soon as possible. And you will go every day to the warehouse."\r\n\r\nThen they both sat side by side in the study without speaking. His\r\nheart was heavy, and he did not want to move into Pyatnitsky Street\r\nor to go into the warehouse; but he guessed what his wife was\r\nthinking, and could not oppose her. He stroked her cheek and said:\r\n\r\n"I feel as though our life is already over, and that a grey half-life\r\nis beginning for us. When I knew that my brother Fyodor was hopelessly\r\nill, I shed tears; we spent our childhood and youth together, when\r\nI loved him with my whole soul. And now this catastrophe has come,\r\nand it seems, too, as though, losing him, I am finally cut away\r\nfrom my past. And when you said just now that we must move into the\r\nhouse in Pyatnitsky Street, to that prison, it began to seem to me\r\nthat there was no future for me either."\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked to the window.\r\n\r\n"However that may be, one has to give up all thoughts of happiness,"\r\nhe said, looking out into the street. "There is none. I never have\r\nhad any, and I suppose it doesn\'t exist at all. I was happy once\r\nin my life, though, when I sat at night under your parasol. Do you\r\nremember how you left your parasol at Nina\'s?" he asked, turning\r\nto his wife. "I was in love with you then, and I remember I spent\r\nall night sitting under your parasol, and was perfectly blissful."\r\n\r\nNear the book-case in the study stood a mahogany chest with bronze\r\nfittings where Laptev kept various useless things, including the\r\nparasol. He took it out and handed it to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Here it is."\r\n\r\nYulia looked for a minute at the parasol, recognised it, and smiled\r\nmournfully.\r\n\r\n"I remember," she said. "When you proposed to me you held it in\r\nyour hand." And seeing that he was preparing to go out, she said:\r\n"Please come back early if you can. I am dull without you."\r\n\r\nAnd then she went into her own room, and gazed for a long time at\r\nthe parasol.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nIn spite of the complexity of the business and the immense turnover,\r\nthere were no bookkeepers in the warehouse, and it was impossible\r\nto make anything out of the books kept by the cashier in the office.\r\nEvery day the warehouse was visited by agents, German and English,\r\nwith whom the clerks talked politics and religion. A man of noble\r\nbirth, ruined by drink, an ailing, pitiable creature, used to come\r\nto translate the foreign correspondence in the office; the clerks\r\nused to call him a midge, and put salt in his tea. And altogether\r\nthe whole concern struck Laptev as a very queer business.\r\n\r\nHe went to the warehouse every day and tried to establish a new\r\norder of things; he forbade them to thrash the boys and to jeer at\r\nthe buyers, and was violently angry when the clerks gleefully\r\ndespatched to the provinces worthless shop-soiled goods as though\r\nthey were new and fashionable. Now he was the chief person in the\r\nwarehouse, but still, as before, he did not know how large his\r\nfortune was, whether his business was doing well, how much the\r\nsenior clerks were paid, and so on. Potchatkin and Makeitchev looked\r\nupon him as young and inexperienced, concealed a great deal from\r\nhim, and whispered mysteriously every evening with his blind old\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nIt somehow happened at the beginning of June that Laptev went into\r\nthe Bubnovsky restaurant with Potchatkin to talk business with him\r\nover lunch. Potchatkin had been with the Laptevs a long while, and\r\nhad entered their service at eight years old. He seemed to belong\r\nto them--they trusted him fully; and when on leaving the warehouse\r\nhe gathered up all the takings from the till and thrust them into\r\nhis pocket, it never aroused the slightest suspicion. He was the\r\nhead man in the business and in the house, and also in the church,\r\nwhere he performed the duties of churchwarden in place of his old\r\nmaster. He was nicknamed Malyuta Skuratov on account of his cruel\r\ntreatment of the boys and clerks under him.\r\n\r\nWhen they went into the restaurant he nodded to a waiter and said:\r\n\r\n"Bring us, my lad, half a bodkin and twenty-four unsavouries."\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause the waiter brought on a tray half a bottle of\r\nvodka and some plates of various kinds of savouries.\r\n\r\n"Look here, my good fellow," said Potchatkin. "Give us a plateful\r\nof the source of all slander and evil-speaking, with mashed potatoes."\r\n\r\nThe waiter did not understand; he was puzzled, and would have said\r\nsomething, but Potchatkin looked at him sternly and said:\r\n\r\n"Except."\r\n\r\nThe waiter thought intently, then went to consult with his colleagues,\r\nand in the end guessing what was meant, brought a plateful of tongue.\r\nWhen they had drunk a couple of glasses and had had lunch, Laptev\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Ivan Vassilitch, is it true that our business has been\r\ndropping off for the last year?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it."\r\n\r\n"Tell me frankly and honestly what income we have been making and\r\nare making, and what our profits are. We can\'t go on in the dark.\r\nWe had a balancing of the accounts at the warehouse lately, but,\r\nexcuse me, I don\'t believe in it; you think fit to conceal something\r\nfrom me and only tell the truth to my father. You have been used\r\nto being diplomatic from your childhood, and now you can\'t get on\r\nwithout it. And what\'s the use of it? So I beg you to be open. What\r\nis our position?"\r\n\r\n"It all depends upon the fluctuation of credit," Potchatkin answered\r\nafter a moment\'s pause.\r\n\r\n"What do you understand by the fluctuation of credit?"\r\n\r\nPotchatkin began explaining, but Laptev could make nothing of it,\r\nand sent for Makeitchev. The latter promptly made his appearance,\r\nhad some lunch after saying grace, and in his sedate, mellow baritone\r\nbegan saying first of all that the clerks were in duty bound to\r\npray night and day for their benefactors.\r\n\r\n"By all means, only allow me not to consider myself your benefactor,"\r\nsaid Laptev.\r\n\r\n"Every man ought to remember what he is, and to be conscious of his\r\nstation. By the grace of God you are a father and benefactor to us,\r\nand we are your slaves."\r\n\r\n"I am sick of all that!" said Laptev, getting angry. "Please be a\r\nbenefactor to me now. Please explain the position of our business.\r\nGive up looking upon me as a boy, or to-morrow I shall close the\r\nbusiness. My father is blind, my brother is in the asylum, my nieces\r\nare only children. I hate the business; I should be glad to go away,\r\nbut there\'s no one to take my place, as you know. For goodness\'\r\nsake, drop your diplomacy!"\r\n\r\nThey went to the warehouse to go into the accounts; then they went\r\non with them at home in the evening, the old father himself assisting.\r\nInitiating his son into his commercial secrets, the old man spoke\r\nas though he were engaged, not in trade, but in sorcery. It appeared\r\nthat the profits of the business were increasing approximately ten\r\nper cent. per annum, and that the Laptevs\' fortune, reckoning only\r\nmoney and paper securities, amounted to six million roubles.\r\n\r\nWhen at one o\'clock at night, after balancing the accounts, Laptev\r\nwent out into the open air, he was still under the spell of those\r\nfigures. It was a still, sultry, moonlight night. The white walls\r\nof the houses beyond the river, the heavy barred gates, the stillness\r\nand the black shadows, combined to give the impression of a fortress,\r\nand nothing was wanting to complete the picture but a sentinel with\r\na gun. Laptev went into the garden and sat down on a seat near the\r\nfence, which divided them from the neighbour\'s yard, where there\r\nwas a garden, too. The bird-cherry was in bloom. Laptev remembered\r\nthat the tree had been just as gnarled and just as big when he was\r\na child, and had not changed at all since then. Every corner of the\r\ngarden and of the yard recalled the far-away past. And in his\r\nchildhood, too, just as now, the whole yard bathed in moonlight\r\ncould be seen through the sparse trees, the shadows had been\r\nmysterious and forbidding, a black dog had lain in the middle of\r\nthe yard, and the clerks\' windows had stood wide open. And all these\r\nwere cheerless memories.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the fence, in the neighbour\'s yard, there was a\r\nsound of light steps.\r\n\r\n"My sweet, my precious . . ." said a man\'s voice so near the fence\r\nthat Laptev could hear the man\'s breathing.\r\n\r\nNow they were kissing. Laptev was convinced that the millions and\r\nthe business which was so distasteful to him were ruining his life,\r\nand would make him a complete slave. He imagined how, little by\r\nlittle, he would grow accustomed to his position; would, little by\r\nlittle, enter into the part of the head of a great firm; would begin\r\nto grow dull and old, die in the end, as the average man usually\r\ndoes die, in a decrepit, soured old age, making every one about him\r\nmiserable and depressed. But what hindered him from giving up those\r\nmillions and that business, and leaving that yard and garden which\r\nhad been hateful to him from his childhood?\r\n\r\nThe whispering and kisses the other side of the fence disturbed\r\nhim. He moved into the middle of the yard, and, unbuttoning his\r\nshirt over his chest, looked at the moon, and it seemed to him that\r\nhe would order the gate to be unlocked, and would go out and never\r\ncome back again. His heart ached sweetly with the foretaste of\r\nfreedom; he laughed joyously, and pictured how exquisite, poetical,\r\nand even holy, life might be. . . .\r\n\r\nBut he still stood and did not go away, and kept asking himself:\r\n"What keeps me here?" And he felt angry with himself and with the\r\nblack dog, which still lay stretched on the stone yard, instead of\r\nrunning off to the open country, to the woods, where it would have\r\nbeen free and happy. It was clear that that dog and he were prevented\r\nfrom leaving the yard by the same thing; the habit of bondage, of\r\nservitude. . . .\r\n\r\nAt midday next morning he went to see his wife, and that he might\r\nnot be dull, asked Yartsev to go with him. Yulia Sergeyevna was\r\nstaying in a summer villa at Butovo, and he had not been to see her\r\nfor five days. When they reached the station the friends got into\r\na carriage, and all the way there Yartsev was singing and in raptures\r\nover the exquisite weather. The villa was in a great park not far\r\nfrom the station. At the beginning of an avenue, about twenty paces\r\nfrom the gates, Yulia Sergeyevna was sitting under a broad, spreading\r\npoplar, waiting for her guests. She had on a light, elegant dress\r\nof a pale cream colour trimmed with lace, and in her hand she had\r\nthe old familiar parasol. Yartsev greeted her and went on to the\r\nvilla from which came the sound of Sasha\'s and Lida\'s voices, while\r\nLaptev sat down beside her to talk of business matters.\r\n\r\n"Why is it you haven\'t been for so long?" she said, keeping his\r\nhand in hers. "I have been sitting here for days watching for you\r\nto come. I miss you so when you are away!"\r\n\r\nShe stood up and passed her hand over his hair, and scanned his\r\nface, his shoulders, his hat, with interest.\r\n\r\n"You know I love you," she said, and flushed crimson. "You are\r\nprecious to me. Here you\'ve come. I see you, and I\'m so happy I\r\ncan\'t tell you. Well, let us talk. Tell me something."\r\n\r\nShe had told him she loved him, and he could only feel as though\r\nhe had been married to her for ten years, and that he was hungry\r\nfor his lunch. She had put her arm round his neck, tickling his\r\ncheek with the silk of her dress; he cautiously removed her hand,\r\nstood up, and without uttering a single word, walked to the villa.\r\nThe little girls ran to meet him.\r\n\r\n"How they have grown!" he thought. "And what changes in these three\r\nyears. . . . But one may have to live another thirteen years, another\r\nthirty years. . . . What is there in store for us in the future?\r\nIf we live, we shall see."\r\n\r\nHe embraced Sasha and Lida, who hung upon his neck, and said:\r\n\r\n"Grandpapa sends his love. . . . Uncle Fyodor is dying. Uncle Kostya\r\nhas sent a letter from America and sends you his love in it. He\'s\r\nbored at the exhibition and will soon be back. And Uncle Alyosha\r\nis hungry."\r\n\r\nThen he sat on the verandah and saw his wife walking slowly along\r\nthe avenue towards the house. She was deep in thought; there was a\r\nmournful, charming expression in her face, and her eyes were bright\r\nwith tears. She was not now the slender, fragile, pale-faced girl\r\nshe used to be; she was a mature, beautiful, vigorous woman. And\r\nLaptev saw the enthusiasm with which Yartsev looked at her when he\r\nmet her, and the way her new, lovely expression was reflected in\r\nhis face, which looked mournful and ecstatic too. One would have\r\nthought that he was seeing her for the first time in his life. And\r\nwhile they were at lunch on the verandah, Yartsev smiled with a\r\nsort of joyous shyness, and kept gazing at Yulia and at her beautiful\r\nneck. Laptev could not help watching them while he thought that he\r\nhad perhaps another thirteen, another thirty years of life before\r\nhim. . . . And what would he have to live through in that time?\r\nWhat is in store for us in the future?\r\n\r\nAnd he thought:\r\n\r\n"Let us live, and we shall see."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Darling and Other Stories, by Anton Chekhov\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DARLING AND OTHER STORIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 13416-8.txt or 13416-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/4/1/13416/\r\n\r\nProduced by James Rusk.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
