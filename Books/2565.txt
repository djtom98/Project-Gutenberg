And Oh! but the time presses."\r\n\r\nSpake the sad and sorry carle: "We seek the Land where the days are many:\r\nso many that he who hath forgotten how to laugh, may learn the craft\r\nagain, and forget the days of Sorrow."\r\n\r\nThen they all three cried aloud and said:\r\n\r\n"Is this the Land?  Is this the Land?"\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe wondered, and he laughed and said: "Wayfarers, look under\r\nthe sun down the plain which lieth betwixt the mountains and the sea, and\r\nye shall behold the meadows all gleaming with the spring lilies; yet do\r\nwe not call this the Glittering Plain, but Cleveland by the Sea.  Here\r\nmen die when their hour comes, nor know I if the days of their life be\r\nlong enough for the forgetting of sorrow; for I am young and not yet a\r\nyokefellow of sorrow; but this I know, that they are long enough for the\r\ndoing of deeds that shall not die.  And as for Lord, I know not this\r\nword, for here dwell we, the sons of the Raven, in good fellowship, with\r\nour wives that we have wedded, and our mothers who have borne us, and our\r\nsisters who serve us.  Again I bid you light down off your horses, and\r\neat and drink, and be merry; and depart when ye will, to seek what land\r\nye will."\r\n\r\nThey scarce looked on him, but cried out together mournfully:\r\n\r\n"This is not the Land!  This is not the Land!"\r\n\r\nNo more than that they said, but turned about their horses and rode out\r\nthrough the garth gate, and went clattering up the road that led to the\r\npass of the mountains.  But Hallblithe hearkened wondering, till the\r\nsound of their horse-hoofs died away, and then turned back to his work:\r\nand it was then two hours after high-noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: EVIL TIDINGS COME TO HAND AT CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long had he worked ere he heard the sound of horsehoofs once more,\r\nand he looked not up, but said to himself, "It is but the lads bringing\r\nback the teams from the acres, and riding fast and driving hard for joy\r\nof heart and in wantonness of youth."\r\n\r\nBut the sound grew nearer and he looked up and saw over the turf wall of\r\nthe garth the flutter of white raiment; and he said:\r\n\r\n"Nay, it is the maidens coming back from the sea-shore and the gathering\r\nof wrack."\r\n\r\nSo he set himself the harder to his work, and laughed, all alone as he\r\nwas, and said: "She is with them: now I will not look up again till they\r\nhave ridden into the garth, and she has come from among them, and leapt\r\noff her horse, and cast her arms about my neck as her wont is; and it\r\nwill rejoice her then to mock me with hard words and kind voice and\r\nlonging heart; and I shall long for her and kiss her, and sweet shall the\r\ncoming days seem to us: and the daughters of our folk shall look on and\r\nbe kind and blithe with us."\r\n\r\nTherewith rode the maidens into the garth, but he heard no sound of\r\nlaughter or merriment amongst them, which was contrary to their wont; and\r\nhis heart fell, and it was as if instead of the maidens\' laughter the\r\nvoices of those wayfarers came back upon the wind crying out, "Is this\r\nthe Land?  Is this the Land?"\r\n\r\nThen he looked up hastily, and saw the maidens drawing near, ten of the\r\nHouse of the Raven, and three of the House of the Rose; and he beheld\r\nthem that their faces were pale and woe-begone, and their raiment rent,\r\nand there was no joy in them.  Hallblithe stood aghast while one who had\r\ngotten off her horse (and she was the daughter of his own mother) ran\r\npast him into the hall, looking not at him, as if she durst not: and\r\nanother rode off swiftly to the horse-stalls.  But the others, leaving\r\ntheir horses, drew round about him, and for a while none durst utter a\r\nword; and he stood gazing at them, with the spoke-shave in his hand, he\r\nalso silent; for he saw that the Hostage was not with them, and he knew\r\nthat now he was the yokefellow of sorrow.\r\n\r\nAt last he spoke gently and in a kind voice, and said: "Tell me, sisters,\r\nwhat evil hath befallen us, even if it be the death of a dear friend, and\r\nthe thing that may not be amended."\r\n\r\nThen spoke a fair woman of the Rose, whose name was Brightling, and said:\r\n"Hallblithe, it is not of death that we have to tell, but of sundering,\r\nwhich may yet be amended.  We were on the sand of the sea nigh the Ship-\r\nstead and the Rollers of the Raven, and we were gathering the wrack and\r\nplaying together; and we saw a round-ship nigh to shore lying with her\r\nsheet slack, and her sail beating the mast; but we deemed it to be none\r\nother than some bark of the Fish-biters, and thought no harm thereof, but\r\nwent on running and playing amidst the little waves that fell on the\r\nsand, and the ripples that curled around our feet.  At last there came a\r\nsmall boat from the side of the round-ship, and rowed in toward shore,\r\nand still we feared not, though we drew a little aback from the surf and\r\nlet fall our gown-hems.  But the crew of that boat beached her close to\r\nwhere we stood, and came hastily wading the surf towards us; and we saw\r\nthat they were twelve weaponed men, great, and grim, and all clad in\r\nblack raiment.  Then indeed were we afraid, and we turned about and fled\r\nup the beach; but now it was too late, for the tide was at more than half\r\nebb and long was the way over the sand to the place where we had left our\r\nhorses tied among the tamarisk-bushes.  Nevertheless we ran, and had\r\ngotten up to the pebble-beach before they ran in amongst us: and they\r\ncaught us, and cast us down on to the hard stones.\r\n\r\n"Then they made us sit in a row on a ridge of the pebbles; and we were\r\nsore afraid, yet more for defilement at their hands than for death; for\r\nthey were evil-looking men exceeding foul of favour.  Then said one of\r\nthem: \'Which of all you maidens is the Hostage of the House of the Rose?\'\r\n\r\n"Then all we kept silence, for we would not betray her.  But the evil man\r\nspake again: \'Choose ye then whether we shall take one, or all of you\r\nacross the waters in our black ship.\'  Yet still we others spake not,\r\ntill arose thy beloved, O Hallblithe, and said:\r\n\r\n"\'Let it be one then, and not all; for I am the Hostage.\'\r\n\r\n"\'How shalt thou make us sure thereof?\' said the evil carle.\r\n\r\n"She looked on him proudly and said: \'Because I say it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Wilt thou swear it?\' said he.\r\n\r\n"\'Yea,\' said she, \'I swear it by the token of the House wherein I shall\r\nwed; by the wings of the Fowl that seeketh the Field of Slaying.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It is enough,\' said the man, \'come thou with us.  And ye maidens sit ye\r\nthere, and move not till we have made way on our ship, unless ye would\r\nfeel the point of the arrow.  For ye are within bowshot of the ship, and\r\nwe have shot weapons aboard.\'\r\n\r\n"So the Hostage departed with them, and she unweeping, but we wept\r\nsorely.  And we saw the small boat come up to the side of the round-ship,\r\nand the Hostage going over the gunwale along with those evil men, and we\r\nheard the hale and how of the mariners as they drew up the anchor and\r\nsheeted home; and then the sweeps came out and the ship began to move\r\nover the sea.  And one of those evil-minded men bent his bow and shot a\r\nshaft at us, but it fell far short of where we sat, and the laugh of\r\nthose runagates came over the sands to us.  So we crept up the beach\r\ntrembling, and then rose to our feet and got to our horses, and rode\r\nhither speedily, and our hearts are broken for thy sorrow."\r\n\r\nAt that word came Hallblithe\'s own sister out from the hall; and she bore\r\nweapons with her, to wit Hallblithe\'s sword and shield and helm and\r\nhauberk.  As for him he turned back silently to his work, and set the\r\nsteel of the spear on the new ashen shaft, and took the hammer and smote\r\nthe nail in, and laid the weapon on a round pebble that was thereby, and\r\nclenched the nail on the other side.  Then he looked about, and saw that\r\nthe other damsel had brought him his coal-black war-horse ready saddled\r\nand bridled; then he did on his armour, and girt his sword to his side\r\nand leapt into the saddle, and took his new-shafted spear in hand and\r\nshook the rein.  But none of all those damsels durst say a word to him or\r\nask him whither he went, for they feared his face, and the sorrow of his\r\nheart.  So he got him out of the garth and turned toward the sea-shore,\r\nand they saw the glitter of his spear-point a minute over the turf-wall,\r\nand heard the clatter of his horse-hoofs as he galloped over the hard\r\nway; and thus he departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: THE WARRIORS OF THE RAVEN SEARCH THE SEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the women bethought them, and they spake a word or two together, and\r\nthen they sundered and went one this way and one that, to gather together\r\nthe warriors of the Raven who were a-field, or on the way, nigh unto the\r\nhouse, that they might follow Hallblithe down to the sea-shore and help\r\nhim; after a while they came back again by one and two and three,\r\nbringing with them the wrathful young men; and when there was upward of a\r\nscore gathered in the garth armed and horsed, they rode their ways to the\r\nsea, being minded to thrust a long-ship of the Ravens out over the\r\nRollers into the sea, and follow the strong-thieves of the waters and\r\nbring a-back the Hostage, so that they might end the sorrow at once, and\r\nestablish joy once more in the House of the Raven and the House of the\r\nRose.  But they had with them three lads of fifteen winters or\r\nthereabouts to lead their horses back home again, when they should have\r\ngone up on to the Horse of the Brine.\r\n\r\nThus then they departed, and the maidens stood in the garth-gate till\r\nthey lost sight of them behind the sandhills, and then turned back\r\nsorrowfully into the house, and sat there talking low of their sorrow.\r\nAnd many a time they had to tell their tale anew, as folk came into the\r\nhall one after another from field and fell.  But the young men came down\r\nto the sea, and found Hallblithe\'s black horse straying about amongst the\r\ntamarisk-bushes above the beach; and they looked thence over the sand,\r\nand saw neither Hallblithe nor any man: and they gazed out seaward, and\r\nsaw neither ship nor sail on the barren brine.  Then they went down on to\r\nthe sand, and sundered their fellowship, and went half one way, half the\r\nother, betwixt the sandhills and the surf, where now the tide was\r\nflowing, till the nesses of the east and the west, the horns of the bay,\r\nstayed them.  Then they met together again by the Rollers, when the sun\r\nwas within an hour of setting.  There and then they laid hand to that\r\nship which is called the Seamew, and they ran her down over the Rollers\r\ninto the waves, and leapt aboard and hoisted sail, and ran out the oars\r\nand put to sea; and a little wind was blowing seaward from the gates of\r\nthe mountains behind them.\r\n\r\nSo they quartered the sea-plain, as the kestrel doth the water-meadows,\r\ntill the night fell on them, and was cloudy, though whiles the wading\r\nmoon shone out; and they had seen nothing, neither sail nor ship, nor\r\naught else on the barren brine, save the washing of waves and the\r\nhovering of sea-fowl.  So they lay-to outside the horns of the bay and\r\nawaited the dawning.  And when morning was come they made way again, and\r\nsearched the sea, and sailed to the out-skerries, and searched them with\r\ncare; then they sailed into the main and fared hither and thither and up\r\nand down: and this they did for eight days, and in all that time they saw\r\nno ship nor sail, save three barks of the Fish-biters nigh to the Skerry\r\nwhich is called Mew-stone.\r\n\r\nSo they fared home to the Raven Bay, and laid their keel on the Rollers,\r\nand so went their ways sadly, home to the House of the Raven: and they\r\ndeemed that for this time they could do no more in seeking their valiant\r\nkinsman and his fair damsel.  And they were very sorry; for these two\r\nwere well-beloved of all men.  But since they might not amend it, they\r\nabode in peace, awaiting what the change of days might bring them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: NOW HALLBLITHE TAKETH THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nNow must it be told of Hallblithe that he rode fiercely down to the sea-\r\nshore, and from the top of the beach he gazed about him, and there below\r\nhim was the Ship-stead and Rollers of his kindred, whereon lay the three\r\nlong-ships, the Seamew, and the Osprey and the Erne.  Heavy and huge they\r\nseemed to him as they lay there, black-sided, icy-cold with the washing\r\nof the March waves, their golden dragon-heads looking seaward wistfully.\r\nBut first had he looked out into the offing, and it was only when he had\r\nlet his eyes come back from where the sea and sky met, and they had\r\nbeheld nothing but the waste of waters, that he beheld the Ship-stead\r\nclosely; and therewith he saw where a little to the west of it lay a\r\nskiff, which the low wave of the tide lifted and let fall from time to\r\ntime.  It had a mast, and a black sail hoisted thereon and flapping with\r\nslackened sheet.  A man sat in the boat clad in black raiment, and the\r\nsun smote a gleam from the helm on his head.  Then Hallblithe leapt off\r\nhis horse, and strode down the sands shouldering his spear; and when he\r\ncame near to the man in the boat he poised his spear and shook it and\r\ncried out: "Man, art thou friend or foe?"\r\n\r\nSaid the man: "Thou art a fair young man: but there is grief in thy voice\r\nalong with wrath.  Cast not till thou hast heard me, and mayst deem\r\nwhether I may do aught to heal thy grief."\r\n\r\n"What mayst thou do?" said Hallblithe; "art thou not a robber of the sea,\r\na harrier of the folks that dwell in peace?"\r\n\r\nThe man laughed: "Yea," said he, "my craft is thieving and carrying off\r\nthe daughters of folk, so that we may have a ransom for them.  Wilt thou\r\ncome over the waters with me?"\r\n\r\nHallblithe said wrathfully:\r\n\r\n"Nay, rather, come thou ashore here!  Thou seemest a big man, and belike\r\nshall be good of thine hands.  Come and fight with me; and then he of us\r\nwho is vanquished, if he be unslain, shall serve the other for a year,\r\nand then shalt thou do my business in the ransoming."\r\n\r\nThe man in the boat laughed again, and that so scornfully that he angered\r\nHallblithe beyond measure: then he arose in the boat and stood on his\r\nfeet swaying from side to side as he laughed.  He was passing big, long-\r\narmed and big-headed, and long hair came from under his helm like the\r\ntail of a red horse; his eyes were grey and gleaming, and his mouth wide.\r\n\r\nIn a while he stayed his laughter and said: "O Warrior of the Raven, this\r\nwere a simple game for thee to play; though it is not far from my mind,\r\nfor fighting when I needs must win is no dull work.  Look you, if I slay\r\nor vanquish thee, then all is said; and if by some chance stroke thou\r\nslayest me, then is thine only helper in this matter gone from thee.  Now\r\nto be short, I bid thee come aboard to me if thou wouldst ever hear\r\nanother word of thy damsel betrothed.  And moreover this need not hinder\r\nthee to fight with me if thou hast a mind to it thereafter; for we shall\r\nsoon come to a land big enough for two to stand on.  Or if thou listest\r\nto fight in a boat rocking on the waves, I see not but there may be\r\nmanhood in that also."\r\n\r\nNow was the hot wrath somewhat run off Hallblithe, nor durst he lose any\r\nchance to hear a word of his beloved; so he said: "Big man, I will come\r\naboard.  But look thou to it, if thou hast a mind to bewray me; for the\r\nsons of the Raven die hard."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the big man, "I have heard that their minstrels are of many\r\nwords, and think that they have tales to tell.  Come aboard and loiter\r\nnot."  Then Hallblithe waded the surf and lightly strode over the gunwale\r\nof the skiff and sat him down.  The big man thrust out into the deep and\r\nhaled home the sheet; but there was but little wind.\r\n\r\nThen said Hallblithe: "Wilt thou have me row, for I wot not whitherward\r\nto steer?"\r\n\r\nSaid the red carle: "Maybe thou art not in a hurry; I am not: do as thou\r\nwilt."  So Hallblithe took the oars and rowed mightily, while the alien\r\nsteered, and they went swiftly and lightly over the sea, and the waves\r\nwere little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: THEY COME UNTO THE ISLE OF RANSOM\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the sun grew low, and it set; the stars and the moon shone a while and\r\nthen it clouded over.  Hallblithe still rowed and rested not, though he\r\nwas weary; and the big man sat and steered, and held his peace.  But when\r\nthe night was grown old and it was not far from the dawn, the alien said:\r\n"Youngling of the Ravens, now shalt thou sleep and I will row."\r\n\r\nHallblithe was exceeding weary; so he gave the oars to the alien and lay\r\ndown in the stern and slept.  And in his sleep he dreamed that he was\r\nlying in the House of the Raven, and his sisters came to him and said,\r\n"Rise up now, Hallblithe! wilt thou be a sluggard on the day of thy\r\nwedding?  Come thou with us to the House of the Rose that we may bear\r\naway the Hostage."  Then he dreamed that they departed, and he arose and\r\nclad himself: but when he would have gone out of the hall, then was it no\r\nlonger daylight, but moonlight, and he dreamed that he had dreamed:\r\nnevertheless he would have gone abroad, but might not find the door; so\r\nhe said he would go out by a window; but the wall was high and smooth\r\n(quite other than in the House of the Raven, where were low windows all\r\nalong one aisle), nor was there any way to come at them.  But he dreamed\r\nthat he was so abashed thereat, and had such a weakness on him, that he\r\nwept for pity of himself: and he went to his bed to lie down; and lo!\r\nthere was no bed and no hall; nought but a heath, wild and wide, and\r\nempty under the moon.  And still he wept in his dream, and his manhood\r\nseemed departed from him, and he heard a voice crying out, "Is this the\r\nLand?  Is this the Land?"\r\n\r\nTherewithal he awoke, and as his eyes cleared he beheld the big man\r\nrowing and the black sail flapping against the mast; for the wind had\r\nfallen dead and they were faring on over a long smooth swell of the sea.\r\nIt was broad daylight, but round about them was a thick mist, which\r\nseemed none the less as if the sun were ready to shine through it.\r\n\r\nAs Hallblithe caught the red man\'s eye, he smiled and nodded on him and\r\nsaid: "Now has the time come for thee first to eat and then to row.  But\r\ntell me what is that upon thy cheeks?"\r\n\r\nHallblithe, reddening somewhat, said: "The night dew hath fallen on me."\r\n\r\nQuoth the sea-rover, "It is no shame for thee a youngling to remember thy\r\nbetrothed in thy sleep, and to weep because thou lackest her.  But now\r\nbestir thee, for it is later than thou mayest deem."\r\n\r\nTherewith the big man drew in the oars and came to the afterpart of the\r\nboat, and drew meat and drink out of a locker thereby; and they ate and\r\ndrank together, and Hallblithe grew strong and somewhat less downcast;\r\nand he went forward and gat the oars into his hands.\r\n\r\nThen the big red man stood up and looked over his left shoulder and said:\r\n"Soon shall we have a breeze and bright weather."\r\n\r\nThen he looked into the midmost of the sail and fell a-whistling such a\r\ntune as the fiddles play to dancing men and maids at Yule-tide, and his\r\neyes gleamed and glittered therewithal, and exceeding big he looked.  Then\r\nHallblithe felt a little air on his cheek, and the mist grew thinner, and\r\nthe sail began to fill with wind till the sheet tightened: then, lo! the\r\nmist rising from the face of the sea, and the sea\'s face rippling gaily\r\nunder a bright sun.  Then the wind increased, and the wall of mist\r\ndeparted and a few light clouds sped over the sky, and the sail swelled\r\nand the boat heeled over, and the seas fell white from the prow, and they\r\nsped fast over the face of the waters.\r\n\r\nThen laughed the red-haired man, and said: "O croaker on the dead branch,\r\nnow is the wind such that no rowing of thine may catch up with it: so in\r\nwith the oars now, and turn about, and thou shalt see whitherward we are\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe turned about on the thwart and looked across the sea, and\r\nlo! before them the high cliffs and crags and mountains of a new land\r\nwhich seemed to be an isle, and they were deep blue under the sun, which\r\nnow shone aloft in the mid heaven.  He said nought at all, but sat\r\nlooking and wondering what land it might be; but the big man said: "O\r\ntomb of warriors, is it not as if the blueness of the deep sea had heaved\r\nitself up aloft, and turned from coloured air into rock and stone, so\r\nwondrous blue it is?  But that is because those crags and mountains are\r\nso far away, and as we draw nigher to them, thou shalt see them as they\r\nverily are, that they are coal-black; and yonder land is an isle, and is\r\ncalled the Isle of Ransom.  Therein shall be the market for thee where\r\nthou mayst cheapen thy betrothed.  There mayst thou take her by the hand\r\nand lead her away thence, when thou hast dealt with the chapman of\r\nmaidens and hast pledged thee by the fowl of battle, and the edge of the\r\nfallow blade to pay that which he will have of thee."\r\n\r\nAs the big man spoke there was a mocking in his voice and his face and in\r\nhis whole huge body, which made the sword of Hallblithe uneasy in his\r\nscabbard; but he refrained his wrath, and said: "Big man, the longer I\r\nlook, the less I can think how we are to come up on to yonder island; for\r\nI can see nought but a huge cliff, and great mountains rising beyond it."\r\n\r\n"Thou shalt the more wonder," said the alien, "the nigher thou drawest\r\nthereto; for it is not because we are far away that thou canst see no\r\nbeach or strand, or sloping of the land seaward, but because there is\r\nnought of all these things.  Yet fear not! am I not with thee? thou shalt\r\ncome ashore on the Isle of Ransom."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe held his peace, and the other spake not for a while, but\r\ngave a short laugh once or twice; and said at last in a big voice,\r\n"Little Carrion-biter, why dost thou not ask me of my name?"\r\n\r\nNow Hallblithe was a tall man and a fell fighter; but he said: "Because I\r\nwas thinking of other things and not of thee."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the big man, in a voice still louder, "when I am at home men\r\ncall me the Puny Fox."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe said: "Art thou a Fox?  It may well be that thou shalt\r\nbeguile me as such beasts will but look to it, that if thou dost I shall\r\nknow how to avenge me."\r\n\r\nThen rose up the big man from the helm, and straddled wide in the boat,\r\nand cried out in a great roaring voice: "Crag-nester, I am one of seven\r\nbrethren, and the smallest and weakest of them.  Art thou not afraid?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Hallblithe, "for the six others are not here.  Wilt thou fight\r\nhere in boat, O Fox?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Fox, "rather we will drink a cup of wine together."\r\n\r\nSo he opened the locker again and drew out thence a great horn of some\r\nhuge neat of the outlands, which was girthed and stopped with silver, and\r\nalso a golden cup, and he filled the cup from the horn and gave it into\r\nHallblithe\'s hand and said: "Drink, O black-fledged nestling!  But call a\r\nhealth over the cup if thou wilt."  So Hallblithe raised the cup aloft\r\nand cried: "Health to the House of the Raven and to them that love it! an\r\nill day to its foemen!"  Then he set his lips to the cup and drank; and\r\nthat wine seemed to him better and stronger than any he had ever tasted.\r\nBut when he had given the cup back again to Fox, that red one filled it\r\nagain, and cried over it, "The Treasure of the Sea! and the King that\r\ndieth not!"  Then he drank, and filled again for Hallblithe, and steered\r\nwith his knees meanwhile; and thus they drank three cups each, and Fox\r\nsmiled and was peaceful and said but little, but Hallblithe sat wondering\r\nhow the world was changed for him since yesterday.\r\n\r\nBut now was the sky blown all clear of clouds and the wind piped shrill\r\nbehind them, and the great waves rose and fell about them, and the sun\r\nglittered on them in many colours.  Fast flew the boat before the wind as\r\nthough it would never stop, and the day was waning, and the wind still\r\nrising; and now the Isle of Ransom uphove huge before them, and\r\ncoal-black, and no beach and no haven was to be seen therein; and still\r\nthey ran before the wind towards that black cliff-wall, against which the\r\nsea washed for ever, and no keel ever built by man might live for one\r\nmoment \'twixt the surf and the cliff of that grim land.  The sun grew\r\nlow, and sank red under the sea, and that world of stone swallowed up\r\nhalf the heavens before them, for they were now come very nigh thereto;\r\nnor could Hallblithe see aught for it, but that they must be dashed\r\nagainst the cliff and perish in a moment of time.\r\n\r\nStill the boat flew on; but now when the twilight was come, and they had\r\njust opened up along reach of the cliff that lay beyond a high ness,\r\nHallblithe thought he saw down by the edge of the sea something darker\r\nthan the face of the rock-wall, and he deemed it was a cave: they came a\r\nlittle nearer and he saw it was a great cave high enough to let a round-\r\nship go in with all her sails set.\r\n\r\n"Son of the Raven," quoth Fox, "hearken, for thy heart is not little.\r\nYonder is the gate into the Isle of Ransom, and if thou wilt, thou mayst\r\ngo through it.  Yet it may be that if thou goest ashore on to the Isle\r\nsomething grievous shall befall thee, a trouble more than thou canst\r\nbear: a shame it may be.  Now there are two choices for thee: either to\r\ngo up on to the Isle and face all; or to die here by my hand having done\r\nnothing unmanly or shameful: What sayest thou?"\r\n\r\n"Thou art of many words when time so presses, Fox," said Hallblithe.  "Why\r\nshould I not choose to go up on to the Island to deliver my trothplight\r\nmaiden?  For the rest, slay me if thou canst, if we come alive out of\r\nthis cauldron of waters."\r\n\r\nSaid the big red man: "Look on then, and note Fox how he steereth, as it\r\nwere through a needle\'s eye."\r\n\r\nNow were they underneath the black shadow of the black cliff and amidst\r\nthe twilight the surf was tossed about like white fire.  In the lower\r\nheavens the stars were beginning to twinkle and the moon was bright and\r\nyellow, and aloft all was peaceful, for no cloud sullied the sky.  One\r\nmoment Hallblithe saw all this hanging above the turmoil of thundering\r\nwater and dripping rock and the next he was in the darkness of the cave,\r\nthe roaring wind and the waves still making thunder about him, though of\r\na different voice from the harsh hubbub without.  Then he heard Fox say:\r\n"Sit down now and take the oars, for presently shall we be at home at the\r\nlanding place."\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe took the oars and rowed, and as they went up the cave the\r\nsea fell, and the wind died out into the aimless gustiness of hollow\r\nplaces; and for a little while was all as dark as dark might be.  Then\r\nHallblithe saw that the darkness grew a little greyer, and he looked over\r\nhis shoulder and saw a star of light before the bows of the boat, and Fox\r\ncried out: "Yea, it is like day; bright will the moon be for such as\r\nneeds must be wayfaring to-night!  Cease rowing, O Son of the coal-blue\r\nfowl, for there is way enough on her."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe lay on his oars, and in a minute the bows smote the land;\r\nthen he turned about and saw a steep stair of stone, and up the sloping\r\nshaft thereof the moonlit sky and the bright stars.  Then Fox arose and\r\ncame forward and leapt out of the boat and moored her to a big stone:\r\nthen he leapt back again and said: "Bear a hand with the victuals; we\r\nmust bring them out of the boat unless thou wilt sleep supperless, as I\r\nwill not.  For to-night must we be guests to ourselves, since it is far\r\nto the dwelling of my people, and the old man is said to be a\r\nskin-changer, a flit-by-night.  And as to this cave, it is deemed to be\r\nnowise safe to sleep therein, unless the sleeper have a double share of\r\nluck.  And thy luck, meseemeth, O Son of the Raven, is as now somewhat\r\nless than a single share.  So to-night we shall sleep under the naked\r\nheaven."\r\n\r\nHallblithe yea-said this, and they took the meat and drink, such as they\r\nneeded, from out the boat, and climbed the steep stair no little way, and\r\nso came out on to a plain place, which seemed to Hallblithe bare and\r\nwaste so far as he saw it by the moonlight; for the twilight was gone\r\nnow, and nought was left of the light of day save a glimmer in the west.\r\n\r\nThis Hallblithe deemed wonderful, that no less out on the open heath and\r\nbrow of the land than in the shut-in cave, all that tumult of the wind\r\nhad fallen, and the cloudless night was calm, and with a little air\r\nblowing from the south and the landward.\r\n\r\nTherewithal was Fox done with his loud-voiced braggart mood, and spoke\r\ngently and peaceably like to a wayfarer, who hath business of his to look\r\nto as other men.  Now he pointed to certain rocks or low crags that a\r\nlittle way off rose like a reef out of the treeless plain; then said he:\r\n"Shipmate, underneath yonder rocks is our resting-place for to-night; and\r\nI pray thee not to deem me churlish that I give thee no better harbour.\r\nBut I have a charge over thee to bring thee safe thus far on thy quest;\r\nand thou wouldst find it hard to live among such housemates as thou\r\nwouldst find up yonder amongst our folks to-night.  But to-morrow shalt\r\nthou come to speech with him who will deal with thee concerning the\r\nransom."\r\n\r\n"It is enough," said Hallblithe, "and I thank thee for thy leading: and\r\nas for thy rough and uncomely words which thou hast given me, I pardon\r\nthee for them: for I am none the worse of them: forsooth, if I had been,\r\nmy sword would have had a voice in the matter."\r\n\r\n"I am well content as it is, Son of the Raven," quoth Fox; "I have done\r\nmy bidding and all is well."\r\n\r\n"Tell me then who it is hath bidden thee bring me hither?"\r\n\r\n"I may not tell thee," said Fox; "thou art here, be content, as I am."\r\n\r\nAnd he spake no more till they had come to the reef aforesaid, which was\r\nsome two furlongs from the place where they had come from out of the\r\ncave.  There then they set forth their supper on the stones, and ate what\r\nthey would, and drank of that good strong wine while the horn bare out.\r\nAnd now was Fox of few words, and when Hallblithe asked him concerning\r\nthat land, he had little to say.  And at last when Hallblithe asked him\r\nof that so perilous house and those who manned it, he said to him:\r\n\r\n"Son of the Raven, it avails not asking of these matters; for if I tell\r\nthee aught concerning them I shall tell thee lies.  Once again let it be\r\nenough for thee that thou hast passed over the sea safely on thy quest;\r\nand a more perilous sea it is forsooth than thou deemest.  But now let us\r\nhave an end of vain words, and make our bed amidst these stones as best\r\nwe may; for we should be stirring betimes in the morning."  Hallblithe\r\nsaid little in answer, and they arrayed their sleeping places cunningly,\r\nas the hare doth her form, and like men well used to lying abroad.\r\n\r\nHallblithe was very weary and he soon fell asleep; and as he lay there,\r\nhe dreamed a dream, or maybe saw a vision; whether he were asleep when he\r\nsaw it, or between sleeping and waking, I know not.  But this was his\r\ndream or his vision; that the Hostage was standing over him, and she as\r\nhe had seen her but yesterday, bright-haired and ruddy-cheeked and white-\r\nskinned, kind of hand and soft of voice, and she said to him:\r\n"Hallblithe, look on me and hearken, for I have a message for thee."  And\r\nhe looked and longed for her, and his soul was ravished by the sweetness\r\nof his longing, and he would have leapt up and cast his arms about her,\r\nbut sleep and the dream bound him, and he might not.  Then the image\r\nsmiled on him and said: "Nay, my love, lie still, for thou mayst not\r\ntouch me: here is but the image of the body which thou desirest.  Hearken\r\nthen.  I am in evil plight, in the hands of strong-thieves of the sea,\r\nnor know I what they will do with me, and I have no will to be shamed; to\r\nbe sold for a price from one hand to another, yet to be bedded without a\r\nprice, and to lie beside some foe-man of our folk, and he to cast his\r\narms about me, will I, will I not: this is a hard case.  Therefore to-\r\nmorrow morning at daybreak while men sleep, I think to steal forth to the\r\ngunwale of the black ship and give myself to the gods, that they and not\r\nthese runagates may be masters of my life and my soul, and may do with me\r\nas they will: for indeed they know that I may not bear the strange\r\nkinless house, and the love and caressing of the alien house-master, and\r\nthe mocking and stripes of the alien house-mistress.  Therefore let the\r\nHoary One of the sea take me and look to my matters, and carry me to life\r\nor death, which-so he will.  Thin now grows the night, but lie still a\r\nlittle yet, while I speak another word.\r\n\r\n"Maybe we shall meet alive again, and maybe not: and if not, though we\r\nhave never yet lain in one bed together, yet I would have thee remember\r\nme: yet not so that my image shall come between thee and thy\r\nspeech-friend and bed-fellow of the kindred, that shall lie where I was\r\nto have lain.  Yet again, if I live and thou livest, I have been told and\r\nhave heard that by one way or other I am like to come to the Glittering\r\nPlain, and the Land of Living Men.  O my beloved, if by any way thou\r\nmightest come thither also, and we might meet there, and we two alive,\r\nhow good it were!  Seek that land then, beloved! seek it, whether or no\r\nwe once more behold the House of the Rose, or tread the floor of the\r\nRaven dwelling.  And now must even this image of me sunder from thee.\r\nFarewell!"\r\n\r\nTherewith was the dream done and the vision departed; and Hallblithe sat\r\nup full of anguish and longing; and he looked about him over the dreary\r\nland, and it was somewhat light and the sky was grown grey and cloudy,\r\nand he deemed that the dawn was come.  So he leapt to his feet and\r\nstooped down over Fox, and took him by the shoulder, and shook him and\r\nsaid: "Faring-fellow, awake! the dawn is come, and we have much to do."\r\n\r\nFox sat up and growled like a dog, and rubbed his eyes and looked about\r\nhim and said: "Thou hast waked me for nought: it is the false dawn of the\r\nmoon that shineth now behind the clouds and casteth no shadow; it is but\r\nan hour after midnight.  Go to sleep again, and let me be, else will I\r\nnot be a guide to thee when the day comes."  And he lay down and was\r\nasleep at once.  Then Hallblithe went and lay down again full of sorrow:\r\nYet so weary was he that he presently fell asleep, and dreamed no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: OF A DWELLING OF MAN ON THE ISLE OF RANSOM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke again the sun shone on him, and the morning was calm and\r\nwindless.  He sat up and looked about him, but could see no signs of Fox\r\nsave the lair wherein he had lain.  So he arose to his feet and sought\r\nfor him about the crannies of the rocks, and found him not; and he\r\nshouted for him, and had no answer.  Then he said, "Belike he has gone\r\ndown to the boat to put a thing in, or take a thing out."  So he went his\r\nways to the stair down into the water-cave, and he called on Fox from the\r\ntop of the stair, and had no answer.\r\n\r\nSo he went down that long stair with a misgiving in his heart, and when\r\nhe came to the last step there was neither man nor boat, nor aught else\r\nsave the water and the living rock.  Then was he exceeding wroth, for he\r\nknew that he had been beguiled, and he was in an evil case, left alone on\r\nan Isle that he knew not, a waste and desolate land, where it seemed most\r\nlike he should die of famine.\r\n\r\nHe wasted no breath or might now in crying out for Fox, or seeking him;\r\nfor he said to himself: "I might well have known that he was false and a\r\nliar, whereas he could scarce refrain his joy at my folly and his guile.\r\nNow is it for me to strive for life against death."\r\n\r\nThen he turned and went slowly up the stair, and came out on to the open\r\nface of that Isle, and he saw that it was waste indeed, and dreadful: a\r\nwilderness of black sand and stones and ice-borne rocks, with here and\r\nthere a little grass growing in the hollows, and here and there a dreary\r\nmire where the white-tufted rushes shook in the wind, and here and there\r\nstretches of moss blended with red-blossomed sengreen; and otherwhere\r\nnought but the wind-bitten creeping willow clinging to the black sand,\r\nwith a white bleached stick and a leaf or two, and again a stick and a\r\nleaf.  In the offing looking landward were great mountains, some very\r\ngreat and snow-capped, some bare to the tops; and all that was far away,\r\nsave the snow, was deep-blue in the sunny morning.  But about him on the\r\nheath were scattered rocks like the reef beneath which he had slept the\r\nlast night, and peaks, and hammers, and knolls of uncouth shapes.\r\n\r\nThen he went to the edge of the cliffs and looked down on the sea which\r\nlay wrinkled and rippling on toward the shore far below him, and long he\r\ngazed thereon and all about, but could see neither ship nor sail, nor\r\naught else save the washing of waves and the hovering of sea fowl.\r\n\r\nThen he said: "Were it not well if I were to seek that house-master of\r\nwhom Fox spake?  Might he not flit me at least to the Land of the\r\nGlittering Plain?  Woe is me! now am I of that woful company, and I also\r\nmust needs cry out, Where is the land?  Where is the land?"\r\n\r\nTherewith he turned toward the reef above their lair, but as he went he\r\nthought and said: "Nay, but was not this Stead a lie like the rest of\r\nFox\'s tale? and am I not alone in this sea-girt wilderness?  Yea, and\r\neven that image of my Beloved which I saw in the dream, perchance that\r\nalso was a mere beguiling; for now I see that the Puny Fox was in all\r\nways wiser than is meet and comely."  Yet again he said: "At least I will\r\nseek on, and find out whether there be another man dwelling on this\r\nhapless Isle, and then the worst of it will be battle with him, and death\r\nby point and edge rather than by hunger; or at the best we may become\r\nfriends and fellows and deliver each other."  Therewith he came to the\r\nreef, and with much ado climbed to the topmost of its rocks and looked\r\ndown thence landward: and betwixt him and the mountains, and by seeming\r\nnot very far off, he saw smoke arising: but no house he saw, nor any\r\nother token of a dwelling.  So he came down from the stone and turned his\r\nback upon the sea and went toward that smoke with his sword in its\r\nsheath, and his spear over his shoulder.  Rough and toilsome was the way:\r\nthree little dales he crossed amidst the mountain necks, each one narrow\r\nand bare, with a stream of water amidst, running seaward, and whether in\r\ndale or on ridge, he went ever amidst sand and stones, and the weeds of\r\nthe wilderness, and saw no man, or man-tended beast.\r\n\r\nAt last, after he had been four hours on the way, but had not gone very\r\nfar, he topped a stony bent, and from the brow thereof beheld a wide\r\nvalley grass-grown for the more part, with a river running through it,\r\nand sheep and kine and horses feeding up and down it.  And amidst this\r\ndale by the stream-side, was a dwelling of men, a long hall and other\r\nhouses about it builded of stone.\r\n\r\nThen was Hallblithe glad, and he strode down the bent speedily, his war-\r\ngear clashing upon him: and as he came to the foot thereof and on to the\r\ngrass of the dale, he got amongst the pasturing horses, and passed close\r\nby the horse-herd and a woman that was with him.  They scowled at him as\r\nhe went by, but meddled not with him in any way.  Although they were\r\ngiant-like of stature and fierce of face, they were not ill-favoured:\r\nthey were red-haired, and the woman as white as cream where the sun had\r\nnot burned her skin; they had no weapons that Hallblithe might see save\r\nthe goad in the hand of the carle.\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe passed on and came to the biggest house, the hall\r\naforesaid: it was very long, and low as for its length, not over shapely\r\nof fashion, a mere gabled heap of stones.  Low and strait was the door\r\nthereinto, and as Hallblithe entered stooping lowly, and the fire of the\r\nsteel of his spear that he held before him was quenched in the mirk of\r\nthe hall, he smiled and said to himself: "Now if there were one anigh who\r\nwould not have me enter alive, and he with a weapon in his hand, soon\r\nwere all the tale told."  But he got into the hall unsmitten, and stood\r\non the floor thereof, and spake: "The sele of the day to whomsoever is\r\nherein!  Will any man speak to the new comer?"\r\n\r\nBut none answered or gave him greeting; and as his eyes got used to the\r\ndusk of the hall, he looked about him, and neither on the floor or the\r\nhigh seat nor in any ingle could he see a man; and there was silence\r\nthere, save for the crackling of the flickering flame on the hearth\r\namidmost, and the running of the rats behind the panelling of the walls.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the hall was a row of shut-beds, and Hallblithe deemed\r\nthat there might be men therein; but since none had greeted him he\r\nrefrained him from searching them for fear of a trap, and he thought, "I\r\nwill abide amidst the floor, and if there be any that would deal with me,\r\nfriend or foe, let him come hither to me."\r\n\r\nSo he fell to walking up and down the hall from buttery to dais, and his\r\nwar-gear rattled upon him.  At last as he walked he thought he heard a\r\nsmall thin peevish voice, which yet was too husky for the squeak of a\r\nrat.  So he stayed his walk and stood still, and said: "Will any man\r\nspeak to Hallblithe, a newcomer, and a stranger in this Stead?"\r\n\r\nThen that small voice made a word and said: "Why paceth the fool up and\r\ndown our hall, doing nothing, even as the Ravens flap croaking about the\r\ncrags, abiding the war-mote and the clash of the fallow blades?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe, and his voice sounded big in the hall: "Who calleth\r\nHallblithe a fool and mocketh at the sons of the Raven?"\r\n\r\nSpake the voice: "Why cometh not the fool to the man that may not go to\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe bent forward to hearken, and he deemed that the voice\r\ncame from one of the shut-beds, so he leaned his spear against a pillar,\r\nand went into the shut-bed he had noted, and saw where there lay along in\r\nit a man exceeding old by seeming, sore wasted, with long hair as white\r\nas snow lying over the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\nWhen the elder saw Hallblithe, he laughed a thin cracked laugh as if in\r\nmockery and said: "Hail newcomer! wilt thou eat?"\r\n\r\n"Yea," said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"Go thou into the buttery then," said the old carle, "and there shalt\r\nthou find on the cupboard cakes and curds and cheese: eat thy fill, and\r\nwhen thou hast done, look in the ingle, and thou shalt see a cask of mead\r\nexceeding good, and a stoup thereby, and two silver cups; fill the stoup\r\nand bring it hither with the cups; and then may we talk amidst of\r\ndrinking, which is good for an old carle.  Hasten thou! or I shall deem\r\nthee a double fool who will not fare to fetch his meat, though he be\r\nhungry."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe laughed, and went down the hall into the buttery and\r\nfound the meat, and ate his fill, and came away with the drink back to\r\nthe Long-hoary man, who chuckled as he came and said: "Fill up now for\r\nthee and for me, and call a health to me and wish me somewhat."\r\n\r\n"I wish thee luck," said Hallblithe, and drank.  Said the elder: "And I\r\nwish thee more wits; is luck all that thou mayst wish me?  What luck may\r\nan outworn elder have?"\r\n\r\n"Well then," quoth Hallblithe, "what shall I wish thee?  Wouldst thou\r\nhave me wish thee youth?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, certes," said the Long-hoary, "that and nought else."\r\n\r\n"Youth then I wish thee, if it may avail thee aught," said Hallblithe,\r\nand he drank again therewith.\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said the old carle peevishly, "take a third cup, and wish me\r\nyouth with no idle words tacked thereto."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe raising the cup: "Herewith I wish thee youth!" and he\r\ndrank.\r\n\r\n"Good is the wish," said the elder; "now ask thou the old carle whatso\r\nthou wilt."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "What is this land called?"\r\n\r\n"Son," said the other, "hast thou heard it called the Isle of Ransom?"\r\n\r\n"Yea," said Hallblithe, "but what wilt thou call it?"\r\n\r\n"By no other name," said the hoary carle.\r\n\r\n"It is far from other lands?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"Yea," said the carle, "when the light winds blow, and the ships sail\r\nslow."\r\n\r\n"What do ye who live here?" said Hallblithe.  "How do ye live, what work\r\nwin ye?"\r\n\r\n"We win diverse work," said the elder, "but the gainfullest is robbing\r\nmen by the high hand."\r\n\r\n"Is it ye who have stolen from me the Hostage of the Rose?" said\r\nHallblithe.\r\n\r\nSaid the Long-hoary, "Maybe; I wot not; in diverse ways my kinsmen\r\ntraffic, and they visit many lands.  Why should they not have come to\r\nCleveland also?"\r\n\r\n"Is she in this Isle, thou old runagate?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"She is not, thou young fool," said the elder.  Then Hallblithe flushed\r\nred and spake: "Knowest thou the Puny Fox?"\r\n\r\n"How should I not?" said the carle, "since he is the son of one of my\r\nsons."\r\n\r\n"Dost thou call him a liar and a rogue?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\nThe elder laughed; "Else were I a fool," said he; "there are few bigger\r\nliars or bigger rogues than the Puny Fox!"\r\n\r\n"Is he here in this Isle?" said Hallblithe; "may I see him?"\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed again, and said: "Nay, he is not here, unless he hath\r\nturned fool since yesterday: why should he abide thy sword, since he hath\r\ndone what he would and brought thee hither?"\r\n\r\nThen he laughed, as a hen cackles a long while, and then said: "What more\r\nwilt thou ask me?"\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe was very wroth: "It availeth nought to ask," he said; "and\r\nnow I am in two minds whether I shall slay thee or not."\r\n\r\n"That were a meet deed for a Raven, but not for a man," said the carle,\r\n"and thou that hast wished me luck!  Ask, ask!"\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe was silent a long while.  Then the carle said, "Another\r\ncup for the longer after youth!"\r\n\r\nHallblithe filled, and gave to him, and the old man drank and said: "Thou\r\ndeemest us all liars in the Isle of Ransom because of thy beguiling by\r\nthe Puny Fox: but therein thou errest.  The Puny Fox is our chiefest\r\nliar, and doth for us the more part of such work as we need: therefore,\r\nwhy should we others lie.  Ask, ask!"\r\n\r\n"Well then," said Hallblithe, "why did the Puny Fox bewray me, and at\r\nwhose bidding?"\r\n\r\nSaid the elder: "I know, but I will not tell thee.  Is this a lie?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, I deem it not," said Hallblithe: "But, tell me, is it verily true\r\nthat my trothplight is not here, that I may ransom her?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Long-hoary: "I swear it by the Treasure of the Sea, that she is\r\nnot here: the tale was but a lie of the Puny Fox."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: A FEAST IN THE ISLE OF RANSOM\r\n\r\n\r\nHallblithe pondered his answer awhile with downcast eyes and said at\r\nlast: "Have ye a mind to ransom me, now that I have walked into the\r\ntrap?"\r\n\r\n"There is no need to talk of ransom," said the elder; "thou mayst go out\r\nof this house when thou wilt, nor will any meddle with thee if thou\r\nstrayest about the Isle, when I have set a mark on thee and given thee a\r\ntoken: nor wilt thou be hindered if thou hast a mind to leave the Isle,\r\nif thou canst find means thereto; moreover as long as thou art in the\r\nIsle, in this house mayst thou abide, eating and drinking and resting\r\nwith us."\r\n\r\n"How then may I leave this Isle?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\nThe elder laughed: "In a ship," said he.\r\n\r\n"And when," said Hallblithe, "shall I find a ship that shall carry me?"\r\n\r\nSaid the old carle, "Whither wouldest thou my son?"  Hallblithe was\r\nsilent a while, thinking what answer he should make; then he said: "I\r\nwould go to the land of the Glittering Plain."\r\n\r\n"Son, a ship shall not be lacking thee for that voyage," said the elder.\r\n"Thou mayst go to-morrow morn.  And I bid thee abide here to-night, and\r\nthy cheer shall not be ill.  Yet if thou wilt believe my word, it will be\r\nwell for thee to say as little as thou mayst to any man here, and that\r\nlittle as little proud as maybe: for our folk are short of temper and\r\nthou knowest there is no might against many.  Indeed it is not unlike\r\nthat they will not speak one word to thee, and if that be so, thou hast\r\nno need to open thy mouth to them.  And now I will tell thee that it is\r\ngood that thou hast chosen to go to the Glittering Plain.  For if thou\r\nwert otherwise minded, I wot not how thou wouldest get thee a keel to\r\ncarry thee, and the wings have not yet begun to sprout on thy shoulders,\r\nraven though thou be.  Now I am glad that thou art going thy ways to the\r\nGlittering Plain to-morrow; for thou wilt be good company to me on the\r\nway: and I deem that thou wilt be no churl when thou art glad."\r\n\r\n"What," said Hallblithe, "art thou wending thither, thou old man?"\r\n\r\n"Yea," said he, "nor shall any other be on the ship save thou and I, and\r\nthe mariners that waft us; and they forsooth shall not go aland there.\r\nWhy should not I go, since there are men to bear me aboard?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe, "And when thou art come aland there, what wilt thou do?"\r\n\r\n"Thou shalt see, my son," said the Long-hoary.  "It may be that thy good\r\nwishes shall be of avail to me.  But now since all this may only be if I\r\nlive through this night, and since my heart hath been warmed by the good\r\nmead, and thy fellowship, and whereas I am somewhat sleepy, and it is\r\nlong past noon, go forth into the hall, and leave me to sleep, that I may\r\nbe as sound as eld will let me to-morrow.  And as for thee, folk, both\r\nmen and women, shall presently come into the hall, and I deem not that\r\nany shall meddle with thee; but if so be that any challenge thee,\r\nwhatsoever may be his words, answer thou to him, \'THE HOUSE OF THE\r\nUNDYING,\' and there will be an end of it.  Only look thou to it that no\r\nnaked steel cometh out of thy scabbard.  Go now, and if thou wilt, go out\r\nof doors; yet art thou safer within doors and nigher unto me."\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe went back into the main hall, and the sun had gotten round\r\nnow, and was shining into the hall, through the clerestory windows, so\r\nthat he saw clearly all that was therein.  And he deemed the hall fairer\r\nwithin than without; and especially over the shut-beds were many stories\r\ncarven in the panelling, and Hallblithe beheld them gladly.  But of one\r\nthing he marvelled, that whereas he was in an island of the\r\nstrong-thieves of the waters, and in their very home and chiefest\r\nhabitation, there were no ships or seas pictured in that imagery, but\r\nfair groves and gardens, with flowery grass and fruited trees all about.\r\nAnd there were fair women abiding therein, and lovely young men, and\r\nwarriors, and strange beasts and many marvels, and the ending of wrath\r\nand beginning of pleasure and the crowning of love.  And amidst these was\r\npictured oft and again a mighty king with a sword by his side and a crown\r\non his head; and ever was he smiling and joyous, so that Hallblithe, when\r\nhe looked on him, felt of better heart and smiled back on the carven\r\nimage.\r\n\r\nSo while Hallblithe looked on these things, and pondered his case\r\ncarefully, all alone as he was in that alien hall, he heard a noise\r\nwithout of talking and laughter, and presently the pattering of feet\r\ntherewith, and then women came into the hall, a score or more, some\r\nyoung, some old, some fair enough, and some hard-featured and uncomely,\r\nbut all above the stature of the women whom he had seen in his own land.\r\n\r\nSo he stood amidst the hall-floor and abided them; and they saw him and\r\nhis shining war-gear, and ceased their talking and laughter, and drew\r\nround about him, and gazed at him; but none said aught till an old crone\r\ncame forth from the ring, and said "Who art thou, standing under weapons\r\nin our hall?"\r\n\r\nHe knew not what to answer, and held his peace; and she spake again:\r\n"Whither wouldest thou, what seekest thou?"\r\n\r\nThen answered Hallblithe: "THE HOUSE OF THE UNDYING."\r\n\r\nNone answered, and the other women all fell away from him at once, and\r\nwent about their business hither and thither through the hall.  But the\r\nold crone took him by the hand, and led him up to the dais, and set him\r\nnext to the midmost high-seat.  Then she made as if she would do off his\r\nwar-gear, and he would not gainsay her, though he deemed that foes might\r\nbe anear; for in sooth he trusted in the old carle that he would not\r\nbewray him, and moreover he deemed it would be unmanly not to take the\r\nrisks of the guesting, according to the custom of that country.\r\n\r\nSo she took his armour and his weapons and bore them off to a shut-bed\r\nnext to that wherein lay the ancient man, and she laid the gear within\r\nit, all save the spear, which she laid on the wall-pins above; and she\r\nmade signs to him that therein he was to lie; but she spake no word to\r\nhim.  Then she brought him the hand-washing water in a basin of latten,\r\nand a goodly towel therewith, and when he had washed she went away from\r\nhim, but not far.\r\n\r\nThis while the other women were busy about the hall; some swept the floor\r\ndown, and when it was swept strawed thereon rushes and handfuls of wild\r\nthyme: some went into the buttery and bore forth the boards and the\r\ntrestles: some went to the chests and brought out the rich hangings, the\r\ngoodly bankers and dorsars, and did them on the walls: some bore in the\r\nstoups and horns and beakers, and some went their ways and came not back\r\na while, for they were busied about the cooking.  But whatever they did,\r\nnone hailed him, or heeded him more than if he had been an image, as he\r\nsat there looking on.  None save the old woman who brought him the fore-\r\nsupper, to wit a great horn of mead, and cakes and dried fish.\r\n\r\nSo was the hall arrayed for the feast very fairly, and Hallblithe sat\r\nthere while the sun westered and the house grew dim, and dark at last,\r\nand they lighted the candles up and down the hall.  But a little after\r\nthese were lit, a great horn was winded close without, and thereafter\r\ncame the clatter of arms about the door, and exceeding tall weaponed men\r\ncame in, one score and five, and strode two by two up to the foot of the\r\ndais, and stood there in a row.  And Hallblithe deemed their war-gear\r\nexceeding good; they were all clad in ring-locked byrnies, and had steel\r\nhelms on their heads with garlands of gold wrought about them and they\r\nbore spears in their hands, and white shields hung at their backs.  Now\r\ncame the women to them and unarmed them; and under their armour their\r\nraiment was black; but they had gold rings on their arms, and golden\r\ncollars about their necks.  So they strode up to the dais and took their\r\nplaces on the high-seat, not heeding Hallblithe any more than if he were\r\nan image of wood.  Nevertheless that man sat next to him who was the\r\nchieftain of all and sat in the midmost high-seat; and he bore his\r\nsheathed sword in his hand and laid it on the board before him, and he\r\nwas the only man of those chieftains who had a weapon.\r\n\r\nBut when these were set down there was again a noise without, and there\r\ncame in a throng of men armed and unarmed who took their places on the\r\nend-long benches up and down the hall; with these came women also, who\r\nmost of them sat amongst the men, but some busied them with the serving:\r\nall these men were great of stature, but none so big as the chieftains on\r\nthe high-seat.\r\n\r\nNow came the women in from the kitchen bearing the meat, whereof no\r\nlittle was flesh-meat, and all was of the best.  Hallblithe was duly\r\nserved like the others, but still none spake to him or even looked on\r\nhim; though amongst themselves they spoke in big, rough voices so that\r\nthe rafters of the hall rang again.\r\n\r\nWhen they had eaten their fill the women filled round the cups and the\r\nhorns to them, and those vessels were both great and goodly.  But ere\r\nthey fell to drinking uprose the chieftain who sat furthest from the\r\nmidmost high-seat on the right and cried a health: "THE TREASURE OF THE\r\nSEA!"  Then they all stood up and shouted, women as well as men, and\r\nemptied their horns and cups to that health.  Then stood up the man\r\nfurthest on the left and cried out, "Drink a health to the Undying King!"\r\nAnd again all men rose up and shouted ere they drank.  Other healths they\r\ndrank, as the "Cold Keel," the "Windworn Sail," the "Quivering Ash" and\r\nthe "Furrowed Beach."  And the wine and mead flowed like rivers in that\r\nhall of the Wild Men.  As for Hallblithe, he drank what he would but\r\nstood not up, nor raised his cup to his lips when a health was drunk; for\r\nhe knew not whether these men were his friends or his foes, and he deemed\r\nit would be little-minded to drink to their healths, lest he might be\r\ndrinking death and confusion to his own kindred.\r\n\r\nBut when men had drunk a while, again a horn blew at the nether end of\r\nthe hall, and straightway folk arose from the endlong tables, and took\r\naway the boards and trestles, and cleared the floor and stood against the\r\nwall; then the big chieftain beside Hallblithe arose and cried out: "Now\r\nlet man dance with maid, and be we merry!  Music, strike up!"  Then flew\r\nthe fiddle-bows and twanged the harps, and the carles and queens stood\r\nforth on the floor; and all the women were clad in black raiment, albeit\r\nembroidered with knots and wreaths of flowers.  A while they danced and\r\nthen suddenly the music fell, and they all went back to their places.\r\nThen the chieftain in the high-seat arose and took a horn from his side,\r\nand blew a great blast on it that filled the hall; then he cried in a\r\nloud voice: "Be we merry!  Let the champions come forth!"\r\n\r\nMen shouted gleefully thereat, and straightway ran into the hall from out\r\nthe screens three tall men clad all in black armour with naked swords in\r\ntheir hands, and stood amidst the hall-floor, somewhat on one side, and\r\nclashed their swords on their shields and cried out: "Come forth ye\r\nChampions of the Raven!"\r\n\r\nThen leapt Hallblithe from his seat and set his hand to his left side,\r\nbut no sword was there; so he sat down again, remembering the warning of\r\nthe Elder, and none heeded him.\r\n\r\nThen there came into the hall slowly and mournfully three men-at-arms,\r\nclad and weaponed like the warriors of his folk, with the image of the\r\nRaven on their helms and shields.  So Hallblithe refrained him, for\r\nbesides that this seemed like to be a fair battle of three against three,\r\nhe doubted some snare, and he determined to look on and abide.\r\n\r\nSo the champions fell to laying on strokes that were no child\'s play,\r\nthough Hallblithe doubted if the edges bit, and it was but a little while\r\nbefore the Champions of the Raven fell one after another before the Wild\r\nMen, and folk drew them by the heels out into the buttery.  Then arose\r\ngreat laughter and jeering, and exceeding wroth was Hallblithe; howbeit\r\nhe refrained him because he remembered all he had to do.  But the three\r\nChampions of the Sea strode round the hall, tossing up their swords and\r\ncatching them as they fell, while the horns blew up behind them.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the hall grew hushed, and the chieftain arose and cried:\r\n"Bring in now some sheaves of the harvest we win, we lads of the oar and\r\nthe arrow!"  Then was there a stir at the screen doors, and folk pressed\r\nforward to see, and, lo, there came forward a string of women, led in by\r\ntwo weaponed carles; and the women were a score in number, and they were\r\nbarefoot and their hair hung loose and their gowns were ungirt, and they\r\nwere chained together wrist to wrist; yet had they gold at arm and neck:\r\nthere was silence in the hall when they stood amidst of the floor.\r\n\r\nThen indeed Hallblithe could not refrain himself, and he leapt from his\r\nseat and on to the board, and over it, and ran down the hall, and came to\r\nthose women and looked them in the face one by one, while no man spake in\r\nthe hall.  But the Hostage was not amongst them; nay forsooth, they none\r\nof them favoured of the daughters of his people, though they were comely\r\nand fair; so that again Hallblithe doubted if this were aught but a feast-\r\nhall play done to anger him; whereas there was but little grief in the\r\nfaces of those damsels, and more than one of them smiled wantonly in his\r\nface as he looked on them.\r\n\r\nSo he turned about and went back to his seat, having said no word, and\r\nbehind him arose much mocking and jeering; but it angered him little now;\r\nfor he remembered the rede of the elder and how that he had done\r\naccording to his bidding, so that he deemed the gain was his.  So sprang\r\nup talk in the hall betwixt man and man, and folk drank about and were\r\nmerry, till the chieftain arose again and smote the board with the flat\r\nof his sword, and cried out in a loud and angry voice, so that all could\r\nhear: "Now let there be music and minstrelsy ere we wend bedward!"\r\n\r\nTherewith fell the hubbub of voices, and there came forth three men with\r\ngreat harps, and a fourth man with them, who was the minstrel; and the\r\nharpers smote their harps so that the roof rang therewith, and the noise,\r\nthough it was great, was tuneable, and when they had played thus a little\r\nwhile, they abated their loudness somewhat, and the minstrel lifted his\r\nvoice and sang:\r\n\r\n         The land lies black\r\n         With winter\'s lack,\r\n         The wind blows cold\r\n         Round field and fold;\r\n         All folk are within,\r\n         And but weaving they win.\r\n   Where from finger to finger the shuttle flies fast,\r\n   And the eyes of the singer look fain on the cast,\r\n   As he singeth the story of summer undone\r\n   And the barley sheaves hoary ripe under the sun.\r\n\r\n         Then the maidens stay\r\n         The light-hung sley,\r\n         And the shuttles bide\r\n         By the blue web\'s side,\r\n         While hand in hand\r\n         With the carles they stand.\r\n   But ere to the measure the fiddles strike up,\r\n   And the elders yet treasure the last of the cup,\r\n   There stand they a-hearkening the blast from the lift,\r\n   And e\'en night is a-darkening more under the drift.\r\n\r\n         There safe in the hall\r\n         They bless the wall,\r\n         And the roof o\'er head,\r\n         Of the valiant stead;\r\n         And the hands they praise\r\n         Of the olden days.\r\n   Then through the storm\'s roaring the fiddles break out,\r\n   And they think not of warring, but cast away doubt,\r\n   And, man before maiden, their feet tread the floor,\r\n   And their hearts are unladen of all that they bore.\r\n\r\n         But what winds are o\'er-cold\r\n         For the heart of the bold?\r\n         What seas are o\'er-high\r\n         For the undoomed to die?\r\n         Dark night and dread wind,\r\n         But the haven we find.\r\n   Then ashore mid the flurry of stone-washing surf!\r\n   Cloud-hounds the moon worry, but light lies the turf;\r\n   Lo the long dale before us! the lights at the end,\r\n   Though the night darkens o\'er us, bid whither to wend.\r\n\r\n         Who beateth the door\r\n         By the foot-smitten floor?\r\n         What guests are these\r\n         From over the seas?\r\n         Take shield and sword\r\n         For their greeting-word.\r\n   Lo, lo, the dance ended!  Lo, midst of the hall\r\n   The fallow blades blended!  Lo, blood on the wall!\r\n   Who liveth, who dieth?  O men of the sea,\r\n   For peace the folk crieth; our masters are ye.\r\n\r\n         Now the dale lies grey\r\n         At the dawn of day;\r\n         And fair feet pass\r\n         O\'er the wind-worn grass;\r\n         And they turn back to gaze\r\n         On the roof of old days.\r\n   Come tread ye the oaken-floored hall of the sea!\r\n   Be your hearts yet unbroken; so fair as ye be,\r\n   That kings are abiding unwedded to gain\r\n   The news of our riding the steeds of the main.\r\n\r\nMuch shouting and laughter arose at the song\'s end; and men sprang up and\r\nwaved their swords above the cups, while Hallblithe sat scowling down on\r\ntheir merriment.  Lastly arose the chieftain and called out loudly for\r\nthe good-night cup, and it went round and all men drank.  Then the horn\r\nblew for bed, and the chieftains went to their chambers, and the others\r\nwent to the out-bowers or laid them down on the hall-floor, and in a\r\nlittle while none stood upright thereon.  So Hallblithe arose, and went\r\nto the shut-bed appointed for him, and laid him down and slept\r\ndreamlessly till the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: HALLBLITHE TAKETH SHIP AGAIN AWAY FROM THE ISLE OF RANSOM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, the sun shone into the hall by the windows above the\r\nbuttery, and there were but few folk left therein.  But so soon as\r\nHallblithe was clad, the old woman came to him, and took him by the hand,\r\nand led him to the board, and signed to him to eat of what was thereon;\r\nand he did so; and by then he was done, came folk who went into the shut-\r\nbed where lay the Long-hoary, and they brought him forth bed and all and\r\nbare him out a-doors.  Then the crone brought Hallblithe his arms and he\r\ndid on byrny and helm, girt his sword to his side, took his spear in his\r\nhand and went out a-doors; and there close by the porch lay the\r\nLong-hoary upon a horse-litter.  So Hallblithe came up to him and gave\r\nhim the sele of the day: and the elder said: "Good morrow, son, I am glad\r\nto see thee.  Did they try thee hard last night?"\r\n\r\nAnd Hallblithe saw two of the carles that had borne out the elder, that\r\nthey were talking together, and they looked on him and laughed mockingly;\r\nso he said to the elder: "Even fools may try a wise man, and so it befell\r\nlast night.  Yet, as thou seest, mumming hath not slain me."\r\n\r\nSaid the old man: "What thou sawest was not all mumming; it was done\r\naccording to our customs; and well nigh all of it had been done, even\r\nhadst thou not been there.  Nay, I will tell thee; at some of our feasts\r\nit is not lawful to eat either for the chieftains or the carles, till a\r\nchampion hath given forth a challenge, and been answered and met, and the\r\nbattle fought to an end.  But ye men, what hindereth you to go to the\r\nhorses\' heads and speed on the road the chieftain who is no longer way-\r\nworthy?"\r\n\r\nSo they ran to the horses and set down the dale by the riverside, and\r\njust as Hallblithe was going to follow afoot, there came a swain from\r\nbehind the house leading a red horse which he brought to Hallblithe as\r\none who bids mount.  So Hallblithe leapt into the saddle and at once\r\ncaught up with the litter of the Long-hoary down along the river.  They\r\npassed by no other house, save here and there a cot beside some fold or\r\nbyre; they went easily, for the way was smooth by the river-side; so in\r\nless than two hours they came where the said river ran into the sea.\r\nThere was no beach there, for the water was ten fathom deep close up to\r\nthe lip of the land; but there was a great haven land-locked all but a\r\nnarrow outgate betwixt the sheer black cliffs.  Many a great ship might\r\nhave lain in that haven; but as now there was but one lying there, a\r\nround-ship not very great, but exceeding trim and meet for the sea.\r\n\r\nThere without more ado the carles took the elder from the litter and bore\r\nhim aboard, and Hallblithe followed him as if he had been so appointed.\r\nThey laid the old man adown on the poop under a tilt of precious web, and\r\nso went aback by the way that they had come; and Hallblithe went and sat\r\ndown beside the Long-hoary, who spake to him and said: "Seest thou, son,\r\nhow easy it is for us twain to be shipped for the land whither we would\r\ngo?  But as easy as it is for thee to go thither whereas we are going,\r\njust so hard had it been for thee to go elsewhere.  Moreover I must tell\r\nthee that though many an one of the Isle of Ransom desireth to go this\r\nvoyage, there shall none else go, till the world is a year older, and he\r\nwho shall go then shall be likest to me in all ways, both in eld and in\r\nfeebleness, and in gibing speech, and all else; and now that I am gone,\r\nhis name shall be the same as that whereby ye may call me to-day, and\r\nthat is Grandfather.  Art thou glad or sorry, Hallblithe?"\r\n\r\n"Grandfather," said Hallblithe, "I can scarce tell thee: I move as one\r\nwho hath no will to wend one way or other.  Meseems I am drawn to go\r\nthither whereas we are going; therefore I deem that I shall find my\r\nbeloved on the Glittering Plain: and whatever befalleth afterward, let it\r\nbe as it will!"\r\n\r\n"Tell me, my son," said the Grandfather, "how many women are there in the\r\nworld?"\r\n\r\n"How may I tell thee?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said the elder, "how many exceeding fair women are there?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe, "Indeed I wot not."\r\n\r\n"How many of such hast thou seen?" said the Grandfather.\r\n\r\n"Many," said Hallblithe; "the daughters of my folk are fair, and there\r\nwill be many other such amongst the aliens."\r\n\r\nThen laughed the elder, and said: "Yet, my son, he who had been thy\r\nfellow since thy sundering from thy beloved, would have said that in thy\r\ndeeming there is but one woman in the world; or at least one fair woman:\r\nis it not so?"\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe reddened at first, as though he were angry; then he said:\r\n"Yea, it is so."\r\n\r\nSaid the Grandfather in a musing way: "I wonder if before long I shall\r\nthink of it as thou dost."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe gazed at him marvelling, and studied to see wherein lay\r\nthe gibe against himself; and the Grandfather beheld him, and laughed as\r\nwell as he might, and said: "Son, son; didst thou not wish me youth?"\r\n\r\n"Yea," said Hallblithe, "but what ails thee to laugh so?  What is it I\r\nhave said or done?"\r\n\r\n"Nought, nought," said the elder, laughing still more, "only thou lookest\r\nso mazed.  And who knoweth what thy wish may bring forth?"\r\n\r\nThereat was Hallblithe sore puzzled; but while he set himself to consider\r\nwhat the old carle might mean, uprose the hale and how of the mariners;\r\nthey cast off the hawsers from the shore, ran out the sweeps, and drave\r\nthe ship through the haven-gates.  It was a bright sunny day; within, the\r\ngreen water was oily-smooth, without the rippling waves danced merrily\r\nunder a light breeze, and Hallblithe deemed the wind to be fair; for the\r\nmariners shouted joyously and made all sail on the ship; and she lay over\r\nand sped through the waves, casting off the seas from her black bows.\r\nSoon were they clear of those swart cliffs, and it was but a little\r\nafterwards that the Isle of Ransom was grown deep blue behind them and\r\nfar away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX: THEY COME TO THE LAND OF THE GLITTERING PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in the hall, so in the ship, Hallblithe noted that the folk were merry\r\nand of many words one with another, while to him no man cast a word save\r\nthe Grandfather.  As to Hallblithe, though he wondered much what all this\r\nbetokened, and what the land was whereto he was wending, he was no man to\r\nfear an unboded peril; and he said to himself that whatever else betid,\r\nhe should meet the Hostage on the Glittering Plain; so his heart rose and\r\nhe was of good cheer, and as the Grandfather had foretold, he was a merry\r\nfaring-fellow to him.  Many a gibe the old man cast at him, and whiles\r\nHallblithe gave him back as good as he took, and whiles he laughed as the\r\nstroke went home and silenced him; and whiles he understood nought of\r\nwhat the elder said.  So wore the day and still the wind held fair,\r\nthough it was light; and the sun set in a sky nigh cloudless, and there\r\nwas nowhere any forecast of peril.  But when night was come, Hallblithe\r\nlay down on a fair bed, which was dight for him in the poop, and he soon\r\nfell asleep and dreamed not save such dreams as are but made up of bygone\r\nmemories, and betoken nought, and are not remembered.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, day lay broad on the sea, and the waves were little, the\r\nsky had but few clouds, the sun shone bright, and the air was warm and\r\nsweet-breathed.\r\n\r\nHe looked aside and saw the old man sitting up in his bed, as ghastly as\r\na dead man dug up again: his bushy eyebrows were wrinkled over his\r\nbleared old eyes, the long white hair dangled forlorn from his gaunt\r\nhead: yet was his face smiling and he looked as happy as the soul within\r\nhim could make the half-dead body.  He turned now to Hallblithe and said:\r\n\r\n"Thou art late awake: hadst thou been waking earlier, the sooner had\r\nthine heart been gladdened.  Go forward now, and gaze thy fill and come\r\nand tell me thereof."\r\n\r\n"Thou art happy, Grandfather," said Hallblithe, "what good tidings hath\r\nmorn brought us?"\r\n\r\n"The Land! the Land!" said the Long-hoary; "there are no longer tears in\r\nthis old body, else should I be weeping for joy."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Art thou going to meet some one who shall make thee\r\nglad before thou diest, old man?"\r\n\r\n"Some one?" said the elder; "what one?  Are they not all gone? burned,\r\nand drowned, and slain and died abed?  Some one, young man?  Yea,\r\nforsooth some one indeed!  Yea, the great warrior of the Wasters of the\r\nShore; the Sea-eagle who bore the sword and the torch and the terror of\r\nthe Ravagers over the coal-blue sea.  It is myself, MYSELF that I shall\r\nfind on the Land of the Glittering Plain, O young lover!"\r\n\r\nHallblithe looked on him wondering as he raised his wasted arms towards\r\nthe bows of the ship pitching down the slope of the sunlit sea, or\r\nclimbing up it.  Then again the old man fell back on his bed and\r\nmuttered: "What fool\'s work is this! that thou wilt draw me on to talk\r\nloud, and waste my body with lack of patience.  I will talk with thee no\r\nmore, lest my heart swell and break, and quench the little spark of life\r\nwithin me."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe arose to his feet, and stood looking at him, wondering so\r\nmuch at his words, that for a while he forgat the land which they were\r\nnearing, though he had caught glimpses of it, as the bows of the round-\r\nship fell downward into the hollow of the sea.  The wind was but light,\r\nas hath been said, and the waves little under it, but there was still a\r\nsmooth swell of the sea which came of breezes now dead, and the ship\r\nwallowed thereon and sailed but slowly.\r\n\r\nIn a while the old man opened his eyes again, and said in a low peevish\r\nvoice: "Why standest thou staring at me? why hast thou not gone forward\r\nto look upon the land?  True it is that ye Ravens are short of wits."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Be not wrath, chieftain; I was wondering at thy words,\r\nwhich are exceeding marvellous; tell me more of this land of the\r\nGlittering Plain."\r\n\r\nSaid the Grandfather: "Why should I tell it thee? ask of the mariners.\r\nThey all know more than thou dost."\r\n\r\n"Thou knowest," said Hallblithe, "that these men speak not to me, and\r\ntake no more heed of me than if I were an image which they were carrying\r\nto sell to the next mighty man they may hap on.  Or tell me, thou old\r\nman," said he fiercely, "is it perchance a thrall-market whereto they are\r\nbringing me?  Have they sold her there, and will they sell me also in the\r\nsame place, but into other hands."\r\n\r\n"Tush!" said the Grandfather somewhat feebly, "this last word of thine is\r\nfolly; there is no buying or selling in the land whereto we are bound.  As\r\nto thine other word, that these men have no fellowship with thee, it is\r\ntrue: thou art my fellow and the fellow of none else aboard.  Therefore\r\nif I feel might in me, maybe I will tell thee somewhat."\r\n\r\nThen he raised his head a little and said: "The sun grows hot, the wind\r\nfaileth us, and slow and slow are we sailing."\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke there was a stir amidships, and Hallblithe looked and\r\nbeheld the mariners handling the sweeps, and settling themselves on the\r\nrowing-benches.  Said the elder: "There is noise amidships, what are they\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\nThe old man raised himself a little again, and cried out in his shrill\r\nvoice: "Good lads! brave lads!  Thus would we do in the old time when we\r\ndrew anear some shore, and the beacons were sending up smoke by day, and\r\nflame benights; and the shore-abiders did on their helms and trembled.\r\nThrust her through, lads!  Thrust her along!"  Then he fell back again,\r\nand said in a weak voice: "Make no more delay, guest, but go forward and\r\nlook upon the land, and come back and tell me thereof, and then the tale\r\nmay flow from me.  Haste, haste!"  So Hallblithe went down from the poop,\r\nand in to the waist, where now the rowers were bending to their oars, and\r\ncrying out fiercely as they tugged at the quivering ash; and he clomb on\r\nto the forecastle and went forward right to the dragon-head, and gazed\r\nlong upon the land, while the dashing of the oar-blades made the\r\nsemblance of a gale about the ship\'s black sides.  Then he came back\r\nagain to the Sea-eagle, who said to him: "Son, what hast thou seen?"\r\n\r\n"Right ahead lieth the land, and it is still a good way off.  High rise\r\nthe mountains there, but by seeming there is no snow on them; and though\r\nthey be blue they are not blue like the mountains of the Isle of Ransom.\r\nAlso it seemed to me as if fair slopes of woodland and meadow come down\r\nto the edge of the sea.  But it is yet far away."\r\n\r\n"Yea," said the elder, "is it so?  Then will I not wear myself with\r\nmaking words for thee.  I will rest rather, and gather might.  Come again\r\nwhen an hour hath worn, and tell me what thou seest; and may happen then\r\nthou shalt have my tale!"  And he laid him down therewith and seemed to\r\nbe asleep at once.  And Hallblithe might not amend it; so he waited\r\npatiently till the hour had worn, and then went forward again, and looked\r\nlong and carefully, and came back and said to the Sea-eagle, "The hour is\r\nworn."\r\n\r\nThe old chieftain turned himself about and said "What hast thou seen?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "The mountains are pale and high, and below them are\r\nhills dark with wood, and betwixt them and the sea is a fair space of\r\nmeadowland, and methought it was wide."\r\n\r\nSaid the old man: "Sawest thou a rocky skerry rising high out of the sea\r\nanigh the shore?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Hallblithe, "if there be, it is all blended with the meadows\r\nand the hills."\r\n\r\nSaid the Sea-eagle: "Abide the wearing of another hour, and come and tell\r\nme again, and then I may have a gainful word for thee."  And he fell\r\nasleep again.  But Hallblithe abided, and when the hour was worn, he went\r\nforward and stood on the forecastle.  And this was the third shift of the\r\nrowers, and the stoutest men in the ship now held the oars in their\r\nhands, and the ship shook through all her length and breadth as they\r\ndrave her over the waters.\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe came aft to the old man and found him asleep; so he took\r\nhim by the shoulder, and shook him and said: "Awake, faring-fellow, for\r\nthe land is a-nigh."\r\n\r\nSo the old man sat up and said: "What hast thou seen?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "I have seen the peaks and cliffs of the far-off\r\nmountains; and below them are hills green with grass and dark with woods,\r\nand thence stretch soft green meadows down to the sea-strand, which is\r\nfair and smooth, and yellow."\r\n\r\n"Sawest thou the skerry?" said the Sea-eagle.\r\n\r\n"Yea, I saw it," said Hallblithe, "and it rises sheer from out the sea\r\nabout a mile from the yellow strand; but its rocks are black, like the\r\nrocks of the Isle of Ransom."\r\n\r\n"Son," said the elder, "give me thine hands and raise me up a little."  So\r\nHallblithe took him and raised him up, so that he sat leaning against the\r\npillows; and he looked not on Hallblithe, but on the bows of the ship,\r\nwhich now pitched but a little up and down, for the sea was laid quiet\r\nnow.  Then he cried in his shrill, piping voice: "It is the Land!  It is\r\nthe Land!"\r\n\r\nBut after a little while he turned to Hallblithe and spake: "Short is the\r\ntale to tell: thou hast wished me youth, and thy wish hath thriven; for\r\nto-day, ere the sun goes down, thou shalt see me as I was in the days\r\nwhen I reaped the harvest of the sea with sharp sword and hardy heart.\r\nFor this is the land of the Undying King, who is our lord and our gift-\r\ngiver; and to some he giveth the gift of youth renewed, and life that\r\nshall abide here the Gloom of the Gods.  But none of us all may come to\r\nthe Glittering Plain and the King Undying without turning the back for\r\nthe last time on the Isle of Ransom: nor may any men of the Isle come\r\nhither save those who are of the House of the Sea-eagle, and few of\r\nthose, save the chieftains of the House, such as are they who sat by thee\r\non the high-seat that even.  Of these once in a while is chosen one of\r\nus, who is old and spent and past battle, and is borne to this land and\r\nthe gift of the Undying.  Forsooth some of us have no will to take the\r\ngift, for they say they are liefer to go to where they shall meet more of\r\nour kindred than dwell on the Glittering Plain and the Acre of the\r\nUndying; but as for me I was ever an overbearing and masterful man, and\r\nmeseemeth it is well that I meet as few of our kindred as may be: for\r\nthey are a strifeful race."\r\n\r\nHereat Hallblithe marvelled exceedingly, and he said: "And what am I in\r\nall this story?  Why am I come hither with thy furtherance?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Sea-eagle: "We had a charge from the Undying King concerning\r\nthee, that we should bring thee hither alive and well, if so be thou\r\ncamest to the Isle of Ransom.  For what cause we had the charge, I know\r\nnot, nor do I greatly heed."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "And shall I also have that gift of undying youth, and\r\nlife while the world of men and gods endureth?"\r\n\r\n"I must needs deem so," said the Sea-eagle, "so long as thou abidest on\r\nthe Glittering Plain; and I see not how thou mayst ever escape thence."\r\n\r\nNow Hallblithe heard him, how he said "escape," and thereat he was\r\nsomewhat ill at ease, and stood and pondered a little.  At last he said:\r\n"Is this then all that thou hast to tell me concerning the Glittering\r\nPlain?"\r\n\r\n"By the Treasure of the Sea!" said the elder, "I know no more of it.  The\r\nliving shall learn.  But I suppose that thou mayst seek thy troth-plight\r\nmaiden there all thou wilt.  Or thou mayst pray the Undying King to have\r\nher thither to thee.  What know I?  At least, it is like that there shall\r\nbe no lack of fair women there: or else the promise of youth renewed is\r\nnought and vain.  Shall this not be enough for thee?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"What," said the elder, "must it be one woman only?"\r\n\r\n"One only," said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed his thin mocking laugh, and said: "I will not assure\r\nthee but that the land of the Glittering Plain shall change all that for\r\nthee so soon as it touches the soles of thy feet."\r\n\r\nHallblithe looked at him steadily and smiled, and said: "Well is it then\r\nthat I shall find the Hostage there; for then shall we be of one mind,\r\neither to sunder or to cleave together.  It is well with me this day."\r\n\r\n"And with me it shall be well ere long," said the Sea-eagle.\r\n\r\nBut now the rowers ceased rowing and lay on their oars, and the shipmen\r\ncast anchor; for they were but a bowshot from the shore, and the ship\r\nswung with the tide and lay side-long to the shore.  Then said the Sea-\r\neagle: "Look forth, shipmate, and tell me of the land."\r\n\r\nAnd Hallblithe looked and said: "The yellow beach is sandy and\r\nshell-strewn, as I deem, and there is no great space of it betwixt the\r\nsea and the flowery grass; and a bowshot from the strand I see a little\r\nwood amidst which are fair trees blossoming."\r\n\r\n"Seest thou any folk on the shore?" said the old man.  "Yea," said\r\nHallblithe, "close to the edge of the sea go four; and by seeming three\r\nare women, for their long gowns flutter in the wind.  And one of these is\r\nclad in saffron colour, and another in white, and another in watchet; but\r\nthe carle is clad in dark red; and their raiment is all glistening as\r\nwith gold and gems; and by seeming they are looking at our ship as though\r\nthey expected somewhat."\r\n\r\nSaid the Sea-eagle: "Why now do the shipmen tarry and have not made ready\r\nthe skiff?  Swillers and belly-gods they be; slothful swine that forget\r\ntheir chieftain."\r\n\r\nBut even as he spake came four of the shipmen, and without more ado took\r\nhim up, bed and all, and bore him down into the waist of the ship,\r\nwhereunder lay the skiff with four strong rowers lying on their oars.\r\nThese men made no sign to Hallblithe, nor took any heed of him; but he\r\ncaught up his spear, and followed them and stood by as they lowered the\r\nold man into the boat.  Then he set his foot on the gunwale of the ship\r\nand leapt down lightly into the boat, and none hindered or helped him;\r\nand he stood upright in the boat, a goodly image of battle with the sun\r\nflashing back from his bright helm, his spear in his hand, his white\r\nshield at his back, and thereon the image of the Raven; but if he had\r\nbeen but a salt-boiling carle of the sea-side none would have heeded him\r\nless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X: THEY HOLD CONVERSE WITH FOLK OF THE GLITTERING PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the rowers lifted the ash-blades, and fell to rowing towards shore:\r\nand almost with the first of their strokes, the Sea-eagle moaned out:\r\n\r\n"Would we were there, oh, would we were there!  Cold groweth eld about my\r\nheart.  Raven\'s Son, thou art standing up; tell me if thou canst see what\r\nthese folk of the land are doing, and if any others have come thither?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "There are none others come, but kine and horses are\r\nfeeding down the meadows.  As to what those four are doing, the women are\r\nputting off their shoon, and girding up their raiment, as if they would\r\nwade the water toward us; and the carle, who was barefoot before, wendeth\r\nstraight towards the sea, and there he standeth, for very little are the\r\nwaves become."\r\n\r\nThe old man answered nothing, and did but groan for lack of patience; but\r\npresently when the water was yet waist deep the rowers stayed the skiff,\r\nand two of them slipped over the gunwale into the sea, and between them\r\nall they took up the chieftain on his bed and got him forth from the boat\r\nand went toward the strand with him; and the landsfolk met them where the\r\nwater was shallower, and took him from their hands and bore him forth on\r\nto the yellow sand, and laid him down out of reach of the creeping ripple\r\nof the tide.  Hallblithe withal slipped lightly out of the boat and waded\r\nthe water after them.  But the shipmen rowed back again to their ship,\r\nand presently Hallblithe heard the hale and how, as they got up their\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nBut when Hallblithe was come ashore, and was drawn near the folk of the\r\nland, the women looked at him askance, and they laughed and said:\r\n"Welcome to thee also, O young man!"  And he beheld them, and saw that\r\nthey were of the stature of the maidens of his own land; they were\r\nexceeding fair of skin and shapely of fashion, so that the nakedness of\r\ntheir limbs under their girded gowns, and all glistening with the sea,\r\nwas most lovely and dainty to behold.  But Hallblithe knelt by the Sea-\r\neagle to note how he fared, and said: "How is it with thee, O chieftain?"\r\n\r\nThe old man answered not a word, and he seemed to be asleep, and\r\nHallblithe deemed that his cheeks were ruddier and his skin less wasted\r\nand wrinkled than aforetime.  Then spake one of those women: "Fear not,\r\nyoung man; he is well and will soon be better."  Her voice was as sweet\r\nas a spring bird in the morning; she was white-skinned and dark-haired,\r\nand full sweetly fashioned; and she laughed on Hallblithe, but not\r\nmockingly; and her fellows also laughed, as though it was strange for him\r\nto be there.  Then they did on their shoon again, and with the carle laid\r\ntheir hands to the bed whereon the old man lay, and lifted him up, and\r\nbore him forth on to the grass, turning their faces toward the flowery\r\nwood aforesaid; and they went a little way and then laid him down again\r\nand rested; and so on little by little, till they had brought him to the\r\nedge of the wood, and still he seemed to be asleep.  Then the damsel who\r\nhad spoken before, she with the dark hair, said to Hallblithe, "Although\r\nwe have gazed on thee as if with wonder, this is not because we did not\r\nlook to meet thee, but because thou art so fair and goodly a man: so\r\nabide thou here till we come back to thee from out of the wood."\r\n\r\nTherewith she stroked his hand, and with her fellows lifted the old man\r\nonce more, and they bore him out of sight into the thicket.\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe went to and fro a dozen paces from the wood, and looked\r\nacross the flowery meads and deemed he had never seen any so fair.  And\r\nafar off toward the hills he saw a great roof arising, and thought he\r\ncould see men also; and nigher to him were kine pasturing, and horses\r\nalso, whereof some drew anear him and stretched out their necks and gazed\r\nat him; and they were goodly after their kind; and a fair stream of water\r\ncame round the corner out of the wood and down the meadows to the sea;\r\nand Hallblithe went thereto and could see that there was but little ebb\r\nand flow of the tide on that shore; for the water of the stream was clear\r\nas glass, and the grass and flowers grew right down to its water; so he\r\nput off his helm and drank of the stream and washed his face and his\r\nhands therein, and then did on his helm again and turned back again\r\ntoward the wood, feeling very strong and merry; and he looked out seaward\r\nand saw the Ship of the Isle of Ransom lessening fast; for a little land\r\nwind had arisen and they had spread their sails to it; and he laid down\r\non the grass till the four folk of the country came out of the wood\r\nagain, after they had been gone somewhat less than an hour, but the Sea-\r\neagle was not with them: and Hallblithe rose up and turned to them, and\r\nthe carle saluted him and departed, going straight toward that far-away\r\nroof he had seen; and the women were left with Hallblithe, and they\r\nlooked at him and he at them as he stood leaning on his spear.\r\n\r\nThen said the black-haired damsel: "True it is, O Spearman, that if we\r\ndid not know of thee, our wonder would be great that a man so young and\r\nlucky-looking should have sought hither."\r\n\r\n"I wot not why thou shouldest wonder," said Hallblithe; "I will tell thee\r\npresently wherefore I come hither.  But tell me, is this the Land of the\r\nGlittering Plain?"\r\n\r\n"Even so," said the damsel, "dost thou not see how the sun shineth on it?\r\nJust so it shineth in the season that other folks call winter."\r\n\r\n"Some such marvel I thought to hear of," said he; "for I have been told\r\nthat the land is marvellous; and fair though these meadows be, they are\r\nnot marvellous to look on now: they are like other lands, though it\r\nmaybe, fairer."\r\n\r\n"That may be," she said; "we have nought but hearsay of other lands.  If\r\nwe ever knew them we have forgotten them."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe, "Is this land called also the Acre of the Undying?"\r\n\r\nAs he spake the words the smile faded from the damsel\'s face; she and her\r\nfellows grew pale, and she said: "Hold thy peace of such words!  They are\r\nnot lawful for any man to utter here.  Yet mayst thou call it the Land of\r\nthe Living."\r\n\r\nHe said: "I crave pardon for the rash word."\r\n\r\nThen they smiled again, and drew near to him, and caressed him with their\r\nhands, and looked on him lovingly; but he drew a little aback from them\r\nand said: "I have come hither seeking something which I have lost, the\r\nlack whereof grieveth me."\r\n\r\nQuoth the damsel, drawing nearer to him again, "Mayst thou find it, thou\r\nlovely man, and whatsoever else thou desirest."\r\n\r\nThen he said: "Hath a woman named the Hostage been brought hither of late\r\ndays?  A fair woman, bright-haired and grey-eyed, kind of countenance,\r\nsoft of speech, yet outspoken and nought timorous; tall according to our\r\nstature, but very goodly of fashion; a woman of the House of the Rose,\r\nand my troth-plight maiden."\r\n\r\nThey looked on each other and shook their heads, and the black-haired\r\ndamsel spake: "We know of no such a woman, nor of the kindred which thou\r\nnamest."\r\n\r\nThen his countenance fell, and became piteous with desire and grief, and\r\nhe bent his brows upon them, for they seemed to him light-minded and\r\ncareless, though they were lovely.\r\n\r\nBut they shrank from him trembling, and drew aback; for they had all been\r\nstanding close to him, beholding him with love, and she who had spoken\r\nmost had been holding his left hand fondly.  But now she said: "Nay, look\r\nnot on us so bitterly!  If the woman be not in the land, this cometh not\r\nof our malice.  Yet maybe she is here.  For such as come hither keep not\r\ntheir old names, and soon forget them what they were.  Thou shalt go with\r\nus to the King, and he shall do for thee what thou wilt; for he is\r\nexceeding mighty."\r\n\r\nThen was Hallblithe appeased somewhat; and he said: "Are there many women\r\nin the land?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, many," said that damsel.\r\n\r\n"And many that are as fair as ye be?" said he.  Then they laughed and\r\nwere glad, and drew near to him again and took his hands and kissed them;\r\nand the black-haired damsel said: "Yea, yea, there be many as fair as we\r\nbe, and some fairer," and she laughed.\r\n\r\n"And that King of yours," said he, "how do ye name him?"\r\n\r\n"He is the King," said the damsel.\r\n\r\n"Hath he no other name?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"We may not utter it," she said; "but thou shalt see him soon, that there\r\nis nought but good in him and mightiness."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI: THE SEA-EAGLE RENEWETH HIS LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut while they spake together thus, came a man from out of the wood very\r\ntall of stature, red-bearded and black-haired, ruddy-cheeked,\r\nfull-limbed, most joyous of aspect; a man by seeming of five and thirty\r\nwinters.  He strode straight up to Hallblithe, and cast his arms about\r\nhim, and kissed his cheek, as if he had been an old and dear friend newly\r\ncome from over seas.\r\n\r\nHallblithe wondered and laughed, and said: "Who art thou that deemest me\r\nso dear?"\r\n\r\nSaid the man: "Short is thy memory, Son of the Raven, that thou in so\r\nlittle space hast forgotten thy shipmate and thy faring-fellow; who gave\r\nthee meat and drink and good rede in the Hall of the Ravagers."  Therewith\r\nhe laughed joyously and turned about to the three maidens and took them\r\nby the hands and kissed their lips, while they fawned upon him lovingly.\r\n\r\nThen said Hallblithe: "Hast thou verily gotten thy youth again, which\r\nthou badest me wish thee?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, in good sooth," said the red-bearded man; "I am the Sea-eagle of\r\nold days; and I have gotten my youth, and love therewithal, and somewhat\r\nto love moreover."\r\n\r\nTherewith he turned to the fairest of the damsels, and she was\r\nwhite-skinned and fragrant as the lily, rose-cheeked and slender, and the\r\nwind played with the long locks of her golden hair, which hung down below\r\nher knees; so he cast his arms about her and strained her to his bosom,\r\nand kissed her face many times, and she nothing loth, but caressing him\r\nwith lips and hand.  But the other two damsels stood by smiling and\r\njoyous: and they clapped their hands together and kissed each other for\r\njoy of the new lover; and at last fell to dancing and skipping about them\r\nlike young lambs in the meadows of Spring-tide.  But amongst them all,\r\nstood up Hallblithe leaning on his spear with smiling lips and knitted\r\nbrow; for he was pondering in his mind in what wise he might further his\r\nquest.\r\n\r\nBut after they had danced a while the Sea-eagle left his love that he had\r\nchosen and took a hand of either of the two damsels, and led them\r\ntripping up to Hallblithe, and cried out: "Choose thou, Raven\'s baby,\r\nwhich of these twain thou wilt have to thy mate; for scarcely shalt thou\r\nsee better or fairer."\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe looked on them proudly and sternly, and the black-haired\r\ndamsel hung down her head before him and said softly: "Nay, nay,\r\nsea-warrior; this one is too lovely to be our mate.  Sweeter love abides\r\nhim, and lips more longed for."\r\n\r\nThen stirred Hallblithe\'s heart within him and he said: "O Eagle of the\r\nSea, thou hast thy youth again: what then wilt thou do with it?  Wilt\r\nthou not weary for the moonlit main, and the washing of waves and the\r\ndashing of spray, and thy fellows all glistening with the brine?  Where\r\nnow shall be the alien shores before thee, and the landing for fame, and\r\ndeparture for the gain of goods?  Wilt thou forget the ship\'s black side,\r\nand the dripping of the windward oars, as the squall falleth on when the\r\nsun hath arisen, and the sail tuggeth hard on the sheet, and the ship\r\nlieth over and the lads shout against the whistle of the wind?  Has the\r\nspear fallen from thine hand, and hast thou buried the sword of thy\r\nfathers in the grave from which thy body hath escaped?  What art thou, O\r\nWarrior, in the land of the alien and the King?  Who shall heed thee or\r\ntell the tale of thy glory, which thou hast covered over with the hand of\r\na light woman, whom thy kindred knoweth not, and who was not born in a\r\nhouse wherefrom it hath been appointed thee from of old to take the\r\npleasure of woman?  Whose thrall art thou now, thou lifter of the spoil,\r\nthou scarer of the freeborn?  The bidding of what lord or King wilt thou\r\ndo, O Chieftain, that thou mayst eat thy meat in the morning and lie soft\r\nin thy bed in the evening?"\r\n\r\n"O Warrior of the Ravagers, here stand I, Hallblithe of the Raven, and I\r\nam come into an alien land beset with marvels to seek mine own, and find\r\nthat which is dearest to mine heart; to wit, my troth-plight maiden the\r\nHostage of the Rose, the fair woman who shall lie in my bed, and bear me\r\nchildren, and stand by me in field and fold, by thwart and gunwale,\r\nbefore the bow and the spear, by the flickering of the cooking-fire, and\r\namidst the blaze of the burning hall, and beside the bale-fire of the\r\nwarrior of the Raven.  O Sea-eagle, my guester amongst the foemen, my\r\nfellow-farer and shipmate, say now once for all whether thou wilt help me\r\nin my quest, or fall off from me as a dastard?"\r\n\r\nAgain the maidens shrank before his clear and high-raised voice, and they\r\ntrembled and grew pale.\r\n\r\nBut the Sea-eagle laughed from a countenance kind with joy, and said:\r\n"Child of the Raven, thy words are good and manly: but it availeth nought\r\nin this land, and I wot not how thou wilt fare, or why thou hast been\r\nsent amongst us.  What wilt thou do?  Hadst thou spoken these words to\r\nthe Long-hoary, the Grandfather, yesterday, his ears would have been deaf\r\nto them; and now that thou speakest them to the Sea-eagle, this joyous\r\nman on the Glittering Plain, he cannot do according to them, for there is\r\nno other land than this which can hold him.  Here he is strong and stark,\r\nand full of joy and love; but otherwhere he would be but a gibbering\r\nghost drifting down the wind of night.  Therefore in whatsoever thou\r\nmayst do within this land I will stand by thee and help thee; but not one\r\ninch beyond it may my foot go, whether it be down into the brine of the\r\nsea, or up into the clefts of the mountains which are the wall of this\r\ngoodly land.\r\n\r\n"Thou hast been my shipmate and I love thee, I am thy friend; but here in\r\nthis land must needs be the love and the friendship.  For no ghost can\r\nlove thee, no ghost may help thee.  And as to what thou sayest concerning\r\nthe days gone past and our joys upon the tumbling sea, true it is that\r\nthose days were good and lovely; but they are dead and gone like the lads\r\nwho sat on the thwart beside us, and the maidens who took our hands in\r\nthe hall to lead us to the chamber.  Other days have come in their stead,\r\nand other friends shall cherish us.  What then?  Shall we wound the\r\nliving to pleasure the dead, who cannot heed it?  Shall we curse the\r\nYuletide, and cast foul water on the Holy Hearth of the winter feast,\r\nbecause the summer once was fair and the days flit and the times change?\r\nNow let us be glad!  For life liveth."\r\n\r\nTherewith he turned about to his damsel and kissed her on the mouth.  But\r\nHallblithe\'s face was grown sad and stern, and he spake slowly and\r\nheavily: "So is it, shipmate, that whereas thou sayest that the days\r\nflit, for thee they shall flit no more; and the day may come for thee\r\nwhen thou shalt be weary, and know it, and long for the lost which thou\r\nhast forgotten.  But hereof it availeth nought for me to speak any\r\nlonger, for thine ears are deaf to these words, and thou wilt not hear\r\nthem.  Therefore I say no more save that I thank thee for thy help\r\nwhatsoever it may be; and I will take it, for the day\'s work lieth before\r\nme, and I begin to think that it may be heavy enough."\r\n\r\nThe women yet looked downcast, and as if they would be gone out of\r\nearshot; but the Sea-eagle laughed as one who is well content, and said:\r\n"Thou thyself wilt make it hard for thyself after the wont of thy proud\r\nand haughty race; but for me nothing is hard any longer; neither thy\r\nscorn nor thy forebodings of evil.  Be thou my friend as much as thou\r\ncanst, and I will be thine wholly.  Now ye women, whither will ye lead\r\nus?  For I am ready to see any new thing ye will show us."\r\n\r\nSaid his damsel: "We will take you to the King, that your hearts may be\r\nthe more gladdened.  And as for thy friend the Spearman, O Sea-warrior,\r\nlet not his heart be downcast.  Who wotteth but that these two desires,\r\nthe desire of his heart, and the desire of a heart for him, may not be\r\none and the same desire, so that he shall be fully satisfied?"  As she\r\nspoke she looked sidelong at Hallblithe, with shy and wheedling eyes; and\r\nhe wondered at her word, and a new hope sprang up in his heart that he\r\nwas presently to be brought face to face with the Hostage, and that this\r\nwas that love, sweeter than their love, which abode in him, and his heart\r\nbecame lighter, and his visage cleared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII: THEY LOOK ON THE KING OF THE GLITTERING PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now the women led them along up the stream, and Hallblithe went side\r\nby side by the Sea-eagle; but the women had become altogether merry\r\nagain, and played and ran about them as gamesome as young goats; and they\r\nwaded the shallows of the clear bright stream barefoot to wash their\r\nlimbs of the sea-brine, and strayed about the meadows, plucking the\r\nflowers and making them wreaths and chaplets, which they did upon\r\nthemselves and the Sea-eagle; but Hallblithe they touched not, for still\r\nthey feared him.  They went on as the stream led them up toward the\r\nhills, and ever were the meads about them as fair and flowery as might\r\nbe.  Folk they saw afar off, but fell in with none for a good while,\r\nsaving a man and a maid clad lightly as for mid-summer days, who were\r\nwandering together lovingly and happily by the stream-side, and who gazed\r\nwonderingly on the stark Sea-eagle, and on Hallblithe with his glittering\r\nspear.  The black-haired damsel greeted these twain and spake something\r\nto them, and they laughed merrily, and the man stooped down amongst the\r\ngrasses and blossoms of the bank, and drew forth a basket, and spread\r\ndainty victuals on the grass under a willow-tree, and bade them be his\r\nguests that fair afternoon.  So they sat down there above the glistering\r\nstream and ate and drank and were merry.  Thereafter the new-comers and\r\ntheir way-leaders departed with kind words, and still set their faces\r\ntowards the hills.\r\n\r\nAt last they saw before them a little wooded hill, and underneath it\r\nsomething red and shining, and other coloured things gleaming in the sun\r\nabout it.  Then said the Sea-eagle: "What have we yonder?"\r\n\r\nSaid his damsel: "That is the pavilion of the King; and about it are the\r\ntents and tilts of our folk who are of his fellowship: for oft he abideth\r\nin the fields with them, though he hath houses and halls as fair as the\r\nheart of man can conceive."\r\n\r\n"Hath he no foemen to fear?" said the Sea-eagle.\r\n\r\n"How should that be?" said the damsel.  "If perchance any came into this\r\nland to bring war upon him, their battle-anger should depart when once\r\nthe bliss of the Glittering Plain had entered into their souls, and they\r\nwould ask for nought but leave to abide here and be happy.  Yet I trow\r\nthat if he had foemen he could crush them as easily as I set my foot on\r\nthis daisy."\r\n\r\nSo as they went on they fell in with many folk, men and women, sporting\r\nand playing in the fields; and there was no semblance of eld on any of\r\nthem, and no scar or blemish or feebleness of body or sadness of\r\ncountenance; nor did any bear a weapon or any piece of armour.  Now some\r\nof them gathered about the new-corners, and wondered at Hallblithe and\r\nhis long spear and shining helm and dark grey byrny; but none asked\r\nconcerning them, for all knew that they were folk new come to the bliss\r\nof the Glittering Plain.  So they passed amidst these fair folk little\r\nhindered by them, and into Hallblithe\'s thoughts it came how joyous the\r\nfellowship of such should be and how his heart should be raised by the\r\nsight of them, if only his troth-plight maiden were by his side.\r\n\r\nThus then they came to the King\'s pavilion, where it stood in a bight of\r\nthe meadow-land at the foot of the hill, with the wood about it on three\r\nsides.  So fair a house Hallblithe deemed he had never seen; for it was\r\nwrought all over with histories and flowers, and with hems sewn with\r\ngold, and with orphreys of gold and pearl and gems.\r\n\r\nThere in the door of it sat the King of the Land in an ivory chair; he\r\nwas clad in golden gown, girt with a girdle of gems, and had his crown on\r\nhis head and his sword by his side.  For this was the hour wherein he\r\nheard what any of his folk would say to him, and for that very end he sat\r\nthere in the door of his tent, and folk were standing before him, and\r\nsitting and lying on the grass round about; and now one, now another,\r\ncame up to him and spoke before him.\r\n\r\nHis face shone like a star; it was exceeding beauteous, and as kind as\r\nthe even of May in the gardens of the happy, when the scent of the\r\neglantine fills all the air.  When he spoke his voice was so sweet that\r\nall hearts were ravished, and none might gainsay him.\r\n\r\nBut when Hallblithe set eyes on him, he knew at once that this was he\r\nwhose carven image he had seen in the Hall of the Ravagers, and his heart\r\nbeat fast, and he said to himself: "Hold up thine head now, O Son of the\r\nRaven, strengthen thine heart, and let no man or god cow thee.  For how\r\ncan thine heart change, which bade thee go to the house wherefrom it was\r\ndue to thee to take the pleasure of woman, and there to pledge thy faith\r\nand troth to her that loveth thee most, and hankereth for thee day by day\r\nand hour by hour, so that great is the love that we twain have builded\r\nup."\r\n\r\nNow they drew nigh, for folk fell back before them to the right and left,\r\nas before men who are new come and have much to do; so that there was\r\nnought between them and the face of the King.  But he smiled upon them so\r\nthat he cheered their hearts with the hope of fulfilment of their\r\ndesires, and he said: "Welcome, children!  Who be these whom ye have\r\nbrought hither for the increase of our joy?  Who is this tall,\r\nruddy-faced, joyous man so meet for the bliss of the Glittering Plain?\r\nAnd who is this goodly and lovely young man, who beareth weapons amidst\r\nour peace, and whose face is sad and stern beneath the gleaming of his\r\nhelm?"\r\n\r\nSaid the dark-haired damsel: "O King!  O Gift-giver and assurer of joy!\r\nthis tall one is he who was once oppressed by eld, and who hath come\r\nhither to thee from the Isle of Ransom, according to the custom of the\r\nland."\r\n\r\nSaid the King: "Tall man, it is well that thou art come.  Now are thy\r\ndays changed and thou yet alive.  For thee battle is ended, and therewith\r\nthe reward of battle, which the warrior remembereth not amidst the hard\r\nhand-play: peace hath begun, and thou needest not be careful for the\r\nendurance thereof: for in this land no man hath a lack which he may not\r\nsatisfy without taking aught from any other.  I deem not that thine heart\r\nmay conceive a desire which I shall not fulfil for thee, or crave a gift\r\nwhich I shall not give thee."\r\n\r\nThen the Sea-eagle laughed for joy, and turned his head this way and\r\nthat, so that he might the better take to him the smiles of all those\r\nthat stood around.\r\n\r\nThen the King said to Hallblithe: "Thou also art welcome; I know thee who\r\nthou art: meseemeth great joy awaiteth thee, and I will fulfil thy desire\r\nto the uttermost."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "O great King of a happy land, I ask of thee nought save\r\nthat which none shall withhold from me uncursed."\r\n\r\n"I will give it to thee," said the King, "and thou shalt bless me.  But\r\nwhat is it which thou wouldst?  What more canst thou have than the Gifts\r\nof the land?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "I came hither seeking no gifts, but to have mine own\r\nagain; and that is the bodily love of my troth-plight maiden.  They stole\r\nher from me, and me from her; for she loved me.  I went down to the sea-\r\nside and found her not, nor the ship which had borne her away.  I sailed\r\nfrom thence to the Isle of Ransom, for they told me that there I should\r\nbuy her for a price; neither was her body there.  But her image came to\r\nme in a dream of the night, and bade me seek to her hither.  Therefore, O\r\nKing, if she be here in the land, show me how I shall find her, and if\r\nshe be not here, show me how I may depart to seek her otherwhere.  This\r\nis all my asking."\r\n\r\nSaid the King: "Thy desire shall be satisfied; thou shalt have the woman\r\nwho would have thee, and whom thou shouldst have."\r\n\r\nHallblithe was gladdened beyond measure by that word; and now did the\r\nKing seem to him a comfort and a solace to every heart, even as he had\r\ndeemed of his carven image in the Hall of the Ravagers; and he thanked\r\nhim, and blessed him.\r\n\r\nBut the King bade him abide by him that night, and feast with him.  "And\r\non the morrow," said he, "thou shalt go thy ways to look on her whom thou\r\noughtest to love."\r\n\r\nTherewith was come the eventide and beginning of night, warm and fragrant\r\nand bright with the twinkling of stars, and they went into the King\'s\r\npavilion, and there was the feast as fair and dainty as might be; and\r\nHallblithe had meat from the King\'s own dish, and drink from his cup; but\r\nthe meat had no savour to him and the drink no delight, because of the\r\nlonging that possessed him.\r\n\r\nAnd when the feast was done, the damsels led Hallblithe to his bed in a\r\nfair tent strewn with gold about his head like the starry night, and he\r\nlay down and slept for sheer weariness of body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII: HALLBLITHE BEHOLDETH THE WOMAN WHO LOVETH HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on the morrow the men arose, and the Sea-eagle and his damsel came to\r\nHallblithe; for the other two damsels were departed, and the Sea-eagle\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n"Here am I well honoured and measurelessly happy; and I have a message\r\nfor thee from the King."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said Hallblithe; but he deemed that he knew what it would\r\nbe, and he reddened for the joy of his assured hope.\r\n\r\nSaid the Sea-eagle: "Joy to thee, O shipmate!  I am to take thee to the\r\nplace where thy beloved abideth, and there shalt thou see her, but not so\r\nas she can see thee; and thereafter shalt thou go to the King, that thou\r\nmayst tell him if she shall accomplish thy desire."\r\n\r\nThen was Hallblithe glad beyond measure, and his heart danced within him,\r\nand he deemed it but meet that the others should be so joyous and blithe\r\nwith him, for they led him along without any delay, and were glad at his\r\nrejoicing; and words failed him to tell of his gladness.\r\n\r\nBut as he went, the thoughts of his coming converse with his beloved\r\ncurled sweetly round his heart, so that scarce anything had seemed so\r\nsweet to him before; and he fell a-pondering what they twain, he and the\r\nHostage, should do when they came together again; whether they should\r\nabide on the Glittering Plain, or go back again to Cleveland by the Sea\r\nand dwell in the House of the Kindred; and for his part he yearned to\r\nbehold the roof of his fathers and to tread the meadow which his scythe\r\nhad swept, and the acres where his hook had smitten the wheat.  But he\r\nsaid to himself, "I will wait till I hear her desire hereon."\r\n\r\nNow they went into the wood at the back of the King\'s pavilion and\r\nthrough it, and so over the hill, and beyond it came into a land of hills\r\nand dales exceeding fair and lovely; and a river wound about the dales,\r\nlapping in turn the feet of one hill-side or the other; and in each dale\r\n(for they passed through two) was a goodly house of men, and tillage\r\nabout it, and vineyards and orchards.  They went all day till the sun was\r\nnear setting, and were not weary, for they turned into the houses by the\r\nway when they would, and had good welcome and meat and drink and what\r\nthey would of the folk that dwelt there.  Thus anigh sunset they came\r\ninto a dale fairer than either of the others, and nigh to the end where\r\nthey had entered it was an exceeding goodly house.  Then said the damsel:\r\n\r\n"We are nigh-hand to our journey\'s end; let us sit down on the grass by\r\nthis river-side whilst I tell thee the tale which the King would have\r\nthee know."\r\n\r\nSo they sat down on the grass beside the brimming river, scant two\r\nbowshots from that fair house, and the damsel said, reading from a scroll\r\nwhich she drew from her bosom:\r\n\r\n"O Spearman, in yonder house dwelleth the woman foredoomed to love thee:\r\nif thou wouldst see her, go thitherward, following the path which turneth\r\nfrom the river-side by yonder oak-tree, and thou shalt presently come to\r\na thicket of bay-trees at the edge of an apple-orchard, whose trees are\r\nblossoming; abide thou hidden by the bay-leaves, and thou shalt see\r\nmaidens come into the orchard, and at last one fairer than all the\r\nothers.  This shall be thy love fore-doomed, and none other; and thou\r\nshalt know her by this token, that when she hath set her down on the\r\ngrass beside the bay-tree, she shall say to her maidens \'Bring me now the\r\nbook wherein is the image of my beloved, that I may solace myself with\r\nbeholding it before the sun goes down and the night cometh.\'"\r\n\r\nNow Hallblithe was troubled when she read out these words, and he said:\r\n"What is this tale about a book?  I know not of any book that lieth\r\nbetwixt me and my beloved."\r\n\r\n"O Spearman," said the damsel, "I may tell thee no more, because I know\r\nno more.  But keep up thine heart!  For dost thou know any more than I do\r\nwhat hath befallen thy beloved since thou wert sundered from her? and why\r\nshould not this matter of the book be one of the things that hath\r\nbefallen her?  Go now with joy, and come again blessing us."\r\n\r\n"Yea, go, faring-fellow," said the Sea-eagle, "and come back joyful, that\r\nwe may all be merry together.  And we will abide thee here."\r\n\r\nHallblithe foreboded evil, but he held his peace and went his ways down\r\nthe path by the oak-tree; and they abode there by the water-side, and\r\nwere very merry talking of this and that (but no whit of Hallblithe), and\r\nkissing and caressing each other; so that it seemed but a little while to\r\nthem ere they saw Hallblithe coming back by the oak-tree.  He went\r\nslowly, hanging his head like a man sore-burdened with grief: thus he\r\ncame up to them, and stood there above them as they lay on the fragrant\r\ngrass, and he saying no word and looking so sad and sorry, and withal so\r\nfell, that they feared his grief and his anger, and would fain have been\r\naway from him; so that they durst not ask him a question for a long\r\nwhile, and the sun sank below the hill while they abided thus.\r\n\r\nThen all trembling the damsel spake to the Sea-eagle: "Speak to him, dear\r\nfriend, else must I flee away, for I fear his silence."\r\n\r\nQuoth the Sea-eagle: "Shipmate and friend, what hath betided?  How art\r\nthou?  May we hearken, and mayhappen amend it?"\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe cast himself adown on the grass and said: "I am accursed\r\nand beguiled; and I wander round and round in a tangle that I may not\r\nescape from.  I am not far from deeming that this is a land of dreams\r\nmade for my beguiling.  Or has the earth become so full of lies, that\r\nthere is no room amidst them for a true man to stand upon his feet and go\r\nhis ways?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Sea-eagle: "Thou shalt tell us of what hath betid, and so ease\r\nthe sorrow of thy soul if thou wilt.  Or if thou wilt, thou shalt nurse\r\nthy sorrow in thine heart and tell no man.  Do what thou wilt; am I not\r\nbecome thy friend?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "I will tell you twain the tidings, and thereafter ask\r\nme no more concerning them.  Hearken.  I went whereas ye bade me, and hid\r\nmyself in the bay-tree thicket; and there came maidens into the\r\nblossoming orchard and made a resting-place with silken cushions close to\r\nwhere I was lurking, and stood about as though they were looking for some\r\none to come.  In a little time came two more maidens, and betwixt them\r\none so much fairer than any there, that my heart sank within me: whereas\r\nI deemed because of her fairness that this would be the fore-doomed love\r\nwhereof ye spake, and lo, she was in nought like to my troth-plight\r\nmaiden, save that she was exceeding beauteous: nevertheless, heart-sick\r\nas I was, I determined to abide the token that ye told me of.  So she lay\r\ndown amidst those cushions, and I beheld her that she was sad of\r\ncountenance; and she was so near to me that I could see the tears welling\r\ninto her eyes, and running down her cheeks; so that I should have grieved\r\nsorely for her had I not been grieving so sorely for myself.  For\r\npresently she sat up and said \'O maiden, bring me hither the book wherein\r\nis the image of my beloved, that I may behold it in this season of sunset\r\nwherein I first beheld it; that I may fill my heart with the sight\r\nthereof before the sun is gone and the dark night come.\'\r\n\r\n"Then indeed my heart died within me when I wotted that this was the love\r\nwhereof the King spake, that he would give to me, and she not mine own\r\nbeloved, yet I could not choose but abide and look on a while, and she\r\nbeing one that any man might love beyond measure.  Now a maiden went away\r\ninto the house and came back again with a book covered with gold set with\r\ngems; and the fair woman took it and opened it, and I was so near to her\r\nthat I saw every leaf clearly as she turned the leaves.  And in that book\r\nwere pictures of many things, as flaming mountains, and castles of war,\r\nand ships upon the sea, but chiefly of fair women, and queens, and\r\nwarriors and kings; and it was done in gold and azure and cinnabar and\r\nminium.  So she turned the leaves, till she came to one whereon was\r\npictured none other than myself, and over against me was the image of\r\nmine own beloved, the Hostage of the Rose, as if she were alive, so that\r\nthe heart within me swelled with the sobbing which I must needs refrain,\r\nwhich grieved me like a sword-stroke.  Shame also took hold of me as the\r\nfair woman spoke to my painted image, and I lying well-nigh within touch\r\nof her hand; but she said: \'O my beloved, why dost thou delay to come to\r\nme?  For I deemed that this eve at least thou wouldst come, so many and\r\nstrong as are the meshes of love which we have cast about thy feet.  Oh\r\ncome to-morrow at the least and latest, or what shall I do, and wherewith\r\nshall I quench the grief of my heart?  Or else why am I the daughter of\r\nthe Undying King, the Lord of the Treasure of the Sea?  Why have they\r\nwrought new marvels for me, and compelled the Ravagers of the Coasts to\r\nserve me, and sent false dreams flitting on the wings of the night?  Yea,\r\nwhy is the earth fair and fruitful, and the heavens kind above it, if\r\nthou comest not to-night, nor to-morrow, nor the day after?  And I the\r\ndaughter of the Undying, on whom the days shall grow and grow as the\r\ngrains of sand which the wind heaps up above the sea-beach.  And life\r\nshall grow huger and more hideous round about the lonely one, like the\r\nling-worm laid upon the gold, that waxeth thereby, till it lies all\r\naround about the house of the queen entrapped, the moveless unending ring\r\nof the years that change not.\'\r\n\r\n"So she spake till the weeping ended her words, and I was all abashed\r\nwith shame and pale with anguish.  I stole quietly from my lair unheeded\r\nof any, save that one damsel said that a rabbit ran in the hedge, and\r\nanother that a blackbird stirred in the thicket.  Behold me, then, that\r\nmy quest beginneth again amidst the tangle of lies whereinto I have been\r\nentrapped."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV: HALLBLITHE HAS SPEECH WITH THE KING AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stood up when he had made an end, as a man ready for the road; but\r\nthey lay there downcast and abashed, and had no words to answer him.  For\r\nthe Sea-eagle was sorry that his faring-fellow was hapless, and was sorry\r\nthat he was sorry; and as for the damsel, she had not known but that she\r\nwas leading the goodly Spearman to the fulfilment of his heart\'s desire.\r\nAlbeit after a while she spake again and said:\r\n\r\n"Dear friends, day is gone and night is at hand; now to-night it were ill\r\nlodging at yonder house; and the next house on our backward road is over\r\nfar for wayworn folk.  But hard by through the thicket is a fair little\r\nwood-lawn, by the lip of a pool in the stream wherein we may bathe us to-\r\nmorrow morning; and it is grassy and flowery and sheltered from all winds\r\nthat blow, and I have victual enough in my wallet.  Let us sup and rest\r\nthere under the bare heaven, as oft is the wont of us in this land; and\r\non the morrow early we will arise and get us back again to Wood-end,\r\nwhere yet the King abideth, and there shalt thou talk to him again, O\r\nSpearman."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Take me whither ye will; but now nought availeth.  I am\r\na captive in a land of lies, and here most like shall I live betrayed and\r\ndie hapless."\r\n\r\n"Hold thy peace, dear friend, of such words as those last," said she, "or\r\nI must needs flee from thee, for they hurt me sorely.  Come now to this\r\npleasant place."\r\n\r\nShe took him by the hand and looked kindly on him, and the Sea-eagle\r\nfollowed him, murmuring an old song of the harvest-field, and they went\r\ntogether by a path through a thicket of white-thorn till they came unto a\r\ngrassy place.  There then they sat them down, and ate and drank what they\r\nwould, sitting by the lip of the pool till a waning moon was bright over\r\ntheir heads.  And Hallblithe made no semblance of content; but the Sea-\r\neagle and his damsel were grown merry again, and talked and sang together\r\nlike autumn stares, with the kissing and caressing of lovers.\r\n\r\nSo at last those twain lay down amongst the flowers, and slept in each\r\nother\'s arms; but Hallblithe betook him to the brake a little aloof, and\r\nlay down, but slept not till morning was at hand, when slumber and\r\nconfused dreams overtook him.\r\n\r\nHe was awaked from his sleep by the damsel, who came pushing through the\r\nthicket all fresh and rosy from the river, and roused him, and said:\r\n\r\n"Awake now, Spearman, that we may take our pleasure in the sun; for he is\r\nhigh in the heavens now, and all the land laughs beneath him."\r\n\r\nHer eyes glittered as she spoke, and her limbs moved under her raiment as\r\nthough she would presently fall to dancing for very joy.  But Hallblithe\r\narose wearily, and gave her back no smile in answer, but thrust through\r\nthe thicket to the water, and washed the night from off him, and so came\r\nback to the twain as they sat dallying together over their breakfast.  He\r\nwould not sit down by them, but ate a morsel of bread as he stood, and\r\nsaid: "Tell me how I can soonest find the King: I bid you not lead me\r\nthither, but let me go my ways alone.  For with me time presses, and with\r\nyou meseemeth time is nought.  Neither am I a meet fellow for the happy."\r\n\r\nBut the Sea-eagle sprang up, and swore with a great oath that he would\r\nnowise leave his shipmate in the lurch.  And the damsel said: "Fair man,\r\nI had best go with thee; I shall not hinder thee, but further thee\r\nrather, so that thou shalt make one day\'s journey of two."\r\n\r\nAnd she put forth her hand to him, and caressed him smiling, and fawned\r\nupon him, and he heeded it little, but hung not aback from them since\r\nthey were ready for the road: so they set forth all three together.\r\n\r\nThey made such diligence on the backward road that the sun was not set by\r\nthen they came to Wood-end; and there was the King sitting in the door of\r\nhis pavilion.  Thither went Hallblithe straight, and thrust through the\r\nthrong, and stood before the King; who greeted him kindly, and was no\r\nless sweet of face than on that other day.\r\n\r\nHallblithe hailed him not, but said: "King, look on my anguish, and if\r\nthou art other than a king of dreams and lies, play no longer with me,\r\nbut tell me straight out if thou knowest of my troth-plight maiden,\r\nwhether she is in this land or not."\r\n\r\nThen the King smiled on him and said: "True it is that I know of her; yet\r\nknow I not whether she is in this land or not."\r\n\r\n"King," said Hallblithe, "wilt thou bring us together and stay my heart\'s\r\nbleeding?"\r\n\r\nSaid the King: "I cannot, since I know not where she is."\r\n\r\n"Why didst thou lie to me the other day?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"I lied not," said the King; "I bade bring thee to the woman that loved\r\nthee, and whom thou shouldst love; and that is my daughter.  And look\r\nthou!  Even as I may not bring thee to thine earthly love, so couldst\r\nthou not make thyself manifest before my daughter, and become her\r\ndeathless love.  Is it not enough?"\r\n\r\nHe spake sternly for all that he smiled, and Hallblithe said: "O King,\r\nhave pity on me!"\r\n\r\n"Yea," said the King; "pity thee I do: but I will live despite thy\r\nsorrow; my pity of thee shall not slay me, or make thee happy.  Even in\r\nsuch wise didst thou pity my daughter."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Thou art mighty, O King, and maybe the mightiest.  Wilt\r\nthou not help me?"\r\n\r\n"How can I help thee?" said the King, "thou who wilt not help thyself.\r\nThou hast seen what thou shouldst do: do it then and be holpen."\r\n\r\nThen said Hallblithe: "Wilt thou not slay me, O King, since thou wilt not\r\ndo aught else?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the King, "thy slaying wilt not serve me nor mine: I will\r\nneither help nor hinder.  Thou art free to seek thy love wheresoever thou\r\nwilt in this my realm.  Depart in peace!"\r\n\r\nHallblithe saw that the King was angry, though he smiled upon him; yet so\r\ncoldly, that the face of him froze the very marrow of Hallblithe\'s bones:\r\nand he said within himself: "This King of lies shall not slay me, though\r\nmine anguish be hard to bear: for I am alive, and it may be that my love\r\nis in this land, and I may find her here, and how to reach another land I\r\nknow not."\r\n\r\nSo he turned from before the face of the King as the sun was setting, and\r\nhe went down the land southward betwixt the mountains and the sea, not\r\nheeding whether it were night or day; and he went on till it was long\r\npast midnight, and then for mere weariness laid him down under a tree,\r\nnot knowing where he was, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAnd in the morning he woke up to the bright sun, and found folk standing\r\nround about him, both men and women, and their sheep were anigh them, for\r\nthey were shepherd folk.  So when they saw that he was awake, they\r\ngreeted him, and were blithe with him and made much of him: and they took\r\nhim home to their house, and gave him to eat and to drink, and asked him\r\nwhat he would that they might serve him.  And they seemed to him to be\r\nkind and simple folk, and though he loathed to speak the words, so sick\r\nat heart he was, yet he told them how he was seeking his troth-plight\r\nmaiden, his earthly love, and asked them to say if they had seen any\r\nwoman like her.\r\n\r\nThey heard him kindly and pitied him, and told him how they had heard of\r\na woman in the land, who sought her beloved even as he sought his.  And\r\nwhen he heard that, his heart leapt up, and he asked them to tell him\r\nmore concerning this woman.  Then they said that she dwelt in the hill-\r\ncountry in a goodly house, and had set her heart on a lovely man, whose\r\nimage she had seen in a book, and that no man but this one would content\r\nher; and this, they said, was a sad and sorry matter, such as was unheard\r\nof hitherto in the land.\r\n\r\nSo when Hallblithe heard this, as heavily as his heart fell again, he\r\nchanged not countenance, but thanked the kind folk and departed, and went\r\non down the land betwixt the mountains and the sea, and before nightfall\r\nhe had been into three more houses of folk, and asked there of all comers\r\nconcerning a woman who was sundered from her beloved; and at none of them\r\ngat he any answer to make him less sorry than yesterday.  At the last of\r\nthe three he slept, and on the morrow early there was the work to begin\r\nagain; and the next day was the same as the last, and the day after\r\ndiffered not from it.  Thus he went on seeking his beloved betwixt the\r\nmountains and the plain, till the great rock-wall came down to the side\r\nof the sea and made an end of the Glittering Plain on that side.  Then he\r\nturned about and went back by the way he had come, and up the country\r\nbetwixt the mountains and the plain northward, until he had been into\r\nevery house of folk in those parts and asked his question.\r\n\r\nThen he went up into that fair country of the dales, and even anigh to\r\nwhere dwelt the King\'s Daughter, and otherwhere in the land and\r\neverywhere, quartering the realm of the Glittering Plain as the heron\r\nquarters the flooded meadow when the waters draw aback into the river.  So\r\nthat now all people knew him when he came, and they wondered at him; but\r\nwhen he came to any house for the third or fourth time, they wearied of\r\nhim, and were glad when he departed.\r\n\r\nEver it was one of two answers that he had: either folk said to him,\r\n"There is no such woman; this land is happy, and nought but happy people\r\ndwell herein;" or else they told him of the woman who lived in sorrow,\r\nand was ever looking on a book, that she might bring to her the man whom\r\nshe desired.\r\n\r\nWhiles he wearied and longed for death, but would not die until there was\r\nno corner of the land unsearched.  Whiles he shook off weariness, and\r\nwent about his quest as a craftsman sets about his work in the morning.\r\nWhiles it irked him to see the soft and merry folk of the land, who had\r\nno skill to help him, and he longed for the house of his fathers and the\r\nmen of the spear and the plough; and thought, "Oh, if I might but get me\r\nback, if it were but for an hour and to die there, to the meadows of the\r\nRaven, and the acres beneath the mountains of Cleveland by the Sea.  Then\r\nat least should I learn some tale of what is or what hath been, howsoever\r\nevil the tidings were, and not be bandied about by lies for ever."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV: YET HALLBLITHE SPEAKETH WITH THE KING\r\n\r\n\r\nSo wore the days and the moons; and now were some six moons worn since\r\nfirst he came to the Glittering Plain; and he was come to Wood-end again,\r\nand heard and knew that the King was sitting once more in the door of his\r\npavilion to hearken to the words of his people, and he said to himself:\r\n"I will speak yet again to this man, if indeed he be a man; yea, though\r\nhe turn me into stone."\r\n\r\nAnd he went up toward the pavilion; and on the way it came into his mind\r\nwhat the men of the kindred were doing that morning; and he had a vision\r\nof them as it were, and saw them yoking the oxen to the plough, and\r\nslowly going down the acres, as the shining iron drew the long furrow\r\ndown the stubble-land, and the light haze hung about the elm-trees in the\r\ncalm morning, and the smoke rose straight into the air from the roof of\r\nthe kindred.  And he said: "What is this? am I death-doomed this morning\r\nthat this sight cometh so clearly upon me amidst the falseness of this\r\nunchanging land?"\r\n\r\nThus he came to the pavilion, and folk fell back before him to the right\r\nand the left, and he stood before the King, and said to him: "I cannot\r\nfind her; she is not in thy land."\r\n\r\nThen spake the King, smiling upon him, as erst: "What wilt thou then?  Is\r\nit not time to rest?"\r\n\r\nHe said: "Yea, O King; but not in this land."\r\n\r\nSaid the King: "Where else than in this land wilt thou find rest?  Without\r\nis battle and famine, longing unsatisfied, and heart-burning and fear;\r\nwithin it is plenty and peace and good will and pleasure without cease.\r\nThy word hath no meaning to me."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Give me leave to depart, and I will bless thee."\r\n\r\n"Is there nought else to do?" said the King.\r\n\r\n"Nought else," said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\nTherewith he felt that the King\'s face changed though he still smiled on\r\nhim, and again he felt his heart grow cold before the King.\r\n\r\nBut the King spake and said: "I hinder not thy departure, nor will any of\r\nmy folk.  No hand will be raised against thee; there is no weapon in all\r\nthe land, save the deedless sword by my side and the weapons which thou\r\nbearest."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Dost thou not owe me a joy in return for my beguiling?"\r\n\r\n"Yea," said the King, "reach out thine hand to take it."\r\n\r\n"One thing only may I take of thee," said Hallblithe; "my troth-plight\r\nmaiden or else the speeding of my departure."\r\n\r\nThen said the King, and his voice was terrible though yet he smiled: "I\r\nwill not hinder; I will not help.  Depart in peace!"\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe turned away dizzy and half fainting, and strayed down the\r\nfield, scarce knowing where he was; and as he went he felt his sleeve\r\nplucked at, and turned about, and lo! he was face to face with the Sea-\r\neagle, no less joyous than aforetime.  He took Hallblithe in his arms and\r\nembraced him and kissed him, and said: "Well met, faring-fellow!  Whither\r\naway?"\r\n\r\n"Away out of this land of lies," said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\nThe Sea-eagle shook his head, and quoth he: "Art thou still seeking a\r\ndream?  And thou so fair that thou puttest all other men to shame."\r\n\r\n"I seek no dream," said Hallblithe, "but rather the end of dreams."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Sea-eagle, "we will not wrangle about it.  But hearken.\r\nHard by in a pleasant nook of the meadows have I set up my tent; and\r\nalthough it be not as big as the King\'s pavilion, yet is it fair enough.\r\nWilt thou not come thither with me and rest thee to-night; and to-morrow\r\nwe will talk of this matter?"\r\n\r\nNow Hallblithe was weary and confused, and downhearted beyond his wont,\r\nand the friendly words of the Sea-eagle softened his heart, and he smiled\r\non him and said: "I give thee thanks; I will come with thee: thou art\r\nkind, and hast done nought to me save good from the time when I first saw\r\nthee lying in thy bed in the Hall of the Ravagers.  Dost thou remember\r\nthe day?"\r\n\r\nThe Sea-eagle knitted his brow as one striving with a troublous memory,\r\nand said: "But dimly, friend, as if it had passed in an ugly dream:\r\nmeseemeth my friendship with thee began when I came to thee from out of\r\nthe wood, and saw thee standing with those three damsels; that I remember\r\nfull well ye were fair to look on."\r\n\r\nHallblithe wondered at his words, but said no more about it, and they\r\nwent together to a flowery nook nigh a stream of clear water where stood\r\na silken tent, green like the grass which it stood on, and flecked with\r\ngold and goodly colours.  Nigh it on the grass lay the Sea-eagle\'s\r\ndamsel, ruddy-cheeked and sweet-lipped, as fair as aforetime.  She turned\r\nabout when she heard men coming, and when she saw Hallblithe a smile came\r\ninto her face like the sun breaking out on a fair but clouded morning,\r\nand she went up to him and took him by the hands and kissed his cheek,\r\nand said: "Welcome, Spearman! welcome back!  We have heard of thee in\r\nmany places, and have been sorry that thou wert not glad, and now are we\r\nfain of thy returning.  Shall not sweet life begin for thee from\r\nhenceforward?"\r\n\r\nAgain was Hallblithe moved by her kind welcome; but he shook his head and\r\nspake: "Thou art kind, sister; yet if thou wouldst be kinder thou wilt\r\nshow me a way whereby I may escape from this land.  For abiding here has\r\nbecome irksome to me, and meseemeth that hope is yet alive without the\r\nGlittering Plain."\r\n\r\nHer face fell as she answered: "Yea, and fear also, and worse, if aught\r\nbe worse.  But come, let us eat and drink in this fair place, and gather\r\nfor thee a little joyance before thou departest, if thou needs must\r\ndepart."\r\n\r\nHe smiled on her as one not ill-content, and laid himself down on the\r\ngrass, while the twain busied themselves, and brought forth fair cushions\r\nand a gilded table, and laid dainty victual thereon and good wine.\r\n\r\nSo they ate and drank together, and the Sea-eagle and his mate became\r\nvery joyous again, and Hallblithe bestirred himself not to be a\r\nmar-feast; for he said within himself: "I am departing, and after this\r\ntime I shall see them no more; and they are kind and blithe with me, and\r\nhave been aforetime; I will not make their merry hearts sore.  For when I\r\nam gone I shall be remembered of them but a little while."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI: THOSE THREE GO THEIR WAYS TO THE EDGE OF THE GLITTERING\r\nPLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the evening wore merrily; and they made Hallblithe lie in an ingle of\r\nthe tent on a fair bed, and he was weary, and slept thereon like a child.\r\nBut in the morning early they waked him; and while they were breaking\r\ntheir fast they began to speak to him of his departure, and asked him if\r\nhe had an inkling of the way whereby he should get him gone, and he said:\r\n"If I escape it must needs be by way of the mountains that wall the land\r\nabout till they come down to the sea.  For on the sea is no ship and no\r\nhaven; and well I wot that no man of the land durst or can ferry me over\r\nto the land of my kindred, or otherwhere without the Glittering Plain.\r\nTell me therefore (and I ask no more of you), is there any rumour or\r\nmemory of a way that cleaveth yonder mighty wall of rock to other lands?"\r\n\r\nSaid the damsel: "There is more than a memory or a rumour: there is a\r\nroad through the mountains known to all men.  For at whiles the earthly\r\npilgrims come into the Glittering Plain thereby; and yet but seldom, so\r\nmany are the griefs and perils which beset the wayfarers on that road.\r\nWhereof thou hadst far better bethink thee in time, and abide here and be\r\nhappy with us and others who long sore to make thee happy."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Hallblithe, "there is nought to do but tell me of the way,\r\nand I will depart at once, blessing you."\r\n\r\nSaid the Sea-eagle: "More than that at least will we do.  May I lose the\r\nbliss whereto I have attained, if I go not with thee to the very edge of\r\nthe land of the Glittering Plain.  Shall it not be so, sweetheart?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, at least we may do that," said the damsel; and she hung her head as\r\nif she were ashamed, and said: "And that is all that thou wilt get from\r\nus at most."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "It is enough, and I asked not so much."\r\n\r\nThen the damsel busied herself, and set meat and drink in two wallets,\r\nand took one herself and gave the other to the Sea-eagle, and said: "We\r\nwill be thy porters, O Spearman, and will give thee a full wallet from\r\nthe last house by the Desert of Dread, for when thou hast entered\r\ntherein, thou mayst well find victual hard to come by: and now let us\r\nlinger no more since the road is dear to thee."\r\n\r\nSo they set forth on foot, for in that land men were slow to feel\r\nweariness; and turning about the hill of Wood-end, they passed by some\r\nbroken country, and came at even to a house at the entrance of a long\r\nvalley, with high and steeply-sloping sides, which seemed, as it were, to\r\ncleave the dale country wherein they had fared aforetime.  At that house\r\nthey slept well-guested by its folk, and the next morning took their way\r\ndown the valley, and the folk of the house stood at the door to watch\r\ntheir departure; for they had told the wayfarers that they had fared but\r\na little way thitherward and knew of no folk who had used that road.\r\n\r\nSo those three fared down the valley southward all day, ever mounting\r\nhigher as they went.  The way was pleasant and easy, for they went over\r\nfair, smooth, grassy lawns betwixt the hill-sides, beside a clear\r\nrattling stream that ran northward; at whiles were clumps of tall trees,\r\noak for the most part, and at whiles thickets of thorn and eglantine and\r\nother such trees: so that they could rest well shaded when they would.\r\n\r\nThey passed by no house of men, nor came to any such in the even, but lay\r\ndown to sleep in a thicket of thorn and eglantine, and rested well, and\r\non the morrow they rose up betimes and went on their ways.\r\n\r\nThis second day as they went, the hill-sides on either hand grew lower,\r\ntill at last they died out into a wide plain, beyond which in the\r\nsouthern offing the mountains rose huge and bare.  This plain also was\r\ngrassy and beset with trees and thickets here and there.  Hereon they saw\r\nwild deer enough, as hart and buck, and roebuck and swine: withal a lion\r\ncame out of a brake hard by them as they went, and stood gazing on them,\r\nso that Hallblithe looked to his weapons, and the Sea-eagle took up a big\r\nstone to fight with, being weaponless; but the damsel laughed, and\r\ntripped on her way lightly with girt-up gown, and the beast gave no more\r\nheed to them.\r\n\r\nEasy and smooth was their way over this pleasant wilderness, and clear to\r\nsee, though but little used, and before nightfall, after they had gone a\r\nlong way, they came to a house.  It was not large nor high, but was built\r\nvery strongly and fairly of good ashlar: its door was shut, and on the\r\njamb thereof hung a slug-horn.  The damsel, who seemed to know what to\r\ndo, set her mouth to the horn, and blew a blast; and in a little while\r\nthe door was opened, and a big man clad in red scarlet stood therein: he\r\nhad no weapons, but was somewhat surly of aspect: he spake not, but stood\r\nabiding the word: so the damsel took it up and said: "Art thou not the\r\nWarden of the Uttermost House?"\r\n\r\nHe said: "I am."\r\n\r\nSaid the damsel: "May we guest here to-night?"\r\n\r\nHe said: "The house lieth open to you with all that it hath of victual\r\nand plenishing: take what ye will, and use what ye will."\r\n\r\nThey thanked him; but he heeded not their thanks, and withdrew him from\r\nthem.  So they entered and found the table laid in a fair hall of stone\r\ncarven and painted very goodly; so they ate and drank therein, and\r\nHallblithe was of good heart, and the Sea-eagle and his mate were merry,\r\nthough they looked softly and shyly on Hallblithe because of the\r\nsundering anigh; and they saw no man in the house save the man in\r\nscarlet, who went and came about his business, paying no heed to them.  So\r\nwhen the night was deep they lay down in the shut-bed off the hall, and\r\nslept, and the hours were tidingless to them until they woke in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow they arose and broke their fast, and thereafter the damsel\r\nspake to the man in scarlet and said: "May we fill our wallets with\r\nvictual for the way?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Warden: "There lieth the meat."\r\n\r\nSo they filled their wallets, while the man looked on; and they came to\r\nthe door when they were ready, and he unlocked it to them, saying no\r\nword.  But when they turned their faces towards the mountains he spake at\r\nlast, and stayed them at the first step.  Quoth he: "Whither away?  Ye\r\ntake the wrong road!"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Nay, for we go toward the mountains and the edge of the\r\nGlittering Plain."\r\n\r\n"Ye shall do ill to go thither," said the Warden, "and I bid you\r\nforbear."\r\n\r\n"O Warden of the Uttermost House, wherefore should we forbear?" said the\r\nSea-eagle.\r\n\r\nSaid the scarlet man: "Because my charge is to further those who would go\r\ninward to the King, and to stay those who would go outward from the\r\nKing."\r\n\r\n"How then if we go outward despite thy bidding?" said the Sea-eagle,\r\n"wilt thou then hinder us perforce?"\r\n\r\n"How may I," said the man, "since thy fellow hath weapons?"\r\n\r\n"Go we forth, then," said the Sea-eagle.\r\n\r\n"Yea," said the damsel, "we will go forth.  And know, O Warden, that this\r\nweaponed man only is of mind to fare over the edge of the Glittering\r\nPlain; but we twain shall come back hither again, and fare inwards."\r\n\r\nSaid the Warden: "Nought is it to me what ye will do when you are past\r\nthis house.  Nor shall any man who goeth out of this garth toward the\r\nmountains ever come back inwards save he cometh in the company of new-\r\ncorners to the Glittering Plain."\r\n\r\n"Who shall hinder him?" said the Sea-eagle.\r\n\r\n"The KING," said the Warden.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence awhile, and the man said:\r\n\r\n"Now do as ye will."  And therewith he turned back into the house and\r\nshut the door.\r\n\r\nBut the Sea-eagle and the damsel stood gazing on one another, and at\r\nHallblithe; and the damsel was downcast and pale; but the Sea-eagle cried\r\nout:\r\n\r\n"Forward now, O Hallblithe, since thou willest it, and we will go with\r\nthee and share whatever may befall thee; yea, right up to the very edge\r\nof the Glittering Plain.  And thou, O beloved, why dost thou delay?  Why\r\ndost thou stand as if thy fair feet were grown to the grass?"\r\n\r\nBut the damsel gave a lamentable cry, and cast herself down on the\r\nground, and knelt before the Sea-eagle, and took him by the knees, and\r\nsaid betwixt sobbing and weeping: "O my lord and love, I pray thee to\r\nforbear, and the Spearman, our friend, shall pardon us.  For if thou\r\ngoest, I shall never see thee more, since my heart will not serve me to\r\ngo with thee.  O forbear!  I pray thee!"\r\n\r\nAnd she grovelled on the earth before him; and the Sea-eagle waxed red,\r\nand would have spoken but Hallblithe cut his speech across, and said\r\n"Friends, be at peace!  For this is the minute that sunders us.  Get ye\r\nback at once to the heart of the Glittering Plain, and live there and be\r\nhappy; and take my blessing and thanks for the love and help that ye have\r\ngiven me.  For your going forward with me should destroy you and profit\r\nme nothing.  It would be but as the host bringing his guests one field\r\nbeyond his garth, when their goal is the ends of the earth; and if there\r\nwere a lion in the path, why should he perish for courtesy\'s sake?"\r\n\r\nTherewith he stooped down to the damsel, and lifted her up and kissed her\r\nface; and he cast his arms about the Sea-eagle and said to him:\r\n"Farewell, shipmate!"\r\n\r\nThen the damsel gave him the wallet of victual, and bade him farewell,\r\nweeping sorely; and he looked kindly on them for a moment of time, and\r\nthen turned away from them and fared on toward the mountains, striding\r\nwith great strides, holding his head aloft.  But they looked no more on\r\nhim, having no will to eke their sorrow, but went their ways back again\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII: HALLBLITHE AMONGST THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo strode on Hallblithe; but when he had gone but a little way his head\r\nturned, and the earth and heavens wavered before him, so that he must\r\nneeds sit down on a stone by the wayside, wondering what ailed him.  Then\r\nhe looked up at the mountains, which now seemed quite near to him at the\r\nplain\'s ending, and his weakness increased on him; and lo! as he looked,\r\nit was to him as if the crags rose up in the sky to meet him and overhang\r\nhim, and as if the earth heaved up beneath him, and therewith he fell\r\naback and lost all sense, so that he knew not what was become of the\r\nearth and the heavens and the passing of the minutes of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to himself he knew not whether he had lain so a great while\r\nor a little; he felt feeble, and for a while he lay scarce moving, and\r\nbeholding nought, not even the sky above him.  Presently he turned about\r\nand saw hard stone on either side, so he rose wearily and stood upon his\r\nfeet, and knew that he was faint with hunger and thirst.  Then he looked\r\naround him, and saw that he was in a narrow valley or cleft of the\r\nmountains amidst wan rocks, bare and waterless, where grew no blade of\r\ngreen; but he could see no further than the sides of that cleft, and he\r\nlonged to be out of it that he might see whitherward to turn.  Then he\r\nbethought him of his wallet, and set his hand to it and opened it,\r\nthinking to get victual thence; but lo! it was all spoilt and wasted.\r\nNone the less, for all his feebleness, he turned and went toiling slowly\r\nalong what seemed to be a path little trodden leading upward out of the\r\ncleft; and at last he reached the crest thereof, and sat him down on a\r\nrock on the other side; yet durst not raise his eyes awhile and look on\r\nthe land, lest he should see death manifest therein.  At last he looked,\r\nand saw that he was high up amongst the mountain-peaks: before him and on\r\neither hand was but a world of fallow stone rising ridge upon ridge like\r\nthe waves of the wildest of the winter sea.  The sun not far from its\r\nmidmost shone down bright and hot on that wilderness; yet was there no\r\nsign that any man had ever been there since the beginning of the world,\r\nsave that the path aforesaid seemed to lead onward down the stony slope.\r\n\r\nThis way and that way and all about he gazed, straining his eyes if\r\nperchance he might see any diversity in the stony waste; and at last\r\nbetwixt two peaks of the rock-wall on his left hand he descried a streak\r\nof green mingling with the cold blue of the distance; and he thought in\r\nhis heart that this was the last he should see of the Glittering Plain.\r\nThen he spake aloud in that desert, and said, though there was none to\r\nhear: "Now is my last hour come; and here is Hallblithe of the Raven\r\nperishing, with his deeds undone and his longing unfulfilled, and his\r\nbridal-bed acold for ever.  Long may the House of the Raven abide and\r\nflourish, with many a man and maiden, valiant and fair and fruitful!  O\r\nkindred, cast thy blessing on this man about to die here, doing none\r\notherwise than ye would have him!"\r\n\r\nHe sat there a little while longer, and then he said to himself: "Death\r\ntarries; were it not well that I go to meet him, even as the cot-carle\r\npreventeth the mighty chieftain?"\r\n\r\nThen he arose, and went painfully down the slope, steadying himself with\r\nthe shaft of his gleaming spear; but all at once he stopped; for it\r\nseemed to him that he heard voices borne on the wind that blew up the\r\nmountain-side.  But he shook his head and said: "Now forsooth beginneth\r\nthe dream which shall last for ever; nowise am I beguiled by it."  None\r\nthe less he strove the more eagerly with the wind and the way and his\r\nfeebleness; yet did the weakness wax on him, so that it was but a little\r\nwhile ere he faltered and reeled and fell down once more in a swoon.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to himself again he was no longer alone: a man was kneeling\r\ndown by him and holding up his head, while another before him, as he\r\nopened his eyes, put a cup of wine to his lips.  So Hallblithe drank and\r\nwas refreshed; and presently they gave him bread, and he ate, and his\r\nheart was strengthened, and the happiness of life returned to it, and he\r\nlay back, and slept sweetly for a season.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke from that slumber he found that he had gotten back much of\r\nhis strength again, and he sat up and looked around him, and saw three\r\nmen sitting anigh, armed and girt with swords, yet in evil array, and\r\nsore travel-worn.  One of these was very old, with long white hair\r\nhanging down; and another, though he was not so much stricken in years,\r\nstill looked an old man of over sixty winters.  The third was a man some\r\nforty years old, but sad and sorry and drooping of aspect.\r\n\r\nSo when they saw him stirring, they all fixed their eyes upon him, and\r\nthe oldest man said: "Welcome to him who erst had no tidings for us!"  And\r\nthe second said: "Tell us now thy tidings."  But the third, the sorry\r\nman, cried out aloud, saying: "Where is the Land?  Where is the Land?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Meseemeth the land which ye seek is the land which I\r\nseek to flee from.  And now I will not hide that meseemeth I have seen\r\nyou before, and that was at Cleveland by the Sea when the days were\r\nhappier."\r\n\r\nThen they all three bowed their heads in yea-say, and spake: "\'Where is\r\nthe Land?  Where is the Land?"\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe arose to his feet, and said: "Ye have healed me of the\r\nsickness of death, and I will do what I may to heal you of your sickness\r\nof sorrow.  Come up the pass with me, and I will show you the land afar\r\noff."\r\n\r\nThen they arose like young and brisk men, and he led them over the brow\r\nof the ridge into the little valley wherein he had first come to himself:\r\nthere he showed them that glimpse of a green land betwixt the two peaks,\r\nwhich he had beheld e\'en now; and they stood a while looking at it and\r\nweeping for joy.\r\n\r\nThen spake the oldest of the seekers: "Show us the way to the land."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Hallblithe, "I may not; for when I would depart thence, I\r\nmight not go by mine own will, but was borne out hither, I wot not how.\r\nFor when I came to the edge of the land against the will of the King, he\r\nsmote me, and then cast me out.  Therefore since I may not help you, find\r\nye the land for yourselves, and let me go blessing you, and come out of\r\nthis desert by the way whereby ye entered it.  For I have an errand in\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\nSpake the youngest of the seekers: "Now art thou become the yoke-fellow\r\nof Sorrow, and thou must wend, not whither thou wouldst, but whither she\r\nwill: and she would have thee go forward toward life, not backward toward\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nSaid the midmost seeker: "If we let thee go further into the wilderness\r\nthou shalt surely die: for hence to the peopled parts, and the City of\r\nMerchants, whence we come, is a month\'s journey: and there is neither\r\nmeat nor drink, nor beast nor bird, nor any green thing all that way; and\r\nsince we have found thee famishing, we may well deem that thou hast no\r\nvictual.  As to us we have but little; so that if it be much more than\r\nthree days\' journey to the Glittering Plain, we may well starve and die\r\nwithin sight of the Acre of the Undying.  Nevertheless that little will\r\nwe share with thee if thou wilt help us to find that good land; so that\r\nthou mayst yet put away Sorrow, and take Joy again to thy board and bed."\r\n\r\nHallblithe hung his head and answered nought; for he was confused by the\r\nmeshes of ill-hap, and his soul grew sick with the bitterness of death.\r\nBut the sad man spake again and said: "Thou hast an errand sayest thou?\r\nis it such as a dead man may do?"\r\n\r\nHallblithe pondered, and amidst the anguish of his despair was borne in\r\non him a vision of the sea-waves lapping the side of a black ship, and a\r\nman therein: who but himself, set free to do his errand, and his heart\r\nwas quickened within him, and he said: "I thank you, and I will wend back\r\nwith you, since there is no road for me save back again into the trap."\r\n\r\nThe three seekers seemed glad thereat, and the second one said: "Though\r\ndeath is pursuing, and life lieth ahead, yet will we not hasten thee\r\nunduly.  Time was when I was Captain of the Host, and learned how battles\r\nwere lost by lack of rest.  Therefore have thy sleep now, that thou mayst\r\nwax in strength for our helping."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "I need not rest; I may not rest; I will not rest."\r\n\r\nSaid the sad man: "It is lawful for thee to rest.  So say I, who was once\r\na master of law."\r\n\r\nSaid the long-hoary elder: "And I command thee to rest; I who was once\r\nthe king of a mighty folk."\r\n\r\nIn sooth Hallblithe was now exceeding weary; so he laid him down and\r\nslept sweetly in the stony wilderness amidst those three seekers, the\r\nold, the sad, and the very old.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke he felt well and strong again, and he leapt to his feet and\r\nlooked about him, and saw the three seekers stirring, and he deemed by\r\nthe sun that it was early morning.  The sad man brought forth bread and\r\nwater and wine, and they broke their fast; and when they had done he\r\nspake and said: "Abideth now in wallet and bottle but one more full meal\r\nfor us, and then no more save a few crumbs and a drop or two of wine if\r\nwe husband it well."\r\n\r\nSaid the second elder: "Get we to the road, then, and make haste.  I have\r\nbeen seeking, and meseemeth, though the way be long, it is not utterly\r\nblind for us.  Or look thou, Raven-son, is there not a path yonder that\r\nleadeth onward up to the brow of the ghyll again? and as I have seen, it\r\nleadeth on again down from the said brow."\r\n\r\nForsooth there was a track that led through the stony tangle of the\r\nwilderness; so they took to the road with a good heart, and went all day,\r\nand saw no living thing, and not a blade of grass or a trickle of water:\r\nnought save the wan rocks under the sun; and though they trusted in their\r\nroad that it led them aright, they saw no other glimpse of the Glittering\r\nPlain, because there rose a great ridge like a wall on the north side,\r\nand they went as it were down along a trench of the rocks, albeit it was\r\nwhiles broken across by ghylls, and knolls, and reefs.\r\n\r\nSo at sunset they rested and ate their victual, for they were very weary;\r\nand thereafter they lay down, and slept as soundly as if they were in the\r\nbest of the halls of men.  On the morrow betimes they arose soberly and\r\nwent their ways with few words, and, as they deemed, the path still led\r\nthem onward.  And now the great ridge on the north rose steeper and\r\nsteeper, and their crossing it seemed not to be thought of; but their\r\nhalf-blind track failed them not.  They rested at even, and ate and drank\r\nwhat little they had left, save a mouthful or two of wine, and then went\r\non again by the light of the moon, which was so bright that they still\r\nsaw their way.  And it happened to Hallblithe, as mostly it does with men\r\nvery travel-worn, that he went on and on scarce remembering where he was,\r\nor who his fellows were, or that he had any fellows.\r\n\r\nSo at midnight they lay down in the wilderness again, hungry and weary.\r\nThey rose at dawn and went forward with waning hope: for now the mountain\r\nridge on the north was close to their path, rising up along a sheer wall\r\nof pale stone over which nothing might go save the fowl flying; so that\r\nat first on that morning they looked for nothing save to lay their bones\r\nin that grievous desert where no man should find them.\r\n\r\nBut, as beset with famine, they fared on heavily down the narrow track,\r\nthere came a hoarse cry from Hallblithe\'s dry throat and it was as if his\r\ncry had been answered by another like to his; and the seekers turned and\r\nbeheld him pointing to the cliff-side, and lo! half-way up the pale sun-\r\nlitten crag stood two ravens in a cranny of the stone, flapping their\r\nwings and croaking, with thrusting forth and twisting of their heads; and\r\npresently they came floating on the thin pure air high up over the heads\r\nof the wayfarers, croaking for the pleasure of the meeting, as though\r\nthey laughed thereat.\r\n\r\nThen rose the heart of Hallblithe, and he smote his palms together, and\r\nfell to singing an old song of his people, amidst the rocks whereas few\r\nmen had sung aforetime.\r\n\r\n   Whence are ye and whither, O fowl of our fathers?\r\n   What field have ye looked on, what acres unshorn?\r\n   What land have ye left where the battle-folk gathers,\r\n   And the war-helms are white o\'er the paths of the corn?\r\n\r\n   What tale do ye bear of the people uncraven,\r\n   Where amidst the long hall-shadow sparkle the spears;\r\n   Where aloft on the hall-ridge now flappeth the raven,\r\n   And singeth the song of the nourishing years?\r\n\r\n   There gather the lads in the first of the morning,\r\n   While white lies the battle-day\'s dew on the grass,\r\n   And the kind steeds trot up to the horn\'s voice of warning,\r\n   And the winds wake and whine in the dusk of the pass.\r\n\r\n   O fowl of our fathers, why now are ye resting?\r\n   Come over the mountains and look on the foe.\r\n   Full fair after fight won shall yet be your nesting;\r\n   And your fledglings the sons of the kindred shall know.\r\n\r\nTherewith he strode with his head upraised, and above him flew the\r\nravens, croaking as if they answered his song in friendly fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was but a little after this that the path turned aside sharp toward\r\nthe cliffs, and the seekers were abashed thereof, till Hallblithe running\r\nforward beheld a great cavern in the face of the cliff at the path\'s\r\nending: so he turned and cried on his fellows, and they hastened up, and\r\npresently stood before that cavern\'s mouth with doubt and joy mingled in\r\ntheir minds; for now, mayhappen, they had reached the gate of the\r\nGlittering Plain, or mayhappen the gate of death.\r\n\r\nThe sad man hung his head and spake: "Doth not some new trap abide us?\r\nWhat do we here? is this aught save death?"\r\n\r\nSpake the Elder of Elders: "Was not death on either hand e\'en now, even\r\nas treason besetteth the king upon his throne?"\r\n\r\nAnd the second said: "Yea, we were as the host which hath no road save\r\nthrough the multitude of foe-men."\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe laughed and said: "Why do ye hang back, then?  As for me,\r\nif death be here, soon is mine errand sped."  Therewith he led the way\r\ninto the dark of the cave, and the ravens hung about the crag overhead\r\ncroaking, as the men left the light.\r\n\r\nSo was their way swallowed up in the cavern, and day and its time became\r\nnought to them; they went on and on, and became exceeding faint and\r\nweary, but rested not, for death was behind them.  Whiles they deemed\r\nthey heard waters running, and whiles the singing of fowl; and to\r\nHallblithe it seemed that he heard his name called, so that he shouted\r\nback in answer; but all was still when the sound of his voice had died\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAt last, when they were pressing on again after a short while of resting,\r\nHallblithe cried out that the cave was lightening: so they hastened\r\nonward, and the light grew till they could dimly see each other, and\r\ndimly they beheld the cave that it was both wide and high.  Yet a little\r\nfurther, and their faces showed white to one another, and they could see\r\nthe crannies of the rocks, and the bats hanging garlanded from the roof.\r\nSo then they came to where the day streamed down bright on them from a\r\nbreak overhead, and lo! the sky and green leaves waving against it.\r\n\r\nTo those way-worn men it seemed hard to clamber out that way, and\r\nespecially to the elders: so they went on a little further to see if\r\nthere were aught better abiding them, but when they found the daylight\r\nfailing them again, they turned back to the place of the break in the\r\nroof, lest they should waste their strength and perish in the bowels of\r\nthe mountain.  So with much ado they hove up Hallblithe till he got him\r\nfirst on to a ledge of the rocky wall, and so, what by strength, what by\r\ncunning, into the daylight through the rent in the roof.  So when he was\r\nwithout he made a rope of his girdle and strips from his raiment, for he\r\nwas ever a deft craftsman, and made a shift to heave up therewith the sad\r\nman, who was light and lithe of body; and then the two together dealt\r\nwith the elders one after another, till they were all four on the face of\r\nthe earth again.\r\n\r\nThe place whereto they had gotten was the side of a huge mountain, stony\r\nand steep, but set about with bushes, which seemed full fair to those\r\nwanderers amongst the rocks.  This mountain-slope went down towards a\r\nfair green plain, which Hallblithe made no doubt was the outlying waste\r\nof the Glittering Plain: nay, he deemed that he could see afar off\r\nthereon the white walls of the Uttermost House.  So much he told the\r\nseekers in few words; and then while they grovelled on the earth and wept\r\nfor pure joy, whereas the sun was down and it was beginning to grow dusk,\r\nhe went and looked around soberly to see if he might find water and any\r\nkind of victual; and presently a little down the hillside he came upon a\r\nplace where a spring came gushing up out of the earth and ran down toward\r\nthe plain; and about it was green grass growing plentifully, and a little\r\nthicket of bramble and wilding fruit-trees.  So he drank of the water,\r\nand plucked him a few wilding apples somewhat better than crabs, and then\r\nwent up the hill again and fetched the seekers to that mountain hostelry;\r\nand while they drank of the stream he plucked them apples and bramble-\r\nberries.  For indeed they were as men out of their wits, and were dazed\r\nby the extremity of their jog, and as men long shut up in prison, to whom\r\nthe world of men-folk hath become strange.  Simple as the victual was,\r\nthey were somewhat strengthened by it and by the plentiful water, and as\r\nnight was now upon them, it was of no avail for them to go further: so\r\nthey slept beneath the boughs of the thorn-bushes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII: HALLBLITHE DWELLETH IN THE WOOD ALONE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on the morrow they arose betimes, and broke their fast on that\r\nwoodland victual, and then went speedily down the mountain-side; and\r\nHallblithe saw by the clear morning light that it was indeed the\r\nUttermost House which he had seen across the green waste.  So he told the\r\nseekers; but they were silent and heeded nought, because of a fear that\r\nhad come upon them, lest they should die before they came into that good\r\nland.  At the foot of the mountain they came upon a river, deep but not\r\nwide, with low grassy banks, and Hallblithe, who was an exceeding strong\r\nswimmer, helped the seekers over without much ado; and there they stood\r\nupon the grass of that goodly waste.\r\n\r\nHallblithe looked on them to note if any change should come over them,\r\nand he deemed that already they were become stronger and of more avail.\r\nBut he spake nought thereof, and strode on toward the Uttermost House,\r\neven as that other day he had stridden away from it.\r\n\r\nSuch diligence they made, that it was but little after noon when they\r\ncame to the door thereof.  Then Hallblithe took the horn and blew upon\r\nit, while his fellows stood by murmuring, "It is the Land!  It is the\r\nLand!"\r\n\r\nSo came the Warden to the door, clad in red scarlet, and the elder went\r\nup to him and said: "Is this the Land?"\r\n\r\n"What land?" said the Warden.\r\n\r\n"Is it the Glittering Plain?" said the second of the seekers.\r\n\r\n"Yea, forsooth," said the Warden.  Said the sad man: "Will ye lead us to\r\nthe King?\r\n\r\n"Ye shall come to the King," said the Warden.\r\n\r\n"When, oh when?" cried they out all three.\r\n\r\n"The morrow of to-morrow, maybe," said the Warden.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if to-morrow were but come!" they cried.\r\n\r\n"It will come," said the red man; "enter ye the house, and eat and drink\r\nand rest you."\r\n\r\nSo they entered, and the Warden heeded Hallblithe nothing.  They ate and\r\ndrank and then went to their rest, and Hallblithe lay in a shut-bed off\r\nfrom the hall, but the Warden brought the seekers otherwhere, so that\r\nHallblithe saw them not after he had gone to bed; but as for him he slept\r\nand forgot that aught was.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when he awoke he felt very strong and well-liking; and he\r\nbeheld his limbs that they were clear of skin and sleek and fair; and he\r\nheard one hard by in the hall carolling and singing joyously.  So he\r\nsprang from his bed with the wonder of sleep yet in him, and drew the\r\ncurtains of the shut-bed and looked forth into the hall; and lo on the\r\nhigh-seat a man of thirty winters by seeming, tall, fair of fashion, with\r\ngolden hair and eyes as grey as glass, proud and noble of aspect; and\r\nanigh him sat another man of like age to look on, a man strong and burly,\r\nwith short curling brown hair and a red beard, and ruddy countenance, and\r\nthe mien of a warrior.  Also, up and down the hall, paced a man younger\r\nof aspect than these two, tall and slender, black-haired and dark-eyed,\r\namorous of countenance; he it was who was singing a snatch of song as he\r\nwent lightly on the hall pavement: a snatch like to this\r\n\r\n   Fair is the world, now autumn\'s wearing,\r\n   And the sluggard sun lies long abed;\r\n   Sweet are the days, now winter\'s nearing,\r\n   And all winds feign that the wind is dead.\r\n\r\n   Dumb is the hedge where the crabs hang yellow,\r\n   Bright as the blossoms of the spring;\r\n   Dumb is the close where the pears grow mellow,\r\n   And none but the dauntless redbreasts sing.\r\n\r\n   Fair was the spring, but amidst his greening\r\n   Grey were the days of the hidden sun;\r\n   Fair was the summer, but overweening,\r\n   So soon his o\'er-sweet days were done.\r\n\r\n   Come then, love, for peace is upon us,\r\n   Far off is failing, and far is fear,\r\n   Here where the rest in the end hath won us,\r\n   In the garnering tide of the happy year.\r\n\r\n   Come from the grey old house by the water,\r\n   Where, far from the lips of the hungry sea,\r\n   Green groweth the grass o\'er the field of the slaughter,\r\n   And all is a tale for thee and me.\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe did on his raiment and went into the hall; and when those\r\nthree saw him they smiled upon him kindly and greeted him; and the noble\r\nman at the board said: "Thanks have thou, O Warrior of the Raven, for thy\r\nhelp in our need: thy reward from us shall not be lacking."\r\n\r\nThen the brown-haired man came up to him, and clapped him on the back and\r\nsaid to him: "Brisk man of the Raven, good is thy help at need; even so\r\nshall be mine to thee henceforward."\r\n\r\nBut the young man stepped up to him lightly, and cast his arms about him,\r\nand kissed him, and said: "O friend and fellow, who knoweth but I may one\r\nday help thee as thou hast holpen me? though thou art one who by seeming\r\nmayst well help thyself.  And now mayst thou be as merry as I am to-day!"\r\n\r\nThen they all three cried out joyously: "It is the Land!  It is the\r\nLand!"\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe knew that these men were the two elders and the sad man of\r\nyesterday, and that they had renewed their youth.\r\n\r\nJoyously now did those men break their fast: nor did Hallblithe make any\r\ngrim countenance, for he thought: "That which these dotards and\r\ndrivellers have been mighty enough to find, shall I not be mighty enough\r\nto flee from?"  Breakfast done, the seekers made little delay, so eager\r\nas they were to behold the King, and to have handsel of their new sweet\r\nlife.  So they got them ready to depart, and the once-captain said: "Art\r\nthou able to lead us to the King, O Raven-son, or must we seek another\r\nman to do so much for us?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "I am able to lead you so nigh unto Wood-end (where, as\r\nI deem, the King abideth) that ye shall not miss him."\r\n\r\nTherewith they went to the door, and the Warden unlocked to them, and\r\nspake no word to them when they departed, though they thanked him kindly\r\nfor the guesting.\r\n\r\nWhen they were without the garth, the young man fell to running about the\r\nmeadow plucking great handfuls of the rich flowers that grew about,\r\nsinging and carolling the while.  But he who had been king looked up and\r\ndown and round about, and said at last: "Where be the horses and the\r\nmen?"\r\n\r\nBut his fellow with the red beard said: "Raven-son, in this land when\r\nthey journey, what do they as to riding or going afoot?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Fair fellows, ye shall wot that in this land folk go\r\nafoot for the most part, both men and women; whereas they weary but\r\nlittle, and are in no haste."\r\n\r\nThen the once-captain clapped the once-king on the shoulder, and said:\r\n"Hearken, lord, and delay no longer, but gird up thy gown, since here is\r\nno mare\'s son to help thee: for fair is to-day that lies before us, with\r\nmany a new fair day beyond it."\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe led the way inward, thinking of many things, yet but little\r\nof his fellows.  Albeit they, and the younger man especially, were of\r\nmany words; for this black-haired man had many questions to ask, chiefly\r\nconcerning the women, what they were like to look on, and of what mood\r\nthey were.  Hallblithe answered thereto as long as he might, but at last\r\nhe laughed and said: "Friend, forbear thy questions now; for meseemeth in\r\na few hours thou shalt be as wise hereon as is the God of Love himself."\r\n\r\nSo they made diligence along the road, and all was tidingless till on the\r\nsecond day at even they came to the first house off the waste.  There had\r\nthey good welcome, and slept.  But on the morrow when they arose,\r\nHallblithe spake to the Seekers, and said: "Now are things much changed\r\nbetwixt us since the time when we first met: for then I had all my\r\ndesire, as I thought, and ye had but one desire, and well nigh lacked\r\nhope of its fulfilment.  Whereas now the lack hath left you and come to\r\nme.  Wherefore even as time agone ye might not abide even one night at\r\nthe House of the Raven, so hard as your desire lay on you; even so it\r\nfareth with me to-day, that I am consumed with my desire, and I may not\r\nabide with you; lest that befall which befalleth betwixt the full man and\r\nthe fasting.  Wherefore now I bless you and depart."\r\n\r\nThey abounded in words of good-will to him, and the once-king said:\r\n"Abide with us, and we shall see to it that thou have all the dignities\r\nthat a man may think of."\r\n\r\nAnd the once-captain said: "Lo, here is mine hand that hath been mighty;\r\nnever shalt thou lack it for the accomplishment of thine uttermost\r\ndesire.  Abide with us."\r\n\r\nLastly said the young man: "Abide with us, Son of the Raven!  Set thine\r\nheart on a fair woman, yea even were it the fairest; and I will get her\r\nfor thee, even were my desire set on her."\r\n\r\nBut he smiled on them, and shook his head, and said: "All hail to you!\r\nbut mine errand is yet undone."  And therewith he departed.\r\n\r\nHe skirted Wood-end and came not to it, but got him down to the side of\r\nthe sea, not far from where he first came aland, but somewhat south of\r\nit.  A fair oak-wood came down close to the beach of the sea; it was some\r\nfour miles end-long and over-thwart.  Thither Hallblithe betook him, and\r\nin a day or two got him wood-wright\'s tools from a house of men a little\r\noutside the wood, three miles from the sea-shore.  Then he set to work\r\nand built him a little frame-house on a lawn of the wood beside a clear\r\nstream; for he was a very deft wood-wright.  Withal he made him a bow and\r\narrows, and shot what he would of the fowl and the deer for his\r\nlivelihood; and folk from that house and otherwhence came to see him, and\r\nbrought him bread and wine and spicery and other matters which he needed.\r\nAnd the days wore, and men got used to him, and loved him as if he had\r\nbeen a rare image which had been brought to that land for its adornment;\r\nand now they no longer called him the Spearman, but the Wood-lover.  And\r\nas for him, he took all in patience, abiding what the lapse of days\r\nshould bring forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX: HALLBLITHE BUILDS HIM A SKIFF\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Hallblithe had been housed a little while, and the time was again\r\ndrawing nigh to the twelfth moon since he had come to the Glittering\r\nPlain, he went in the wood one day; and, pondering many things without\r\nfixing on any one, he stood before a very great oak-tree and looked at\r\nthe tall straight bole thereof, and there came into his head the words of\r\nan old song which was written round a scroll of the carving over the shut-\r\nbed, wherein he was wont to lie when he was at home in the House of the\r\nRaven: and thus it said:\r\n\r\n   I am the oak-tree, and forsooth\r\n   Men deal by me with little ruth;\r\n   My boughs they shred, my life they slay,\r\n   And speed me o\'er the watery way.\r\n\r\nHe looked up into that leafy world for a little and then turned back\r\ntoward his house; but all day long, whether he were at work or at rest,\r\nthat posy ran in his head, and he kept on saying it over, aloud or not\r\naloud, till the day was done and he went to sleep.\r\n\r\nThen in his sleep he dreamed that an exceeding fair woman stood by his\r\nbedside, and at first she seemed to him to be an image of the Hostage.\r\nBut presently her face changed, and her body and her raiment; and, lo! it\r\nwas the lovely woman, the King\'s daughter whom he had seen wasting her\r\nheart for the love of him.  Then even in his dream shame thereof overtook\r\nhim, and because of that shame he awoke, and lay awake a little,\r\nhearkening the wind going through the woodland boughs, and the singing of\r\nthe owl who had her dwelling in the hollow oak nigh to his house.  Slumber\r\novercame him in a little while, and again the image of the King\'s\r\ndaughter came to him in his dream, and again when he looked upon her,\r\nshame and pity rose so hotly in his heart that he awoke weeping, and lay\r\na while hearkening to the noises of the night.  The third time he slept\r\nand dreamed; and once more that image came to him.  And now he looked,\r\nand saw that she had in her hand a book covered outside with gold and\r\ngems, even as he saw it in the orchard-close aforetime: and he beheld her\r\nface that it was no longer the face of one sick with sorrow; but glad and\r\nclear, and most beauteous.\r\n\r\nNow she opened the book and held it before Hallblithe and turned the\r\nleaves so that he might see them clearly; and therein were woods and\r\ncastles painted, and burning mountains, and the wall of the world, and\r\nkings upon their thrones, and fair women and warriors, all most lovely to\r\nbehold, even as he had seen it aforetime in the orchard when he lay\r\nlurking amidst the leaves of the bay-tree.\r\n\r\nSo at last she came to the place in the book wherein was painted\r\nHallblithe\'s own image over against the image of the Hostage; and he\r\nlooked thereon and longed.  But she turned the leaf, and, lo! on one side\r\nthe Hostage again, standing in a fair garden of the spring with the\r\nlilies all about her feet, and behind her the walls of a house, grey,\r\nancient, and lovely: and on the other leaf over against her was painted a\r\nsea rippled by a little wind and a boat thereon sailing swiftly, and one\r\nman alone in the boat sitting and steering with a cheerful countenance;\r\nand he, who but Hallblithe himself.  Hallblithe looked thereon for a\r\nwhile and then the King\'s daughter shut the book, and the dream flowed\r\ninto other imaginings of no import.\r\n\r\nIn the grey dawn Hallblithe awoke, and called to mind his dream, and he\r\nleapt from his bed and washed the night from off him in the stream, and\r\nclad himself and went the shortest way through the wood to that House of\r\nfolk aforesaid: and as he went his face was bright and he sang the second\r\npart of the carven posy; to wit:\r\n\r\n   Along the grass I lie forlorn\r\n   That when a while of time is worn,\r\n   I may be filled with war and peace\r\n   And bridge the sundering of the seas.\r\n\r\nHe came out of the wood and hastened over the flowery meads of the\r\nGlittering Plain, and came to that same house when it was yet very early.\r\nAt the door he came across a damsel bearing water from the well, and she\r\nspake to him and said: "Welcome, Wood-lover!  Seldom art thou seen in our\r\ngarth; and that is a pity of thee.  And now I look on thy face I see that\r\ngladness hath come into thine heart, and that thou art most fair and\r\nlovely.  Here then is a token for thee of the increase of gladness."\r\nTherewith she set her buckets on the earth, and stood before him, and\r\ntook him by the ears, and drew down his face to hers and kissed him\r\nsweetly.  He smiled on her and said: "I thank thee, sister, for the kiss\r\nand the greeting; but I come here having a lack."\r\n\r\n"Tell us," she said, "that we may do thee a pleasure."\r\n\r\nHe said: "I would ask the folk to give me timber, both beams and battens\r\nand boards; for if I hew in the wood it will take long to season."\r\n\r\n"All this is free for thee to take from our wood-store when thou hast\r\nbroken thy fast with us," said the damsel.  "Come thou in and rest thee."\r\n\r\nShe took him by the hand and they went in together, and she gave him to\r\neat and drink, and went up and down the house, saying to every one: "Here\r\nis come the Wood-lover, and he is glad again; come and see him."\r\n\r\nSo the folk gathered about him, and made much of him.  And when they had\r\nmade an end of breakfast, the head man of the House said to him: "The\r\nbeasts are in the wain, and the timber abideth thy choosing; come and\r\nsee."\r\n\r\nSo he brought Hallblithe to the timber-bower, where he chose for himself\r\nall that he needed of oak-timber of the best; and they loaded the wain\r\ntherewith, and gave him what he would moreover of nails and treenails and\r\nother matters; and he thanked them; and they said to him: "Whither now\r\nshall we lead thy timber?"\r\n\r\n"Down to the sea-side," quoth he, "nighest to my dwelling."\r\n\r\nSo did they, and more than a score, men and women, went with him, some in\r\nthe wain, and some afoot.  Thus they came down to the sea-shore, and laid\r\nthe timber on the strand just above high-water mark; and straightway\r\nHallblithe fell to work shaping him a boat, for well he knew the whole\r\ncraft thereof; and the folk looked on wondering, till the tide had ebbed\r\nthe little it was wont to ebb, and left the moist sand firm and smooth;\r\nthen the women left watching Hallblithe\'s work, and fell to paddling\r\nbarefoot in the clear water, for there was scarce a ripple on the sea;\r\nand the carles came and played with them so that Hallblithe was left\r\nalone a while; for this kind of play was new to that folk, since they\r\nseldom came down to the sea-side.  Thereafter they needs must dance\r\ntogether, and would have had Hallblithe dance with them; and when he\r\nnaysaid them because he was fain of his work, in all playfulness they\r\nfell to taking the adze out of his hand, whereat he became somewhat\r\nwroth, and they were afraid and went and had their dance out without him.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sun was grown very hot, and they came to him again, and\r\nlay down about him and watched his work, for they were weary.  And one of\r\nthe women, still panting with the dance, spake as she looked on the\r\nloveliness of her limbs, which one of the swains was caressing:\r\n"Brother," said she, "great strokes thou smitest; when wilt thou have\r\nsmitten the last of them, and come to our house again?"\r\n\r\n"Not for many days, fair sister," said he, without looking up.\r\n\r\n"Alas that thou shouldst talk so," said a carle, rising up from the warm\r\nsand; "what shall all thy toil win thee?"\r\n\r\nSpake Hallblithe: "Maybe a merry heart, or maybe death."\r\n\r\nAt that word they all rose up together, and stood huddled together like\r\nsheep that have been driven to the croft-gate, and the shepherd hath left\r\nthem for a little and they know not whither to go.  Little by little they\r\ngot them to the wain and harnessed their beasts thereto, and departed\r\nsilently by the way that they had come; but in a little time Hallblithe\r\nheard their laughter and merry speech across the flowery meadows.  He\r\nheeded their departure little, but went on working, and worked the sun\r\ndown, and on till the stars began to twinkle.  Then he went home to his\r\nhouse in the wood, and slept and dreamed not, and began again on the\r\nmorrow with a good heart.\r\n\r\nTo be short, no day passed that he wrought not his full tale of work, and\r\nthe days wore, and his ship-wright\'s work throve.  Often the folk of that\r\nhouse, and from otherwhere round about, came down to the strand to watch\r\nhim working.  Nowise did they wilfully hinder him, but whiles when they\r\ncould get no talk from him, they would speak of him to each other,\r\nwondering that he should so toil to sail upon the sea; for they loved the\r\nsea but little, and it soon became clear to them that he was looking to\r\nnought else: though it may not be said that they deemed he would leave\r\nthe land for ever.  On the other hand, if they hindered him not, neither\r\ndid they help, saving when he prayed them for somewhat which he needed,\r\nwhich they would then give him blithely.\r\n\r\nOf the Sea-eagle and his damsel, Hallblithe saw nought; whereat he was\r\nwell content, for he deemed it of no avail to make a second sundering of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo he worked and kept his heart up, and at last all was ready; he had\r\nmade him a mast and a sail, and oars, and whatso-other gear there was\r\nneed of.  So then he thrust his skiff into the sea on an evening whenas\r\nthere were but two carles standing by; for there would often be a score\r\nor two of folk.  These two smiled on him and bespake him kindly, but\r\nwould not help him when he bade them set shoulder to her bows and shove.\r\nAlbeit he got the skiff into the water without much ado, and got into\r\nher, and brought her to where a stream running from out of his wood made\r\na little haven for her up from the sea.  There he tied her to a\r\ntree-hole, and busied himself that even with getting the gear into her,\r\nand victual and water withal, as much as he deemed he should need: and\r\nso, being weary, he went to his house to sleep, thinking that he should\r\nawake in the grey of the morning and thrust out into the deep sea.  And\r\nhe was the more content to abide, because on that eve, as oftenest betid,\r\nthe wind blew landward from the sea, whereas in the morning it oftenest\r\nblew seaward from the land.  In any case he thought to be astir so timely\r\nthat he should come alone to his keel, and depart with no leave-takings.\r\nBut, as it fell out, he overslept himself, so that when he came out into\r\nthe wood clad in all his armour, with his sword girt to his side, and his\r\nspear over his shoulder, he heard the voices of folk, and presently found\r\nso many gathered about his boat that he had some ado to get aboard.\r\n\r\nThe folk had brought many gifts for him of such things as they deemed he\r\nmight need for a short voyage, as fruit and wine, and woollen cloths to\r\nkeep the cold night from him; he thanked them kindly as he stepped over\r\nthe gunwale, and some of the women kissed him: and one said (she it was,\r\nwho had met him at the stead that morning when he went to fetch timber):\r\n"Thou wilt be back this even, wilt thou not, brother?  It is yet but\r\nearly, and thou shalt have time enough to take all thy pleasure on the\r\nsea, and then come back to us to eat thy meat in our house at nightfall."\r\n\r\nShe spake, knitting her brows in longing for his return; but he knew that\r\nall those deemed he would come back again soon; else had they deemed him\r\na rebel of the King, and might, as he thought, have stayed him.  So he\r\nchanged not countenance in any wise, but said only: "farewell, sister,\r\nfor this day, and farewell to all you till I come back."\r\n\r\nTherewith he unmoored his boat, and sat down and took the oars, and rowed\r\ntill he was out of the little haven, and on the green sea, and the keel\r\nrose and fell on the waves.  Then he stepped the mast and hoisted sail,\r\nand sheeted home, for the morning wind was blowing gently from the\r\nmountains over the meadows of the Glittering Plain, so the sail filled,\r\nand the keel leapt forward and sped over the face of the cold sea.  And\r\nit is to be said that whether he wotted or not, it was the very day\r\ntwelve months since he had come to that shore along with the Sea-eagle.\r\nSo that folk stood and watched the skiff growing less and less upon the\r\ndeep till they could scarce see her.  Then they turned about and went\r\ninto the wood to disport them, for the sun was growing hot.  Nevertheless,\r\nthere were some of them (and that damsel was one), who came back to the\r\nsea-shore from time to time all day long; and even when the sun was down\r\nthey looked seaward under the rising moon, expecting to see Hallblithe\'s\r\nbark come into the shining path which she drew across the waters round\r\nabout the Glittering Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX: SO NOW SAILETH HALLBLITHE AWAY FROM THE GLITTERING PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as to Hallblithe, he soon lost sight of the Glittering Plain and the\r\nmountains thereof, and there was nought but sea all round about him, and\r\nhis heart swelled with joy as he sniffed the brine and watched the\r\ngleaming hills and valleys of the restless deep; and he said to himself\r\nthat he was going home to his Kindred and the Roof of his Fathers of old\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHe stood as near due north as he might; but as the day wore, the wind\r\nheaded him, and he deemed it not well to beat, lest he should make his\r\nvoyage overlong; so he ran on with the wind abeam, and his little craft\r\nleapt merrily over the sea-hills under the freshening breeze.  The sun\r\nset and the moon and stars shone out, and he still sailed on, and durst\r\nnot sleep, save as a dog does, with one eye.  At last came dawn, and as\r\nthe light grew it was a fair day with a falling wind, and a bright sky,\r\nbut it clouded over before sunset, and the wind freshened from the north\r\nby east, and, would he, would he not, Hallblithe must run before it night-\r\nlong, till at sunrise it fell again, and all day was too light for him to\r\nmake much way beating to northward; nor did it freshen till after the\r\nmoon was risen some while after sunset.  And now he was so weary that he\r\nmust needs sleep; so he lashed the helm, and took a reef in the sail, and\r\nran before the wind, he sleeping in the stern.\r\n\r\nBut past the middle of the night, towards the dawning, he awoke with the\r\nsound of a great shout in his ears.  So he looked over the dark waters,\r\nand saw nought, for the night was cloudy again.  Then he trimmed his\r\ncraft, and went to sleep again, for he was over-burdened with slumber.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was broad daylight; so he looked to the tiller and got\r\nthe boat\'s head a little up to the wind, and then gazed about him with\r\nthe sleep still in his eyes.  And as his eyes took in the picture before\r\nhim he could not refrain a cry; for lo! there arose up great and grim\r\nright ahead the black cliffs of the Isle of Ransom.  Straightway he got\r\nto the sheet, and strove to wear the boat; but for all that he could do\r\nshe drifted toward the land, for she was gotten into a strong current of\r\nthe sea that set shoreward.  So he struck sail, and took the oars and\r\nrowed mightily so that he might bear her off shore; but it availed\r\nnothing, and still he drifted landward.  So he stood up from the oars,\r\nand turned about and looked, and saw that he was but some three furlongs\r\nfrom the shore, and that he was come to the very haven-mouth whence he\r\nhad set sail with the Sea-eagle a twelvemonth ago: and he knew that into\r\nthat haven he needs must get him, or be dashed to pieces against the high\r\ncliffs of the land: and he saw how the waves ran on to the cliffs, and\r\nwhiles one higher than the others smote the rock-wall and ran up it, as\r\nif it could climb over on to the grassy lip beyond, and then fell back\r\nagain, leaving a river of brine running down the steep.\r\n\r\nThen he said that he would take what might befall him inside the haven.\r\nSo he hoisted sail again, and took the tiller, and steered right for the\r\nmidmost of the gate between the rocks, wondering what should await him\r\nthere.  Then it was but a few minutes ere his bark shot into the\r\nsmoothness of the haven, and presently began to lose way; for all the\r\nwind was dead within that land-locked water.  Hallblithe looked steadily\r\nround about seeking his foe; but the haven was empty of ship or boat; so\r\nhe ran his eye along the shore to see where he should best lay his keel\r\nand as aforesaid there was no beach there, and the water was deep right\r\nup to the grassy lip of the land; though the tides ran somewhat high, and\r\nat low water would a little steep undercliff go up from the face of the\r\nsea.  But now it was near the top of the tide, and there was scarce two\r\nfeet betwixt the grass and the dark-green sea.\r\n\r\nNow Hallblithe steered toward an ingle of the haven; and beyond it, a\r\nlittle way off, rose a reef of rocks out of the green grass, and thereby\r\nwas a flock of sheep feeding, and a big man lying down amongst them, who\r\nseemed to be unarmed, as Hallblithe could not see any glint of steel\r\nabout him.  Hallblithe drew nigh the shore, and the big man stirred not;\r\nnor did he any the more when the keel ran along the shore, and Hallblithe\r\nleapt out and moored his craft to his spear stuck deep in the earth.  And\r\nnow Hallblithe deems that the man must be either dead or asleep: so he\r\ndrew his sword and had it in his right hand, and in his left a sharp\r\nknife, and went straight up to the man betwixt the sheep, and found him\r\nso lying on his side that he could not see his face; so he stirred him\r\nwith his foot, and cried out: "Awake, O Shepherd! for dawn is long past\r\nand day is come, and therewithal a guest for thee!"\r\n\r\nThe man turned over and slowly sat up, and, lo! who should it be but the\r\nPuny Fox?  Hallblithe started back at the sight of him, and cried out at\r\nhim, and said: "Have I found thee, O mine enemy?"\r\n\r\nThe Puny Fox sat up a little straighter, and rubbed his eyes and said:\r\n"Yea, thou hast found me sure enough.  But as to my being thine enemy, a\r\nword or two may be said about that presently."\r\n\r\n"What!" said Hallblithe, "dost thou deem that aught save my sword will\r\nspeak to thee?"\r\n\r\n"I wot not," said the Puny Fox, slowly rising to his feet, "but I suppose\r\nthou wilt not slay me unarmed, and thou seest that I have no weapons."\r\n\r\n"Get thee weapons, then," quoth Hallblithe, "and delay not; for the sight\r\nof thee alive sickens me."\r\n\r\n"Ill is that," said the Puny Fox, "but come thou with me at once, where I\r\nshall find both the weapons and a good fighting-stead.  Hasten! time\r\npresseth, now thou art come at last."\r\n\r\n"And my boat?" said Hallblithe.\r\n\r\n"Wilt thou carry her in thy pouch?" said the Puny Fox; "thou wilt not\r\nneed her again, whether thou slay me, or I thee."\r\n\r\nHallblithe knit his brows on him in his wrath; for he deemed that Fox\'s\r\nmeaning was to threaten him with the vengeance of the kindred.  Howbeit,\r\nhe said nought; for he deemed it ill to wrangle in words with one whom he\r\nwas presently to meet in battle; so he followed as the Puny Fox led.  Fox\r\nbrought him past the reef of rock aforesaid, and up a narrow cleft of the\r\ncliffs overlooking the sea, whereby they came into a little grass-grown\r\nmeadow well nigh round in shape, as smooth and level as a hall-floor, and\r\nfenced about by a wall of rock: a place which had once been the mouth of\r\nan earth-fire, and a cauldron of molten stone.\r\n\r\nWhen they stood on the smooth grass Fox said: "Hold thee there a little,\r\nwhile I go to my weapon-chest, and then shall we see what is to be done."\r\n\r\nTherewith he turned aside to a cranny of the rock, and going down on his\r\nhands and knees, fell to creeping like a worm up a hole therein, which\r\nbelike led to a cavern; for after his voice had come forth from the\r\nearth, grunting and groaning, and cursing this thing, and that, out he\r\ncomes again feet first, and casts down an old rusty sword without a\r\nsheath; a helm no less rusty, and battered withal, and a round target,\r\ncurled up and outworn as if it would fall to pieces of itself.  Then he\r\nstands up and stretches himself, and smiles pleasantly on Hallblithe and\r\nsays: "Now, mine enemy, when I have donned helm and shield and got my\r\nsword in hand, we may begin the play: as to a hauberk I must needs go\r\nlack; for I could not come by it; I think the old man must have chaffered\r\nit away: he was ever too money-fain."\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe looked on him angrily and said: "Hast thou brought me\r\nhither to mock me?  Hast thou no better weapons wherewith to meet a\r\nwarrior of the Raven than these rusty shards, which look as if thou hadst\r\nrobbed a grave of the dead?  I will not fight thee so armed."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Puny Fox, "and from out of a grave come they verily: for\r\nin that little hole lieth my father\'s grandsire, the great Sea-mew of the\r\nRavagers, the father of that Sea-eagle whom thou knowest.  But since thou\r\nthinkest scorn of these weapons of a dead warrior, in go the old carle\'s\r\ntreasures again!  It is as well maybe; since he might be wrath beyond his\r\nwont if he were to wake and miss them; and already this cold cup of the\r\nonce-boiling rock is not wholly safe because of him."\r\n\r\nSo he crept into the hole once more, and out of it presently, and stood\r\nsmiting his palms one against the other to dust them, like a man who has\r\nbeen handling parchments long laid by; and Hallblithe stood looking at\r\nhim, still wrathful, but silent.\r\n\r\nThen said the Puny Fox: "This at least was a wise word of thine, that\r\nthou wouldst not fight me.  For the end of fighting is slaying; and it is\r\nstark folly to fight without slaying; and now I see that thou desirest\r\nnot to slay me: for if thou didst, why didst thou refuse to fall on me\r\narmed with the ghosts of weapons that I borrowed from a ghost?  Nay, why\r\ndidst thou not slay me as I crept out of yonder hole?  Thou wouldst have\r\nhad a cheap bargain of me either way.  It would be rank folly to fight\r\nme."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe hoarsely: "Why didst thou bewray me, and lie to me, and\r\nlure me away from the quest of my beloved, and waste a whole year of my\r\nlife?"\r\n\r\n"It is a long story," said the Puny Fox, "which I may tell thee some day.\r\nMeantime I may tell thee this, that I was compelled thereto by one far\r\nmightier than I, to wit the Undying King."\r\n\r\nAt that word the smouldering wrath blazed up in Hallblithe, and he drew\r\nhis sword hastily and hewed at the Puny Fox: but he leapt aside nimbly\r\nand ran in on Hallblithe, and caught his sword-arm by the wrist, and tore\r\nthe weapon out of his hand, and overbore him by sheer weight and stature,\r\nand drave him to the earth.  Then he rose up, and let Hallblithe rise\r\nalso, and took his sword and gave it into his hand again and said: "Crag-\r\nnester, thou art wrathful, but little.  Now thou hast thy sword again and\r\nmayst slay me if thou wilt.  Yet not until I have spoken a word to thee:\r\nso hearken! or else by the Treasure of the Sea I will slay thee with my\r\nbare hands.  For I am strong indeed in this place with my old kinsman\r\nbeside me.  Wilt thou hearken?"\r\n\r\n"Speak," said Hallblithe, "I hearken."\r\n\r\nSaid the Puny Fox: "True it is that I lured thee away from thy quest, and\r\nwore away a year of thy life.  Yet true it is also that I repent me\r\nthereof, and ask thy pardon.  What sayest thou?"\r\n\r\nHallblithe spake not, but the heat died out of his face and he was become\r\nsomewhat pale.  Said the Puny Fox: "Dost thou not remember, O Raven, how\r\nthou badest me battle last year on the sea-shore by the side of the\r\nRollers of the Raven? and how this was to be the prize of battle, that\r\nthe vanquished should serve the vanquisher year-long, and do all his\r\nwill?  And now this prize and more thou hast won without battle; for I\r\nswear by the Treasure of the Sea, and by the bones of the great Sea-mew\r\nyonder, that I will serve thee not year-long but life-long, and that I\r\nwill help thee in thy quest for thy beloved.  What sayest thou?"\r\n\r\nHallblithe stood speechless a moment, looking past the Puny Fox, rather\r\nthan at him.  Then the sword tumbled out of his hand on to the grass, and\r\ngreat tears rolled down his cheeks and fell on to his raiment, and he\r\nreached out his hand to the Puny Fox and said: "O friend, wilt thou not\r\nbring me to her? for the days wear, and the trees are growing old round\r\nabout the Acres of the Raven."\r\n\r\nThen the Puny Fox took his hand; and laughed merrily in his face, and\r\nsaid: "Great is thine heart, O Carrion-biter!  But now that thou art my\r\nfriend I will tell thee that I have a deeming of the whereabouts of thy\r\nbeloved.  Or where deemest thou was the garden wherein thou sawest her\r\nstanding on the page of the book in that dream of the night?  So it is, O\r\nRaven-son, that it is not for nothing that my grandsire\'s father lieth in\r\nyonder hole of the rocks; for of late he hath made me wise in mighty\r\nlore.  Thanks have thou, O kinsman!"  And he turned him toward the rock\r\nwherein was the grave.\r\n\r\nBut Hallblithe said: "What is to do now?  Am I not in a land of foemen?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, forsooth," said the Puny Fox, "and even if thou knewest where thy\r\nlove is, thou shouldst hardly escape from this isle unslain, save for\r\nme."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Is there not my bark, that I might depart at once? for\r\nI deem not that the Hostage is on the Isle of Ransom."\r\n\r\nThe Puny Fox laughed boisterously and said: "Nay, she is not.  But as to\r\nthy boat, there is so strong a set of the flood-tide toward this end of\r\nthe isle, that with the wind blowing as now, from the north-north-east,\r\nthou mayst not get off the shore for four hours at least, and I misdoubt\r\nme that within that time we shall have tidings of a ship of ours coming\r\ninto the haven.  Thy bark they shall take, and thee also if thou art\r\ntherein; and then soon were the story told, for they know thee for a\r\nrebel of the Undying King.  Hearken!  Dost thou not hear the horn\'s\r\nvoice?  Come up hither and we shall see what is towards."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he led hastily up a kind of stair in the rock-wall, until they\r\nreached a cranny, whence through a hole in the cliff, they could see all\r\nover the haven.  And lo! as they looked, in the very gate and entry of it\r\ncame a great ship heaving up her bows on the last swell of the outer sea\r\n(where the wind had risen somewhat), and rolling into the smooth, land-\r\nlocked water.  Black was her sail, and the image of the Sea-eagle\r\nenwrought thereon spread wide over it; and the banner of the Flaming\r\nSword streamed out from the stern.  Many men all-weaponed were on the\r\ndecks, and the minstrels high up on the poop were blowing a merry song of\r\nreturn on their battle-horns.\r\n\r\n"Lo, you," said the Puny Fox, "thy luck or mine hath served thee this\r\ntime, in that the Flaming Sword did not overhaul thee ere thou madest the\r\nhaven.  We are well here at least."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "But may not some of them come up hither perchance?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said the Puny Fox; "they fear the old man in the cleft\r\nyonder; for he is not over guest-fain.  This mead is mine own, as for\r\nother living men; it is my unroofed house, and I have here a house with a\r\nroof also, which I will show thee presently.  For now since the Flaming\r\nSword hath come, there is no need for haste; nay, we cannot depart till\r\nthey have gone up-country.  So I will show thee presently what we shall\r\ndo to-night."\r\n\r\nSo there they sat and watched those men bring their ship to the shore and\r\nmoor her hard by Hallblithe\'s boat.  They cried out when they saw her,\r\nand when they were aland they gathered about her to note her build, and\r\nthe fashion of the spear whereto she was tied.  Then in a while the more\r\npart of them, some fourscore in number, departed up the valley toward the\r\ngreat house and left none but a half dozen ship-warders behind.\r\n\r\n"Seest thou, friend of the Ravens," said the Fox, "hadst thou been there,\r\nthey might have done with thee what they would.  Did I not well to bring\r\nthee into my unroofed house?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, verily," said Hallblithe; "but will not some of the ship-wards, or\r\nsome of the others returning, come up hither and find us?  I shall yet\r\nlay my bones in this evil island."\r\n\r\nThe Puny Fox laughed, and said: "It is not so bad as thy sour looks would\r\nhave it; anyhow it is good enough for a grave, and at this present I may\r\ncall it a casket of precious things."\r\n\r\n"What meanest thou?" said Hallblithe eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said the other, "nought but what thou knowest.  Art thou not\r\ntherein, and I myself? without reckoning the old carle in the hole\r\nyonder.  But I promise thee thou shalt not die here this time, unless\r\nthou wilt.  And as to folk coming up hither, I tell thee again they durst\r\nnot; because they fear my great-grandsire over much.  Not that they are\r\nfar wrong therein; for now he is dead, the worst of him seemeth to come\r\nout of him, and he is not easily dealt with, save by one who hath some\r\nshare of his wisdom.  Thou thyself couldst see by my kinsman, the Sea-\r\neagle, how much of ill blood and churlish malice there may be in our\r\nkindred when they wax old, and loneliness and dreariness taketh hold of\r\nthem.  For I must tell thee that I have oft heard my father say that his\r\nfather the Sea-eagle was in his youth and his prime blithe and buxom, a\r\ngreat lover of women, and a very friendly fellow.  But ever, as I say, as\r\nthe men of our kind wax in years, they worsen; and thereby mayst thou\r\ndeem how bad the old man in yonder must be, since he hath lain so long in\r\nthe grave.  But now we will go to that house of mine on the other side of\r\nthe mead, over against my kinsman\'s."\r\n\r\nTherewith he led Hallblithe down from the rock while Hallblithe said to\r\nhim: "What! art thou also dead that thou hast a grave here?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said Fox, smiling, "am I so evil-conditioned then?  I am no\r\nolder than thou art."\r\n\r\n"But tell me," said Hallblithe, "wilt thou also wax evil as thou growest\r\nold?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe not," said Fox, looking hard at him, "for in my mind it is that I\r\nmay be taken into another house, and another kindred, and amongst them I\r\nshall be healed of much that might turn to ill."\r\n\r\nTherewith were they come across the little meadow to a place where was a\r\ncave in the rock closed with a door, and a wicket window therein.  Fox\r\nled Hallblithe into it, and within it was no ill dwelling; for it was dry\r\nand clean, and there were stools therein and a table, and shelves and\r\nlockers in the wall.  When they had sat them down Fox said: "Here\r\nmightest thou dwell safely as long as thou wouldst, if thou wouldst risk\r\ndealings with the old carle.  But, as I wot well that thou art in haste\r\nto be gone and get home to thy kindred, I must bring thee at dusk to-day\r\nclose up to our feast-hall, so that thou mayst be at hand to do what hath\r\nto be done to-night, so that we may get us gone to-morrow.  Also thou\r\nmust do off thy Raven gear lest we meet any in the twilight as we go up\r\nto the house; and here have I to hand home-spun raiment such as our war-\r\ntaken thralls wear, which shall serve thy turn well enough; but this thou\r\nneedst not do on till the time is at hand for our departure; and then I\r\nwill bring thee away, and bestow thee in a bower hard by the hall; and\r\nwhen thou art within, I may so look to it that none shall go in there, or\r\nif they do, they shall see nought in thee save a carle known to them by\r\nname.  My kinsman hath learned me to do harder things than this.  But now\r\nit is time to eat and drink."\r\n\r\nTherewith he drew victual from out a locker and they fell to.  But when\r\nthey had eaten, Fox taught Hallblithe what he should do in the hall that\r\nnight, as shall be told hereafter.  And then, with much talk about many\r\nthings, they wore away the day in that ancient cup of the seething rock,\r\nand a little before dusk set out for the hall, bearing with them\r\nHallblithe\'s gear bundled up together, as though it had been wares from\r\nover sea.  So they came to the house before the tables were set, and the\r\nPuny Fox bestowed Hallblithe in a bower which gave into the buttery, so\r\nthat it was easy to go straight into the mid-most of the hall.  There was\r\nHallblithe clad and armed in his Raven gear; but Fox gave him a vizard to\r\ngo over his face, so that none might know him when he entered therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI: OF THE FIGHT OF THE CHAMPIONS IN THE HALL OF THE RAVAGERS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is to be told that the chieftains came into the hall that night\r\nand sat down at the board on the dais, even as Hallblithe had seen them\r\ndo aforetime.  And the chieftain of all, who was called the Erne of the\r\nSea-eagles, rose up according to custom and said: "Hearken, folk! this is\r\na night of the champions, whereon we may not eat till the pale blades\r\nhave clashed together, and one hath vanquished and another been overcome.\r\nNow let them stand forth and give out the prize of victory which the\r\nvanquished shall pay to the vanquisher.  And let it be known, that,\r\nwhosoever may be the champion that winneth the battle, whether he be a\r\nkinsman, or an alien, or a foeman declared; yea, though he have left the\r\nhead of my brother at the hall-door, he shall pass this night with us\r\nsafe from sword, safe from axe, safe from hand: he shall eat as we eat,\r\ndrink as we drink, sleep as we sleep, and depart safe from any hand or\r\nweapon, and shall sail the sea at his pleasure in his own keel or in\r\nours, as to him and us may be meet.  Blow up horns for the champions!"\r\n\r\nSo the horns blew a cheerful strain, and when they were done, there came\r\ninto the hall a tall man clad in black, and with black armour and weapons\r\nsaving the white blade of his sword.  He had a vizard over his face, but\r\nhis hair came down from under his helm like the tail of a red horse.\r\n\r\nSo he stood amidst the floor and cried out: "I am the champion of the\r\nRavagers.  But I swear by the Treasure of the Sea that I will cross no\r\nblade to-night save with an alien, a foeman of the kindred.  Hearest\r\nthou, O chieftain, O Erne of the Sea-eagles?"\r\n\r\n"Hear it I do," said the chieftain, "and I deem that thy meaning is that\r\nwe should go supperless to bed; and this cometh of thy perversity: for we\r\nknow thee despite thy vizard.  Belike thou deemest that thou shalt not be\r\nmet this even, and that there is no free alien in the island to draw\r\nsword against thee.  But beware!  For when we came aland this morning we\r\nfound a skiff of the aliens tied to a great spear stuck in the bank of\r\nthe haven; so that there will be one foeman at least abroad in the\r\nisland.  But we said if we should come on the man, we would set his head\r\non the gable of the hall with the mouth open toward the North for a token\r\nof reproach to the dwellers in the land over sea.  But now give out the\r\nprize of victory, and I swear by the Treasure of the Sea that we will\r\nabide by thy word."\r\n\r\nSaid the champion: "These are the terms and conditions of the battle;\r\nthat whichso of us is vanquished, he shall either die, or serve the\r\nvanquisher for twelve moons, to fare with him at his will, to go his\r\nerrands, and do according to his commandment in all wise.  Hearest thou,\r\nchieftain?"\r\n\r\n"Yea," said he, "and by the Undying King, both thou and we shall abide by\r\nthis bargain.  So look to it that thou smite great strokes, lest our hall\r\nlack a gable-knop.  Horns, blow up for the alien champion!"\r\n\r\nSo again the horns were winded; and ere their voice had died, in from the\r\nbuttery screens came a glittering image of war, and there stood the alien\r\nchampion over against the warrior of the sea; and he too had a vizard\r\nover his face.\r\n\r\nNow when the folk saw him, and how slim and light and small he looked\r\nbeside their champion, and they beheld the Raven painted on his white\r\nshield, they hooted and laughed for scorn of him and his littleness.  But\r\nhe tossed his sword up lightly and caught it by the hilts as it fell, and\r\ndrew nigher to the champion of the sea and stood facing him within reach\r\nof his sword.  Then the chieftain on the high-seat put his two hands to\r\nhis mouth and roared out: "Fall on, ye champions, fall on!"\r\n\r\nBut the folk in the hall were so eager that they stood on the benches and\r\nthe boards, and craned over each other\'s shoulders, so that they might\r\nlose no whit of the hand-play.  Now flashed the blades in the candle-lit\r\nhall, and the red-haired champion hove up his sword and smote two great\r\nstrokes to right and to left; but the alien gave way before him, and the\r\nfolk cried out at him in scorn and in joy of their champion, who fell to\r\nraining down great strokes like the hail amidst the lightning.  But so\r\ndeft was the alien, that he stood amidst it unhurt, and laid many strokes\r\non his foeman, and did all so lightly and easily, that it seemed as if he\r\nwere dancing rather than fighting; and the folk held their peace and\r\nbegan to doubt if their huge champion would prevail.  Now the red-haired\r\nfetched a mighty stroke at the alien, who leapt aside lightly and gat his\r\nsword in his left hand and dealt a great stroke on the other\'s head, and\r\nthe red-haired staggered, for he had over-reached himself; and again the\r\nalien smote him a left-handed stroke so that he fell full length on the\r\nfloor with a mighty clatter, and the sword flew out of his hand: and the\r\nfolk were dumb-founded.\r\n\r\nThen the alien threw himself on the sea-champion, and knelt upon him, and\r\nshortened his sword as if to slay him with a thrust.  But thereon the man\r\noverthrown cried out: "Hold thine hand, for I am vanquished!  Now give me\r\npeace according to the bargain struck between us, that I shall serve thee\r\nyear-long, and follow thee wheresoever thou goest."\r\n\r\nTherewith the alien champion arose and stood off from him, and the man of\r\nthe sea gat to his feet, and did off his helm, so that all men could see\r\nthat he was the Puny Fox.\r\n\r\nThen the victorious champion unhelmed himself, and lo, it was Hallblithe!\r\nAnd a shout arose in the hall, part of wonder, part of wrath.\r\n\r\nThen cried out the Puny Fox: "I call on all men here to bear witness that\r\nby reason of this battle, Hallblithe of the Ravens is free to come and go\r\nas he will in the Isle of Ransom, and to take help of any man that will\r\nhelp him, and to depart from the isle when he will and how he will,\r\ntaking me with him if so he will."\r\n\r\nSaid the chieftain: "Yea, this is right and due, and so shall it be.  But\r\nnow, since no freeman, who is not a foe of the passing hour, may abide in\r\nour hall without eating of our meat, come up here, Hallblithe, and sit by\r\nme, and eat and drink of the best we have, since the Norns would not give\r\nus thine head for a gable-knop.  But what wilt thou do with thy thrall\r\nthe Puny Fox; and whereto in the hall wilt thou have him shown?  Or wilt\r\nthou that he sit fasting in the darkness to-night, laid in gyves and\r\nfetters?  Or shall he have the cheer of whipping and stripes, as\r\nbefitteth a thrall to whom the master oweth a grudge?  What is thy will\r\nwith him?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "My will is that thou give him a seat next to me,\r\nwhether that be high or low, or the bench of thy prison-house.  That he\r\neat of my dish, and drink of my cup, whatsoever the meat and drink may\r\nbe.  For to-morrow I mean that we twain shall go under the earth-collar\r\ntogether, and that our blood shall run together and that we shall be\r\nbrothers in arms henceforward."  Then Hallblithe did on his helm again\r\nand drew his sword, and looked aside to the Puny Fox to bid him do the\r\nlike, and he did so, and Hallblithe said: "Chieftain, thou hast bidden me\r\nto table, and I thank thee; but I will not set my teeth in meat, out of\r\nour own house and land, which hath not been truly given to me by one who\r\nwotteth of me, unless I have conquered it as a prey of battle; neither\r\nwill I cast a lie into the loving-cup which shall pass from thy lips to\r\nmine: therefore I will tell thee, that though I laid a stroke or two on\r\nthe Puny Fox, and those no light ones, yet was this battle nought true\r\nand real, but a mere beguiling, even as that which I saw foughten in this\r\nhall aforetime, when meseemeth the slain men rose up in time to drink the\r\ngood-night cup.  Therefore, O men of the Ravagers, and thou, O Puny Fox,\r\nthere is nought to bind your hands and refrain your hearts, and ye may\r\nslay me if ye will without murder or dishonour, and may make the head of\r\nHallblithe a knop for your feast-hall.  Yet shall one or two fall to\r\nearth before I fall."\r\n\r\nTherewith he shook his sword aloft, and a great roar arose, and weapons\r\ncame down from the wall, and the candles shone on naked steel.  But the\r\nPuny Fox came and stood by Hallblithe, and spake in his ear amidst the\r\nuproar: "Well now, brother-in-arms, I have been trying to learn thee the\r\nlore of lies, and surely thou art the worst scholar who was ever smitten\r\nby master.  And the outcome of it is that I, who have lied so long and\r\nwell, must now pay for all, and die for a barren truth."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Let all be as it will!  I love thee, lies and all; but\r\nas for me I cannot handle them.  Lo you! great and grim shall be the\r\nslaying, and we shall not fall unavenged."\r\n\r\nSaid the Puny Fox: "Hearken! for still they hang back.  Belike it is I\r\nthat have drawn this death on thee and me.  My last lie was a fool\'s lie\r\nand we die for it: for what wouldst thou have done hadst thou wotted that\r\nthy beloved, the Hostage of the Rose--"  He broke off perforce; for\r\nHallblithe was looking to right and left and handling his sword, and\r\nheard not that last word of his; and from both sides of the hall the\r\nthrong was drawing round about those twain, weapon in hand.  Then\r\nHallblithe set his eyes on a big man in front who was heaving up a heavy\r\nshort-sword and thought that he would at least slay this one.  But or\r\never he might smite, the great horn blared out over the tumult, and men\r\nforbore a while and fell somewhat silent.\r\n\r\nThen came down to them the voice of the chieftain, a loud voice, but\r\nclear and with mirth mingled with anger in it, and he said: "What do\r\nthese fools of the Ravagers cumbering the floor of the feast-hall, and\r\nshaking weapons when there is no foeman anigh?  Are they dreaming-drunk\r\nbefore the wine is poured?  Why do they not sit down in their places, and\r\nabide the bringing in of the meat?  And ye women, where are ye, why do ye\r\ndelay our meat, when ye may well wot that our hearts are drooping for\r\nhunger; and all hath been duly done, the battle of the champions fought\r\nand won, and the prize of war given forth and taken?  How long, O folk,\r\nshall your chieftains sit fasting?"\r\n\r\nThen there arose great laughter in the hall, and men withdrew them from\r\nthose twain and went and sat them down in their places.\r\n\r\nThen the chieftain said: "Come up hither, I say, O Hallblithe, and bring\r\nthy war-thrall with thee if thou wilt.  But delay not, unless it be so\r\nthat thou art neither hungry nor thirsty; and good sooth thou shouldst be\r\nboth; for men say that the ravens are hard to satisfy.  Come then and\r\nmake good cheer with us!"\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe thrust his sword into the sheath, and the Puny Fox did the\r\nlike, and they went both together up the hall to the high-seat.  And\r\nHallblithe sat down on the chieftain\'s right hand, and the Puny Fox next\r\nto him; and the chieftain, the Erne, said: "O Hallblithe, dost thou need\r\nthine armour at table; or dost thou find it handy to take thy meat clad\r\nin thy byrny and girt with a sword?"\r\n\r\nThen laughed Hallblithe and said: "Nay, meseemeth to-night I shall need\r\nwar-gear no more."  And he stood up and did off all his armour and gave\r\nit, sword and all, into the hands of a woman, who bore it off, he knew\r\nnot whither.  And the Erne looked on him and said: "Well is that! and now\r\nI see that thou art a fair young man, and it is no marvel though maidens\r\ndesire thee."\r\n\r\nAs he spake came in the damsels with the victual and the cheer was\r\nexceeding good, and Hallblithe grew light-hearted.\r\n\r\nBut when the healths had been drunk as aforetime, and men had drunk a cup\r\nor two thereafter, there rose a warrior from one of the endlong benches,\r\na big young man, black-haired and black-bearded, ruddy of visage, and he\r\nsaid in a voice that was rough and fat: "O Erne, and ye other chieftains,\r\nwe have been talking here at our table concerning this guest of thine who\r\nhath beguiled us, and we are not wholly at one with thee as to thy\r\ndealings with him.  True it is, now that the man hath our meat in his\r\nbelly, that he must depart from amongst us with a whole skin, unless of\r\nhis own will he stand up to fight some man of us here.  Yet some of us\r\nthink that he is not so much our friend that we should help him to a keel\r\nwhereon to fare home to those that hate us: and we say that it would not\r\nbe unlawful to let the man abide in the isle, and proclaim him a wolf\'s-\r\nhead within a half-moon of to-day.  Or what sayest thou?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Erne: "Wait for my word a while, and hearken to another!  Is the\r\nGrey-goose of the Ravagers in the hall?  Let him give out his word on\r\nthis matter."\r\n\r\nThen arose a white-headed carle from a table nigh to the dais, whose\r\nblack raiment was well adorned with gold.  Despite his years his face was\r\nfair and little wrinkled; a man with a straight nose and a well-fashioned\r\nmouth, and with eyes still bright and grey.  He spake: "O folk, I find\r\nthat the Erne hath done well in cherishing this guest.  For first, if he\r\nhath beguiled us, he did it not save by the furtherance and sleight of\r\nour own kinsman; therefore if any one is to die for beguiling us, let it\r\nbe the Puny Fox.  Secondly, we may well wot that heavy need hath driven\r\nthe man to this beguilement; and I say that it was no unmanly deed for\r\nhim to enter our hall and beguile us with his sleight; and that he hath\r\nplayed out the play right well and cunningly with the wisdom of a\r\nwarrior.  Thirdly, the manliness of him is well proven, in that having\r\novercome us in sleight, he hath spoken out the sooth concerning our\r\nbeguilement and hath made himself our foeman and captive, when he might\r\nhave sat down by us as our guest, freely and in all honour.  And this he\r\ndid, not as contemning the Puny Fox and his lies and crafty wiles (for he\r\nhath told us that he loveth him); but so that he might show himself a man\r\nin that which trieth manhood.  Moreover, ye shall not forget that he is\r\nthe rebel of the Undying King, who is our lord and master; therefore in\r\ncherishing him we show ourselves great-hearted, in that we fear not the\r\nwrath of our master.  Therefore I naysay the word of the War-brand that\r\nwe should make this man a wolf\'s-head; for in so doing we shall show\r\nourselves lesser-hearted than he is, and of no account beside of him; and\r\nhis head on our hall-gable should be to us a nithing-stake, and a tree of\r\nreproach.  So I bid thee, O Erne, to make much of this man; and thou\r\nshalt do well to give him worthy gifts, such as warriors may take, so\r\nthat he may show them at home in the House of the Raven, that it may be\r\nthe beginning of peace betwixt us and his noble kindred.  This is my say,\r\nand later on I shall wax no wiser."\r\n\r\nTherewith he sat down, and there arose a murmur and stir in the hall; but\r\nthe more part said that the Grey-goose had spoken well, and that it was\r\ngood to be at peace with such manly fellows as the new guest was.\r\n\r\nBut the Erne said: "One word will I lay hereto, to wit, that he who\r\ndesireth mine enmity let him do scathe to Hallblithe of the Ravens and\r\nhinder him."\r\n\r\nThen he bade fill round the cups, and called a health to Hallblithe, and\r\nall men drank to him, and there was much joyance and merriment.\r\n\r\nBut when the night was well worn, the Erne turned to Hallblithe and said:\r\n"That was a good word of the Grey-goose which he spake concerning the\r\ngiving of gifts: Raven-son, wilt thou take a gift of me and be my\r\nfriend?"\r\n\r\n"Thy friend will I be," said Hallblithe, "but no gift will I take of thee\r\nor any other till I have the gift of gifts, and that is my troth-plight\r\nmaiden.  I will not be glad till I can be glad with her."\r\n\r\nThen laughed the Erne, and the Puny Fox grinned all across his wide face,\r\nand Hallblithe looked from one to the other of them and wondered at their\r\nmirth, and when they saw his wondering eyes, they did but laugh the more;\r\nand the Erne said: "Nevertheless, thou shalt see the gift which I would\r\ngive thee; and then mayst thou take it or leave it as thou wilt.  Ho ye!\r\nbring in the throne of the Eastland with them that minister to it!"\r\n\r\nCertain men left the hall as he spake, and came back bearing with them a\r\nthrone fashioned most goodly of ivory, parcel-gilt and begemmed, and\r\nadorned with marvellous craftsmanship: and they set it down amidst of the\r\nhall-floor and went aback to their places, while the Erne sat and smiled\r\nkindly on the folk and on Hallblithe.  Then arose the sound of fiddles\r\nand the lesser harp, and the doors of the screen were opened, and there\r\nflowed into the hall a company of fair damsels not less than a score,\r\neach one with a rose on her bosom, and they came and stood in order\r\nbehind the throne of the Eastlands, and they strewed roses on the ground\r\nbefore them: and when they were duly ranged they fell to singing:\r\n\r\n         Now waneth spring,\r\n         While all birds sing,\r\n         And the south wind blows\r\n         The earliest rose\r\n         To and fro\r\n         By the doors we know,\r\n         And the scented gale\r\n         Fills every dale.\r\n   Slow now are brooks running because of the weed,\r\n   And the thrush hath no cunning to hide her at need,\r\n   So swift as she flieth from hedge-row to tree\r\n   As one that toil trieth, and deedful must be.\r\n\r\n         And O! that at last,\r\n         All sorrows past,\r\n         This night I lay\r\n         \'Neath the oak-beams grey!\r\n         O, to wake from sleep,\r\n         To see dawn creep\r\n         Through the fruitful grove\r\n         Of the house that I love!\r\n   O! my feet to be treading the threshold once more,\r\n   O\'er which once went the leading of swords to the war!\r\n   O! my feet in the garden\'s edge under the sun,\r\n   Where the seeding grass hardens for haysel begun!\r\n\r\n         Lo, lo! the wind blows\r\n         To the heart of the Rose,\r\n         And the ship lies tied\r\n         To the haven side!\r\n         But O for the keel\r\n         The sails to feel!\r\n         And the alien ness\r\n         Growing less and less;\r\n   As down the wind driveth and thrusts through the sea\r\n   The sail-burg that striveth to turn and go free,\r\n   But the lads at the tiller they hold her in hand,\r\n   And the wind our well-willer drives fierce to the land.\r\n\r\n         We shall wend it yet,\r\n         The highway wet;\r\n         For what is this\r\n         That our bosoms kiss?\r\n         What lieth sweet\r\n         Before our feet?\r\n         What token hath come\r\n         To lead us home?\r\n   \'Tis the Rose of the garden walled round from the croft\r\n   Where the grey roof its warden steep riseth aloft,\r\n   \'Tis the Rose \'neath the oaken-beamed hall, where they bide,\r\n   The pledges unbroken, the hand of the bride.\r\n\r\nHallblithe heard the song, and half thought it promised him somewhat; but\r\nthen he had been so misled and mocked at, that he scarce knew how to\r\nrejoice at it.\r\n\r\nNow the Erne spake: "Wilt thou not take the chair and these dainty song-\r\nbirds that stand about it?  Much wealth might come into thine hall if\r\nthou wert to carry them over sea to rich men who have no kindred, nor\r\naffinity wherein to wed, but who love women as well as other men."\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "I have wealth enow were I once home again.  As to these\r\nmaidens, I know by the fashion of them that they are no women of the\r\nRose, as by their song they should be.  Yet will I take any of these\r\nmaidens that have will to go with me and be made sisters of my sisters,\r\nand wed with the warriors of the Rose; or if they are of a kindred, and\r\nlong to sit each in the house of her folk, then will we send them home\r\nover the sea with warriors to guard them from all trouble.  For this gift\r\nI thank thee.  As to thy throne, I bid thee keep it till a keel cometh\r\nthy way from our land, bringing fair gifts for thee and thine.  For we\r\nare not so unwealthy."\r\n\r\nThose that sat nearby heard his words and praised them; but the Erne\r\nsaid: "All this is free to thee, and thou mayst do what thou wilt with\r\nthe gifts given to thee.  Yet shalt thou have the throne; and I have\r\nthought of a way to make thee take it.  Or what sayst thou, Puny Fox?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Puny Fox: "Yea if thou wilt, thou mayst, but I thought it not of\r\nthee that thou wouldst.  Now is all well."\r\n\r\nAgain Hallblithe looked from one to the other and wondered what they\r\nmeant.  But the Erne cried out: "Bring in now the sitter, who shall fill\r\nthe empty throne!"\r\n\r\nThen again the screen-doors opened, and there came in two weaponed men,\r\nleading between them a woman clad in gold and garlanded with roses.  So\r\nfair was the fashion of her face and all her body, that her coming seemed\r\nto make a change in the hall, as though the sun had shone into it\r\nsuddenly.  She trod the hall-floor with firm feet, and sat down on the\r\nivory chair.  But even before she was seated therein Hallblithe knew that\r\nthe Hostage was under that roof and coming toward him.  And the heart\r\nrose in his breast and fluttered therein, so sore he yearned toward the\r\nDaughter of the Rose, and his very speech-friend.  Then he heard the Erne\r\nsaying, "How now, Raven-son, wilt thou have the throne and the sitter\r\ntherein, or wilt thou gainsay me once more?"\r\n\r\nThereafter he himself spake, and the sound of his voice was strange to\r\nhim and as if he knew it not: "Chieftain, I will not gainsay thee, but\r\nwill take thy gift, and thy friendship therewith, whatsoever hath\r\nbetided.  Yet would I say a word or two unto the woman that sitteth\r\nyonder.  For I have been straying amongst wiles and images, and mayhappen\r\nI shall yet find this to be but a dream of the night, or a beguilement of\r\nthe day."  Therewith he arose from the table, and walked slowly down the\r\nhall; but it was a near thing that he did not fall a-weeping before all\r\nthose aliens, so full his heart was.\r\n\r\nHe came and stood before the Hostage, and their eyes were upon each\r\nother, and for a little while they had no words.  Then Hallblithe began,\r\nwondering at his voice as he spake: "Art thou a woman and my\r\nspeech-friend?  For many images have mocked me, and I have been\r\nencompassed with lies, and led astray by behests that have not been\r\nfulfilled.  And the world hath become strange to me, and empty of\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\nThen she said: "Art thou verily Hallblithe?  For I also have been\r\nencompassed by lies, and beset by images of things unhelpful."\r\n\r\n"Yea," said he, "I am Hallblithe of the Ravens, wearied with desire for\r\nmy troth-plight maiden."\r\n\r\nThen came the rosy colour into the fairness of her face, as the rising\r\nsun lighteth the garden of flowers in the June morning; and she said: "If\r\nthou art Hallblithe, tell me what befell to the finger-gold-ring that my\r\nmother gave me when we were both but little."\r\n\r\nThen his face grew happy, and he smiled, and he said: "I put it for thee\r\none autumntide in the snake\'s hole in the bank above the river, amidst\r\nthe roots of the old thorn-tree, that the snake might brood it, and make\r\nthe gold grow greater; but when winter was over and we came to look for\r\nit, lo! there was neither ring nor snake, nor thorn-tree: for the flood\r\nhad washed it all away."\r\n\r\nThereat she smiled most sweetly, and whereas she had been looking on him\r\nhitherto with strained and anxious eyes, she now beheld him simply and\r\nfriendly; and she said: "O Hallblithe, I am a woman indeed, and thy\r\nspeech-friend.  This is the flesh that desireth thee, and the life that\r\nis thine, and the heart which thou rejoicest.  But now tell me, who are\r\nthese huge images around us, amongst whom I have sat thus, once in every\r\nmoon this year past, and afterwards I was taken back to the women\'s\r\nbower?  Are they men or mountain-giants?  Will they slay us, or shut us\r\nup from the light and air?  Or hast thou made peace with them?  Wilt thou\r\nthen dwell with me here, or shall we go back again to Cleveland by the\r\nSea?  And when, oh when, shall we depart?"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and said: "Quick come thy questions, beloved.  These are the\r\nfolks of the Ravagers and the Sea-eagles: they be men, though fierce and\r\nwild they be.  Our foes they have been, and have sundered us; but now are\r\nthey our friends, and have brought us together.  And to-morrow, O friend,\r\nshall we depart across the waters to Cleveland by the Sea."\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward, and was about to speak softly to him, but suddenly\r\nstarted back, and said: "There is a big, red-haired man, as big as any\r\nhere, behind thy shoulder.  Is he also a friend?  What would he with us?"\r\n\r\nSo Hallblithe turned about, and beheld the Puny Fox beside him, who took\r\nup the word and spoke, smiling as a man in great glee: "O maiden of the\r\nRose, I am Hallblithe\'s thrall, and his scholar, to unlearn the craft of\r\nlying, whereby I have done amiss towards both him and thee.  Whereof I\r\nwill tell thee all the tale soon.  But now I will say that it is true\r\nthat we depart to-morrow for Cleveland by the Sea, thou and he, and I in\r\ncompany.  Now I would ask thee, Hallblithe, if thou wouldst have me\r\nbestow this gift of thine in safe-keeping to-night, since there is an end\r\nof her sitting in the hall like a graven image: and to-morrow the way\r\nwill be long and wearisome, What sayest thou?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Hostage: "Shall I trust this man and go with him?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, thou shalt trust him," said Hallblithe, "for he is trusty.  And\r\neven were he not, it is meet for us of the Raven and the Rose to do as\r\nour worth biddeth us, and not to fear this folk.  And it behoveth us to\r\ndo after their customs since we are in their house."\r\n\r\n"That is sooth," she said; "big man, lead me out of the hall to my place.\r\nFarewell, Hallblithe, for a little while, and then shall there be no more\r\nsundering for us."\r\n\r\nTherewith she departed with the Puny Fox, and Hallblithe went back to the\r\nhigh-seat and sat down by the Erne, who laughed on him and said: "Thou\r\nhast taken my gift, and that is well: yet shall I tell thee that I would\r\nnot have given it to thee if I could have kept it for myself in such\r\nplight as thou wilt have it.  But all I could do, and the Puny Fox to\r\nhelp withal, availed me nought.  So good luck go with thine hands.  Now\r\nwill we to bed, and to-morrow I will lead thee out on thy way; for to say\r\nsooth, there be some here who are not well pleased with either thee or\r\nme; and thou knowest that words are wasted on wilful men, but that deeds\r\nmay avail somewhat."\r\n\r\nTherewith he cried out for the cup of good-night, and when it was\r\ndrunken, Hallblithe was shown to a fair shut-bed; even that wherein he\r\nhad lain aforetime; and there he went to sleep in joy, and in good liking\r\nwith all men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII: THEY GO FROM THE ISLE OF RANSOM AND COME TO CLEVELAND BY\r\nTHE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning early Hallblithe arose from his bed, and when he came into\r\nthe mid-hall, there was the Puny Fox and the Hostage with him; Hallblithe\r\nkissed her and embraced her, and she him; yet not like lovers long\r\nsundered, but as a man and maid betrothed are wont to do, for there were\r\nfolk coming and going about the hall.  Then spake the Puny Fox: "The Erne\r\nis abiding us out in the meadow yonder; for now nought will serve him but\r\nhe must needs go under the earth-collar with us.  How sayest thou, is he\r\nenough thy friend?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe, smiling on the Hostage: "What hast thou to say to it,\r\nbeloved?"\r\n\r\n"Nought at all," she said, "if thou art friend to any of these men.  I\r\nmay deem that I have somewhat against the chieftain, whereof belike this\r\nbig man may tell thee hereafter; but even so much meseemeth I have\r\nagainst this man himself, who is now become thy friend and scholar; for\r\nhe also strove for my beguilement, and that not for himself, but for\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n"True it is," said the Fox, "that I did it for another; even as yesterday\r\nI took thy mate Hallblithe out of the trap whereinto he had strayed, and\r\ncompassed his deliverance by means of the unfaithful battle; and even as\r\nI would have stolen thee for him, O Rose-maiden, if need had been; yea,\r\neven if I must have smitten into ruin the roof-tree of the Ravagers.  And\r\nhow could I tell that the Erne would give thee up unstolen?  Yea, thou\r\nsayeth sooth, O noble and spotless maiden; all my deeds, both good and\r\nill, have I done for others; and so I deem it shall be while my life\r\nlasteth."\r\n\r\nThen Hallblithe laughed and said: "Art thou nettled, fellow-in-arms, at\r\nthe word of a woman who knoweth thee not?  She shall yet be thy friend, O\r\nFox.  But tell me, beloved, I deemed that thou hadst not seen Fox before;\r\nhow then can he have helped the Erne against thee?"\r\n\r\n"Yet she sayeth sooth," said Fox, "this was of my sleight: for when I had\r\nto come before her, I changed my skin, as I well know how; there are\r\nothers in this land who can do so much as that.  But what sayest thou\r\nconcerning the brotherhood with the Erne?"\r\n\r\n"Let it be so," said Hallblithe, "he is manly and true, though masterful,\r\nand is meet for this land of his.  I shall not fall out with him; for\r\nseldom meseemeth shall I see the Isle of Ransom."\r\n\r\n"And I never again," said the Puny Fox.\r\n\r\n"Dost thou loathe it, then," said the Hostage, "because of the evil thou\r\nhast done therein?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said he, "what is the evil, when henceforth I shall do but good?\r\nNay, I love the land.  Belike thou deemest it but dreary with its black\r\nrocks and black sand, and treeless wind-swept dales; but I know it in\r\nsummer and winter, and sun and shade, in storm and calm.  And I know\r\nwhere the fathers dwelt and the sons of their sons\' sons have long lain\r\nin the earth.  I have sailed its windiest firths, and climbed its\r\nsteepest crags; and ye may well wot that it hath a friendly face to me;\r\nand the land-wights of the mountains will be sorry for my departure."\r\n\r\nSo he spake, and Hallblithe would have answered him, but by now were they\r\ncome to a grassy hollow amidst the dale, where the Erne had already made\r\nthe earth-yoke ready.  To wit, he had loosened a strip of turf all save\r\nthe two ends, and had propped it up with two ancient dwarf-wrought\r\nspears, so that amidmost there was a lintel to go under.\r\n\r\nSo when he saw those others coming, he gave them the sele of the day, and\r\nsaid to Hallblithe: "What is it to be? shall I be less than thy brother-\r\nin-arms henceforward?"\r\n\r\nSaid Hallblithe: "Not a whit less.  It is good to have brothers in other\r\nlands than one."\r\n\r\nSo they made no delay, but clad in all their war-gear, they went under\r\nthe earth-yoke one after the other; thereafter they stood together, and\r\neach let blood in his arm, so that the blood of all three mingled\r\ntogether fell down on the grass of the ancient earth; and they swore\r\nfriendship and brotherhood each to each.\r\n\r\nBut when all was done the Erne spake: "Brother Hallblithe, as I lay awake\r\nin bed this morning I deemed that I would take ship with thee to\r\nCleveland by the Sea, that I might dwell there a while.  But when I came\r\nout of the hall, and saw the dale lying green betwixt hill-side and hill-\r\nside, and the glittering river running down amidmost, and the sheep and\r\nkine and horses feeding up and down on either side the water: and I\r\nlooked up at the fells and saw how deep blue they stood up against the\r\nsnowy peaks, and I thought of all our deeds on the deep sea, and the\r\nmerry nights, in yonder abode of men: then I thought that I would not\r\nleave the kindred, were it but for a while, unless war and lifting called\r\nme.  So now I will ride with thee to the ship, and then farewell to\r\nthee."\r\n\r\n"It is good," said Hallblithe, "though not as good as it might be.  Glad\r\nhad we been with thee in the hall of the Ravens."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke drew anigh the carles leading the horses, and with them came\r\nsix of those damsels whom the Erne had given to Hallblithe the night\r\nbefore; two of whom asked to be brought to their kindred over sea; but\r\nthe other four were fain to go with Hallblithe and the Hostage, and\r\nbecome their sisters at Cleveland by the Sea.\r\n\r\nSo then they got to horse and rode down the dale toward the haven, and\r\nthe carles rode with them, so that of weaponed men they were a score in\r\ncompany.  But when they were half-way to the haven they saw where hard by\r\nthree knolls on the way-side were men standing with their weapons and war-\r\ngear glittering in the sun.  So the Erne laughed and said: "Shall we have\r\na word with War-brand then?"\r\n\r\nBut they rode steadily on their way, and when they came up to the knolls\r\nthey saw that it was War-brand indeed with a score of men at his back;\r\nbut they stirred not when they saw Erne\'s company that it was great.  Then\r\nErne laughed aloud and cried out in a big voice, "What, lads! ye ride\r\nearly this morning; are there foemen abroad in the Isle?"\r\n\r\nThey shrank back before him, but a carle of those who was hindermost\r\ncried out: "Art thou coming back to us, Erne, or have thy new friends\r\nbought thee to lead them in battle?"\r\n\r\n"Fear it nought," quoth Erne, "I shall be back before the shepherd\'s\r\nnoon."\r\n\r\nSo they went their ways and came to the haven, and there lay the Flaming\r\nSword, and beside her a trim bark, not right great, all ready for sea:\r\nand Hallblithe\'s skiff was made fast to her for an after-boat.\r\n\r\nThen the Hostage and Hallblithe and the six damsels went aboard her, and\r\nwhen the Erne had bidden them farewell, they cast off the hawsers and\r\nthrust her out through the haven-mouth; but ere they had got midmost of\r\nthe haven, they saw the Erne, that he had turned about, and was riding up\r\nthe dale with his house-carles, and each man\'s weapon was shining in his\r\nhand: and they wondered if he were riding to battle with War-brand; and\r\nFox said: "Meseemeth our brother-in-arms hath in his mind to give those\r\nwaylayers an evil minute, and verily he is the man to do the same."\r\n\r\nSo they gat them out of the haven, and the ebb-tide drave out seaward\r\nstrongly, and the wind was fair for Cleveland by the Sea; and they ran\r\nspeedily past the black cliffs of the Isle of Ransom, and soon were they\r\nhull down behind them.  But on the afternoon of the next day they hove up\r\nthe land of the kindreds, and by sunset they beached their ship on the\r\nsand by the Rollers of the Raven, and went ashore without more ado.  And\r\nthe strand was empty of all men, even as on the day when Hallblithe first\r\nmet the Puny Fox.  So then in the cool of the evening they went up toward\r\nthe House of the Raven.  Those damsels went together hand in hand two by\r\ntwo, and Hallblithe held the Hostage by the hand; but the Puny Fox went\r\nalong beside them, gleeful and of many words; telling them tales of his\r\nwiles and his craft, and his skin-changing.\r\n\r\n"But now," quoth he, "I have left all that behind me in the Isle of\r\nRansom, and have but one shape, and I would for your behoof that it were\r\na goodlier one: and but one wisdom have I, even that which dwelleth in\r\nmine own head-bone.  Yet it may be that this may avail you one time or\r\nother.  But lo you! though I am thy thrall, have I not the look of a\r\nthrall-huckster from over sea leading up my wares to the cheaping-stead?"\r\nThey laughed at his words and were merry, and much love there was amongst\r\nthem as they went up to the House of the Raven.\r\n\r\nBut when they came thither they went into the garth, and there was no man\r\ntherein, for it was now dusk, and the windows of the long hall were\r\nyellow with candle-light.  Then said Fox: "Abide ye here a little; for I\r\nwould go into the hall alone and see the conditions of thy people, O\r\nHallblithe."\r\n\r\n"Go thou, then," said Hallblithe, "but be not rash.  I counsel thee; for\r\nour folk are not over-patient when they deem they have a foe before\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nThe Puny Fox laughed, and said: "So it is then the world over, that happy\r\nmen are wilful and masterful."\r\n\r\nThen he drew his sword and smote on the door with the pommel, and the\r\ndoor opened to him and in he went: and he found that fair hall full of\r\nfolk and bright with candles; and he stood amidst the floor; all men\r\nlooked on him, and many knew him at once to be a man of the Ravagers, and\r\nsilence fell upon the hall, but no man stirred hand against him.  Then he\r\nsaid: "Will ye hearken to the word of an evil man, a robber of the\r\nfolks?"\r\n\r\nSpake the chieftain from the dais: "Words will not hurt us, sea-warrior;\r\nand thou art but one among many; wherefore thy might this eve is but as\r\nthe might of a new-born baby.  Speak, and afterwards eat and drink, and\r\ndepart safe from amongst us!"\r\n\r\nSpake the Puny Fox: "What is gone with Hallblithe, a fair young man of\r\nyour kindred, and with the Hostage of the Rose, his troth-plight maiden?"\r\n\r\nThen was the hush yet greater in the hall, so that you might have heard a\r\npin drop; and the chieftain said: "It is a grief of ours that they are\r\ngone, and that none hath brought us back their dead bodies that we might\r\nlay them in the Acre of the Fathers."\r\n\r\nThen leapt up a man from the end-long table nigh to Fox, and cried out:\r\n"Yea, folk! they are gone, and we deem that runagates of thy kindred, O\r\nnew-come man, have stolen them from us; wherefor they shall one day pay\r\nus."\r\n\r\nThen laughed the Puny Fox and said: "Some would say that stealing\r\nHallblithe was like stealing a lion, and that he might take care of\r\nhimself; though he was not as big as I am."\r\n\r\nSaid the last speaker: "Did thy kin or didst thou steal him, O evil man?"\r\n\r\n"Yea, I stole him," quoth Fox, "but by sleight, and not by might."\r\n\r\nThen uprose great uproar in the hall, but the chieftain on the high-seat\r\ncried out: "Peace, peace!" and the noise abated, and the chieftain said:\r\n"Dost thou mean that thou comest hither to give us thine head for making\r\naway with Hallblithe and the Hostage?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to ask rather," said the Fox, "what thou wilt give me for the\r\nbodies of these twain?"\r\n\r\nSaid the chieftain: "A boat-load of gold were not too much if thou\r\nshouldst live a little longer."\r\n\r\nQuoth the Puny Fox: "Well, in anywise I will go and bring in the bodies\r\naforesaid, and leave my reward to the goodwill of the Ravens."\r\n\r\nTherewith he turned about to go, but lo! there already in the door stood\r\nHallblithe holding the Hostage by the hand; and many in the hall saw\r\nthem, for the door was wide.  Then they came in and stood by the side of\r\nthe Puny Fox, and all men in the hall arose and shouted for joy.  But\r\nwhen the tumult was a little abated, the Puny Fox cried out: "O\r\nchieftain, and all ye folk! if a boat-load of gold were not too much\r\nreward for the bringing back the dead bodies of your friends, what reward\r\nshall he have who hath brought back their bodies and the souls therein?"\r\n\r\nSaid the chieftain: "The man shall choose his own reward."  And the men\r\nin the hall shouted their yeasay.\r\n\r\nThen said the Puny Fox: "Well, then, this I choose, that ye make me one\r\nof your kindred before the fathers of old time."\r\n\r\nThey all cried out that he had chosen wisely and manfully; but Hallblithe\r\nsaid: "I bid you do for him no less than this; and ye shall wot that he\r\nis already my sworn brother-in-arms."\r\n\r\nNow the chieftain cried out: "O Wanderers from over the sea, come up\r\nhither and sit with us and be merry at last!"\r\n\r\nSo they went up to the dais, Hallblithe and the Hostage, and the Puny Fox\r\nand the six maidens withal.  And since the night was yet young, the\r\nsupper of the men of the Ravens was turned into the wedding-feast of\r\nHallblithe and the Hostage, and that very night she became a wife of the\r\nRavens, that she might bear to the House the best of men and the fairest\r\nof women.\r\n\r\nBut on the morrow they brought the Puny Fox to the mote-stead of the\r\nkindreds that he might stand before the fathers and be made a son of the\r\nkindred; and this they did because of the word of Hallblithe, and because\r\nthey believed in the tale which he told them of the Glittering Plain and\r\nthe Acre of the Undying.  The four maidens also were made sisters of the\r\nHouse; and the other twain were sent home to their own kindred in all\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nOf the Puny Fox it is said that he soon lost and forgot all the lore\r\nwhich he had learned of the ancient men, living and dead; and became as\r\nother men and was no wizard.  Yet he was exceeding valiant and doughty;\r\nand he ceased not to go with Hallblithe wheresoever he went; and many\r\ndeeds they did together, whereof the memory of men hath failed: but\r\nneither they nor any man of the Ravens came any more to the Glittering\r\nPlain, or heard any tidings of the folk that dwell there.\r\n\r\nHEREWITH ENDETH THE TALE.\r\n\r\nPrinted by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\nat Paul\'s Work, Edinburgh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF THE GLITTERING PLAIN***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 2565.txt or 2565.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/5/6/2565\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
