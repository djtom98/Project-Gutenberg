Six times had the darkness\r\nclosed over a wild and terrific scene, and returning light as often\r\nbrought but renewed distress, for the raging storm increased in fury\r\nuntil on the seventh day all hope was lost.\r\n\r\nWe were driven completely out of our course; no conjecture could be\r\nformed as to our whereabouts. The crew had lost heart, and were utterly\r\nexhausted by incessant labor.\r\n\r\nThe riven masts had gone by the board, leaks had been sprung in every\r\ndirection, and the water, which rushed in, gained upon us rapidly.\r\n\r\nInstead of reckless oaths, the seamen now uttered frantic cries to God\r\nfor mercy, mingled with strange and often ludicrous vows, to be\r\nperformed should deliverance be granted.\r\n\r\nEvery man on board alternately commended his soul to his Creator, and\r\nstrove to bethink himself of some means of saving his life.\r\n\r\nMy heart sank as I looked round upon my family in the midst of these\r\nhorrors. Our four young sons were overpowered by terror. "Dear\r\nchildren," said I, "if the Lord will, he can save us even from this\r\nfearful peril; if not, let us calmly yield our lives into his hand, and\r\nthink of the joy and blessedness of finding ourselves forever and ever\r\nunited in that happy home above."\r\n\r\nAt these words my weeping wife looked bravely up, and, as the boys\r\nclustered round her, she began to cheer and encourage them with calm and\r\nloving words. I rejoiced to see her fortitude, though my heart was ready\r\nto break as I gazed on my dear ones.\r\n\r\nWe knelt down together, one after another praying with deep earnestness\r\nand emotion. Fritz, in particular, besought help and deliverance for his\r\ndear parents and brothers, as though quite forgetting himself.\r\n\r\nOur hearts were soothed by the never-failing comfort of child-like,\r\nconfiding prayer, and the horror of our situation seemed less\r\noverwhelming. "Ah," thought I, "the Lord will hear our prayer! He will\r\nhelp us."\r\n\r\nAmid the roar of the thundering waves I suddenly heard the cry of "Land,\r\nland!" while at the same instant the ship struck with a frightful shock,\r\nwhich threw every one to the deck, and seemed to threaten her immediate\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nDreadful sounds betokened the breaking up of the ship, and the roaring\r\nwaters poured in on all sides:\r\n\r\nThen the voice of the captain was heard above the tumult shouting,\r\n"Lower away the boats! We are lost!"\r\n\r\n"Lost!" I exclaimed, and the word went like a dagger to my heart; but\r\nseeing my children\'s terror renewed, I composed myself, calling out\r\ncheerfully, "Take courage, my boys! we are all above water yet. There is\r\nthe land not far off; let us do our best to reach it. You know God\r\nhelps those that help themselves!" With that, I left them and went on\r\ndeck. What was my horror when through the foam and spray I beheld the\r\nonly remaining boat leave the ship, the last of the seamen spring into\r\nher and push off, regardless of my cries and entreaties that we might be\r\nallowed to share their slender chance of preserving their lives. My\r\nvoice was drowned in the howling of the blast; and even had the crew\r\nwished it, the return of the boat was impossible.\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes despairingly around, I became gradually aware that our\r\nposition was by no means hopeless, inasmuch as the stern of the ship\r\ncontaining our cabin was jammed between two high rocks, and was partly\r\nraised from among the breakers which dashed the forepart to pieces. As\r\nthe clouds of mist and rain drove past, I could make out, through rents\r\nin the vaporous curtain, a line of rocky coast, and rugged as it was, my\r\nheart bounded toward it as a sign of help in the hour of need. Yet the\r\nsense of our lonely and forsaken condition weighed heavily upon me as I\r\nreturned to my family, constraining myself to say with a smile,\r\n"Courage, dear ones! Although our good ship will never sail more, she is\r\nso placed that our cabin will remain above water, and to-morrow, if the\r\nwind and waves abate, I see no reason why we should not be able to get\r\nashore."\r\n\r\nThese few words had an immediate effect on the spirits of my children,\r\nwho at once regarded our problematical chance of escaping as a happy\r\ncertainty, and began to enjoy the relief from the violent pitching and\r\nrolling of the vessel.\r\n\r\nMy wife, however, perceived my distress and anxiety, in spite of my\r\nforced composure, and I made her comprehend our real situation, greatly\r\nfearing the effect of the intelligence on her nerves. Not for a moment\r\ndid her courage and trust in Providence forsake her, and on seeing this,\r\nmy fortitude revived.\r\n\r\n"We must find some food, and take a good supper," said she, "it will\r\nnever do to grow faint by fasting too long. We shall require our utmost\r\nstrength to-morrow."\r\n\r\nNight drew on apace, the storm was as fierce as ever, and at intervals\r\nwe were startled by crashes announcing further damage to our unfortunate\r\nship.\r\n\r\n"God will help us soon now, won\'t he, father?" said my youngest child.\r\n\r\n"You silly little thing," said Fritz, my eldest son, sharply, "don\'t you\r\nknow that we must not settle what God is to do for us? We must have\r\npatience and wait his time."\r\n\r\n"Very well said, had it been said kindly, Fritz, my boy. You too often\r\nspeak harshly to your brothers, although you may not mean to do so."\r\n\r\nA good meal being now ready, my youngsters ate heartily, and retiring to\r\nrest were speedily fast asleep. Fritz, who was of an age to be aware of\r\nthe real danger we were in, kept watch with us. After a long silence,\r\n"Father," said he, "don\'t you think we might contrive swimming belts for\r\nmother and the boys? with those we might all escape to land, for you and\r\nI can swim."\r\n\r\n"Your idea is so good," answered I, "that I shall arrange something at\r\nonce, in case of an accident during the night."\r\n\r\nWe immediately searched about for what would answer the purpose, and\r\nfortunately got hold of a number of empty flasks and tin canisters,\r\nwhich we connected two and two together so as to form floats\r\nsufficiently buoyant to support a person in the water, and my wife and\r\nyoung sons each willingly put one on. I then provided myself with\r\nmatches, knives, cord, and other portable articles, trusting that,\r\nshould the vessel go to pieces before daylight, we might gain the shore\r\nnot wholly destitute.\r\n\r\nFritz, as well as his brothers, now slept soundly. Throughout the night\r\nmy wife and I maintained our prayerful watch, dreading at every fresh\r\nsound some fatal change in the position of the wreck.\r\n\r\nAt length the faint dawn of day appeared, the long, weary night was\r\nover, and with thankful hearts we perceived that the gale had began to\r\nmoderate; blue sky was seen above us, and the lovely hues of sunrise\r\nadorned the eastern horizon.\r\n\r\nI aroused the boys, and we assembled on the remaining portion of the\r\ndeck, when they, to their surprise, discovered that no one else was on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, papa! what has become of everybody? Are the sailors gone? Have\r\nthey taken away the boats? Oh, papa! why did they leave us behind? What\r\ncan we do by ourselves?"\r\n\r\n"My good children," I replied, "we must not despair, although we seem\r\ndeserted. See how those on whose skill and good faith we depended have\r\nleft us cruelly to our fate in the hour of danger. God will never do so.\r\nHe has not forsaken us, and we will trust him still. Only let us bestir\r\nourselves, and each cheerily do his best. Who has anything to propose?"\r\n\r\n"The sea will soon be calm enough for swimming," said Fritz.\r\n\r\n"And that would be all very fine for you," exclaimed Ernest, "but think\r\nof mother and the rest of us! Why not build a raft and all get on shore\r\ntogether?"\r\n\r\n"We should find it difficult, I think, to make a raft that would carry\r\nus safe to shore. However, we must contrive something, and first let\r\neach try to procure what will be of most use to us."\r\n\r\nAway we all went to see what was to be found, I myself proceeding to\r\nexamine, as of great consequence, the supplies of provisions and fresh\r\nwater within our reach.\r\n\r\nMy wife took her youngest son, Franz, to help her to feed the\r\nunfortunate animals on board, who were in a pitiful plight, having been\r\nneglected for several days.\r\n\r\nFritz hastened to the arm chest, Ernest to look for tools: and Jack went\r\ntoward the captain\'s cabin, the door of which he no sooner opened than\r\nout sprang two splendid large dogs, who testified their extreme delight\r\nand gratitude by such tremendous bounds that they knocked their little\r\ndeliverer completely head over heels, frightening him nearly out of his\r\nwits. Jack did not long yield either to fear or anger; he presently\r\nrecovered himself; the dogs seemed to ask pardon by vehemently licking\r\nhis face and hands, and so, seizing the larger by the ears, he jumped on\r\nhis back, and, to my great amusement, coolly rode to meet me as I came\r\nup the hatchway.\r\n\r\nWhen we reassembled in the cabin, we all displayed our treasures.\r\n\r\nFritz brought a couple of guns, shot belt, powder flasks, and plenty of\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nErnest produced a cap full of nails, an ax, and a hammer, while pincers,\r\nchisels, and augers stuck out of all his pockets.\r\n\r\nLittle Franz carried a box, and eagerly began to show us the "nice sharp\r\nlittle hooks" it contained. "Well done, Franz!" cried I; "these fish\r\nhooks, which you, the youngest, have found, may contribute more than\r\nanything else in the ship to save our lives by procuring food for us.\r\nFritz and Ernest, you have chosen well."\r\n\r\n"Will you praise me too?" said my dear wife. "I have nothing to show,\r\nbut I can give you good news. Some useful animals are still alive; a\r\ncow, a donkey, two goats, six sheep, a ram, and a fine sow. I was but\r\njust in time to save their lives by taking food to them."\r\n\r\n"All these things are excellent indeed," said I; "but my friend Jack\r\nhere has presented me with a couple of huge, hungry, useless dogs, who\r\nwill eat more than any of us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa! they will be of use! Why, they will help us to hunt when we\r\nget on shore!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt they will, if ever we do get on shore, Jack; but I must say I\r\ndon\'t know how it is to be done."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t we each get into a big tub, and float there?" returned he. "I\r\nhave often sailed splendidly like that, round the pond at home."\r\n\r\n"My child, you have hit on a capital idea," cried I. "Now, Ernest, let\r\nme have your tools, hammers, nails, saws, augers, and ax; and then make\r\nhaste to collect any tubs you can find!"\r\n\r\nWe very soon found four large casks, made of sound wood, and strongly\r\nbound with iron hoops; they were floating with many other things in the\r\nwater in the hold, but we managed to fish them out, and drag them to a\r\nsuitable place for launching them. They were exactly what I wanted, and\r\nI succeeded in sawing them across the middle. Hard work it was, and we\r\nwere glad enough to stop and refresh ourselves with wine and biscuits.\r\n\r\nMy eight tubs now stood ranged in a row near the water\'s edge, and I\r\nlooked at them with great satisfaction; to my surprise, my wife did not\r\nseem to share my pleasure!\r\n\r\n"I shall never," said she, "muster courage to get into one of these!"\r\n\r\n"Do not be too sure of that, dear wife; when you see my contrivance\r\ncompleted, you will perhaps prefer it to this immovable wreck."\r\n\r\nI next procured a long, thin plank, on which my tubs could be fixed, and\r\nthe two ends of this I bent upward so as to form a keel. Other two\r\nplanks were nailed along the sides of the tubs; they also being\r\nflexible, were brought to a point at each end, and all firmly secured\r\nand nailed together. I felt satisfied that in smooth water this craft\r\nwould be perfectly trustworthy. But when we thought all was ready for\r\nthe launch, we found, to our dismay, that the grand contrivance was so\r\nheavy and clumsy, that even our united efforts could not move it an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n"I must have a lever," cried I. "Run and fetch the capstan bar!"\r\n\r\nFritz quickly brought one, and, having formed rollers by cutting up a\r\nlong spar, I raised the fore part of my boat with the bar, and my sons\r\nplaced a roller under it.\r\n\r\n"How is it, father," inquired Ernest, "that with that thing you alone\r\ncan do more than all of us together?"\r\n\r\nI explained, as well as I could in a hurry, the principle of the lever;\r\nand promised to have a long talk on the subject of Mechanics, should we\r\nhave a future opportunity.\r\n\r\nI now made fast a long rope to the stern of our boat, attaching the\r\nother end to a beam; then placing a second and third roller under it, we\r\nonce more began to push, this time with success, and soon our gallant\r\ncraft was safely launched: so swiftly indeed did she glide into the\r\nwater that, but for the rope, she would have passed beyond our reach.\r\nThe boys wished to jump in directly; but, alas, she leaned so much on\r\none side that they could not venture to do so.\r\n\r\nSome heavy things being thrown in, however, the boat righted itself by\r\ndegrees, and the boys were so delighted that they struggled which should\r\nfirst leap in to have the fun of sitting down in the tubs. But it was\r\nplain to me at once that something more was required to make her\r\nperfectly safe, so I contrived out-riggers to preserve the balance, by\r\nnailing long poles across at the stem and stern, and fixing at the end\r\nof each empty brandy casks. Then the boat appearing steady, I got in;\r\nand turning it toward the most open side of the wreck, I cut and cleared\r\naway obstructions, so as to leave a free passage for our departure, and\r\nthe boys brought oars to be ready for the voyage. This important\r\nundertaking we were forced to postpone until the next day, as it was by\r\nthis time far too late to attempt it. It was not pleasant to have to\r\nspend another night in so precarious a situation; but yielding to\r\nnecessity, we sat down to enjoy a comfortable supper, for during our\r\nexciting and incessant work all day we had taken nothing but an\r\noccasional biscuit and a little wine.\r\n\r\nWe prepared for rest in a much happier frame of mind than on the\r\npreceding day, but I did not forget the possibility of a renewed storm,\r\nand therefore made every one put on the belts as before.\r\n\r\nI persuaded my wife (not without considerable difficulty), to put on a\r\nsailor\'s dress, assuring her she would find it much more comfortable and\r\nconvenient for all she would have to go through. She at last consented\r\nto do this, and left us for a short time, reappearing with much\r\nembarrassment and many blushes, in a most becoming suit, which she had\r\nfound in a midshipman\'s chest. We all admired her costume, and any\r\nawkwardness she felt soon began to pass off; then retiring to our\r\nberths, peaceful sleep prepared us all for the exertions of the coming\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWe rose up betimes, for sleep weighs lightly on the hopeful, as well as\r\non the anxious. After kneeling together in prayer, "Now, my beloved\r\nones," said I, "with God\'s help we are about to effect our escape. Let\r\nthe poor animals we must leave behind be well fed, and put plenty of\r\nfodder within their reach: in a few days we may be able to return, and\r\nsave them likewise. After that, collect everything you can think of\r\nwhich may be of use to us."\r\n\r\nThe boys joyfully obeyed me, and I selected from the large quantity of\r\nstores they got together, canvas to make a tent, a chest of carpenter\'s\r\ntools, guns, pistols, powder, shot, and bullets, rods and fishing\r\ntackle, an iron pot, a case of portable soup, and another of biscuit.\r\nThese useful articles, of course, took the place of the ballast I had\r\nhastily thrown in the day before.\r\n\r\nWith a hearty prayer for God\'s blessing, we now began to take our seats,\r\neach in his tub. Just then we heard the cocks begin to crow, as though\r\nto reproach us for deserting them. "Why should not the fowls go with\r\nus!" exclaimed I. "If we find no food for _them_, they can be food for\r\n_us_!" Ten hens and a couple of cocks were accordingly placed in one of\r\nthe tubs, and secured with some wire-netting over them.\r\n\r\nThe ducks and geese were set at liberty, and took to the water at once,\r\nwhile the pigeons, rejoicing to find themselves on the wing, swiftly\r\nmade for the shore. My wife, who managed all this for me, kept us\r\nwaiting for her some little time, and came at last with a bag as big as\r\na pillow in her arms. "This is _my_ contribution," said she, throwing\r\nthe bag to little Franz, to be, as I thought, a cushion for him to sit\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nAll being ready, we cast off, and moved away from the wreck. My good,\r\nbrave wife sat in the first compartment of the boat; next her was Franz,\r\na pretty little boy, nearly eight years old. Then came Fritz, a\r\nhandsome, spirited young fellow of fifteen; the two center tubs\r\ncontained the valuable cargo; then came our bold, thoughtless Jack; next\r\nhim Ernest, my second son, intelligent, well-formed, and rather\r\nindolent. I myself, the anxious, loving father, stood in the stern,\r\nendeavoring to guide the raft with its precious burden to a safe\r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nThe elder boys took the oars; every one wore a float belt, and had\r\nsomething useful close to him in case of being thrown into the water.\r\n\r\nThe tide was flowing, which was a great help to the young oarsmen. We\r\nemerged from the wreck and glided into the open sea. All eyes were\r\nstrained to get a full view of the land, and the boys pulled with a\r\nwill; but for some time we made no progress, as the boat kept turning\r\nround and round, until I hit upon the right way to steer it, after which\r\nwe merrily made for the shore.\r\n\r\nWe had left two dogs, Turk and Juno, on the wreck, as being both large\r\nmastiffs we did not care to have their additional weight on board our\r\ncraft; but when they saw us apparently deserting them, they set up a\r\npiteous howl, and sprang into the sea. I was sorry to see this, for the\r\ndistance to the land was so great that I scarcely expected them to be\r\nable to accomplish it. They followed us, however, and occasionally\r\nresting their fore-paws on the out-riggers, kept up with us well. Jack\r\nwas inclined to deny them this, their only chance of safety. "Stop,"\r\nsaid I, "that would be unkind as well as foolish; remember, the merciful\r\nman regardeth the life of his beast."\r\n\r\nOur passage, though tedious, was safe; but the nearer we approached the\r\nshore the less inviting it appeared; the barren rocks seemed to threaten\r\nus with misery and want.\r\n\r\nMany casks, boxes, and bales of goods floated on the water around us.\r\nFritz and I managed to secure a couple of hogsheads, so as to tow them\r\nalongside. With the prospect of famine before us, it was desirable to\r\nlay hold of anything likely to contain provisions.\r\n\r\nBy and by we began to perceive that, between and beyond the cliffs,\r\ngreen grass and trees were discernible. Fritz could distinguish many\r\ntall palms, and Ernest hoped they would prove to be cocoanut trees, and\r\nenjoyed the thoughts of drinking the refreshing milk.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry I never thought of bringing away the captain\'s\r\ntelescope," said I.\r\n\r\n"Oh, look here, father!" cried Jack, drawing a little spyglass joyfully\r\nout of his pocket.\r\n\r\nBy means of this glass, I made out that at some distance to the left the\r\ncoast was much more inviting; a strong current however, carried us\r\ndirectly toward the frowning rocks, but I presently observed an opening,\r\nwhere a stream flowed into the sea, and saw that our geese and ducks\r\nwere swimming toward this place. I steered after them into the creek,\r\nand we found ourselves in a small bay or inlet where the water was\r\nperfectly smooth and of moderate depth. The ground sloped gently upward\r\nfrom the low banks to the cliffs, which here retired inland, leaving a\r\nsmall plain, on which it was easy for us to land. Every one sprang\r\ngladly out of the boat but little Franz, who, lying packed in his tub\r\nlike a potted shrimp, had to be lifted out by his mother.\r\n\r\nThe dogs had scrambled on shore before us; they received us with loud\r\nbarking and the wildest demonstrations of delight. The geese and ducks\r\nkept up an incessant din, added to which was the screaming and croaking\r\nof flamingoes and penguins, whose dominion we were invading. The noise\r\nwas deafening, but far from unwelcome to me, as I thought of the good\r\ndinners the birds might furnish.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we could gather our children around us on dry land, we knelt\r\nto offer thanks and praise for our merciful escape, and with full\r\nhearts we commended ourselves to God\'s good keeping for the time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAll hands then briskly fell to the work of unloading, and oh, how rich\r\nwe felt ourselves as we did so! The poultry we left at liberty to forage\r\nfor themselves, and set about finding a suitable place to erect a tent\r\nin which to pass the night. This we speedily did; thrusting a long spar\r\ninto a hole in the rock, and supporting the other end by a pole firmly\r\nplanted in the ground, we formed a framework over which we stretched the\r\nsailcloth we had brought; besides fastening this down with pegs, we\r\nplaced our heavy chest and boxes on the border of the canvas, and\r\narranged hooks so as to be able to close up the entrance during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWhen this was accomplished, the boys ran to collect moss and grass, to\r\nspread in the tent for our beds, while I arranged a fireplace with some\r\nlarge flat stones, near the brook which flowed close by. Dry twigs and\r\nseaweed were soon in a blaze on the hearth; I filled the iron pot with\r\nwater, and giving my wife several cakes of the portable soup, she\r\nestablished herself as our cook, with little Franz to help her.\r\n\r\nHe, thinking his mother was melting some glue for carpentering, was\r\neager to know "what papa was going to make next?"\r\n\r\n"This is to be soup for your dinner, my child. Do you think these cakes\r\nlook like glue?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed I do!" replied Franz, "and I should not much like to taste\r\nglue soup! don\'t you want some beef or mutton, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Where can I get it, dear!" said she, "we are a long way from a\r\nbutcher\'s shop! but these cakes are made of the juice of good meat,\r\nboiled till it becomes a strong, stiff jelly--people take them when they\r\ngo to sea, because on a long voyage they can only have salt meat, which\r\nwill not make nice soup."\r\n\r\nFritz, meanwhile, leaving a loaded gun with me, took another himself,\r\nand went along the rough coast to see what lay beyond the stream; this\r\nfatiguing sort of walk not suiting Ernest\'s fancy, he sauntered down to\r\nthe beach, and Jack scrambled among the rocks, searching for shell-fish.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to land the two casks which were floating alongside our\r\nboat, but on attempting to do so, I found that I could not get them up\r\nthe bank on which we had landed, and was therefore obliged to look for a\r\nmore convenient spot. As I did so, I was startled by hearing Jack\r\nshouting for help, as though in great danger. He was at some distance,\r\nand I hurried toward him with a hatchet in my hand. The little fellow\r\nstood screaming in a deep pool, and as I approached, I saw that a huge\r\nlobster had caught his leg in its powerful claw. Poor Jack was in a\r\nterrible fright; kick as he would, his enemy still clung on. I waded\r\ninto the water, and seizing the lobster firmly by the back, managed to\r\nmake it loosen its hold, and we brought it safe to land. Jack, having\r\nspeedily recovered his spirits, and anxious to take such a prize to his\r\nmother, caught the lobster in both hands, but instantly received such a\r\nsevere blow from its tail that he flung it down, and passionately hit\r\nthe creature with a large stone. This display of temper vexed me. "You\r\nare acting in a very childish way, my son," said I; "never strike an\r\nenemy in a revengeful spirit." Once more lifting the lobster, Jack ran\r\ntriumphantly toward the tent.\r\n\r\n"Mother, mother! a lobster, Ernest! look here, Franz! mind, he\'ll bite\r\nyou! Where\'s Fritz?" All came crowding round Jack and his prize,\r\nwondering at its unusual size, and Ernest wanted his mother to make\r\nlobster soup directly, by adding it to what she was now boiling.\r\n\r\nShe, however, begged to decline making any such experiment, and said she\r\npreferred cooking one dish at a time. Having remarked that the scene of\r\nJack\'s adventure afforded a convenient place for getting my casks on\r\nshore, I returned thither and succeeded in drawing them up on the beach,\r\nwhere I set them on end, and for the present left them.\r\n\r\nOn my return I resumed the subject of Jack\'s lobster, and told him he\r\nshould have the offending claw all to himself, when it was ready to be\r\neaten, congratulating him on being the first to discover anything\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n"As to that," said Ernest, "I found something very good to eat, as well\r\nas Jack, only I could not get at them without wetting my feet."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" cried Jack, "I know what he saw--nothing but some nasty mussels;\r\nI saw them too. Who wants to eat trash like that! Lobster for me!"\r\n\r\n"I believe them to be oysters, not mussels," returned Ernest calmly.\r\n\r\n"Be good enough, my philosophical young friend, to fetch a few specimens\r\nof these oysters in time for our next meal," said I; "we must all exert\r\nourselves, Ernest, for the common good, and pray never let me hear you\r\nobject to wetting your feet. See how quickly the sun has dried Jack and\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I can bring some salt at the same time," said Ernest, "I remarked a\r\ngood deal lying in the crevices of the rocks; it tasted very pure and\r\ngood, and I concluded it was produced by the evaporation of sea water in\r\nthe sun."\r\n\r\n"Extremely probable, learned sir," cried I; "but if you had brought a\r\nbagful of this good salt instead of merely speculating so profoundly on\r\nthe subject, it would have been more to the purpose. Run and fetch some\r\ndirectly."\r\n\r\nIt proved to be salt sure enough, although so impure that it seemed\r\nuseless, till my wife dissolved and strained it, when it became fit to\r\nput in the soup.\r\n\r\n"Why not use the sea water itself?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n"Because," said Ernest, "it is not only salt, but bitter too. Just try\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Now," said my wife, tasting the soup with the stick with which she had\r\nbeen stirring it, "dinner is ready, but where can Fritz be?" she\r\ncontinued, a little anxiously.\r\n\r\n"How are we to eat our soup when he does come?" I asked; "we have\r\nneither plates nor spoons, and we can scarcely lift the boiling pot to\r\nour mouths. We are in as uncomfortable a position as was the fox to\r\nwhom the stork served up a dinner in a jug with a long neck."\r\n\r\n"Oh, for a few cocoanut shells!" sighed Ernest.\r\n\r\n"Oh, for half a dozen plates and as many silver spoons!" rejoined I,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Really though, oyster-shells would do," said he, after a moment\'s\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"True, that is an idea worth having! Off with you, my boys; get the\r\noysters and clean out a few shells. What though our spoons have no\r\nhandles, and we do burn our fingers a little in baling the soup out."\r\n\r\nJack was away and up to his knees in the water, in a moment, detaching\r\nthe oysters. Ernest followed more leisurely, and still unwilling to wet\r\nhis feet, stood by the margin of the pool and gathered in his\r\nhandkerchief the oysters his brother threw him; as he thus stood he\r\npicked up and pocketed a large mussel shell for his own use. As they\r\nreturned with a good supply we heard a shout from Fritz in the distance;\r\nwe returned it joyfully, and he presently appeared before us, his hands\r\nbehind his back, and a look of disappointment upon his countenance.\r\n\r\n"Unsuccessful!" said he.\r\n\r\n"Really!" I replied; "never mind, my boy, better luck next time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Fritz!" exclaimed his brothers, who had looked behind him, "a\r\nsucking-pig, a little sucking-pig. Where did you get it? How did you\r\nshoot it? Do let us see it!"\r\n\r\nFritz then with sparkling eyes exhibited his prize.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see the results of your prowess, my boy," said I; "but I\r\ncannot approve of deceit, even as a joke; stick to the truth in jest and\r\nearnest."\r\n\r\nFritz then told us how he had been to the other side of the stream. "So\r\ndifferent from this," he said; "it is really a beautiful country, and\r\nthe shore, which runs down to the sea in a gentle slope, is covered with\r\nall sorts of useful things from the wreck. Do let us go and collect\r\nthem. And, father, why should we not return to the wreck and bring off\r\nsome of the animals? Just think of what value the cow would be to us,\r\nand what a pity it would be to lose her! Let us get her on shore, and we\r\nwill move over the stream, where she will have good pasturage, and we\r\nshall be in the shade instead of on this desert, and father, I do\r\nwish----"\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, my boy!" cried I. "All will be done in good time. To-morrow\r\nand the day after will bring work of their own. And tell me, did you see\r\nno traces of our shipmates?"\r\n\r\n"Not a sign of them, either on land or sea, living or dead," he replied.\r\n\r\n"But the sucking-pig," said Jack, "where did you get it?"\r\n\r\n"It was one of several," said Fritz, "which I found on the shore; most\r\ncurious animals they are; they hopped rather than walked, and every now\r\nand then would squat down on their legs and rub their snouts with their\r\nfore-paws. Had not I been afraid of losing them all, I would have tried\r\nto catch one alive, they seemed so tame."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ernest had been carefully examining the animal in question.\r\n\r\n"This is no pig," he said; "and except for its bristly skin, does not\r\nlook like one. See, its teeth are not like those of a pig, but rather\r\nthose of a squirrel. In fact," he continued, looking at Fritz, "your\r\nsucking-pig is an agouti."\r\n\r\n"Dear me," said Fritz; "listen to the great professor lecturing! He is\r\ngoing to prove that a pig is not a pig!"\r\n\r\n"You need not be so quick to laugh at your brother," said I, in my turn;\r\n"he is quite right. I, too, know the agouti by descriptions and\r\npictures, and there is little doubt that this is a specimen. The little\r\nanimal is a native of North America, where it makes its nest under the\r\nroots of trees, and lives upon fruit. But, Ernest, the agouti not only\r\nlooks something like a pig, but most decidedly grunts like a porker."\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus talking, Jack had been vainly endeavoring to open an\r\noyster with his large knife. "Here is a simpler way," said I, placing\r\nan oyster on the fire; it immediately opened. "Now," I continued, "who\r\nwill try this delicacy?" All at first hesitated to partake of them, so\r\nunattractive did they appear. Jack, however, tightly closing his eyes\r\nand making a face as though about to take medicine, gulped one down. We\r\nfollowed his example, one after the other, each doing so rather to\r\nprovide himself with a spoon than with any hope of cultivating a taste\r\nfor oysters.\r\n\r\nOur spoons were now ready, and gathering round the pot we dipped them\r\nin, not, however, without sundry scalded fingers. Ernest then drew from\r\nhis pocket the large shell he had procured for his own use, and scooping\r\nup a good quantity of soup he put it down to cool, smiling at his own\r\nforesight.\r\n\r\n"Prudence should be exercised for others," I remarked; "your cool soup\r\nwill do capitally for the dogs, my boy; take it to them, and then come\r\nand eat like the rest of us."\r\n\r\nErnest winced at this, but silently taking up his shell he placed it on\r\nthe ground before the hungry dogs, who lapped up its contents in a\r\nmoment; he then returned, and we all went merrily on with our dinner.\r\nWhile we were thus busily employed, we suddenly discovered that our\r\ndogs, not satisfied with their mouthful of soup, had espied the agouti,\r\nand were rapidly devouring it. Fritz, seizing his gun, flew to rescue it\r\nfrom their hungry jaws, and before I could prevent him, struck one of\r\nthem with such force that his gun was bent. The poor beasts ran off\r\nhowling, followed by a shower of stones from Fritz, who shouted and\r\nyelled at them so fiercely that his mother was actually terrified. I\r\nfollowed him, and as soon as he would listen to me, represented to him\r\nhow despicable, as well as wicked, was such an outbreak, of temper:\r\n"for," said I, "you have hurt, if not actually wounded, the dogs; you\r\nhave distressed and terrified your mother, and spoiled your gun."\r\n\r\nThough Fritz\'s passion was easily aroused, it never lasted long, and\r\nspeedily recovering himself, immediately he entreated his mother\'s\r\npardon, and expressed his sorrow for his fault.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sun was sinking beneath the horizon, and the poultry,\r\nwhich had been straying to some little distance, gathered round us, and\r\nbegan to pick up the crumbs of biscuit which had fallen during our\r\nrepast. My wife hereupon drew from her mysterious bag some handfuls of\r\noats, peas, and other grain, and with them began to feed the poultry.\r\nShe at the same time showed me several other seeds of various\r\nvegetables. "That was indeed thoughtful," said I; "but pray be careful\r\nof what will be of such value to us; we can bring plenty of damaged\r\nbiscuits from the wreck, which, though of no use as food for us, will\r\nsuit the fowls very well indeed."\r\n\r\nThe pigeons now flew up to crevices in the rocks, the fowls perched\r\nthemselves on our tent pole, and the ducks and geese waddled off,\r\ncackling and quacking, to the marshy margin of the river. We, too, were\r\nready for repose, and having loaded our guns, and offered up our prayers\r\nto God, thanking Him for His many mercies to us, we commended ourselves\r\nto His protecting care, and as the last ray of light departed, closed\r\nour tent and lay down to rest.\r\n\r\nThe children remarked the suddenness of nightfall, for indeed there had\r\nbeen little or no twilight. This convinced me that we must be not far\r\nfrom the equator, for twilight results from the refraction of the sun\'s\r\nrays: the more obliquely these rays fall, the farther does the partial\r\nlight extend; while the more perpendicularly they strike the earth, the\r\nlonger do they continue their undiminished force, until, when the sun\r\nsinks, they totally disappear, thus producing sudden darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n A morning consultation--Breakfast--Away on an expedition--Over the\r\n     stream and through the grass--An unexpected reinforcement--Search\r\n     in vain for our comrades--Rest by a stream--Fritz finds a "round\r\n     bird\'s nest"--Natural history of a cocoanut--Calabash trees--The\r\n     use of gourds--How to make a bottle--A lovely but lonely\r\n     scene--Sugar-canes--Monkeys of use--Cocoanut milk turned to\r\n     champagne--Turk kills an unfortunate mother monkey--Carry the\r\n     orphan home--Display our treasures--A sumptuous supper--Ernest\'s\r\n     penguin--Champagne turned to vinegar--A fight with jackals--A\r\n     curious sentinel--A visit to the wreck--We rig our craft--Stow a\r\n     cargo--Sleep on board--Floats for our herd--We embark--Encounter a\r\n     shark--Land--Relate our adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should have been badly off without the shelter of our tent, for the\r\nnight proved as cold as the day had been hot, but we managed to sleep\r\ncomfortably, every one being thoroughly fatigued by the labors of the\r\nday. The voice of our vigilant cock, which, as he loudly saluted the\r\nrising moon, was the last sound I heard at night, roused me at daybreak,\r\nand I then awoke my wife, that in the quiet interval while yet our\r\nchildren slept, we might take counsel together on our situation and\r\nprospects. It was plain to both of us that, in the first place, we\r\nshould ascertain if possible the fate of our late companions, and then\r\nexamine into the nature and resources of the country on which we were\r\nstranded.\r\n\r\nWe therefore came to the resolution that, as soon as we had breakfasted,\r\nFritz and I should start on an expedition with these objects in view,\r\nwhile my wife remained near our landing-place with the three younger\r\nboys.\r\n\r\n"Rouse up, rouse up, my boys," cried I, awakening the children\r\ncheerfully. "Come and help your mother to get breakfast ready."\r\n\r\n"As to that," said she smiling, "we can but set on the pot, and boil\r\nsome more soup!"\r\n\r\n"Why, you forget Jack\'s fine lobster!" replied I. "What has become of\r\nit, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"It has been safe in this hole in the rock all night, father. You see, I\r\nthought, as the dogs seem to like good things, they might take a fancy\r\nto that, as well as to the agouti."\r\n\r\n"A very sensible precaution," remarked I. "I believe even my heedless\r\nJack will learn wisdom in time. It is well the lobster is so large, for\r\nwe shall want to take part with us on our excursion to-day."\r\n\r\nAt the mention of an excursion, the four children were wild with\r\ndelight, and capering around me, clapped their hands for joy.\r\n\r\n"Steady there, steady!" said I, "you cannot expect all to go. Such an\r\nexpedition as this would be too dangerous and fatiguing for you younger\r\nones. Fritz and I will go alone this time, with one of the dogs, leaving\r\nthe other to defend you."\r\n\r\nWe then armed ourselves, each taking a gun and a game bag; Fritz in\r\naddition sticking a pair of pistols in his belt, and I a small hatchet\r\nin mine; breakfast being over, we stowed away the remainder of the\r\nlobster and some biscuits, with a flask of water, and were ready for a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" I exclaimed, "we have still left something very important\r\nundone."\r\n\r\n"Surely not," said Fritz.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I, "we have not yet joined in morning prayer. We are only\r\ntoo ready, amid the cares and pleasures of this life, to forget the God\r\nto whom we owe all things." Then having commended ourselves to his\r\nprotecting care, I took leave of my wife and children, and bidding them\r\nnot wander far from the boat and tent, we parted not without some\r\nanxiety on either side, for we knew not what might assail us in this\r\nunknown region.\r\n\r\nWe now found that the banks of the stream were on both sides so rocky\r\nthat we could get down to the stream by only one narrow passage, and\r\nthere was no corresponding path on the other side. I was glad to see\r\nthis, however, for I now knew that my wife and children were on a\r\ncomparatively inaccessible spot, the other side of the tent being\r\nprotected by steep and precipitous cliffs. Fritz and I pursued our way\r\nup the stream until we reached a point where the waters fell from a\r\nconsiderable height in a cascade, and where several large rocks lay half\r\ncovered by the water; by means of these we succeeded in crossing the\r\nstream in safety. We thus had the sea on our left, and a long line of\r\nrocky heights, here and there adorned with clumps of trees, stretching\r\naway inland to the right. We had forced our way scarcely fifty yards\r\nthrough the long rank grass, which was here partly withered by the sun\r\nand much tangled, when we heard behind us a rustling, and on looking\r\nround saw the grass waving to and fro, as if some animal were passing\r\nthrough it. Fritz instantly turned and brought his gun to his shoulder,\r\nready to fire the moment the beast should appear. I was much pleased\r\nwith my son\'s coolness and presence of mind, for it showed me that I\r\nmight thoroughly rely upon him on any future occasion when real danger\r\nmight occur; this time, however, no savage beast rushed out, but our\r\ntrusty dog Turk, whom in our anxiety at parting we had forgotten, and\r\nwho had been sent after us, doubtless, by my thoughtful wife.\r\n\r\nFrom this little incident, however, we saw how dangerous was our\r\nposition, and how difficult escape would be should any fierce beast\r\nsteal upon us unawares: we therefore hastened to make our way to the\r\nopen seashore. Here the scene which presented itself was indeed\r\ndelightful. A background of hills, the green waving grass, the pleasant\r\ngroups of trees stretching here and there to the very water\'s edge,\r\nformed a lovely prospect. On the smooth sand we searched carefully for\r\nany trace of our hapless companions, but not the mark of a footstep\r\ncould we find.\r\n\r\n"Shall I fire a shot or two?" said Fritz; "that would bring our\r\ncompanions, if they are within hearing."\r\n\r\n"It would indeed," I said, "or any savages that may be here. No, no; let\r\nus search diligently, but as quietly as possible."\r\n\r\n"But why, father, should we trouble ourselves about them at all? They\r\nleft us to shift for ourselves, and I for one don\'t care to set eyes on\r\nthem again."\r\n\r\n"You are wrong, my boy," said I. "In the first place, we should not\r\nreturn evil for evil; then, again, they might be of great assistance to\r\nus in building a house of some sort; and lastly, you must remember that\r\nthey took nothing with them from the vessel, and may be perishing of\r\nhunger."\r\n\r\nThus talking, we pushed on until we came to a pleasant grove which\r\nstretched down to the water\'s edge; here we halted to rest, seating\r\nourselves under a large tree, by a rivulet which murmured and splashed\r\nalong its pebbly bed into the great ocean before us. A thousand\r\ngayly-plumaged birds flew twittering above us, and Fritz and I gazed up\r\nat them.\r\n\r\nMy son suddenly started up.\r\n\r\n"A monkey," he exclaimed; "I am nearly sure I saw a monkey."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he sprang round to the other side of the tree, and in doing\r\nso stumbled over a round substance, which he handed to me, remarking, as\r\nhe did so, that it was a round bird\'s nest, of which he had often heard.\r\n\r\n"You may have done so," said I, laughing, "but you need not necessarily\r\nconclude that every round hairy thing is a bird\'s nest; this, for\r\ninstance, is not one, but a cocoanut."\r\n\r\nWe split open the nut, but, to our disgust, found the kernel dry and\r\nuneatable.\r\n\r\n"Hullo," cried Fritz, "I always thought a cocoanut was full of delicious\r\nsweet liquid, like almond milk."\r\n\r\n"So it is," I replied, "when young and fresh, but as it ripens the milk\r\nbecomes congealed, and in course of time is solidified into a kernel.\r\nThis kernel then dries as you see here, but when the nut falls on\r\nfavorable soil, the germ within the kernel swells until it bursts\r\nthrough the shell, and, taking root, springs up a new tree."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand," said Fritz, "how the little germ manages to get\r\nthrough this great thick shell, which is not like an almond or hazel\r\nnutshell, that is divided down the middle already."\r\n\r\n"Nature provides for all things," I answered, taking up the pieces.\r\n"Look here, do you see these three round holes near the stalk? it is\r\nthrough them that the germ obtains egress. Now let us find a good nut if\r\nwe can."\r\n\r\nAs cocoanuts must be over-ripe before they fall naturally from the tree,\r\nit was not without difficulty that we obtained one in which the kernel\r\nwas not dried up. When we succeeded, however, we were so refreshed by\r\nthe fruit that we could defer the repast we called our dinner until\r\nlater in the day, and so spare our stock of provisions.\r\n\r\nContinuing our way through a thicket, and which was so densely overgrown\r\nwith lianas that we had to clear a passage with our hatchets, we again\r\nemerged on the seashore beyond, and found an open view, the forest\r\nsweeping inland, while on the space before us stood at intervals single\r\ntrees of remarkable appearance.\r\n\r\nThese at once attracted Fritz\'s observant eye, and he pointed, to them,\r\nexclaiming,\r\n\r\n"Oh, what absurd-looking trees, father! See what strange bumps there are\r\non the trunks."\r\n\r\nWe approached to examine them, and I recognized them as calabash trees,\r\nthe fruit of which grows in this curious way on the stems, and is a\r\nspecies of gourd, from the hard rind of which bowls, spoons, and bottles\r\ncan be made. "The savages," I remarked, "are said to form these things\r\nmost ingeniously, using them to contain liquids: indeed, they actually\r\ncook food in them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but that is impossible," returned Fritz. "I am quite sure this\r\nrind would be burnt through directly it was set on the fire."\r\n\r\n"I did not say it was set on the fire at all. When the gourd has been\r\ndivided in two, and the shell or rind emptied of its contents, it was\r\nfilled with water, into which the fish, or whatever is to be cooked, is\r\nput; red hot stones are added until the water boils; the food becomes\r\nfit to eat, and the gourd-rind remains uninjured."\r\n\r\n"That is a very clever plan: very simple too. I daresay I should have\r\nhit on it, if I had tried," said Fritz.\r\n\r\n"The friends of Columbus thought it very easy to make an egg stand upon\r\nits end when he had shown them how to do it. But now suppose we prepare\r\nsome of these calabashes, that they may be ready for use when we take\r\nthem home."\r\n\r\nFritz instantly took up one of the gourds, and tried to split it equally\r\nwith his knife, but in vain: the blade slipped, and the calabash was cut\r\njaggedly. "What a nuisance!" said Fritz, flinging it down, "the thing is\r\nspoiled; and yet it seemed so simple to divide it properly."\r\n\r\n"Stay," said I; "you are too impatient, those pieces are not useless. Do\r\nyou try to fashion from them a spoon or two while I provide a dish."\r\n\r\nI then took from my pocket a piece of string, which I tied tightly round\r\na gourd, as near one end of it as I could; then tapping the string with\r\nthe back of my knife, it penetrated the outer shell. When this was\r\naccomplished, I tied the string yet tighter; and drawing the ends with\r\nall my might, the gourd fell, divided exactly as I wished.\r\n\r\n"That is clever!" cried Fritz. "What in the world put that plan into\r\nyour head?"\r\n\r\n"It is a plan," I replied, "which the negroes adopt, as I have learned\r\nfrom reading books of travel."\r\n\r\n"Well, it certainly makes a capital soup-tureen, and a soup-plate too,"\r\nsaid Fritz, examining the gourd. "But supposing you had wanted to make a\r\nbottle, how would you have set to work?"\r\n\r\n"It would be an easier operation than this, if possible. All that is\r\nnecessary is to cut a round hole at one end, then to scoop out the\r\ninterior, and to drop in several shot or stones; when these are shaken,\r\nany remaining portions of the fruit are detached, and the gourd is\r\nthoroughly cleaned, and the bottle completed."\r\n\r\n"That would not make a very convenient bottle though, father; it would\r\nbe more like a barrel."\r\n\r\n"True, my boy; if you want a more shapely vessel, you must take it in\r\nhand when it is younger. To give it a neck, for instance, you must tie a\r\nbandage round the young gourd while it is still on the tree, and then\r\nall will swell but that part which you have checked."\r\n\r\nAs I spoke, I filled the gourds with sand, and left them to dry; marking\r\nthe spot that we might return for them on our way back.\r\n\r\nFor three hours or more we pushed forward, keeping a sharp lookout on\r\neither side for any trace of our companions, till we reached a bold\r\npromontory, stretching some way into the sea, from whose rocky summit I\r\nknew that we should obtain a good and comprehensive view of the\r\nsurrounding country. With little difficulty we reached the top, but the\r\nmost careful survey of the beautiful landscape failed to show us the\r\nslightest sign or trace of human beings. Before us stretched a wide and\r\nlovely bay, fringed with yellow sands, either side extending into the\r\ndistance, and almost lost to view in two shadowy promontories; inclosed\r\nby these two arms lay a sheet of rippling water, which reflected in its\r\ndepths the glorious sun above. The scene inland was no less beautiful;\r\nand yet Fritz and I both felt a shade of loneliness stealing over us as\r\nwe gazed on its utter solitude.\r\n\r\n"Cheer up, Fritz, my boy," said I presently. "Remember that we chose a\r\nsettler\'s life long ago, before we left our own dear country; we\r\ncertainly did not expect to be so entirely alone--but what matters a few\r\npeople, more or less? With God\'s help, let us endeavor to live here\r\ncontentedly, thankful that we were not cast upon some bare and\r\ninhospitable island. But come, the heat here is getting unbearable; let\r\nus find some shady place before we are completely broiled away."\r\n\r\nWe descended the hill and made for a clump of palm trees, which we saw\r\nat a little distance. To reach this, we had to pass through a dense\r\nthicket of reeds, no pleasant or easy task; for, besides the difficulty\r\nof forcing our way through, I feared at every step that we might tread\r\non some venomous snake. Sending Turk in advance, I cut one of the reeds,\r\nthinking it would be a more useful weapon against a reptile than my gun.\r\nI had carried it but a little way, when I noticed a thick juice exuding\r\nfrom one end. I tasted it, and to my delight found it sweet and\r\npleasant. I at once knew that I was standing amongst sugar-canes.\r\nWishing Fritz to make the same discovery, I advised him to cut a cane\r\nfor his defense; he did so, and as he beat the ground before him, the\r\nreed split, and his hand was covered with the juice. He carefully\r\ntouched the cane with the tip of his tongue, then, finding the juice\r\nsweet, he did so again with less hesitation; and a moment afterward\r\nsprang back to me exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, sugar-canes! sugar-canes! Taste it. Oh, how delicious, how\r\ndelightful! do let us take a lot home to mother," he continued, sucking\r\neagerly at the cane.\r\n\r\n"Gently there," said I, "take breath a moment, moderation in all things,\r\nremember. Cut some to take home if you like, only don\'t take more than\r\nyou can conveniently carry."\r\n\r\nIn spite of my warning, my son cut a dozen or more of the largest canes,\r\nand stripping them of their leaves, carried them under his arm. We then\r\npushed through the cane-brake, and reached the clump of palms for which\r\nwe had been making; as we entered it a troop of monkeys, who had been\r\ndisporting themselves on the ground, sprang up, chattering and\r\ngrimacing, and before we could clearly distinguish them were at the very\r\ntop of the trees.\r\n\r\nFritz was so provoked by their impertinent gestures that he raised his\r\ngun and would have shot one of the poor beasts.\r\n\r\n"Stay," cried I, "never take the life of any animal needlessly. A live\r\nmonkey up in that tree is of more use to us than a dozen dead ones at\r\nour feet, as I will show you."\r\n\r\nSaying this, I gathered a handful of small stones, and threw them up\r\ntoward the apes. The stones did not go near them, but influenced by\r\ntheir instinctive mania for imitation, they instantly seized all the\r\ncocoanuts within their reach, and sent a perfect hail of them down upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nFritz was delighted with my stratagem, and rushing forward picked up\r\nsome of the finest of the nuts. We drank the milk they contained,\r\ndrawing it through the holes, which I pierced, and then, splitting the\r\nnuts open with the hatchet, ate the cream which lined their shells.\r\nAfter this delicious meal, we thoroughly despised the lobster we had\r\nbeen carrying, and threw it to Turk, who ate it gratefully; but far from\r\nbeing satisfied, the poor beast began to gnaw the ends of the\r\nsugar-canes, and to beg for cocoanut. I slung a couple of the nuts over\r\nmy shoulder, fastening them together by their stalks, and Fritz having\r\nresumed his burden, we began our homeward march.\r\n\r\nI soon discovered that Fritz found the weight of his canes considerably\r\nmore than he expected: he shifted them from shoulder to shoulder, then\r\nfor a while carried them under his arm, and finally stopped short with a\r\nsigh. "I had no idea," he said, "that a few reeds would be so heavy."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, my boy," I said, "patience and courage! Do you not remember\r\nthe story of \xc6sop and his breadbasket, how heavy he found it when he\r\nstarted, and how light at the end of his journey? Let us each take a\r\nfresh staff, and then fasten the bundle crosswise with your gun."\r\n\r\nWe did so, and once more stepped forward. Fritz presently noticed that I\r\nfrom time to time sucked the end of my cane.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come," said he, "that\'s a capital plan of yours, father, I\'ll do\r\nthat too."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he began to suck most vigorously, but not a drop of the juice\r\ncould he extract. "How is this?" he asked. "How do you get the juice\r\nout, father?"\r\n\r\n"Think a little," I replied, "you are quite as capable as I am of\r\nfinding out the way, even if you do not know the real reason of your\r\nfailure."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course," said he, "it is like trying to suck marrow from a\r\nmarrow-bone, without making a hole at the other end."\r\n\r\n"Quite right," I said, "you form a vacuum in your mouth and the end of\r\nyour tube, and expect the air to force down the liquid from the other\r\nend which it cannot possibly enter."\r\n\r\nFritz was speedily perfect in the accomplishment of sucking sugar-cane,\r\ndiscovering by experience the necessity for a fresh cut at each joint or\r\nknot in the cane, through which the juice would not flow; he talked of\r\nthe pleasure of initiating his brothers in the art, and of how Ernest\r\nwould enjoy the cocoanut milk, with which he had filled his flask.\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," said I, "you need not have added that to your load; the\r\nchances are it is vinegar by the time we get home. In the heat of the\r\nsun, it will ferment soon after being drawn from the nut."\r\n\r\n"Vinegar! Oh, that would be a horrid bore! I must look directly, and see\r\nhow it is getting on," cried Fritz, hastily swinging the flask from his\r\nshoulder, and tugging out the cork. With a loud "pop" the contents came\r\nforth, foaming like champagne.\r\n\r\n"There now!" said I, laughing as he tasted this new luxury, "you will\r\nhave to exercise moderation again, friend Fritz! I daresay it is\r\ndelicious, but it will go to your head, if you venture deep into your\r\nflask."\r\n\r\n"My dear father, you cannot think how good it is! Do take some. Vinegar,\r\nindeed! This is like excellent wine."\r\n\r\nWe were both invigorated by this unexpected draught, and went on so\r\nmerrily after it, that the distance to the place where we had left our\r\ngourd-dishes seemed less than we expected. We found them quite dry, and\r\nvery light and easy to carry.\r\n\r\nJust as we had passed through the grove in which we had breakfasted,\r\nTurk suddenly darted away from us and sprang furiously among a troop of\r\nmonkeys, which were gamboling playfully on the turf at a little distance\r\nfrom the trees. They were taken by surprise completely, and the dog, now\r\nreally ravenous from hunger, had seized and was fiercely tearing one to\r\npieces before we could approach the spot.\r\n\r\nHis luckless victim was the mother of a tiny little monkey, which, being\r\non her back when the dog flew at her, hindered her flight. The little\r\ncreature attempted to hide among the grass, and in trembling fear\r\nwatched its mother. On perceiving Turk\'s bloodthirsty design, Fritz had\r\neagerly rushed to the rescue, flinging away all he was carrying, and\r\nlosing his hat in his haste. All to no purpose as far as the poor mother\r\nape was concerned, and a laughable scene ensued, for no sooner did the\r\nyoung monkey catch sight of him, than at one bound it was on his\r\nshoulders, and, holding fast by his thick curly hair, it firmly kept its\r\nseat in spite of all he could do to dislodge it. He screamed and plunged\r\nabout as he endeavored to shake or pull the creature off, but all in\r\nvain; it only clung the closer to his neck, making the most absurd\r\ngrimaces.\r\n\r\nI laughed so much at this ridiculous scene, that I could scarcely assist\r\nmy terrified boy out of his awkward predicament.\r\n\r\nAt last, by coaxing the monkey, offering it a bit of biscuit; and\r\ngradually disentangling its small sinewy paws from the curls it grasped\r\nso tightly, I managed to relieve poor Fritz, who then looked with\r\ninterest at the baby ape, no bigger than a kitten, as it lay in my arms.\r\n\r\n"What a jolly little fellow it is!" exclaimed he, "do let me try to rear\r\nit, father. I daresay cocoanut milk would do until we can bring the cow\r\nand the goats from the wreck. If he lives he might be useful to us. I\r\nbelieve monkeys instinctively know what fruits are wholesome and what\r\nare poisonous."\r\n\r\n"Well," said I, "let the little orphan be yours. You bravely and kindly\r\nexerted yourself to save the mother\'s life; now you must train her child\r\ncarefully, for unless you do so its natural instinct will prove\r\nmischievous instead of useful to us."\r\n\r\nTurk was meanwhile devouring with great satisfaction the little animal\'s\r\nunfortunate mother. I could not grudge it him, and continued hunger\r\nmight have made him dangerous to ourselves. We did not think it\r\nnecessary to wait until he had dined, so we prepared to resume our\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe tiny ape seated itself in the coolest way imaginable on Fritz\'s\r\nshoulder, I helped to carry his canes, and we were on some distance\r\nbefore Turk overtook us, looking uncommonly well pleased, and licking\r\nhis chops as though recalling the memory of his feast.\r\n\r\nHe took no notice of the monkey, but it was very uneasy at sight of him,\r\nand scrambled down into Fritz\'s arms, which was so inconvenient to him\r\nthat he devised a plan to relieve himself of his burden. Calling Turk,\r\nand seriously enjoining obedience, he seated the monkey on his back,\r\nsecuring it there with a cord, and then putting a second string round\r\nthe dog\'s neck that he might lead him, he put a loop of the knot into\r\nthe comical rider\'s hand, saying gravely: "Having slain the parent, Mr.\r\nTurk, you will please to carry the son."\r\n\r\nAt first this arrangement mightily displeased them both, but by and by\r\nthey yielded to it quietly; the monkey especially amused by riding along\r\nwith the air of a person perfectly at his ease.\r\n\r\n"We look just like a couple of mountebanks on their way to a fair with\r\nanimals to exhibit," said I. "What an outcry the children will make when\r\nwe appear!"\r\n\r\nMy son inquired to what species of the monkey tribe I thought his\r\n_prot\xe9g\xe9_ belonged, which led to a good deal of talk on the subject, and\r\nconversation beguiling the way, we found ourselves ere long on the\r\nrocky margin of the stream and close to the rest of our party.\r\n\r\nJuno was the first to be aware of our approach, and gave notice of it by\r\nloud barking, to which Turk replied with such hearty good will, that his\r\nlittle rider, terrified at the noise his steed was making, slipped from\r\nunder the cord and fled to his refuge on Fritz\'s shoulder, where he\r\nregained his composure and settled himself comfortably.\r\n\r\nTurk, who by this time knew where he was, finding himself free dashed\r\nforward to rejoin his friends, and announce our coming.\r\n\r\nOne after another our dear ones came running to the opposite bank,\r\ntestifying in various ways their delight at our return, and hastening up\r\non their side of the river, as we on ours, to the ford at which we had\r\ncrossed in the morning. We were quickly on the other side, and, full of\r\njoy and affection, our happy party was once more united.\r\n\r\nThe boys suddenly perceiving the little animal which was clinging close\r\nto their brother, in alarm at the tumult of voices, shouted in ecstasy:\r\n\r\n"A monkey! a monkey! oh, how splendid! Where did Fritz find him? What\r\nmay we give him to eat? Oh, what a bundle of sticks! Look at those\r\ncurious, great nuts father has got!"\r\n\r\nWe could neither check this confused torrent of questions, nor get in a\r\nword in answer to them.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the excitement subsided a little, I was able to say a\r\nfew words with a chance of being listened to. "I am truly thankful to\r\nsee you all safe and well, and, thank God, our expedition has been very\r\nsatisfactory, except that we have entirely failed to discover any trace\r\nof our shipmates."\r\n\r\n"If it be the will of God," said my wife, "to leave us alone on this\r\nsolitary place, let us be content; and rejoice that we are all together\r\nin safety."\r\n\r\n"Now we want to hear all your adventures, and let us relieve you of\r\nyour burdens," added she, taking my game bag.\r\n\r\nJack shouldered my gun, Ernest took the cocoanuts, and little Franz\r\ncarried the gourds; Fritz distributed the sugar-canes amongst his\r\nbrothers, and handing Ernest his gun replaced the monkey on Turk\'s back.\r\nErnest soon found the burden with which Fritz had laden him too heavy\r\nfor his taste. His mother perceiving this, offered to relieve him of\r\npart of the load. He gave up willingly the cocoanuts, but no sooner had\r\nhe done so than his elder brother exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Ernest, you surely do not know what you are parting with; did\r\nyou really intend to hand over those good cocoanuts without so much as\r\ntasting them?"\r\n\r\n"What? ho! are they really cocoanuts?" cried Ernest. "Do let me take\r\nthem again, mother, do let me look at them."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," replied my wife with a smile. "I have no wish to see\r\nyou again overburdened."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I have only to throw away these sticks, which are of no use,\r\nand then I can easily carry them."\r\n\r\n"Worse and worse," said Fritz; "I have a particular regard for those\r\nheavy, useless sticks. Did you ever hear of sugar-canes?"\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth when Ernest began to suck\r\nvigorously at the end of the cane, with no better result, however, than\r\nFritz had obtained as we were on the march.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Fritz, "let me show you the trick of it," and he speedily\r\nset all the youngsters to work extracting the luscious juice.\r\n\r\nMy wife, as a prudent housekeeper, was no less delighted than the\r\nchildren with this discovery; the sight of the dishes also pleased her\r\ngreatly, for she longed to see us eat once more like civilized beings.\r\nWe went into the kitchen and there found preparations for a truly\r\nsumptuous meal. Two forked sticks were planted in the ground on either\r\nside of the fire; on these rested a rod from which hung several\r\ntempting looking fish; opposite them hung a goose from a similar\r\ncontrivance, slowly roasting while the gravy dropped into a large shell\r\nplaced beneath it. In the center sat the great pot, from which issued\r\nthe smell of a most delicious soup. To crown this splendid array, stood\r\nan open hogshead full of Dutch cheeses. All this was very pleasant to\r\ntwo hungry travelers, but I was about to beg my wife to spare the\r\npoultry until our stock should have increased, when she, perceiving my\r\nthought, quickly relieved my anxiety. "This is not one of our geese,"\r\nshe said, "but a wild bird Ernest killed."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ernest, "it is a penguin, I think; it let me get quite\r\nclose, so that I knocked it on the head with a stick. Here are its head\r\nand feet, which I preserved to show you; the bill is, you see, narrow\r\nand curved downward, and the feet are webbed. It had funny little bits\r\nof useless wings, and its eyes looked so solemnly and sedately at me\r\nthat I was almost ashamed to kill it. Do you not think it must have been\r\na penguin?"\r\n\r\n"I have little doubt on the matter, my boy," and I was about to make a\r\nfew remarks on the habits of this bird, when my wife interrupted me and\r\nbegged us to come to dinner, and continue our natural history\r\nconversation at some future time. We then sat down before the appetizing\r\nmeal prepared for us, our gourds coming for the first time into use, and\r\nhaving done it full justice, produced the cocoanuts by way of dessert.\r\n\r\n"Here is better food for your little friend," said I to Fritz, who had\r\nbeen vainly endeavoring to persuade the monkey to taste dainty morsels\r\nof the food we had been eating; "the poor little animal has been\r\naccustomed to nothing but its mother\'s milk; fetch me a saw, one of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nI then, after extracting the milk of the nuts from their natural holes,\r\ncarefully cut the shells in half, thus providing several more useful\r\nbasins. The monkey was perfectly satisfied with the milk, and eagerly\r\nsucked the corner of a handkerchief dipped in it. Fritz now suddenly\r\nrecollected his delicious wine, and producing his flask, begged his\r\nmother to taste it. "Try it first yourself," said I; Fritz did so, and I\r\ninstantly saw by his countenance that the liquor had passed through the\r\nfirst stage of fermentation and had become vinegar.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, my boy," said my prudent wife, when she learned the cause\r\nof his wry faces, "we have wine already; but no vinegar; I am really\r\npleased at the transformation."\r\n\r\nThe sun was now rapidly sinking behind the horizon, and the poultry,\r\nretiring for the night, warned us that we must follow their example.\r\nHaving offered up our prayers, we lay down on our beds, the monkey\r\ncrouched down between Jack and Fritz, and we were all soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWe did not, however, long enjoy this repose; a loud barking from our\r\ndogs, who were on guard outside the tent, awakened us, and the\r\nfluttering and cackling of our poultry warned us that a foe was\r\napproaching. Fritz and I sprang up, and seizing our guns rushed out.\r\nThere we found a desperate combat going on; our gallant dogs, surrounded\r\nby a dozen or more large jackals, were fighting bravely. Four of their\r\nopponents lay dead, but the others were in no way deterred by the fate\r\nof their comrades. Fritz and I, however, sent bullets through the heads\r\nof a couple more, and the rest galloped off. Turk and Juno did not\r\nintend that they should escape so cheaply, and pursuing them, they\r\ncaught, killed, and devoured another of the animals, regardless of their\r\nnear relationship. Fritz wished to save one of the jackals that he might\r\nbe able to show it to his brothers in the morning; dragging, therefore,\r\nthe one that he had shot near the tent, he concealed it, and we once\r\nmore returned to our beds.\r\n\r\nSoundly and peacefully we slept until cock-crow next morning, when my\r\nwife and I awoke, and began to discuss the business of the day.\r\n\r\n"It seems absolutely necessary, my dear wife," I began "to return at\r\nonce to the wreck while it is yet calm, that we may save the poor\r\nanimals left there, and bring on shore many articles of infinite value\r\nto us, which, if we do not now recover, we may finally lose entirely. On\r\nthe other hand, I feel that there is an immense deal to be done on\r\nshore, and that I ought not to leave you in such an insecure shelter as\r\nthis tent."\r\n\r\n"Return to the wreck by all means," replied my wife, cheerfully.\r\n"Patience, order, and perseverance will help us through all our work,\r\nand I agree with you that a visit to the wreck is without doubt our\r\nfirst duty. Come, let us wake the children, and set to work without\r\ndelay."\r\n\r\nThey were soon roused, and Fritz, overcoming his drowsiness before the\r\nothers, ran out for his jackal; it was cold and stiff from the night\r\nair, and he placed it on its legs before the tent, in a most life-like\r\nattitude, and stood by to watch the effect upon the family. The dogs\r\nwere the first to perceive their enemy, and growling, seemed inclined to\r\ndispose of the animal as they had disposed of its brethren in the night,\r\nbut Fritz called them off. The noise the dogs made, however, had the\r\neffect of bringing out the younger children, and many were the\r\nexclamations they made at the sight of the strange animal.\r\n\r\n"A yellow dog!" cried Franz.\r\n\r\n"A wolf!" exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n"It is a striped fox," said Ernest.\r\n\r\n"Hullo," said Fritz. "The greatest men may make mistakes. Our Professor\r\ndoes not know a jackal when he sees one."\r\n\r\n"But really," continued Ernest, examining the animal, "I think it is a\r\nfox."\r\n\r\n"Very well, very well," retorted Fritz, "no doubt you know better than\r\nyour father! He thinks it is a jackal."\r\n\r\n"Come, boys," said I, "no more of this quarreling; you are none of you\r\nvery far wrong, for the jackal partakes of the nature of all three, dog,\r\nwolf, and fox."\r\n\r\nThe monkey had come out on Jack\'s shoulder, but no sooner did it catch\r\nsight of the jackal, than it fled precipitately back into the tent, and\r\nhid itself in a heap of moss until nothing was visible but the tip of\r\nits little nose. Jack soothed and comforted the frightened little\r\nanimal, and I then summoned them all to prayers, soon after which we\r\nbegan our breakfast. So severely had we dealt with our supper the\r\nprevious night that we had little to eat but the biscuits, which were so\r\ndry and hard, that, hungry as we were, we could not swallow much. Fritz\r\nand I took some cheese to help them down, while my wife and younger sons\r\nsoaked theirs in water. Ernest roamed down to the shore, and looked\r\nabout for shell-fish. Presently he returned with a few whelks. "Ah,"\r\nsaid he, "if we had but some butter." "My boy," I replied, "your\r\nperpetual IF, IF, quite annoys me; why do you not sit down and eat\r\ncheese like the rest of us." "Not while I can get butter," he said; "see\r\nhere, father," and he pointed to a large cask, "that barrel contains\r\nbutter of some sort or another, for it is oozing out at the end."\r\n\r\n"Really, Ernest," I said, "we are indebted to you. I will open the\r\ncask." So saying, I took a knife and carefully cut a small hole, so that\r\nI could extract the butter without exposing the mass of it to the\r\neffects of the air and heat. Filling a cocoanut shell, we once more sat\r\ndown, and toasting our biscuits before the fire, spread them with the\r\ngood Dutch butter. We found this vastly better than the dry biscuits,\r\nand while we were thus employed I noticed that the two dogs were lying\r\nunusually quiet by my side. I at first attributed this drowsiness to\r\ntheir large meal during the night, but I soon discovered that it arose\r\nfrom a different cause; the faithful animals had not escaped unhurt from\r\ntheir late combat, but had received several deep and painful wounds,\r\nespecially about the neck. The dogs began to lick each other on the\r\nplaces which they could not reach with their own tongues, and my wife\r\ncarefully dressed the wounds with butter, from which she had extracted\r\nthe salt by washing.\r\n\r\nA sudden thought now struck Ernest, and he wisely remarked, that if we\r\nwere to make spiked collars for the dogs, they would in future escape\r\nsuch dangerous wounds. "Oh, yes," exclaimed Jack, "and I will make them;\r\nmay I not, father?"\r\n\r\n"Try, by all means, my little fellow," said I, "and persuade your mother\r\nto assist you; and now, Fritz," I continued, "we must be starting, for\r\nyou and I are to make a trip to the wreck." I begged the party who were\r\nto remain on shore to keep together as much as possible, and having\r\narranged a set of signals with my wife, that we might exchange\r\ncommunications, asked a blessing on our enterprise. I erected a signal\r\npost, and, while Fritz was making preparations for our departure,\r\nhoisted a strip of sailcloth as a flag; this flag was to remain hoisted\r\nso long as all was well on shore, but should our return be desired,\r\nthree shots were to be fired and the flag lowered.\r\n\r\nAll was now ready, and warning my wife that we might find it necessary\r\nto remain all night on the vessel, we tenderly bade adieu and embarked.\r\nExcept our guns and ammunition, we were taking nothing, that we might\r\nleave as much space as possible for the stowage of a large cargo. Fritz,\r\nhowever, had resolved to bring his little monkey, that he might obtain\r\nmilk for it as soon as possible. We had not got far from the shore, when\r\nI perceived that a current from the river set in directly for the\r\nvessel, and though my nautical knowledge was not great, I succeeded in\r\nsteering the boat into the favorable stream, which carried us nearly\r\nthree-fourths of our passage with little or no trouble to ourselves;\r\nthen, by dint of hard pulling, we accomplished the whole distance, and\r\nentering through the breach, gladly made fast our boat and stepped on\r\nboard. Our first care was to see the animals, who greeted us with\r\njoy--lowing, bellowing, and bleating as we approached; not that the poor\r\nbeasts were hungry, for they were all still well supplied with food, but\r\nthey were apparently pleased by the mere sight of human beings. Fritz\r\nthen placed his monkey by one of the goats, and the little animal\r\nimmediately sucked the milk with evident relish, chattering and grinning\r\nall the while; the monkey provided for, we refreshed ourselves with\r\nsome wine and biscuits. "Now," said I, "we have plenty to do; where\r\nshall we begin?"\r\n\r\n"Let us fix a mast and sail to our boat," answered Fritz; "for the\r\ncurrent which brought us out will not take us back, whereas the fresh\r\nbreeze we met would help us immensely had we but a sail."\r\n\r\n"Capital thought," I replied; "let us set to work at once."\r\n\r\nI chose a stout spar to serve as a mast, and having made a hole in a\r\nplank nailed across one of the tubs, we, with the help of a rope and a\r\ncouple of blocks, stepped it and secured it with stays. We then\r\ndiscovered a lugsail, which had belonged to one of the ships\' boats;\r\nthis we hoisted; and our craft was ready to sail. Fritz begged me to\r\ndecorate the masthead with a red streamer, to give our vessel a more\r\nfinished appearance. Smiling at this childish but natural vanity, I\r\ncomplied with his request. I then contrived a rudder, that I might be\r\nable to steer the boat; for though I knew that an oar would serve the\r\npurpose, it was cumbrous and inconvenient. While I was thus employed,\r\nFritz examined the shore with his glass, and soon announced that the\r\nflag was flying and all was well.\r\n\r\nSo much time had now slipped away that we found we could not return that\r\nnight, as I had wished. We signaled our intention of remaining on board,\r\nand then spent the rest of our time in taking out the stones we had\r\nplaced in the boat for ballast, and stowed in their place heavy articles\r\nof value to us. The ship had sailed for the purpose of supplying a young\r\ncolony, she had therefore on board every conceivable article we could\r\ndesire in our present situation; our only difficulty, indeed, was to\r\nmake a wise selection. A large quantity of powder and shot we first\r\nsecured, and as Fritz considered that we could not have too many\r\nweapons, we added three excellent guns, and a whole armful of swords,\r\ndaggers, and knives. We remembered that knives and forks were\r\nnecessary, we therefore laid in a large stock of them, and kitchen\r\nutensils of all sorts. Exploring the captain\'s cabin, we discovered a\r\nservice of silver plate and a cellaret of good old wine; we then went\r\nover the stores, and supplied ourselves with potted meats, portable\r\nsoups, Westphalian hams, sausages, a bag of maize and wheat, and a\r\nquantity of other seeds and vegetables. I then added a barrel of sulphur\r\nfor matches, and as much cordage as I could find. All this--with nails,\r\ntools, and agricultural implements--completed our cargo, and sank our\r\nboat so low that I should have been obliged to lighten her had not the\r\nsea been calm.\r\n\r\nNight drew on, and a large fire, lighted by those on shore, showed us\r\nthat all was well. We replied by hoisting four ship\'s lanterns, and two\r\nshots announced to us that our signal was perceived; then, with a\r\nheartfelt prayer for the safety of our dear ones on shore, we retired to\r\nour boat, and Fritz, at all events, was soon sound asleep. For a while I\r\ncould not sleep; the thought of my wife and children--alone and\r\nunprotected, save by the great dogs--disturbed my rest.\r\n\r\nThe night at length passed away. At daybreak Fritz and I arose and went\r\non deck. I brought the telescope to bear upon the shore, and with\r\npleasure saw the flag still waving in the morning breeze; while I kept\r\nthe glass directed to the land, I saw the door of the tent open, and my\r\nwife appear and look steadfastly toward us.\r\n\r\nI at once hoisted a white flag, and in reply the flag on shore was\r\nthrice dipped. Oh, what a weight seemed lifted from my heart as I saw\r\nthe signal!\r\n\r\n"Fritz," I said, "I am not now in such haste to get back, and begin to\r\nfeel compassion for all these poor beasts. I wish we could devise some\r\nmeans for getting them on shore."\r\n\r\n"We might make a raft," suggested Fritz, "and take off one or two at a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"True," I replied; "it is easy enough to say, \'make a raft,\' but to do\r\nit is quite another thing."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fritz, "I can think of nothing else, unless indeed we make\r\nthem such swimming belts as you made for the children."\r\n\r\n"Really, my boy, that idea is worth having. I am not joking, indeed," I\r\ncontinued, as I saw him smile; "we may get every one of the animals\r\nashore in that way."\r\n\r\nSo saying, I caught a fine sheep, and proceeded to put our plan into\r\nexecution. I first fastened a broad piece of linen round its belly, and\r\nto this attached some corks and empty tins; then, with Fritz\'s help, I\r\nflung the animal into the sea--it sank, but a moment afterward rose and\r\nfloated famously.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" exclaimed Fritz, "we will treat them all like that." We then\r\nrapidly caught the other animals and provided them, one after the other,\r\nwith a similar contrivance. The cow and ass gave us more trouble than\r\ndid the others, as for them we required something more buoyant than the\r\nmere cork; we at last found some empty casks and fastened two to each\r\nanimal by thongs passed under its belly. This done, the whole herd were\r\nready to start, and we brought the ass to one of the ports to be the\r\nfirst to be launched. After some maneuvering we got him in a convenient\r\nposition, and then a sudden heave sent him plunging into the sea. He\r\nsank, and then, buoyed up by the casks, emerged head and back from the\r\nwater. The cow, sheep, and goats followed him one after the other, and\r\nthen the sow alone remained. She seemed, however, determined not to\r\nleave the ship; she kicked, struggled, and squealed so violently, that I\r\nreally thought we should be obliged to abandon her; at length, after\r\nmuch trouble, we succeeded in sending her out of the port after the\r\nothers, and when once in the water, such was the old lady\'s energy that\r\nshe quickly distanced them, and was the first to reach the shore.\r\n\r\nWe had fastened to the horns or neck of each animal a cord with a float\r\nattached to the end, and now embarking, we gathered up these floats, set\r\nsail, and steered for shore, drawing our herd after us.\r\n\r\nDelighted with the successful accomplishment of our task, we got out\r\nsome biscuits and enjoyed a midday meal; then, while Fritz amused\r\nhimself with his monkey, I took up my glass and tried to make out how\r\nour dear ones on shore were employing themselves. As I was thus engaged,\r\na sudden shout from Fritz surprised me. I glanced up; there stood Fritz\r\nwith his gun to his shoulder, pointing it at a huge shark; the monster\r\nwas making for one of the finest sheep; he turned on his side to seize\r\nhis prey; as the white of his belly appeared Fritz fired. The shot took\r\neffect, and our enemy disappeared, leaving a trace of blood on the calm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"Well done, my boy," I cried, "you will become a crack shot one of these\r\ndays; but I trust you will not often have such dangerous game to shoot."\r\nFritz\'s eyes sparkled at his success and my praise, and reloading his\r\ngun carefully watched the water. But the shark did not again appear,\r\nand, borne onward by the breeze, we quickly neared the shore. Steering\r\nthe boat to a convenient landing place, I cast off the ropes which\r\nsecured the animals, and let them get ashore as best they might.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of my wife or children when we stepped on land, but a\r\nfew moments afterward they appeared, and with a shout of joy ran toward\r\nus. We were thankful to be once more united, and after asking and\r\nreplying to a few preliminary questions, proceeded to release our herd\r\nfrom their swimming belts, which, though so useful in the water, were\r\nexceedingly inconvenient on shore. My wife was astonished at the\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n"How clever you are!" said she.\r\n\r\n"I am not the inventor," I replied; "the honor is due to Fritz. He not\r\nonly thought of this plan for bringing off the animals, but saved one,\r\nat least, of them from a most fearful death." And I then told them how\r\nbravely he had encountered the shark.\r\n\r\nMy wife was delighted with her son\'s success, but declared that she\r\nwould dread our trips to the vessel more than ever, knowing that such\r\nsavage fish inhabited the waters.\r\n\r\nFritz, Ernest, and I began the work of unloading our craft, while Jack,\r\nseeing that the poor donkey was still encumbered with his swimming belt,\r\ntried to free him from it. But the donkey would not stand quiet, and the\r\nchild\'s fingers were not strong enough to loosen the cordage; finally,\r\ntherefore, he scrambled upon the animal\'s back, and urging him on with\r\nhand and foot, trotted toward us.\r\n\r\n"Come, my boy," I said, "no one must be idle here, even for a moment;\r\nyou will have riding practice enough hereafter; dismount and come and\r\nhelp us."\r\n\r\nJack was soon on his feet. "But I have not been idle all day," he said;\r\n"look here!" and he pointed to a belt round his waist. It was a broad\r\nbelt of yellow hair, in which he had stuck a couple of pistols and a\r\nknife. "And see," he added, "what I have made for the dogs. Here, Juno!\r\nTurk!" the dogs came bounding up at his call, and I saw that they were\r\neach supplied with a collar of the same skin, in which were fastened\r\nnails, which bristled round their necks in a most formidable manner.\r\n\r\n"Capital, capital! my boy," said I, "but where did you get your\r\nmaterials, and who helped you?"\r\n\r\n"Except in cutting the skin," said my wife, "he had no assistance, and\r\nas for the materials, Fritz\'s jackal supplied us with the skin, and the\r\nneedles and thread came out of my wonderful bag. You little think how\r\nmany useful things may be had from that same bag; it is woman\'s duty and\r\nnature, you know, to see after trifles."\r\n\r\nFritz evidently did not approve of the use to which his jackal\'s hide\r\nhad been devoted, and holding his nose, begged his little brother to\r\nkeep at a distance. "Really, Jack," he said, "you should have cured the\r\nhide before you used it; the smell is disgusting; don\'t come near me."\r\n\r\n"It is not the hide that smells at all," retorted Jack, "it is your\r\nnasty jackal itself, that you left in the sun."\r\n\r\n"Now, boys," said I, "no quarreling here; do you, Jack, help your\r\nbrother to drag the carcass to the sea, and if your belt smells after\r\nthat you must take it off and dry it better."\r\n\r\nThe jackal was dragged off, and we then finished our work of unloading\r\nour boat. When this was accomplished we started for our tent, and\r\nfinding no preparation for supper, I said, "Fritz, let us have a\r\nWestphalian ham."\r\n\r\n"Ernest," said my wife, smiling, "let us see if we cannot conjure up\r\nsome eggs."\r\n\r\nFritz got out a splendid ham and carried it to his mother triumphantly,\r\nwhile Ernest set before me a dozen white balls with parchment-like\r\ncoverings.\r\n\r\n"Turtles\' eggs!" said I. "Well done, Ernest! where did you get them?"\r\n\r\n"That," replied my wife, "shall be told in due course when we relate our\r\nadventures; now we will see what they will do toward making a supper for\r\nyou; with these and your ham I do not think we shall starve."\r\n\r\nLeaving my wife to prepare supper, we returned to the shore and brought\r\nup what of the cargo we had left there; then, having collected our herd\r\nof animals, we returned to the tent.\r\n\r\nThe meal which awaited us was as unlike the first supper we had there\r\nenjoyed as possible. My wife had improvised a table of a board laid on\r\ntwo casks; on this was spread a white damask tablecloth, on which were\r\nplaced knives, forks, spoons, and plates for each person. A tureen of\r\ngood soup first appeared, followed by a capital omelette, then slices of\r\nthe ham; and finally some Dutch cheese, butter, and biscuits, with a\r\nbottle of the captain\'s Canary wine, completed the repast.\r\n\r\nWhile we thus regaled ourselves, I related to my wife our adventures,\r\nand then begged she would remember her promise and tell me all that had\r\nhappened in my absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n The mother relates her adventures--Proposes that we should build a\r\n     nest--How Jack treated the jackal skin--How the boys were\r\n     surprised by a bustard--How they found the mangrove tree--How the\r\n     dogs caught the crabs--We discuss the possibility of making a\r\n     house in the tree--To bed once more--We start for the wreck--The\r\n     shark again--Return to land--Franz\'s crawfish--Bridge\r\n     building--We pack up--A family removing in patriarchal style--A\r\n     prickly enemy--Jack shoots it--We reach our new home--Fritz rids\r\n     our poultry of an enemy--Little Franz finds the figs--Dinner--We\r\n     prepare materials for our nest--Flamingoes--Roast and tame--The\r\n     use of trigonometry--A cord carried over the bough--The rope\r\n     ladder made--We mount our tree--Sleep under the roots--The\r\n     building of the nest--Retire to roost for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I will spare you a description," said my wife, "of our first day\'s\r\noccupations; truth to tell, I spent the time chiefly in anxious thought\r\nand watching your progress and signals. I rose very early this morning,\r\nand with the utmost joy perceiving your signal that all was right,\r\nhastened to reply to it, and then, while my sons yet slumbered, I sat\r\ndown and began to consider how our position could be improved. \'For it\r\nis perfectly impossible,\' said I to myself, \'to live much longer where\r\nwe are now. The sun beats burningly the lifelong day on this bare, rocky\r\nspot, our only shelter is this poor tent, beneath the canvas of which\r\nthe heat is even more oppressive than on the open shore. Why should not\r\nI and my little boys exert ourselves as well as my husband and Fritz?\r\nWhy should not we too try to accomplish something useful? If we could\r\nbut exchange this melancholy and unwholesome abode for a pleasant, shady\r\ndwelling place, we should all improve in health and spirits. Among those\r\ndelightful woods and groves where Fritz and his father saw so many\r\ncharming things, I feel sure there must be some little retreat where we\r\ncould establish ourselves comfortably; there must be, and I will find\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n"By this time the boys were up, and I observed Jack very quietly and\r\nbusily occupied with his knife about the spot where Fritz\'s jackal lay.\r\nWatching his proceedings, I saw that he had cut two long, narrow strips\r\nof the animal\'s skin, which he cleaned and scraped very carefully, and\r\nthen taking a handful of great nails out of his pocket, he stuck them\r\nthrough the skin, points outward, after which he cut strips of canvas\r\nsailcloth, twice as broad as the thongs, doubled them, and laid them on\r\nthe raw side of the skin, so as to cover the broad, flat nail heads. At\r\nthis point of the performance, Master Jack came to me with the agreeable\r\nrequest that I would kindly stitch the canvas and (moist) skin together\r\nfor him. I gave him needles and thread, but could not think of depriving\r\nhim of the pleasure of doing it himself.\r\n\r\n"However, when I saw how good-humoredly he persevered in the work with\r\nhis awkward, unskilled fingers, I took pity on him, and conquering the\r\ndisgust I felt, finished lining the skin dog-collars he had so\r\ningeniously contrived. After this, I was called upon to complete in the\r\nsame way a fine belt of skin he had made for himself. I advised him to\r\nthink of some means by which the skin might be kept from shrinking.\r\n\r\n"Ernest, although rather treating Jack\'s manufacture with ridicule,\r\nproposed a sensible enough plan, which Jack forthwith put into\r\nexecution. He nailed the skin, stretched flat, on a board, and put it in\r\nthe sun to dry.\r\n\r\n"My scheme of a journey was agreed to joyously by my young companions.\r\nPreparations were instantly set on foot; weapons and provisions\r\nprovided; the two elder boys carrying guns, while they gave me charge of\r\nthe water flask, and a small hatchet.\r\n\r\n"Leaving everything in as good order as we could at the tent, we\r\nproceeded toward the stream, accompanied by the dogs. Turk, who had\r\naccompanied you on your first expedition, seemed immediately to\r\nunderstand that we wished to pursue the same route, and proudly led the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"As I looked at my two young sons, each with his gun, and considered how\r\nmuch the safety of the party depended on these little fellows, I felt\r\ngrateful to you, dear husband, for having acquainted them in childhood\r\nwith the use of firearms.\r\n\r\n"Filling our water-jar, we crossed the stream, and went on to the\r\nheight, from whence, as you described, a lovely prospect is obtained, at\r\nthe sight of which a pleasurable sensation of buoyant hope, to which I\r\nhad long been a stranger, awoke within my breast.\r\n\r\n"A pretty little wood in the distance attracted my notice particularly,\r\nand thither we directed our course. But soon finding it impossible to\r\nforce our way through the tall, strong grass, which grew in dense\r\nluxuriance higher than the children\'s heads, we turned toward the open\r\nbeach on our left, and following it, we reached a point much nearer the\r\nlittle woods, when, quitting the strand, we made toward it.\r\n\r\n"We had not entirely escaped the tall grass, however, and with the\r\nutmost fatigue and difficulty, were struggling through the reeds, when\r\nsuddenly a great rushing noise terrified us all dreadfully. A very large\r\nand powerful bird sprang upward on the wing. Both boys attempted to take\r\naim, but the bird was far away before they were ready to fire.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, dear, what a pity!\' exclaimed Ernest; \'now if I had only had my\r\nlight gun, and if the bird had not flown quite so fast, I should have\r\nbrought him down directly!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh yes,\' said I, \'no doubt you would be a capital sportsman, if only\r\nyour game would always give you time to make ready comfortably.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But I had no notion that anything was going to fly up just at our feet\r\nlike that,\' cried he.\r\n\r\n"\'A good shot,\' I replied, \'must be prepared for surprises; neither\r\nwild birds nor wild beasts will send you notice that they are about to\r\nfly or to run.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What sort of bird can it have been?\' inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, it certainly must have been an eagle,\' answered little Franz, \'it\r\nwas so very big!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Just as if every big bird must be an eagle!\' replied Ernest, in a tone\r\nof derision.\r\n\r\n"\'Let\'s see where he was sitting, at all events!\' said I.\r\n\r\n"Jack sprang toward the place, and instantly a second bird, rather\r\nlarger than the first, rushed upward into the air, with a most startling\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n"The boys stood staring upward, perfectly stupefied, while I laughed\r\nheartily, saying, \'Well, you are first-rate sportsmen, to be sure! You\r\ncertainly will keep my larder famously well supplied!\'\r\n\r\n"At this, Ernest colored up, and looked inclined to cry, while Jack put\r\non a comical face, pulled off his cap, and with a low bow, called after\r\nthe fugitive:\r\n\r\n"\'Adieu for the present, sir! I live in hopes of another meeting!\'\r\n\r\n"On searching the ground carefully, we discovered a rude sort of nest\r\nmade untidily of dry grass. It was empty, although we perceived broken\r\negg shells at no great distance, and concluded that the young brood had\r\nescaped among the grass, which, in fact, we could see was waving at a\r\nlittle distance, as the little birds ran through it.\r\n\r\n"\'Now look here, Franz,\' said Ernest, presently, \'just consider how this\r\nbird could by any possibility have been an eagle. Eagles never build on\r\nthe ground, neither can their young leave the nest and run as soon as\r\nthey are out of the egg. That is a peculiarity of the gallinaceous tribe\r\nof birds alone, to which then these must belong. The species, I think,\r\nis indicated by the white belly and dull red color of the wing coverts\r\nwhich I observed in these specimens, and I believe them to be bustards,\r\nespecially as I noticed in the largest the fine mustache-like feathers\r\nover the beak, peculiar to the great bustard.\'\r\n\r\n"\'My dear boy!\' I said, \'your eyes were actively employed, I must\r\nconfess, if your fingers were unready with the gun. And after all, it is\r\njust as well, perhaps, that we have not thrown the bustard\'s family into\r\nmourning.\'\r\n\r\n"Thus chatting, we at length approached my pretty wood. Numbers of birds\r\nfluttered and sang among the high branches, but I did not encourage the\r\nboys in their wish to try to shoot any of the happy little creatures. We\r\nwere lost in admiration of the trees in this grove, and I cannot\r\ndescribe to you how wonderful they are, nor can you form the least idea\r\nof their enormous size without seeing them yourself. What we had been\r\ncalling a wood proved to be a group of about a dozen trees only, and,\r\nwhat was strange, the roots sustained the massive trunks exalted in the\r\nair, forming strong arches, and props and stays all around each\r\nindividual stem, which was firmly rooted in the center.\r\n\r\n"I gave Jack some twine, and scrambling up one of the curious open-air\r\nroots, he succeeded in measuring round the trunk itself, and made it out\r\nto be about eighteen yards. I saw no sort of fruit, but the foliage is\r\nthick and abundant, throwing delicious shade on the ground beneath,\r\nwhich is carpeted with soft green herbage, and entirely free from\r\nthorns, briars, or bushes of any kind. It is the most charming resting\r\nplace that ever was seen, and I and the boys enjoyed our midday meal\r\nimmensely in this glorious palace of the woods, so grateful to our\r\nsenses after the glare and heat of our journey thither. The dogs joined\r\nus after a while. They had lingered behind on the seashore, and I was\r\nsurprised to see them lie down and go comfortably to sleep without\r\nbegging for food, as they do usually when we eat.\r\n\r\n"The longer we remained in this enchanting place, the more did it charm\r\nmy fancy; and if we could but manage to live in some sort of dwelling up\r\namong the branches of those grand, noble trees, I should feel perfectly\r\nsafe and happy. It seemed to me absurd to suppose we should ever find\r\nanother place half so lovely, so I determined to search no further, but\r\nreturn to the beach and see if anything from the wreck had been cast up\r\nby the waves, which we could carry away with us.\r\n\r\n"Before starting, Jack persuaded me to sit quietly a little longer, and\r\nfinish making his belt and the spike-collars for the dogs, for you must\r\nknow that the child had actually been carrying the board on which these\r\nwere stretched all this time, so that they should get the full benefit\r\nof the sun. As they were now quite dry, I completed them easily, and\r\nJack girded on the belt with great pride, placing his pistols in it, and\r\nmarching about in the most self-important style, while Ernest fitted the\r\ncollars on the two dogs.\r\n\r\n"On reaching the shore, we found it strewed with many articles,\r\ndoubtless of value, but all too heavy for us to lift. We rolled some\r\ncasks, however, beyond high-water mark, and dragged a chest or two also\r\nhigher on the beach; and, while doing so, observed that our dogs were\r\nbusy among the rocks. They were carefully watching the crevices and\r\npools, and every now and then would pounce downward and seize something\r\nwhich they swallowed with apparent relish.\r\n\r\n"\'They are eating crabs,\' said Jack. \'No wonder they have not seemed\r\nhungry lately.\'\r\n\r\n"And, sure enough, they were catching the little green crabs with which\r\nthe water abounded. These, however, did not apparently entirely satisfy\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Some time afterward, just as we were about to turn inland toward the\r\nford, we noticed that Juno was scraping in the sand, and turning up some\r\nround substances, which she hastily devoured. Ernest went to see what\r\nthese were, and reported in his calm way that the dog had found turtles\'\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh,\' cried I, \'then let us by all means share in the booty!\' Mrs.\r\nJuno, however, did not at all approve of this, and it was with some\r\ndifficulty that we drove her aside while we gathered a couple of dozen\r\nof eggs, stowing them in our provision bags.\r\n\r\n"While thus employed, we caught sight of a sail which appeared to be\r\nmerrily approaching the shore beyond the cliffs. Ernest declared it must\r\nbe our raft. Little Franz, always having the fear of savages before his\r\neyes, began to look frightened, and for a moment I myself was doubtful\r\nwhat to think.\r\n\r\n"However, we hastened to the stream; and crossing it by the\r\nstepping-stones, came in sight of the landing place, where we joyfully\r\nmet you.\r\n\r\n"Now I hope you approve of the proceedings of your exploring party, and\r\nthat to-morrow you will do me the favor of packing everything up, and\r\ntaking us away to live among my splendid trees."\r\n\r\n"Aye, little wife," said I; "so that is your idea of comfort and\r\nsecurity, is it? A tree, I do not know how many feet high, on which we\r\nare to perch and roost like the birds? If we had but wings or a balloon,\r\nit would, I own, be a capital plan."\r\n\r\n"Laugh as much as you like," returned my wife, "my idea is not so absurd\r\nas you make it out. We should be safe up there from jackals\' visits\r\nduring the night. And I know I have seen at home, in Switzerland, quite\r\na pretty arbor, with a strong floor, up among the branches of a lime\r\ntree, and we went up a staircase to reach it. Why could not we contrive\r\na place like that, where we could sleep safely at night?"\r\n\r\n"I will consider the idea seriously, my wife," said I; "perhaps\r\nsomething may come of it, after all! Meantime, as we have finished our\r\nsupper, and night is coming on, let us commend ourselves to Almighty\r\nprotection and retire to rest."\r\n\r\nBeneath the shelter of our tent, we all slept soundly, like marmots,\r\nuntil break of day; when, my wife and I awaking, we took counsel\r\ntogether as to future proceedings.\r\n\r\nReferring to the task she had the previous evening proposed for me, I\r\nremarked that to undertake it would involve so many difficulties that\r\nit was highly necessary to look closely into the subject.\r\n\r\n"In the first place," said I, "I am unwilling hastily to quit a spot to\r\nwhich I am convinced we were providentially led as a landing place. See\r\nhow secure it is; guarded on all sides by these high cliffs, and\r\naccessible only by the narrow passage to the ford, while from this point\r\nit is so easy to reach the ship that the whole of the valuable cargo is\r\nat our disposal. Suppose we decide to stay patiently here for the\r\npresent--until, at least, we have brought on shore everything we\r\npossibly can?"\r\n\r\n"I agree with you to a certain extent, dear husband," replied she; "but\r\nyou do not know how dreadfully the heat among the rocks tries me. It is\r\nalmost intolerable to us who remain here all day, while you and Fritz\r\nare away out at sea or wandering among the shady woods, where cool\r\nfruits refresh, and fair scenes delight you. As to the contents of the\r\nship, an immense deal has been cast ashore, and I would much rather give\r\nup all the remainder, and be spared the painful anxiety it gives me when\r\nyou even talk of venturing again on the faithless deep."\r\n\r\n"Well, I must admit that there is much right on your side," I continued;\r\n"suppose we were to remove to your chosen abode, and make this rocky\r\nfastness our magazine and place of retreat in case of danger. I could\r\neasily render it more secure, by blasting portions of the rock with\r\ngunpowder. But a bridge must be constructed in the first place, to\r\nenable us to cross bag and baggage."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall be parched to death before we can leave this place if a\r\nbridge has to be made," cried my wife impatiently. "Why not just take\r\nour things on our backs and wade across as we have done already? The cow\r\nand the donkey could carry a great deal."\r\n\r\n"That they will have to do, in whatever fashion we make the move," said\r\nI; "but bags and baskets we must have, to put things in, and if you will\r\nturn your attention to providing those, I will set about the bridge at\r\nonce. It will be wanted not once but continually; the stream will\r\nprobably swell and be impassable at times, and even as it is, an\r\naccident might happen."\r\n\r\n"Well! well!" cried my wife, "I submit to your opinion; only pray set\r\nabout it without delay, for I long to be off. It is an excellent idea to\r\nmake a strong place among the cliffs here; the gunpowder especially, I\r\nshall be delighted to see stored here when we go away, for it is\r\nfrightfully dangerous to keep so much as we have close to our\r\nhabitation."\r\n\r\n"Gunpowder is indeed the most dangerous and at the same time the most\r\nuseful thing we have," said I, "and for both these reasons we must be\r\nespecially careful of it. In time I will hollow out a place in the rock\r\nwhere we can store it safe from either fire or damp."\r\n\r\nBy this morning\'s consultation we had settled the weighty question of\r\nour change of abode, and also chalked out work for the day.\r\n\r\nWhen the children heard of the proposed move their joy was boundless;\r\nthey began at once to talk of it as our "journey to the Promised Land,"\r\nand only regretted that time must be "wasted," as they said, in\r\nbridge-building before it could be undertaken.\r\n\r\nEvery one being impatient for breakfast that work might be begun at\r\nonce, the cow and goats were milked, and, having enjoyed a comfortable\r\nmeal of biscuit boiled in milk, I prepared to start for the wreck, in\r\norder to obtain planks for the proposed bridge. Ernest, as well as\r\nFritz, accompanied me, and we were soon within the influence of the\r\ncurrent, and were carried swiftly out to sea. Fritz was steering, and we\r\nhad no sooner passed beyond the islet at the entrance of the bay, so as\r\nto come in sight of its seaward beach, than we were astonished to see a\r\ncountless multitude of sea birds, gulls, and others, which rose like a\r\ncloud into the air, disturbed by our approach, and deafened us by their\r\nwild and screaming cries. Fritz caught up his gun, and would have sent a\r\nshot among them had I permitted it. I was curious to find out what could\r\nbe the attraction for all this swarm of feathered fowl; and, availing\r\nmyself of a fresh breeze from the sea, I set the sail and directed our\r\ncourse toward the island.\r\n\r\nThe swelling sail and flying pennant charmed Ernest, while Fritz bent\r\nhis keen eyes eagerly toward the sandy shore, where the flocks of birds\r\nwere again settling.\r\n\r\nPresently he shouted: "Aha! now I see what they are after! They have got\r\na huge monster of a fish there and a proper feast they are making! Let\'s\r\nhave a nearer look at it, father!"\r\n\r\nWe could not take our boat very close in, but we managed to effect a\r\nlanding at a short distance from the festive scene; and, securing the\r\nraft by casting a rope round a large stone, we cautiously drew near the\r\nobject of interest.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a monstrous fish on whose flesh these multitudes of\r\nbirds were ravenously feeding; and it was extraordinary to watch the\r\nferocity, the envy, the gluttony, and all manner of evil passions,\r\nexhibited among the guests at this banquet.\r\n\r\n"There was nothing on this sandy beach when we passed yesterday, I am\r\ncertain, father," said Fritz. "It seems strange to see this creature\r\nstranded here."\r\n\r\n"Why, Fritz!" cried Ernest, "it must be the shark! your shark, you know!\r\nI believe I can see where you hit him in the head."\r\n\r\n"You are right, I do believe, Ernest," said I, "though I think your\r\nimagination only can distinguish the gunshot wound among all the pecking\r\nand tearing of the voracious birds there. Just look, boys, at those\r\nterrific jaws, beneath the strangely projecting snout. See the rows upon\r\nrows of murderous teeth, and thank God we were delivered from them! Let\r\nus try if we can induce these greedy birds to spare us a bit of the\r\nshark\'s skin; it is extremely rough, and when dry may be used like a\r\nfile."\r\n\r\nErnest drew the ramrod from his gun, and charged so manfully into the\r\ncrowd, that striking right and left he speedily killed several, while\r\nmost of the others took to flight. Fritz detached some broad strips of\r\nskin with his knife, and we returned toward the boat.\r\n\r\nPerceiving with satisfaction that the shore was strewn with just the\r\nsort of boards and planks I wanted, I lost no time in collecting them;\r\nand, forming a raft to tow after us, we were in a short time able to\r\ndirect our course homeward, without visiting the wreck at all. As we\r\nsailed along, extremely well pleased with our good fortune, Fritz, by my\r\ndirection, nailed part of the shark\'s skin flat on boards to dry in the\r\nsun, and the rest on the rounded mast.\r\n\r\n"Will that be a good plan, father?" inquired he, "it will be quite bent\r\nand crooked when it hardens."\r\n\r\n"That is just what I want it to be," said I, "we may happen to find it\r\nuseful in that form as well as flat. It would be beautiful shagreen if\r\nwe could smooth and polish it."\r\n\r\n"I thought," remarked Ernest, "that shagreen was made from asses\' hide."\r\n\r\n"And you thought rightly," said I. "The best shagreen is prepared in\r\nTurkey, Persia, and Tartary, from the skins of horses and asses. In\r\nthese skins, the roughness is produced artificially; while the skin is\r\nnewly flayed and still soft, hard grains of corn are spread on the under\r\nsurface, and pressed into it as it dries. These grains are afterward\r\nremoved, and the roughness imparted to the appearance of the skin\r\nremains indelibly; shagreen is useful in polishing joiners\' work, and it\r\nis made in France from the rough skin of a hideous creature called the\r\nangel-fish."\r\n\r\n"Angel-fish!" exclaimed Fritz; "what a name to give to anything\r\n\'hideous,\' father!"\r\n\r\n"There are bad angels as well as good ones," observed Ernest, in his\r\ndry, quiet way; "it is better to leave people to see for themselves\r\nwhich is meant."\r\n\r\nBy this time we were close in shore; and, lowering the sail, we soon\r\nhad our craft, with the raft in tow, safely moored to the bank.\r\n\r\nNo one was in sight, not a sound to be heard, so with united voice we\r\ngave a loud cheery halloo, which after a while was answered in shrill\r\ntones, and the mother, with her two boys, came running from behind the\r\nrocks between us and the stream, each carrying a small bundle in a\r\nhandkerchief, while little Franz held aloft a landing net.\r\n\r\nOur return so soon was quite unexpected, and they anxiously inquired the\r\nreason, which we soon explained; and then the mysterious bundles were\r\nopened, and a great number of fine crawfish displayed; whose efforts to\r\nescape by scuttling away in every direction, directly they were placed\r\nin a heap on the ground, caused immense fun and laughter as the boys\r\npursued and brought them back, only to find others scrambling off in a\r\ndozen different ways.\r\n\r\n"Now, father, have we not done well to-day!" cried Jack, "did you ever\r\nsee such splendid crawfish? Oh, there were thousands of them, and I am\r\nsure we have got two hundred here at least. Just look at their claws!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt you were the discoverer of these fine crabs, eh, Jack?" said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n"No! fancy young Franz being the lucky man!" answered he. "He and I went\r\ntoward the stream while mother was busy, just to look for a good place\r\nfor the bridge. Franz was picking up pebbles and alabasters, some\r\nbecause they were so pretty, some to strike sparks with in the dark, and\r\nsome, he insisted, were \'gold.\' \'Jack! Jack!\' cried he presently, \'come\r\nand see the crabs on Fritz\'s jackal!\' You know we threw it away there,\r\nand to be sure it was swarming with these creatures. Are you glad we\r\nhave found them, father? Will they be good to eat?"\r\n\r\n"Very excellent, my boy, and we may be thankful that food for our wants\r\nis thus provided day by day."\r\n\r\nWhen each party had related the day\'s adventures, and while the mother\r\nwas cooking the crawfish, we went to bring our store of planks to land.\r\nEven this apparently simple operation required thought, and I had to\r\nimprovise rope-harness for the cow and the donkey, by which we could\r\nmake them drag each board separately from the water\'s edge to the margin\r\nof the stream.\r\n\r\nJack showed me where he thought the bridge should be, and I certainly\r\nsaw no better place, as the banks were at that point tolerably close to\r\none another, steep, and of about equal height.\r\n\r\n"How shall we find out if our planks are long enough to reach across?"\r\nsaid I. "A surveyor\'s table would be useful now."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to a ball of string, father?" said Ernest. "Tie one end\r\nto a stone, throw it across, then draw it back and measure the line!"\r\n\r\nAdopting my son\'s idea, we speedily ascertained the distance across to\r\nbe eighteen feet. Then allowing three feet more at each side, I\r\ncalculated twenty-four feet as the necessary length of the boards.\r\n\r\nThe question as to how the planks were to be laid across was a difficult\r\none. We resolved to discuss it during dinner, to which we were now\r\nsummoned. And my wife, as we sat resting, displayed to me her\r\nneedlework. With hard labor she had made two large canvas bags for the\r\nass to carry. Having no suitable needle, she had been obliged to bore\r\nthe hole for each stitch with a nail, and gained great praise for her\r\ningenuity and patience. Dinner was quickly dispatched, as we were all\r\neager to continue our engineering work. A scheme had occurred to me for\r\nconveying one end of a plank across the water, and I set about it in\r\nthis way. There fortunately were one or two trees close to the stream on\r\neither side. I attached a rope pretty near one end of a beam, and slung\r\nit loosely to the tree beside us; then, fastening a long rope to the\r\nother end, I crossed with it by means of broken rocks and stones, and\r\nhaving a pulley and block, I soon arranged the rope on a strong limb of\r\nthe opposite tree, again returning with the end to our own side.\r\n\r\nNow putting my idea to the proof, I brought the ass and the cow, and\r\nfastening this rope to the harness I had previously contrived for them,\r\nI drove them steadily away from the bank. To my great satisfaction, and\r\nthe surprise and delight of the boys, the end of the plank which had\r\nbeen laid alongside the stream began gently to move, rose higher,\r\nturned, and soon projecting over the water, continued to advance, until,\r\nhaving described the segment of a circle, it reached the opposite bank;\r\nI stopped my team, the plank rested on the ground, the bridge was made!\r\nSo at least thought Fritz and Jack, who in a moment were lightly running\r\nacross the narrow way, shouting joyfully as they sprang to the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOur way was now comparatively easy. A second and third plank were laid\r\nbeside the first; and when these were carefully secured at each end to\r\nthe ground and to the trees, we very quickly laid short boards side by\r\nside across the beams, the boys nailing them lightly down as I sawed\r\nthem in lengths; and when this was done, our bridge was pronounced\r\ncomplete. Nothing could exceed the excitement of the children. They\r\ndanced to and fro on the wonderful structure, singing, shouting, and\r\ncutting the wildest capers.\r\n\r\nI must confess I heartily sympathized with their triumphant feelings.\r\n\r\nNow that the work was done, we began to feel how much we were fatigued,\r\nand gladly returned to our tent for refreshment and repose.\r\n\r\nNext morning, while we breakfasted, I made a little speech to my sons on\r\nthe subject of the important move we were about to make, wishing to\r\nimpress them with a sense of the absolute necessity of great caution.\r\n\r\n"Remember," said I, "that, although you all begin to feel very much at\r\nyour ease here, we are yet complete strangers to a variety of dangers\r\nwhich may surprise us unawares. I charge you, therefore, to maintain\r\ngood order, and keep together on the march. No darting off into\r\nby-ways, Jack. No lingering behind to philosophize, Ernest. And now all\r\nhands to work."\r\n\r\nThe greatest activity instantly prevailed in our camp. Some collected\r\nprovisions, others packed kitchen utensils, tools, ropes, and hammocks,\r\narranging them as burdens for the cow and ass. My wife pleaded for a\r\nseat on the latter for her little Franz, and assuring me likewise that\r\nshe could not possibly leave the poultry, even for a night, nor exist an\r\nhour without her magic bag, I agreed to do my best to please her,\r\nwithout downright cruelty to the animals.\r\n\r\nAway ran the children to catch the cocks and hens. Great chasing,\r\nfluttering, and cackling ensued; but with no success whatever, until the\r\nmother recalled her panting sons; and scattering some handfuls of grain\r\nwithin the open tent, soon decoyed the fowls and pigeons into the\r\nenclosure; where, when the curtain was dropped, they were easily caught,\r\ntied together, and placed on the cow. This amiable and phlegmatic animal\r\nhad stood calmly chewing the cud, while package after package was\r\ndisposed on her broad back, nor did she now object even to this noisy\r\naddition to her load. I placed a couple of half-hoops over all; and,\r\nspreading sailcloth on them, put the fowls in darkness, and they rapidly\r\nbecame quiet; and the cow, with the appearance of having a small wagon\r\non her back, was ready to start.\r\n\r\nFranz was firmly seated on the ass, amidst bags and bundles of all sorts\r\nand sizes; they rose about him like cushions and pillows, and his curly\r\nhead rested on the precious magic bag, which surmounted all the rest.\r\n\r\nHaving filled the tent with the things we left behind, closing it\r\ncarefully, and ranging chests and casks around it, we were finally ready\r\nto be off, each well equipped and in the highest spirits.\r\n\r\nFritz and his mother led the van.\r\n\r\nFranz (the young cavalier) and the sober-minded cow followed them\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nJack conducted the goats; one of these had also a rider, for Knips,[A]\r\nthe monkey, was seated on his foster-mother, whose patience was sorely\r\ntried by his restlessness and playful tricks.\r\n\r\n[A] German, Knipps, a mannikin.\r\n\r\nThe sheep were under Ernest\'s care, and I brought up the rear of this\r\npatriarchal band, while the dogs kept constantly running backward and\r\nforward in the character of aides-de-camp.\r\n\r\n"We seem delightfully like those simple and pastoral tribes I have read\r\nof," said Ernest, as we proceeded, "whose whole lives are spent in\r\nshifting from place to place, without any wish to settle."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I. "Among the Arabs, Tartars, and some other Eastern\r\nnations, this mode of life is natural. They for that reason are called\r\nNomads.\r\n\r\n"These tribes are amply provided with camels and horses, and effect\r\ntheir journeys more quickly and conveniently than we are likely to do\r\nwith these deliberate quadrupeds of ours. Whatever you young folks may\r\nthink, I suspect your mother and I will be quite satisfied with one such\r\nundertaking. At least I hope she will be contented with the nest she\r\nintends me to build for her up in her wonderful trees."\r\n\r\nWith honest pride I introduced my wife to my bridge, and after receiving\r\nfrom her what I considered well-merited praise for my skill in its\r\nconstruction, we passed over it in grand procession, re-enforced\r\nunexpectedly on the opposite side by the arrival of our cross-grained\r\nold sow. The perverse creature had obstinately resisted our attempts to\r\nbring her with us, but finding herself deserted, had followed of her own\r\naccord, testifying in the most unmistakable manner, by angry grunts and\r\nsqueals, her entire disapproval of our proceedings.\r\n\r\nI soon found we must, as before, turn down to the sea beach, for not\r\nonly did the rank grass impede our progress, but it also tempted the\r\nanimals to break away from us, and, but for our watchful dogs, we might\r\nhave lost several of them.\r\n\r\nOn the firm open sands we were making good way, when, to my annoyance,\r\nboth our dogs suddenly left us, and springing into the thick cover to\r\nour right, commenced a furious barking, following by howling as if in\r\nfear and violent pain.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment doubting that some dangerous animal was at hand, I\r\nhastened to the spot, remarking as I went the characteristic behavior of\r\nmy three sons.\r\n\r\nFritz cocked his gun and advanced boldly, but with caution.\r\n\r\nErnest looked disconcerted, and drew back, but got ready to fire.\r\n\r\nWhile Jack hurried after Fritz without so much as unslinging his gun\r\nfrom his shoulders.\r\n\r\nBefore I could come up with them, I heard Jack shouting excitedly,\r\n\r\n"Father! father! come quickly! a huge porcupine! a most enormous\r\nporcupine!"\r\n\r\nSure enough, the dogs were rushing round and round a porcupine, and\r\nhaving attempted to seize it, were already severely wounded by its\r\nquills. Each time they came near, the creature, with a rattling noise,\r\nbristled up its spines.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to my amusement, while we were looking at the curious defence\r\nthis creature was making, little Jack stepped close up to it, with a\r\npocket pistol in his hand, and shot it dead, making sure of it by a\r\ncouple of heavy raps on the head, and then giving way to a burst of\r\nboyish exultation, he called upon us to help to convey his prize to his\r\nmother. This it was by no means easy to do. Sundry attempts resulted in\r\nbloody fingers, till Jack, taking his pocket handkerchief, and fastening\r\none corner round its neck, ran off, dragging it after him to where his\r\nmother awaited us.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, mother! here\'s a jolly beast, isn\'t it? I shot it, and it\'s good\r\nto eat! Father says so! I only wish you had seen how it terrified the\r\ndogs, and heard the rattling and rustling of its spines. Oh, it is a\r\nfearful creature!"\r\n\r\nErnest, examining it carefully, pronounced its incisor teeth, its ears\r\nand feet, to resemble those of the human race, and pointed out the\r\ncurious crest of stiff hairs on its head and neck.\r\n\r\n"I have read of another species," said he, "called the tuft-tailed\r\nporcupine, which must be even more curious looking than this is. It has\r\nshort, flat quills, and a scaly tail ending in an extraordinary tuft,\r\nlike a bunch of narrow strips of parchment. It cannot be such a\r\ndisagreeable enemy to encounter as this fellow."\r\n\r\n"Were you not afraid, Jack," asked I, "lest the porcupine should cast\r\nsome of his quills like darts at you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not," returned he, "I know well enough that is nothing but a\r\nfable!"\r\n\r\n"A fable!" said I; "why, look at your mother! she is drawing five or six\r\nspines out of each of the dogs!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, those stuck into them when they so fiercely fell upon it in their\r\nattack. Those are the short quills, and seem very slightly fixed in its\r\nskin. The long quills bent aside when Juno pressed against them."\r\n\r\n"You are perfectly right, my boy," said I; "there is no truth in the old\r\nidea of shooting out the spines. But now, shall we leave this prickly\r\nbooty of yours, or attempt to take it with us?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please father, let us take it! Why, it is good to eat!"\r\n\r\nSmiling at the child\'s eagerness, and willing to please him, I made a\r\nsomewhat awkward bundle of the porcupine, wrapping it in several folds\r\nof cloth, and added it to the donkey\'s load.\r\n\r\nOur party then resumed the march, which, with little interruption, was\r\ncontinued steadily, until we came in sight of our future place of\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful appearance of the enormous trees, and the calm beauty of\r\nthe spot altogether, fully came up to the enthusiastic description which\r\nhad been given me. And my wife gladly heard me say that, if an abode\r\ncould be contrived among the branches, it would be the safest and most\r\ncharming home in the world.\r\n\r\nWe hastily unloaded the ass and cow, securing them, as well as the sheep\r\nand goats, by tying their forefeet loosely together. The doves and\r\npoultry were set at liberty, and we sat down to rest among the soft\r\nherbage while we laid our plans for the night.\r\n\r\nFritz soon left us, but presently two shots were fired, and he appeared\r\nholding a fine tiger cat by the hind legs, which, with the intensest\r\ndelight, he exhibited to each in turn.\r\n\r\n"Well done, Fritz!" cried I. "Our cocks and hens would have had an\r\nunfortunate night of it but for this lucky shot of yours. It is to be\r\nhoped he has left no companion near at hand. You must be on the\r\nlookout."\r\n\r\n"How curious it seems," remarked Ernest, "that God should create hurtful\r\nanimals like this."\r\n\r\n"To our feeble and narrow vision many of the ways of the Infinite and\r\nEternal Mind are incomprehensible," I replied. "What our limited reason\r\ncannot grasp, let us be content to acknowledge as the workings of\r\nAlmighty power and wisdom, and thankfully trust in that \'Rock,\' which,\r\nwere it not higher than we, would afford no sense of security to the\r\nimmortal soul. That animals should prey upon one another is a means of\r\npreserving a due balance in the world of nature, and in many ways these\r\nbeasts of prey are also useful to man. What beautiful and warm furs are\r\nprocured by hunters just in those countries where no other covering\r\nwould defend the inhabitants from the wintery cold!--as, for instance,\r\nthe skins of bears, wolverines, and arctic foxes, wild cats, and many\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"The skin of the seal, or sea dog, is also valuable," said Ernest.\r\n\r\n"It is," I replied, "and in its own element that creature preys on fish\r\nas the dog did on land animals before his race become domesticated by\r\nman. But now, Fritz, tell us how you obtained your prize."\r\n\r\n"Observing that something moved among the branches," said he, "I went\r\nsoftly around the tree with my gun, and making sure the creature was a\r\nwild cat, I fired and brought it down. It was severely wounded, but,\r\nrising in a fury, it attempted to climb the tree, when I, luckily having\r\na loaded pistol, gave it a quietus. And do tell me, father, what sort of\r\na cat it is."\r\n\r\n"It is a mercy the brute did not fly at your throat instead of\r\nattempting to escape," said I. "It belongs to a fierce and bloodthirsty\r\nrace--that of the ocelots or tiger cats, natives of the tropical parts\r\nof America. I should say this was a margay, and it would have proved a\r\ncruel foe, not only of our poultry, but also of our sheep and goats. I\r\nam well pleased that you have rid us of it."\r\n\r\n"May I have the beautiful skin, father? And will you tell me what will\r\nbe the best use to make of it?"\r\n\r\n"I advise you to skin the animal very carefully, and of the handsome\r\nblack and yellow tail make a hunting-belt for yourself. The paws--let me\r\nsee--why, I fancy the paws might be made famous cases for knife, fork\r\nand spoon, and look well hanging from the belt. The skin of the body you\r\nhad better preserve until you find some suitable use for it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, what a splendid plan!" cried Jack; "do tell me some good\r\nuse for my porcupine."\r\n\r\n"I think its feet may make cases also; at least, you may try. The\r\nquills, I am sure, may be used for packing needles, and for tipping\r\narrows, and I should try to make defensive armor for the dogs out of the\r\nrest. They may fall in with foes more dangerous than any we have yet\r\nseen."\r\n\r\n"To be sure, father, the very thing!" shouted Jack, in high glee. "I\r\nhave seen pictures of boar hunts, in which the dogs were protected by a\r\nsort of leather coat of mail. That will be grand!"\r\n\r\nAfter giving this advice, I got no peace until I had shown my boys how\r\nto act upon it, and in a short time each had his prize fastened up by\r\nthe hind legs, and carefully slitting the skin, was stripping it from\r\nthe carcass.\r\n\r\nErnest, meanwhile, was fetching large flat stones in order to form a\r\nfireplace, while Franz gathered sticks, as his mother was anxious to\r\nprepare some food.\r\n\r\n"What sort of a tree do you suppose this to be, father?" inquired\r\nErnest, seeing me examining that under which we were encamping. "Is not\r\nthe leaf something like the walnut?"\r\n\r\n"There is a resemblance, but in my opinion these gigantic trees must be\r\nmangroves or wild figs. I have heard their enormous height described,\r\nand also the peculiarity of the arching roots supporting the main trunk\r\nraised above the soil."\r\n\r\nJust then little Franz came up with a large bundle of sticks, and his\r\nmouth full of something he was eating with evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother!" cried he, "this is so good! So delicious!"\r\n\r\n"Greedy little boy!" exclaimed she in a fright. "What have you got\r\nthere? Don\'t swallow it, whatever you do. Very likely it is poisonous!\r\nSpit it all out this minute!" And the anxious mother quickly extracted\r\nfrom the rosy little mouth the remains of a small fig.\r\n\r\n"Where did you find this?" said I.\r\n\r\n"There are thousands lying among the grass yonder," replied the little\r\nboy. "They taste very nice. I thought poison was nasty. Do you think\r\nthey will hurt me? The pigeons and the hens are gobbling them up with\r\nall their might and main, papa!"\r\n\r\n"I think you have no cause for alarm, dear wife," I said. "The trees\r\nseem to be the fig-bearing mangrove of the Antilles. But remember,\r\nFranz, you must never eat anything without first showing it to me, never\r\nmind how good it seems. If birds and monkeys eat a fruit or vegetable,\r\nit is usually safe to believe it wholesome," added I, turning to the\r\nother boys, who, instantly taking the hint, coaxed Franz to give them\r\nthe figs he still had in his pocket, and ran to offer them to Knips, who\r\nwas closely watching the skinning of the tiger cat and porcupine,\r\napparently giving his opinion on the subject with much chattering and\r\ngesticulation.\r\n\r\n"Here, Knips, allow me to present you with a fig!" cried Jack, holding\r\none out to the funny little creature.\r\n\r\nKnips took it readily, and after turning it about, and sniffing and\r\nsmelling it, he popped it into his mouth, with such a droll grimace of\r\ndelight and satisfaction that the boys all laughed and clapped their\r\nhands, crying "Bravo, Knips! you know a good thing when you see it,\r\ndon\'t you, old fellow! Hurrah!"\r\n\r\nMy wife, with her mind set at rest on the question of the figs, now\r\ncontinued her preparations for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the margay was given to the dogs, but part of the porcupine\r\nwas put on the fire to boil, while we reserved the rest for roasting.\r\n\r\nI employed myself in contriving needles for my wife\'s work, by boring\r\nholes at one end of the quills, which I did by means of a red hot nail,\r\nand I soon had a nice packet of various sizes, which pleased her\r\nimmensely. I also laid plans for making proper harness for our beasts of\r\nburden, but could not attempt to begin that while so many wants more\r\npressing demanded attention.\r\n\r\nWe examined the different trees, and chose one which seemed most suited\r\nto our purpose. The branches spread at a great height above us, and I\r\nmade the boys try if it were possible to throw sticks or stones over one\r\nof these, my intention being to construct a rope ladder if we could once\r\nsucceed in getting a string across a strong bough.\r\n\r\nFinding we could not succeed in that way, I resolved other schemes in my\r\nmind, and meantime went with Jack and Fritz to a small brook close by,\r\nwhere I showed them how to place the skins to steep and soften in the\r\nwater, with stones placed on them to keep them beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over, I prepared our night quarters. I first slung our\r\nhammocks from the roots of the tree, which, meeting above us, formed an\r\narched roof, then covering the whole with sailcloth, we made a temporary\r\ntent, which would at least keep off the night damps and noxious insects.\r\n\r\nLeaving my wife engaged in making a set of harness for the ass and cow,\r\nwhose strength I intended to employ the following day in drawing the\r\nbeams up to our tree, I walked down with Fritz and Ernest to the beach\r\nto look for wood suitable for building our new abode, and also to\r\ndiscover, if possible, some light rods to form a ladder. For some time\r\nwe hunted in vain, nothing but rough drift wood was to be seen, utterly\r\nunfit for our purpose. Ernest at length pointed out a quantity of\r\nbamboos, half buried in the sand. These were exactly what I wanted, and\r\nstripping them of their leaves I cut them into lengths of about five\r\nfeet each; these I bound in bundles to carry to the tree, and then began\r\nto look about for some slight reeds to serve as arrows.\r\n\r\nI presently saw what I required in a copse at a little distance. We\r\nadvanced cautiously lest the thicket should contain some wild beast or\r\nvenomous serpent. Juno rushed ahead; as she did so a flock of\r\nflamingoes, which had been quietly feeding, rose in the air. Fritz,\r\ninstantly firing, brought a couple of the birds to the ground, the rest\r\nof the squadron sailing away in perfect order, their plumage continually\r\nchanging, as they flew, from beautiful rose to pure white, as\r\nalternately their snowy wings and rosy breasts were visible. One of\r\nthose which fell was perfectly dead, but the other appeared only\r\nslightly wounded in the wing, for it made off across the swampy ground.\r\nI attempted to follow, but soon found that progress was impossible on\r\nthe marsh; Juno, however, chased the bird and, seizing it, speedily\r\nbrought it to my feet. Fritz and Ernest were delighted at the sight of\r\nour prize.\r\n\r\n"What a handsome bird!" exclaimed they. "Is it much hurt? Let us tame it\r\nand let it run about with the fowls."\r\n\r\n"Its plumage is much more brilliant than that of the dead one," remarked\r\nFritz.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ernest, "this is a full grown bird, while yours is younger;\r\nit is some years before they reach perfection. See what long active legs\r\nit has, like those of a stork, while with its great webbed feet it can\r\nswim faster than a goose. Earth, air, or water is all the same to the\r\nflamingo, it is equally at home in any one of the three."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fritz, "let us take the dead one to mother and get her to\r\nintroduce it to the other element, and see what it will make of that; if\r\nit is young and tender, as you say, it should make a delicious roast."\r\n\r\nFritz and Ernest then carried the birds and bamboos to the trees, while\r\nI proceeded to cut my reeds. I chose those which had flowered, knowing\r\nthat they were harder, and having cut a sufficient quantity of these, I\r\nselected one or two of the tallest canes I could find to assist me in\r\nmeasuring the height of the tree. I then bound them together and\r\nreturned to my family.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to keep this great hungry bird Fritz has brought?" said my\r\nwife, "it is another mouth to feed, remember, and provisions are still\r\nscarce."\r\n\r\n"Luckily," I replied, "the flamingo will not eat grain like our poultry,\r\nbut will be quite satisfied with insects, fish, and little crabs, which\r\nit will pick up for itself. Pray reassure yourself, therefore, and let\r\nme see to the poor bird\'s wound."\r\n\r\nSo saying, I procured some wine and butter and anointed the wing, which\r\nthough hurt was not broken. I bound it up, and then took the bird to the\r\nstream, where I fastened it by a long cord to a stake and left it to\r\nshift for itself. In a few days the wound was healed, and the bird,\r\nsubdued by kind treatment, became rapidly tame.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus employed my sons were endeavoring to ascertain the\r\nheight of the lowest branch of the tree from the ground. They had\r\nfastened together the long reeds I had brought, and were trying to\r\nmeasure the distance with them, but in vain; they soon found that were\r\nthe rods ten times their length they could not touch the branch.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, my boys," I said, when I discovered what they were about, "that\r\nis not the way to set to work. Geometry will simplify the operation\r\nconsiderably; with its help the altitude of the highest mountains are\r\nascertained. We may, therefore, easily find the height of the branch."\r\n\r\nSo saying, I measured out a certain distance from the base of the tree\r\nand marked the spot, and then by means of a rod whose length I knew, and\r\nimaginary lines, I calculated the angle subtended by the trunk of the\r\ntree from the ground to the root of the branch. This done, I was able to\r\ndiscover the height required, and, to the astonishment of the younger\r\nchildren, announced that we should henceforth live thirty feet above the\r\nground. This I wanted to know, that I might construct a ladder of the\r\nnecessary length.\r\n\r\nTelling Fritz to collect all our cord, and the others to roll all the\r\ntwine into a ball, I sat down, and taking the reeds, speedily\r\nmanufactured half a dozen arrows and feathered them from the dead\r\nflamingo. I then took a strong bamboo, bent it, and strung it so as to\r\nform a bow. When the boys saw what I had done they were delighted, and\r\nbegged to have the pleasure of firing the first shot.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" said I, "I did not make this for mere pleasure, nor is it even\r\nintended as a weapon, the arrows are pointless. Elizabeth," I continued\r\nto my wife, "can you supply me with a ball of stout thread from your\r\nwonderful bag?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," replied she, "I think a ball of thread was the first thing\r\nto enter the bag," and diving her hand deep in, she drew out the very\r\nthing I wanted.\r\n\r\n"Now, boys," I said, "I am going to fire the first shot," and I fastened\r\none end of the thread to one of my arrows and aimed at a large branch\r\nabove me. The arrow flew upward and bore the thread over the branch and\r\nfell at our feet. Thus was the first step in our undertaking\r\naccomplished. Now for the rope ladder!\r\n\r\nFritz had obtained two coils of cord, each about forty feet in length;\r\nthese we stretched on the ground side by side; then Fritz cut the\r\nbamboos into pieces of two feet for the steps of the ladder, and as he\r\nhanded them to me, I passed them through knots which I had prepared in\r\nthe ropes, while Jack fixed each end with a nail driven through the\r\nwood. When the ladder was finished, I carried over the bough a rope by\r\nwhich it might be hauled up. This done, I fixed the lower end of the\r\nladder firmly to the ground by means of stakes, and was all ready for an\r\nascent. The boys, who had been watching me with intense interest, were\r\neach eager to be first.\r\n\r\n"Jack shall have the honor," said I, "as he is the lightest; so up with\r\nyou, my boy, and do not break your neck."\r\n\r\nJack, who was as active as a monkey, sprang up the ladder and quickly\r\ngained the top.\r\n\r\n"Three cheers for the nest!" he exclaimed, waving his cap. "Hurrah,\r\nhurrah, hurrah for our jolly nest! What a grand house we will have up\r\nhere; come along, Fritz!"\r\n\r\nHis brother was soon by his side, and with a hammer and nails secured\r\nthe ladder yet more securely. I followed with an ax, and took a survey\r\nof the tree. It was admirably suited to our purpose; the branches were\r\nvery strong and so closely interwoven that no beams would be required to\r\nform a flooring, but when some of the boughs were lopped and cleared\r\naway, a few planks would be quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nI now called for a pulley, which my wife fastened to the cord hanging\r\nbeside the ladder. I hauled it up, and finding the boys rather in my\r\nway, told them to go down, while I proceeded to fasten the pulley to a\r\nstout branch above me, that we might be able to haul up the beams we\r\nshould require the next day. I then made other preparations, that there\r\nmight be no delay on the morrow, and a bright moon having arisen, I by\r\nits light continued working until I was quite worn out, and then at\r\nlength descended. I reached the ground, but to my surprise found that\r\nthe two boys were not there. They had not been seen. A moment afterward,\r\nhowever, all anxiety was dispelled, for among the topmost boughs I heard\r\ntheir young voices raised in the evening hymn. Instead of descending,\r\nthey had, while I was busy, climbed upward, and had been sitting in\r\nsilent admiration of the moonlight scene, high above me. They now joined\r\nus, and my wife showed me the results of her labor. She had made two\r\ncomplete sets of harness. I congratulated her upon her success, and we\r\nthen sat down to supper. On a cloth spread out upon the grass were\r\narranged a roast shoulder of porcupine, a delicious bowl of soup made\r\nfrom a piece of the same animal, cheese, butter, and biscuits, forming a\r\nmost tempting repast. Having done this ample justice, we collected our\r\ncattle, and the pigeons and fowls having retired to roost on the\r\nneighboring trees, and on the steps of our ladder, we made up a glorious\r\nfire to keep off any prowling wild beasts, and ourselves lay down. The\r\nchildren, in spite of the novelty of the hammocks, were quickly asleep.\r\nIn vain I tried to follow their example; a thousand anxious thoughts\r\npresented themselves, and as quickly as I dispelled them others rose in\r\ntheir place. The night wore on, and I was still awake; the fire burned\r\nlow, and I rose and replenished it with dry fuel. Then again I climbed\r\ninto my hammock, and toward morning fell asleep.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning we were astir, and dispersed to our various\r\noccupations. My wife milked the goats and cow, while we gave the animals\r\ntheir food, after which we went down to the beach to collect more wood\r\nfor our building operations. To the larger beams we harnessed the cow\r\nand ass, while we ourselves dragged up the remainder. Fritz and I then\r\nascended the tree, and finished the preparations I had begun the night\r\nbefore, all useless boughs we lopped off, leaving a few about six feet\r\nfrom the floor, from which we might sling our hammocks, and others still\r\nhigher, to support a temporary roof of sailcloth. My wife made fast the\r\nplanks to a rope passed through the block I had fixed to the boughs\r\nabove us, and by this means Fritz and I hauled them up. These we\r\narranged side by side on the foundation of boughs, so as to form a\r\nsmooth solid floor, and round this platform built a bulwark of planks,\r\nand then throwing the sailcloth over the higher branches, we drew it\r\ndown and firmly nailed it. Our house was thus enclosed on three sides,\r\nfor behind the great trunk protected us, while the front was left open\r\nto admit the fresh sea breeze which blew directly in. We then hauled up\r\nour hammocks and bedding and slung them from the branches we had left\r\nfor that purpose. A few hours of daylight still remaining, we cleared\r\nthe floor of leaves and chips, and then descended to fashion a table and\r\na few benches from the remainder of the wood. After working like slaves\r\nall day, Fritz and I flung ourselves on the grass, while my wife\r\narranged supper on the table we had made.\r\n\r\n"Come," said she at length, "come and taste flamingo stew, and tell me\r\nhow you like it. Ernest assured me that it would be much better stewed\r\nthan roasted, and I have been following his directions."\r\n\r\nLaughing at the idea of Ernest turning scientific cook, we sat down. The\r\nfowls gathered round us to pick up the crumbs, and the tame flamingo\r\njoined them, while Master Knips skipped about from one to the other,\r\nchattering and mimicking our gestures continually. To my wife\'s joy, the\r\nsow appeared shortly after, and was presented with all the milk that\r\nremained from the day\'s stock that she might be persuaded to return\r\nevery night.\r\n\r\n"For," said my wife, "this surplus milk is really of no use to us, as it\r\nwill be sour before the morning in this hot climate."\r\n\r\n"You are quite right," I replied, "but we must contrive to make it of\r\nuse. The next time Fritz and I return to the wreck we will bring off a\r\nchurn among the other things we require."\r\n\r\n"Must you really go again to that dreadful wreck?" said my wife\r\nshuddering. "You have no idea how anxious I am when you are away there."\r\n\r\n"Go we must, I am afraid," I replied, "but not for a day or two yet.\r\nCome, it is getting late. We and the chickens must go to roost."\r\n\r\nWe lit our watch-fires, and, leaving the dogs on guard below, ascended\r\nthe ladder. Fritz, Ernest, and Jack were up in a moment. Their mother\r\nfollowed very cautiously, for though she had originated the idea of\r\nbuilding a nest, she yet hesitated to entrust herself at such a terrific\r\nheight from the ground. When she was safely landed in the house, taking\r\nlittle Franz on my back, I let go the fastenings which secured the lower\r\nend of the ladder to the ground, and swinging to and fro, slowly\r\nascended.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time we stood all together in our new home. I drew up\r\nthe ladder, and, with a greater sense of security than I had enjoyed\r\nsince we landed on the island, offered up our evening prayer, and\r\nretired for the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n A day of rest--A parable for the young people--Quiet\r\n     recreation--Geographical nomenclature--The margay and porcupine\r\n     skins made of use--An expedition to Tentholm--Potatoes,\r\n     potatoes--Tropical vegetation--The use of the karatas--Jack\'s\r\n     greediness and its punishment--Ernest discovers cochineal--Arrive\r\n     at Tentholm--The poultry rebellious--Return to Falconhurst--Ernest\r\n     roused out early--We collect wood for a sledge--Master Knips turns\r\n     thief--Franz\'s plan for the saving of ammunition--Ernest and I\r\n     take the sledge to Tentholm--Ernest\'s laziness exemplified--He\r\n     catches a salmon--We start for home--Kill a kangaroo--And cook it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning all were early awake, and the children sprang about the\r\ntree like young monkeys.\r\n\r\n"What shall we begin to do, father?" they cried. "What do you want us to\r\ndo to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Rest, my boys," I replied, "rest."\r\n\r\n"Rest?" repeated they. "Why should we rest?"\r\n\r\n"\'Six days shalt thou labor and do all that thou hast to do, but on the\r\nseventh, thou shalt do no manner of work.\' This is the seventh day," I\r\nreplied, "on it, therefore, let us rest."\r\n\r\n"What, is it really Sunday?" asked Jack; "how jolly! oh, I won\'t do any\r\nwork, but I\'ll take a bow and arrow and shoot, and we\'ll climb about the\r\ntree and have fun all day."\r\n\r\n"That is not resting," said I, "that is not the way you are accustomed\r\nto spend the Lord\'s day."\r\n\r\n"No! but then we can\'t go to church here, and there is nothing else to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"We can worship here as well as at home," said I.\r\n\r\n"But there is no church, no clergyman, and no organ," said Franz.\r\n\r\n"The leafy shade of this great tree is far more beautiful than any\r\nchurch," I said; "there will we worship our Creator. Come, boys, down\r\nwith you: turn our dining hall into a breakfast room."\r\n\r\nThe children, one by one, slipped down the ladder.\r\n\r\n"My dear Elizabeth," said I, "this morning we will devote to the service\r\nof the Lord, and by means of a parable, I will endeavor to give the\r\nchildren some serious thoughts; but, without books, or the possibility\r\nof any of the usual Sunday occupations, we cannot keep them quiet the\r\nwhole day; afterward, therefore, I shall allow them to pursue any\r\ninnocent recreation they choose, and in the cool of the evening we will\r\ntake a walk."\r\n\r\nMy wife entirely agreed with my proposal, and having breakfasted, the\r\nfamily assembled round me, as we sat in the pleasant shade on the fresh,\r\nsoft green grass.\r\n\r\nAfter singing some hymns and offering heartfelt prayers to the Almighty\r\ngiver of all good, I told the children I would relate to them a parable\r\ninstead of preaching a sermon.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that would be delightful! I like the parables in the Bible better\r\nthan anything," said Frank. "When can we hear you read out of the Bible\r\nagain, father?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, my little boy, your words reproach me," returned I. "While eagerly\r\nstriving to procure from the ship what would feed our bodies and provide\r\nfor _their_ comfort, I blush to think that I have neglected the Bread of\r\nLife, the word of God. I shall search for a Bible on my next return to\r\nthe wreck: although our own books were nearly all destroyed, I am pretty\r\nsure to find one."\r\n\r\nAt these words my wife arose, and fetching her magic bag, she drew from\r\nit a copy of the Holy Scriptures, which I thankfully received from her\r\nhand; and, after reading aloud from its sacred pages, I spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n"A Great King, ruling in power and splendor over a vast realm of light\r\nand love, possessed within its boundaries a desolate and unfruitful\r\nisland. This spot he made the object of his special care; and, lavishing\r\non it all the varied resources of his might and goodness, it bloomed in\r\nbeauty, and became the happy residence of a band of colonists, who were\r\ncharged not only with the cultivation and improvement of the soil, but\r\neach, individually, was bound to cherish in his soul the spirit of love\r\nand true allegiance to his Sovereign. While this faithful union was\r\nmaintained, the colony flourished; and the noblest virtues exalted and\r\nrendered happy the existence of every member of the race. That a\r\ndiscontented and rebellious spirit should ever have infected these\r\nfortunate subjects of so loving a master, seems incredible, yet so it\r\nwas; disobedience and pride brought misery and punishment, the fair\r\nprospects of the colony were blighted, the labors of the colonists were\r\nunblessed, and total separation from the parent kingdom seemed\r\ninevitable. A message of pardon--of free forgiveness--was nevertheless\r\naccorded to these rebels; and to all who, humbly accepting it, molded\r\ntheir future lives to the will of the Great King (now revealed in a\r\ncharacter even more gracious than before), was held out the promise of\r\nremoval at last from among the ruins caused by the great rebellion, to\r\nthe glory and undimmed splendor of the realm of Light and Blessedness."\r\n\r\nHaving interested the children, I then, leaving allegory, pressed simply\r\nand earnestly home to each young heart the truths I sought to teach;\r\nand, with a short prayer for a blessing on my words, brought the service\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\nAfter a thoughtful pause, we separated, and each employed himself as he\r\nfelt disposed.\r\n\r\nI took some arrows and endeavored to point them with porcupine quills.\r\n\r\nFranz came to beg me to make a little bow and arrow for him to shoot\r\nwith, while Fritz asked my advice about the tiger cat skin and the cases\r\nhe was to contrive from it. Jack assisted with the arrow making, and\r\ninserting a sharp spine at one end of each reed made it fast with\r\npack-thread, and began to wish for glue to insure its remaining firm.\r\n\r\n"O Jack! Mamma\'s soup is as sticky as anything!" cried Franz; "shall I\r\nrun and ask for a cake of it?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, little goose! better look for some real glue in the tool-box."\r\n\r\n"There he will find glue, to be sure," said I, "and the soup would\r\nscarcely have answered your purpose. But Jack, my boy, I do not like to\r\nhear you ridicule your little brother\'s ideas. Some of the most valuable\r\ndiscoveries have been the result of thoughts which originally appeared\r\nno wiser than his."\r\n\r\nWhile thus directing and assisting my sons, we were surprised by hearing\r\na shot just over our heads; at the same moment two small birds fell dead\r\nat our feet, and looking up, we beheld Ernest among the branches, as\r\nbending his face joyfully toward us, he cried, "Well hit! well hit! a\r\ngood shot, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThen slipping down the ladder, and picking up the birds, he brought them\r\nto me. One was a kind of thrush, the other a small dove called the\r\nortolan, and esteemed a very great delicacy on account of its exquisite\r\nflavor. As the figs on which these birds came to feed were only just\r\nbeginning to ripen, it was probable that they would soon flock in\r\nnumbers to our trees; and by waiting until we could procure them in\r\nlarge quantities, we might provide ourselves with valuable food for the\r\nrainy season, by placing them, when half cooked, in cases with melted\r\nlard or butter poured over them.\r\n\r\nBy this time Jack had pointed a good supply of arrows, and industriously\r\npracticed archery. I finished the bow and arrows for Franz, and expected\r\nto be left in peace; but the young man next demanded a quiver, and I had\r\nto invent that also, to complete his equipment. It was easily done by\r\nstripping a piece of bark from a small tree, fitting a flat side and a\r\nbottom to it, and then a string. Attaching it to his shoulders, the\r\nyouthful hunter filled it with arrows and went off; looking, as his\r\nmother said, like an innocent little Cupid, bent on conquest.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, we were summoned to dinner, and all right willingly\r\nobeyed the call.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal I interested the boys very much by proposing to decide\r\non suitable names for the different spots we had visited on this coast.\r\n\r\n"For," said I, "it will become more and more troublesome to explain what\r\nwe mean, unless we do so. Beside which, we shall feel much more at home\r\nif we can talk as people do in inhabited countries: instead of saying,\r\nfor instance, \'the little island at the mouth of our bay, where we found\r\nthe dead shark,\' \'the large stream near our tent, across which we made\r\nthe bridge,\' \'that wood where we found cocoanuts, and caught the\r\nmonkey,\' and so on. Let us begin by naming the bay in which we landed.\r\nWhat shall we call it?"\r\n\r\n"Oyster Bay," said Fritz.\r\n\r\n"No, no!--Lobster Bay," cried Jack, "in memory of the old fellow who\r\ntook a fancy to my leg!"\r\n\r\n"I think," observed his mother, "that, in token of gratitude for our\r\nescape, we should call it Safety Bay."\r\n\r\nThis name met with general approbation, and was forthwith fixed upon.\r\n\r\nOther names were quickly chosen. Our first place of abode we called\r\nTentholm; the islet in the bay, Shark\'s Island; and the reedy swamp,\r\nFlamingo Marsh. It was some time before the serious question of a name\r\nfor our leafy castle could be decided. But finally it was entitled\r\nFalconhurst;[B] and we then rapidly named the remaining points: Prospect\r\nHill, the eminence we first ascended; Cape Disappointment, from whose\r\nrocky heights we had strained our eyes in vain search for our ship\'s\r\ncompany; and Jackal River, as a name for the large stream at our landing\r\nplace, concluded our geographical nomenclature.\r\n\r\n[B] _Horst_, in German, means "nest" or "eyrie."\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the boys went on with their various employments. Fritz\r\nfinished his cases, and Jack asked my assistance in carrying out his\r\nplan of making a cuirass for Turk out of the porcupine skin. After\r\nthoroughly cleansing the inside, we cut and fitted it round the body of\r\nthe patient dog; then when strings were sewn on and it became tolerably\r\ndry, he was armed with this ingenious coat of mail, and a most singular\r\nfigure he cut!\r\n\r\nJuno strongly objected to his friendly approaches, and got out of his\r\nway as fast as she could; and it was clear that he would easily put to\r\nflight the fiercest animal he might encounter, while protected by armor\r\nat once defensive and offensive.\r\n\r\nI determined to make also a helmet for Jack out of the remainder of the\r\nskin, which to his infinite delight I speedily did.\r\n\r\nAmid these interesting occupations the evening drew on, and after a\r\npleasant walk among the sweet glades near our abode, we closed our\r\nSabbath day with prayer and a glad hymn of praise, retiring to rest with\r\npeaceful hearts.\r\n\r\nNext morning, I proposed an expedition to Tentholm, saying I wished to\r\nmake my way thither by a different route. We left the tree well armed; I\r\nand my three elder sons each carrying a gun and game bag, while little\r\nFranz was equipped with his bow and quiver full of arrows. A most\r\ncurious party we formed: Fritz, adorned with his belt of margayskin, and\r\nJack, with his extraordinary head-dress, looked like a couple of young\r\nsavages. Their mother and I walked together: she, of the whole party,\r\nbeing the only one unarmed, carried a jar in which to get butter from\r\nTentholm; we were preceded by the dogs--Turk armed most effectually with\r\nhis cuirass of porcupine skin, and Juno keeping at a respectful distance\r\nfrom so formidable a companion. Master Knips fully intended to mount his\r\ncharger as usual; but when he saw him arrayed apparently in a new skin,\r\nhe approached him carefully, and touching him with one paw, discovered\r\nthat such a hide would make anything but an agreeable seat; the grimace\r\nhe made was most comical, and chattering vociferously he bounded toward\r\nJuno, skipped on her back, seated himself, and soon appeared perfectly\r\nreconciled to the change of steed. The flamingo saw us starting, and,\r\nhaving been much petted during the last day or two, considered himself\r\nentitled to accompany us; for some time he kept beside the children,\r\nfollowing first one and then another as they explored the wood on either\r\nside; their irregular course, however, at length disgusted him, and,\r\nabandoning them, he walked sedately by my side. We strolled on in the\r\ncool air, following the course of the stream; the great trees\r\novershadowed us, and the cool, green sward stretched away between them\r\nat our feet. The boys roamed ahead of me, intent on exploration.\r\nPresently I heard a joyful shout, and saw Ernest running at full speed\r\ntoward me, followed by his brothers. In his hand he held a plant, and,\r\npanting for breath, and with sparkling eyes, he held it up to me.\r\n\r\n"Potatoes! potatoes! father," he gasped out.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack, "acres and acres of potatoes!"\r\n\r\n"My dear Ernest," said I, for there was no mistaking the flower and\r\nleaf, and the light clear-green bulbous roots, "you have indeed made a\r\ndiscovery; with the potato we shall never starve."\r\n\r\n"But come and look at them," said Jack, "come and feast your eyes on\r\nthousands of potatoes."\r\n\r\nWe hurried to the spot: there, spread out before us, was a great tract\r\nof ground, covered with the precious plant.\r\n\r\n"It would have been rather difficult," remarked Jack, "not to have\r\ndiscovered such a great field."\r\n\r\n"Very likely," replied Ernest, smiling; "but I doubt if you would have\r\ndiscovered that it was a potato field."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," said Jack, "you are quite welcome, at all events, to the\r\nhonor of the discovery; I\'ll have the honor of being the first to get a\r\nsupply of them." So saying, he dug up, with hands and knife, a number of\r\nplants, and filled his game bag with the roots. The monkey followed his\r\nexample, and scratching away with his paws most cleverly, soon had a\r\nheap beside him. So delighted were we with the discovery, and so eager\r\nwere we to possess a large supply of the roots, that we stopped not\r\ndigging until every bag, pouch, and pocket was filled. Some wished to\r\nreturn at once to Falconhurst, to cook and taste our new acquisition;\r\nbut this I overruled, and we continued our march, heavily laden, but\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n"How," said I, "can we thank the Giver of all these blessings,\r\nsufficiently?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Franz, "we can say, \'We thank thee, O Lord, for all thy\r\ngoodness and mercy; and bless us for Jesus Christ\'s sake. Amen.\'"\r\n\r\n"That would not be sufficient," said Fritz. "Do you think it would be\r\nenough, just to say to father and mother: \'Thank you for all you do,\'\r\nand not to show them we were really thankful, by loving them and doing\r\nwhat we can to please them?"\r\n\r\n"You are quite right, Fritz," said I; "Franz did not say all that was\r\nnecessary, he should have added, \'Give me grace to do Thy will, and to\r\nobey Thee in all things.\'"\r\n\r\nAs we thus talked, we reached the head of our streamlet, where it fell\r\nfrom the rocks above in a beautiful, sparkling, splashing cascade. We\r\ncrossed and entered the tall grass on the other side. We forced our way\r\nthrough with difficulty, so thick and tangled were the reeds. Beyond\r\nthis, the landscape was most lovely. Rich tropical vegetation flourished\r\non every side: the tall, stately palms, surrounded by luxuriant ferns;\r\nbrilliant flowers and graceful creepers; the prickly cactus, shooting up\r\namidst them; aloe, jasmine, and sweet-scented vanilla; the Indian pea,\r\nand above all the regal pine-apple, loaded the breath of the evening\r\nbreeze with their rich perfume. The boys were delighted with the\r\npine-apple, and so eagerly did they fall to, that my wife had to caution\r\nthem that there were no doctors on our territory, and if they became\r\nill, they would have to cure themselves as best they might.\r\n\r\nThis advice, however, seemed to have small effect on my sons, and\r\nshowing Knips what they wanted, they sent him after the ripest and best\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus employed, I examined the other shrubs and bushes.\r\nAmong these I presently noticed one which I knew well from description\r\nto be the karatas.\r\n\r\n"Come here, boys," I said; "here is something of far more value than\r\nyour pine-apples. Do you see that plant with long pointed leaves and\r\nbeautiful red flower? That is the karatas. The filaments of the leaves\r\nmake capital thread, while the leaves themselves, bruised, form an\r\ninvaluable salve. The pith of this wonderful plant may be used either\r\nfor tinder or bait for fish. Suppose, Ernest, you had been wrecked here,\r\nhow would you have made a fire without matches, or flint and steel?"\r\n\r\n"As the savages do," replied he; "I would rub two pieces of wood\r\ntogether until they kindled."\r\n\r\n"Try it," I said; "but, if you please, try it when you have a whole day\r\nbefore you, and no other work to be done, for I am certain it would be\r\nnight before you accomplish the feat. But see here," and I broke a dry\r\ntwig from the karatas, and peeling off the bark, laid the pith upon a\r\nstone. I struck a couple of pebbles over it, and they emitting a spark,\r\nthe pith caught fire.\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted with the experiment. I then drew some of the\r\nthreads from the leaves, and presented them to my wife.\r\n\r\n"But what," said Fritz, "is the use of all these other prickly plants,\r\nexcept to annoy one? Here, for instance, is a disagreeable little tree."\r\n\r\n"That is an Indian fig," said I. "It grows best on dry, rocky ground;\r\nfor most of its nourishment is derived from the air. Its juice is used,\r\nI believe, medicinally, while its fruit is pleasant and wholesome."\r\n\r\nMaster Jack was off in a moment when he heard of a new delicacy, and\r\nattempted to gather some of the fruit, but in vain; the sharp thorns\r\ndefied his efforts, and with bleeding hands, and rueful countenance, he\r\nreturned. I removed the thorns from his hands, and making a sharp wooden\r\nskewer, I thrust it into a fig, and quickly twisted it from its branch\r\nand split it open with a knife, still holding it upon the skewer. The\r\nrest followed my example, and we regaled ourselves upon the fruit, which\r\nwe found excellent. Ernest carefully examined the fig he was eating.\r\n"What are these," he exclaimed presently; "little red insects! they\r\ncling all over the fruit, and I cannot shake them off. Can they be\r\ncochineal?"\r\n\r\nHe handed me the fig, and I examined it attentively.\r\n\r\n"You are quite right, my boy," I said; "there is no doubt this is the\r\nreal cochineal. However, though it is worth its weight in gold to\r\nEuropean traders, it is of little use to us, I am afraid unless any of\r\nyou care to appear in gay colors. The cochineal you know, forms the most\r\nlovely scarlet dye."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said Jack; "but we will take a lot of it when we go\r\nhome again. Now let us find something more useful to us." And they\r\nthereupon plied me incessantly with questions concerning every plant and\r\nshrub we passed.\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop," I said at length; "the most learned naturalist would be\r\nmuch puzzled with many of these trees, and I who have never seen any of\r\nthem before, and know them merely by description, cannot pretend to tell\r\nyou the names, or explain to you the use of one-quarter of them."\r\n\r\nDiscussing, however, the properties of such shrubs as I did know, we at\r\nlength reached Tentholm. Everything was safe, and we set to work to\r\ncollect what we wanted. I opened the butter cask, from which my wife\r\nfilled her pot. Fritz saw after the ammunition, and Jack and Ernest ran\r\ndown to the beach to capture the geese and ducks. This they found no\r\neasy matter, for the birds, left so long alone, were shy, and nothing\r\nwould induce them to come on shore and be caught. Ernest at length hit\r\nupon an ingenious plan. He took some pieces of cheese, and tied them to\r\nlong strings. This bait he threw into the water, and the hungry ducks\r\ninstantly made a grab at it; then with a little skillful maneuvering he\r\ndrew them on shore. While Jack and he were thus busily employed\r\ncatching and tying the rebels together by the feet, we procured a fresh\r\nsupply of salt, which we packed upon Turk\'s back, first relieving him of\r\nhis coat of mail. The birds we fastened to our game bags, and carefully\r\nclosing the door of our tent, started homeward by the seashore. After a\r\ncheerful and pleasant walk, we once more reached our woodland abode. I\r\nreleased the birds and, clipping their wings to prevent their leaving\r\nus, established them on the stream. Then, after a delicious supper of\r\npotatoes, milk, and butter, we ascended our tree and turned in.\r\n\r\nHaving remarked a great deal of driftwood on the sands the preceding\r\nevening, it occurred to me that it would be well to get some of it, and\r\nmake a kind of sledge, so that the labor of fetching what we wanted from\r\nour stores at Tentholm might not fall so heavily on ourselves.\r\n\r\nI awoke early, and roused Ernest as my assistant, wishing to encourage\r\nhim to overcome his natural fault of indolence. After a little\r\nstretching and yawning, he got up cheerfully, pleased with the idea of\r\nan expedition while the others still slept, and we made our way to the\r\nbeach, taking with us the donkey, who drew a large broad bough, which I\r\nexpected to find useful in bringing back our load.\r\n\r\nAs we went along, I remarked to Ernest that I supposed he was rather\r\nsorry for himself, and grudged leaving his cozy hammock and pleasant\r\ndreams at this untimely hour.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, do not laugh at my laziness! Indeed, I mean to cure myself\r\nof it. I am very glad to go with you. I intended to shoot some more of\r\nthe ortolans this morning, but there will be plenty of time afterward.\r\nThe boys will be shooting at them, I daresay, but I don\'t expect they\r\nwill have any great luck."\r\n\r\n"Why not, pray?" inquired I.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe they will know what shot to use at first, and, besides,\r\nthey will most likely shoot upward at the birds and be sure to miss\r\nthem, on account of the great height and thickness of the branches and\r\nfoliage."\r\n\r\n"Well, Ernest, you certainly possess the gifts of prudence and\r\nreflection, as well as observation. These are valuable; but sudden\r\naction is so often necessary in life, that I advise you to cultivate the\r\npower of instantly perceiving and deciding what must be done in cases of\r\nemergency. Presence of mind is a precious quality, which, although\r\nnatural in some characters, may be acquired in a certain degree by all\r\nwho train themselves to it."\r\n\r\nOnce on the seashore, our work was quickly accomplished, for, selecting\r\nthe wood I thought fit for my purpose, we laid it across the broad,\r\nleafy branch, and, with some help from us, the donkey dragged a very\r\nfair load of it homeward, with the addition of a small chest, which I\r\nraised from among the sand, which nearly covered it.\r\n\r\nWe heard the boys popping away at the birds as we drew near. They\r\nhastened to meet us, and inquired where we had been, looking curiously\r\nat the chest, which I allowed them to open, while I asked my wife to\r\nexcuse our "absence without leave," and after submitting to her gentle\r\nreprimand, I explained my plan for a sledge, which pleased her greatly,\r\nand she already imagined it loaded with her hogshead of butter, and on\r\nits way from Tentholm to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nThe chest proved to be merely that of a common sailor, containing his\r\nclothes, very much wetted by the sea water.\r\n\r\nThe boys exhibited an array of several dozen birds, and related, during\r\nbreakfast, the various incidents of failure and success which had\r\nattended their guns. Ernest had rightfully guessed the mistakes they\r\nwould make, but practice was making them perfect, and they seemed\r\ndisposed to continue their sport, when their mother, assuring them that\r\nshe could not use more birds than those already killed, asked if I did\r\nnot think some means of snaring them might be contrived, as much powder\r\nand shot would be expended if they fired on at this rate.\r\n\r\nEntirely agreeing with this view of the subject, I desired the lads to\r\nlay aside their guns for the present, and the younger ones readily\r\napplied themselves to making snares of the long threads drawn from the\r\nleaves of the karatas, in a simple way I taught them, while Fritz and\r\nErnest gave me substantial assistance in the manufacture of the new\r\nsledge.\r\n\r\nWe were busily at work, when a tremendous disturbance among our fowls\r\nled us to suppose that a fox or wild cat had got into their midst.\r\n\r\nThe cocks crowed defiantly, the hens fluttered and cackled in a state of\r\nthe wildest excitement. We hastened toward them, but Ernest remarking\r\nMaster Knips slipping away, as though conscious of some misdemeanor,\r\nwent to watch him, and presently caught him in the act of eating a\r\nnew-laid egg, which he had carried off and hidden among the grass and\r\nroots. Ernest found several others. These were very welcome to my wife,\r\nfor hitherto the hens had not presented us with any eggs. Hereafter she\r\ndetermined to imprison the monkey every morning until the eggs had been\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, as Jack was setting the newly made snares among the\r\nbranches, he discovered that a pair of our own pigeons were building in\r\nthe tree. It was very desirable to increase our stock of these pretty\r\nbirds, and I cautioned the boys against shooting near our tree while\r\nthey had nests there, and also with regard to the snares, which were\r\nmeant only to entrap the wild fig-eaters.\r\n\r\nAlthough my sons were interested in setting the snares, they by no means\r\napproved of the new order to economize the ammunition. No doubt they had\r\nbeen discussing this hardship, for little Franz came to me with a\r\nbrilliant proposal of his own.\r\n\r\n"Papa," said he, "why should not we begin to plant some powder and shot\r\nimmediately? It would be so much more useful than bare grain for the\r\nfowls."\r\n\r\nHis brothers burst into a roar of laughter, and I must confess I found\r\nit no easy matter to keep my countenance.\r\n\r\n"Come, Ernest," said I; "now we have had our amusement, tell the little\r\nfellow what gunpowder really is."\r\n\r\n"It is not seed at all, Franz," Ernest explained. "Gunpowder is made of\r\ncharcoal, sulphur, and saltpeter, mixed cleverly together; so you see it\r\ncannot be sown like corn, any more than shot can be planted like peas\r\nand beans."\r\n\r\nMy carpentering meantime went on apace. In order to shape my sledge with\r\nends properly turned up in front, I had chosen wood which had been part\r\nof the bow of the vessel, and was curved in the necessary way for my\r\npurpose. Two pieces, perfectly similar, formed the sides of my sleigh,\r\nor sledge, and I simply united these strongly by fixing short bars\r\nacross them. Then, when the ropes of the donkey\'s harness were attached\r\nto the raised points in front, the equipage was complete and ready for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nMy attention had been for some time wholly engrossed by my work, and I\r\nonly now observed that the mother and her little boys had been busily\r\nplucking above two dozen of the wild birds, and were preparing to roast\r\nthem, spitted in a row on a long, narrow sword blade, belonging to one\r\nof our ship\'s officers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed somewhat wasteful to cook so many at once; but my wife\r\nexplained that she was getting them ready for the butter-cask I was\r\ngoing to fetch for her on the new sledge, as I had advised her to\r\npreserve them half-cooked, and packed in butter.\r\n\r\nAmused at her promptitude, I could do nothing less than promise to go\r\nfor her cask directly after dinner. For her part she resolved in our\r\nabsence to have a grand wash of linen and other clothes, and she advised\r\nme to arrange regular baths for all the boys in future.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon Ernest and I were ready to be off, equipped as\r\nusual. Fritz presented us each with a neat case of margay skin to hang\r\nat our girdles.\r\n\r\nWe harnessed both cow and ass to the sledge, and, accompanied by Juno,\r\ncheerfully took our departure, choosing the way by the sands, and\r\nreaching Tentholm without accident or adventure.\r\n\r\nThere unharnessing the animals, we began at once to load the sledge,\r\nnot only with the butter cask, but with a powder chest, a barrel of\r\ncheese, and a variety of other articles--ball, shot, tools, and Turk\'s\r\narmor, which had been left behind on our last visit.\r\n\r\nOur work had so closely engaged our attention, that when we were ready\r\nto leave it and go in search of a good bathing place, we discovered that\r\nour two animals had wandered quite out of sight, having crossed the\r\nbridge to reach the good pasture beyond the river.\r\n\r\nI sent Ernest after them, and went alone to the extremity of the bay. It\r\nterminated in bold and precipitous cliffs, which extended into the deep\r\nwater, and rose abruptly, so as to form an inaccessible wall of rock and\r\ncrag. Swampy ground, overgrown with large canes, intervened between me\r\nand these cliffs. I cut a large bundle of the reeds, and returned to\r\nErnest. It was some time before I found him, comfortably extended full\r\nlength on the ground near the tent, and sleeping as sound as a top,\r\nwhile the cow and the ass, grazing at will, were again making for the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n"Get up, Ernest, you lazy fellow!" exclaimed I, much annoyed; "why don\'t\r\nyou mind your business? Look at the animals! They will be over the river\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\n"No fear of that, father," returned he, with the utmost composure. "I\r\nhave taken a couple of boards off the bridge. They won\'t pass the gap."\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ingenious device by which the boy had\r\nspared himself all trouble; at the same time I observed that it is wrong\r\nto waste the precious moments in sleep when duty has to be performed. I\r\nthen bid him go and collect some salt, which was wanted at home, while I\r\nwent to bathe.\r\n\r\nOn coming back, much refreshed, I again missed Ernest, and began to\r\nwonder whether he was still gathering salt, or whether he had lain down\r\nsomewhere to finish his nap, when I heard him loudly calling:\r\n\r\n"Father, father, I\'ve caught a fish! an immense fellow he is. I can\r\nscarcely hold him, he drags the line so!"\r\n\r\nHastening toward the spot, I saw the boy lying in the grass, on a point\r\nof land close to the mouth of the stream, and with all his might keeping\r\nhold of a rod. The line was strained to the utmost by the frantic\r\nefforts of a very large fish, which was attempting to free itself from\r\nthe hook.\r\n\r\nI quickly took the rod from him, and giving the fish more line, led him\r\nby degrees into shallow water. Ernest ran in with his hatchet and killed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a salmon of full fifteen pounds weight, and I was\r\ndelighted to think of taking such a valuable prize to the mother.\r\n\r\n"This is capital, Ernest!" cried I; "you have cleared yourself for once\r\nof the charge of laziness! Let us now carry this splendid salmon to the\r\nsledge. I will clean and pack it for the journey, that it may arrive in\r\ngood condition, while you go and take a bath in the sea."\r\n\r\nAll this being accomplished, we harnessed our beasts to the well-laden\r\nvehicle, and replacing the boards on the bridge, commenced the journey\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWe kept inland this time, and were skirting the borders of a grassy\r\nthicket, when Juno suddenly left us, and plunging into the bushes, with\r\nfierce barking hunted out, right in front of us, the most\r\nsingular-looking creature I ever beheld. It was taking wonderful flying\r\nleaps, apparently in a sitting posture, and got over the ground at an\r\nastonishing rate. I attempted to shoot it as it passed, but missed.\r\nErnest, who was behind me, observed its movements very coolly, and\r\nseeing that the dog was puzzled, and that the animal, having paused, was\r\ncrouching among the grass, went cautiously nearer, fired at the spot he\r\nhad marked, and shot it dead.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary appearance of this creature surprised us very much. It\r\nwas as large as a sheep, its head was shaped like that of a mouse; its\r\nskin also was of a mouse color, it had long ears like a hare, and a tail\r\nlike a tiger\'s. The fore-paws resembled those of a squirrel, but they\r\nseemed only half-grown, while the hind legs were enormous, and so long\r\nthat, when upright on them, the animal would look as if mounted on\r\nstilts.\r\n\r\nFor some time we stood silently wondering at the remarkable creature\r\nbefore us. I could not recollect to have seen or heard of any such.\r\n\r\n"Well, father," said Ernest at last, "I should say this was about the\r\nqueerest beast to be met with anywhere. I am glad I knocked it over. How\r\nthey will all stare when I carry it home!"\r\n\r\n"You have had a lucky day altogether, certainly," said I; "but I cannot\r\nthink what this animal can be. Examine its teeth, and let us see to what\r\nclass of mammalia it belongs. We may be led to guess at its name in that\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"I see four sharp incisor teeth, father--two upper, and two under, as a\r\nsquirrel has."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then he is a rodent. What rodents can you remember, Ernest?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know them all, but there are the mouse, the marmot, the\r\nsquirrel, the hare, the beaver, the jerboa----"\r\n\r\n"The jerboa!" I exclaimed, "the jerboa! now we shall have it. This is\r\nreally very like a jerboa, only far larger. It must be a kangaroo, one\r\nof the class of animals which has a pouch or purse beneath the body, in\r\nwhich its young can take refuge. They were discovered in New Holland, by\r\nthe great Captain Cook, and I congratulate you on being the first to\r\nobtain a specimen in New Switzerland!" I added, laughing, as I\r\nextemporized the name.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo was added to the already heavy load on our sledge, and we\r\nproceeded slowly, arriving late at Falconhurst, but meeting with the\r\nusual bright welcome.\r\n\r\nVery eager and inquisitive were the glances turned toward the sledge,\r\nfor the load piled on it surpassed all expectation; we on our part\r\nstaring in equal surprise at the extraordinary rig of the young folks\r\nwho came to meet us.\r\n\r\nOne wore a long night-shirt, which, with a belt, was a convenient length\r\nin front, but trailed behind in orthodox ghost fashion.\r\n\r\nAnother had on a very wide pair of trousers, braced up so short that\r\neach little leg looked like the clapper in a bell.\r\n\r\nThe third, buttoned up in a pea-jacket which came down to his ankles,\r\nlooked for all the world like a walking portmanteau.\r\n\r\nAmid much joking and laughter, the mother explained that she had been\r\nwashing all day, and while their clothes were drying, the boys amused\r\nthemselves by dressing up in things they found while rummaging the\r\nsailor\'s chest, and had kept them on, that Ernest and I might see the\r\nmasquerade. It certainly amused us, but made me regret that so little\r\nbelonging to ourselves had been saved from the wreck, in consequence of\r\nwhich the children had scarcely a change of linen.\r\n\r\nTurning now to our new acquisitions, we excited great interest by\r\nexhibiting each in turn; the large salmon, but more especially the\r\nkangaroo, surprised and delighted every one.\r\n\r\nFritz alone wore a look expressive of dissatisfaction, and I saw that he\r\nwas envious of his younger brother\'s success. Vexed that so noble a\r\nprize had fallen to Ernest\'s gun, instead of his own, he treated it\r\nrather slightingly; but I could see that he was struggling against his\r\njealous feelings, and he, after a while, succeeded in recovering his\r\ngood humor, and joined pleasantly in the conversation.\r\n\r\n"What a famous day\'s sport you have had altogether!" said he, coming\r\nclose up to me. "It will be my turn to go out with you next, will it\r\nnot, father? Just about here there is nothing to shoot, and I have found\r\nit very dull."\r\n\r\n"Still you have been doing your duty, my dear boy; you were entrusted\r\nwith the care of the family, and a youth of manly character will not\r\ndepend for happiness on mere excitement."\r\n\r\nAs the shades of night approached, we made haste to conclude the day\'s\r\nwork, by preparing the kangaroo, part for immediate use, and part for\r\nsalting. The animals were fed, and a plentiful allowance of salt made to\r\nthem. Our own supper of broiled salmon and potatoes was dispatched with\r\ngreat appetite, and we retired, with thankful hearts, to sound and\r\nwell-earned repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n Jack and Ernest disappear--Fritz and I start for the wreck--The boys\r\n     ambuscade--We form a raft--Ransack the vessel--Again embark--A\r\n     turtle in sight--Fritz harpoons it--The turtle acts as "Steam\r\n     Tug"--Safe ashore--Return home--Jack\'s clay field--A fresh\r\n     discovery--The mother\'s cellar--A trip to the wreck--The\r\n     pinnace--Jack\'s raid on the Lilliputians--A secret revealed--A new\r\n     method of grinding flour--Wholesome or poisonous?--Bread-making in\r\n     earnest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, while the breakfast was getting ready, I attended to the\r\nbeautiful skin of the kangaroo, which I was anxious to preserve entire;\r\nand afterward, when Fritz had prepared everything in readiness for our\r\ntrip to the wreck, I called Ernest and Jack in order to give them some\r\nparting injunctions. They, however, had disappeared directly after\r\nbreakfast, and their mother could only guess, that, as we required\r\npotatoes, they might have gone to fetch a supply. I desired her to\r\nreprove them, on their return, for starting away without leave; but, as\r\nit appeared they had taken Turk, I satisfied myself that no harm was\r\nlikely to befall them, although it was not without reluctance that I\r\nleft my dear wife alone with little Franz, cheering her with hopes of\r\nour speedy return with new treasures from the wreck.\r\n\r\nAdvancing steadily on our way, we crossed the bridge at Jackal River,\r\nwhen suddenly, to our no small astonishment, Jack and Ernest burst out\r\nof a hiding place where they had lain in wait for us, and were enchanted\r\nwith the startling effect of their unexpected appearance upon their\r\nunsuspecting father and brother. It was evident that they fully believed\r\nthey might now go with us to the wreck.\r\n\r\nTo this notion I at once put a decided stop, although I could not find\r\nin my heart to scold the two merry rogues for their thoughtless frolic,\r\nmore especially as I particularly wished to send back a message to my\r\nwife. I told them they must hurry home, so as not to leave their mother\r\nin suspense, although, as they were already so far, they might collect\r\nsome salt. And I instructed them to explain that, as my work on board\r\nwould take up a long time, she must try to bear with our absence for a\r\nnight. This I had meant to say when we parted, but my courage had\r\nfailed, knowing how much she would object to such a plan, and I had\r\nresolved to return in the evening.\r\n\r\nOn consideration, however, of the importance of constructing a raft,\r\nwhich was my intention in going, and finishing it without a second trip,\r\nI determined to remain on board for the night, as the boys had,\r\nunintentionally, given me the chance of sending a message to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, boys, take care of yourselves! we\'re off," shouted Fritz, as I\r\njoined him in the tub-boat, and we shoved off.\r\n\r\nThe current carried us briskly out of the bay; we were very soon moored\r\nsafely alongside the wreck, and scrambling up her shattered sides, stood\r\non what remained of the deck, and began at once to lay our plans.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make a raft fit to carry on shore a great variety of\r\narticles far too large and heavy for our present boat. A number of empty\r\nwater casks seemed just what was required for a foundation; we closed\r\nthem tightly, pushed them overboard, and arranging twelve of them side\r\nby side in rows of three, we firmly secured them together by means of\r\nspars, and then proceeded to lay a good substantial floor of planks,\r\nwhich was defended by a low bulwark. In this way we soon had a\r\nfirst-rate raft, exactly suited to our purpose.\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible to return to land that same evening, for\r\nwe were thoroughly fatigued by our labors, and had eaten only the light\r\nrefreshment we had brought in our wallets, scarcely desisting a moment\r\nfrom our work.\r\n\r\nRejoicing that we were not expected home, we now made an excellent\r\nsupper from the ship\'s provisions, and then rested for the night on\r\nspring mattresses, a perfect luxury to us, after our hard and narrow\r\nhammocks.\r\n\r\nNext morning we actively set about loading the raft and boat: first\r\ncarrying off the entire contents of our own cabins; and passing on to\r\nthe captain\'s room, we removed the furniture, as well as the doors and\r\nwindow-frames, with their bolts, bars, and locks. We next took the\r\nofficers\' chests, and those belonging to the carpenter and gunsmith; the\r\ncontents of these latter we had to remove in portions, as their weight\r\nwas far beyond our strength.\r\n\r\nOne large chest was filled with an assortment of fancy goods, and\r\nreminded us of a jeweler\'s shop, so glittering was the display of gold\r\nand silver watches, snuff-boxes, buckles, studs, chains, rings, and all\r\nmanner of trinkets; these, and a box of money, drew our attention for a\r\ntime; but more useful to us at present was a case of common knives and\r\nforks, which I was glad to find, as more suited to us than the smart\r\nsilver ones we had previously taken on shore. To my delight we found,\r\nmost carefully packed, a number of young fruit trees: and we read on the\r\ntickets attached to them the names, so pleasant to European ears, of the\r\napple, pear, chestnut, orange, almond, peach, apricot, plum, cherry, and\r\nvine.\r\n\r\nThe cargo, which had been destined for the supply of a distant colony,\r\nproved, in fact, a rich and almost inexhaustible treasure to us.\r\nIronmongery, plumber\'s tools, lead, paint, grindstones, cart wheels, and\r\nall that was necessary for the work of a smith\'s forge, spades and\r\nplowshares, sacks of maize, peas, oats, and wheat, a hand-mill, and also\r\nthe parts of a saw-mill so carefully numbered that, were we strong\r\nenough, it would be easy to put it up, had been stowed away.\r\n\r\nSo bewildered were we by the wealth around us that for some time we\r\nwere at a loss as to what to remove to the raft. It would be impossible\r\nto take everything; yet the first storm would complete the destruction\r\nof the ship, and we should lose all we left behind. Selecting a number\r\nof the most useful articles, however, including of course the grain and\r\nthe fruit trees, we gradually loaded our raft. Fishing lines, reels,\r\ncordage, and a couple of harpoons were put on board, as well as a\r\nmariner\'s compass.\r\n\r\nFritz, recollecting our encounter with the shark, placed the harpoons in\r\nreadiness; and amused me by seeming to picture himself a whaler,\r\nflourishing his harpoon in most approved fashion.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon, both our crafts were heavily laden, and we were\r\nready to make for the shore. The voyage was begun with considerable\r\nanxiety, as, with the raft in tow, there was some danger of an accident.\r\n\r\nBut the sea being calm and the wind favorable, we found we could spread\r\nthe sail, and our progress was very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nPresently, Fritz asked me for the telescope, as he had observed\r\nsomething curious floating at a distance. Then handing it back, he\r\nbegged me to examine the object; which I soon discovered to be a turtle\r\nasleep on the water, and of course unconscious of our approach.\r\n\r\n"Do, father, steer toward it!" exclaimed he.\r\n\r\nI accordingly did so, that he might have a nearer look at the creature.\r\nLittle did I suspect what was to follow. The lad\'s back was turned to\r\nme, and the broad sail was between us, so that I could not perceive his\r\nactions; when, all of a sudden, I experienced a shock, and the thrill of\r\nline running through a reel. Before I had time to call out, a second\r\nshock, and the sensation of the boat being rapidly drawn through the\r\nwater, alarmed me.\r\n\r\n"Fritz, what are you about?" cried I, "you are sending us to the\r\nbottom."\r\n\r\n"I have him, hurrah! I have him safe!" shouted he, in eager excitement.\r\n\r\nTo my amazement, I perceived that he really had struck the tortoise with\r\na harpoon; a rope was attached to it, and the creature was running away\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nLowering the sail and seizing my hatchet, I hastened forward, in order\r\nto cut the line, and cast adrift at once turtle and harpoon.\r\n\r\n"Father! do wait!" pleaded the boy, "there is no danger just yet? I\r\npromise to cut the line myself the instant it is necessary! Let us catch\r\nthis turtle if we possibly can."\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, the turtle will be a very dear bargain, if he upsets all\r\nour goods into the sea, even if he does not drown us too. For Heaven\'s\r\nsake be careful! I will wait a few minutes, but the minute there is\r\ndanger, cut the line."\r\n\r\nAs the turtle began to make for the open sea, I hoisted the sail again;\r\nand, finding the opposition too much for it, the creature again directed\r\nits course landward, drawing us rapidly after it. The part of the shore\r\nfor which the turtle was making was considerably to the left of our\r\nusual landing place. The beach there shelved very gradually, and at some\r\ndistance from land we grounded with a sharp shock, but fortunately\r\nwithout a capsize.\r\n\r\nThe turtle was evidently greatly exhausted, and no wonder, since it had\r\nbeen acting the part of a steam tug, and had been dragging, at full\r\nspeed, a couple of heavily laden vessels. Its intention was to escape to\r\nland; but I leaped into the water, and wading up to it, dispatched it\r\nwith my ax. Such was its tenacity of life, however, that it did not\r\ncease its struggles, until I had actually severed its head from its\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAs we were by no means far from Falconhurst, Fritz gave notice of our\r\napproach by firing off his gun, as well as shouting loudly in his glee;\r\nand, while we were yet engaged in securing our boats and getting the\r\nturtle on shore, the whole family appeared in the distance, hastening\r\neagerly toward us; and our new prize, together with the well-laden boat\r\nand raft, excited the liveliest interest; my wife\'s chief pleasure,\r\nhowever, consisted in seeing us back, as our night\'s absence had\r\ndisturbed her, and she was horrified by the description of our dangerous\r\nrun in the wake of the fugitive turtle.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to remove some of our goods before night, the boys ran off\r\nto fetch the sledge; while I, having no anchor, contrived to moor the\r\nboats by means of some of the heavy blocks of iron we had brought.\r\n\r\nIt required our united strength to get the turtle hoisted on to the\r\nsledge, its weight being prodigious; we found it, indeed, with the\r\naddition of the sapling fruit trees, quite a sufficient load.\r\n\r\nWe then made the best of our way home, chatting merrily about our\r\nvarious adventures. The first thing to be done on arriving was to obtain\r\nsome of the turtle\'s flesh and cook it for supper. To my wife this\r\nappeared necessarily a work of time, as well as of difficulty; but I\r\nturned the beast on its back, and soon detached a portion of the meat\r\nfrom the breast with a hatchet, by breaking the lower shell: and I then\r\ndirected that it should be cooked, with a little salt, shell and all.\r\n\r\n"But let me first cut away this disgusting green fat," said my wife,\r\nwith a little shudder. "See how it sticks all over the meat. No one\r\ncould eat anything so nasty."\r\n\r\n"Leave that fat, whatever you do!" exclaimed I. "Why, my dear, that is\r\nthe very best part, and the delight of the epicure. If there be really\r\ntoo much, cut some off--it can be used as lard, and let the dogs make a\r\nsupper of the refuse."\r\n\r\n"And the handsome shell!" cried Fritz; "I should like to make a\r\nwater-trough of that, to stand near the brook, and be kept always full\r\nof clear water. How useful it would be!"\r\n\r\n"That is a capital idea," I replied, "and we may manage it easily, if we\r\ncan find clay so as to make a firm foundation on which to place it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, as to clay," said Jack, "I have a grand lump of clay there under\r\nthat root."\r\n\r\n"Well done, my lad! when did you find it?"\r\n\r\n"He found a bed of clay near the river this morning," said his mother,\r\n"and came home in such a mess, I had regularly to scrape his clothes and\r\nwash him thoroughly!"\r\n\r\n"Well, mother, I can only tell you I should never in all my days have\r\nfound the clay, if I had not slipped and fallen among it."\r\n\r\n"That I can well believe," returned his mother; "only, to hear your talk\r\nthis morning, one would have thought your discovery of clay the result\r\nof very arduous search indeed."\r\n\r\n"When you have ended the question of the clay and the turtle shell,"\r\nsaid Ernest, "I should like to show you some roots I found to-day; they\r\nare getting rather dry now. They look something like radishes, although\r\nthe plant itself was almost a bush; but I have not ventured to taste\r\nthem, although our old sow was devouring them at a great rate."\r\n\r\n"In that you did wisely, my boy. Swine eat many things injurious to men.\r\nLet me see your roots. How did you discover them?"\r\n\r\n"I was rambling in the wood this morning, and came upon the sow, very\r\nbusy grubbing under a small bush, and eating something ravenously; so I\r\ndrove her away, and found a number of these roots, which I brought for\r\nyou to see."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Ernest," I exclaimed, after taking the roots in my hand and\r\nconsidering them attentively, "I am inclined to believe that you have\r\nreally made a brilliant discovery! If this proves to be, as I expect,\r\nthe manioc root, we might lose every other eatable we possess, and yet\r\nnot starve. In the West Indies, cakes called cassava bread are made from\r\nit; and, already having potatoes, we shall be very independent if we can\r\nsucceed in preparing flour from these roots. Great care must be taken in\r\nthe manufacture to express the juice, otherwise the flour may be\r\ninjurious and even poisonous.\r\n\r\n"If we can collect a sufficient quantity, we will attempt bread-making.\r\nI think I know how to set about it."\r\n\r\nFinding there was still time to make another trip with the sledge, I\r\nwent off with the elder boys, leaving Franz with his mother; and we all\r\nlooked forward with satisfaction to the prospect of the princely supper\r\nthey were to have ready for us, for our day\'s work had been none of the\r\nlightest.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking about my turtle, father," said Fritz, as we went\r\nalong; "is not the shell very valuable? Surely beautiful combs, boxes,\r\nand a number of ornamental things are made of tortoise shell, and if so,\r\nit seems a pity to use it for a water trough."\r\n\r\n"Your turtle, Fritz, is only fit for eating, its shell is worthless\r\nas regards ornament; whereas the species whose shell is prized so much\r\nis unfit for food. Tortoise shell is subjected to the action of the\r\nheat, the outer layer peels off, leaving a beautifully marked,\r\nsemi-transparent surface, which is susceptible of a very high polish."\r\n\r\nThe sledge quickly received its second load from the raft. Chests, four\r\ncart-wheels, and the hand-mill were placed on it, with all manner of\r\nsmaller articles, and we lost no time in returning to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nThe mother welcomed us joyfully, for she said we had been regularly\r\noverworked during the last two days. "However, now you are come home to\r\nrest," said she, "and you little think what refreshment awaits you here\r\nin the shade. Come and see my cellar!" and she smilingly exhibited a\r\nsmall cask, half sunk in the ground, and well sheltered with leaves and\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you wonder where this came from," continued the mother; "well, I\r\nfound it myself on the sands, to-day, while you were all absent; and\r\nfancying it was wine of some sort, I got it up here on purpose to be\r\nready for you. The boys are most anxious to know what sort of wine it\r\nwill prove to be."\r\n\r\nAs the simplest method of ascertaining this, I inserted a straw at the\r\nvent-hole, and presently announced, that in all my life I had never\r\nenjoyed a more delicious draught of Canary sack. The mother was\r\nimmediately pleased to find that her exertions in my behalf had not been\r\nthrown away, and the boys pressed around me, armed with straws and\r\nbegging for a taste.\r\n\r\nAfter so strongly expressing my own enjoyment of the wine, it seemed\r\nunreasonable to deny them this, and I let them come in turns, but was\r\nspeedily obliged to call a halt; for the rogues got so eager and excited\r\nthat I had to reprove them for their greediness, and warn them of the\r\nrisk they ran of being intoxicated. In fact, I blamed myself for\r\nallowing them to have this strong wine as a beverage at all. They were\r\nwholly unaccustomed to it, and were, besides, fatigued and very hungry.\r\nSupper was more to the purpose; and, as the turtle proved delicious, it\r\nwas heartily enjoyed, and gave us strength to haul the mattresses we had\r\nbrought from the ship up into our sleeping rooms, so that very\r\nrefreshing slumbers closed the day.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I got up without rousing any of the others, intending\r\nto pay a visit to the beach; for I had my doubts about the safety of my\r\nvessels on the open shore. The dogs were delighted when I descended the\r\nladder, and bounded to meet me; the cocks crowed and flapped their\r\nwings; two pretty kids gamboled around; all was life and energy; the ass\r\nalone seemed disinclined to begin the day, and as I especially required\r\nhis services, this was unfortunate. I put his morning dreams to flight,\r\nhowever, and harnessed him to the sledge; the cow, as she had not been\r\nmilked, enjoyed the privilege of further repose, and, with the rest of\r\nthe family, I left her dozing.\r\n\r\nMy fears as to the safety of the boats were soon dispelled, for they\r\nwere all right; and, being in haste to return, the load I collected from\r\ntheir freight was but a light one, and the donkey willingly trotted home\r\nwith it, he, as well as I, being uncommonly ready for breakfast.\r\nApproaching the tree, not a sound was to be heard, not a soul was to be\r\nseen, although it was broad day; and great was my good wife\'s surprise,\r\nwhen, roused by the clatter and hullabaloo I made, she started up, and\r\nbecame aware of the late hour!\r\n\r\n"What can have made us oversleep ourselves like this?" she exclaimed.\r\n"It must be the fault of those mattresses; they are delightful, but\r\nreally too lulling; see, the children are sound asleep still."\r\n\r\nWith much stretching and many yawns, the boys at last came tumbling down\r\nfrom the tree, rubbing their eyes and seeming but half awake; Ernest\r\nlast, as usual.\r\n\r\n"Come, my boys," said I, "this will never do! Your beds were too\r\nluxurious last night, I see." In my own opinion, however, I felt there\r\nwas something else to blame besides the comfortable mattresses, and I\r\nmade a mental resolve that the captain\'s fine Canary should be dealt\r\nwith very sparingly in future. "So now for prayers and breakfast," I\r\ncontinued, "and then off to work. I must have our cargo landed in time\r\nto get the boats off with the next tide."\r\n\r\nBy dint of downright hard work, we accomplished this, and I got on board\r\nwith Fritz as soon as they were afloat; the rest turned homeward, but\r\nJack lingered behind with such imploring looks, that I could not resist\r\ntaking him with me.\r\n\r\nMy intention had been simply to take the vessels round to the harbor in\r\nSafety Bay, but the calm sea and fine weather tempted me to make another\r\ntrip to the wreck. It took up more time than I expected, so that, when\r\non board, we could only make a further examination of the cargo, collect\r\na few portable articles, and then avail ourselves of the sea-breeze\r\nwhich would fail us later in the evening.\r\n\r\nTo Jack the pleasure of hunting about in the hold was novel and\r\ncharming, and very soon a tremendous rattling and clattering heralded\r\nhis approach with a wheel-barrow, in the highest spirits at his good\r\nfortune in having found such a capital thing in which to bring home\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by Fritz, whose news was still more important. He had\r\nfound, carefully packed and enclosed within partitions, what appeared to\r\nbe the separate parts of a pinnace, with rigging and fittings complete,\r\neven to a couple of small brass guns. This was a great discovery, and I\r\nhastened to see if the lad was right. Indeed he was, but my pleasure was\r\nqualified by a sense of the arduous task it would be to put such a craft\r\ntogether so as to be fit for sea. For the present we had barely time to\r\nget something to eat and hurry into the boat, where were collected our\r\nnew acquisitions, namely, a copper boiler, iron plates, tobacco-graters,\r\ntwo grindstones, a small barrel of powder, and another of flints, two\r\nwheel-barrows, besides Jack\'s, which he kept under his own especial\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the shore, we were surprised to see a number of little\r\nfigures ranged in a row along the water\'s edge, and apparently gazing\r\nfixedly at us. They seemed to wear dark coats and white waistcoats, and\r\nstood quite still with their arms dropping by their sides, only every\r\nnow and then one would extend them gently, as though longing to embrace\r\nus.\r\n\r\n"Ah! here at last come the pigmy inhabitants of the country to welcome\r\nus!" cried I, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father!" exclaimed Jack, "I hope they are Lilliputians! I once read\r\nin a book about them, so there must be such people, you know, only these\r\nlook rather too large."\r\n\r\n"You must be content to give up the Lilliputians and accept penguins, my\r\ndear Jack," said I. "We have not before seen them in such numbers, but\r\nErnest knocked one down, if you remember, soon after we landed. They can\r\nneither fly nor run."\r\n\r\nWe were gradually approaching the land as I spoke, and no sooner was the\r\nwater shallow, than out sprang Jack from his tub, and wading ashore,\r\ntook the unsuspecting birds by surprise, and with his stick laid half a\r\ndozen, right and left, either stunned or dead at his feet. The rest\r\nescaped into the water, dived, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs these penguins are disagreeable food, on account of their strong,\r\noily taste, I was sorry Jack had attacked them; but going to examine\r\nthem when we landed, some of the fallen arose from their swoon, and\r\nbegan solemnly to waddle away, upon which we caught them, and tying\r\ntheir feet together with long grass, laid them on the sand to wait until\r\nwe were ready to start.\r\n\r\nThe three wheel-barrows then each received a load, the live penguins,\r\nseated gravely, were trundled along by Jack, and away we went at a great\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThe usual noise of our approach set the dogs barking furiously, but\r\ndiscovering us, they rushed forward with such forcible demonstrations of\r\ndelight, that poor little Jack, who, as it was, could scarcely manage\r\nhis barrow, was fairly upset, penguins and all. This was too much for\r\nhis patience, and it was absurd to see how he started up and cuffed them\r\nsoundly for their boisterous behavior.\r\n\r\nThis scene, and the examination of our burdens, caused great merriment:\r\nthe tobacco-grater and iron plates evidently puzzling everybody.\r\n\r\nI sent the boys to catch some of our geese and ducks, and bid them\r\nfasten a penguin to each by the leg, thinking that it was worth while to\r\ntry to tame them.\r\n\r\nMy wife had exerted herself in our absence to provide a good store of\r\npotatoes, and also of manioc root. I admired her industry, and little\r\nFranz said, "Ah, father! I wonder what you will say when mother and I\r\ngive you some Indian corn, and melons, and pumpkins, and cucumbers!"\r\n\r\n"Now, you little chatterbox!" cried she, "you have let out my secret! I\r\nwas to have the pleasure of surprising your father when my plants were\r\ngrowing up."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the poor disappointed little mother!" said I. "Never mind! I am\r\ncharmed to hear about it. Only do tell me where did these seeds come\r\nfrom?"\r\n\r\n"Out of my magic bag, of course!" replied she. "And each time I have\r\ngone for potatoes, I have sown seeds in the ground which was dug up to\r\nget them; and I have planted potatoes also."\r\n\r\n"Well done, you wise little woman!" I exclaimed. "Why, you are a model\r\nof prudence and industry!"\r\n\r\n"But," continued she, "I do not half like the appearance of those\r\ntobacco-graters you have brought. Is it possible you are going to make\r\nsnuff? Do, pray, let us make sure of abundance of food for our mouths,\r\nbefore we think of our noses!"\r\n\r\n"Make your mind easy, my wife," said I. "I have not the remotest\r\nintention of introducing the dirty, ridiculous habit of snuffing into\r\nyour family! Please to treat my graters with respect, however, because\r\nthey are to be the means of providing you with the first fresh bread you\r\nhave seen this many a long day."\r\n\r\n"What possible connection can there be between bread and\r\ntobacco-graters? I cannot imagine what you mean, and to talk of bread\r\nwhere there are no ovens is only tantalizing."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you must not expect real loaves," said I. "But on these flat iron\r\nplates I can bake flat cakes or scones, which will be excellent bread; I\r\nmean to try at once what I can do with Ernest\'s roots. And first of all,\r\nI want you to make a nice strong canvas bag."\r\n\r\nThis the mother willingly undertook to do, but she evidently had not\r\nmuch faith in my powers as a baker, and I saw her set on a good potful\r\nof potatoes before beginning to work, as though to make sure of a meal\r\nwithout depending on my bread.\r\n\r\nSpreading a piece of sailcloth on the ground, I summoned my boys to set\r\nto work. Each took a grater and a supply of well-washed manioc root, and\r\nwhen all were seated round the cloth--"Once, twice, thrice! Off!" cried\r\nI, beginning to rub a root as hard as I could against the rough surface\r\nof my grater. My example was instantly followed by the whole party, amid\r\nbursts of merriment, as each remarked the funny attitude and odd\r\ngestures of his neighbors while vehemently rubbing, rasping, grating,\r\nand grinding down the roots allotted to him. No one was tempted by the\r\nlook of the flour to stop and taste it, for in truth it looked much like\r\nwet sawdust.\r\n\r\n"Cassava bread is highly esteemed in many parts of the New World, and I\r\nhave heard that some Europeans there prefer it to the wheaten bread of\r\ntheir own country. There are various species of manioc. One sort grows\r\nquickly, and its roots ripen in a very short time. Another kind is of\r\nsomewhat slower growth. The roots of the third kind do not come to\r\nmaturity for two years. The two first are poisonous, if eaten raw, yet\r\nthey are preferred to the third, which is harmless, because they are so\r\nmuch more fruitful, and the flour produced is excellent, if the\r\nscrapings are carefully pressed."\r\n\r\n"What is the good of pressing them, father?" inquired Ernest.\r\n\r\n"It is in order to express the sap, which contains poison. The dry pith\r\nis wholesome and nourishing. Still, I do not mean to taste my cakes,\r\nuntil I have tried the effect on our fowls and the ape."\r\n\r\nBy this time our supply of roots being reduced to damp powder, the\r\ncanvas bag was filled with it, and tying it tightly up, I attempted to\r\nsqueeze it, but soon found that mechanical aid was necessary in order to\r\nexpress the moisture. My arrangements for this purpose were as follows:\r\nA strong, straight beam was made flat on one side, smooth planks were\r\nlaid across two of the lower roots of our tree; on these we placed the\r\nsack, above the sack another plank, and over that the long beam; one end\r\nwas passed under a root near the sack, the other projected far forward.\r\nAnd to that we attached all the heaviest weights we could think of, such\r\nas an anvil, iron bars, and masses of lead. The consequent pressure on\r\nthe bag was enormous, and the sap flowed from it to the ground.\r\n\r\n"Will this stuff keep any time?" inquired my wife, who came to see how\r\nwe were getting on. "Or must all this great bagful be used at once? In\r\nthat case we shall have to spend the whole of to-morrow in baking\r\ncakes."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," I replied; "once dry, the flour in barrels will keep fresh\r\na long time. We shall use a great deal of this, however, as you shall\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"Do you think we might begin now, father?" said Fritz. "There does not\r\nseem the least moisture remaining."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said I. "But I shall only make one cake to-day for an\r\nexperiment; we must see how it agrees with Master Knips and the hens\r\nbefore we set up a bakehouse in regular style."\r\n\r\nI took out a couple of handfuls of flour for this purpose, and with a\r\nstick loosened and stirred the remainder, which I intended should be\r\nagain pressed. While an iron plate, placed over a good fire, was getting\r\nhot, I mixed the meal with water and a little salt, kneaded it well, and\r\nforming a thickish cake, laid it on the hot plate, when one side\r\npresently becoming a nice yellow-brown color, it was turned and was\r\nquickly baked.\r\n\r\nIt smelt so delicious that the boys quite envied the two hens and the\r\nmonkey, who were selected as the subjects of this interesting\r\nexperiment, and they silently watched them gobbling up the bits of cake\r\nI gave them, until Fritz turned to me, saying, "Suppose the cake is\r\npoisonous, what effect will it have on the creatures? Will they be\r\nstupefied, or will they suffer pain?"\r\n\r\n"That depends upon the nature of the poison. Some cause violent pain, as\r\ncolchicum, hellebore, and aconite. Others produce stupefaction and\r\nparalysis, as opium, hemlock, and prussic acid; while others again, as\r\nstrychnine, are followed by violent convulsions, or, as belladonna, by\r\ndelirium. The effects of course vary according to the quantity taken,\r\nand such remedies should be applied as will best counteract the effect\r\nof each poison: emetics in any case, to remove as much as possible of\r\nthe noxious substance, combined with oils and mucilaginous drinks to\r\nsoothe and protect the stomach in case of irritants; stimulants, such as\r\nspirits, ammonia, or strong coffee to rouse from the stupor of the\r\nnarcotics; and sedative drugs, which are perhaps in themselves poisons,\r\nto counteract the over stimulation of the nerves caused by the\r\nconvulsant poisons. But now let us think no more of poisons; here is\r\nsupper ready and we need not be afraid to eat roast penguin and\r\npotatoes."\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done; we left the fowls picking up the least crumb\r\nthey could find of the questionable food, and assembled to enjoy our\r\nevening meal. The potatoes were, as usual, excellent, the penguin was\r\nreally not so bad as I expected, although fishy in taste and very tough.\r\n\r\nNext morning every one expressed the tenderest concern as to the health\r\nof Knips and the hens; and lively pleasure was in every countenance when\r\nJack, who ran first to make the visit inquiry, brought news of their\r\nperfect good health and spirits.\r\n\r\nNo time was now to be lost, and the bread-baking commenced in earnest. A\r\nlarge fire was kindled, the plates heated, the meal made into cakes,\r\neach of the boys busily preparing his own, and watching the baking most\r\neagerly. Mistakes occurred, of course; some of the bread was burnt, some\r\nnot done enough; but a pile of nice, tempting cakes was at length ready,\r\nand with plenty of good milk we breakfasted right royally, and in high\r\nspirits at our success.\r\n\r\nSoon after, while feeding the poultry with the fragments of the repast,\r\nI observed that the captive penguins were quite at ease among them and\r\nas tame as the geese and ducks; their bonds were therefore loosed, and\r\nthey were left as free as the other fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n Now for the pinnace--Repeated visits to the wreck--The pinnace\r\n     built--How shall we cut her out--The difficulty solved--We fit her\r\n     out--Fire a salute--The mother\'s surprise--We visit\r\n     Falconhurst--Attend to our fruit trees--Athletics--The lasso--An\r\n     excursion--A bustard captured--Ernest discovers a magician--Jack\r\n     fights him--The Liane Rouge--We turn carvers--Ernest\'s alarm--The\r\n     old sow again--We discover a sleeping beauty--Return with it to\r\n     the camp--Knips pronounces our apples "good"--Return to\r\n     Falconhurst.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now discovered how to provide bread for my family, my thoughts\r\nbegan to revert to the wreck and all the valuables yet contained within\r\nit. Above all, I was bent on acquiring possession of the beautiful\r\npinnace, and aware that our united efforts would be required to do the\r\nnecessary work, I began to coax and persuade the mother to let me go in\r\nforce with all her boys except Franz.\r\n\r\nShe very unwillingly gave her consent at last, but not until I had\r\nfaithfully promised never to pass a night on board. I did so with\r\nreluctance, and we parted, neither feeling quite satisfied with the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted to go in so large a party, and merrily carried\r\nprovision bags filled with cassava bread and potatoes.\r\n\r\nReaching Safety Bay without adventure we first paid a visit to the geese\r\nand ducks which inhabited the marsh there, and having fed them and seen\r\nthey were thriving well, we buckled on each his cork belt, stepped into\r\nthe tub-boat, and, with the raft in tow, steered straight for the wreck.\r\n\r\nWhen we got on board, I desired the boys to collect whatever came first\r\nto hand, and load the raft to be ready for our return at night, and\r\nthen we made a minute inspection of the pinnace.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that difficulties, well-nigh insuperable, lay\r\nbetween me and the safe possession of the beautiful little vessel. She\r\nlay in a most un-get-at-able position at the further end of the hold,\r\nstowed in so confined and narrow a space, that it was impossible to\r\nthink of fitting the parts together there. At the same time these parts\r\nwere so heavy, that removing them to a convenient place piece by piece\r\nwas equally out of the question.\r\n\r\nI sent the boys away to amuse themselves by rummaging out anything they\r\nliked to carry away, and sat down quietly to consider the matter.\r\n\r\nAs my eyes became used to the dim light which entered the compartment\r\nthrough a chink or crevice here and there, I perceived how carefully\r\nevery part of the pinnace was arranged and marked with numbers, so that\r\nif only I could bestow sufficient time on the work, and contrive space\r\nin which to execute it, I might reasonably hope for success.\r\n\r\n"Room! room to work in, boys! that\'s what we need in the first place!" I\r\ncried, as my sons came to see what plan I had devised, for so great was\r\ntheir reliance on me that they never doubted the pinnace was to be ours.\r\n\r\n"Fetch axes, and let us break down the compartment and clear space all\r\nround."\r\n\r\nTo work we all went, yet evening drew near, and but little impression\r\nwas made on the mass of woodwork around us. We had to acknowledge than\r\nan immense amount of labor and perseverance would be required before we\r\ncould call ourselves the owners of the useful and elegant little craft,\r\nwhich lay within this vast hulk like a fossil shell embedded in a rock.\r\n\r\nPreparations for returning to shore were hastily made, and we landed\r\nwithout much relish for the long walk to Falconhurst, when, to our great\r\nsurprise and pleasure, we found the mother and little Franz at Tentholm\r\nawaiting us. She had resolved to take up her quarters there during the\r\ntime we should be engaged on the wreck. "In that way you will live\r\nnearer your work, and I shall not quite lose sight of you!" said she,\r\nwith a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n"You are a good, sensible, kind wife," I exclaimed, delighted with her\r\nplan, "and we shall work with the greater diligence, that you may return\r\nas soon as possible to your dear Falconhurst."\r\n\r\n"Come and see what we have brought you, mother!" cried Fritz; "a good\r\naddition to your stores, is it not?" and he and his brothers exhibited\r\ntwo small casks of butter, three of flour, corn, rice, and many other\r\narticles welcome to our careful housewife.\r\n\r\nOur days were now spent in hard work on board, first cutting and\r\nclearing an open space round the pinnace, and then putting the parts\r\ntogether. We started early and returned at night, bringing each time a\r\nvaluable freight from the old vessel.\r\n\r\nAt length, with incredible labor, all was completed. The pinnace stood\r\nactually ready to be launched, but imprisoned within massive wooden\r\nwalls which defied our strength.\r\n\r\nIt seemed exactly as though the graceful vessel had awakened from sleep,\r\nand was longing to spring into the free blue sea, and spread her wings\r\nto the breeze. I could not bear to think that our success so far should\r\nbe followed by failure and disappointment. Yet no possible means of\r\nsetting her free could I conceive, and I was almost in despair, when an\r\nidea occurred to me which, if I could carry it out, would effect her\r\nrelease without further labor or delay.\r\n\r\nWithout explaining my purpose, I got a large cast-iron mortar, filled it\r\nwith gunpowder, secured a block of oak to the top, through which I\r\npierced a hole for the insertion of the match, and this great petard I\r\nso placed, that when it exploded it should blow out the side of the\r\nvessel next from which the pinnace lay. Then securing it with chains,\r\nthat the recoil might do no damage, I told the boys I was going ashore\r\nearlier than usual, and calmly desired them to get into the boat. Then\r\nlighting a match I had prepared, and which would burn some time before\r\nreaching the powder, I hastened after them with a beating heart, and we\r\nmade for the land.\r\n\r\nWe brought the raft close in shore and began to unload it; the other\r\nboat I did not haul up, but kept her ready to put off at a moment\'s\r\nnotice; my anxiety was unobserved by anyone, as I listened with strained\r\nnerves for the expected sound. It came!--a flash! a mighty roar--a grand\r\nburst of smoke!\r\n\r\nMy wife and children, terror-stricken, turned their eyes toward the sea,\r\nwhence the startling noise came, and then, in fear and wonder, looked to\r\nme for some explanation. "Perhaps," said the mother, as I did not speak,\r\n"perhaps you have left a light burning near some of the gunpowder, and\r\nan explosion has taken place."\r\n\r\n"Not at all unlikely," replied I quietly; "we had a fire below when we\r\nwere caulking the seams of the pinnace. I shall go off at once and see\r\nwhat has happened. Will any one come?"\r\n\r\nThe boys needed no second invitation, but sprang into the boat, while I\r\nlingered to reassure my wife by whispering a few words of explanation,\r\nand then joining them, we pulled for the wreck at a more rapid rate than\r\nwe ever had done before.\r\n\r\nNo alternation had taken place in the side at which we usually boarded\r\nher, and we pulled round to the further side, where a marvelous sight\r\nawaited us. A huge rent appeared, the decks and bulwarks were torn open,\r\nthe water was covered with floating wreckage--all seemed in ruins; and\r\nthe compartment where the pinnace rested was fully revealed to view.\r\nThere sat the little beauty, to all appearance uninjured; and the boys,\r\nwhose attention was taken up with the melancholy scene of ruin and\r\nconfusion around them, were astonished to hear me shout in enthusiastic\r\ndelight: "Hurrah! she is ours! The lovely pinnace is won! we shall be\r\nable to launch her easily after all. Come, boys, let us see if she has\r\nsuffered from the explosion which has set her free."\r\n\r\nThe boys gazed at me for a moment, and then guessing my secret, "You\r\nplanned it yourself, you clever, cunning father! Oh, that machine we\r\nhelped to make was on purpose to blow it up!" cried they; and eagerly\r\nthey followed me into the shattered opening, where, to my intense\r\nsatisfaction, I found everything as I could wish, and the captive in no\r\nway a sufferer from the violent measures I had adopted for her\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nThe boys were deeply interested in examining the effects of the\r\nexplosion, and in the explanation I gave them of the principle and\r\nproper way to manage a petard.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the launch could now be effected without much\r\ntrouble; I had been careful to place rollers beneath the keel, so that\r\nby means of levers and pulleys we might, with our united strength, move\r\nher forward toward the water. A rope was attached by which to regulate\r\nthe speed of the descent, and then, all hands putting their shoulders to\r\nthe work, the pinnace began to slide from the stocks, and finally\r\nslipped gently and steadily into the water, where she floated as if\r\nconscious it was her native element; while we, wild with excitement,\r\ncheered and waved enthusiastically. We then only remained long enough to\r\nsecure our prize carefully at the most sheltered point, and went back to\r\nTentholm, where we accounted for the explosion; saying that having blown\r\naway one side of the ship, we should be able to obtain the rest of its\r\ncontents with a very few more days\' work.\r\n\r\nThese days were devoted to completing the rigging, the mounting of her\r\ntwo little brass guns, and all necessary arrangements about the pinnace.\r\nIt was wonderful what martial ardor was awakened by the possession of a\r\nvessel armed with two real guns. The boys chattered incessantly about\r\nsavages, fleets of canoes, attack, defense, and final annihilation of\r\nthe invaders.\r\n\r\nI assured them that, brilliant as their victories would doubtless be, we\r\nshould have good cause to thank God if their fighting powers and\r\nnew-born valor were never put to the test.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace was fully equipped and ready to sail, while yet no idea of\r\nthe surprise we were preparing for her had dawned upon my wife, and I\r\npermitted the boys, who had kept the secret so well, to fire a salute\r\nwhen we entered the bay.\r\n\r\nCasting off from the ship, and spreading the sail, our voyage began. The\r\npinnace glided swiftly through the water. I stood at the helm, Ernest\r\nand Jack manned the guns, and Fritz gave the word of command, "Fire!"\r\nBang! bang! rattled out a thrilling report, which echoed and re-echoed\r\namong the cliffs, followed by our shouts and hurrahs.\r\n\r\nThe mother and her little boy rushed hastily forward from near the tent,\r\nand we could plainly see their alarm and astonishment; but speedily\r\nrecognizing us, they waved joyfully, and came quickly to the landing\r\nplace to meet us.\r\n\r\nBy skillful management we brought the pinnace near a projection of the\r\nbank, and Fritz assisted his mother to come on board, where, breathless\r\nwith haste and excitement, she exclaimed, "You dear, horrid, wonderful\r\npeople, shall I scold you or praise you? You have frightened me out of\r\nmy wits! To see a beautiful little ship come sailing in was startling\r\nenough, for I could not conceive who might be on board, but the report\r\nof your guns made me tremble with fear--and had I not recognized your\r\nvoices directly after, I should have run away with Franz--Heaven knows\r\nwhere! But have you really done all this work yourselves?" she\r\ncontinued, when we had been forgiven for terrifying her with our\r\nvainglorious salute. "What a charming little yacht! I should not be\r\nafraid to sail in this myself."\r\n\r\nAfter the pinnace had been shown off, and received the admiration she\r\ndeserved, while our industry, skill, and perseverance met with\r\nboundless praise: "Now," said my wife, "you must come with me, and see\r\nhow little Franz and I have improved our time every day of your\r\nabsence."\r\n\r\nWe all landed, and with great curiosity followed the mother up the river\r\ntoward the cascade; where, to our astonishment, we found a garden neatly\r\nlaid out in beds and walks; and she continued, "We don\'t frighten people\r\nby firing salutes in honor of our performances; although, by and by, I\r\ntoo shall want fire in a peaceable form. Look at my beds of lettuce and\r\ncabbages, my rows of beans and peas! Think what delicious dinners I\r\nshall be able to cook for you, and give me credit for my diligence."\r\n\r\n"My dear wife!" I exclaimed, "this is beautiful! You have done wonders!\r\nDid you not find the work too hard?"\r\n\r\n"The ground is light and easy to dig hereabouts," she replied. "I have\r\nplanted potatoes, and cassava roots; there is space for sugar-cane, and\r\nthe young fruit trees, and I shall want you to contrive to irrigate\r\nthem, by leading water from the cascades in hollow bamboos. Up by the\r\nsheltering rocks I mean to have pine-apples and melons; they will look\r\nsplendid when they are spread there. To shelter the beds of European\r\nvegetables from the heat of the sun, I have planted seeds of maize round\r\nthem. The shadow of the tall plants will afford protection from the\r\nburning rays. Do you think that is a good plan?"\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed; the whole arrangement is capital. Now, as sunset\r\napproaches, we must return to the tent for supper and rest, for both of\r\nwhich we are all quite ready."\r\n\r\nThe time passed in happy talk over our many new interests; every one had\r\nthe pleasant sensation which attends successful labor, as well as\r\nexperiencing the joy of affording unexpected pleasure to others; and I\r\nespecially pointed out to my sons how true, genuine happiness consists\r\nin that, rather than in mere self-gratification.\r\n\r\nNext morning, my wife said: "If you can exist on shore long enough to\r\nvisit Falconhurst, dear husband, I should like you to attend to the\r\nlittle fruit trees. I fear they have been too much neglected. I have\r\nwatered them occasionally, and spread earth over the roots as they lay,\r\nbut I could not manage to plant them."\r\n\r\n"You have done far more than I could have expected, my wife," I replied,\r\n"and provided you do not ask me to give up the sea altogether, I most\r\nwillingly agree to your request, and will go to Falconhurst as soon as\r\nthe raft is unloaded, and everything safely arranged here."\r\n\r\nLife on shore was an agreeable change for us all, and the boys actively\r\nwent to work, so that the stores were quickly brought up to the tent,\r\npiled in order, and carefully covered with sailcloths, fastened down by\r\npegs all round. The pinnace being provided with an anchor, was properly\r\nmoored, and her elegant appearance quite altered the looks of our\r\nharbor, hitherto occupied only by the grotesque tub boat, and flat,\r\nuninteresting raft.\r\n\r\nTaking an ample supply of everything we should require at Falconhurst,\r\nwe were soon comfortably reestablished in that charming abode, its\r\npeaceful shade seeming more delightful than ever, after the heat and\r\nhard work we had lately undergone.\r\n\r\nSeveral Sundays had passed during our stay at Tentholm, and the welcome\r\nDay of Rest now returned again, to be observed with heartfelt devotion\r\nand grateful praise.\r\n\r\nI did not attempt too much in the form of preaching, as I could not have\r\nsecured the attention of my hearers to any long-winded discourse, but\r\nthey were interested in the Bible reading and simple instructions I drew\r\nfrom it, and their young voices joined sweetly in favorite hymns, which\r\nmy wife sang from memory.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I desired the boys to let me see their dexterity in\r\nathletic exercises, such as running, leaping, wrestling, and climbing;\r\ntelling them they must keep up the practice of these things, so as to\r\ngrow strong, active men, powerful to repel and cope with danger, as well\r\nas agile and swift-footed to escape from it. No man can be really\r\ncourageous and self-reliant without an inward consciousness of physical\r\npower and capability.\r\n\r\n"I want to see my sons strong, both morally and physically," said I;\r\n"that means, little Franz," as the large blue eyes looked inquiringly up\r\nat him, "brave to do what is good and right, and to hate evil, and\r\nstrong to work, hunt, and provide for themselves and others, and to\r\nfight if necessary."\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the boys seeming disposed to carry out my wishes\r\nby muscular exercise of all sorts, I encouraged them by saying I meant\r\nto prepare a curious new weapon for them, only they must promise not to\r\nneglect the practice of archery; as to their guns, I had no reason to\r\nfear they would be laid aside.\r\n\r\nTaking a long cord, I attached a leaden bullet to each end and had\r\ninstantly to answer a storm of questions as to what this could possibly\r\nbe for.\r\n\r\n"This is a miniature lasso," said I; "the Mexicans, Patagonians, and\r\nvarious tribes of South America, make use of this weapon in hunting,\r\nwith marvelous dexterity, only, having no bullets, they fasten stones to\r\ntheir ropes, which are immensely longer than this. One end is swung\r\nround and round the mounted hunter\'s head, and then cast with skill and\r\nprecision toward the animal he wishes to strike; immediately drawing it\r\nback, he can repeat the blow, and either kill or wound his prey.\r\nFrequently, however, the intention is to take the animal, wild horse, or\r\nbuffalo, or whatever it may be, alive; and in that case, the lasso is\r\nthrown, while riding in hot pursuit, in such a way as to make the stone\r\ntwist many times round the neck, body, or legs of the fugitive,\r\narresting him even in full career."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, what a splendid contrivance! Will you try it now? There is\r\nthe donkey, father! do catch the donkey."\r\n\r\nNot at all certain of my powers, I declined to practice upon a live\r\nsubject, but consented to make a trial of skill by aiming at the stump\r\nof a tree at no great distance.\r\n\r\nMy success surpassed my own expectations; the stump was entwined by the\r\ncord in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever as to the feasibility\r\nof the wonderful performances I described; and I was assailed by\r\npetitions from the boys, each anxious to possess a lasso of his own\r\nwithout a moment\'s delay.\r\n\r\nAs the manufacture was simple, their wishes were speedily gratified, and\r\nlasso practice became the order of the day.\r\n\r\nFritz, who was the most active and adroit, besides having, of course,\r\nthe greatest muscular strength, soon became skilled in the art.\r\n\r\nThat night a change came over the weather, and early next morning I\r\nperceived that a gale of wind was getting up. From the height of our\r\ntrees I could see that the surface of the sea was in violent agitation.\r\n\r\nIt was with no small satisfaction that I thought of our hard-won\r\npinnace, safely moored in the harbor, and recollected that there was\r\nnothing to call us to the wreck for the next few days.\r\n\r\nMy attention was by no means monopolized by my sons and their\r\namusements. The good mother had much to show me demanding my approval,\r\nadvice, or assistance, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nA good supply of wild pigeons and ortolans had been snared, partly\r\ncooked, and preserved in lard. Of these she showed me her small cask\r\nwell filled.\r\n\r\nThen the nests of various pairs of tame pigeons were exhibited, but her\r\nchief care was the unpromising condition of her dear little fruit trees,\r\nfor, having been forgotten, they were so dry and withered, that unless\r\nplanted without further delay, she feared we should lose them.\r\n\r\nThis needful work we set about, therefore, at once, proposing afterward\r\nan excursion to the Calabash Wood, in order to manufacture a large\r\nsupply of vessels and utensils of all sorts and sizes.\r\n\r\nEvery one was inclined for this expedition; consequently the planting of\r\nthe orchard was carried on with surprising vigor, but was not completed\r\nuntil toward evening; and then all sorts of arrangements were made for\r\nan early start next day. The mother and Franz were to be of the party,\r\nand their equipment took some time, for we meant to make a grand family\r\nexcursion, attended by our domestic pets and servants!\r\n\r\nBy sunrise we were all astir, and everything quickly made ready for a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nThe sledge, loaded with ammunition and baskets of provisions, and drawn\r\nby the donkey, was to be used for carrying home our gourd manufactures,\r\nas well as any other prize we might fall in with.\r\n\r\nTurk, as usual, headed the procession, clad in his coat of mail.\r\n\r\nThen came the boys with their guns and game bags. Their mother and I\r\nfollowed, and behind trotted Juno, not in very good spirits, poor dog!\r\nbecause Master Knips, who had no idea of being left alone, must needs\r\nride on her back.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion I took two guns with me, one loaded with shot for game,\r\nanother with ball for our defense against beasts of prey.\r\n\r\nFlamingo Marsh was quickly crossed, and the magnificent country beyond\r\nlay extended in all its beauty and fertility before our eyes. It was new\r\nto my wife and two of the boys, and the lovely prospect enchanted them.\r\n\r\nHere Fritz and Jack turned aside into the bush, where presently loud\r\nbarking was followed by the quick report of a gun, and a large bird,\r\nwhich had risen from thicket, fell heavily to the ground before us. Far\r\nfrom resigning itself, however, to death or captivity, it sprung to its\r\nfeet, and, unable to fly, rushed away with extraordinary speed, hotly\r\npursued by the excited dog, while Fritz ran, panting, in the same\r\ndirection, and Juno, eager to join the chase, sprang aside so suddenly\r\nthat her rider was flung unceremoniously on the sand, as she darted to\r\nintercept the retreat of the active bird. This she cleverly\r\naccomplished, but its defense was maintained so fiercely, as it struck\r\nout with its powerful legs and sharp claws, that neither Fritz nor the\r\ndogs could master it.\r\n\r\nI hastened to their assistance, and found Juno holding on nobly by the\r\nwing she had seized, while the bird, which proved to be a magnificent\r\nbustard, struggled and fought fiercely. Watching my opportunity, I threw\r\na large handkerchief over it, and with difficulty succeeded in binding\r\nits legs and wings. It was borne in triumph to the rest of our party,\r\nwho meantime had been reclining on the sand.\r\n\r\n"What have you got?" "What has Fritz shot?" cried the boys, starting up\r\nat our approach. "A bustard! oh, that is splendid!"\r\n\r\n"To be sure, it is the one we missed that day, don\'t you remember,\r\nmother? Ah, ha! old fellow, you are done for this time!" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"I think this is a hen bustard; it is the mother bird," said Ernest.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, poor thing!" exclaimed my wife, in a tone of concern; "it is\r\nmost likely the same, and I know she had a brood of young birds, and now\r\nthey will be left unprotected and miserable. Had we not better let her\r\ngo?"\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear, kind-hearted wife, that was weeks and weeks ago! Those\r\nlittle birds are all strong and big by this time, and I dare say Mrs.\r\nBustard here has forgotten all about them. Besides, she is badly\r\nwounded, and we must try to cure the hurt. If we succeed, she will be a\r\nvaluable addition to our poultry yard; if we cannot, you shall roast her\r\nfor dinner."\r\n\r\nResuming our march, we next arrived at the Monkey Grove, which was the\r\nscene of the tragi-comic adventure by which Fritz became the guardian of\r\nthe orphan ape.\r\n\r\nWhile he amused us all by a lively and graphic description of the scene,\r\nErnest was standing apart under a splendid cocoanut palm, gazing in\r\nfixed admiration at the grand height of the stem, and its beautiful,\r\ngraceful crown of leaves. The cluster of nuts beneath these evidently\r\nadded interest to the spectacle, for, drawing quietly near him, I heard\r\na long-drawn sigh, and the words:\r\n\r\n"It\'s awfully high! I wish one would fall down!"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he uttered these words, than, as if by magic, down plumped\r\na huge nut at his feet.\r\n\r\nThe boy was quite startled, and sprang aside, looking timidly upward,\r\nwhen, to my surprise, down came another.\r\n\r\n"Why, this is just like the fairy tale of the wishing-cap!" cried\r\nErnest. "My wish is granted as soon as formed!"\r\n\r\n"I suspect the fairy in this instance is more anxious to pelt us and\r\ndrive us away than to bestow dainty gifts upon us," said I. "I think\r\nthere is most likely a cross-eyed old ape sitting up among those shadowy\r\nleaves and branches."\r\n\r\nWe examined the nuts, thinking they were perhaps old ones, and had\r\nfallen, in consequence, naturally, but they were not even quite ripe.\r\n\r\nAnxious to discover what was in the tree, we all surrounded it, gaping\r\nand gazing upward with curious eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! I see him!" shouted Fritz presently. "Oh, a hideous creature!\r\nwhat can it be? flat, round, as big as a plate, and with a pair of\r\nhorrid claws! Here he comes! He is going to creep down the tree!"\r\n\r\nAt this, little Franz slipped behind his mother, Ernest took a glance\r\nround to mark a place of retreat, Jack raised the butt-end of his gun,\r\nand every eye was fixed on the trunk of the tree, down which a large\r\nland-crab commenced a leisurely descent. As it approached within reach,\r\nJack hit at it boldly, when it suddenly dropped the remaining distance,\r\nand opening its great claws, sidled after him with considerable\r\nrapidity, upon which he fairly turned tail and ran. We all burst into a\r\nroar of laughter, which soon made him face about, and then, to our\r\ninfinite amusement, the little fellow prepared for a fresh onset; laying\r\ndown all he was carrying, pulling off his jacket and spreading it wide\r\nout in both hands, he returned to the charge, suddenly threw his garment\r\nover the creature, wrapped it well round it, and then pummeled it with\r\nall the strength of his fists.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes I could do nothing but laugh, but then running to him\r\nwith my hatchet, I struck several sharp blows on his bundle, which we\r\nopened carefully, and found within the land-crab perfectly dead.\r\n\r\n"Well, this is an ugly rascal!" cried Jack; "if he hadn\'t been so\r\nhideous, I should not have dealt so severely with him. I wasn\'t a bit\r\nafraid. What is the creature\'s name?"\r\n\r\n"This is a crab, a land-crab," said I, "of which there are many\r\nvarieties, and this, I think, is called a cocoanut crab, or at least it\r\ndeserves the name, for it is evidently very fond of eating these nuts,\r\nsince it takes the trouble to climb the trees for them; the difficulty\r\nof getting at the kernel, too, is considerable. You showed no little\r\npresence of mind, Jack, when you thought of catching it in your jacket;\r\nin fact, it might have been more than a match for you otherwise, for\r\nsome are most determined fighters, and are very swift, too. Now let us\r\ntake it, as well as the nuts, to the sledge, and go on our way."\r\n\r\nProgress became difficult, for we were constantly stopped in passing\r\nthrough the wood, by having to cut away the hanging boughs and creeping\r\nplants which interlaced them. Ernest was behind, and by-and-by called me\r\nback to see what proved to be an important discovery; from the several\r\nstalks of one of these creepers flowed clear cold water, and I\r\nrecognized the "liane rouge," which is known in America, and is so\r\nprecious to the thirsty hunter or traveler. This is truly one of God\'s\r\ngood gifts to man!\r\n\r\nThe boys were much delighted with this curious plant. "Only fancy,\r\nmother," said Ernest, as he showed it to her, "how cheering and\r\nrefreshing to find this if one were lost and alone in a vast forest,\r\nwandering for days and days without being near a natural spring of\r\nwater."\r\n\r\n"But are you certain it is safe to drink this?" asked she.\r\n\r\nI assured her it was so, and advised the boys to cut enough to quench\r\nthe thirst of the whole party, including our animals. This they did,\r\nonly finding it necessary, as with the sugar canes, to cut air holes\r\nabove the joints.\r\n\r\nAfter struggling onward for a short time, we emerged from the thickets\r\ninto open ground, and saw the calabash trees in the distance. As we drew\r\nnear, their curious appearance and singular fruit caused much surprise\r\nand also amusement, for we were speedily established among the trees,\r\nwhere, as I chose and cut down the gourds most likely to be useful,\r\nevery one engaged merrily in the work of cutting, carving, sawing, and\r\nscooping some manner of dish, bowl, cup, jar, or platter, according to\r\nhis several taste or ability.\r\n\r\nWe were to dine here, and after a time Fritz and Jack began to prepare a\r\nfireplace, their great ambition being to heat the stones red hot, and\r\ncook the crab in a hollow gourd. Their mother, therefore, left them to\r\ntheir own devices, and attended to the hungry animals, unharnessing the\r\nass to graze, and giving cocoanut milk to the poor little monkey, who\r\nhad been obliged to travel in a covered basket for some time, lest he\r\nshould be lost in the woods. The wounded bustard had been completely\r\nforgotten, and from heat and thirst was suffering greatly until her\r\nfriendly care revived it, and it was tied to a tree and allowed to move\r\nabout, its fierce spirit greatly tamed by adversity.\r\n\r\nThe cooking operations came to a stand soon after the fire was lighted,\r\nfor it appeared that we had no more water in the jars we had brought, so\r\nthe boys proposed to go in search of a spring. I agreed to accompany\r\nthem; Ernest also wished to join us, and as our intention was to\r\nexamine merely the surrounding wood, I saw no objection to leaving their\r\nmother and Franz for a short time.\r\n\r\nVery soon after our exploration began, Ernest, who was in front, turned\r\nwith a face of terror, shouting, "A wild boar! an immense wild boar,\r\nfather! Do come, quick!" And sure enough, I heard a loud snorting and\r\npuffing as some large animal passed hastily through the thick underwood\r\nbeyond us. "After him lads, after him!" cried I, hurrying forward. "Call\r\nthe dogs! stand ready to fire!" And we pressed through the bushes to the\r\nspot where Ernest had seen the creature. The ground was grubbed up, and\r\nsome potatoes lay about, showing that we had disturbed him at his\r\nmidday meal. Ernest and Jack were more disposed to gather the roots\r\nthan to follow up the chase. Fritz and I alone went after the dogs, who\r\neagerly pushed on, and by the sounds we heard had evidently attacked the\r\nboar at no great distance. Terrific barking, snarling, and grunting\r\nguided us to the scene of action, and we beheld our mastiffs one on each\r\nside of a large respectable-looking pig, holding on by the great ears,\r\nwhile the animal, on seeing us, appeared rather to beseech our\r\ninterference than to propose to offer a desperate resistance.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the truth became apparent! The captive grunter was no fierce\r\nnative of the forest, but our own runaway sow! Our excitement had been\r\nwound to so high a pitch that the discovery was quite a shock, and we\r\nfelt half angry with the creature who had disappointed us; then the\r\nabsurdity of the whole thing made us laugh heartily, and calling off the\r\ndogs, the old lady was released from her ignominious position. Our\r\nlaughter resounding through the wood, brought Ernest and Jack from their\r\npotatoes, to see what was going on.\r\n\r\n"Much use you two would have been suppose we had required help," cried\r\nFritz, as they recognized their old friend.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, you see," returned Jack, "Ernest and I had a sort of a kind\r\nof presentiment that this was going to be the old sow. And just look at\r\nour fine potatoes!"\r\n\r\nA good deal of joking on the subject ensued, but was interrupted by\r\nErnest, who drew our attention to fruit resembling apples on the\r\nsurrounding bushes, and on the grass beneath them.\r\n\r\nThe sow was making amends for the fright and pain she had endured by\r\nmunching and crunching this fruit at a great rate. Fritz feared that it\r\nmight be the poisonous manchineel, against which I once warned them, but\r\non examining it, I was induced to pronounce a more favorable opinion,\r\nand we collected a quantity in hopes that, if the monkey approved of it\r\nas well as the old sow, we might be able to enjoy a feast ourselves.\r\n\r\nAll this time not a drop of water had we seen, and our own thirst\r\nincreasing, we felt eager to procure some before returning to our\r\nresting-place.\r\n\r\nJack preceded us, and we made our way toward a high rock, which rose\r\nabove the thickets, when he suddenly startled us by a loud cry of "A\r\ncrocodile! father! father! A crocodile!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, boy! A crocodile, of all things, in this dry, parched forest,\r\nwhere we can\'t get so much as a mouthful of water!"\r\n\r\nOn advancing to where Jack stood, I perceived that his mistake was not\r\nso very silly after all, for I beheld an iguana, one of the largest of\r\nthe lizard species, and a truly formidable-looking fellow. I was glad to\r\nassure Jack that the strange creature he had found was perfectly\r\nharmless, and that its flesh being esteemed a delicacy, it would be a\r\nvaluable prize to carry back with us.\r\n\r\nIn another moment Fritz would have fired, but arresting his hand, "Your\r\nshot," I said, "would probably only wound the animal, and being\r\nextremely tenacious of life, it would certainly escape; we must gain\r\npossession of the sleeping beauty by a gentler method."\r\n\r\n"You are not going to kiss it, are you, father?" asked Jack, with a\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\nI tried to rebuke him for his impertinence, but, failing, I commenced\r\noperations. I first attached a cord and running-noose to a stout stick,\r\nand holding a light switch in my other hand, I began to approach the\r\ncreature with soft, slow steps, while the boys looked on with the utmost\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nPresently I began very softly to whistle a sweet, yet very lively air,\r\nwhich I continued more and more distinctly as I drew near the lizard;\r\nuntil, awaking, it seemed to listen with pleasure--raising its head as\r\nthough better to catch the sounds, or to discover whence they came.\r\n\r\nWhen near enough, I began gently to stroke and tickle him with the wand,\r\ncontinuing to whistle the prettiest tunes I could think of; and the\r\nlizard gave signs of pleasurable contentment, stretching his limbs and\r\nmoving his tail in token of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, availing myself of a movement of his head, I cast the noose\r\nover it, drew the cord tight, and placing my foot on the body, I was\r\nabout to kill it by piercing the nostril--almost the only vulnerable\r\npart in this singular reptile--when Jack received such a blow from its\r\ntail, which was furiously driving in all directions, as sent him rolling\r\nover like a ninepin. At the same time he opened his jaws, when the boys\r\ntook fright at the row of sharp teeth, and thinking that the sooner he\r\nwas dead the better, were for battering him with sticks; but I assuring\r\nthem my method would kill him more quickly and without pain, thrust my\r\nrod into his nostril, on which the blood flowed and the lizard soon\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nThe boys seemed to think me as wonderful a person as a snake charmer,\r\nand the success of my stratagem, as well as of the means by which the\r\nlizard was slain, called forth great admiration, since they had never\r\nheard of the animal, nor of the method of capturing it so commonly\r\npractised in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nNow came the question of how we were to carry this unwieldy burden. I\r\nhad a great dislike to killing any creature and leaving it useless\r\nbehind me; so, without more ado, I fairly took it on my back, and\r\nmarched off with it.\r\n\r\nAs we came toward the Calabash Wood, we could hear the voices of the\r\ndeserted mother and child calling us in anxious tones; for indeed our\r\nprotracted absence alarmed them. We shouted joyously in reply, and our\r\nappearance, as we issued from the woods, afforded them welcome relief\r\nfrom their fears, although the dreadful creature on my back startled\r\nthem not a little.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to tell, so much to be seen, that for a time hunger\r\nand thirst were forgotten; and no one thought even of the water we had\r\nvainly gone in search of, until Master Knips, having slyly possessed\r\nhimself of some of our new-found apples, was discovered munching away\r\nand enjoying them amazingly--which instantly gave the boys a strong wish\r\nto eat some also; and as the bustard likewise pecked at them without\r\nhesitation, I felt sure there could be no danger; and on tasting them, I\r\nconcluded it was the fruit of the guava, a West Indian plant, which we\r\nwere delighted to have.\r\n\r\nAlthough refreshing, this fruit rather sharpened than appeased our\r\nappetites, and we were glad to eat the provisions we had brought from\r\nhome, without waiting to cook anything, as we had originally intended.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, high time to move homeward, and we thought it best not\r\nto encumber ourselves with the sledge and the greater part of its load,\r\nbut to leave it until the next day. The ass was laden with the iguana\r\nand the bustard; and little Franz, tired as he was, looked in vain for a\r\nspare seat on its back.\r\n\r\nOur road home lay through a majestic forest of oak trees, beneath which\r\nlay numberless acorns, some of which we gathered as we went along; and\r\nat length, before night closed in, we all reached Falconhurst in safety.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was ready, we were thankful to recruit our exhausted\r\nstrength by eating heartily of a piece of broiled iguana, with potatoes\r\nand roast acorns, which tasted like excellent chestnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n Fritz and I return to the Calabash Wood--Fritz shoots a ruffed\r\n     grouse--We come across waxberry bushes--Sociable grosbeaks--Fritz\r\n     captures a parrot--A lecture on ants--Caoutchouc trees--The\r\n     sago-palm and the edible worms--Return with sugar-canes to\r\n     Falconhurst--Candle-making--How to make butter without a\r\n     churn--Plant trees and adorn Tentholm--Last visit to the\r\n     wreck--The first ducklings on the island--Falconhurst again--An\r\n     excursion--We pitch our tent--Fritz and Jack ascend the cocoanut\r\n     trees--Ernest brings us a delicacy--Loss of Grizzle--Jack and I go\r\n     in pursuit--Giant bamboos--Encounter with buffaloes--The buffalo\r\n     calf--Find a jackal\'s lair--Reach our camp--What happened in our\r\n     absence--Fritz\'s pet--Sago manufacture--Meet with our sow and her\r\n     family again--How Ernest tamed the eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done on the following day was to return to the\r\nCalabash Wood, to fetch the sledge with the dishes, bowls, and baskets\r\nwe had made.\r\n\r\nFritz alone accompanied me. I desired the other boys to remain with\r\ntheir mother, intending to explore beyond the chain of rocky hills, and\r\nthinking a large party undesirable on the occasion.\r\n\r\nPassing through the wood of evergreen oaks, we observed our sow feasting\r\non the acorns, evidently not a whit the worse for the fright we had\r\ngiven her the previous day--in fact, she appeared more friendly disposed\r\ntoward us than usual, possibly considering us as her deliverers from the\r\njaws of the savage dogs.\r\n\r\nMany birds tenanted this grove, and were undisturbed by our movements,\r\nuntil Fritz fired and shot a beautiful bluejay and a couple of\r\nparroquets, one a brilliant scarlet, the other green and gold.\r\n\r\nFritz was in the act of reloading his gun, when an unaccountable noise\r\nstruck our ears, and put us instantly on the alert, because it appeared\r\nlike the dull thumping sound of a muffled drum, and reminded us of the\r\npossible presence of savages.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest caution we drew near the sound, concealing ourselves\r\namong the low bushes and thick grass and creepers, until we reached an\r\nopen glade; where, standing on an old prostrate log, was a beautiful\r\nbird, about the size of a cock, of a rich chestnut brown color, finely\r\nmottled with dark brown and gray. On the shoulders were curious tufts of\r\nvelvety black feathers, glossed with green. He was ruffling his wings,\r\nerecting his tail and neck feathers, strutting and wheeling about in a\r\nmost strange and stately fashion. After maneuvering for some time in\r\nthis manner, greatly to the edification of a party of birds resembling\r\nhim, but without any ruff, who, assembled round the stump, were enjoying\r\nhis performances, he spread out his tail like a fan, stiffened his\r\nwings, and began to strike with them in short, rapid beats, faster and\r\nfaster, until a rumbling sound like very distant thunder was produced,\r\nand the whirring wings enveloped him as in a cloud. This was the\r\ndrumming noise which had alarmed us, increased, as I imagine, by the\r\nwing strokes falling at times on the decayed and hollow stump on which\r\nthe curious pantomime was acted.\r\n\r\nI was watching it with the utmost interest, when a shot from behind me\r\nwas fired, and in a moment the play was at an end; my over-hasty son had\r\nchanged the pretty comedy into a sad and needless tragedy. The\r\nenthusiastic drummer fell dead from his perch, and the crowd of admiring\r\ncompanions fled in dismay.\r\n\r\nThe cruel interruption of a scene so rare and remarkable annoyed me\r\nextremely, and I blamed Fritz for firing without my leave. I felt sure\r\nthe bird was the ruffed grouse, and a very fine specimen. We placed it\r\non the ass, which was patiently awaiting our return, and went on our\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe sledge was quite safe where we had left it; it was early in the\r\nday, and I resolved to explore, as I had intended, a line of cliff and\r\nrocky hills, which, at more or less distance from the seashore, extended\r\nthe whole length of coast known or visible to us.\r\n\r\nI desired to discover an opening, if any existed, by which to penetrate\r\nthe interior of the country, or to ascertain positively that we were\r\nwalled in and isolated on this portion of the coast.\r\n\r\nLeaving Calabash Wood behind us, we advanced over ground covered with\r\nmanioc, potatoes, and many plants unknown to us; pleasant streamlets\r\nwatered the fruitful soil, and the view on all sides was open and\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nSome bushes attracted my notice, loaded with small white berries, of\r\npeculiar appearance like wax, and very sticky when plucked. I recognized\r\nin this a plant called by botanists _Myrica cerifera_, and with much\r\npleasure explained to Fritz that, by melting and straining these\r\nberries, we might easily succeed in making candles, and afford very\r\ngreat satisfaction to the mother, who did not at all approve of having\r\nto lay her work aside and retire to rest the moment the sun set. The\r\ngreenish wax to be obtained would be more brittle than beeswax, but it\r\nwould burn very fairly, and diffuse an agreeable perfume. Having the ass\r\nwith us, we lost no time in gathering berries enough to fill one of the\r\nlarge canvas bags he carried, and we then continued our route.\r\n\r\nVery soon we met with another natural curiosity, the curious appearance\r\nof which surprised us much. This was the abode, under one roof, of a\r\nwhole colony of birds, about the size of yellow hammers, but of plain\r\nbrown plumage. The nests were built in a mass round the stem and among\r\nthe branches of a tree standing alone, and a kind of roof formed of\r\ngrass, straws, and fibers covered them all, and sheltered the community\r\nfrom rain and the heat of the sun. There were numbers of openings into\r\nthe irregular sides of the group of dwellings, the nests resembling\r\ndifferent apartments in a house common to all; twigs and small branches\r\nemerged here and there from the walls, and served as perches for the\r\nyoung birds, and resting-places and posts of observation for all. The\r\ngeneral appearance of the establishment reminded us of a huge\r\nbath-sponge. The feathered inhabitants swarmed in and out by thousands,\r\nand we saw among them many beautiful little parrots, who seemed in many\r\ninstances to contest possession of the nest with the lawful owners.\r\n\r\nFritz, being an expert climber and exceedingly anxious to examine the\r\nnests more closely, ascended the tree, hoping to obtain one or two young\r\nbirds, if any were hatched. He put his hand into several holes, which\r\nwere empty; but at last his intended theft and robbery met with repulse\r\nand chastisement he little expected; for, reaching far back into the\r\nnest, his finger was seized and sharply bitten by a very strong beak, so\r\nthat with a cry he withdrew his hand, and shook it vigorously to lessen\r\nthe pain. Recovering from the surprise, he again and more resolutely\r\nseized the unkind bird, and, despite its shrieks and screams, drew it\r\nfrom its retreat, crammed it into his pocket, buttoned up his coat, and\r\nslid quickly to the ground, pursued by numbers of the captive\'s\r\nrelations, who darted from the other holes and flew round the robber,\r\nscreeching and pecking at him in a rage.\r\n\r\nFritz\'s prize was not one of the real owners of the nests, which were\r\nthose of the sociable grosbeak, but a very pretty small green parrot,\r\nwith which he was greatly pleased, and which he at once determined to\r\ntame and teach to speak; for the present it was carefully remanded to\r\nprison in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThis curious colony of birds afforded us matter for conversation as we\r\nwent on our way; their cheerful, sociable habits, and the instinct which\r\nprompted them to unite in labor for the common good, appearing most\r\nwonderful to us.\r\n\r\n"Examples of the kind, however," said I, "are numerous, in various\r\nclasses of animals. Beavers, for instance, build and live together in a\r\nvery remarkable way. Among insects, bees, wasps, and ants are well known\r\nas social architects; in like manner, the coral insect works wonders\r\nbeneath the ocean waves, by force of perseverance and united effort."\r\n\r\n"I have often watched ants at work," said Fritz; "it is most amusing to\r\nsee how they carry on the various works and duties of their\r\ncommonwealth."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever noticed how much trouble they take with the eggs?"\r\ninquired I, to see how far he understood the process; "carrying them\r\nabout in the warmth of the sun until they are hatched?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! that is rather the chrysalis of the antworm, or larva which is\r\nproduced from an egg. I know they are called ants\' eggs, but, strictly\r\nspeaking, that is incorrect."\r\n\r\n"You are perfectly right, my boy. Well, if you have taken so much\r\ninterest in watching the little ants of your native country, how\r\ndelighted and astonished you would be to see the wonders performed by\r\nthe vast tribes of large ants in foreign lands.\r\n\r\n"Some of these build heaps or nests, four or six feet high and\r\nproportionately broad, which are so strong and firm that they defy\r\nequally sunshine and rain. They are, within, divided into regular\r\nstreets, galleries, vaults, and nurseries. So firmly are these mounds\r\nbuilt, that with interior alterations, a deserted one might be used for\r\na baking-oven.\r\n\r\n"The ant, although respected since the days of King Solomon as a model\r\nof industry, is not in itself an attractive insect.\r\n\r\n"It exudes a sticky moisture, its smell is unpleasant, and it destroys\r\nand devours whatever eatable comes in its way. Although, in our own\r\ncountry it does little harm, the large ants of foreign lands are most\r\ndestructive and troublesome; it being very difficult to check their\r\ndepredations. Fortunately they have enemies by whose exertions their\r\nnumbers are kept down; birds, other insects, and even four-footed beasts\r\nprey upon them. Chief among the latter is the ant-bear, or tamanoir, of\r\nSouth America, a large creature six or seven feet in length, covered\r\nwith long coarse hair, drooping like a heavy plume over the hind\r\nquarters. The head is wonderfully elongated and very narrow; it is\r\ndestitute of teeth, and the tongue resembles somewhat a great red\r\nearth-worm. It has immensely strong curved claws, with which it tears\r\nand breaks down and scratches to pieces the hard walls of the ant-heaps;\r\nthen, protruding its sticky tongue, it coils and twists it about among\r\nthe terrified millions disturbed by its attack; they adhere to this\r\nhorrible invader, and are drawn irresistibly backward into the hungry,\r\ntoothless jaws awaiting them.\r\n\r\n"The little ant-eater is not more than about twenty-one inches in\r\nlength, has a shorter and more natural looking head, and fine silky fur.\r\nIt usually lives in trees."\r\n\r\nI was pleased to find my memory served me so well on this subject, as it\r\ninterested my boy amazingly; and occupied us for a considerable time\r\nwhile we traveled onward.\r\n\r\nArriving presently at a grove of tall trees, with very strong, broad\r\nthick leaves, we paused to examine them; they bore a round, fig-like\r\nfruit, full of little seeds and of a sour, harsh taste.\r\n\r\nFritz saw some gummy resin exuding from cracks in the bark, and it\r\nreminded him of the boyish delight afforded by collecting gum from\r\ncherry-trees at home, so that he must needs stop to scrape off as much\r\nas he could. He rejoined me presently, attempting to soften what he had\r\ncollected in his hands; but finding it would not work like gum, he was\r\nabout to fling it away, when he suddenly found that he could stretch it\r\nand that it sprang back to its original size.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, only look! this gum is quite elastic! Can it possibly be\r\nindia-rubber?"\r\n\r\n"What!" cried I; "let me see it! a valuable discovery that would be,\r\nindeed; and I do believe you are perfectly right!"\r\n\r\n"Why would it be so very valuable, father?" inquired Fritz. "I have\r\nonly seen it used for rubbing out pencil marks."\r\n\r\n"India-rubber," I replied, "or, more properly, caoutchouc, is a milky,\r\nresinous juice which flows from certain trees in considerable quantities\r\nwhen the stem is purposely tapped. These trees are indigenous to the\r\nSouth American countries of Brazil, Guiana, and Cayenne. The natives,\r\nwho first obtained it, used to form bottles by smearing earthen flasks\r\nwith repeated coatings of the gum when just fresh from the trees, and\r\nwhen hardened and sufficiently thick, they broke the mold, shook out the\r\nfragments, and hung the bottles in the smoke, when they became firmer\r\nand of a dark color. While moist, the savages were in the habit of\r\ndrawing rude figures and lines on the resin by way of ornament; these\r\nmarks you may have observed, for the bottles obtained from the natives\r\nby the Spaniards and Portuguese have for years been brought to Europe,\r\nand cut into portions to be sold for use in drawing. Caoutchouc can be\r\nput to many uses, and I am delighted to have it here, as we shall, I\r\nhope, be able to make it into different forms; first and foremost, I\r\nshall try to manufacture boots and shoes."\r\n\r\nSoon after making this discovery, we reached the cocoanut wood, and saw\r\nthe bay extending before us, and the great promontory we called Cape\r\nDisappointment, which hitherto had always bounded our excursions.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the wood, I remarked a smaller sort of palm, which,\r\namong its grand companions, I had not previously noticed. One of these\r\nhad been broken by the wind, and I saw that the pith had a peculiar\r\nmealy appearance, and I felt convinced that this was the world-renowned\r\nsago-palm.\r\n\r\nIn the pith I saw some fat worms or maggots, and suddenly recollected\r\nthat I had heard of them before as feeding on the sago, and that in the\r\nWest Indies they are eaten as a delicacy.\r\n\r\nI felt inclined to try what they tasted like; so at once kindling a\r\nfire, and placing some half-dozen, sprinkled with salt, on a little\r\nwooden spit, I set them to roast.\r\n\r\nVery soon rich fat began to drop from them, and they smelt so temptingly\r\ngood that all repugnance to the idea of eating worms vanished; and,\r\nputting one like a pat of butter on a baked potato, I boldly swallowed\r\nit and liked it so much that several others followed in the same way.\r\nFritz also summoned courage to partake of this novel food, which was a\r\nsavory addition to our dinner of baked potatoes.\r\n\r\nBeing once more ready to start, we found so dense a thicket in the\r\ndirect route that we turned aside without attempting to penetrate it,\r\nand made our way toward the sugar brake near Cape Disappointment. This\r\nwe could not pass without cutting a handsome bundle of sugar-canes, and\r\nthe donkey carried that, in addition to the bag of wax berries.\r\n\r\nIn time we reached the sledge in Calabash Wood: the ass was unloaded,\r\neverything placed on the sledge, and our patient beast began calmly and\r\nreadily to drag the burden he had hitherto borne on his back.\r\n\r\nNo further adventure befell us, and we arrived in the evening at\r\nFalconhurst, where our welcome was as warm as usual--all we had to tell\r\nlistened to with the greatest interest, all we had to show most eagerly\r\nexamined, the pretty green parroquet enchanting the boys most\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\nAn excellent supper was ready for us, and with thankful hearts we\r\nenjoyed it together; then, ascending to our tree-castle, and drawing up\r\nthe ladder after us, we betook ourselves to the repose well earned and\r\ngreatly needed after this fatiguing day.\r\n\r\nThe idea of candle-making seemed to have taken the fancy of all the\r\nboys; and next morning they woke, one after the other, with the word\r\ncandle on their lips. When they were thoroughly roused they continued to\r\ntalk candles; all breakfast-time, candles were the subject of\r\nconversation; and after breakfast they would hear of nothing else but\r\nsetting to work at once and making candles.\r\n\r\n"So be it," said I; "let us become chandlers."\r\n\r\nI spoke confidently, but to tell the truth, I had in my own mind certain\r\nmisgivings as to the result of our experiment. In the first place, I\r\nknew that we lacked a very important ingredient--animal fat, which is\r\nnecessary to make candles burn for any length of time with brilliancy.\r\nBesides this, I rather doubted how far my memory would recall the\r\nvarious operations necessary in the manufacture. Of all this, however, I\r\nsaid nothing; and the boys, under my direction, were soon at work. We\r\nfirst picked off the berries and threw them into a large shallow iron\r\nvessel placed on the fire. The green, sweet-scented wax was rapidly\r\nmelted, rising to the surface of the juice yielded by the berries. This\r\nwe skimmed off and placed in a separate pot by the fire, ready for use;\r\nrepeating the operation several times, until we had collected sufficient\r\nliquid wax for our purpose. I then took the wicks my wife had prepared,\r\nand dipped them one after the other into the wax, handing them as I did\r\nso to Fritz, who hung them up on a bush to dry. The coating they thus\r\nobtained was not very thick; but, by repeating the operation several\r\ntimes, they at length assumed very fair proportions, and became real\r\nsturdy candles. Our wax being at an end, we hung these in a cool, shady\r\nplace to harden; and that same night we sat up like civilized beings\r\nthree whole hours after sunset, and Falconhurst was for the first time\r\nbrilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nWe were all delighted with the success of our experiment.\r\n\r\n"You are indeed clever," said my wife; "I only wish that with your\r\ningenuity you would show me how to make butter. Day after day I have the\r\nannoyance of seeing a large supply of good cream go bad under my very\r\neyes, simply because I have no use to which to put it. Invent a plan,\r\nplease do."\r\n\r\n"I think that perhaps I can help you," I replied, after a little\r\nconsideration; "not that I can claim the honor of the invention of my\r\nplan; that is due to the Hottentots. I will see what I can do. Jack,\r\nbring me one of our gourd bottles."\r\n\r\nI took the gourd, one of those I had previously prepared, with a small\r\nhole at one end and well hollowed out and cleaned; this I partially\r\nfilled with cream and then corked up the hole tightly.\r\n\r\n"Here, boys," said I, "you can continue the operation, while I turn\r\ncarpenter and make a cart to take the place of our sledge."\r\n\r\nI gave them their directions, and then set about my own work. They fixed\r\nfour posts in the ground, and to them fastened a square piece of\r\nsailcloth by four cords attached to the corners. In this cradle they\r\nplaced the gourd of cream, and each taking a side rolled it backward and\r\nforward continuously for half an hour.\r\n\r\n"Now," I cried, looking up from my work, "open the gourd and take the\r\ncontents to your mother, with my compliments."\r\n\r\nThey did so; and my good wife\'s eyes were delighted with the sight of a\r\nlarge lump of capital fresh butter.\r\n\r\nWith my son\'s assistance the cart was in time completed; a clumsy\r\nvehicle it was, but strong enough for any purpose to which we might put\r\nit, and, as it proved, of immense use to us in collecting the harvest.\r\n\r\nWe then turned our attention to our fruit-trees, which we had planted in\r\na plot ready for transplanting. The walnut, cherry, and chestnut trees\r\nwe arranged in parallel rows, so as to form a shady avenue from\r\nFalconhurst to Family-bridge; and between them we laid down a tolerable\r\nroad, that we might have no difficulty in reaching Tentholm, be the\r\nweather bad as it might. We planted the vines round the arched roots of\r\nour great mangrove, and the rest of the trees in suitable spots; some\r\nnear Falconhurst, and others away over Jackal River, to adorn Tentholm.\r\nTentholm had been the subject of serious thoughts to me for some time\r\npast, and I now turned all my attention thither. It was not my ambition\r\nto make it beautiful, but to form of it a safe place of refuge in a case\r\nof emergency. My first care, therefore, was to plant a thick, prickly\r\nhedge capable of protecting us from any wild animal, and forming a\r\ntolerable obstacle to the attack of even savages, should they appear.\r\nNot satisfied with this, however, we fortified the bridge, and on a\r\ncouple of hillocks mounted two guns which we brought from the wreck, and\r\nwith whose angry mouths we might bark defiance at any enemy, man or\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nSix weeks slipped away while we were thus busily occupied, six weeks of\r\nhard, yet pleasant, labor. We greeted each Sunday and its accompanying\r\nrest most gratefully, and on that day always, especially thanked God for\r\nour continued health and safety. I soon saw that this hard work was\r\ndeveloping in the boys remarkable strength, and this I encouraged by\r\nmaking them practise running, leaping, climbing, and swimming; I also\r\nsaw, however, that it was having a less satisfactory effect upon their\r\nclothes, which, though a short time before remarkably neat, were now, in\r\nspite of the busy mother\'s mending and patching, most untidy and\r\ndisreputable. I determined, therefore, to pay another visit to the\r\nwreck, to replenish our wardrobe and to see how much longer the vessel\r\nwas likely to hold together. Three of the boys and I went off in the\r\npinnace. The old ship seemed in much the same condition as when we had\r\nleft her; a few more planks had gone, but that was all.\r\n\r\n"Come, boys," cried I, "not an article of the slightest value must be\r\nleft on board; rummage her out to the very bottom of her hold."\r\n\r\nThey took me at my word: sailors\' chests, bales of cloth and linen, a\r\ncouple of small guns, ball and shot, tables, benches, window shutters,\r\nbolts and locks, barrels of pitch, all were soon in a heap on the deck.\r\nWe loaded the pinnace and went on shore. We soon returned with our\r\ntub-boat in tow, and after a few more trips nothing was left on board.\r\n\r\n"One more trip," said I to my wife, before we started again, "and there\r\nwill be the end of the brave ship which carried us from Switzerland. I\r\nhave left two barrels of gunpowder on board and mean to blow her up."\r\n\r\nBefore we lighted the fusee, I discovered a large copper cauldron which\r\nI thought I might save. I made fast to it a couple of empty casks, that\r\nwhen the ship went up it might float. The barrels were placed, the train\r\nlighted, and we returned on shore.\r\n\r\nThe supper was laid outside the tent, at a spot from whence we might\r\nobtain a good view of the wreck. Darkness came on. Suddenly a vivid\r\npillar of fire rose from the black waters, a sullen roar boomed across\r\nthe sea, and we knew that our good old ship was no more.\r\n\r\nWe had planned the destruction of the vessel; we knew that it was for\r\nthe best; and yet that night we went to bed with a feeling of sadness in\r\nour hearts, as though we had lost a dear old friend.\r\n\r\nNext morning all our sadness was dispelled, and it was with pleasure\r\nthat we saw the shore lined with a rich store of planks and beams, the\r\nremnants of the wreck. I soon found, too, the copper cauldron which was\r\nsuccessfully floated by the casks; this I got on shore, and hauling it\r\nup among the rocks, stored under it the powder casks we had landed the\r\nday before. Collecting all these valuables gave us some little trouble,\r\nand while we were thus engaged my wife brought us good news. She had\r\ndiscovered that two ducks and a goose had each reared a large family\r\namong the reeds by the river; and they presently appeared waddling past\r\nus, apparently vastly well-pleased with their performance. We greeted\r\nthem joyfully.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" cried Ernest, "we\'ll be able to afford duck and green peas\r\nsome day soon, and imagine we\'re once more civilized mortals."\r\n\r\nThe sight of these birds reminded me of our family at Falconhurst, and I\r\nannounced my intention of paying them a visit.\r\n\r\nEvery one was delighted and every one would come with me. As we\r\napproached Falconhurst I noticed that several young trees in our avenue\r\nwere considerably bent by the wind, and this resolved me to make an\r\nexpedition next day to cut bamboos for their support. As Fritz was the\r\nonly one besides myself who had visited Cape Disappointment and the\r\nsurrounding country, my wife and the younger boys begged hard to be\r\nallowed to accompany me. I consented; and next morning we started,\r\nbringing with us the cart, drawn by the cow and ass, and laden with\r\neverything necessary for an expedition of several days--a tent,\r\nprovisions, a large supply of ammunitions, and all sorts of implements\r\nand utensils; for I intended to make a great collection of fruits and\r\nthe produce of different trees. It was a lovely morning, and passing\r\ngayly through the plantations of potatoes, manioc, and cassavas, we came\r\nto the nests of the sociable grosbeak, the sight of which charmed the\r\nchildren immensely.\r\n\r\nWe reached the wax trees, and there I called a halt, for I wished to\r\ngather a sack or two of the berries that we might renew our stock of\r\ncandles. The berries were soon plucked; and I stored them away among the\r\nbushes, marking the spot that we might find them on our return.\r\n\r\n"Now for the caoutchouc tree," said I; "now for the waterproof boots and\r\nleggings to keep your feet dry, Ernest." To the caoutchouc tree we\r\ndirected our steps, and were soon busily engaged in stabbing the bark\r\nand placing vessels beneath to catch the sap. We again moved forward;\r\nand, crossing the palm wood, entered upon a delightful plain bounded on\r\none side by an extensive field of waving sugar-cane, on the other by a\r\nthicket of bamboos and lovely palms, while in front stretched the\r\nshining sea, calm and noiseless.\r\n\r\n"How beautiful!" exclaimed Jack, "let us pitch our tent here and stay\r\nhere always instead of living at Falconhurst. It would be jolly."\r\n\r\n"Very likely," replied I, "and so would be the attacks of wild beasts;\r\nimagine a great tiger lying in wait in the thicket yonder, and pouncing\r\nout on us at night. No, no, thank you, I much prefer our nest in the\r\ntree, or our impregnable position at Tentholm. We must make this our\r\nheadquarters for the present, however; for, though perhaps dangerous, it\r\nis the most convenient spot we shall find. Call a halt and pitch the\r\ntent."\r\n\r\nOur beasts were quickly unyoked, the tent arranged, a large fire lit,\r\nsupper started, and we dispersed in various directions, some to cut\r\nbamboos, and some to collect sugar-cane. We then returned; and, as\r\nsupper was still not ready and the boys were hungry, they decided to\r\nobtain some cocoanuts. This time, however, no assistance was to be had\r\nfrom either monkeys or land-crabs, and they gazed up with longing eyes\r\nat the fruit above them.\r\n\r\n"We can climb," said Fritz, "up with you, boys."\r\n\r\nJack and he each rushed at one of the smooth, slippery trunks; right\r\nvigorously they struggled upward, but to no purpose; before they had\r\naccomplished one-quarter of the distance they found themselves slipping\r\nrapidly to the ground.\r\n\r\n"Here, you young athletes," cried I, "I foresaw this difficulty, and\r\nhave provided for it." So saying I held up buskins of shark\'s skin which\r\nI had previously prepared, and which I now bound on to their legs. Thus\r\nequipped they again attempted the ascent, and with a loop of rope passed\r\nround their body and the trunk of the tree, quickly reached the summit.\r\nMy wife joined me, and together we watched the boys as they ascended\r\ntree after tree, throwing down the best fruit from each.\r\n\r\nThey then returned and jestingly begged Ernest to produce the result of\r\nhis labor. The professor had been lying on the grass grazing at the\r\npalms; but, on this sarcastic remark, he sprang to his feet.\r\n"Willingly," he exclaimed, and seizing a pair of buskins, he quickly\r\ndonned them. "Give me a cocoanut shell," said he. I gave him one, and he\r\nput it in his pocket. He ran to a tree, and, with an agility which\r\nsurprised us all, quickly reached the top. No sooner had he done so than\r\nFritz and Jack burst into a roar of laughter. He had swarmed a tree\r\nwhich bore no nuts. Ernest apparently heard them; for, as it seemed in a\r\nfit of anger, he drew his knife and severed the leafy crest, which fell\r\nto the ground. I glanced up at him, surprised at such a display of\r\ntemper. But a bright smile greeted me, and in a merry tone he shouted:\r\n\r\n"Jack, pick that palm-cabbage up and take it to your father; that is\r\nonly half my contribution, and it is worth all your nuts put together."\r\n\r\nHe spoke truly; the cabbage palm is rare, and the tuft of leaves at its\r\nsummit is greatly prized by the South Americans for its great delicacy\r\nand highly nutritive qualities.\r\n\r\n"Bravo!" I cried, "you have retrieved your character; come down and\r\nreceive the thanks of the company. What are you waiting up there for?"\r\n\r\n"I am coming presently," he replied, "with the second half of my\r\ncontribution; I hope it will be as fully appreciated as the first."\r\n\r\nIn a short time he slipped down the tree, and, advancing to his mother,\r\npresented her with the nutshell he had taken up with him.\r\n\r\n"Here," he said, "is a wine which the greatest connoisseur would prize.\r\nTaste it, mother."\r\n\r\nThe shell was filled with a clear, rosy liquor, bright and sparkling. My\r\nwife tasted it. "Excellent, excellent," she exclaimed. "Your very good\r\nhealth, my dear boy!"\r\n\r\nWe drank the rosy wine in turn, and Ernest received hearty thanks from\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late, and while we were enjoying our supper before our\r\ntent, our donkey, who had been quietly browsing near us, suddenly set up\r\na loud bray, and, without the least apparent cause, pricked up his ears,\r\nthrew up his heels, and galloped off into the thicket of bamboos. We\r\nfollowed for a short distance, and I sent the dogs in chase, but they\r\nreturned without our friend, and, as it was late, we were obliged to\r\nabandon the chase.\r\n\r\nI was annoyed by this incident, and even alarmed; for not only had we\r\nlost the ass, but I knew not what had occasioned his sudden flight. I\r\nknew not whether he was aware, by instinct, of the approach of some\r\nfierce wild beast. I said nothing of this to my family, but, making up\r\nan unusually large fire, I bade them sleep with their arms by their\r\nsides, and we all lay down.\r\n\r\nA bright morning awoke us early, and I rose and looked out, thinking\r\nthat perhaps our poor donkey might have been attracted by the light of\r\nthe fires, and had returned. Alas! not a sign of him was to be seen. As\r\nwe could not afford to lose so valuable a beast, I determined to leave\r\nno attempt untried to regain him. We hurriedly breakfasted, and, as I\r\nrequired the dogs to assist me in the search, I left my elder sons to\r\nprotect their mother, and bade Jack get ready for a day\'s march. This\r\narrangement delighted him, and we quickly set out.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or more we trudged onward, directed by the print of the\r\nass\'s hoofs. Sometimes we lost the track for a while, and then again\r\ndiscovered it as we reached softer soil. Finally this guide failed us\r\naltogether, for the donkey seemed to have joined in with a herd of some\r\nlarger animals, with whose hoof-prints his had mingled. I now almost\r\nturned back in despair, but Jack urged me to continue the search; "For,"\r\nsaid he, "if we once get upon a hill we shall see such a large herd, as\r\nthis must be, at almost any distance. Do let us go on, father."\r\n\r\nI consented, and we again pushed forward, through bushes, and over\r\ntorrents, sometimes cutting our way with an ax, and sometimes plunging\r\nknee-deep through a swamp. We at length reached the border of a wide\r\nplain, and on it, in the distance, I could see a herd of animals\r\nbrowsing on the rich grass. It struck me that it might be the very herd\r\nto which our good donkey had joined himself; and, wishing to ascertain\r\nwhether this was so, I resolved to make a detour through a bamboo marsh,\r\nand get as near as possible to the animals without disturbing them. The\r\nbamboos were huge, many of them over thirty feet in height; and, as we\r\nmade our way through them, I remembered an account of the giant cane of\r\nSouth America, which is greatly prized by the Indians on account of its\r\nextreme usefulness; the reeds themselves make masts for their canoes,\r\nwhile each joint will form a cask or box. I was delighted, for I had\r\nlittle doubt that the bamboos we were among were of the same species. I\r\nexplained this to Jack, and as we discussed the possibility of cutting\r\none down and carrying a portion of it home, we reached the border of the\r\nmarsh, and emerged upon the plain. There we suddenly found ourselves\r\nface to face with the herd which we sought--a herd of buffaloes. They\r\nlooked up and stared at us inquisitively, but without moving. Jack would\r\nhave fired, but I checked him. "Back to the thicket," I said, "and keep\r\nback the dogs!"\r\n\r\nWe began to retreat, but before we were again under cover the dogs\r\njoined us; and, in spite of our shouts and efforts to restrain them,\r\nthey dashed forward and seized a buffalo calf. This was a signal to the\r\nwhole herd to attack us. They bellowed loudly, pawed the ground, and\r\ntore it up with their horns, and then dashed madly toward us. We had not\r\ntime to step behind a rock before the leader was upon us. So close was\r\nhe that my gun was useless. I drew a pistol and fired. He fell dead at\r\nmy feet. His fall checked the advance of the rest. They halted, snuffed\r\nthe air, turned tail, and galloped off across the plain. They were gone,\r\nbut the dogs still held gallantly to the calf. They dragged and tussled\r\nwith him, but with their utmost efforts they could not bring him to the\r\nground. How to assist them without shooting the poor beast I knew not;\r\nand this I was unwilling to do, for I hoped that, if we could but\r\ncapture him alive, we might in time manage to tame him, and use him as a\r\nbeast of burden. Jack\'s clever little head, however, suddenly devised a\r\nplan for their aid, and with his usual promptitude, he at once put it\r\ninto execution. He unwound the lasso, which was coiled round his body,\r\nand, as the young bull flung up his heels, he cast, it and caught him by\r\nhis hind legs. The noose drew tight, and in a twinkling the beast was\r\nupon the ground. We fastened the other end of the cord round a stout\r\nbamboo, called off the dogs, and the animal was at our mercy.\r\n\r\n"Now we have got him," said Jack, as he looked at the poor beast, lying\r\npanting on the ground, "what are we to do with him?"\r\n\r\n"I will show you," said I; "help me to fasten his forelegs together, and\r\nyou shall see the next operation."\r\n\r\nThe bull, thus secured, could not move; and while Jack held his head I\r\ndrew my knife and pierced the cartilage of his nose, and when the blood\r\nflowed less freely, passed a stout cord through the hole. I felt some\r\nrepugnance at thus paining the animal, but it was a case of necessity,\r\nand I could not hesitate. We united the ends of the cord, freed the\r\nanimal, set him upon his legs, and, subdued and overawed, he followed us\r\nwithout resistance. I now turned my attention to the dead buffalo, but\r\nas I could not then skin it, I contented myself with cutting off the\r\nmost delicate parts, its tongue, and a couple of steaks, and, packing\r\nthem in salt in my wallet, abandoned the rest to the dogs. They fell\r\nupon it greedily, and we retired under the shade to enjoy a meal after\r\nour hard work. The dogs, however, were not to have undisputed possession\r\nof the carcass; vultures, crows, and other birds of prey, with that\r\nmarvelous instinct which always leads them to a dead body, quickly\r\nfilled the air, and, with discordant cries, swooped down upon the\r\nbuffalo. An amusing contest ensued; the dogs again and again drove off\r\nthe intruders, and they, as often, returned re-enforced by others who\r\nswarmed to the spot. Jack, with his usual impetuosity, wished to send a\r\nshot in among the robber band, but I prevented him, for I knew that the\r\nbird or two he might kill would be of no use to us, while his shot would\r\nnot drive away the rest, even had we wished it. Both he and the dogs\r\nwere at length satisfied, and as it was getting late, I determined to\r\ngive up for the present the search for the ass, and to return to our\r\ncamp. We again made our way through the bamboos, but before we left the\r\nthicket I cut down one of the smallest of the reeds, the largest of\r\nwhose joints would form capital little barrels, while those near the\r\ntapering top would serve as molds for our next batch of candles.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo, with a dog on either side and the rope through his nose,\r\nwas following us passively, and we presently induced him to submit to a\r\npackage of our goods laid upon his back. We pushed rapidly forward, Jack\r\neager to display our latest acquisition. As we repassed the rocky bed of\r\na stream we had crossed in the morning, Juno dashed ahead, and was about\r\nto rush into a cleft between the rocks, when the appearance of a large\r\njackal suddenly checked her further progress. Both dogs instantly flew\r\nat the animal, and though she fought desperately, quickly overpowered\r\nand throttled her. From the way the beast had shown fight, I concluded\r\nthat her young must be close by, probably within the very cleft Juno was\r\nabout to enter.\r\n\r\nDirectly Jack heard this, he wished to creep in and bring out the young\r\njackals. I hesitated to allow him to do so, for I thought it possible\r\nthat the male jackal might be still lying in wait within the cave. We\r\npeered into the darkness, and, after a while, Jack declared he could\r\ndiscern the little yellow jackals, and that he was quite sure the old\r\none was not there. He then crept in, followed closely by the dogs, and\r\npresently emerged, bearing in his arms a handsome cub of a beautiful\r\ngolden yellow and about the size of a small cat. He was the only one of\r\nthe brood he had managed to save, for Turk and Juno, without pity for\r\ntheir youth or beauty, had worried all the rest. I did not much regret\r\nthis, however, for I firmly believe that, had he saved them, Jack would\r\nhave insisted upon bringing up the whole litter. As it was, I considered\r\nthat one jackal was, with our young bull, quite sufficient an addition\r\nto our livestock.\r\n\r\nDuring the halt we had made I had fastened the buffalo to a small tree,\r\nand as I was now again about to move on, I recognized it as the\r\ndwarf-palm, whose long, sharp leaves form an excellent barrier if it is\r\nplanted as a hedge. I determined to return and get some young plants to\r\nstrengthen our hedge at Tentholm. It was late before we reached our\r\ncamp, where we found our family anxiously awaiting our return.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the new animals delighted the children immensely, and\r\nin their opinion amply compensated for the loss of our poor donkey.\r\nJack had to answer a host of questions concerning their capture,\r\nand to give a minute account of the affray with the buffaloes. This\r\nhe did, with graphic power certainly, but with so much boasting and\r\nself-glorification that I was obliged to check him, and give a\r\nplain and unvarnished account of the affair.\r\n\r\nSuppertime arrived, and as we sat at that meal, for which Jack and I\r\nwere heartily thankful, my wife and her party proceeded to give an\r\naccount of their day\'s work.\r\n\r\nErnest had discovered a sago-palm, and had, after much labor, contrived\r\nto fell it. Franz and his mother had collected dry wood, of which a huge\r\nheap now stood before the tent, sufficient to keep up a fire all the\r\nrest of the time we should stay on the spot. Fritz had gone off shooting\r\nand had secured a good bag. While they had been thus variously employed,\r\na troop of apes had visited the tent, and when they returned, they found\r\nthe place ransacked and turned upside down. The provisions were eaten\r\nand gnawed, the potatoes thrown about, the milk drunk and spilt; every\r\nbox had been peeped into, every pot and pan had been divested of its\r\nlid; the palisade round the hut had been partly destroyed, nothing had\r\nbeen left untouched. Industriously had the boys worked to repair the\r\ndamage, and when we returned not a sign was to be seen of the disorder.\r\nNo one would have guessed what had occurred from the delicious supper we\r\nwere eating.\r\n\r\nAfter matters had been again arranged, Fritz had gone down to the shore,\r\nand, among the rocks at Cape Disappointment, had discovered a young\r\neaglet which Ernest declared to be a Malabar or Indian eagle; he was\r\nmuch pleased with his discovery, and I recommended him to bring the bird\r\nup and try to train it to hunt as a falcon.\r\n\r\n"Look here, though, boys," said I, "you are now collecting a good many\r\npets, and I am not going to have your mother troubled with the care of\r\nthem all; each must look after his own, and if I find one neglected,\r\nwhether beast or bird, I set it at liberty. Mark that and remember it!"\r\n\r\nMy wife looked greatly relieved at this announcement, and the boys\r\npromised to obey my directions. Before we retired for the night I\r\nprepared the buffalo meat I had brought. I lit a large fire of green\r\nwood, and in the smoke of this thoroughly dried both the tongue and\r\nsteaks. We then properly secured all the animals, Jack took his little\r\npet in his arms, and we lay down and were soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak we were on foot, and began to prepare for a return to\r\nFalconhurst.\r\n\r\n"You are not going to despise my sago, I hope," said Ernest; "you have\r\nno idea what a trouble it was to cut it down, and I have been thinking\r\ntoo, that, if we could but split the tree, we might make a couple of\r\nlong useful troughs, which might, I think, be made to carry water from\r\nJackal River to Tentholm. Is my plan worth consideration?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is," I replied; "and at all events we must not abandon such a\r\nvaluable prize as a sago palm. I would put off our departure for a day\r\nrather than leave it behind."\r\n\r\nWe went to the palm, and with the tools we had with us attempted to\r\nsplit the trunk. We first sawed off the upper end, and then with an ax\r\nand saw managed to insert a wedge. This accomplished, our task was less\r\ndifficult, for with a heavy mallet we forced the wedge in further and\r\nfurther, until at length the trunk was split in twain. From one half of\r\nthe trunk we then removed the pith, disengaging it, with difficulty,\r\nfrom the tough wood fibers; at each end, however, I left a portion of\r\nthe pith untouched, thus forming a trough in which to work the sago.\r\n\r\n"Now, boys," said I, when we had removed the pith from the other half of\r\nthe trunk, "off with your coats and turn up your shirt-sleeves; I am\r\ngoing to teach you to knead."\r\n\r\nThey were all delighted, and even little Franz begged to be allowed to\r\nhelp. Ernest brought a couple of pitchers of water, and throwing it in\r\namongst the pith, we set to work quite heartily. As the dough was formed\r\nand properly kneaded, I handed it to the mother, who spread it out on a\r\ncloth in the sun to dry. This new occupation kept us busy until the\r\nevening, and when it was at length completed we loaded the cart with the\r\nsago, a store of cocoanuts, and our other possessions, that we might be\r\nready to start early on the following morning. As the sun rose above the\r\nhorizon, we packed up our tent and set forth, a goodly caravan. I\r\nthought it unfair to the cow to make her drag such a load as we now had\r\nalone, and determined if possible to make the young buffalo take the\r\nplace of our lost donkey: after some persuasion he consented, and soon\r\nput his strength to the work and brought the cart along famously. As we\r\nhad the trough slung under the cart we had to choose the clearest\r\npossible route, avoiding anything like a thicket; we, therefore, could\r\nnot pass directly by the candleberry and caoutchouc trees, and I sent\r\nErnest and Jack aside to visit the store we had made on our outward\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThey had not long been gone when I was alarmed by a most terrible noise,\r\naccompanied by the furious barking of the dogs and shouts from Jack and\r\nErnest. Thinking that the boys had been attacked by some wild beasts, I\r\nran to their assistance. A most ludicrous scene awaited me when I\r\nreached the spot. They were dancing and shouting round and round a\r\ngrassy glade, and I as nearly as possible followed their example, for in\r\nthe center, surrounded by a promising litter, lay our old sow, whose\r\nsqueals, previously so alarming, were now subsiding into comfortable\r\ngrunts of recognition. I did not join my boys in their triumphal dance,\r\nbut I was nevertheless very much pleased at the sight of the flourishing\r\nfamily, and immediately returned to the cart to obtain biscuits and\r\npotatoes for the benefit of the happy mother. Jack and Ernest meanwhile\r\npushed further on and brought back the sack of candleberries and the\r\ncaoutchouc, and as we could not then take the sow with us, we left her\r\nalone with her family and proceeded to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nThe animals were delighted to see us back again, and received us with\r\nmanifestations of joy, but looked askance at the new pets. The eagle\r\nespecially came in for shy glances, and promised to be no favorite.\r\nFritz, however, determined that his pet should at present do no harm,\r\nsecured him by the leg to a root of a fig tree and uncovered his eyes.\r\nIn a moment the aspect of the bird was changed; with his sight returned\r\nall his savage instincts, he flapped his wings, raised his head, darted\r\nto the full length of his chain, and before any one could prevent him\r\nseized the unfortunate parrot, which stood near, and tore it to pieces.\r\nFritz\'s anger rose at the sight, and he was about to put an end to the\r\nsavage bird.\r\n\r\n"Stop," said Ernest, "don\'t kill the poor creature, he is but following\r\nhis natural instincts; give him to me, and I will tame him."\r\n\r\nFritz hesitated. "No, no," he said, "I don\'t want really to kill the\r\nbird, but I can\'t give him up; tell me how to tame him, and you shall\r\nhave Master Knips."\r\n\r\n"Very well," replied Ernest, "I will tell you my plan, and if it\r\nsucceeds, I will accept Knips as a mark of your gratitude. Take a pipe\r\nand tobacco, and send the smoke all around his head, so that he must\r\ninhale it; by degrees he will become stupefied, and his savage nature\r\nfrom that moment subdued."\r\n\r\nFritz was rather inclined to ridicule the plan, but, knowing that Ernest\r\ngenerally had a good reason for anything of the sort that he proposed,\r\nhe consented to make the attempt. He soon seated himself beneath the\r\nbird, who still struggled furiously, and puffed cloud after cloud\r\nupward, and as each cloud circled round the eagle\'s head he became\r\nquieter and quieter, until he sat quite still, gazing stupidly at the\r\nyoung smoker.\r\n\r\n"Capital!" cried Fritz, as he hooded the bird, "capital, Ernest; Knips\r\nis yours."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n Prop our young trees--A lecture on grafting--A new idea broached--Why\r\n     should we not build stairs within the trunk of our tree?--Jack\r\n     finds one objection--I make a beehive, and we drive the bees from\r\n     the tree--Stair-making--Additions to our family of domestic\r\n     animals--The education of the "pets"--Shoemaking--We lead water\r\n     from the stream to Falconhurst--A strange animal approaches--Our\r\n     old ass and his companion--The onager captured--Provisioning our\r\n     winter quarters--Capture of ruffed grouse--We discover flax--The\r\n     rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning the boys and I started with the cart, laden with our\r\nbundles of bamboos, to attend to the avenue of fruit trees. The buffalo\r\nwe left behind, for his services were not needed, and I wished the wound\r\nin his nostrils to become completely cicatrized before I again put him\r\nto work. We were not a moment too soon; many of the young trees, which\r\nbefore threatened to fall, had now fulfilled their promise, and were\r\nlying prostrate on the ground, others were bent, some few only remained\r\nerect. We raised the trees, and digging deeply at their roots, drove in\r\nstout bamboo props, to which we lashed them firmly with strong broad\r\nfibers.\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Franz, as we were thus engaged, and he handed me the fibers\r\nas I required them, "are these wild or tame trees?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, these are wild trees, most ferocious trees," laughed Jack, "and we\r\nare tying them up lest they should run away, and in a little while we\r\nwill untie them and they will trot about after us and give us fruit\r\nwherever we go. Oh, we will tame them; they shall have a ring through\r\ntheir noses like the buffalo!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true," replied Franz gravely, "but there _are_ wild and\r\ntame trees, the wild ones grow out in the woods like the crab-apples,\r\nand the tame ones in the garden like the pears and peaches at home.\r\nWhich are these, papa?"\r\n\r\n"They are not wild," I replied, "but grafted or cultivated, or, as you\r\ncall them, tame trees. No European tree bears good fruit until it is\r\ngrafted!" I saw a puzzled look come over the little boy\'s face as he\r\nheard this new word, and I hastened to explain it. "Grafting," I\r\ncontinued, "is the process of inserting a slip or twig of a tree into\r\nwhat is called an eye; that is, a knot or hole in the branch of another.\r\nThis twig or slip then grows and produces, not such fruit as the\r\noriginal stock would have borne, but such as the tree from which it was\r\ntaken would have produced. Thus, if we have a sour crab tree, and an\r\napple tree bearing fine ribston pippins, we would take a slip of the\r\nlatter, insert it in an eye of the former, and in a year or two the\r\nbranch which would then grow would be laden with good apples."\r\n\r\n"But," asked Ernest, "where did the slips of good fruit trees come from,\r\nif none grow without grafting?"\r\n\r\n"From foreign countries," I replied. "It is only in the cold climate of\r\nour part of the world that they require this grafting; in many parts of\r\nthe world, in more southern latitudes than ours, the most luscious fruit\r\ntrees are indigenous to the soil, and flourish and bear sweet, wholesome\r\nfruit, without the slightest care or attention being bestowed upon them;\r\nwhile in England and Germany, and even in France, these same trees\r\nrequire the utmost exertion of horticultural skill to make them bring\r\nforth any fruit whatever. Thus, when the Romans invaded England they\r\nfound there nothing in the way of fruit trees but the crab-apple, nut\r\nbushes, and bramble bushes, but by grafting on these, fine apples,\r\nfilberts, and raspberries were produced, and it was the same in our own\r\ndear Switzerland--all our fruit trees were imported."\r\n\r\n"Were cherries, father? May we not even call cherries Swiss? I always\r\nthought they grew nowhere else."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid we cannot even claim cherries as our own, not even the name\r\nof them; they are called cherries from Cerasus, a state of Pontus, in\r\nAsia, whence they were brought to Europe by Lucullus, a Roman general,\r\nabout seventy years before Christ. Hazelnuts also came from Pontus;\r\nwalnuts, again, came originally from Persia. As for grapes, they are of\r\nthe greatest antiquity. We hear, if you remember, of Noah cultivating\r\nvines, and they have been brought from one place to another until they\r\nnow are to be found in most parts of the civilized world."\r\n\r\n"Do you think all these trees will grow?" asked Fritz, as we crossed\r\nJackal River and entered our plantation at Tentholm: "here are lemons,\r\npomegranates, pistachio nuts, and mulberries."\r\n\r\n"I have little doubt of it," I replied, "we are evidently within the\r\ntropics, where such trees as these are sure to flourish. These pines,\r\nnow, come from France, Spain, and Italy; the olives from Armenia and\r\nPalestine; the figs originally from the island of Chios; the peaches and\r\napricots from Persia; plums from Damascus in Syria, and the pears of all\r\nsorts from Greece. However, if our countries have not been blessed in\r\nthe same way with fruit, we have been given wisdom and skill, which has\r\nenabled us to import and cultivate the trees of other lands."\r\n\r\nWe thus talked and worked until every tree that required treatment was\r\nprovided with a stout bamboo prop, and then, with appetites which a\r\ngourmand might well have envied, we returned to Falconhurst. I think the\r\ngood mother was almost alarmed at the way we fell upon the corned beef\r\nand palm-cabbage she set before us, but at length these good things\r\nproduced the desired effect, and one after another declared himself\r\nsatisfied. As we sat reclining after our labor and digesting our dinner,\r\nwe discussed the various projects we had in contemplation. "I wish,"\r\nsaid my wife, "that you would invent some other plan for climbing to the\r\nnest above us; I think that the nest itself is perfect--I really wish\r\nfor nothing better, but I should like to be able to get to it without\r\nscaling that dreadful ladder every time; could you not make a flight of\r\nsteps to reach it?"\r\n\r\nI carefully thought over the project, and turned over every plan for its\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\n"It would be impossible, I am afraid," said I, "to make stairs outside,\r\nbut within the trunk it might be done. More than once have I thought\r\nthat this trunk might be hollow, or partly so, and if such be the case\r\nour task would be comparatively easy. Did you not tell me the other day\r\nthat you noticed bees coming from a hole in the tree?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said little Franz, "and I went to look at them and one flew\r\nright against my face and stung me, and I almost cried, but I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Brave little boy," said I. "Well, now, if the trunk be sufficiently\r\nhollow to contain a swarm of bees, it may be, for all we can tell,\r\nhollow the greater part of its length, for like the willow in our own\r\ncountry it might draw all its nourishment through the bark, and in spite\r\nof its real unsoundness retain a flourishing appearance."\r\n\r\nMaster Jack, practical as usual, instantly sprang to his feet to put my\r\nconjecture to the proof. The rest followed his example, and they were\r\nall soon climbing about like squirrels, peeping into the hole, and\r\ntapping the wood to discover by sound how far down the cavity extended.\r\n\r\nThey forgot, in their eagerness, who were the tenants of this\r\ninteresting trunk. They were soon reminded of it, however, for the bees,\r\ndisturbed by this unusual noise, with an angry buzz burst out, and in an\r\ninstant attacked the causers of the annoyance; they swarmed round them,\r\nstung them on the hands, face, and neck, settled in their hair, and\r\npursued them as they ran to me for assistance. It was with difficulty\r\nthat we got rid of the angry insects and were able to attend to the\r\nboys. Jack, who had been the first to reach the hole, had fared the\r\nworst, and was soon a most pitiable sight, his face swelled to an\r\nextraordinary degree, and it was only by the constant application of\r\ncold earth that the pain was alleviated. They were all eager to commence\r\nan organized attack upon the bees at once, but for an hour or more, by\r\nreason of their pain, they were unable to render me much assistance. In\r\nthe meanwhile I made my arrangements. I first took a large calabash\r\ngourd, for I intended to make a beehive, that, when we had driven the\r\ninsects from their present abode, we might not lose them entirely. The\r\nlower half of the gourd I flattened, I then cut an arched opening in the\r\nfront for a doorway, made a straw roof as a protection from the rain and\r\nheat, and the little house was complete.\r\n\r\nNothing more, however, could then be done, for the irritated bees were\r\nstill angrily buzzing round the tree. I waited till dark, and then, when\r\nall the bees had again returned to their trunk, with Fritz\'s assistance\r\nI carefully stopped up every hole in the tree with wet clay, that the\r\nbees might not issue forth next morning before we could begin\r\noperations. Very early were we up and at work. I first took a hollow\r\ncane, and inserted one end through the clay into the tree; down this\r\ntube with pipe and tobacco I smoked most furiously.\r\n\r\nThe humming and buzzing that went on within was tremendous; the bees\r\nevidently could not understand what was going to happen. I finished my\r\nfirst pipeful, and putting my thumb over the end of the cane, I gave the\r\npipe to Fritz to refill. He did so and I again smoked. The buzzing was\r\nnow becoming less noisy, and was subsiding into a mere murmur. By the\r\ntime I had finished this second pipe all was still; the bees were\r\nstupefied.\r\n\r\n"Now then, Fritz," said I, "quick, with a hammer and chisel, and stand\r\nhere beside me."\r\n\r\nHe was up in a moment, and, together, we cut a small door by the side of\r\nthe hole; this door, however, we did not take out, but we left it\r\nattached by one corner that it might be removed at a moment\'s notice;\r\nthen giving the bees a final dose of tobacco smoke, we opened it.\r\n\r\nCarefully but rapidly we removed the insects, as they clung in clusters\r\nto the sides of the tree, and placed them in the hive prepared for their\r\nreception. As rapidly I then took every atom of wax and honey from their\r\nstorehouse, and put it in a cask I had made ready for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe bees were now safely removed from the trunk, but I could not tell\r\nwhether, when they revived from their temporary stupor, they might not\r\nrefuse to occupy the house with which I had presented them, and insist\r\non returning to their old quarters. To prevent the possibility of this\r\noccurrence, I took a quantity of tobacco, and placing it upon a board\r\nnailed horizontally within the trunk, I lighted it and allowed it to\r\nburn slowly, that the fumes might fill the cavity. It was well I did so,\r\nfor, as the bees returned to consciousness, they left their pretty hive\r\nand buzzed away to the trunk of the tree. They seemed astonished at\r\nfinding this uninhabitable, and an immense deal of noisy humming ensued.\r\nRound and round they flew, backward and forward between the gourd and\r\ntree, now settling here and now there, until, at length, after due\r\nconsideration, they took possession of the hive and abandoned their\r\nformer habitation to us, the invaders of their territory. By the evening\r\nthey were quite quiet, and we ventured to open the cask in which we had\r\nstored our plunder. We first separated the honey from the honeycomb and\r\npoured it off into jars and pots; the rest we then took and threw into a\r\nvessel of water placed over a slow fire. It soon boiled and the entire\r\nmass became fluid. This we placed in a clean canvas bag, and subjected\r\nto a heavy pressure. The honey was thus soon forced out, and we stored\r\nit in a cask, and, though not perhaps quite equal to the former batch in\r\nquality, it was yet capital. The wax that remained in the bag I also\r\ncarefully stored, for I knew it would be of great use to me in the\r\nmanufacture of candles. Then after a hard day\'s work we turned in.\r\n\r\nThe internal architecture of the tree had now to be attended to, and\r\nearly the following morning we prepared for the laborious task. A door\r\nhad first to be made, so at the base of the trunk we cut away the bark\r\nand formed an opening just the size of the door we had brought from the\r\ncaptain\'s cabin, and which, hinges and all, was ready to be hung. The\r\nclearing of the rotten wood from the center of the trunk occupied us\r\nsome time, but at length we had the satisfaction of seeing it entirely\r\naccomplished, and, as we stood below, we could look up the trunk, which\r\nwas like a great smooth funnel, and see the sky above. It was now ready\r\nfor the staircase, and first we erected in the center a stout sapling to\r\nform an axis round which to build the spiral stairs; in this we cut\r\nnotches to receive the steps, and corresponding notches in the tree\r\nitself to support the outer ends. The steps themselves we formed\r\ncarefully and neatly of planks from the wreck, and clenched them firmly\r\nin their places with stout nails. Upward and upward we built, cutting\r\nwindows in the trunk as we required, to admit light and air, until we\r\nwere flush with the top of the center pole. On this pole we erected\r\nanother to reach the top of the tree, and securing it firmly, built in\r\nthe same way round it until we at length reached the level of the floor\r\nof the nest above. To make the ascent of the stairs perfectly easy we\r\nran a hand-rail on either side, one round the center pillar, and the\r\nother following the curve of the trunk.\r\n\r\nThis task occupied us a whole month, and by the end of that period, so\r\naccustomed had we become to having a definite piece of work before us\r\nthat we began to consider what other great alteration we should\r\nundertake. We were, however, of course not neglecting the details of our\r\ncolonial establishment. There were all the animals to be attended to;\r\nthe goats and sheep had both presented us with additions to our flock,\r\nand these frisky youngsters had to be seen after; to prevent them\r\nstraying to any great distance--for we had no wish to lose them--we tied\r\nround their necks little bells, which we had found on board the wreck,\r\nand which would assist us to track them. Juno, too, had a fine litter\r\nof puppies, but, in spite of the entreaties of the children, I could not\r\nconsent to keep more than two, and the rest disappeared in that\r\nmysterious way in which puppies and kittens are wont to leave the earth.\r\nTo console the mother, as he said, but also, I suspect, to save himself\r\nconsiderable trouble, Jack placed his little jackal beside the remaining\r\npuppies, and, to his joy, found it readily adopted. The other pets were\r\nalso flourishing, and were being usefully trained. The buffalo, after\r\ngiving us much trouble, had now become perfectly domesticated, and was a\r\nvery useful beast of burden, besides being a capital steed for the boys.\r\nThey guided him by a bar thrust through the hole in his nose, which was\r\nnow perfectly healed, and this served the purpose just as a bit in the\r\nmouth of a horse. I began his education by securing round him a broad\r\ngirth of buffalo hide and fastening to it various articles, to accustom\r\nhim to carrying a burden. By degrees he permitted this to be done\r\nwithout making the slightest resistance, and soon carried the paniers,\r\nbefore borne by the ass, readily and willingly.\r\n\r\nI then made Master Knips sit upon his back and hold the reins I had\r\nprepared for him, that the animal might become accustomed to the feeling\r\nof a rider, and finally allowed Fritz himself to mount. The education of\r\nthe eagle was not neglected. Fritz every day shot small birds for his\r\nfood, and these he placed, sometimes between the wide-spreading horns of\r\nthe buffalo or goat, and, sometimes upon the back of the great bustard,\r\nthat he might become accustomed to pounce upon living prey. These\r\nlessons had their due effect, and the bird, having been taught to obey\r\nthe voice and whistle of his master, he was soon allowed to bring down\r\nsmall birds upon the wing, when he stooped and struck his quarry in most\r\nsportsmanlike manner. We kept him well away from the poultry yard, lest\r\nhis natural instincts should show themselves and he should put an\r\nuntimely end to some of our feathered pets.\r\n\r\nNeither was Master Knips allowed to remain idle, for Ernest, now that he\r\nwas in his possession, wished to train him to be of some use. With\r\nJack\'s help he made a little basket of rushes, which he so arranged with\r\nstraps that it might be easily fitted on to the monkey\'s back. Thus\r\nequipped, he was taught to mount cocoanut palms and other lofty trees,\r\nand to bring down their fruit in the hamper.\r\n\r\nJack was not so successful in his educational attempts. Fangs, as he had\r\nchristened his jackal, used his fangs, indeed, but only on his own\r\naccount; nothing could persuade him that the animals he caught were not\r\nat once to be devoured, consequently poor Jack was never able to save\r\nfrom his jaws anything but the tattered skin of his prey. Not\r\ndisheartened, however, he determined that Fangs could be trained, and\r\nthat he would train him.\r\n\r\nThese, and such like employment, afforded us the rest and recreation we\r\nrequired while engaged in the laborious task of staircase building.\r\n\r\nAmong minor occupations, I applied myself to the improvement of our\r\ncandles. Though the former batch had greatly delighted us at first, yet\r\nwe were soon obliged to acknowledge that the light they gave was\r\nimperfect, and their appearance was unsightly; my wife, too, begged me\r\nto find some substitute for the threads of our cotton neckties, which I\r\nhad previously used as wicks. To give the proper shape and smoothness to\r\nthe candles, I determined to use the bamboo molds I had prepared. My\r\nfirst idea was to pour the wax in at the end of the mold, and then when\r\nthe candles were cooled to slip them out; but I was soon convinced that\r\nthis plan would not succeed. I therefore determined to divide the molds\r\nlength-ways, and then having greased them well, we might pour the melted\r\nwax into the two halves bound tightly together, and so be able to take\r\nout the candles when cool without injuring them. The wicks were my next\r\ndifficulty, and as the mother positively refused to allow us to devote\r\nour ties and handkerchiefs for the purpose, I took a piece of\r\ninflammable wood from a tree, a native of the Antilles, which I thought\r\nwould serve our purpose; this I cut into long slips, and fixed in the\r\ncenters of the molds. My wife, too, prepared some wicks from the fibers\r\nof the karata tree, which she declared would beat mine completely out of\r\nthe field. We put them to the proof.\r\n\r\nOn a large fire we placed a pot, in which we prepared our wax\r\nmixture--half beeswax and half wax from the candleberries. The molds,\r\ncarefully prepared--half with karata fiber, and half with wooden splint\r\nwicks--stood on their ends in a tub of cold water, ready to receive the\r\nwax. They were filled; the wax cooled; the candles taken out and\r\nsubjected to the criticism of all hands. When night drew on, they were\r\nformally tested. The decision was unanimous: neither gave such a good\r\nlight as those with the cotton wicks; but even my wife declared that the\r\nlight from mine was far preferable to that emitted by hers, for the\r\nformer, though rather flaring, burned brilliantly, while the latter gave\r\nout such a feeble and flickering flame that it was almost useless.\r\n\r\nI then turned shoemaker, for I had promised myself a pair of waterproof\r\nboots, and now I determined to make them.\r\n\r\nTaking a pair of socks, I filled them with sand and then coated\r\nthem over with a thin layer of clay to form a convenient mold; this\r\nwas soon hardened in the sun, and was ready for use. Layer after\r\nlayer of caoutchouc I brushed over it, allowing each layer to dry\r\nbefore the next was put on, until at length I considered that the\r\nshoes were of sufficient thickness. I dried them, broke out the\r\nclay, secured with nails a strip of buffalo hide to the soles,\r\nbrushed that over with caoutchouc, and I had a pair of comfortable,\r\ndurable, respectable-looking waterproof boots.\r\n\r\nI was delighted; orders poured in from all sides, and soon every one in\r\nthe family was likewise provided for.\r\n\r\nOne objection to Falconhurst was the absence of any spring close by, so\r\nthat the boys were obliged to bring water daily from the stream; and\r\nthis involving no little trouble, it was proposed that we should carry\r\nthe water by pipes from the stream to our present residence. A dam had\r\nto be thrown across the river some way up stream, that the water might\r\nbe raised to a sufficient height to run to Falconhurst. From the\r\nreservoir thus made we led the water down by pipes into the turtle\'s\r\nshell, which we placed near our dwelling, and from which the superfluous\r\nwater flowed off through the hole made in it by Fritz\'s harpoon. This\r\nwas an immense convenience, and we formally inaugurated the trough by\r\nwashing therein a whole sack of potatoes. Thus day after day brought its\r\nown work, and day after day saw that work completed. We had no time to\r\nbe idle, or to lament our separation from our fellow creatures.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as we were completing our spiral staircase, and giving it\r\nsuch finish as we were capable of, we were suddenly alarmed by hearing a\r\nmost terrific noise, the roaring or bellowing of a wild beast; so\r\nstrange a sound was it, that I could not imagine by what animal it was\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\nJack thought it perhaps a lion, Fritz hazarded a gorilla, while Ernest\r\ngave it as his opinion, and I thought it possible that he was right,\r\nthat it was a hyena.\r\n\r\n"Whatever it is," said I, "we must prepare to receive it; up with you\r\nall to the nest while I secure the door."\r\n\r\nThen arming the dogs with their collars, I sent them out to protect the\r\nanimals below, closed the door, and joined my family. Every gun was\r\nloaded, every eye was upon the watch. The sound drew nearer, and then\r\nall was still; nothing was to be seen. I determined to descend and\r\nreconnoiter, and Fritz and I carefully crept down; with our guns at full\r\ncock we glided among the trees; noiselessly and quickly we pushed on\r\nfurther and further; suddenly, close by, we heard the terrific sound\r\nagain. Fritz raised his gun, but almost as quickly again dropped it,\r\nand burst into a hearty fit of laughter. There was no mistaking those\r\ndulcet tones--he-haw, he-haw, he-haw--resounded through the forest, and\r\nour ass, braying his approach right merrily, appeared in sight. To our\r\nsurprise, however, our friend was not alone: behind him trotted another\r\nanimal, an ass no doubt, but slim and graceful as a horse. We watched\r\ntheir movements anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Fritz," I whispered, "that is an onager. Creep back to Falconhurst and\r\nbring me a piece of cord--quietly now!"\r\n\r\nWhile he was gone, I cut a bamboo and split it half-way down to form a\r\npair of pincers, which I knew would be of use to me should I get near\r\nthe animal. Fritz soon returned with the cord, and I was glad to observe\r\nalso brought some oats and salt. We made one end of the cord fast to a\r\ntree, and at the other end made a running noose. Silently we watched the\r\nanimals as they approached, quietly browsing; Fritz then arose, holding\r\nin one hand the noose and in the other some oats and salt. The ass,\r\nseeing his favorite food thus held out, advanced to take it; Fritz\r\nallowed him to do so, and he was soon munching contentedly. The\r\nstranger, on seeing Fritz, started back; but finding her companion show\r\nno signs of alarm, was reassured, and soon approached sniffing, and was\r\nabout to take some of the tempting food. In a moment the noose left\r\nFritz\'s adroit hand and fell round her neck; with a single bound she\r\nsprang backward the full length of the cord, the noose drew tight, and\r\nshe fell to the earth half strangled. I at once ran up, loosened the\r\nrope, and replaced it by a halter; and placing the pincers upon her\r\nnose, secured her by two cords fastened between two trees, and then left\r\nher to recover herself.\r\n\r\nEvery one hastened up to examine the beautiful animal as she rose to the\r\nground and cast fiery glances around. She lashed out with her heels on\r\nevery side; and, giving vent to angry snorts, struggled violently to get\r\nfree. All her endeavors were vain: the cords were stout, and after a\r\nwhile she quieted down and stood exhausted and quivering. I then\r\napproached: she suffered me to lead her to the roots of our tree, which\r\nfor the present formed our stables, and there I tied her up close to the\r\ndonkey, who was likewise prevented from playing truant.\r\n\r\nNext morning I found the onager after her night\'s rest as wild as ever,\r\nand as I looked at the handsome creature I almost despaired of ever\r\ntaming her proud spirit. Every expedient was tried, and at length, when\r\nthe animal was subdued by hunger, I thought I might venture to mount\r\nher; and having given her the strongest curb and shackled her feet I\r\nattempted to do so. She was as unruly as ever, and as a last expedient I\r\nresolved to adopt a plan which, though cruel, was I knew attended with\r\nwonderful success by the American Indians, by whom it is practiced.\r\nWatching a favorable opportunity, I sprang upon the onager\'s back, and\r\nseizing her long ear in my teeth, in spite of her kicking and plunging,\r\nbit it through. The result was marvelous, the animal ceased plunging,\r\nand, quivering violently, stood stock still. From that moment we were\r\nher masters, the children mounted her one after the other, and she\r\ncarried them obediently and quietly. Proud, indeed, did I feel as I\r\nwatched this animal, which naturalists and travelers have declared to be\r\nbeyond the power of man to tame, guided hither and thither by my\r\nyoungest son.\r\n\r\nAdditions to our poultry yard reminded me of the necessity of providing\r\nsome substantial shelter for our animals before the rainy season came\r\non; three broods of chickens had been successfully hatched, and the\r\nlittle creatures, forty in all, were my wife\'s pride and delight. We\r\nbegan by making a roof over the vaulted roots of our tree, forming the\r\nframework of bamboo canes, which we laid close together and bound\r\ntightly down; others we fixed below as supports. The interstices were\r\nfilled up with clay and moss; and coating the whole over with a mixture\r\nof tar and lime-water, we obtained a firm balcony, and a capital roof\r\nimpervious to the severest fall of rain. I ran a light rail round the\r\nbalcony to give it a more ornamental appearance, and below divided the\r\nbuilding into several compartments. Stables, poultry yard, hay and\r\nprovision lofts, dairy, kitchen, larder, and dining-hall were united\r\nunder one roof.\r\n\r\nOur winter quarters were now completed, and we had but to store them\r\nwith food. Day after day we worked, bringing in provisions of every\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAs we were one evening returning from gathering potatoes, it struck me\r\nthat we should take in a store of acorns; and sending the two younger\r\nboys home with their mother and the cart, I took a large canvas bag, and\r\nwith Fritz and Ernest, the former mounted on his onager, and the latter\r\ncarrying his little favorite, Knips, made a detour toward the Acorn\r\nWood.\r\n\r\nWe reached the spot, tied Lightfoot to a neighboring tree, and began\r\nrapidly to fill the sack. As we were thus engaged, Knips sprang suddenly\r\ninto a bush close by, from which, a moment afterward, issued such\r\nstrange cries that Ernest followed to see what could be the matter.\r\n\r\n"Come!" he shouted; "come and help me! I\'ve got a couple of birds and\r\ntheir eggs. Quick! Ruffed grouse!"\r\n\r\nWe hurried to the spot. There was Ernest with a fluttering, screaming\r\nbird in either hand; while, with his foot, he was endeavoring to prevent\r\nhis greedy little monkey from seizing the eggs. We quickly tied the legs\r\nof the birds, and removing the eggs from the nest, placed them in\r\nErnest\'s hat; while he gathered some of the long, broad grass, with\r\nwhich the nest was woven, and which grew luxuriantly around, for Franz\r\nto play at sword-drill with. We then loaded the onager with the acorns,\r\nand moved homeward. The eggs I covered carefully with dry moss, that\r\nthey might be kept warm, and as soon as possible I handed them over to\r\nmy wife, who managed the mother so cleverly that she induced her to\r\nreturn to the eggs, and in a few days, to our great delight, we had\r\nfifteen beautiful little Canadian chicks.\r\n\r\nFranz was greatly pleased with the "swords" his brother brought him;\r\nbut having no small companion on whom to exercise his valor, he amused\r\nhimself for a short time in hewing down imaginary foes, and then cut the\r\nreeds in slips, and plaited them to form a whip for Lightfoot. The\r\nleaves seemed so pliable and strong that I examined them to see to what\r\nfurther use they might be put. Their tissue was composed of long silky\r\nfibers. A sudden thought struck me--this must be New Zealand flax. I\r\ncould not rest till I had announced this invaluable discovery to my\r\nwife. She was no less delighted than I was.\r\n\r\n"Bring me the leaves!" she exclaimed. "Oh, what a delightful discovery!\r\nNo one shall now be clothed in rags; just make me a spindle, and you\r\nshall soon have shirts and stockings and trousers, all good homespun!\r\nQuick, Fritz, and bring your mother more leaves!"\r\n\r\nWe could not help smiling at her eager zeal; but Fritz and Ernest sprang\r\non their steeds, and soon the onager and buffalo were galloping home\r\nagain, each laden with a great bundle of flax. The boys dismounted and\r\ndeposited their offering at their mother\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"Capital!" she exclaimed. "I shall now show you that I am not at all\r\nbehindhand in ingenuity. This must be retted, carded, spun, and woven,\r\nand then with scissors, needle, and thread I will make you any article\r\nof clothing you choose."\r\n\r\nWe decided that Flamingo Marsh would be the best spot for the operation\r\nof steeping or "retting" the flax, and next morning we set out thither\r\nwith the cart drawn by the ass, and laden with the bundles, between\r\nwhich sat Franz and Knips, while the rest of us followed with spades and\r\nhatchets. I described to my boys as we went along the process of\r\nretting, and explained to them how steeping the flax leaves destroys the\r\nuseless membrane, while the strong fibers remain.\r\n\r\nAs we were employed in making beds for the flax and placing it in them,\r\nwe observed several nests of the flamingo. These are most curiously and\r\nskillfully made of glutinous clay, so strong that they can neither be\r\noverturned nor washed away. They are formed in the shape of blunted\r\ncones, and placed point downward; at the upper and broader end is built\r\na little platform to contain the eggs, on which the female bird sits,\r\nwith her long legs in the water on either side, until the little birds\r\nare hatched and can take to the water. For a fortnight we left the flax\r\nto steep, and then taking it out and drying it thoroughly in the sun,\r\nstored it for future use at Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nDaily did we load our cart with provisions to be brought to our winter\r\nquarters: manioc, potatoes, cocoanuts, sweet acorns, sugar-canes, were\r\nall collected and stored in abundance--for grumbling thunder, lowering\r\nskies, and sharp showers warned us that we had no time to lose. Our corn\r\nwas sowed, our animals housed, our provisions stored, when down came the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nTo continue in our nest we found impossible, and we were obliged to\r\nretreat to the trunk, where we carried such of our domestic furniture as\r\nmight have been injured by the damp. Our dwelling was indeed crowded:\r\nthe animals and provisions were below, and our beds and household goods\r\naround us, hemmed us in on every side; by dint of patience and better\r\npacking, we obtained sufficient room to work and lie down in; by\r\ndegrees, too, we became accustomed to the continual noise of the animals\r\nand the smell of the stables. The smoke from the fire, which we were\r\noccasionally obliged to light, was not agreeable; but in time even that\r\nseemed to become more bearable.\r\n\r\nTo make more space, we turned such animals as we had captured, and who\r\ntherefore might be imagined to know how to shift for themselves, outside\r\nduring the daytime, bringing them under the arched roofs only at night.\r\nTo perform this duty Fritz and I used to sally forth every evening, and\r\nas regularly every evening did we return soaked to the skin. To obviate\r\nthis, the mother, who feared these continual wettings might injure our\r\nhealth, contrived waterproofs: she brushed on several layers of\r\ncaoutchouc over stout shirts, to which she attached hoods; she then\r\nfixed to these duck trousers, and thus prepared for each of us a\r\ncomplete waterproof suit, clad in which we might brave the severest\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nIn spite of our endeavors to keep ourselves busy, the time dragged\r\nheavily. Our mornings were occupied in tending the animals; the boys\r\namused themselves with their pets, and assisted me in the manufacture of\r\ncarding-combs and a spindle for the mother. The combs I made with nails,\r\nwhich I placed head downward on a sheet of tin about an inch wide;\r\nholding the nails in their proper position I poured solder round their\r\nheads to fix them to the tin, which I then folded down on either side of\r\nthem to keep them perfectly firm. In the evening, when our room was\r\nilluminated with wax candles, I wrote a journal of all the events which\r\nhad occurred since our arrival in this foreign land; and, while the\r\nmother was busy with her needle and Ernest making sketches of birds,\r\nbeasts, and flowers with which he had met during the past months, Fritz\r\nand Jack taught little Franz to read.\r\n\r\nWeek after week rolled by. Week after week saw us still close prisoners.\r\nIncessant rain battered down above us; constant gloom hung over the\r\ndesolate scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n Spring again--We begin to hew a cave--Jack makes a discovery--We drive\r\n     the foul air from the cavern--The mother and her boys join us--We\r\n     explore the cave--Fit it up as our winter quarters--The\r\n     herring-bank--We catch seals--Fishing on a grand scale--Isinglass\r\n     and caviare--We visit our plantations--An expedition to establish\r\n     a colony--The building of "Woodlands"--Jack and Fritz return to\r\n     Falconhurst for provisions--Ernest and I explore--A "beast with a\r\n     bill"--We build a canoe--Franz undertakes the education of\r\n     Grumble--We continue our work at the cave--Carpet\r\n     making--Thanksgiving-day--A startling salute--Athletics and\r\n     shooting--Prize giving--Manufacture of birdlime--Fritz and Jack\r\n     ride off for caoutchouc--Shoot a crane and badger--Find\r\n     "Woodlands" turned upside down by monkeys--Discover ginseng.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winds at length were lulled, the sun shot his brilliant rays through\r\nthe riven clouds, the rain ceased to fall--spring had come. No prisoners\r\nset at liberty could have felt more joy than we did as we stepped forth\r\nfrom our winter abode, refreshed our eyes with the pleasant verdure\r\naround us, and our ears with the merry songs of a thousand happy birds,\r\nand drank in the pure, balmy air of spring.\r\n\r\nOur plantations were thriving vigorously. The seed we had sown was\r\nshooting through the moist earth. All nature was refreshed.\r\n\r\nOur nest was our first care; filled with leaves and broken and torn by\r\nthe wind, it looked indeed dilapidated. We worked hard, and in a few\r\ndays it was again inhabitable. My wife begged that I would now start her\r\nwith the flax, and as early as possible I built a drying-oven, and then\r\nprepared it for her use; I also, after some trouble, manufactured a\r\nbeetle-reel and spinning-wheel, and she and Franz were soon hard at\r\nwork, the little boy reeling off the thread his mother spun.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to visit Tentholm, for I feared that much of our precious\r\nstores might have suffered. Fritz and I made an excursion thither. The\r\ndamage done to Falconhurst was as nothing compared to the scene that\r\nawaited us. The tent was blown to the ground, the canvas torn to rags,\r\nthe provisions soaked, and two casks of powder utterly destroyed. We\r\nimmediately spread such things as we hoped yet to preserve in the sun to\r\ndry. The pinnace was safe, but our faithful tub-boat was dashed in\r\npieces, and the irreparable damage we had sustained made me resolve to\r\ncontrive some safer and more stable winter-quarters before the arrival\r\nof the next rainy season. Fritz proposed that we should hollow out a\r\ncave in the rock, and though the difficulties such an undertaking would\r\npresent appeared almost insurmountable, I yet determined to make the\r\nattempt; we might not, I thought, hew out a cavern of sufficient size to\r\nserve as a room, but we might at least make a cellar for the more\r\nvaluable and perishable of our stores.\r\n\r\nSome days afterward we left Falconhurst with the cart laden with a cargo\r\nof spades, hammers, chisels, pickaxes, and crowbars, and began our\r\nundertaking. On the smooth face of the perpendicular rock I drew out in\r\nchalk the size of the proposed entrance, and then, with minds bent on\r\nsuccess, we battered away. Six days of hard and incessant toil made but\r\nlittle impression; I do not think that the hole would have been a\r\nsatisfactory shelter for even Master Knips; but we still did not\r\ndespair, and were presently rewarded by coming to softer and more\r\nyielding substance; our work progressed, and our minds were relieved.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day, as our persevering blows were falling heavily, Jack,\r\nwho was working diligently with a hammer and crowbar, shouted:\r\n\r\n"Gone, father! Fritz, my bar has gone through the mountain!"\r\n\r\n"Run around and get it," laughed Fritz; "perhaps it has dropped into\r\nEurope--you must not lose a good crowbar."\r\n\r\n"But, really, it is through; it went right through the rock; I heard it\r\ncrash down inside. Oh, do come and see!" he shouted excitedly.\r\n\r\nWe sprang to his side, and I thrust the handle of my hammer into the\r\nhole he spoke of; it met with no opposition, I could turn it in any\r\ndirection I chose. Fritz handed me a long pole; I tried the depth with\r\nthat. Nothing could I feel. A thin wall, then, was all that intervened\r\nbetween us and a great cavern.\r\n\r\nWith a shout of joy, the boys battered vigorously at the rock; piece by\r\npiece fell, and soon the hole was large enough for us to enter. I\r\nstepped near the aperture, and was about to make a further examination,\r\nwhen a sudden rush of poisonous air turned me giddy, and shouting to my\r\nsons to stand off, I leaned against the rock.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself I explained to them the danger of approaching any\r\ncavern or other place where the air has for a long time been stagnant.\r\n"Unless air is incessantly renewed it becomes vitiated," I said, "and\r\nfatal to those who breathe it. The safest way of restoring it to its\r\noriginal state is to subject it to the action of fire, a few handfuls of\r\nblazing hay thrown into this hole may, if the place is small,\r\nsufficiently purify the air within to allow us to enter without danger."\r\nWe tried the experiment. The flame was extinguished the instant it\r\nentered. Though bundles of blazing grass were thrown in, no difference\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nI saw that we must apply some more efficacious remedy, and sent the boys\r\nfor a chest of signal rockets we had brought from the wreck. We let fly\r\nsome dozens of these fiery serpents, which went whizzing in, and\r\ndisappeared at apparently a vast distance from us. Some flew like\r\nradiant meteors round, lighted up the mighty circumference and\r\ndisplayed, as by a magician\'s wand, a sparkling, glittering roof. They\r\nlooked like avenging dragons driving a foul, malignant fiend out of a\r\nbeauteous palace.\r\n\r\nWe waited for a little while after these experiments, and I then again\r\nthrew in lighted hay. It burned clearly; the air was purified.\r\n\r\nFritz and I enlarged the opening, while Jack, springing on his buffalo,\r\nthundered away to Falconhurst to bear the great and astonishing news to\r\nhis mother.\r\n\r\nGreat must have been the effect of Jack\'s eloquence on those at home,\r\nfor the timbers of the bridge were soon again resounding under the swift\r\nbut heavy tramp of his steed; and he was quickly followed by the rest of\r\nour party in the cart.\r\n\r\nAll were in the highest state of excitement. Jack had stowed in the cart\r\nall the candles he could find, and we now, lighting these, shouldered\r\nour arms and entered. I led the way, sounding the ground as I advanced\r\nwith a long pole, that we might not fall unexpectedly into any great\r\nhole or chasm. Silently we marched--the mother, the boys, and even the\r\ndogs seeming overawed with the grandeur and beauty of the scene. We were\r\nin a grotto of diamonds--a vast cave of glittering crystal: the candles\r\nreflected on the walls a golden light, bright as the stars of heaven,\r\nwhile great crystal pillars rose from the floor like mighty trees,\r\nmingling their branches high above us and drooping in hundreds of\r\nstalactites, which sparkled and glittered with all the colors of the\r\nrainbow.\r\n\r\nThe floor of this magnificent palace was formed of hard, dry sand, so\r\ndry that I saw at once that we might safely take up our abode therein,\r\nwithout the slightest fear of danger from damp.\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the brilliant crystals round about us I suspected\r\ntheir nature.\r\n\r\nI tasted a piece. This was a cavern of rock salt. There was no doubt\r\nabout it--here was an unlimited supply of the best and purest salt! But\r\none thing detracted from my entire satisfaction and delight--large\r\ncrystals lay scattered here and there, which, detached from the roof,\r\nhad fallen to the ground; this, if apt to recur, would keep us in\r\nconstant peril. I examined some of the masses and discovered that they\r\nhad been all recently separated, and therefore concluded that the\r\nconcussion of the air occasioned by the rockets had caused their fall.\r\nTo satisfy ourselves, however, that there were no more pieces tottering\r\nabove us, we discharged our guns from the entrance, and watched the\r\neffect. Nothing more fell--our magnificent abode was safe.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Falconhurst with minds full of wonder at our new\r\ndiscovery, and plans for turning it to the best possible advantage.\r\n\r\nNothing was now talked of but the new house, how it should be arranged,\r\nhow it should be fitted up. The safety and comfort of Falconhurst, which\r\nhad at first seemed so great, now dwindled away in our opinion to\r\nnothing; it should be kept up, we decided, merely as a summer residence,\r\nwhile our cave should be formed into a winter house and impregnable\r\ncastle. Our attention was now fully occupied with this new house. Light\r\nand air were to be admitted, so we hewed a row of windows in the rock,\r\nwhere we fitted the window cases we had brought from the officers\'\r\ncabins. We brought the door, too, from Falconhurst, and fitted it in the\r\naperture we had made. The opening in the trunk of the tree I determined\r\nto conceal with bark, as less likely to attract the notice of wild\r\nbeasts or savages should they approach during our absence. The cave\r\nitself we divided into four parts: in front, a large compartment into\r\nwhich the door opened, subdivided into our sitting, eating, and sleeping\r\napartments; the right-hand division containing our kitchen and workshop,\r\nand the left our stables; behind all this, in the dark recesses of the\r\ncave, was our storehouse and powder-magazine. Having already undergone\r\none rainy season, we knew well its discomforts, and thought of many\r\nuseful arrangements in the laying out of our dwelling. We did not intend\r\nto be again smoke-dried; we therefore contrived a properly built fire\r\nplace and chimney; our stable arrangements, too, were better, and plenty\r\nof space was left in our workshop that we should not be hampered in\r\neven the most extensive operations.\r\n\r\nOur frequent residence at Tentholm revealed to us several important\r\nadvantages which we had not foreseen. Numbers of splendid turtles often\r\ncame ashore to deposit their eggs in the sand, and their delicious flesh\r\nafforded us many a sumptuous meal. When more than one of these creatures\r\nappeared at a time, we used to cut off their retreat to the sea, and,\r\nturning them on their backs, fasten them to a stake driven in close by\r\nthe water\'s edge, by a cord passed through a hole in their shell. We\r\nthus had fresh turtle continually within our reach; for the animals\r\nthrove well thus secured, and appeared in as good condition, after\r\nhaving been kept thus for several weeks, as others when freshly caught.\r\nLobsters, crabs, and mussels also abounded on the shore. But this was\r\nnot all; an additional surprise awaited us.\r\n\r\nAs we were one morning approaching Tentholm, we were attracted by a most\r\ncurious phenomenon. The waters out at sea appeared agitated by some\r\nunseen movement, and as they heaved and boiled, their surface, struck by\r\nthe beams of the morning sun, seemed illuminated by flashes of fire.\r\nOver the water where this disturbance was taking place hovered hundreds\r\nof birds, screaming loudly, which ever and anon would dart downward,\r\nsome plunging beneath the water, some skimming the surface. Then again\r\nthey would rise and resume their harsh cries. The shining, sparkling\r\nmass then rolled onward, and approached in a direct line our bay,\r\nfollowed by the feathered flock above. We hurried down to the shore to\r\nfurther examine this strange sight.\r\n\r\nI was convinced as we approached that it was a shoal or bank of\r\nherrings.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did I give utterance to my conjecture than I was assailed by a\r\nhost of questions concerning this herring-bank, what it was, and what\r\noccasioned it.\r\n\r\n"A herring-bank," I said, "is composed of an immense number of herrings\r\nswimming together. I can scarcely express to you the huge size of this\r\nliving bank, which extends over a great area many fathoms deep. It is\r\nfollowed by numbers of great ravenous fish, who devour quantities of the\r\nherrings, while above hover birds, as you have just seen, ready to\r\npounce down on stragglers near the top. To escape these enemies, the\r\nshoal makes for the nearest shore, and seeks safety in those shallows\r\nwhere the large fish cannot follow. But here it meets with a third great\r\nenemy. It may escape from the fish, and elude the vigilance of\r\nsharp-sighted birds, but from the ingenuity of man it can find no\r\nescape. In one year millions of these fish are caught, and yet the roes\r\nof only a small number would be sufficient to supply as many fish\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nSoon our fishery was in operation. Jack and Fritz stood in the water\r\nwith baskets, and baled out the fish, as one bales water with a bucket,\r\nthrowing them to us on the shore. As quickly as possible we cleaned\r\nthem, and placed them in casks with salt, first a layer of salt, and\r\nthen a layer of herrings, and so on, until we had ready many casks of\r\npickled fish.\r\n\r\nAs the barrels were filled, we closed them carefully, and rolled them\r\naway to the cool vaults at the back of our cave.\r\n\r\nOur good fortune, however, was not to end here. A day after the herring\r\nfishery was over, and the shoal had left our bay, a great number of\r\nseals appeared, attracted by the refuse of the herrings which we had\r\nthrown into the sea. Though I feared they would not be suitable for our\r\ntable, we yet secured a score or two for the sake of their skins and\r\nfat. The skins we drew carefully off for harness and clothing, and the\r\nfat we boiled down for oil, which we put aside in casks for tanning,\r\nsoap-making, and burning in lamps.\r\n\r\nThese occupations interfered for some time with our work at Rock House;\r\nbut as soon as possible we again returned to our labor with renewed\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nI had noticed that the salt crystals had for their base a species of\r\ngypsum, which I knew might be made of great service to us in our\r\nbuilding operations as plaster.\r\n\r\nAs an experiment, I broke off some pieces, and, after subjecting them to\r\ngreat heat, reduced them to powder. The plaster this formed with water\r\nwas smooth and white, and as I had then no particular use to which I\r\nmight put it, I plastered over some of the herring casks, that I might\r\nbe perfectly certain that all air was excluded. The remainder of the\r\ncasks I left as they were, for I presently intended to preserve their\r\ncontents by smoking. To do this, the boys and I built a small hut of\r\nreeds and branches, and then we strung our herrings on lines across the\r\nroof. On the floor we lit a great fire of brushwood and moss, which\r\nthrew out a dense smoke, curling in volumes round the fish, and they in\r\na few days seemed perfectly cured.\r\n\r\nAbout a month after the appearance of the herrings, we were favored by a\r\nvisit from other shoals of fish. Jack espied them first, and called to\r\nus that a lot of young whales were off the coast. We ran down and\r\ndiscovered the bay apparently swarming with great sturgeons, salmon, and\r\ntrout, all making for the mouth of Jackal River, that they might ascend\r\nit and deposit their spawn among the stones.\r\n\r\nJack was delighted at his discovery.\r\n\r\n"Here are proper fish!" he exclaimed; "none of your paltry fry. How do\r\nyou preserve these sorts of fish? Potted, salted, or smoked?"\r\n\r\n"Not so fast," said I, "not so fast; tell me how they are to be caught,\r\nand I will tell you how they are to be cooked."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'ll catch them fast enough," he replied, and darted off to Rock\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still puzzling my brains as to how I should set to work, he\r\nreturned with his fishing apparatus in hand; a bow and arrow, and a ball\r\nof twine.\r\n\r\nAt the arrow-head he had fastened a barbed spike, and had secured the\r\narrow to the end of the string. Armed with this weapon, he advanced to\r\nthe river\'s edge.\r\n\r\nHis arrow flew from the bow, and, to my surprise, struck one of the\r\nlargest fish in the side.\r\n\r\n"Help, father, help!" he cried, as the great fish darted off, carrying\r\narrow and all with it; "help! or he will pull me into the water."\r\n\r\nI ran to his assistance, and together we struggled with the finny\r\nmonster. He pulled tremendously, and lashed the water around him; but we\r\nheld the cord fast, and he had no chance of escape. Weaker and weaker\r\ngrew his struggles, and, at length, exhausted by his exertions and loss\r\nof blood, he allowed us to draw him ashore.\r\n\r\nHe was a noble prize, and Fritz and Ernest, who came up just as we\r\ncompleted his capture, were quite envious of Jack\'s success. Not to be\r\nbehindhand, they eagerly rushed off for weapons themselves.\r\n\r\nWe were soon all in the water, Fritz with a harpoon, Ernest with a rod\r\nand line, and I myself, armed, like Neptune, with an iron trident, or\r\nmore properly speaking, perhaps, a pitchfork. Soon the shore was strewn\r\nwith a goodly number of the finest fish--monster after monster we drew\r\nto land. At length Fritz, after harpooning a great sturgeon full eight\r\nfeet long, could not get the fish ashore; we all went to his assistance,\r\nbut our united efforts were unavailing.\r\n\r\n"The buffalo!" proposed my wife, and off went Jack for Storm. Storm was\r\nharnessed to the harpoon rope, and soon the monstrous fish lay panting\r\non the sand.\r\n\r\nWe at length, when we had captured as many fish as we could possibly\r\nutilize, set about cleaning and preparing their flesh. Some we salted,\r\nsome we dried like the herrings, some we treated like the tunny of the\r\nMediterranean--we prepared them in oil. Of the roe of the sturgeon I\r\ndecided to form caviare, the great Russian dish. I removed from it all\r\nthe membranes by which it is surrounded, washed it in vinegar, salted\r\nit, pressed out all the moisture caused by the wet-absorbing properties\r\nof the salt, packed it in small barrels, and stowed it away in our\r\nstorehouse.\r\n\r\nI knew that of the sturgeon\'s bladder the best isinglass is made, so\r\ncarefully collecting the air-bladders from all those we had killed, I\r\nwashed them and hung them up to stiffen. The outer coat or membrane I\r\nthen peeled off, cutting the remainder into strips, technically called\r\nstaples. These staples I placed in an iron pot over the fire, and when\r\nthey had been reduced to a proper consistency I strained off the glue\r\nthrough a clean cloth, and spread it out on a slab of stone in thin\r\nlayers, letting them remain until they were dry. The substance I thus\r\nobtained was beautifully transparent, and promised to serve as an\r\nexcellent substitute for glass in our window-frames.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in this beautiful climate little or no attention was\r\nnecessary to the kitchen garden, the seeds sprang up and nourished\r\nwithout apparently the slightest regard for the time or season of the\r\nyear. Peas, beans, wheat, barley, rye, and Indian corn seemed constantly\r\nripe, while cucumbers, melons, and all sorts of other vegetables grew\r\nluxuriantly. The success of our garden at Tentholm encouraged me to hope\r\nthat my experiment at Falconhurst had not failed, and one morning we\r\nstarted to visit the spot.\r\n\r\nAs we passed by the field from which the potatoes had been dug, we found\r\nit covered with barley, wheat, rye, and peas in profusion.\r\n\r\nI turned to the mother in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Where has this fine crop sprung from?" said I.\r\n\r\n"From the earth," she replied laughing, "where Franz and I sowed the\r\nseed I brought from the wreck. The ground was ready tilled by you and\r\nthe boys; all we had to do was to scatter the seed."\r\n\r\nI was delighted at the sight, and it augured well, I thought, for the\r\nsuccess of my maize plantation. We hurried to the field. The crop had\r\nindeed grown well, and, what was more, appeared to be duly appreciated.\r\nA tremendous flock of feathered thieves rose as we approached. Among\r\nthem Fritz espied a few ruffed grouse, and, quick as thought, unhooding\r\nhis eagle, he started him off in chase, then sprung on his onager and\r\nfollowed at full gallop. His noble bird marked out the finest grouse,\r\nand, soaring high above it, stooped and bore his prey to the ground.\r\nFritz was close at hand, and springing through the bushes he saved the\r\nbird from death, hooded the eagle\'s eyes, and returned triumphantly.\r\nJack had not stood idle, for slipping his pet, Fangs, he had started him\r\namong some quails who remained upon the field, and to my surprise the\r\njackal secured some dozen of the birds, bringing them faithfully to his\r\nmaster\'s feet.\r\n\r\nWe then turned our steps toward Falconhurst, where we were refreshed by\r\na most delicious drink the mother prepared for us: the stems of the\r\nyoung Indian corn, crushed, strained, and mixed with water and the juice\r\nof the sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nWe then made preparations for an excursion the following day, for I\r\nwished to establish a sort of semi-civilized farm at some distance from\r\nFalconhurst, where we might place some of our animals, which had become\r\ntoo numerous with our limited means to supply them with food. In the\r\nlarge cart, to which we harnessed the buffalo, cow, and ass, we placed a\r\ndozen fowls, four young pigs, two couple of sheep, and as many goats,\r\nand a pair of hens and one cock grouse. Fritz led the way on his onager,\r\nand by a new track we forced a passage through the woods and tall\r\ngrasses toward Cape Disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe difficult march was at length over, and we emerged from the forest\r\nupon a large plain covered with curious little bushes; the branches of\r\nthese little shrubs and the ground about them were covered with pure\r\nwhite flakes.\r\n\r\n"Snow! snow!" exclaimed Franz. "Oh, mother, come down from the cart and\r\nplay snowballs. This is jolly; much better than the ugly rain."\r\n\r\nI was not surprised at the boy\'s mistake, for indeed the flakes did look\r\nlike snow; but before I could express my opinion, Fritz declared that\r\nthe plant must be a kind of dwarf cotton tree. We approached nearer and\r\nfound he was right--soft fine wool inclosed in pods, and still hanging\r\non the bushes or lying on the ground, abounded in every direction. We\r\nhad indeed discovered this valuable plant. The mother was charmed; and\r\ngathering a great quantity in three capacious bags, we resumed our\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nCrossing the cotton field we ascended a pretty wooded hill. The view\r\nfrom the summit was glorious: luxuriant grass at our feet stretching\r\ndown the hillside, dotted here and there with shady trees, among which\r\ngushed down a sparkling brook, while below lay the rich green forest,\r\nwith the sea beyond.\r\n\r\nWhat better situation could we hope to find for our new farm? Pasture,\r\nwater, shade, and shelter, all were here.\r\n\r\nWe pitched our tent, built our fireplace, and leaving the mother to\r\nprepare our repast, Fritz and I selected a spot for the erection of our\r\nshed. We soon found a group of trees so situated that the trunks would\r\nserve as posts for our intended building. Thither we carried all our\r\ntools, and then, as the day was far advanced, enjoyed our supper, and\r\nlay down upon most comfortable beds, which the mother had prepared for\r\nus with the cotton.\r\n\r\nThe group of trees we had selected was exactly suited to our purpose,\r\nfor it formed a regular rectilinear figure, the greatest side of which\r\nfaced the sea. I cut deep mortices in the trunks about ten feet from the\r\nground, and again ten feet higher up to form a second story. In these\r\nmortices I inserted beams, thus forming a framework for my building, and\r\nthen, making a roof of laths, I overlaid it with bark, which I stripped\r\nfrom a neighboring tree, and fixed with acacia thorns, and which would\r\neffectually shoot off any amount of rain.\r\n\r\nWhile clearing up the scraps of bark and other rubbish for fuel for our\r\nfire, I noticed a peculiar smell, and stooping down I picked up pieces\r\nof the bark, some of which, to my great surprise, I found was that of\r\nthe terebinth tree, and the rest that of the American fir. The goats,\r\ntoo, made an important discovery among the same heap, for we found them\r\nbusily rooting out pieces of cinnamon, a most delicious and aromatic\r\nspice.\r\n\r\n"From the fir," said I to the boys, "we get turpentine and tar, and thus\r\nit is that the fir tree becomes such a valuable article of commerce. So\r\nwe may look forward to preparing pitch for our yacht, with tar and oil,\r\nyou know, and cart-grease, too, with tar and fat. I do not know that you\r\nwill equally appreciate the terebinth tree. A gum issues from incisions\r\nin the bark which hardens in the sun, and becomes as transparent as\r\namber; when burned it gives forth a most delicious perfume, and when\r\ndissolved in spirits of wine, forms a beautiful transparent varnish."\r\n\r\nThe completion of our new farmhouse occupied us several days; we wove\r\nstrong lianas and other creepers together to form the walls to the\r\nheight of about six feet; the rest, up to the roof, we formed merely of\r\na latticework of laths to admit both air and light. Within we divided\r\nthe house into three parts; one subdivided into stalls for the animals;\r\na second fitted with perches for the birds, and a third, simply\r\nfurnished with a rough table and benches, to serve as a sleeping\r\napartment for ourselves, when we should find it necessary to pay the\r\nplace a visit. In a short time the dwelling was most comfortably\r\narranged, and as we daily filled the feeding troughs with the food the\r\nanimals best liked, they showed no inclination to desert the spot we had\r\nchosen for them.\r\n\r\nYet, hard as we had worked, we found that the provisions we had brought\r\nwith us would be exhausted before we could hope to be able to leave the\r\nfarm. I therefore dispatched Jack and Fritz for fresh supplies.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence, Ernest and I made a short excursion in the\r\nneighborhood, that we might know more exactly the character of the\r\ncountry near our farm.\r\n\r\nPassing over a brook which flowed toward the wall of rocks, we reached\r\na large marsh, and as we walked round it, I noticed with delight that it\r\nwas covered with the rice plant growing wild in the greatest profusion.\r\nHere and there only were there any ripe plants, and from these rose a\r\nnumber of ruffed grouse, at which both Ernest and I let fly. Two fell,\r\nand Fangs, who was with us, brought them to our feet. As we advanced,\r\nKnips skipped from the back of his steed Juno and began to regale\r\nhimself on some fruit, at a short distance off; we followed the little\r\nanimal and found him devouring delicious strawberries. Having enjoyed\r\nthe fruit ourselves, we filled the hamper Knips always carried, and\r\nsecured the fruit from his pilfering paws with leaves fixed firmly down.\r\n\r\nI then took a sample of the rice seeds to show the mother, and we\r\ncontinued our journey.\r\n\r\nPresently we reached the borders of the pretty lake which we had seen\r\nbeyond the swamp. The nearer aspect of its calm blue waters greatly\r\ncharmed us, and still more so the sight of numbers of black swans,\r\ndisporting themselves on the glassy surface, in which their stately\r\nforms and graceful movements were reflected as in a mirror. It was\r\ndelightful to watch these splendid birds, old and young, swimming\r\ntogether in the peaceful enjoyment of life, seeking their food, and\r\npursuing one another playfully in the water.\r\n\r\nI could not think of breaking in upon their happy, beautiful existence\r\nby firing among them, but our dog Juno was by no means so considerate;\r\nfor all at once I heard a plunge, and saw her drag out of the water a\r\nmost peculiar-looking creature, something like a small otter, but not\r\nabove twenty-two inches in length, which she would have torn to pieces\r\nhad we not hurried up and taken it from her.\r\n\r\nThis curious little animal was of a soft, dark brown color, the fur\r\nbeing of a lighter shade under the body; its feet were furnished with\r\nlarge claws, and also completely webbed, the head small, with deeply set\r\neyes and ears, and terminating in a broad flat bill like that of a\r\nduck.\r\n\r\nThis singularity seemed to us so droll that we both laughed heartily,\r\nfeeling at the same time much puzzled to know what sort of animal it\r\ncould possibly be. For want of a better, we gave it the name of the\r\n"Beast with a Bill," and Ernest willingly undertook to carry it, that it\r\nmight be stuffed and kept as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nAfter this we returned to the farm, thinking our messengers might soon\r\narrive, and sure enough, in about a quarter of an hour Fritz and Jack\r\nmade their appearance at a brisk trot, and gave a circumstantial account\r\nof their mission.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to see that they had fulfilled their orders intelligently,\r\ncarrying out my intentions in the spirit and not blindly to the letter.\r\n\r\nNext morning we quitted the farm (which we named Woodlands), after\r\nproviding amply for the wants of the animals, sheep, goats, and poultry\r\nwhich we left there.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, on entering a wood, we found it tenanted by an\r\nenormous number of apes, who instantly assailed us, with showers of\r\nfir-cones, uttering hideous and angry cries, and effectually checking\r\nour progress, until we put them to flight by a couple of shots, which\r\nnot a little astonished their weak minds.\r\n\r\nFritz picked up some of their missiles, and, showing them to me, I\r\nrecognized the cone of the stone-pine.\r\n\r\n"By all means gather some of these cones, boys," said I; "you will find\r\nthe kernel has a pleasant taste, like almonds, and from it we can, by\r\npressing, obtain an excellent oil. Therefore I should like to carry some\r\nhome with us."\r\n\r\nA hill, which seemed to promise a good view from its summit, next\r\nattracted my notice, and, on climbing it, we were more than repaid for\r\nthe exertion by the extensive and beautiful prospect which lay spread\r\nbefore our eyes. The situation altogether was so agreeable, that here\r\nalso I resolved to make a settlement, to be visited occasionally, and,\r\nafter resting awhile and talking the matter over, we set to work to\r\nbuild a cottage such as we had lately finished at Woodlands. Our\r\nexperience there enabled us to proceed quickly with the work, and in a\r\nfew days the rustic abode was completed, and received, by Ernest\'s\r\nchoice, the grand name of Prospect Hill.\r\n\r\nMy chief object in undertaking this expedition had been to discover some\r\ntree from whose bark I could hope to make a useful light boat or canoe.\r\nHitherto I had met with none at all fit for my purpose, but, not\r\ndespairing of success, I began, when the cottage was built, to examine\r\ncarefully the surrounding woods, and, after considerable trouble, came\r\nupon two magnificent, tall, straight trees, the bark of which seemed\r\nsomething like that of the birch. Selecting one whose trunk was, to a\r\ngreat height, free from branches, we attached to one of the lower of the\r\nboughs the rope ladder we had with us, and Fritz, ascending it, cut the\r\nbark through in a circle; I did the same at the foot of the tree, and\r\nthen, from between the circle we took a narrow perpendicular slip of\r\nbark entirely out, so that we could introduce the proper tools by which\r\ngradually to loosen and raise the main part, so as finally to separate\r\nit from the tree uninjured and entire. This we found possible, because\r\nthe bark was moist and flexible. Great care and exertion was necessary,\r\nas the bark became detached, to support it, until the whole was ready to\r\nbe let gently down upon the grass. This seemed a great achievement; but\r\nour work was by no means ended, nor could we venture to desist from it\r\nuntil, while the material was soft and pliable, we had formed it into\r\nthe shape we desired for the canoe.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I cut a long triangular piece out of each end of\r\nthe roll, and, placing the sloping parts one over the other, I drew the\r\nends into a pointed form and secured them with pegs and glue.\r\n\r\nThis successful proceeding had, however, widened the boat, and made it\r\ntoo flat in the middle, so that it was necessary to put ropes round it,\r\nand tighten them until the proper shape was restored before we could\r\nallow it to dry in the sun.\r\n\r\nThis being all I could do without a greater variety of tools, I\r\ndetermined to complete my work in a more convenient situation, and\r\nforthwith dispatched Fritz and Jack with orders to bring the sledge\r\n(which now ran on wheels taken from gun-carriages) that the canoe might\r\nbe transported direct to the vicinity of the harbor at Tentholm.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence I fortunately found some wood naturally curved,\r\njust suited for ribs to support and strengthen the sides of the boat.\r\n\r\nWhen the two lads returned with the sledge, it was time to rest for the\r\nnight; but with early dawn we were again busily at work.\r\n\r\nThe sledge was loaded with the new boat, and everything else we could\r\npack into it, and we turned our steps homeward, finding the greatest\r\ndifficulty, however, in getting our vehicle through the woods. We\r\ncrossed the bamboo swamp, where I cut a fine mast for my boat, and came\r\nat length to a small opening or defile in the ridge of rocks, where a\r\nlittle torrent rushed from its source down into the larger stream\r\nbeyond; here we determined to make a halt, in order to erect a great\r\nearth wall across the narrow gorge, which, being thickly planted with\r\nprickly pear, Indian fig, and every thorny bush we could find, would in\r\ntime form an effectual barrier against the intrusion of wild beasts, the\r\ncliffs being, to the best of our belief, in every other part\r\ninaccessible. For our own convenience we retained a small winding-path\r\nthrough this barrier, concealing and defending it with piles of branches\r\nand thorns, and also we contrived a light drawbridge over the stream, so\r\nthat we rendered the pass altogether a very strong position, should we\r\never have to act on the defensive.\r\n\r\nThis work occupied two days, and continuing on our way, we were glad to\r\nrest at Falconhurst before arriving (quite tired and worn out) at\r\nTentholm.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to recruit our strength after this long and fatiguing\r\nexpedition, and then we vigorously resumed the task of finishing the\r\ncanoe. The arrangements, I flattered myself, were carried out in a\r\nmanner quite worthy of a ship builder; a mast, sails, and paddles were\r\nfitted, but my final touch, although I prized it highly and considered\r\nit a grand and original idea, would no doubt have excited only ridicule\r\nand contempt had it been seen by a naval man. My contrivance was this: I\r\nhad a couple of large air-tight bags made of the skins of the dog-fish,\r\nwell tarred and pitched, inflated, and made fast on each side of the\r\nboat, just above the level of the water. These floats, however much she\r\nmight be loaded, would effectually prevent either the sinking or\r\ncapsizing of my craft.\r\n\r\nI may as well relate in this place what I omitted at the time of its\r\noccurrence. During the rainy season our cow presented us with a\r\nbull-calf, and that there might never be any difficulty in managing him,\r\nI at a very early age pierced his nose and placed a short stick in it,\r\nto be exchanged for a ring when he was old enough. The question now came\r\nto be, who should be his master, and to what should we train him?\r\n\r\n"Why not teach him," said Fritz, "to fight the wild animals, and defend\r\nus, like the fighting bulls of the Hottentots? That would be really\r\nuseful!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I should much prefer a gentle bull to a fighting one!"\r\nexclaimed his mother; "but do you mean to say tame oxen can be taught to\r\nact rationally on the defensive?"\r\n\r\n"I can but repeat what I have heard or read," replied I, as regards the\r\nrace of Hottentots who inhabit the south of Africa, among all sorts of\r\nwild and ferocious animals.\r\n\r\n"The wealth of these people consists solely in their flocks and herds,\r\nand, for their protection, they train their bulls to act as guards.\r\n\r\n"These courageous animals keep the rest from straying away, and when\r\ndanger threatens, they give instant notice of it, drive the herd\r\ntogether in a mass, the calves and young cows being placed in the\r\ncenter; around them the bulls and strong oxen make a formidable circle\r\nwith their horned heads turned to the front, offering determined\r\nresistance to the fiercest foe.\r\n\r\n"These fighting bulls will even sometimes rush with dreadful bellowing\r\nto meet the enemy; and should it be a mighty lion or other strong and\r\ndaring monster, sacrifice their own lives in defense of the herd.\r\n\r\n"It is said that formerly, when Hottentot tribes made war on one\r\nanother, it was not unusual to place a troop of these stout-hearted\r\nwarriors in the van of the little army, when their heroism led to\r\ndecisive victory on one side or the other.\r\n\r\n"But," continued I, "although I can see you are all delighted with my\r\ndescription of these fine, warlike animals, I think we had better train\r\nthis youngster to be a peaceable bull. Who is to have charge of him?"\r\n\r\nErnest thought it would be more amusing to train his monkey than a\r\ncalf. Jack, with the buffalo and his hunting jackal, had quite\r\nenough on his hands. Fritz was content with the onager. Their\r\nmother was voted mistress of the old gray donkey. And I myself\r\nbeing superintendent-in-chief of the whole establishment of\r\nanimals, there remained only little Franz to whose special care the\r\ncalf could be committed.\r\n\r\n"What say you, my boy--will you undertake to look after this little\r\nfellow?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, father!" he replied. "Once you told me about a strong man, I\r\nthink his name was Milo, and he had a tiny calf, and he used to carry it\r\nabout everywhere. It grew bigger and bigger, but still he carried it\r\noften, till at last he grew so strong that when it was quite a great big\r\nox, he could lift it as easily as ever. And so, you see, if I take care\r\nof our wee calf and teach it to do what I like, perhaps when it grows\r\nbig I shall still be able to manage it, and then--oh, papa--do you think\r\nI might ride upon it?"\r\n\r\nI smiled at the child\'s simplicity, and his funny application of the\r\nstory of Milo of Cortona.\r\n\r\n"The calf shall be yours, my boy. Make him as tame as you can, and we\r\nwill see about letting you mount him some day; but remember, he will be\r\na great bull long before you are nearly a man. Now, what will you call\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"Shall I call him Grumble, father? Hear what a low muttering noise he\r\nmakes!"\r\n\r\n"Grumble will do famously."\r\n\r\n"Grumble, Grumble. Oh, it beats your buffalo\'s name hollow, Jack!"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," said he; "why, you can\'t compare the two names. Fancy\r\nmother saying, \'Here comes Franz on Grumble, but Jack _riding on the\r\nStorm_.\' Oh, it sounds sublime!"\r\n\r\nWe named the two puppies Bruno and Fawn, and so ended this important\r\ndomestic business.\r\n\r\nFor two months we worked steadily at our salt-cave, in order to complete\r\nthe necessary arrangement of partition walls, so as to put the rooms and\r\nstalls for the animals in comfortable order for the next long rainy\r\nseason, during which time, when other work would be at a standstill, we\r\ncould carry on many minor details for the improvement of the abode.\r\n\r\nWe leveled the floors first with clay; then spread gravel mixed with\r\nmelted gypsum over that, producing a smooth, hard surface, which did\r\nvery well for most of the apartments; but I was ambitious of having one\r\nor two carpets, and set about making a kind of felt in the following\r\nway:\r\n\r\nI spread out a large piece of sailcloth, and covered it equally all over\r\nwith a strong liquid, made of glue and isinglass, which saturated it\r\nthoroughly. On it we then laid wool and hair from the sheep and goats,\r\nwhich had been carefully cleaned and prepared, and rolled and beat it\r\nuntil it adhered tolerably smoothly to the cloth. Finally it became,\r\nwhen perfectly dry, a covering for the floor of our sitting room by no\r\nmeans to be despised.\r\n\r\nOne morning, just after these labors at the salt-cave were completed,\r\nhappening to awake unusually early, I turned my thoughts, as I lay\r\nwaiting for sunrise, to considering what length of time we had now\r\npassed on this coast, and discovered, to my surprise, that the very next\r\nday would be the anniversary of our escape from the wreck. My heart\r\nswelled with gratitude to the gracious God, who had then granted us\r\ndeliverance, and ever since had loaded us with benefits; and I resolved\r\nto set to-morrow apart as a day of thanksgiving, in joyful celebration\r\nof the occasion.\r\n\r\nMy mind was full of indefinite plans when I rose, and the day\'s work\r\nbegan as usual. I took care that everything should be cleaned, cleared,\r\nand set in order both outside and inside our dwelling; none, however,\r\nsuspecting that there was any particular object in view. Other more\r\nprivate preparations I also made for the next day. At supper I made the\r\ncoming event known to the assembled family.\r\n\r\n"Good people, do you know that to-morrow is a very great and important\r\nday? We shall have to keep it in honor of our merciful escape to this\r\nland, and call it Thanksgiving-Day."\r\n\r\nEvery one was surprised to hear that we had already been twelve months\r\nin the country--indeed, my wife believed I might be mistaken, until I\r\nshowed her how I had calculated regularly ever since the 31st of\r\nJanuary, on which day we were wrecked, by marking off in my almanac the\r\nSundays as they arrived for the remaining eleven months of that year.\r\n\r\n"Since then," I added, "I have counted thirty-one days. This is the 1st\r\nof February. We landed on the 2d, therefore to-morrow is the anniversary\r\nof the day of our escape. As my bookseller has not sent me an almanac\r\nfor the present year, we must henceforth reckon for ourselves."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that will be good fun for us," said Ernest. "We must have a long\r\nstick, like Robinson Crusoe, and cut a notch in it every day, and count\r\nthem up every now and then, to see how the weeks and months and years go\r\nby."\r\n\r\n"That is all very well, if you know for certain the number of days in\r\neach month, and in the year. What do you say, Ernest?"\r\n\r\n"The year contains 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds,"\r\nreturned he promptly.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly correct!" said I, smiling; "but you would get in a mess with\r\nthose spare hours, minutes, and seconds in a year or two, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all! Every four years I would add them all together, make a day,\r\nstick it into February, and call that year leap year."\r\n\r\n"Well done, Professor Ernest! We must elect you astronomer royal in this\r\nour kingdom, and let you superintend and regulate everything connected\r\nwith the lapse of time, clocks and watches included."\r\n\r\nBefore they went to sleep, I could hear my boys whispering among\r\nthemselves, about "father\'s mysterious allusions" to next day\'s festival\r\nand rejoicings; but I offered no explanations, and went to sleep, little\r\nguessing that the rogues had laid a counter-plot, far more surprising\r\nthan my simple plan for their diversion.\r\n\r\nNothing less than roar of artillery startled me from sleep at daybreak\r\nnext morning. I sprang up and found my wife as much alarmed as I was by\r\nthe noise, otherwise I should have been inclined to believe it fancy.\r\n\r\n"Fritz! dress quickly and come with me!" cried I, turning to his\r\nhammock. Lo, it was empty! neither he nor Jack were to be seen.\r\n\r\nAltogether bewildered, I was hastily dressing, when their voices were\r\nheard, and they rushed in shouting:\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! didn\'t we rouse you with a right good thundering salute?"\r\n\r\nBut perceiving at a glance that we had been seriously alarmed, Fritz\r\nhastened to apologize for the thoughtless way in which they had sought\r\nto do honor to the Day of Thanksgiving, without considering that an\r\nunexpected cannon-shot would startle us unpleasantly from our slumbers.\r\n\r\nWe readily forgave the authors of our alarm, in consideration of the\r\ngood intention which had prompted the deed, and, satisfied that the day\r\nhad at least been duly inaugurated, we all went quietly to breakfast.\r\n\r\nAfterward we sat together for a long time, enjoying the calm beauty of\r\nthe morning, and talking of all that had taken place on the memorable\r\ndays of the storm a year ago; for I desired that the awful events of\r\nthat time should live in the remembrance of my children with a deepening\r\nsense of gratitude for our deliverance. Therefore I read aloud passages\r\nfrom my journal, as well as many beautiful verses from the Psalms,\r\nexpressive of joyful praise and thanksgiving, so that even the youngest\r\namong us was impressed and solemnized at the recollections of escape\r\nfrom a terrible death, and also led to bless and praise the name of the\r\nLord our Deliverer.\r\n\r\nDinner followed shortly after this happy service, and I then announced\r\nfor the afternoon a "Grand Display of Athletic Sports," in which I and\r\nmy wife were to be spectators and judges.\r\n\r\n"Father, what a grand idea!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, how jolly! Are we to run races?"\r\n\r\n"And prizes! Will there be prizes, father?"\r\n\r\n"The judges offer prizes for competition in every sort of manly\r\nexercise," replied I. "Shooting, running, riding, leaping, climbing,\r\nswimming; we will have an exhibition of your skill in all. Now for it!"\r\n\r\n"Trumpeters! sound for the opening of the lists."\r\n\r\nUttering these last words in a stentorian voice and wildly waving my\r\narms toward a shady spot, where the ducks and geese were quietly\r\nresting, had the absurd effect I intended.\r\n\r\nUp they all started in a fright, gabbling and quacking loudly, to the\r\ninfinite amusement of the children, who began to bustle about in eager\r\npreparations for the contest, and begging to know with what they were to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\n"Let us have shooting first, and the rest when the heat of the day\r\ndeclines. Here is a mark I have got ready for you," said I, producing a\r\nboard roughly shaped like a kangaroo, and of about the size of one. This\r\ntarget was admired, but Jack could not rest satisfied till he had added\r\nears, and a long leather strap for a tail.\r\n\r\nIt was then fixed in the attitude most characteristic of the creature,\r\nand the distance for firing measured off. Each of the three competitors\r\nwas to fire twice.\r\n\r\nFritz hit the kangaroo\'s head each time; Ernest hit the body once; and\r\nJack, by a lucky chance, shot the ears clean away from the head, which\r\nfeat raised a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\nA second trial with pistols ensued, in which Fritz again came off\r\nvictor.\r\n\r\nThen desiring the competitors to load with small shot, I threw a little\r\nboard as high as I possibly could up in the air, each in turn aiming at\r\nand endeavoring to hit it before it touched the ground.\r\n\r\nIn this I found to my surprise that the sedate Ernest succeeded quite as\r\nwell as his more impetuous brother Fritz.\r\n\r\nAs for Jack, his flying board escaped wholly uninjured.\r\n\r\nAfter this followed archery, which I liked to encourage, foreseeing that\r\na time might come when ammunition would fail; and in this practice I saw\r\nwith pleasure that my elder sons were really skillful, while even little\r\nFranz acquitted himself well.\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, and then I started a running match.\r\n\r\nFritz, Ernest, and Jack were to run to Falconhurst, by the most direct\r\npath. The first to reach the tree was to bring me, in proof of his\r\nsuccess, a penknife I had accidentally left on the table in my sleeping\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAt a given signal, away went the racers in fine style. Fritz and Jack,\r\nputting forth all their powers, took the lead at once, running in\r\nadvance of Ernest, who started at a good, steady pace, which I predicted\r\nhe would be better able to maintain than such a furious rate as his\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nBut long before we expected to see them back, a tremendous noise of\r\ngalloping caused us to look with surprise toward the bridge, and Jack\r\nmade his appearance, thundering along on his buffalo, with the onager\r\nand the donkey tearing after him riderless, and the whole party in the\r\nwildest spirits.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" cried I, "what sort of footrace do you call this, Master Jack?"\r\n\r\nHe shouted merrily as he dashed up to us; then flinging himself off and\r\nsaluting us in a playful way:\r\n\r\n"I very soon saw," said he, "that I hadn\'t a chance; so renouncing all\r\nidea of the prize, I caught Storm, and made him gallop home with me, to\r\nbe in time to see the others come puffing in. Lightfoot and old Grizzle\r\nchose to join me--I never invited them!"\r\n\r\nBy and by the other boys arrived, Ernest holding up the knife in token\r\nof being the winner; and after hearing all particulars about the\r\nrunning, and that he had reached Falconhurst two minutes before Fritz,\r\nwe proceeded to test the climbing powers of the youthful athletes.\r\n\r\nIn this exercise Jack performed wonders. He ascended with remarkable\r\nagility the highest palms whose stems he could clasp. And when he put on\r\nhis shark-skin buskins, which enabled him to take firm hold of larger\r\ntrees, he played antics like a squirrel or a monkey, peeping and\r\ngrinning at us, at first on one side of the stem, and then on the other,\r\nin a most diverting way.\r\n\r\nFritz and Ernest climbed well, but could not come near the grace and\r\nskill of their active and lively young brother.\r\n\r\nRiding followed, and marvelous feats were performed, Fritz and Jack\r\nproving themselves very equal in their management of their different\r\nsteeds.\r\n\r\nI thought the riding was over, when little Franz appeared from the\r\nstable in the cave, leading young Grumble, the bull-calf, with a neat\r\nsaddle of kangaroo hide, and a bridle passed through his nose ring.\r\n\r\nThe child saluted us with a pretty little air of confidence, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Now, most learned judges, prepare to see something quite new and\r\nwonderful! The great bull-tamer, Milo of Cortona, desires the honor of\r\nexhibiting before you."\r\n\r\nThen taking a whip and holding the end of a long cord, he made the\r\nanimal, at the word of command, walk, trot, and gallop in a circle round\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe afterward mounted, and showed off Grumble\'s somewhat awkward paces.\r\n\r\nThe sports were concluded by swimming matches, and the competitors found\r\na plunge in salt water very refreshing after their varied exertions.\r\n\r\nFritz showed himself a master in the art. At home in the element, no\r\nmoment betokened either exertion or weariness.\r\n\r\nErnest exhibited too much anxiety and effort, while Jack was far too\r\nviolent and hasty, and soon became exhausted.\r\n\r\nFranz gave token of future skill.\r\n\r\nBy this time, as it was getting late, we returned to our dwelling, the\r\nmother having preceded us in order to make arrangements for the ceremony\r\nof prize-giving.\r\n\r\nWe found her seated in great state, with the prizes set out by her side.\r\n\r\nThe boys marched in pretending to play various instruments in imitation\r\nof a band, and then all four, bowing respectfully, stood before her,\r\nlike the victors in a tournament of old, awaiting the reward of valor\r\nfrom the Queen of Beauty, which she bestowed with a few words of praise\r\nand encouragement.\r\n\r\nFritz, to his immense delight, received, as the prize for shooting and\r\nswimming, a splendid double-barreled rifle, and a beautiful\r\nhunting-knife.\r\n\r\nTo Ernest, as winner of the running match, was given a handsome gold\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nFor climbing and riding, Jack had a pair of silver plated spurs, and a\r\nriding whip, both of which gave him extraordinary pleasure.\r\n\r\nFranz received a pair of stirrups, and a driving whip made of\r\nrhinoceros hide, which we thought would be of use to him in the\r\ncharacter of bull-trainer.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony was supposed to be over, I advanced, and solemnly\r\npresented to my wife a lovely work-box, filled with every imaginable\r\nrequirement for a lady\'s work-table, which she accepted with equal\r\nsurprise and delight.\r\n\r\nThe whole entertainment afforded the boys such intense pleasure, and\r\ntheir spirits rose to such a pitch, that nothing would serve them but\r\nanother salvo of artillery, in order to close with befitting dignity and\r\nhonor so great a day. They gave me no peace till they had leave to\r\nsquander some gunpowder, and then at last their excited feelings seeming\r\nrelieved, we were able to sit down to supper; shortly afterward we\r\njoined in family worship and retired to rest.\r\n\r\nSoon after the great festival of our grand Thanksgiving-Day I\r\nrecollected that it was now the time when, the figs at Falconhurst being\r\nripe, immense flocks of ortolans and wild pigeons were attracted\r\nthither, and as we had found those preserved last year of the greatest\r\nuse among our stores of winter provisions, I would not miss the\r\nopportunity of renewing our stock; and therefore, laying aside the\r\nbuilding work, we removed with all speed to our home in the tree, where\r\nsure enough we found the first detachment of the birds already busy with\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\nIn order to spare ammunition, I resolved to concoct a strong sort of\r\nbirdlime, of which I had read in some account of the Palm Islanders, who\r\nmake it of fresh caoutchouc mixed with oil, and of so good a quality\r\nthat it has been known to catch even peacocks and turkeys.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack were therefore dispatched to collect some fresh\r\ncaoutchouc from the trees, and as this involved a good gallop on Storm\r\nand Lightfoot, they, nothing loth, set off.\r\n\r\nThey took a supply of calabashes, in which to bring the gum, and we\r\nfound it high time to manufacture a fresh stock of these useful vessels.\r\nI was beginning to propose an expedition to the Gourd-tree Wood,\r\nregretting the time it would take to go such a distance, when my wife\r\nreminded me of her plantation near the potato field.\r\n\r\nThere to our joy we found that all the plants were flourishing, and\r\ncrops of gourds and pumpkins, in all stages of ripeness, covered the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nSelecting a great number suited to our purpose, we hastened home, and\r\nbegan the manufacture of basins, dishes, plates, flasks, and spoons of\r\nall sorts and sizes, with even greater success than before.\r\n\r\nWhen the riders returned with the caoutchouc, they brought several\r\nnovelties besides.\r\n\r\nA crane, for example, shot by Fritz, and an animal which they called a\r\nmarmot, but which to me seemed much more like a badger.\r\n\r\nAniseed, turpentine, and wax berries for candles, they had also\r\ncollected, and a curious root which they introduced by the name of the\r\nmonkey plant.\r\n\r\n"And pray wherefore \'monkey plant,\' may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"Well, for this reason, father," answered Fritz: "we came upon an open\r\nspace in the forest near Woodlands, and perceived a troop of monkeys,\r\napparently engaged, as Jack said, in cultivating the soil! Being curious\r\nto make out what they were at, we tied up the dogs, as well as Storm and\r\nLightfoot, and crept near enough to see that the apes were most\r\nindustriously grubbing up and eating roots. This they did in a way that\r\nnearly choked us with laughter, for when the root was rather hard to\r\npull up, and the leaves were torn off, they seized it firmly in their\r\nteeth, and flung themselves fairly heels-over-head in the most ludicrous\r\nfashion you ever saw, and up came the root, unable to resist the\r\nleverage! Of course we wanted to see what this dainty morsel was like,\r\nso we loosed the dogs, and the apes cleared out double quick, leaving\r\nplenty of the roots about. We tasted them, and thought them very nice.\r\nWill you try one?"\r\n\r\nThe plant was quite new to me, but I imagined it might be what is called\r\nin China "ginseng," and there prized and valued beyond everything. The\r\nchildren being curious to hear more about this ginseng, I continued:\r\n\r\n"In China it is considered so strengthening and wholesome that it is\r\nused as a sort of universal medicine, being supposed to prolong human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"The emperor alone has the right to permit it to be gathered, and guards\r\nare placed round land where it grows.\r\n\r\n"Ginseng is to be found in Tartary, and has lately been discovered in\r\nCanada; it is cultivated in Pennsylvania, because the Americans\r\nintroduce it secretly into China as smuggled merchandise."\r\n\r\nFritz then continued:\r\n\r\n"After this we went on to Woodlands; but mercy on us! what a confusion\r\nthe place was in! Everything smashed or torn, and covered with mud and\r\ndirt; the fowls terrified, the sheep and goats scattered, the contents\r\nof the rooms dashed about as if a whirlwind had swept through the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"What!" I exclaimed, while my wife looked horrified at the news,\r\nconjuring up in her imagination hordes of savages who would soon come\r\nand lay waste Falconhurst and Tentholm as well as Woodlands. "How can\r\nthat have happened? Did you discover the authors of all this mischief?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Jack, "it was easy to see that those dreadful monkeys had\r\ndone it all. First they must have got into the yards and sheds, and\r\nhunted the fowls and creatures about; and then I dare say the cunning\r\nrascals put a little monkey in at some small opening, and bid him\r\nunfasten the shutters--you know what nimble fingers they have. Then of\r\ncourse the whole _posse_ of them swarmed into our nice tidy cottage and\r\nskylarked with every single thing they could lay paws on, till perhaps\r\nthey got hungry all at once, and bethought them of the \'ginseng,\' as you\r\ncall it, out in the woods yonder, where we found them so busy refreshing\r\nthemselves, the mischievous villains!"\r\n\r\n"While we were gazing at all this ruin in a sort of bewilderment,"\r\npursued Fritz, "we heard a sound of rushing wings and strange ringing\r\ncries, as of multitudes of birds passing high above us, and looking up\r\nwe perceived them flying quickly in a wedge-shaped flock at a great\r\nheight in the air. They began gradually to descend, taking the direction\r\nof the lake, and separated into a number of small detachments, which\r\nfollowed in a long, straight line, and at a slower rate, the movements\r\nof the leaders, who appeared to be examining the neighborhood. We could\r\nnow see what large birds they must be, but dared not show ourselves or\r\nfollow them, lest they should take alarm.\r\n\r\n"Presently, and with one accord, they quickened their motion, just as if\r\nthe band had begun to play a quick march after a slow one, and rapidly\r\ndescended to earth in a variety of lively ways, and near enough for us\r\nto see that they must be cranes.\r\n\r\n"Some alighted at once, while others hovered sportively over them. Many\r\ndarted to the ground, and, just touching it, would soar again upward\r\nwith a strong but somewhat heavy flight.\r\n\r\n"After gamboling in this way for a time, the whole multitude, as though\r\nat the word of command, alighted on the rice fields, and began to feast\r\non the fresh grain.\r\n\r\n"We thought now was our time to get a shot at the cranes, and cautiously\r\napproached; but they were too cunning to let themselves be surprised,\r\nand we came unexpectedly upon their out-posts or sentinels, who\r\ninstantly sprang into the air, uttering loud, trumpet-like cries, upon\r\nwhich the whole flock arose and followed them with a rush like a sudden\r\nsquall of wind. We were quite startled, and it was useless to attempt a\r\nshot; but unwilling to miss the chance of securing at least one of the\r\nbirds, I hastily unhooded my eagle, and threw him into the air.\r\n\r\n"With a piercing cry he soared away high above them, then shot downward\r\nlike an arrow, causing wild confusion among the cranes. The one which\r\nthe eagle attacked sought to defend itself; a struggle followed, and\r\nthey came together to the ground not far from where we stood.\r\n\r\n"Hastening forward, to my grief I found the beautiful crane already\r\ndead. The eagle, luckily unhurt, was rewarded with a small pigeon from\r\nmy game-bag.\r\n\r\n"After this we went back to Woodlands, got some turpentine and a bag of\r\nrice--and set off for home."\r\n\r\nFritz\'s interesting story being ended, and supper ready, we made trial\r\nof the new roots, and found them very palatable, either boiled or\r\nstewed; the monkey plant, however, if it really proved to be the ginseng\r\nof the Chinese, would require to be used with caution, being of an\r\naromatic and heating nature.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to transplant a supply of both roots to our kitchen garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n Birdlime--A midnight raid--The massacre at Woodlands--Capture of\r\n     Molucca pigeons--A pigeon-house--Fritz and I prepare a conjuring\r\n     trick--Great success of our experiment--Lichen and nutmegs\r\n     discovered--Jack\'s adventure--The loom manufactured--Winter stores\r\n     prepared--The rainy season sets in--Interior of our house\r\n     arranged--We study languages--The return of spring--A stranded\r\n     whale--An account of coral--We go to work on the whale\'s\r\n     carcass--Remarks on the habits of the whale.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we were early astir; and as soon as breakfast\r\nwas over, we went regularly to work with the birdlime. The tough,\r\nadhesive mixture of caoutchouc, oil, and turpentine turned out well.\r\n\r\nThe boys brought rods, which I smeared over, and made them place among\r\nthe upper branches, where the fruit was plentiful, and the birds most\r\ncongregated.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious number of the pigeons, far beyond those of last year,\r\nreminded me that we had not then, as now, witnessed their arrival at\r\ntheir feeding-places, but had seen only the last body of the season, a\r\nmere party of stragglers, compared to the masses which now weighed down\r\nthe branches of all the trees in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe sweet acorns of the evergreen oaks were also patronized; large\r\nflocks were then congregated; and from the state of the ground under the\r\ntrees it was evident that at night they roosted on the branches. Seeing\r\nthis, I determined to make a raid upon them by torchlight, after the\r\nmanner of the colonists in Virginia.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the birdlime acted well: the pigeons alighting, stuck fast.\r\nThe more they fluttered and struggled, the more completely were they\r\nbedaubed with the tenacious mixture, and at length, with piteous cries,\r\nfell to the ground, bearing the sticks with them. The birds were then\r\nremoved, fresh lime spread, and the snare set again.\r\n\r\nThe boys quickly became able to carry on the work without my assistance;\r\nso, leaving it to them, I went to prepare torches, with pine wood and\r\nturpentine, for the night attack.\r\n\r\nJack presently brought a very pretty pigeon, unlike the rest, to show\r\nme, as he felt unwilling to kill it; and seeing that it must be one of\r\nour own European breed, which we wished to preserve until their numbers\r\ngreatly increased, I took the trembling captive, and gently cleansed its\r\nfeet and wings with oil and ashes from the stiff, sticky mess with which\r\nit was bedaubed, placing it then in a wicker cage, and telling Jack to\r\nbring me any others like it which were caught. This he did; and we\r\nsecured several pairs, greatly to my satisfaction, as having necessarily\r\nlet them go free when we landed, they had become quite wild and we\r\nderived no advantage from them: whereas now we would have a cot, and\r\npigeon-pie whenever we liked.\r\n\r\nWhen evening drew on, we set out for the wood of sweet acorns, provided\r\nmerely with long bamboo canes, torches, and canvas sacks.\r\n\r\nThese weapons appeared very curious and insufficient to the children;\r\nbut their use was speedily apparent; for darkness having come upon us\r\nalmost before we reached the wood, I lighted the torches, and perceived,\r\nas I expected, that every branch was thickly laden with ortolans and\r\nwild pigeons, who were roosting there in amazing numbers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly aroused by the glare of light, confusion prevailed among the\r\nterrified birds, who fluttered helplessly through the branches, dazzled\r\nand bewildered, and many falling, even before we began to use the\r\nsticks, were picked up, and put in the bags. When we beat and struck the\r\nbranches, it was as much as my wife and Franz could do to gather up the\r\nquantities of pigeons that soon lay on the ground. The sacks were\r\nspeedily quite full. We turned homeward, and on reaching Falconhurst,\r\nput our booty in safety, and gladly withdrew to rest.\r\n\r\nThe following day was wholly occupied in plucking, boiling, roasting,\r\nand stewing, so that we could find time for nothing else; but next\r\nmorning a great expedition to Woodlands was arranged, that measures\r\nmight there be taken to prevent a repetition of the monkey invasion.\r\n\r\nI hoped, could I but catch the mischievous rascals at their work of\r\ndestruction, to inflict upon them such a chastisement as would\r\neffectually make them shun the neighborhood of our farm for the future.\r\n\r\nMy wife provided us with a good store of provisions, as we were likely\r\nto be absent several days, while she, with Franz and Turk, remained at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nI took with me abundance of specially prepared birdlime, far stronger\r\nthan that which we used for the pigeons; a number of short posts, plenty\r\nof string, and a supply of cocoanut shells and gourds.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo carried all these things, and one or two of the boys beside.\r\nI myself bestrode the ass, and in due time we arrived at a convenient\r\nspot in the forest, near Woodlands, well concealed by thick bushes and\r\nunderwood, where we made a little encampment, pitching the small tent,\r\nand tethering the animals. The dogs, too, were tied up, lest they should\r\nroam about and betray our presence.\r\n\r\nWe found the cottage quiet and deserted; and I lost no time in preparing\r\nfor the reception of visitors, hoping to be all ready for them and out\r\nof sight before they arrived.\r\n\r\nWe drove the stakes lightly into the ground, so as to form an irregular\r\npaling round the house, winding string in and out in all directions\r\nbetween them thus making a kind of labyrinth, through which it would be\r\nimpossible to pass without touching either the stakes or the cords.\r\n\r\nEverything was plentifully besmeared with birdlime, and basins of the\r\nmixture were set in all directions, strewn with rice, maize, and other\r\ndainties for bait.\r\n\r\nNight came without any interruption to our proceedings; and all being\r\nthen accomplished, we retired to rest beneath the shelter of our little\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nVery early in the morning we heard a confused noise, such as we knew\r\nbetokened the approach of a large number of apes. We armed ourselves\r\nwith strong clubs and cudgels, and holding the dogs in leash, made our\r\nway silently behind the thickets, till, ourselves unseen, we could\r\ncommand a view of all that went on; and strange indeed was the scene\r\nwhich ensued!\r\n\r\nThe noise of rustling, cracking, and creaking among the branches, with\r\nhorrid cries, and shrieks, and chattering, increased to a degree\r\nsufficient to make us perfectly giddy; and then out from the forest\r\npoured the whole disorderly rabble of monkeys, scrambling, springing,\r\nleaping from the trees, racing and tumbling across the grassy space\r\ntoward the house; when, at once attracted by the novelties they saw,\r\nthey made for the jars and bowls.\r\n\r\nThey saw innumerable; but the confused, rapid way in which they swarmed\r\nhither and thither, made it difficult to judge accurately of their\r\nnumbers. They dashed fearlessly through and over the palings in all\r\ndirections, some rushing at the eatables, some scrambling on to the\r\nroof, where they commenced tugging at the wooden pegs, with a view to\r\nforcing an entrance.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, as they rambled over the place, all in turn became\r\nbesmeared with our birdlime on head, paws, or back or breast. The\r\nwretched predicament of the apes increased every instant.\r\n\r\nSome sat down, and with the most ludicrous gestures, tried to clean\r\nthemselves. Others were hopelessly entangled in stakes and cordage,\r\nwhich they trailed about after them, looking the picture of bewildered\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, endeavored to help one another, and stuck fast together;\r\nthe more they pulled, and tugged, and kicked the worse became their\r\nplight.\r\n\r\nMany had the gourds and cocoanut shells lumbering and clattering about\r\nwith them, their paws having been caught when they sought to obtain the\r\nrice or fruit we had put for bait.\r\n\r\nMost ridiculous of all was the condition of one old fellow, who had\r\nfound a calabash containing palm wine, and, eagerly drinking it, was\r\nimmediately fitted with a mask, for the shell stuck to his forehead and\r\nwhiskers, of course covering his eyes; and he blundered about, cutting\r\nthe wildest capers in his efforts to get rid of the encumbrance.\r\n\r\nNumbers took to flight; but, as we had spread birdlime on several of the\r\ntrees around, many apes found themselves fixed to, or hanging from the\r\nbranches, where they remained in woeful durance, struggling and\r\nshrieking horribly.\r\n\r\nThe panic being now general, I loosed the three dogs, whose impatience\r\nhad been almost uncontrollable, and who now rushed to the attack of the\r\nunfortunate monkeys, as though burning with zeal to execute justice upon\r\ndesperate criminals.\r\n\r\nThe place soon had the appearance of a ghastly battlefield; for we were\r\nobliged to do our part with the clubs and sticks, till the din of\r\nhowling, yelling, barking, in every conceivable tone of rage and pain,\r\ngave place to an awful silence, and we looked with a shudder on the\r\nshocking spectacle around us.\r\n\r\nAt least forty apes lay mangled and dead, and the boys began to be quite\r\nsad and down-hearted, till I, fully sharing their feelings, hastened to\r\nturn their thoughts to active employment in removing and burying the\r\nslain, burning the stakes, cordage, bowls, everything concerned in the\r\nexecution of our deadly stratagem.\r\n\r\nAfter that we betook ourselves to the task of restoring order to our\r\ndismantled cottage; and seeking for the scattered flock of sheep, goats,\r\nand poultry, we gradually collected them, hoping to settle them once\r\nmore peacefully, in their yards and sheds.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged, we repeatedly heard a sound as of something heavy\r\nfalling from a tree. On going to look, we found three splendid birds,\r\ncaught on some of the limed sticks we had placed loose in the branches.\r\n\r\nTwo of these proved to be a variety of the blue Molucca pigeon; the\r\nthird I assumed to be the Nicobar pigeon, having met with descriptions\r\nof its resplendent green, bronze, and steely blue plumage; and I was\r\npleased to think of domesticating them, and establishing them as first\r\ntenants of a suitable dwelling near the cave.\r\n\r\n"First tenants, father!" said Fritz; "do you expect to catch more like\r\nthese?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly catch them; I mean to practise a secret art. Much can be\r\ndone by magic, Fritz!"\r\n\r\nFurther explanation I declined to give.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Woodlands was once more set in order, and everything\r\nsettled and comfortable, so that we returned without further adventure\r\nto Falconhurst, where we were joyfully welcomed.\r\n\r\nEvery one agreed that we must go at once to Tentholm, to make the\r\nproposed pigeon-house in the rock. Several other things there also\r\nrequiring our attention, we made arrangements for a prolonged stay.\r\n\r\nMy plan for the pigeon-house was to hollow out an ample space in the\r\ncliff, facing toward Jackal River, and close to our rocky home, fitting\r\nthat up with partitions, perches, and nesting places; while a large\r\nwooden front was fitted on to the opening, with entrance-holes, slides\r\nor shutters, and a broad platform in front, where the birds could rest\r\nand walk about.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the work of a few weeks, we thought it was fit for\r\nhabitation, I set the other children to work at some distance from our\r\ncavern, and summoning Fritz:\r\n\r\n"Now, my faithful assistant," said I, "it is time to conjure the new\r\ncolonists to their settlement here. Yes," I continued, laughing at his\r\npuzzled look, "I mean to play a regular pigeon-dealer\'s trick. You must\r\nknow such gentry are very ingenious, not only in keeping their own\r\npigeons safe, but in adding to their numbers by attracting those of\r\nother people. All I want is some soft clay, aniseed, and salt, of which\r\nI will compound a mixture which our birds will like very much, and the\r\nsmell of which will bring others to share it with them."\r\n\r\n"I can easily get you those things, father."\r\n\r\n"I shall want some oil of aniseed besides," said I, "to put on the\r\npigeon-holes, so that the birds\' feathers may touch it as they may pass\r\nin and out, and become scented with what will attract the wild pigeons.\r\nThis I can obtain by pounding aniseed; therefore, bring me the mortar\r\nand some oil."\r\n\r\nWhen this was strongly impregnated with the aromatic oil from the seeds\r\n(for I did not propose to distill it in regular style), I strained it\r\nthrough a cloth, pressing it strongly; the result answered my purpose,\r\nand the scent would certainly remain for some days.\r\n\r\nAll my preparations being completed, the pigeons were installed in their\r\nnew residence, and the slides closed. The European birds were by this\r\ntime quite friendly with the three beautiful strangers; and when the\r\nother boys came home, and scrambled up the ladder to peep in at a little\r\npane of glass I had fixed in front, they saw them all contentedly\r\npicking up grain, and pecking at the "magic food," as Fritz called it,\r\nalthough he did not betray my secret arts to his brothers.\r\n\r\nEarly on the third morning I aroused Fritz, and directed him to ascend\r\nthe rope ladder, and arrange a cord on the sliding door of the dovecot,\r\nby which it could be opened or closed from below. Also he poured fresh\r\naniseed oil all about the entrance, after which we returned, and awoke\r\nthe rest of the family, telling them that if they liked to make haste,\r\nthey might see me let the pigeons fly.\r\n\r\nEverybody came to the dovecot, understanding that some ceremony was to\r\nattend the event, and I waved a wand with mock solemnity, while I\r\nmuttered a seeming incantation, and then gave Fritz a sign to draw up\r\nthe sliding panel.\r\n\r\nPresently out popped the pretty heads of the captives, the soft eyes\r\nglanced about in all directions; they withdrew, they ventured forth\r\nagain, they came timidly out on "the veranda," as little Franz expressed\r\nit; then, as though suddenly startled, the whole party took wing, with\r\nthe shrill whizzing sound peculiar to the flight of pigeons, and\r\ncircling above us as they rose higher and higher, finally darting quite\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\nWhile we were yet gazing after them, they reappeared, and settled\r\nquietly on the dovecot; but as we congratulated ourselves on a return\r\nwhich showed that they accepted this as a home, up sprang the three blue\r\npigeons, the noble foreigners, for whom chiefly I had planned the house,\r\nand rising in circles high in air, winged their rapid way direct toward\r\nFalconhurst.\r\n\r\nTheir departure had such an air of determination and resolve about it,\r\nthat I feared them lost to us forever.\r\n\r\nEndeavoring to console ourselves by petting our four remaining birds, we\r\ncould not forget this disappointment, and all day long the dovecot\r\nremained the center of attraction.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was seen of the fugitive until about the middle of the\r\nnext day; when most of us were hard at work inside the cavern, Jack\r\nsprang in full of excitement, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"He is there! He is come! he really is!"\r\n\r\n"Who? Who is there? What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"The blue pigeon, to be sure! Hurrah! Hurrah!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense!" said Ernest. "You want to play us a trick."\r\n\r\n"Why should it be \'nonsense\'?" cried I. "I fully believe we shall see\r\nthem all soon!"\r\n\r\nOut ran everybody to the dovecot, and there, sure enough stood the\r\npretty fellow, but not alone, for he was billing and cooing to a mate, a\r\nstranger of his own breed, apparently inviting her to enter his\r\ndwelling; for he popped in and out of the door, bowing, sidling, and\r\ncooing, in a most irresistible manner, until the shy little lady\r\nyielded to his blandishments, and tripped daintily in. "Now, let\'s shut\r\nthe door."\r\n\r\n"Pull the cord and close the panel!" shouted the boys, making a rush at\r\nthe string.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" cried I, "let the string alone! I won\'t have you frighten the\r\nlittle darlings. Besides, the others will be coming--would you shut the\r\ndoor in their faces?"\r\n\r\n"Here they come! here they come!" exclaimed Fritz, whose keen eye marked\r\nthe birds afar, and to our delight the second blue pigeon arrived,\r\nlikewise with a mate, whom, after a pretty little flirtation scene of\r\nreal and assumed modesty on her part, he succeeded in leading home.\r\n\r\nThe third and handsomest of the new pigeons was the last in making his\r\nappearance. Perhaps he had greater difficulty than the others in finding\r\na mate as distinguished in rank and beauty as himself.\r\n\r\nHowever, we fully expected them, and the boys talked of the arrival of\r\n"Mr. and Mrs. Nicobar" as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nLate in the day Franz and his mother went out to provide for supper, but\r\nthe child returned directly, exclaiming that we must hasten to the\r\ndovecot to see something beautiful.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a general rush was made out of the cave, and we saw with\r\ndelight that the third stranger also had returned with a lovely bride,\r\nand encouraged by the presence of the first arrivals, they soon made\r\nthemselves at home.\r\n\r\nIn a short time nest-building commenced, and among the materials\r\ncollected by the birds, I observed a long gray moss or lichen, and\r\nthought it might very possibly be the same which, in the West Indies, is\r\ngathered from the bark of old trees, where it grows, and hangs in great\r\ntuft-like beards, to be used instead of horse-hair for stuffing\r\nmattresses.\r\n\r\nMy wife no sooner heard of it than her active brain devised fifty plans\r\nfor making it of use. Would we but collect enough, she would clean and\r\nsort it, and there would be no end to the bolsters, pillows, saddles,\r\nand cushions she would stuff with it.\r\n\r\nFor the discovery of nutmegs we had also to thank the pigeons, and they\r\nwere carefully planted in our orchard.\r\n\r\nFor some time no event of particular note occurred, until at length\r\nJack, as usual, got into a scrape, causing thereby no little excitement\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nHe went off early on one of his own particular private expeditions.\r\n\r\nHe was in the habit of doing this that he might surprise us with some\r\nnew acquisition on his return.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, he came back in most wretched plight, covered with\r\nmud and green slime; a great bundle of Spanish canes was on his back,\r\nmuddy and green like himself; he had lost a shoe, and altogether\r\npresented a ludicrous picture of misery, at which we could have laughed\r\nhad he not seemed more ready to cry!\r\n\r\n"My dear boy! what has happened to you? Where have you been?"\r\n\r\n"Only in the swamp behind the powder magazine, father," replied he. "I\r\nwent to get reeds for my wicker-work, because I wanted to weave some\r\nbaskets and hencoops, and I saw such beauties a little way off in the\r\nmarsh, much finer than those close by the edge, that I tried to get at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"I jumped from one firm spot to another, till at last I slipped and sank\r\nover my ankles; I tried to get on toward the reeds, which were close by,\r\nbut in I went deeper and deeper, till I was above the knees in thick\r\nsoft mud, and there I stuck!\r\n\r\n"I screamed and shouted, but nobody came, and I can tell you I was in a\r\nregular fright.\r\n\r\n"At last who should appear but my faithful Fangs! He knew my voice and\r\ncame close up to me, right over the swamp, but all the poor beast could\r\ndo was to help me to make a row; I wonder you did not hear us! The very\r\nrocks rang, but nothing came of it, so despair drove me to think of an\r\nexpedient. I cut down all the reeds I could reach round and round me,\r\nand bound them together into this bundle, which made a firm place on\r\nwhich to lean, while I worked and kicked about to free my feet and legs,\r\nand after much struggling, I managed to get astride on the reeds.\r\n\r\n"There I sat, supported above the mud and slime, while Fangs ran yelping\r\nbackward and forward between me and the bank, seeming surprised I did\r\nnot follow. Suddenly I thought of catching hold of his tail. He dragged\r\nand pulled, and I sprawled, and crawled, and waded, sometimes on my\r\nreeds like a raft, sometimes lugging them along with me, till we luckily\r\ngot back to terra firma. But I had a near squeak for it, I can tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"A fortunate escape indeed, my boy!" cried I, "and I thank God for it.\r\nFangs has really acted a heroic part as your deliverer, and you have\r\nshown great presence of mind. Now go with your mother, and get rid of\r\nthe slimy traces of your disaster! You have brought me splendid canes,\r\nexactly what I want for a new scheme of mine."\r\n\r\nThe fact was, I meant to try to construct a loom for my wife, for I knew\r\nshe understood weaving, so I chose two fine strong reeds, and splitting\r\nthem carefully, bound them together again, that when dry they might be\r\nquite straight and equal, and fit for a frame. Smaller reeds were cut\r\ninto pieces and sharpened, for the teeth of the comb. The boys did this\r\nfor me without in the least knowing their use, and great fun they made\r\nof "father\'s monster toothpicks."\r\n\r\nIn time all the various parts of the loom were made ready, and put\r\ntogether, my wife knowing nothing of it, while to the incessant\r\nquestions of the children, I replied mysteriously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is an outlandish sort of musical instrument; mother will know\r\nhow to play upon it."\r\n\r\nAnd when the time came for presenting it, her joy was only equaled by\r\nthe amusement and interest with which the children watched her\r\nmovements while "playing the loom," as they always said.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, a beautiful little foal, a son of the onager, was added\r\nto our stud, and as he promised to grow up strong and tractable, we soon\r\nsaw how useful he would be. The name of Swift was given to him, and he\r\nwas to be trained for my own riding.\r\n\r\nThe interior arrangements of the cavern being now well forward, I\r\napplied myself to contriving an aqueduct, that fresh water might be led\r\nclose up to our cave, for it was a long way to go to fetch it from\r\nJackal River, and especially inconvenient on washing days. As I wanted\r\nto do this before the rainy season began, I set about it at once.\r\n\r\nPipes of hollow bamboo answered the purpose well, and a large cask\r\nformed the reservoir. The supply was good, and the comfort of having it\r\nclose at hand so great, that the mother declared she was as well pleased\r\nwith our engineering as if we had made her a fountain and marble basin\r\nadorned with mermaids and dolphins.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the setting in of the rains, I pressed forward all work\r\nconnected with stores for the winter, and great was the in-gathering of\r\nroots, fruits, and grains, potatoes, rice, guavas, sweet acorns,\r\npine-cones; load after load arrived at the cavern, and the mother\'s\r\nactive needle was in constant requisition, as the demand for more sacks\r\nand bags was incessant.\r\n\r\nCasks and barrels of all sorts and sizes were pressed into the service,\r\nuntil at last the raft was knocked to pieces, and its tubs made to do\r\nduty in the storerooms.\r\n\r\nThe weather became very unsettled and stormy.\r\n\r\nHeavy clouds gathered in the horizon, and passing storms of wind, with\r\nthunder, lightning, and torrents of rain swept over the face of nature\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nThe sea was in frequent commotion; heavy ground swells drove masses of\r\nwater hissing and foaming against the cliffs. Everything heralded the\r\napproaching rains. All nature joined in sounding forth the solemn\r\noverture to the grandest work of the year.\r\n\r\nIt was now near the beginning of the month of June, and we had twelve\r\nweeks of bad weather before us.\r\n\r\nWe established some of the animals with ourselves at the salt cave. The\r\ncow, the ass, Lightfoot, Storm, and the dogs, were all necessary to us,\r\nwhile Knips, Fangs, and the eagle were sure to be a great amusement in\r\nthe long evenings.\r\n\r\nThe boys would ride over to Falconhurst very often to see that all was\r\nin order there, and fetch anything required.\r\n\r\nMuch remained to be done in order to give the cave a comfortable\r\nappearance, which became more desirable now that we had to live indoors.\r\n\r\nThe darkness of the inner regions annoyed me, and I set myself to invent\r\na remedy.\r\n\r\nAfter some thought, I called in Jack\'s assistance, and we got a very\r\ntall, strong bamboo, which would reach right up to the vaulted roof.\r\nThis we planted in the earthen floor, securing well by driving wedges in\r\nround it. Jack ascended this pole very cleverly, taking with him a\r\nhammer and chisel to enlarge a crevice in the roof so as to fix a\r\npulley, by means of which, when he descended, I drew up a large ship\'s\r\nlantern, well supplied with oil, and as there were four wicks, it\r\nafforded a very fair amount of light.\r\n\r\nSeveral days were spent in arranging the different rooms.\r\n\r\nErnest and Franz undertook the library, fixing shelves, and setting\r\nbooks in order.\r\n\r\nJack and his mother took in hand the sitting room and kitchen, while\r\nFritz and I, as better able for heavy work, arranged the workshops. The\r\ncarpenter\'s bench, the turning lathe, and a large chest of tools were\r\nset in convenient places, and many tools and instruments hung on the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nAn adjoining chamber was fitted up as a forge, with fireplace, bellows,\r\nand anvil, complete, all which we had found in the ship, packed,\r\ntogether, and ready to set up.\r\n\r\nWhen these great affairs were settled, we still found in all directions\r\nwork to be done. Shelves, tables, benches, movable steps, cupboards,\r\npegs, door handles, and bolts--there seemed no end to our requirements,\r\nand we often thought of the enormous amount of work necessary to\r\nmaintain the comforts and conveniences of life which at home we had\r\nreceived as matters of course.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, the more there was to do the better; and I never ceased\r\ncontriving fresh improvements, being fully aware of the importance of\r\nconstant employment as a means of strengthening and maintaining the\r\nhealth of mind and body. This, indeed, with a consciousness of continual\r\nprogress toward a desirable end, is found to constitute the main element\r\nof happiness.\r\n\r\nOur rocky home was greatly improved by a wide porch which I made along\r\nthe whole front of our rooms and entrances, by leveling the ground to\r\nform a terrace, and sheltering it with a veranda of bamboo, supported by\r\npillars of the same.\r\n\r\nErnest and Franz were highly successful as librarians.\r\n\r\nThe books, when unpacked and arranged, proved to be a most valuable\r\ncollection, capable of affording every sort of educational advantage.\r\n\r\nBesides a variety of books of voyages, travels, divinity, and natural\r\nhistory (several containing fine colored illustrations), there were\r\nhistories and scientific works, as well as standard fictions in several\r\nlanguages; also a good assortment of maps, charts, mathematical and\r\nastronomical instruments, and an excellent pair of globes.\r\n\r\nI foresaw much interesting study on discovering that we possessed the\r\ngrammars and dictionaries of a great many languages, a subject for which\r\nwe all had a taste. With French we were well acquainted. Fritz and\r\nErnest had begun to learn English at school, and made further progress\r\nduring a visit to England. The mother, who had once been intimate with\r\na Dutch family, could speak that language pretty well.\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of discussion, we agreed to study different\r\nlanguages, so that in the event of meeting with people of other nations,\r\nthere should be at least one of the family able to communicate with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll determined to improve our knowledge of German and French.\r\n\r\nThe two elder boys were to study English and Dutch with their mother.\r\n\r\nErnest, already possessing considerable knowledge of Latin, wished to\r\ncontinue to study it, so as to be able to make use of the many works on\r\nnatural history and medicine written in that language.\r\n\r\nJack announced that he meant to learn Spanish, "because it sounded so\r\ngrand and imposing."\r\n\r\nI myself was interested in the Malay language, knowing it to be so\r\nwidely spoken in the islands of the Eastern Seas, and thinking it as\r\nlikely as any other to be useful to us.\r\n\r\nOur family circle by and by represented Babel in miniature, for scraps\r\nand fragments of all these tongues kept buzzing about our ears from\r\nmorning to night, each sporting his newly acquired word or sentence on\r\nevery possible occasion, propounding idioms and peculiar expressions\r\nlike riddles, to puzzle the rest.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the labor of learning was very considerably lightened, and\r\nevery one came to know a few words of each language.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we amused ourselves by opening chests and packages hitherto\r\nuntouched, and brought unexpected treasures to light--mirrors,\r\nwardrobes, a pair of console tables with polished marble tops, elegant\r\nwriting tables and handsome chairs, clocks of various descriptions, a\r\nmusical box, and a chronometer were found; and by degrees our abode was\r\nfitted up like a palace, so that sometimes we wondered at ourselves, and\r\nfelt as though we were strutting about in borrowed plumes.\r\n\r\nThe children begged me to decide on a name for our salt-cave dwelling,\r\nand that of Rockburg was chosen unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe weeks of imprisonment passed so rapidly, that no one found time hang\r\nheavy on his hands.\r\n\r\nBooks occupied me so much that but little carpentering was done, yet I\r\nmade a yoke for the oxen, a pair of cotton wool carders, and a spinning\r\nwheel for my wife.\r\n\r\nAs the rainy season drew to a close, the weather for a while became\r\nwilder, and the storms fiercer than ever. Thunder roared, lightning\r\nblazed, torrents rushed toward the sea, which came in raging billows to\r\nmeet them, lashed to fury by the tempests of wind which swept the\r\nsurface of the deep.\r\n\r\nThe uproar of the elements came to an end at last.\r\n\r\nNature resumed her attitude of repose, her smiling aspect of peaceful\r\nbeauty; and soon all traces of the ravages of floods and storms would\r\ndisappear beneath the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics.\r\n\r\nGladly quitting the sheltering walls of Rockburg to roam once more in\r\nthe open air, we crossed Jackal River, for a walk along the coast, and\r\npresently Fritz with sharp eyes observed something on the small island\r\nnear Flamingo Marsh, which was, he said, long and rounded, resembling a\r\nboat bottom upward.\r\n\r\nExamining it with the telescope, I could form no other conjecture, and\r\nwe resolved to make it the object of an excursion next day, being\r\ndelighted to resume our old habit of starting in pursuit of adventure.\r\n\r\nThe boat was accordingly got in readiness; it required some repairs, and\r\nfresh pitching, and then we made for the point of interest, indulging in\r\na variety of surmises as to what we should find.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a huge, stranded whale.\r\n\r\nThe island being steep and rocky, it was necessary to be careful; but we\r\nfound a landing-place on the further side. The boys hurried by the\r\nnearest way to the beach where lay the monster of the deep, while I\r\nclambered to the highest point of the islet, which commanded a view of\r\nthe mainland, from Rockburg to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nOn rejoining my sons, I found them only half-way to the great fish, and\r\nas I drew near they shouted in high glee:\r\n\r\n"Oh! father, just look at the glorious shells and coral branches we are\r\nfinding. How does it happen that there are such quantities?"\r\n\r\n"Only consider how the recent storms have stirred the ocean to its\r\ndepths! No doubt thousands of shell-fish have been detached from their\r\nrocks and dashed in all directions by the waves, which have thrown\r\nashore even so huge a creature as the whale yonder."\r\n\r\n"Yes; isn\'t he a frightful great brute!" cried Fritz. "Ever so much\r\nlarger than he seemed from a distance. The worst of it is, one does not\r\nwell see what use to make of the huge carcase."\r\n\r\n"Why, make train oil, to be sure," said Ernest. "I can\'t say he\'s a\r\nbeauty, though, and it is much pleasanter to gather these lovely shells,\r\nthan to cut up blubber."\r\n\r\n"Well, let us amuse ourselves with them for the present," said I, "but\r\nin the afternoon, when the sea is calmer, we will return with the\r\nnecessary implements, and see if we can turn the stranded whale to good\r\naccount."\r\n\r\nWe were soon ready to return to the boat, but Ernest had a fancy for\r\nremaining alone on the island till we came back, and asked my permission\r\nto do so, that he might experience, for an hour or two, the sensations\r\nof Robinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nTo this, however, I would not consent, assuring him that our fate, as a\r\nsolitary family, gave him quite sufficient idea of shipwreck on an\r\nuninhabited island, and that his lively imagination must supply the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe boys found it hard work to row back, and began to beg of me to exert\r\nmy wonderful inventive powers in contriving some kind of rowing machine.\r\n\r\n"You lazy fellows!" returned I; "give me the great clockwork out of a\r\nchurch tower, perhaps I might be able to relieve your labors."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father!" cried Fritz, "don\'t you know there are iron wheels in the\r\nclockwork of the large kitchen-jacks? I\'m sure mother would give them\r\nup, and you could make something out of them, could you not?"\r\n\r\n"By the time I have manufactured a rowing-machine out of a\r\nroasting-jack, I think your arms will be pretty well inured to the use\r\nof your oars! However, I am far from despising the hint, my dear Fritz."\r\n\r\n"Is coral of any use?" demanded Jack suddenly.\r\n\r\n"In former times it was pounded and used by chemists; but it is now\r\nchiefly used for various ornaments, and made into beads for necklaces,\r\netc. As such, it is greatly prized by savages, and were we to fall in\r\nwith natives, we might very possibly find a store of coral useful in\r\nbartering with them.\r\n\r\n"For the present, we will arrange these treasures of the deep in our\r\nlibrary, and make them the beginning of a Museum of Natural History,\r\nwhich will afford us equal pleasure and instruction."\r\n\r\n"One might almost say that coral belongs at once to the animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral kingdoms," remarked Fritz; "it is hard like\r\nstone, it has stems and branches like a shrub, and I believe tiny\r\ninsects inhabit the cells, do they not, father?"\r\n\r\n"You are right, Fritz; coral consists of the calcareous cells of minute\r\nanimals, so built up as to form a tree-like structure.\r\n\r\n"The coral fishery gives employment to many men in the Persian Gulf, the\r\nMediterranean Sea, and other places. The instrument commonly used\r\nconsists of two heavy beams of wood, secured together at right angles,\r\nand loaded with stones. Hemp and netting are attached to the under side\r\nof the beams, to the middle of which is fastened one end of a strong\r\nrope, by which the apparatus is let down from a boat, and guided to the\r\nspots where the coral is most abundant.\r\n\r\n"The branches of the coral become entangled in the hemp and network;\r\nthey are broken off from the rock, and are drawn to the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"Left undisturbed, these coral insects, laboring incessantly, raise\r\nfoundations, on which, in course of time, fertile islands appear,\r\nclothed with verdure, and inhabited by man."\r\n\r\n"Why, father, here we are at the landing place!" exclaimed Jack. "It has\r\nseemed quite easy to pull since you began to tell us such interesting\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Very interesting, indeed; but did you notice that the wind had changed,\r\nJack?" remarked Ernest as he shipped his oar.\r\n\r\nThe animated recital of our adventures, the sight of the lovely shells\r\nand corals, and the proposed work for the afternoon, inspired the mother\r\nand Franz with a great wish to accompany us.\r\n\r\nTo this I gladly consented, only stipulating that we should go provided\r\nwith food, water, and a compass. "For," said I, "the sea has only just\r\nceased from its raging, and being at the best of times of uncertain and\r\ncapricious nature, we may chance to be detained on the island, or forced\r\nto land at a considerable distance from home."\r\n\r\nDinner was quickly dispatched, and preparations set on foot.\r\n\r\nThe more oil we could obtain the better, for a great deal was used in\r\nthe large lantern which burnt day and night in the recesses of the cave;\r\ntherefore all available casks and barrels were pressed into the service;\r\nmany, of course, once full of pickled herrings, potted pigeons, and\r\nother winter stores, were now empty, and we took a goodly fleet of these\r\nin tow.\r\n\r\nKnives, hatchets, and the boys\' climbing buskins, were put on board, and\r\nwe set forth, the labor of the oar being greater than ever, now that our\r\nfreight was so much increased.\r\n\r\nThe sea being calm, and the tide suiting better, we found it easy to\r\nland close to the whale; my first care was to place the boat, as well as\r\nthe casks, in perfect security, after which we proceeded to a close\r\ninspection of our prize.\r\n\r\nIts enormous size quite startled my wife and her little boy; the length\r\nbeing from sixty to sixty-five feet, and the girth between thirty and\r\nforty, while the weight could not have been less than 50,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe color was a uniform velvety black, and the enormous head about\r\none-third of the length of the entire bulk, the eyes quite small, not\r\nmuch larger than those of an ox, and the ears almost undiscernible.\r\n\r\nThe jaw opened very far back, and was nearly sixteen feet in length, the\r\nmost curious part of its structure being the remarkable substance known\r\nas whalebone, masses of which appeared all along the jaws, solid at the\r\nbase, and splitting into a sort of fringe at the extremity. This\r\narrangement is for the purpose of aiding the whale in procuring its\r\nfood, and separating it from the water.\r\n\r\nThe tongue was remarkably large, soft, and full of oil; the opening of\r\nthe throat wonderfully small, scarcely two inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n"Why, what can the monster eat?" exclaimed Fritz; "he never can swallow\r\na proper mouthful down this little gullet!"\r\n\r\n"The mode of feeding adopted by the whale is so curious," I replied,\r\n"that I must explain it to you before we begin work.\r\n\r\n"This animal (for I should tell you that a whale is not a fish; he\r\npossesses no gills, he breathes atmospheric air, and would be drowned if\r\ntoo long detained below the surface of the water); this animal, then,\r\nfrequents those parts of the ocean best supplied with the various\r\ncreatures on which he feeds. Shrimps, small fish, lobsters, various\r\nmolluscs, and medus\xe6 form his diet. Driving with open mouth through the\r\ncongregated shoals of these little creatures, the whale engulfs them by\r\nmillions in his enormous jaws, and continues his destructive course\r\nuntil he has sufficiently charged his mouth with prey.\r\n\r\n"Closing his jaws and forcing out, through the interstices of the\r\nwhalebone, the water which he has taken together with his prey, he\r\nretains the captured animals, and swallows them at his leisure.\r\n\r\n"The nostrils, or blow-holes, are placed, you see, on the upper part of\r\nthe head, in order that the whale may rise to breathe, and repose on the\r\nsurface of the sea, showing very little of his huge carcase.\r\n\r\n"The breathings are called \'spoutings,\' because a column of mixed vapor\r\nand water is thrown from the blow-holes, sometimes to a height of twenty\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n"And now, boys, fasten on your buskins, and let me see if you can face\r\nthe work of climbing this slippery mountain of flesh, and cutting it\r\nup."\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack stripped, and went to work directly, scrambling over the\r\nback to the head, where they assisted me to cut away the lips, so as to\r\nreach the whalebone, a large quantity of which was detached and carried\r\nto the boat.\r\n\r\nErnest labored manfully at the creature\'s side, cutting out slabs of\r\nblubber, while his mother and Franz helped as well as they could to put\r\nit in casks.\r\n\r\nPresently we had a multitude of unbidden guests.\r\n\r\nThe air was filled by the shrill screams and hoarse croaks and cries of\r\nnumbers of birds of prey, they flew around us in ever narrowing circles,\r\nand becoming bolder as their voracity was excited by the near view of\r\nthe tempting prey, they alighted close to us, snatching morsels greedily\r\nfrom under the very strokes of our knives and hatchets.\r\n\r\nOur work was seriously interrupted by these feathered marauders, who,\r\nafter all, were no greater robbers than we ourselves. We kept them off\r\nas well as we could by blows from our tools, and several were killed, my\r\nwife taking possession of them immediately for the sake of the\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly time to leave the island, but first I stripped off a long\r\npiece of the skin, to be used for traces, harness, and other\r\nleather-work. It was about three-quarters of an inch thick, and very\r\nsoft and oily--but I knew it would shrink and be tough and durable.\r\n\r\nI also took a part of the gums in which the roots of the baleen or\r\nwhalebone was still embedded, having read that this is considered quite\r\na delicacy, as well as the skin, which, when properly dressed and cut in\r\nlittle cubes, like black dice, has been compared, by enthusiastic and\r\nprobably very hungry travelers, to cocoanut and cream-cheese.\r\n\r\nThe boys thought the tongue might prove equally palatable, but I valued\r\nit only on account of the large quantity of oil it contained.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy freight we put to sea, and made what haste we could to\r\nreach home, and cleanse our persons from the unpleasant traces of the\r\ndisgusting work in which we had spent the day.\r\n\r\nNext morning we started at dawn.\r\n\r\nMy wife and Franz were left behind, for our proposed work was even more\r\nhorrible than that of the preceding day; they could not assist, and had\r\nno inclination to witness it.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to open the carcase completely, and, penetrating the\r\ninterior, to obtain various portions of the intestines, thinking that it\r\nwould be possible to convert the larger ones into vessels fit for\r\nholding the oil. This time we laid aside our clothes and wore only\r\nstrong canvas trousers when we commenced operations, which were\r\nvigorously carried on during the whole of the day; then, satisfied that\r\nwe could do so with a clear conscience, we abandoned the remains to the\r\nbirds of prey, and, with a full cargo, set sail for land.\r\n\r\nOn the way, it appeared to strike the boys (who had made not the\r\nslightest objection to the singularly unpleasant task I had set them),\r\nas very strange that I should wish to possess what they had been\r\nworking so hard to procure for me.\r\n\r\n"What can have made you wish to bring away that brute\'s entrails,\r\nfather? Are they of any use?"\r\n\r\n"There are countries," I replied, "where no wood grows of which to make\r\nbarrels, and no hemp for thread, string, and cordage. Necessity, the\r\nmother of all the more valuable inventions, has taught the inhabitants\r\nof these countries, Greenlanders, Esquimaux, and others, to think of\r\nsubstitutes, and they use the intestines of the whale for one purpose,\r\nthe sinews and nerves for the other."\r\n\r\nWe were right glad to land, and get rid, for the present, of our\r\nunpleasant materials, the further preparation of which was work in store\r\nfor the following day.\r\n\r\nA refreshing bath, clean clothes, and supper, cheered us all up, and we\r\nslept in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n The blubber of the whale boiled and stored--A unique\r\n     machine--Expedition to Prospect Hill--Whale\'s tongue is voted no\r\n     delicacy--We land on Whale Island--Jack discovers a strange\r\n     skeleton--Turtle turning--Towed ashore--The loom completed--Return\r\n     of the herring shoals--Basket making--We manufacture a sedan\r\n     chair--Ernest\'s wild ride therein--A boa constrictor appears--He\r\n     retreats to the marsh--Suspense--Poor Grizzle\'s fate--An awful\r\n     scene--Death of the monster--An account of snakes--Remedies for\r\n     poisoned bites--Ernest writes Grizzle\'s epitaph--The serpent\r\n     stuffed and placed in the museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Now for the finishing up of this dirty job," cried I, merrily, as we\r\nall woke up next morning at daybreak. And after the regular work was\r\ndone, we commenced operations by raising a stand or rough scaffold on\r\nwhich the tubs full of blubber were placed and heavily pressed, so that\r\nthe purest and finest oil overflowed into vessels underneath.\r\n\r\nThe blubber was afterward boiled in a cauldron over a fire kindled at\r\nsome distance from our abode, and by skimming and straining through a\r\ncoarse cloth, we succeeded in obtaining a large supply of excellent\r\ntrain-oil, which in casks, and bags made of the intestines, was safely\r\nstowed away in the "cellar," as the children called our roughest\r\nstoreroom. This day\'s work was far from agreeable, and the dreadful\r\nsmell oppressed us all, more especially my poor wife, who, nevertheless,\r\nendured it with her accustomed good temper. Although she very urgently\r\nrecommended that the new island should be the headquarters for another\r\ncolony, where, said she, "any animals we leave would be safe from apes\r\nand other plunderers, and where you would find it so very convenient to\r\nboil whale-blubber, strain train-oil, and the like."\r\n\r\nThis proposal met with hearty approval, especially from the boys, who\r\nwere always charmed with any new plan; and they were eager to act upon\r\nit at once, but when I reminded them of the putrifying carcass which lay\r\nthere, they confessed it would be better to allow wind and storms, birds\r\nand insects to do their work in purging the atmosphere, and reducing the\r\nwhale to a skeleton before we revisited the island.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a rowing-machine kept recurring to my brain. I determined to\r\nattempt to make one.\r\n\r\nI took an iron bar, which when laid across the middle of the boat\r\nprojected about a foot each way. I provided this bar in the middle with\r\nribbed machinery, and at each end with a sort of nave, in which, as in a\r\ncart wheel, four flat spokes, or paddles, were fixed obliquely. These\r\nwere intended to do the rowers\' part.\r\n\r\nThen the jack was arranged to act upon the machinery in the middle of\r\nthe iron cross-bar, in such a way that one of its strong cogwheels bit\r\nfirmly into the ribs, so that, when it was wound up, it caused the bar\r\nto revolve rapidly, of course turning with the paddles fixed at either\r\nend, which consequently struck the water so as to propel the boat.\r\n\r\nAlthough this contrivance left much to be desired in the way of\r\nimprovement, still when Fritz and I wound up the machinery, and went off\r\non a trial trip across the bay, we splashed along at such a famous rate,\r\nthat the shores rang with the cheers and clapping of the whole family,\r\ndelighted to behold what they considered my brilliant success.\r\n\r\nEvery one wanted to go on board, and take a cruise, but as it was\r\ngetting late, I could not consent. A trip next day, however, was\r\npromised to Cape Disappointment and the little settlement of Prospect\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nThis proposal satisfied everybody. The evening was spent in preparing\r\nthe dresses, arms, and food which would be required, and we retired\r\nearly to rest.\r\n\r\nIntending to be out all day, the house was left in good order, and we\r\ndeparted on our expedition, provided, among other things, with spades\r\nand mattocks, for I wished to get young cocoanut trees and shrubs of\r\ndifferent kinds, that, on our way back, we might land on Whale Island,\r\nand begin our plantation there.\r\n\r\nWe directed our course toward the opposite side of the bay. The sea was\r\nsmooth, my rowing machine performed its work easily, and, leaving Safety\r\nBay and Shark Island behind us, we enjoyed at our ease the panorama of\r\nall the coast scenery.\r\n\r\nLanding near Prospect Hill, we moored the boat, and walked through the\r\nwoods to our little farm, obtaining some fresh cocoanuts, as well as\r\nyoung plants, on the way.\r\n\r\nBefore coming in sight of the cottage at the farm, we heard the cocks\r\ncrow, and I experienced a sudden rush of emotion as the sound recalled,\r\nin a degree painfully vivid, the recollection of many a ride and walk at\r\nhome, when we would be greeted by just such familiar sounds as we\r\napproached some kind friend\'s house. Here, but for the unconscious\r\nanimals, utter solitude and silence prevailed, and I with my dear\r\nfamily, whose visit would have been hailed with delight in so many\r\nhomes, advanced unnoticed to this lonely cottage. So long had been our\r\nabsence that our arrival created a perfect panic. The original animals\r\nhad forgotten us, and to their progeny, lambs, kids, and chickens, who\r\nhad never seen the face of man, we seemed an army of fierce foes.\r\n\r\nThe boys found it impossible to milk the goats, until, by the use of the\r\nlasso, they captured them one after the other, bound their legs, then\r\ngiving them salt to lick, they soon obtained a supply of excellent milk,\r\nwhich was poured from the cocoanut shells they used into calabash\r\nflasks, so that we could take with us what was not required at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe fowls were enticed by handfuls of grain and rice, and my wife caught\r\nas many as she wished for.\r\n\r\nWe were by this time very ready for dinner, and the cold provisions we\r\nhad with us were set forth, the chief dish consisting of the piece of\r\nwhale\'s tongue, which, by the boys\' desire, had been cooked with a\r\nspecial view to this entertainment.\r\n\r\nBut woeful was the disappointment when the tongue was tasted! One after\r\nanother, with dismal face, pronounced it "horrid stuff," begged for some\r\npickled herring to take away the taste of train-oil, and willingly\r\nbestowed on Fangs the cherished dainty.\r\n\r\nFortunately there was a sufficient supply of other eatables, and the\r\nfresh, delicious cocoanuts and goat\'s milk put every one in good humor\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhile the mother packed everything up, Fritz and I got some sugar-cane\r\nshoots which I wished to plant, and then we returned to the shore and\r\nagain embarked.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to Whale Island, I felt a strong wish to round Cape\r\nDisappointment and survey the coast immediately beyond, but the\r\npromontory maintained the character of its name, and we found that a\r\nlong sandbank, as well as hidden reefs and rocks, ran out a great way\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nFritz espying breakers ahead, we put about at once, and aided by a light\r\nbreeze, directed our course toward Whale Island.\r\n\r\nOn landing, I began at once to plant the saplings we had brought. The\r\nboys assisted me for a while, but wearied somewhat of the occupation,\r\nand one after another went off in search of shells and coral, leaving\r\ntheir mother and me to finish the work.\r\n\r\nPresently Jack came back, shouting loudly:\r\n\r\n"Father! Mother! do come and look. There is an enormous skeleton lying\r\nhere; the skeleton of some fearful great beast--a mammoth, I should\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"Why, Jack!" returned I, laughing, "have you forgot our old\r\nacquaintance, the whale? What else could it be?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, father, it is not the whale. This thing has not fish bones, but\r\nreal, good, honest, huge beast bones. I don\'t know what can have become\r\nof the whale--floated out to sea, most likely. This mammoth is ever so\r\nmuch bigger. Come and see!"\r\n\r\nAs I was about to follow the boy, a voice from another direction\r\nsuddenly cried:\r\n\r\n"Father! father! a great enormous turtle! Please make haste. It is\r\nwaddling back to the sea as hard as it can go, and we can\'t stop it."\r\n\r\nThis appeal being more pressing, as well as more important than Jack\'s,\r\nI snatched up an oar and hastened to their assistance.\r\n\r\nSure enough a large turtle was scrambling quickly toward the water, and\r\nwas within a few paces of it, although Ernest was valiantly holding on\r\nby one of its hind legs.\r\n\r\nI sprang down the bank, and making use of the oar as a lever, we\r\nsucceeded with some difficulty in turning the creature on its back.\r\n\r\nIt was a huge specimen, fully eight feet long, and being now quite\r\nhelpless, we left it sprawling, and went to inspect Jack\'s mammoth\r\nskeleton, which, of course, proved to be neither more nor less than that\r\nof the whale. I convinced him of the fact by pointing out the marks of\r\nour feet on the ground, and the broken jaws where we had hacked out the\r\nwhalebone.\r\n\r\n"What can have made you take up that fancy about a mammoth, my boy?"\r\n\r\n"Ernest put it into my head, father. He said there seemed to be the\r\nskeleton of an antediluvian monster there, so I ran to look closer, and\r\nI never thought of the whale, when I saw no fish bones. I suppose Ernest\r\nwas joking."\r\n\r\n"Whales are generally considered as fishes by those little acquainted\r\nwith the animal kingdom, but they belong to the class of mammals, which\r\ncomprises man, the monkey tribes, the bats, the dogs and cats, all\r\nhoofed animals, whales and their allies, with other animals, the last on\r\nthe list being the sloth.\r\n\r\n"The name by which they are distinguished is derived from the Latin word\r\n\'mamma,\' a breast, and is given to them because all the species\r\nbelonging to this class are furnished with a set of organs called the\r\nmammary glands, secreting the liquid known as milk, by which the young\r\nare nourished.\r\n\r\n"The bones of the whale differ from those of animals, simply in being of\r\na hollow construction, and filled with air so as to render the carcass\r\nmore buoyant. The bones of birds are also hollow, for the same reason,\r\nand in all this we see conspicuously the wisdom and goodness of the\r\ngreat Creator."\r\n\r\n"What a marvelous structure it is, father!" said Fritz. "What a\r\nponderous mass of bones! Can we not make use of any of them?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing strikes me at this moment; we will leave them to bleach here\r\nyet awhile, and perhaps, by sawing them up afterward, make a few chairs,\r\nor a reading desk for the museum. But now it is time to return home.\r\nBring the boat round to where the turtle awaits his fate; we must settle\r\nhow to deal with him."\r\n\r\nIt was soon decided that he must swim. I fastened the empty water-cask\r\nto a long line, one end of which was made fast to the bow of the boat,\r\nthe other carefully passed round the neck and fore paws of the creature,\r\nwho was then lifted, so as to let him regain his feet, when he instantly\r\nmade for the water, plunged in, the cask floated after him, and\r\nprevented his sinking. We were all on board in a moment; and the worthy\r\nfellow, after vainly attempting to dive, set himself diligently to swim\r\nright forward, towing us comfortably after him. I was ready to cut the\r\nline on the least appearance of danger, and kept him on the course for\r\nSafety Bay by striking the water with a boat-hook, right or left,\r\naccording as the turtle was disposed to turn too much one way or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted with the fun, and compared me to Neptune in his\r\ncar, drawn by dolphins, and accompanied by Amphitrite and attendant\r\nTritons.\r\n\r\nWe landed safely at the usual place, near Rockburg, and the turtle was\r\ncondemned and executed soon afterward; the shell, which was quite eight\r\nfeet long, and three broad, was, when cleaned and prepared, to form a\r\ntrough for the water supply at the cave, and the meat was carefully\r\nsalted, and stored up for many a good and savory meal.\r\n\r\nIt had been my intention to bring a piece of land under cultivation\r\nbefore the next rainy season, to be sown with different sorts of grain;\r\nbut many unforeseen circumstances had intervened to hinder this, and our\r\nanimals, unaccustomed to the yoke, were not available for the plow.\r\n\r\nI therefore gave up the idea for the present, and applied myself, with\r\nErnest\'s assistance, to completing the loom, which, although the\r\nworkmanship was clumsy, I succeeded in making quite fit for use. I had\r\nfortunately in my younger days spent many hours in the workshops of\r\nweavers and other artisans, and therefore I understood more than might\r\nhave been expected of their various crafts.\r\n\r\nPaste or size was required to smear over the threads; but we could not\r\nspare floor for such a purpose, and I used isinglass, which kept the\r\nwarp moist perfectly well, and spared us the necessity of setting up the\r\nloom in a damp uncomfortable place, which has often to be done to\r\nprevent the over-drying of the web.\r\n\r\nOf this isinglass I also made thin plates, to be used as window-panes;\r\nthey were at least as transparent as horn, and when fixed deep in the\r\nrock, and beyond the reach of rain, did good service in admitting light.\r\n\r\nSuccess encouraging me to persevere, I next began harness-making; the\r\nspoils of the chase having furnished us with plenty of leather, with\r\nwhich I covered light frames of wood, using a hairy moss or lichen for\r\nstuffing, and ere long the animals were equipped with saddles,\r\nstirrups, bridles, yokes, and collars, to the very great satisfaction of\r\ntheir youthful riders and drivers.\r\n\r\nThis occupation was followed by a great deal of work connected with the\r\nannual return of the herring shoals, which now took place; to them\r\nsucceeding, as on former occasions, shoals of other fish, and many\r\nseals. More than ever aware of the value of all these, we did not fail\r\nto make good use of our opportunities, and captured large numbers.\r\n\r\nThe boys were getting anxious for another shooting expedition; but\r\nbefore undertaking that, I wished to do some basket-making, as sacks\r\nwere beginning to fail us, and there was constant demand for baskets in\r\nwhich to carry and keep our roots and fruits. Our first attempts were\r\nclumsy enough; but, as usual, perseverance was rewarded, and we produced\r\na good supply of all sorts and sizes. One very large basket I furnished\r\nwith openings through which to pass a strong stick, so that it might,\r\nwhen heavily laden, be carried by two persons.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the children see the force of this idea, than they got a\r\nbamboo, and popping little Franz into the basket, carried him about in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThis amusement suggested a fresh notion to Fritz. "Oh, father," cried\r\nhe, "don\'t you think we might make something like this for mother, and\r\ncarry her much more comfortably than jolting along in the cart?"\r\n\r\nThe boys shouted with glee at the proposal, and though their mother\r\nthought the plan feasible enough, she confessed that she did not much\r\nlike the thoughts of sitting in the middle of a basket, and just looking\r\nout now and then over the rim.\r\n\r\nHowever, I assured her it should be a well-shaped, comfortable\r\nsedan-chair, or litter; and the next question was how it should be\r\ncarried, since the boys could not play the part of Indian\r\npalanquin-bearers, either with safety to their mother, or with any\r\npleasure to themselves.\r\n\r\n"The bull and the buffalo!" cried Jack. "Why not use them for it? Let\'s\r\ngo and try them now!"\r\n\r\nOff ran the boys, and in a short time the basket was securely hung\r\nbetween Storm and Grumble. Fritz and Jack sprang into their saddles, and\r\nErnest very gingerly deposited himself in the "cradle," as Franz called\r\nit; they set forth at a most sober pace, the animals, who were perfectly\r\ndocile, appearing only a little surprised at the new arrangement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is so pleasant, mother, it is a delightful motion," cried\r\nErnest, as they passed us; "it swings and rocks really soothingly.\r\nQuicker, Fritz! go quicker!" and the trot pleasing him equally well, the\r\npace gradually quickened, till the animals were going along at a rate\r\nwhich shook and jolted the basket about most fearfully. Ernest called\r\nand screamed in vain for a halt. His brothers thought it capital fun to\r\n"shake up" the "professor," and made the circuit of the level ground\r\nnear Rockburg, finally pulling up in front of us, like performers\r\nstopping to receive the applause of spectators.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to help laughing, the scene was so ridiculous, but\r\nErnest was very angry with his brothers, his reproaches provoked high\r\nwords in reply, and a quarrel was imminent, but I interfered, and showed\r\nthem how easily a joke, carried too far, would lead to disputes and bad\r\nfeeling, urging them to avoid on all occasions any breach of the\r\ngood-fellowship and brotherly love which was the mainstay of our\r\nstrength and happiness.\r\n\r\nGood humor was soon restored, Ernest himself helped to unharness the\r\nbeasts, and got some handfuls of salt and barley to reward their\r\nexertions, saying that they must have some more palanquin-practice\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\nI was seated with my wife and Fritz beneath the shade of the veranda,\r\nengaged in wicker-work, and chatting pleasantly, when suddenly Fritz got\r\nup, advanced a step or two, gazing fixedly along the avenue which led\r\nfrom Jackal River, then he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"I see something so strange in the distance, father! What in the world\r\ncan it be? first it seems to be drawn in coils on the ground like a\r\ncable, then uprises as if it were a little mast, then that sinks, and\r\nthe coils move along again. It is coming toward the bridge."\r\n\r\nMy wife took alarm at this description, and calling the other boys,\r\nretreated into the cave, where I desired them to close up the entrances,\r\nand keep watch with firearms at the upper windows. These were openings\r\nwe had made in the rock at some elevation, reached within by steps, and\r\na kind of gallery which passed along the front of the rooms.\r\n\r\nFritz remained by me while I examined the object through my spyglass.\r\n\r\n"It is, as I feared, an enormous serpent!" cried I; "it advances\r\ndirectly this way, and we shall be placed in the greatest possible\r\ndanger, for it will cross the bridge to a certainty."\r\n\r\n"May we not attack it, father?" exclaimed the brave boy.\r\n\r\n"Only with the greatest caution," returned I; "it is far too formidable,\r\nand too tenacious of life, for us rashly to attempt its destruction.\r\nThank God, we are at Rockburg, where we can keep in safe retreat, while\r\nwe watch for an opportunity to destroy this frightful enemy. Go up to\r\nyour mother now, and assist in preparing the firearms; I will join you\r\ndirectly, but I must further observe the monster\'s movements."\r\n\r\nFritz left me unwilling, while I continued to watch the serpent, which\r\nwas of gigantic size, and already much too near the bridge to admit of\r\nthe possibility of removing that means of access to our dwelling. I\r\nrecollected, too, how easily it would pass through the walls. The\r\nreptile advanced with writhing and undulatory movements, from time to\r\ntime rearing its head to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and\r\nslowly turning it about, as though on the lookout for prey.\r\n\r\nAs it crossed the bridge, with a slow, suspicious motion, I withdrew,\r\nand hastily rejoined my little party, which was preparing to garrison\r\nour fortress in warlike array, but with considerable trepidation, which\r\nmy presence served in a measure to allay.\r\n\r\nWe placed ourselves at the upper openings, after strongly barricading\r\neverything below, and, ourselves unseen, awaited with beating hearts the\r\nfurther advance of the foe, which speedily became visible to us.\r\n\r\nIts movements appeared to become uncertain, as though puzzled by the\r\ntrace of human habitation; it turned in different directions, coiling\r\nand uncoiling, and frequently rearing its head, but keeping about the\r\nmiddle of the space in front of the cave, when suddenly, as though\r\nunable to resist doing so, one after another the boys fired, and even\r\ntheir mother discharged her gun. The shots took not the slightest effect\r\nbeyond startling the monster, whose movements were accelerated. Fritz\r\nand I also fired with steadier aim, but with the same want of success,\r\nfor the monster, passing on with a gliding motion, entered the reedy\r\nmarsh to the left, and entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nA wonderful weight seemed lifted from our hearts, while all eagerly\r\ndiscussed the vast length and awful though magnificent appearance of the\r\nserpent. I had recognized it as the boa constrictor. It was a vast\r\nspecimen, upward of thirty feet in length.\r\n\r\nI explained to the children that its name in South America is Boaguacu;\r\nthe first syllable of that word, with the Latin addition, which\r\nindicates that it kills its prey by pressure, or "constriction," gives\r\nthe name by which it is commonly known.\r\n\r\nThe near neighborhood of this terrific reptile occasioned me the utmost\r\nanxiety; and I desired that no one should leave the house on any\r\npretense whatever, without my express permission.\r\n\r\nDuring three whole days we were kept in suspense and fear, not daring to\r\nstir above a few hundred steps from the door, although during all that\r\ntime the enemy showed no sign of his presence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we might have been induced to think the boa had passed across\r\nthe swamp, and found his way by some cleft or chasm through the wall of\r\ncliffs beyond, had not the restless behavior of our geese and ducks\r\ngiven proof that he still lurked in the thicket of reeds which they were\r\naccustomed to make their nightly resting place.\r\n\r\nThey swam anxiously about, and with much clapping of wings and disturbed\r\ncackling showed their uneasiness; finally taking wing they crossed the\r\nharbor, and took up their quarters on Shark Island.\r\n\r\nMy embarrassment increased, as time passed on. I could not venture to\r\nattack with insufficient force a monstrous and formidable serpent\r\nconcealed in dense thickets amidst dangerous swamps; yet it was dreadful\r\nto live in a state of blockade, cut off from all the important duties in\r\nwhich we were engaged, and shut up with our animals in the unnatural\r\nlight of the cave, enduring constant anxiety and perturbation.\r\n\r\nOut of this painful state we were at last delivered by none other than\r\nour good old simple-hearted donkey; not, however, by the exercise of a\r\npraiseworthy quality, such as the vigilance of the time-honored geese of\r\nthe Capitol, but by sheer stupidity.\r\n\r\nOur situation was rendered the more critical from having no great stock\r\nof provisions, or fodder for the animals; and the hay failing us on the\r\nevening of the third day, I determined to set them at liberty by sending\r\nthem, under guidance of Fritz, across the river at the ford.\r\n\r\nHe was to ride Lightfoot, and they were to be fastened together until\r\nsafely over.\r\n\r\nNext morning we began to prepare for this by tying them in a line, and\r\nwhile so engaged my wife opened the door, when old Grizzle, who was\r\nfresh and frolicsome after the long rest and regular feeding, suddenly\r\nbroke away from the halter, cut some awkward capers, then bolting out,\r\ncareened at full gallop straight for the marsh.\r\n\r\nIn vain we called him by name. Fritz would even have rushed after him,\r\nhad not I held him back. In another moment the ass was close to the\r\nthicket, and with the cold shudder of horror, we beheld the snake rear\r\nitself from its lair, the fiery eyes glanced around, the dark, deadly\r\njaws opened widely, the forked tongue darted greedily forth--poor\r\nGrizzle\'s fate was sealed.\r\n\r\nBecoming aware on a sudden of his danger, he stopped short, spread out\r\nall four legs, and set up the most piteous and discordant bray that ever\r\nwrung echo from the rocks.\r\n\r\nSwift and straight as a fencer\'s thrust, the destroyer was upon him,\r\nwound round him, entangled, enfolded, compressed him, all the while\r\ncunningly avoiding the convulsive kicks of the agonized animal.\r\n\r\nA cry of horror arose from the spectators of this miserable tragedy.\r\n\r\n"Shoot him, father! oh, shoot him--do save poor Grizzle!"\r\n\r\n"My children, it is impossible!" cried I. "Our old friend is lost to us\r\nfor ever! I have hopes, however, that when gorged with his prey we may\r\nbe able to attack the snake with some chance of success."\r\n\r\n"But the horrible wretch is never going to swallow him all at once,\r\nfather?" cried Jack. "That will be too shocking!"\r\n\r\n"Snakes have no grinders, but only fangs, therefore they cannot chew\r\ntheir food, and must swallow it whole. But although the idea is\r\nstartling, it is not really more shocking than the rending, tearing, and\r\nshedding of blood which occurs when the lions and tigers seize their\r\nprey."\r\n\r\n"But," said Franz, "how can the snake separate the flesh from the bones\r\nwithout teeth? And is this kind of snake poisonous?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear child," said I, "only fearfully strong and ferocious. And it\r\nhas no need to tear the flesh from the bones. It swallows them, skin,\r\nhair, and all, and digests everything in its stomach."\r\n\r\n"It seems utterly impossible that the broad ribs, the strong legs,\r\nhoofs, and all, should go down that throat," exclaimed Fritz.\r\n\r\n"Only see," I replied, "how the monster deals with his victim; closer\r\nand more tightly he curls his crushing folds, the bones give way, he is\r\nkneading him into a shapeless mass. He will soon begin to gorge his\r\nprey, and slowly but surely it will disappear down that distended maw!"\r\n\r\nThe mother, with little Franz, found the scene all too horrible, and\r\nhastened into the cave, trembling and distressed.\r\n\r\nTo the rest of us there seemed a fearful fascination in the dreadful\r\nsight, and we could not move from the spot. I expected that the boa,\r\nbefore swallowing his prey, would cover it with saliva, to aid in the\r\noperation, although it struck me that its very slender forked tongue was\r\nabout the worst possible implement for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to us, however, that this popular idea was erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe act of lubricating the mass must have taken place during the process\r\nof swallowing; certainly nothing was applied beforehand.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful performance lasted from seven in the morning until noon.\r\nWhen the awkward morsel was entirely swallowed, the serpent lay stiff,\r\ndistorted, and apparently insensible along the edge of the marsh.\r\n\r\nI felt that now or never was the moment for attack!\r\n\r\nCalling on my sons to maintain their courage and presence of mind, I\r\nleft our retreat with a feeling of joyous emotion quite new to me, and\r\napproached with rapid steps and leveled gun the outstretched form of the\r\nserpent. Fritz followed me closely.\r\n\r\nJack, somewhat timidly, came several paces behind; while Ernest, after a\r\nlittle hesitation, remained where he was.\r\n\r\nThe monster\'s body was stiff and motionless, which made its rolling and\r\nfiery eyes and the slow, spasmodic undulations of it tail more fearful\r\nby contrast.\r\n\r\nWe fired together, and both balls entered the skull; the light of the\r\neye was extinguished, and the only movement was in the further extremity\r\nof the body, which rolled, writhed, coiled, and lashed from side to\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAdvancing closer, we fired our pistols directly into its head, a\r\nconvulsive quiver ran through the mighty frame, and the boa constrictor\r\nlay dead.\r\n\r\nAs we raised a cry of victory, Jack, desirous of a share in the glory of\r\nconquest, ran close to the creature, firing his pistol into its side,\r\nwhen he was sent sprawling over and over by a movement of its tail,\r\nexcited to a last galvanic effort by the shot.\r\n\r\nBeing in no way hurt, he speedily recovered his feet, and declared he\r\nhad given it its quietus.\r\n\r\n"I hope the terrible noise you made just now was the signal of victory,"\r\nsaid my wife, drawing near, with the utmost circumspection, and holding\r\nFranz tightly by the hand. "I was half afraid to come, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"See this dreadful creature dead at our feet; and let us thank God that\r\nwe have been able to destroy such an enemy."\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done with him now?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n"Let us get him stuffed," said Fritz, "and set him up in the museum\r\namong our shells and corals."\r\n\r\n"Did anybody ever think of eating serpents?" inquired Franz.\r\n\r\n"Of course not!" said his mother. "Why, child, serpents are\r\npoisonous--it would be very dangerous."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, my dear wife," said I. "First of all, the boa is not\r\npoisonous; and then, besides that, the flesh of even poisonous snakes\r\ncan be eaten without danger; as, for instance, the rattlesnake, from\r\nwhich can be made a strong and nourishing soup, tasting very like good\r\nchicken broth--of course, the cook must be told to throw away the head,\r\ncontaining the deadly fangs.\r\n\r\n"It is remarkable that pigs do not fear poisonous snakes, but can kill\r\nand eat them without injury. An instance of this occurs to my memory. A\r\nvessel on Lake Superior, in North America, was wrecked on a small\r\nisland abounding in rattlesnakes, and for that reason uninhabited.\r\n\r\n"The vessel had a cargo of live pigs. The crew escaped to the mainland\r\nin a boat, but the pigs had to be left for some time, till the owner\r\ncould return to fetch them, but with the small hope of finding many left\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n"To his surprise, the animals were not only alive, but remarkably fat\r\nand flourishing, while not a single rattlesnake remained on the island.\r\nThe pigs had clearly eaten the serpents."\r\n\r\n"But might not some other cause have been assigned for their\r\ndisappearance?" asked Ernest. "Suppose, for example, that a great flight\r\nof secretary birds had arrived, they might have cleared the island of\r\nrattlesnakes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what is a secretary bird?" interrupted Franz. "I thought a\r\nsecretary meant a man who wrote letters."\r\n\r\n"So it does, Franz, and the bird Ernest spoke of has curious long\r\nfeathers projecting from either side of its head, something like pens\r\nstuck behind a man\'s ear; hence its name.\r\n\r\n"It is perfectly true that it lives on snakes, lizards, toads, and\r\nfrogs, but, Ernest, I cannot give up my pigs; for, in the first place,\r\nthe secretary bird is an inhabitant of Southern Africa, and is never\r\nseen in North America, neither does it ever fly in a flock; still, so\r\nravenous is its appetite, that, no doubt, even one or two, had they by\r\nsome miracle found themselves on Lake Superior, would have been able to\r\ngive a very good account of the deadly reptiles, and at least shared in\r\nthe glory of their extermination."\r\n\r\nMy wife having gone to prepare dinner, we continued talking as we rested\r\nin the shade of some rocks, near the serpent, for a considerable time.\r\nThe open air was welcome to us after our long imprisonment: and we were,\r\nbesides, desirous to drive off any birds of prey who might be attracted\r\nto the carcass, which we wished to preserve entire.\r\n\r\nMy boys questioned me closely on the subject of serpents in general; and\r\nI described to them the action of the poison fangs; how they folded back\r\non the sides of the upper jaw; and how the poison-secreting glands and\r\nreservoir are found at the back and sides of the head, giving to the\r\nvenomous serpents that peculiar width of head which is so unfailing a\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n"The fangs are hollow," said I, "and when the creature bites, the\r\npressure forces down a tiny drop of the liquid poison which enters the\r\nwound, and, through the veins, quickly spreads over the entire system.\r\nSometimes, if taken in time, cures are effected, but in most cases the\r\nbite of a serpent is followed by speedy death."\r\n\r\nThe children were much interested in my account of the snake-charmers of\r\nIndia, how they fearlessly handle the most deadly of the serpent tribe,\r\nthe Cobra di Capello--or hooded cobra--cause them to move in time to\r\nmusical sounds from a small pipe, twine the reptile about their arms and\r\nbare necks, and then, to prove that the poison fangs have not been\r\nremoved, make them bite a fowl, which soon dies from the effects.\r\n\r\n"How is it possible to extract the fangs, father!" asked Ernest.\r\n\r\n"No instrument is required," replied I; "I have read the account written\r\nby a gentleman in India, who saw a snake-charmer catch a large cobra in\r\nthe jungle, and for the purpose of removing the fangs, hold up a cloth\r\nat which the irritated snake flew, and the fangs being caught in it, the\r\nman seized the reptile by the throat, extracted them, and then squeezed\r\nout the poison, a clear oily substance, upon a leaf."\r\n\r\n"What does the rattle of the rattlesnake look like? and how does it\r\nsound?"\r\n\r\n"At the tip of the tail are a number of curious, loose, horny structures\r\nformed of the same substance as the scales. A very good idea of the\r\nstructure of the rattle may be formed by slipping a number of thimbles\r\nloosely into each other.\r\n\r\n"The rattlesnake lies coiled with its head flat, and the tip of its tail\r\nelevated; when alarmed or irritated it gives a quivering movement to the\r\ntail which causes the joints of the rattle to shake against each other\r\nwith a peculiar sound not easily described; all animals, even horses\r\nnewly brought from Europe, tremble at this noise, and try to escape."\r\n\r\n"What is the best thing to be done for the bite of a serpent?" inquired\r\nFritz.\r\n\r\n"Remedies are very various, very uncertain, and differ with the species\r\ninflicting the bite.\r\n\r\n"Suction, ammonia, oil, the use of the knife, application of fresh mold,\r\nlunar caustic, leaves of certain plants, all these and more are\r\nmentioned. There is a creeping plant, called _Aristolochia indica_, the\r\nleaves of which have in repeated instances done wonders for fearful\r\nbites. It is found in many parts of the world, but most plentifully in\r\nthe hotter regions.\r\n\r\n"A mode of cure adopted by natives of India, Ceylon, and parts of\r\nAfrica, is by the application of a remarkable object called snake-stone.\r\nThese are described as flattish, something like half an almond with\r\nsquared ends, rather light, bearing a very high polish, and of an\r\nintense jetty black.\r\n\r\n"On being bitten by a cobra, the sufferer applies one of these \'stones\'\r\nto each puncture, where they adhere strongly for a time, five or six\r\nminutes being about the average. They seem to absorb the blood as it\r\nflows from the wound, and at last fall off, when the danger is\r\nconsidered to be over.\r\n\r\n"But now we must leave this fertile subject of discussion, and I can\r\nonly say I sincerely trust we may never have cause to resume it from the\r\nappearance of another serpent here of any sort, size, or description.\r\n\r\n"Come, Ernest, can you not give us an epitaph for our unfortunate friend\r\nthe donkey?\r\n\r\n"We must afford him more honorable sepulture than he enjoys at present,\r\nwhen we proceed, as we speedily must, to disembowel his murderer."\r\n\r\nErnest took the matter quite seriously, and planting his elbows on his\r\nknees, he bent his thoughtful brow in his hands, and remained wrapt in\r\npoetic meditation for about two minutes.\r\n\r\n"I have it!" cried he; "but perhaps you will all laugh at me?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, don\'t be shy, old fellow; spit it out!" and thus encouraged by\r\nhis brother, Ernest, with the blush of a modest author, began:\r\n\r\n    "Beneath this stone poor Grizzle\'s bones are laid,\r\n      A faithful ass he was, and loved by all.\r\n    At length, his master\'s voice he disobeyed,\r\n      And thereby came his melancholy fall.\r\n    A monstrous serpent, springing from the grass,\r\n      Seized, crushed, and swallowed him before our eyes\r\n    But we, though yet we mourn our honest ass,\r\n      Are grateful; for he thereby saved the lives\r\n    Of all the human beings on this shore--\r\n      A father, mother, and their children four."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for the epitaph! Well done, Ernest!" resounded on all sides, and\r\ntaking out a large red pencil I used for marking wood, the lines were\r\nforthwith inscribed on a great flat stone, being, as I told the boy, the\r\nvery best poetry that had ever been written on our coast.\r\n\r\nWe then had dinner, and afterward went to work with the serpent.\r\n\r\nThe first operation was to recover the mangled remains of the ass, which\r\nbeing effected, he was buried in the soft marshy ground close by, and\r\nthe hole filled up with fragments of rock.\r\n\r\nThen we yoked Storm and Grumble to the serpent, and dragged it to a\r\nconvenient distance from Rockburg, where the process of skinning,\r\nstuffing, and sewing up again afforded occupation of the deepest\r\ninterest to the boys for several days.\r\n\r\nWe took great pains to coil it round a pole in the museum, arranging\r\nthe head with the jaws wide open, so as to look as alarming as possible,\r\nand contriving to make eyes and tongue sufficiently well to represent\r\nnature; in fact, our dogs never passed the monster without growling, and\r\nmust have wondered at our taste in keeping such a pet.\r\n\r\nOver the entrance leading to the museum and library were inscribed these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    NO ADMITTANCE FOR ASSES.\r\n\r\nThe double meaning of this sentence pleased us all immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n We examine the marsh--A cave discovered--We find the floor covered\r\n     with fuller\'s earth--Discharge our pistols--Jack\'s fright--Ernest\r\n     captures an eel--An expedition toward the Gap--Visit Falconhurst\r\n     and Woodlands and examine the country round--Franz shoots a\r\n     capybara--Ernest and Knips fight the rats--A lecture on\r\n     musk--Cinnamon apples--A peccary hunt--We prepare the peccary\r\n     meat--Disasters at Prospect Hill--An exploring expedition through\r\n     the Gap--We find our barrier broken down across the\r\n     desert--Strange objects in the distance--An account of\r\n     ostriches--An ostrich slain--We discover the nest--A mud\r\n     tortoise--We encounter bears--A desperate fight--Back again to\r\n     camp--We skin the bears and smoke their flesh--Pepper found--Three\r\n     of the boys start on an expedition--I discover talc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger to which we had yet been exposed was now over, but\r\nthere remained much anxiety in my mind lest another serpent might,\r\nunseen by us, have entered the swamp, or might appear, as this had done,\r\nfrom the country beyond Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nI projected then two excursions, the first to make a thorough\r\nexamination of the thicket and morass; the next right away to the Gap,\r\nthrough which alone the archenemy could have entered our territory.\r\n\r\nOn summoning my sons to accompany me to the marsh, I found neither\r\nErnest nor Jack very eager to do so, the latter vowing he had the cold\r\nshivers each time he thought how his ribs might have been smashed by the\r\nlast flap of the snake\'s tail; but I did not yield to their reluctance,\r\nand we finally set about crossing the marsh by placing planks and wicker\r\nhurdles on the ground, and changing their places as we advanced.\r\n\r\nNothing was discovered beyond tracks in the reeds and the creature\'s\r\nlair; where the rushes, grass, and bog-plants were beaten down.\r\n\r\nEmerging beyond the thicket we found ourselves on firm ground, near the\r\nprecipitous wall of rock, and perceived a clear sparkling brook flowing\r\nfrom an opening, which proved to be a cave or grotto of considerable\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe vaulted roof was covered with stalactites, while many formed stately\r\npillars, which seemed as though supporting the roof. The floor was\r\nstrewn with fine snow-white earth, with a smooth soapy feeling, which I\r\nfelt convinced was fuller\'s earth.\r\n\r\n"Well, this is a pleasant discovery!" said I. "This is as good as soap\r\nfor washing, and will save me the trouble of turning soap-boiler."\r\n\r\nPerceiving that the streamlet flowed from an opening of some width in\r\nthe inner rock, Fritz passed through, in order to trace it to its\r\nsource, presently shouting to me that the opening widened very much, and\r\nbegging me to follow him.\r\n\r\nI did so, leaving the other boys in the outer cave, and fired a\r\npistol-shot--the reverberating echoes of which testified to the great\r\nextent of the place; and lighting the bit of candle I always carried\r\nwith me, we advanced, the light burning clear and steadily, though\r\nshedding a very feeble light in so vast a space.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Fritz exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"I verily believe this is a second cave of salt! See how the walls\r\nglance! and how the light is reflected from the roof!"\r\n\r\n"These cannot be salt crystals," said I; "the water which flows over\r\nthem leaves no track, and tastes quite sweet. I am rather inclined to\r\nbelieve that we have penetrated into a cave of rock crystal!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, how splendid! Then we have discovered a great treasure!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if we could make any use of it; otherwise, in our situation,\r\nit is about as valuable as the lump of gold found by good old Robinson\r\nCrusoe."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, I will break off a piece for a specimen. See, here is a fine\r\nbit, only rather dull, and not transparent; what a pity! I must knock\r\noff another."\r\n\r\n"You must go more carefully to work, or it will look as dull as the\r\nfirst. You destroyed its true form, which is that of a pyramid, with six\r\nsides or faces."\r\n\r\nWe remained some time in this interesting grotto, but our light burnt\r\nlow after we had examined it in different directions; and Fritz having\r\nsecured a large lump, which exhibited several crystals in perfection, we\r\nquitted the place, Fritz discharging a farewell shot for the sake of\r\nhearing the grand echoes.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the open air we saw poor Jack sobbing bitterly, but as soon\r\nas we appeared he ran joyfully toward us, and threw himself into my\r\narms.\r\n\r\n"My child, what is the matter?" I cried anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought you were lost! I heard a noise twice, as if the rocks had\r\nshattered down; and I thought you and Fritz were crushed in the ruins!\r\nIt was horrible! How glad I am to see you!"\r\n\r\nI comforted the child, and explained the noises he had heard, inquiring\r\nwhy he was alone?\r\n\r\n"Ernest is over there among the reeds: I daresay he did not hear the\r\nshots."\r\n\r\nI found Ernest busily engaged in weaving a basket in which to catch\r\nfish; he had devised it ingeniously, with a funnel-shaped entrance;\r\nthrough which the fish passing would not easily find their way out, but\r\nwould remain swimming about in the wide part of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n"I shot a young serpent while you were away, father," said he. "It lies\r\nthere covered with rushes; it is nearly four feet long, and as thick as\r\nmy arm."\r\n\r\n"A serpent!" cried I, hurrying toward it in alarm, and fearing there\r\nmust be a brood of them in the swamp after all.\r\n\r\n"A fine large eel, you mean, my boy. This will provide an excellent\r\nsupper for us to-night. I am glad you had the courage to kill it,\r\ninstead of taking to your heels and fleeing from the supposed serpent."\r\n\r\n"Well, I thought it would be so horrid to be pursued and caught that I\r\npreferred facing it; my shot took effect, but it was very difficult to\r\nkill the creature outright, it moved about although its head was\r\nsmashed."\r\n\r\n"The tenacity of life possessed by eels is very remarkable," I said. "I\r\nhave heard that the best mode of killing them is to grasp them by the\r\nneck and slap their tails smartly against a stone or post."\r\n\r\nWe made our way back more easily by keeping close to the cliffs, where\r\nthe ground was firmer, and found the mother washing clothes at the\r\nfountain. She rejoiced greatly at our safe return, and was much pleased\r\nwith the supply of fuller\'s earth, as she said there was now very little\r\nsoap left. The eel was cooked for supper, and during the evening a full\r\naccount was given of our passage through the swamp, and discovery of the\r\nrock-crystal cavern.\r\n\r\nIt was most important to ascertain whether any serpent lurked among the\r\nwoods of our little territory between the cliffs and the sea.\r\nPreparations were set on foot for the second and greater undertaking of\r\na search throughout the country beyond the river, as far as the Gap. I\r\nwished all the family to go on the expedition, a decision which gave\r\nuniversal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIntending to be engaged in this search for several weeks, we took the\r\nsmall tent and a store of all sorts of necessary provisions, as well as\r\nfirearms, tools, cooking utensils, and torches.\r\n\r\nAll these things were packed on the cart, which was drawn by Storm and\r\nGrumble. Jack and Franz mounted them, and acted at once the part of\r\nriders and drivers. My wife sat comfortably in the cart, Fritz rode in\r\nadvance, while Ernest and I walked; we were protected in flank by the\r\ndogs and Fangs, the tame jackal.\r\n\r\nDirecting our course toward Woodlands, we saw many traces of the\r\nserpent\'s approach to Rockburg. In some places, where the soil was\r\nloose, the trail, like a broad furrow, was very evident indeed.\r\n\r\nAt Falconhurst we made a halt, and were, as usual, welcomed by the\r\npoultry, as well as by the sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nWe then passed on to Woodlands, where we arrived at nightfall. All was\r\npeaceful and in good order; no track of the boa in that direction; no\r\nsigns of visits from mischievous apes; the little farm and its\r\ninhabitants looked most flourishing.\r\n\r\nNext day was passed in making a survey of the immediate neighborhood, at\r\nthe same time collecting a quantity of cotton, which was wanted for new\r\npillows and cushions. In the afternoon Franz was my companion, carrying\r\na small gun entrusted to him for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe took Fan and Bruno with us, and went slowly along the left bank of\r\nthe lake, winding our way among reedy thickets, which frequently turned\r\nus aside a considerable distance from the water. The dogs hunted about\r\nin all directions, and raised duck, snipe, and heron. These usually flew\r\ndirectly across the lake so that Franz got no chance of a shot. He began\r\nto get rather impatient, and proposed firing at the black swans we saw\r\nsailing gracefully on the glassy surface of the lake.\r\n\r\nJust then a harsh booming sound struck our ears. I paused in wonder as\r\nto whence the noise proceeded, while Franz exclaimed, "Oh, father, can\r\nthat be Swift, our young onager?"\r\n\r\n"It cannot possibly be Swift," said I; adding, after listening\r\nattentively a minute or two, "I am inclined to think it must be the cry\r\nof a bittern, a fine handsome bird of the nature of a heron."\r\n\r\n"Oh! may I shoot it, father? But I wonder how a bird can make that\r\nroaring noise! One would think it was an ox, it is more like lowing than\r\nbraying."\r\n\r\n"The noise creatures make depends more on the construction of the\r\nwindpipe, its relation to the lungs and the strength of the muscles\r\nwhich force out the breath, than on their size. As, for example, how\r\nloud is the song of the nightingale and the little canary bird. Some\r\npeople say the bittern booms with his long bill partly thrust into the\r\nboggy ground, which increases the hollow muffled sound of its very\r\npeculiar cry."\r\n\r\nFranz was very anxious that the first trophy of his gun should be so\r\nrare a bird as the bittern; the dogs were sent into the wood, and we\r\nwaited some distance apart, in readiness to fire.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a great rustling in the thicket, Franz fired, and\r\nI heard his happy voice calling out:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve hit him! I\'ve hit him!"\r\n\r\n"What have you hit?" shouted I in return.\r\n\r\n"A wild pig," said he; "but bigger than Fritz\'s."\r\n\r\n"Aha! I see you remember the agouti! Perhaps it is not a hog at all but\r\none of our little pigs from the farm. What will the old sow say to you,\r\nFranz?"\r\n\r\nI soon joined my boy, and found him in transports of joy over an animal\r\ncertainly very much like a pig, although its snout was broad and blunt.\r\nIt was covered with bristles, had no tail, and in color was a yellowish\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nExamining it carefully, and noticing its webb feet and its curious\r\nteeth, I decided that it must be a capybara, a water-loving animal of\r\nSouth America, and Franz was overjoyed to find that he had shot "a new\r\ncreature," as he said. It was difficult to carry it home, but he very\r\nsensibly proposed that we should open and clean the carcase, which would\r\nmake it lighter--and then putting it in a game bag, he carried it till\r\nquite tired out; he then asked if I thought Bruno would let him strap it\r\non his back. We found the dog willing to bear the burden, and reached\r\nWoodlands soon afterward.\r\n\r\nThere we were surprised to see Ernest surrounded by a number of large\r\nrats which lay dead on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Where can all these have come from?" exclaimed I. "Have you and your\r\nmother been rat-hunting instead of gathering rice as you intended?"\r\n\r\n"We came upon these creatures quite unexpectedly," he replied, "while in\r\nthe rice swamp. Knips, who was with us, sprang away to a kind of\r\nlong-shaped mound among the reeds, and pounced upon something, which\r\ntried to escape into a hole. He chattered and gnashed his teeth, and the\r\ncreature hissed and squeaked, and running up I found he had got a big\r\nrat by the tail; he would not let go, and the rat could not turn in the\r\nnarrow entrance to bite him, but I soon pulled it out and killed it with\r\nmy stick.\r\n\r\n"The mound was a curious looking erection, so I broke it open with some\r\ndifficulty, and in doing this dislodged quite a dozen of the creatures.\r\nSome I killed, but many plunged into the water and escaped.\r\n\r\n"On examining their dwelling I found it a vaulted tunnel made of clay\r\nand mud, and thickly lined with sedges, rushes, and water-lily leaves.\r\n\r\n"There were other mounds or lodges close by, and seeking an entrance to\r\none I stretched my game bag across it, and then hammered on the roof\r\ntill a whole lot of rats sprang out, several right into the bag. I hit\r\naway right and left, but began to repent of my audacity when I found the\r\nwhole community swarming about in the wildest excitement, some escaping,\r\nbut many stopping in bewilderment, while others actually attacked me.\r\n\r\n"It was anything but pleasant, I assure you, and I began to think of\r\nBishop Hatto in the Mouse Tower on the Rhine. Knips liked it as little\r\nas I did, and skipped about desperately to get out of their way, though\r\nhe now and then seized a rat by the neck in his teeth.\r\n\r\n"Just as I began to shout for help, Juno came dashing through the reeds\r\nand water, and made quick work with the enemy, all flying from her\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n"My mother had great difficulty in forcing her way through the marsh to\r\nthe scene of action, but reached me at last; and we collected all the\r\nslain to show you, and for the sake of their skins."\r\n\r\nThis account excited my curiosity, and I went to examine the place\r\nErnest described: where I found, to my surprise, an arrangement much\r\nlike a beaver dam, though on a small scale, and less complete.\r\n\r\n"You have discovered a colony of beaver rats," said I to Ernest, "so\r\ncalled from their resemblance in skill and manner of life to that\r\nwonderful creature.\r\n\r\n"Muskrat, musquash, and ondatra are other names given to them. They\r\nhave, you see, webbed feet and flattened tails, and we shall find that\r\nthey carry two small glands containing the scented substance called\r\nmusk. The sooner we strip off the skins the better; they will be useful\r\nfor making caps."\r\n\r\nWe went back to the house, and met Fritz and Jack just returned from\r\ntheir excursion, reporting that no trace of serpents, great or small,\r\nhad been met with.\r\n\r\nJack carried in his hat about a dozen eggs; and Fritz had shot a couple\r\nof heath fowls, a cock and hen.\r\n\r\nWe sat down to supper, Franz eager to partake of his capybara. Even he\r\nhimself made a face at the peculiar flavor of the meat.\r\n\r\n"It is the musk which you taste," said I; and I described to them the\r\nvarious animals in which this strange liquid is found; the musk deer,\r\nmusk ox, crocodile, muskrat of India (also called coudeli, which taints\r\na corked bottle of wine, if it only runs across it), concluding with an\r\naccount of the civet, called also civet-cat.\r\n\r\n"The civet," said I, "is a handsome black and white animal, and the\r\nperfume obtained from it was formerly considered a valuable medicine; in\r\nthe present day it is used chiefly as a scent. This odoriferous\r\nsubstance is secreted, _i. e._, formed, in a double glandular pouch near\r\nthe tail, and the Dutch keep the creature in captivity, so that it shall\r\nafford them a continual supply.\r\n\r\n"The method of removing the civet perfume is ingenious. The animal is\r\nvery quick and elastic in its movements, and having sharp teeth it is\r\nnot pleasant to handle. So it is put into a long, narrow cage in which\r\nit cannot turn round, a horn spoon is then introduced, and the perfume,\r\na thick, oily stuff something like butter, is coolly scraped from the\r\npouch, the plundered civet being then released from strait durance,\r\nuntil the supply is reformed."\r\n\r\nPresently Jack ran for his game bag, producing some fruit which he had\r\nforgotten. Several pale green apples, quite new to us, excited general\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n"Why, what are those? Are they good?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I hope so, for we sadly want something to take away the taste of\r\nFranz\'s beast," said Jack: "but Fritz and I were afraid of eating some\r\nawful poison or other, like the manchineel, so we brought them for the\r\ninspection of the learned master Knips."\r\n\r\nI took one and cut it in two, remarking that it contained a circle of\r\nseeds or pips, instead of the stone of the manchineel. At that moment\r\nKnips slyly came behind me, and snatching up one half, began to munch it\r\nwith the liveliest satisfaction, an example which the boys were so eager\r\nto follow that a general scramble ensued, and I had some trouble in\r\nsecuring a couple of apples for myself and their mother.\r\n\r\nI imagined this to be the cinnamon apple of the Antilles.\r\n\r\nEvery one seeming wearied by the fatigues of the day, our mattresses and\r\npillows were arranged, and the inmates of Woodlands betook themselves to\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nWith early light we commenced the next day\'s journey, directing our\r\ncourse to a point between the sugar-brake and the Gap, where we had once\r\nmade a sort of arbor of the branches of trees; as this remained in\r\npretty good condition, we spread a sailcloth over the top of it, instead\r\nof pitching the tent, and made it very comfortable quarters for the\r\nshort time I proposed to stay there.\r\n\r\nOur object being to search the neighborhood for traces of the boa\r\nconstrictor, or any of his kindred, Fritz, Jack, and Franz went with me\r\nto the sugar-cane brake, and satisfied ourselves that our enemy had not\r\nbeen there. It was long since we had enjoyed the fresh juice of these\r\ncanes, and we were refreshing ourselves therewith, when a loud barking\r\nof dogs, and loud rustling and rattling through the thicket of canes,\r\ndisturbed our pleasant occupation, and, as we could see nothing a yard\r\noff where we stood, I hurried to the open ground, and with guns in\r\nreadiness we awaited what was coming.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes a herd of creatures like little pigs issued from the\r\nthicket, and made off in single file at a brisk trot; they were of a\r\nuniform gray color, and showed short sharp tusks.\r\n\r\nMy trusty double-barrel speedily laid low two of the fugitives; the\r\nothers continued to follow the leader in line, scarcely turning aside to\r\npass the dead bodies of their comrades, and maintaining the same steady\r\npace, although Fritz and Jack also fired and killed several.\r\n\r\nI felt certain that these were peccaries, and recollected that an\r\nodoriferous gland in the back must be removed immediately, otherwise the\r\nmeat will become tainted, and quite unfit to eat. This operation, with\r\nthe help of my boys, I accordingly performed at once.\r\n\r\nPresently, hearing shots in the direction of the hut where we had left\r\nErnest and his mother, I sent Jack to their assistance, desiring him to\r\nfetch the cart, that the booty might be conveyed to our encampment,\r\nemploying the time of his absence in opening and cleaning the animals,\r\nthus reducing their weight.\r\n\r\nErnest came back with Jack and the cart, and told us that the procession\r\nof peccaries had passed near the hut, and that he, with Juno\'s help, had\r\nsecured three of them.\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear this, as I had determined to cure a good supply of\r\nhams, and we made haste to load the cart; the boys adorned it with\r\nflowers and green boughs, and with songs of triumph which made the woods\r\nring they conveyed the valuable supply of game to the hut, where their\r\nmother anxiously waited for us.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we set to work upon our pigs, singeing and scalding off the\r\nbristles; I cut out the hams, divided the flitches, bestowed\r\nconsiderable portions of the carcass on the dogs, and diligently\r\ncleansed and salted the meat, while the boys prepared a shed, where it\r\nwas to be hung to be cured in the smoke of fires of green wood.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected business of course detained us in the place for some\r\ntime. On the second day, when the smoking shed was ready, the boys were\r\nanxious to cook the smallest porker in the Otaheitian fashion. For this\r\npurpose they dug a hole, in which they burned a quantity of dry grass,\r\nsticks, and weeds, heating stones, which were placed round the sides of\r\nthe pit.\r\n\r\nWhile the younger boys made ready the oven, Fritz singed and washed his\r\npeccary, stuffing it with potatoes, onions, and herbs, and a good\r\nsprinkling of salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nHe then sewed up the opening, and enveloped the pig in large leaves to\r\nguard it from the ashes and dust of its cooking place.\r\n\r\nThe fire no longer blazed, but the embers and stones were glowing hot;\r\nthe pig was carefully placed in the hole, covered over with hot ashes,\r\nand the hole with earth, so that it looked like a big mole heap.\r\n\r\nDinner was looked forward to with curiosity, as well as appetite; my\r\nwife, as usual, distrusting our experiments, was not sanguine of\r\nsuccess, and made ready some plain food as a _pis aller_.\r\n\r\nShe was well pleased with the curing-hut, which was roomy enough to hang\r\nall our hams and bacon. On a wide hearth in the middle we kindled a\r\nlarge fire, which was kept constantly smouldering by heaping it with\r\ndamp grass and green wood. The hut being closed in above, the smoke\r\nfilled it, and penetrated the meat thoroughly; this process it had to\r\nundergo for several days.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours Fritz gave notice that he was going to open his oven.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement prevailed as he removed the earth, turf, and stones,\r\nand a delicious appetizing odor arose from the opening. It was the smell\r\nof roast pork, certainly, but with a flavor of spices which surprised\r\nme, until I thought of the leaves in which the food had been wrapped up.\r\n\r\nThe peccary was carefully raised, and when a few cinders were picked\r\noff, it looked a remarkably well-cooked dish. Fritz was highly\r\ncomplimented on his success, even by his mother.\r\n\r\nThe scented leaves were, I thought, those of a tree which I knew to be\r\nfound in Madagascar, called by the natives ravensara, or "good leaf." It\r\nis said to combine the scent of the nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon. The\r\nfruit is a species of nut, possessing the scent of the leaves in a more\r\ndelicate degree, and from it an oil or essence is distilled, which is\r\nhighly valued in native cookery.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of curing our large supply of hams and bacon, which\r\noccupied several days, we roamed about the neighborhood in all\r\ndirections, finding no trace of the serpent, but making many valuable\r\nacquisitions, among which were some gigantic bamboos, from fifty to\r\nsixty feet in length and of proportionate thickness. These, when cut\r\nacross near the joints, formed capital casks, tubs and pots; while the\r\nlong sharp thorns, which begirt the stem at intervals, were as strong\r\nand useful as iron nails.\r\n\r\nOne day we made an excursion to the farm at Prospect Hill, and were\r\ngrievously provoked to find that the vagabond apes had been there, and\r\nwrought terrible mischief, as before at Woodlands.\r\n\r\nThe animals and poultry were scattered, and everything in the cottage so\r\ntorn and dirtied, that it was vain to think of setting things right that\r\nday. We therefore very unwillingly left the disorder as we found it,\r\npurposing to devote time to the work afterward.\r\n\r\nWhen all was in readiness for the prosecution of our journey, we closed\r\nand barricaded the hut, in which, for the present, we left the store of\r\nbacon; and arranging our march in the usual patriarchal style, we took\r\nour way to the Gap, the thorough defense of which defile was the main\r\nobject we had in view.\r\n\r\nOur last halting-place being much enclosed by shrubs, bamboos, and\r\nbrushwood, we had during our stay opened a path through the cane thicket\r\nin the direction we were about to travel; this we now found of the\r\ngreatest assistance, and the loaded cart passed on without impediment.\r\n\r\nThe ground was open and tolerably level beyond, so that in a few hours\r\nwe arrived at the extreme limit of our coast territory.\r\n\r\nWe halted on the outskirts of a little wood, behind which, to the right,\r\nrose the precipitous and frowning cliffs of the mountain gorge, while to\r\nthe left flowed the torrent, leaving between it and the rocks the narrow\r\npass we called the Gap, and passing outward to mingle its water with the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe wood afforded us pleasant shelter, and standing high and within\r\ngunshot of the mouth of the rocky pass, I resolved to make it our\r\ncamping place. We therefore unpacked the cart, and made our usual\r\narrangements for safety and comfort, not forgetting to examine the wood\r\nitself, so as to ascertain whether it harbored any dangerous animals.\r\n\r\nNothing worse than wild cats was discovered. We disturbed several of\r\nthese creatures in their pursuit of birds and small game, but they fled\r\nat our approach.\r\n\r\nBy the time dinner was ready we felt much fatigued, and some hours of\r\nunusually sultry and oppressive heat compelled us to rest until toward\r\nevening, when returning coolness revived our strength. We pitched the\r\ntent, and then occupied ourselves with preparations for the next day,\r\nwhen it was my intention to penetrate the country beyond the defile, and\r\nmake a longer excursion across the Savannah than had yet been\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for a start at an early hour; my brave wife consented to\r\nremain in camp with Franz as her companion, while the three elder boys,\r\nand all the dogs, except Juno, went with me.\r\n\r\nWe expected to find it somewhat difficult to make our way through the\r\nnarrowest part of the pass, which had been so strongly barricaded and\r\nplanted with thorny shrubs, but found on the contrary that the fences\r\nand walls were broken down and disarranged. It was thus very evident\r\nthat the great snake, as well as the herd of peccaries, had made an\r\nentrance here.\r\n\r\nThis barricade was the first check that had been placed by hand of man\r\nupon the wild free will of nature in this lonely place.\r\n\r\nWith one consent storms, floods, torrents, and the wild beasts of the\r\nforest, had set themselves to destroy it.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to make the defenses doubly strong, being convinced that the\r\nposition was capable of being barricaded and fortified so as to resist\r\nthe invaders we dreaded.\r\n\r\nThe prospect which opened before us on emerging from the rocky pass was\r\nwide and varied. Swelling hills and verdant wooded vales were seen on\r\none hand, while a great plain stretched before us, extending from the\r\nbanks of the river toward a chain of lofty mountains, whose summits were\r\nrendered indistinct in the haze of the distance.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the stream, which we named East River, filling our flasks\r\nwith water, and it was well we did so, for in continuing our journey, we\r\nfound the soil become more arid and parched than we had expected; in\r\nfact we soon appeared surrounded by a desert.\r\n\r\nThe boys were astonished at the altered appearance of the country, part\r\nof which had been explored when we met with the buffaloes. I reminded\r\nthem of the difference of the season; that the expedition had been made\r\ndirectly after the rains, when vegetation had clothed with transient\r\nbeauty this region, which, possessing no source of moisture itself, had\r\nbecome scathed and bare during the blazing heat of summer.\r\n\r\nOur march proceeded slowly, and many were the uncomplimentary remarks\r\nmade on the "new country."\r\n\r\nIt was "Arabia Petrea," groaned one. "Desert of Sahara," sighed another.\r\n"Fit abode for demons," muttered a third. "Subterranean volcanic fires\r\nare raging beneath our feet."\r\n\r\n"Patience, my dear fellows!" cried I; "you are too easily discouraged.\r\nLook beyond the toilsome way to those grand mountains, whose spurs are\r\nalready stretching forward to meet us. Who knows what pleasant surprises\r\nawait us amid their steep declivities? I, for my part, expect to find\r\nwater, fresh grass, trees, and a lovely resting-place."\r\n\r\nWe were all glad to repose beneath the shade of the first over-hanging\r\nrock we came to, although, by pressing further upward, we might have\r\nattained to a pleasanter spot.\r\n\r\nLooking back toward the Gap, we marked the strange contrast of the\r\nsmiling country bordering the river, and the dreary, monotonous plain we\r\nhad traversed.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing on the distant scene, we produced our store of provisions,\r\nand were busily engaged, when Knips (our constant companion) suddenly\r\nbegan to snuff and smell about in a very ridiculous way; finally, with a\r\nshriek which we knew was expressive of pleasure, he set off at a full\r\nspeed, followed by all the dogs, up a sort of glen behind us.\r\n\r\nWe left them to their own devices, being far too pleasantly engaged with\r\nour refreshments to care much what fancy the little rogue had got in his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nWhen hunger was somewhat appeased, Fritz once more cast his eyes over\r\nthe expanse of plain before us, and after looking fixedly for a moment,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that I see a party of horsemen riding at full gallop\r\ntoward us! Can they be wild Arabs of the desert?"\r\n\r\n"Arabs my boy! certainly not; but take the spyglass and make them out\r\nexactly. We shall have to be on our guard, whatever they are!"\r\n\r\n"I cannot see distinctly enough to be sure," said he presently, "and\r\nimagination supplies the deficiency of sight in most strange fashion. I\r\ncould fancy them wild cattle, loaded carts, wandering haycocks, in fact\r\nmost anything I like."\r\n\r\nThe spyglass passed from hand to hand; Jack and Ernest agreed in\r\nthinking the moving objects were men on horseback; but when it came to\r\nmy turn to look, I at once pronounced them to be very large ostriches.\r\n\r\n"This is fortunate, indeed!" I exclaimed; "we must try to secure one of\r\nthese magnificent birds; the feathers alone are worth having."\r\n\r\n"A live ostrich, father! that would be splendid. Why, we might ride upon\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nAs the ostriches approached, we began to consider in what way we should\r\nattempt a capture. I sent Fritz and Jack to recall the dogs, and placed\r\nmyself with Ernest behind some shrubs which would conceal us from the\r\nbirds as they came onward.\r\n\r\nThe boys did not rejoin us for some little time; they found Knips and\r\nthe dogs at a pool of water formed by a small mountain stream, which the\r\nmonkey\'s instinct had detected; his sudden departure was thus accounted\r\nfor, and they availed themselves right gladly of his discovery, filling\r\ntheir flasks, and hastily bathing before their return.\r\n\r\nThe ostriches continued to come in our direction, varying their pace as\r\nthough in sport, springing, trotting, galloping, and chasing each other\r\nround and round, so that their approach was by no means rapid.\r\n\r\nI could now perceive that of the five birds one only was a male, the\r\nwhite plumes of the wings and tail contrasting finely with the deep\r\nglossy black of the neck and body.\r\n\r\nThe color of the females being ashen brown, the effect of their white\r\nplumes was not so handsome.\r\n\r\n"I do not believe we shall have a chance with these birds," said I,\r\n"except by sending Fritz\'s eagle in pursuit; and for that we must bide\r\nour time, and let them come as near as possible."\r\n\r\n"In what way, then, are ostriches caught by the natives of the African\r\ndeserts?" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes by chase on horseback; but their speed is so very great, that\r\neven that must be conducted by stratagem.\r\n\r\n"When these birds are pursued, they will run for hours in a wide circle;\r\nthe hunter gallops after them, but describes a much smaller circle, and\r\ncan therefore maintain the pace for a longer time, waiting to make the\r\nattack until the bird is fatigued.\r\n\r\n"Among the Bushmen, the hunter sometimes envelopes himself in the skin\r\nof an ostrich, his legs doing duty for those of the bird, and his arm\r\nmanaging the head and neck so as to imitate the movements of the bird\r\nwhen feeding. The enterprising hunter is thus enabled to get among a\r\nflock of ostriches, and to shoot them with arrows one after another.\r\n\r\n"When aware of an enemy they defend themselves desperately, using their\r\npowerful legs as weapons, always kicking forward, and inflicting\r\ndreadful injuries on dogs, and even on men, if attacked without due\r\nprecaution. But let us take up our positions, and keep perfectly still,\r\nfor the ostriches are at hand!"\r\n\r\nWe held the dogs concealed as much as possible; the stately birds\r\nsuddenly perceiving us, paused, hesitated, and appeared uneasy. Yet as\r\nno movement was made, they drew a few steps nearer, with outstretched\r\nnecks, examining curiously the unwonted spectacle before them.\r\n\r\nThe dogs became impatient, struggled from our grasp, and furiously\r\nrushed toward our astonished visitors. In an instant they turned and\r\nfled with the speed of the wind; their feet seemed not to touch the\r\nground, their wings aiding the marvelously rapid progress.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they would have been beyond our reach, but as they\r\nturned to fly the eagle was unhooded. Singling out the male bird the\r\nfalcon made his fatal swoop, and piercing the skull, the magnificent\r\ncreature was laid low. Before we could reach the spot the dogs had\r\njoined the bird of prey, and were fiercely tearing the flesh and\r\nbedabbling the splendid plumes with gore.\r\n\r\nThe sight grieved us.\r\n\r\n"What a pity we could not capture this glorious bird alive!" exclaimed\r\nFritz, as we took its beautiful feathers; "it must, I am sure, have\r\nstood more than six feet high, and two of us might have mounted him at\r\nonce!"\r\n\r\n"In the vast sandy deserts where nothing grows, what can flocks of these\r\nbirds find to live upon?" inquired Ernest.\r\n\r\n"That would indeed be hard to say, if the deserts were utterly barren\r\nand unfruitful," returned I; "but over these sandy wastes a beneficent\r\nProvidence scatters plants of wild melons, which absorb and retain every\r\ndrop of moisture, and which quench the thirst as well as satisfy the\r\nhunger of the ostriches and other inhabitants of the wilds. These\r\nmelons, however, do not constitute his entire diet; he feeds freely on\r\ngrasses, dates, and hard grain, when he can obtain them."\r\n\r\n"Does the ostrich utter any cry?"\r\n\r\n"The voice of the ostrich is a deep, hollow, rumbling sound, so much\r\nresembling the roar of a lion as to be occasionally mistaken for it. But\r\nwhat does Jack mean by waving his cap and beckoning in that excited\r\nfashion? What has the boy found, I wonder!"\r\n\r\nHe ran a little toward us, shouting:\r\n\r\n"Eggs, father! Ostriches\' eggs! a huge nest full--do come quick!"\r\n\r\nWe all hastened to the spot, and in a slight hollow of the ground beheld\r\nmore than twenty eggs, as large as an infant\'s head.\r\n\r\nThe idea of carrying more than two away with us was preposterous,\r\nalthough the boys, forgetting what the weight would be, seriously\r\ncontemplated clearing the nest.\r\n\r\nThey were satisfied when a kind of landmark had been set up, so that if\r\nwe returned we might easily find the nest.\r\n\r\nAs each egg weighed about three pounds, the boys soon found the burden\r\nconsiderable, even when tied into a handkerchief and carried like a\r\nbasket. To relieve them, I cut a strong elastic heath stick, and\r\nsuspending an egg in its sling at each end, laid the bent stick over\r\nJack\'s shoulder, and like a Dutch dairy-maid with her milk pails, he\r\nstepped merrily along without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nWe presently reached a marshy place, surrounding a little pool evidently\r\nfed by the stream which Knips had discovered. The soft ground was\r\ntrodden and marked by the footsteps of many different sorts of animals;\r\nwe saw tracks of buffaloes, antelopes, onagas or quaggas, but no trace\r\nwhatever of any kind of serpent; hitherto our journey in search of\r\nmonster reptiles had been signalized by very satisfactory failure.\r\n\r\nBy this brook we sat down to rest and take some food; Fangs presently\r\ndisappeared, and Jack calling to his pet discovered him gnawing at\r\nsomething which he had dug from the marsh. Taking it for a root of some\r\nsort, Jack brought it for my inspection. I dipped it in water to clear\r\noff the mud, and to my surprise found a queer little living creature, no\r\nbigger than half an apple, in my hand. It was a small tortoise.\r\n\r\n"A tortoise, I declare!" cried Fritz. "What a long way from the sea. How\r\ncame it here, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps there has been a tortoise-shower," remarked Ernest. "One reads\r\nof frog-showers in the time of the ancient Romans."\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Professor! you\'re out for once," said I. "This is nothing but a\r\nmud-tortoise, which lives in wet, marshy ground and fresh water. They\r\nare useful in gardens; for although they like a few lettuce leaves now\r\nand then, they will destroy numbers of snails, grubs, and worms."\r\n\r\nResuming our journey, we arrived at a charming valley, verdant,\r\nfruitful, and shaded by clumps of graceful trees. It afforded us the\r\ngreatest delight and refreshment to pass along this cool and lovely\r\nvale, which we agreed to call Glen Verdant.\r\n\r\nIn the distance we could see herds of antelopes or buffaloes feeding;\r\nbut as our dogs continually ranged a long way ahead of us, they were\r\nquickly startled, and vanished up one or other of the narrow gorges\r\nwhich opened out of the valley.\r\n\r\nFollowing the imperceptible windings of the vale, we were surprised, on\r\nquitting it for the more open ground, to find ourselves in a country we\r\nwere already acquainted with, and not far from the Jackal Cave, as we\r\ncalled the place where Fangs had been captured in cubhood.\r\n\r\nOn recognizing the spot, Ernest, who was in advance with one of the\r\ndogs, hastened toward it. We lost sight of him for a few minutes, and\r\nthen arose a cry of terror, violent barking, and deep, surly growls.\r\n\r\nAs we rushed forward, Ernest met us, looking white as ashes, and calling\r\nout:\r\n\r\n"A bear, a bear, father! He is coming after me!"\r\n\r\nThe boy clung to me in mortal fear. I felt his whole frame quivering.\r\n\r\n"Courage, my son!" cried I, disengaging myself from his grasp; "we must\r\nprepare for instant defense!"\r\n\r\nThe dogs dashed forward to join the fray, whatever it was; and not long\r\nwere we in doubt. To my no small consternation, an enormous bear made\r\nhis appearance, quickly followed by another.\r\n\r\nWith leveled guns, my brave Fritz and I advanced slowly to meet them.\r\nJack was also ready to fire, but the shock had so unnerved Ernest that\r\nhe fairly took to his heels. We fired together, one at each bear; but\r\nthough hit, the monsters were unfortunately only wounded. We found it\r\nmost difficult to take aim, as the dogs beset them on all sides.\r\nHowever, they were much disabled, one having the lower jaw broken, and\r\nthe other, with a bullet in his shoulder, was effectually lamed. The\r\ndogs, perceiving their advantage, pressed more closely round their foes,\r\nwho yet defended themselves furiously, with frightful yells of pain and\r\nrage. Such was the confusion and perpetual movement of the struggle,\r\nthat I dared not fire again, seeing that even slightly wounding one of\r\nour gallant hounds would instantly place him in the power of the raging\r\nbears.\r\n\r\nWatching our opportunity, we suddenly advanced with loaded pistols to\r\nwithin a very few paces of the animals, and firing, both fell dead, one\r\nshot through the head, the other, in the act of rearing to spring on\r\nFritz, received his charge in its heart.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" cried I, as with dull groans the brutes sank to the\r\nground. "We have escaped the greatest peril we have yet encountered!"\r\n\r\nThe dogs continued to tear and worry the fallen foe, as though unwilling\r\nto trust the appearance of death. With feelings somewhat akin, I drew my\r\nhunting-knife, and made assurance doubly sure.\r\n\r\nSeeing all safe, Jack raised a shout of victory, that poor Ernest might\r\ngain courage to approach the scene of conflict, which at last he did,\r\nand joined us in examining the dangerous animals, as they lay motionless\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nEvery point was full of interest, their wounds, their sharp teeth, their\r\nmighty claws, the extraordinary strength of neck and shoulder, all were\r\nremarked and commented on, and observing that the shaded brown hair was\r\ntipped with glossy white, I thought that these might be the silver bears\r\nmentioned in Captain Clarke\'s journey to the northwest coasts of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n"Well, my lads," said I, "if we have failed to catch sight of serpents,\r\nwe have at least made good riddance of some other bad rubbish! These\r\nfellows would one day have worked us woe, or I am much mistaken. What\'s\r\nto be done next?"\r\n\r\n"Why, skin them, to be sure," said Fritz. "We shall have a couple of\r\nsplendid bearskin rugs."\r\n\r\nAs this process would take time and evening drew on, we dragged the huge\r\ncarcasses into their den, to await our return, concealing them with\r\nboughs of trees and fencing the entrance as well as we could. The\r\nostrich eggs we also left behind us, hidden in a sandy hole.\r\n\r\nBy sunset we reached the tent, and joyfully rejoined the mother and\r\nFranz, right glad to find a hearty meal prepared for us, as well as a\r\nlarge heap of brushwood for the watch-fire.\r\n\r\nWhen a full account of our adventures had been given, with a minute and\r\nspecial description of the bear fight, the mother related what she had\r\ndone during our absence. She and Franz had made their way through the\r\nwood up to the rocks behind it, and discovered a bed of pure white clay,\r\nwhich it seemed to her might be used for making porcelain. Then she had\r\ncontrived a drinking trough for the cattle out of a split bamboo.\r\n\r\nShe had arranged a hearth in a sheltered place by building up large\r\nstones, cemented with the white clay; and, finally, she had cut a\r\nquantity of canes and brought them, on the cart, to be in readiness for\r\nthe building we had in hand.\r\n\r\nI praised the thoughtful diligence which had effected so much that was\r\nof real and definite use. In order to try the clay, I put some balls of\r\nit in the fire now kindled, to burn during the night, and we then betook\r\nourselves to rest under shelter of our tent.\r\n\r\nI awoke at dawn and aroused my little party. My first idea was to\r\nexamine the clay balls, which I found baked hard and finely glazed, but\r\ntoo much melted down by the heat--a fault which, seeing the excellent\r\nquality of the clay, I knew it would be well worth while to remedy.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, and our accustomed devotions, we harnessed the cart,\r\nand took the way to the bears\' den. Fritz headed the party, and, coming\r\nin sight of the entrance to the cave, called out softly:\r\n\r\n"Make haste and you will see a whole crowd of wild turkeys, who seem to\r\nhave come to attend the funeral obsequies of their respected friend and\r\nneighbor, Bruin, here. But there appears to be a jealous watcher who is\r\nunwilling to admit the visitors to the bed of state!"\r\n\r\nThe Watcher, as Fritz called him, was an immensely large bird, with a\r\nsort of comb on his head, and a loose, fleshy skin hanging from beneath\r\nthe beak. Part of the neck was bare, wrinkled, and purplish-red, while\r\naround it, resting on the shoulders, was a downy collar of soft, white\r\nfeathers. The plumage was grayish-brown, marked here and there with\r\nwhite patches; the feet appeared to be armed with strong claws. This\r\ngreat bird guarded the entrance to the cave, occasionally retiring into\r\nit himself for a few minutes; but as soon as the other birds came\r\npressing in after him, he hurried out again, and they were forced to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nWe stopped to observe this curious scene, and were startled suddenly by\r\na mighty rush of wings in the air above us. We looked up; at the same\r\nmoment Fritz fired, and an enormous bird fell heavily head foremost on\r\nthe rocks, by which its neck was broken, while blood flowed from a wound\r\nin the breast.\r\n\r\nWe had been holding back the dogs, but they, with Fritz, now rushed\r\ntoward the cave, the birds rising around them and departing with heavy,\r\nungainly flight, leaving only Fritz\'s prize, and one of the other birds\r\nkilled by the large one in its fall.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost caution I entered the cave, and rejoiced to find that\r\nthe tongue and eyes only of the bears had been devoured; a little later\r\nand we should have had the handsome skins pecked and torn to rags, and\r\nall chance of steaks and bears\' paws gone.\r\n\r\nOn measuring the wings of the large bird from tip to tip, I found the\r\nlength exceeded eleven feet, and concluded it to be a condor; it was\r\nevidently the mate of the "Watcher," as Fritz called the first we saw.\r\n\r\nTo work we now went on the bears, and no slight affair we found it to\r\nskin and cut them up, but by dint of perseverance, we at last succeeded\r\nin our object.\r\n\r\nDetermining to smoke the meat on the spot, we cut magnificent hams, and\r\ntook off the rest of the meat in slices after the manner of the\r\nbuccaneers in the West Indies, preserving the paws entire to be cooked\r\nas a delicacy, and obtaining from the two bears together a prodigious\r\nsupply of lard, which my wife gladly undertook to melt and prepare for\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nThe bones and offal we drew to some distance with the help of our\r\ncattle, and made the birds of the air most welcome to feast upon it.\r\nThis, with the assistance of all sorts of insects, they did so\r\neffectually that before we left the place the skulls were picked\r\nperfectly clean, the sun had dried them, and they were ready for us to\r\ncarry off to our museum.\r\n\r\nThe skins had to be very carefully scraped, washed, salted, cleansed\r\nwith ashes, and dried; which occupied fully two days.\r\n\r\nI was lamenting our distance from the rascusara tree, the leaves of\r\nwhich had flavored our roast peccary so nicely, when I observed among\r\nthe brushwood which the boys had brought from the thickets around us, a\r\nclimbing plant, whose leaves had a very strong smell; the stem resembled\r\na vine, and the fruit grew in clusters like currants. Some were red, and\r\nsome of a green color, which I supposed to denote various degrees of\r\nripeness. They were hard, and the outer skin was quite thin.\r\n\r\nI recognized in this the pepper plant, a discovery particularly\r\nagreeable at this moment.\r\n\r\nThe boys soon gathered a large supply; the red berries were soaked in\r\nsalt and water for several days, then washed and rubbed, and finally,\r\nbecoming perfectly white, were dried in the sun. The treatment of the\r\ngreen berries was simple; they were merely exposed to the sun\'s heat for\r\na day or two, and then stored: in this way we obtained enough, both of\r\nblack and white pepper, to last us a very long time.\r\n\r\nI took also a number of young plants, that we might have pepper growing\r\nat Rockburg and our various settlements. Some roots of another plant\r\nwere also taken, which, from the pods, appeared to be a kind of bean.\r\n\r\nWe were glad of this occupation during the tedious business of smoking\r\nthe bears\' meat, and availed ourselves of the leisure time by also\r\npreparing for stuffing the condor and the turkey buzzard, urubu or black\r\nvulture--for I could not determine to which species the smaller bird\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nThe four boys at length became so weary of inaction, that I determined\r\nto let them make an excursion alone on the Savannah. Three of them\r\nreceived this permission with eager delight, but Ernest said he would\r\nprefer to remain with us; to which, as the expedition was to be entirely\r\none of pleasure, I could make no objection.\r\n\r\nLittle Franz, on the other hand, whom I would willingly have kept with\r\nus, was wild to go with his brothers, and I was obliged to consent, as I\r\nhad made the proposal open to all, and could not draw back.\r\n\r\nIn the highest spirits they ran to bring their steeds (as we were fain\r\nto call the cattle they rode) from their pasturage at a short distance.\r\nSpeedily were they saddled, bridled, and mounted--the three lads were\r\nready to be off.\r\n\r\nIt was my wish that our sons should cultivate a habit of bold\r\nindependence, for well I knew that it might be the will of God to\r\ndeprive them easily of their parents; when, without an enterprising\r\nspirit of self-reliance, their position would be truly miserable.\r\n\r\nMy gallant Fritz possessed this desirable quality in no small degree,\r\nand to him I committed the care of his young brothers, charging them to\r\nlook up to and obey him as their leader.\r\n\r\nThey were well armed, well mounted, had a couple of good dogs; and, with\r\na hearty "God speed and bless you, my boys!" I let them depart.\r\n\r\nWe, who remained behind, passed the day in a variety of useful\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nThe bears\' meat, which was being cured in a smoking shed such as that we\r\nset up for the peccary hams, required a good deal of attention from my\r\nwife. Ernest had a fancy for making ornamental cups from the ostrich\r\neggs, while I investigated the interior of the cave.\r\n\r\nI found the inner wall to consist of a kind of talc, mingled with\r\nthreads of asbestos, and also indications of mica. Examining further, I\r\ndetached a large block, and found to my joy that I could split it into\r\nclear transparent sheets, which would serve admirably for window panes.\r\n\r\nMy wife saw this substitute for glass with unfeigned satisfaction,\r\ndeclaring, that although she would not complain, yet the want of glass\r\nfor windows had been a downright trouble to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n The boys return and give an account of their adventures--How they\r\n     captured the antelopes--How Fritz caught the rabbits and Jack rode\r\n     down the gazelles--How they followed the honey bird and Jack tried\r\n     to rob the bees\' byke--We sup on the bears\' paws--Across the\r\n     desert again--Sight three ostriches--The male bird captured--We\r\n     secure him between Storm and Grumble--The mother\'s astonishment at\r\n     our new pet--Return to Woodlands--Home again--We establish\r\n     colonies on Shark and Whale Islands--Turn our attention to\r\n     agriculture--The difficulties of ostrich training--My patent\r\n     saddle and bridle--I exercise my ingenuity in various trades.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs evening approached, the bears\' paws, which were stewing for supper,\r\nsent forth savory odors; and we sat talking round the fire, while\r\nlistening anxiously for sounds heralding the return of our young\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\nAt last the tramp and beat of hoofs struck our ears; the little troop\r\nappeared, crossing the open ground before us at a sharp trot, and a\r\nshrill ringing cheer greeted us as we rose and went to meet them.\r\n\r\nThey sprang from their saddles, the animals were set at liberty to\r\nrefresh themselves, and the riders eagerly came to exhibit their\r\nacquisitions and give an account of themselves.\r\n\r\nFunny figures they cut! Franz and Jack had each a young kid slung on his\r\nback, so that the four legs, tied together, stuck out under their chins.\r\n\r\nFritz\'s game bag looked remarkably queer--round lumps, sharp points, and\r\nan occasional movement seemed to indicate a living creature or creatures\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! for the chase, father!" cried Jack. "Nothing like real hunting\r\nafter all. And just to see how Storm and Grumble go along over a grassy\r\nplain! It is perfectly splendid! We soon tired out the little antelopes,\r\nand were able to catch them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, father," said Franz; "and Fritz has two Angora rabbits in his bag,\r\nand we wanted to bring you some honey. Only think! such a clever bird--a\r\ncuckoo, showed us where it was!"\r\n\r\n"My brothers forget the chief thing," said Fritz. "We have driven a\r\nlittle herd of antelopes right through the Gap into our territory; and\r\nthere they are, all ready for us to hunt when we like--or to catch and\r\ntame!"\r\n\r\n"Well done!" cried I; "here is indeed a list of achievements. But to\r\nyour mother and me, the chief thing of all, is God\'s goodness in\r\nbringing you safe back to us. Now, let us hear the whole story, that we\r\nmay have a definite idea of your performances."\r\n\r\n"We had a splendid ride," said Fritz, "down Glen Verdant, and away to\r\nthe defile through our Rocky Barrier, and the morning was so cool and\r\nfresh that our steeds galloped along, nearly the whole way, at the top\r\nof their speed. When we had passed through the Gap we moderated our\r\nfurious pace and kept our eyes open on the lookout for game; we then\r\ntrotted slowly to the top of a grassy hill, from whose summit we saw two\r\nherds of animals, whether antelopes, goats, or gazelles, we did not\r\nknow, grazing by the side of the stream below us. We were about to\r\ngallop down and try to get a shot at them, when it struck me that it\r\nwould be wiser to try and drive the whole herd through the Gap into our\r\nown domain, where they would be shut up, as it were, in a park, free and\r\nyet within reach. Down the hill we rode as hard as we could go, formed\r\nin a semi-circle behind the larger herd--magnificent antelopes--and,\r\naided by the dogs, with shouts and cries drove them along the stream\r\ntoward the Gap; as we came near the opening they appeared inclined to\r\nhalt and turn, like sheep about to be driven into the butcher\'s yard;\r\nand it was all we could do to prevent them from bolting past us; but, at\r\nlength, one made a rush at the opening and, the rest following, they\r\nwere soon all on the other side of the frontier, and inhabitants of New\r\nSwitzerland."\r\n\r\n"Capital," I said, "capital, my boy! But I don\'t see what is to make\r\nthem remain inhabitants of our domain, or to prevent them from returning\r\nthrough the Gap whenever they feel inclined."\r\n\r\n"Stop, father," he replied, "you interrupt me too soon; we thought of\r\nthat possibility too, and provided against it. We stretched a long line\r\nright across the defile and strung on it feathers and rags and all sorts\r\nof other things, which danced and fluttered in the wind, and looked so\r\nstrange that I am perfectly certain that the herd will never attempt to\r\npass it; in fact, Levaillant, from whom I learned the trick, says, in\r\nhis \'Voyage au Cap de Bonne Esp\xe9rance,\' that the Hottentots make use of\r\nthe method for penning in the antelopes they have caught in the chase."\r\n\r\n"Well done," said I, "I am glad to see that you remember what you have\r\nread. The antelopes are welcome to New Switzerland, but, my boy," I\r\nadded, "I cannot say the same for the rabbits you have there; they\r\nincrease so rapidly that if you establish a colony of the little\r\nwretches your next difficulty will be to get rid of them."\r\n\r\n"True," he replied, "but my idea was to place them upon Whale Island,\r\nwhere they would find abundant food, and at the same time in no way\r\ntrouble us. May I not establish a warren there? It would be so useful.\r\nDo you know, my eagle caught these pretty little fellows for me? I saw a\r\nnumber of them running about and so unhooded him, and in a few minutes\r\nhe brought me three--one dead, with whose body I rewarded him, and these\r\ntwo here, unhurt."\r\n\r\n"Now, father," said Jack, interrupting him, "do listen to me and hear my\r\nstory, or else Fritz will begin upon my adventures and tire you out with\r\nhis rigmarole descriptions."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Jack," I said, "I am quite ready to listen to you. First\r\nand foremostly, how did you bring down those beautiful little animals\r\nyou have there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we galloped them down. The dogs sniffed about in the grass while\r\nFritz was away after the rabbits, out popped those little fawns, and\r\naway they went bounding and skipping at the rate of thirty miles an\r\nhour, with Storm, Grumble, and the dogs at their heels. In about a\r\nquarter of an hour we had left the dogs behind and were close upon our\r\nprey. Down went the little creatures in the grass, and, overcome with\r\nterror and fatigue, were at our mercy. So we shouted to Fritz, and----"\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," said I, "according to your statement, Fritz must have\r\nbeen seven miles and a half off."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, father, perhaps we did not ride for quite a quarter of an\r\nhour, and, of course, I can\'t say exactly how fast we were going; and\r\nthen, you see, the fawns did not run in a straight line; at any rate\r\nFritz heard us, and he and Franz and I leashed the legs of the pretty\r\ncreatures, and then we mounted again, and presently saw a wretch of a\r\ncuckoo, who led us ever so far out of our course by cuckooing and making\r\nfaces at us, and then hopping away. Franz declared it must be an\r\nenchanted princess, and so I thought I would rid it of its spell; but\r\nFritz stopped me shooting it, and said it was a \'Honey Indicator,\' and\r\nthat it was leading us probably to a bees\' byke, so we spared its life,\r\nand presently, sure enough, it stopped close by a bees\' nest in a hollow\r\ntree. This was capital, we thought, and, as we were in a great hurry to\r\ntaste the honey, I threw in a lot of lighted lucifer matches, but\r\nsomehow it did not kill the bees at all, but only made them awfully\r\nangry, and they flew out in a body and stung me all over. I rushed to\r\nStorm and sprang on his back, but, though I galloped away for bare life,\r\nit was an age before I got rid of the little wretches, and now my face\r\nis in a perfect fever. I think I will get mother to bathe it for me;"\r\nand off rushed the noisy boy, leaving Fritz and me to see to the fawns\r\nand examine the rabbits. With these latter I determined to do as Fritz\r\nproposed, namely, to colonize Whale Island with them. I was all the\r\nmore willing to do this because I had been considering the advisability\r\nof establishing on that island a fortress to which we might retreat in\r\nany extreme danger, and where we should be very thankful, in case of\r\nsuch a retreat, to possess means of obtaining a constant supply of\r\nanimal food.\r\n\r\nHaving ministered to the wants of the antelopes, I tried to interest the\r\nboys in my discovery of the block of talc, but just then their mother\r\nsummoned us to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe principal dish in this meal consisted of the bears\' paws--most\r\nsavory smelling delicacies, so tempting that their close resemblance to\r\nhuman hands, and even the roguish "Fee-fo-fum" from Jack, did not\r\nprevent a single member of the family from enjoying them most heartily.\r\n\r\nSupper over, we lit our watch-fire, retired to our tent, and slept\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nWe had been working very diligently; the bears\' meat was smoked, the fat\r\nmelted down and stored, and a large supply of bamboos collected. But I\r\nwished to make yet another excursion, and at early dawn I aroused the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nFritz mounted the mule, I rode Lightfoot, Jack and Franz took their\r\nusual steeds, and, with the two dogs, we galloped off--first to visit\r\nthe euphorbia to collect the gum, and then to discover whether the\r\nostrich had deserted her eggs in the sand.\r\n\r\nErnest watched us depart without the slightest look or sigh of regret,\r\nand returned to the tent to assist his mother and study his books.\r\n\r\nOur steeds carried us down the Green Valley at a rapid rate, and we\r\nfollowed the direction we had pursued on our former expedition. We soon\r\nreached Turtle Marsh, and then, filling our water-flasks, we arrived at\r\nthe rising ground where Fritz discovered the mounted Arabs.\r\n\r\nAs Jack and Franz wanted a gallop, I allowed them to press forward,\r\nwhile Fritz and I visited the euphorbia trees. A quantity of the red gum\r\nhad exuded from the incisions I had made, and as this had coagulated in\r\nthe sun, I rolled it into little balls and stored it in a bamboo jar I\r\nhad brought with me for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs we rode after the boys, who were some way ahead, Fritz remarked:\r\n\r\n"Did you not tell me that the juice of that tree was poisonous, father;\r\nwhy have you collected such a quantity?"\r\n\r\n"I did indeed say so," I replied; "it is a most deadly poison. The\r\ninhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope use it to poison the springs where\r\nwild animals assemble to quench their thirst; and they thus slaughter an\r\nimmense number of the creatures for the sake of their hides. I intend,\r\nhowever, to use it to destroy the apes should they again commit\r\ndepredations, and also in preparing the skins of animals to protect them\r\nfrom the attacks of insects."\r\n\r\nThe two boys were still at some distance from us, when suddenly four\r\nmagnificent ostriches rose from the sand where they had been sitting.\r\n\r\nJack and Franz perceived them, and, with a great shout, drove them\r\ntoward us. In front ran a splendid male bird, his feathers of shining\r\nblack, and his great tail plume waving behind. Three females of an ashen\r\ngray color followed him. They approached us with incredible swiftness,\r\nand were within gunshot before they perceived us. Fritz had had the\r\nforethought to bind up the beak of his eagle so that, should he bring\r\ndown an ostrich, he might be unable to injure it.\r\n\r\nHe now threw up the falcon which, towering upward, swooped down upon the\r\nhead of the foremost bird, and so confused and alarmed him, that he\r\ncould not defend himself nor continue his flight. So greatly was his\r\nspeed checked that Jack overtook him, and hurling his lasso, enfolded\r\nhis wings and legs in its deadly coils and brought him to the ground.\r\nThe other ostriches were almost out of sight, so leaving them to their\r\nown devices, we leaped from our steeds and attempted to approach the\r\ncaptured bird. He struggled fearfully, and kicked with such violence,\r\nright and left, that I almost despaired of getting him home alive.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me, however, that if we could cover his eyes, his fury\r\nmight be subdued. I instantly acted upon this idea, and flung over his\r\nhead my coat and hunting-bag, which effectually shut out the light.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I done this than his struggles ceased, and we were able to\r\napproach. We first secured round his body a broad strip of sealskin, on\r\neach side of which I fastened a stout piece of cord, that I might be\r\nable to lead him easily. Then, fastening another cord in a loop round\r\nhis legs that he might be prevented from breaking into a gallop, we\r\nreleased him from the coils of the lasso.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," said I to the boys, "how the natives of India secure a\r\nnewly captured elephant?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" said Fritz; "they fasten him between two tame elephants.\r\nWe\'ll do that to this fine fellow, and tame him double quick."\r\n\r\n"The only difficulty will be," remarked Jack, "that we have no tame\r\nostriches. However, I daresay Storm and Grumble will have no objection\r\nto perform their part, and it will puzzle even this great monster to run\r\naway with them."\r\n\r\nSo we at once began operations. Storm and Grumble were led up on either\r\nside of the recumbent ostrich, and the cords secured to their girths.\r\nJack and Franz, each armed with a stout whip, mounted their respective\r\nsteeds, the wrappers were removed from the bird\'s eyes, and we stood by\r\nto watch what would next occur.\r\n\r\nFor some moments after the return of his sight he lay perfectly still,\r\nthen he arose with a bound and, not aware of the cords which hampered\r\nhim, attempted to dash forward. The thongs were stout, and he was\r\nbrought to his knees. A fruitless struggle ensued, and then at length,\r\nseeming to accommodate himself to circumstances, he set off at a sharp\r\ntrot, his guards making the air re-echo with their merry shouts. These\r\ncries stimulated the ostrich to yet further exertions, but he was at\r\nlength brought to a stand by the determined refusal of his four-footed\r\ncompanions to continue such a race across loose sand.\r\n\r\nThe boys having enjoyed the long run, I told them to walk with the\r\nprisoner slowly home, while Fritz and I returned to examine the\r\nostrich\'s nest. The eggs were quite warm, and I was certain that the\r\nmother had quite recently left the nest; leaving about half, I packed\r\nthe rest of the eggs in a large bag I had brought for the purpose, and\r\nslung it carefully on the saddle before. We soon caught up our advance\r\nguard, and without other notable incident reached our tent.\r\n\r\nAstonishment and dismay were depicted on the face of the mother as we\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n"My dear husband," she exclaimed, "do you think our provisions so\r\nabundant that you must scour the deserts to find some great beast to\r\nassist us to devour them. You must discover an iron mine next, for iron\r\nis what ostriches chiefly live on, is it not? Oh! I do wish you would be\r\ncontent with the menagerie you have already collected, instead of\r\nbringing in a specimen of every beast you come across. And this is such\r\na useless monster!"\r\n\r\n"Useless! mother," exclaimed Jack; "you would not say so had you seen\r\nhim run; why, he will be the fleetest courser in our stables. I am going\r\nto make a saddle and bridle for him, and in future he shall be my only\r\nsteed. Then as for his appetite, father declares it is most delicate, he\r\nonly wants a little fruit and grass, and a few stones and tenpenny nails\r\nto help his digestion."\r\n\r\nThe way in which Jack assumed the proprietorship of our new prize seemed\r\nto strike his brothers as rather cool, and there was instantly a cry\r\nraised on the subject.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Jack, "let us each take possession of the part of the\r\nostrich we captured. Your bird, Fritz, seized the head, keep that;\r\nfather shall have the body, I\'ll have the legs, and Franz a couple of\r\nfeathers from the tail."\r\n\r\n"Come, come," said I, "I think that Jack has a very good right to the\r\nostrich, seeing that he brought it to the ground, and if he succeeds in\r\ntaming it and converting it into a saddle horse it shall be his. From\r\nthis time, therefore, he is responsible for its training."\r\n\r\nThe day was now too far advanced to allow us to think of setting out for\r\nRockburg, so we fastened up the ostrich between two trees, and devoted\r\nthe remainder of the evening to making preparations for our departure.\r\n\r\nAt early dawn our picturesque caravan was moving homeward. The ostrich\r\ncontinued so refractory that we were obliged to make him again march\r\nbetween Storm and Grumble, and as these gallant steeds were thus\r\nemployed, the cow was harnessed to the cart, laden with our treasures.\r\nRoom was left in the cart for the mother. Jack and Franz mounted Storm\r\nand Grumble, I rode Lightfoot, and Fritz brought up the rear on Swift.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Gap we called a halt, and replaced the cord the boys\r\nhad strung with ostrich feathers by a stout palisade of bamboos. I also\r\ntook the opportunity of collecting a store of pipeclay, as I intended\r\nduring the winter months, which were close at hand, to try my hand at\r\nchina making.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the sugar-cane grove, we again stopped to collect the\r\npeccary hams we had left to be smoked; and my wife begged me to gather\r\nsome seeds of an aromatic plant which grew in the neighborhood, and\r\nwhich had the scent of vanilla. I obtained a good supply, and we moved\r\nforward toward Woodlands, where we intended to rest for the night, after\r\nour long and fatiguing march.\r\n\r\nOur tent was pitched, and on our beds of cotton we slept soundly.\r\n\r\nNext morning early we examined our farmyard, which appeared in a most\r\nprosperous and flourishing condition. The sight of all these domestic\r\nanimals made us long even more than ever for our home at Rockburg, and\r\nwe determined to hasten thither with all possible speed.\r\n\r\nThe number of our pigs, goats, and poultry had greatly increased since\r\nwe had last visited our colony; and some of these, two fine breeds of\r\nchickens especially, my wife wished to take back with her.\r\n\r\nWe found that the herd of antelopes, which Fritz and Jack had driven\r\nthrough the Gap, had taken up their abode in the neighborhood, and\r\nseveral times we saw the beautiful animals browsing among the trees.\r\n\r\nWhile at the farm, we repaired both the animals\' stalls and our dwelling\r\nroom, that the former might be more secure against the attacks of wild\r\nbeasts, and the latter fitted for our accommodation when we should visit\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nEverything at length being satisfactorily arranged, we again retired to\r\nrest, and early next morning completed our journey to Rockburg.\r\n\r\nBy midday we were once more settled at home. Windows and doors were\r\nthrown open to admit fresh air; the animals established in their stalls;\r\nand the cart\'s miscellaneous cargo discharged and arranged.\r\n\r\nAs much time as I could spare, I devoted to the ostrich, whom we\r\nfastened, for the present, between two bamboo posts in front of our\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nI then turned my attention to the eggs we had brought, and which I\r\ndetermined to hatch, if possible, by artificial heat. For this purpose I\r\narranged a stove, which I maintained at a uniform temperature, and on it\r\nI placed the eggs, carefully wrapped in cotton wool.\r\n\r\nNext morning Fritz and I went off in the boat, first to Whale Island,\r\nthere to establish our colonists, the Angora rabbits, and then to Shark\r\nIsland, where we placed the dainty little antelopes. Having made them\r\nhappy with their liberty and abundance of food, we returned as quickly\r\nas possible to cure the bearskins, and add the provisions we had brought\r\nto the stores lying in our cellar.\r\n\r\nAs we returned, we caught up Jack, making his way in great glee toward\r\nRockburg. He was carrying, in a basket, an immense eel, which he and\r\nErnest had secured.\r\n\r\nErnest had set, on the previous night, a couple of lines; one had been\r\ndragged away, but on the other they found this splendid fellow.\r\n\r\nIt proved delicious. Half was prepared for dinner, and the other half\r\nsalted and stowed away.\r\n\r\nWe now, for a short time, again turned our attention to our duties about\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThinking that the veranda would be greatly improved by some creepers, I\r\nsowed, round the foot of each bamboo pillar, vanilla and pepper-seeds,\r\nas well as that of other creeping plants, which would not only give the\r\nhouse a pleasanter aspect, but also afford us shade during the summer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nI constructed a couple of hencoops too, for the hens and their little\r\nchicks which we had brought from Woodlands, for I knew that if I left\r\nthem unprotected, the inquisitive dispositions of Knips and Fangs might\r\ninduce them to make anatomical experiments which would be detrimental to\r\nthe welfare of the youngsters.\r\n\r\nErnest\'s rat skins were voted a nuisance within doors, and were tied\r\ntogether and hung up outside; so powerful was the odor they emitted,\r\nthat even then Jack would pretend to faint every time he passed near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe museum received its addition: the condor and vulture were placed\r\nthere, to be stuffed when we should find time during the rainy season.\r\nThe mica and asbestos, too, were brought in for the present, not to lie\r\nthere idle, but to wait until I could use them as I intended, for china\r\nand lampwicks.\r\n\r\nHaving occupied two days in this way, we turned our attention to other\r\nduties: the cultivation of a wheat, barley, and maize field, the\r\nmanagement of the ostrich\'s eggs, and the taming of the captives.\r\n\r\nAs agriculture was, though the least to our taste, the most important of\r\nthese several duties, we set about it first. The animals drew the plow,\r\nbut the digging and hoeing taxed our powers of endurance to the utmost.\r\n\r\nWe worked two hours in the morning and two in the evening. Fully did we\r\nrealize the words of Scripture: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat\r\nbread."\r\n\r\nIn the interval we devoted our attention to the ostrich. But our efforts\r\non behalf of his education seemed all in vain. He appeared as untameable\r\nas ever. I determined, therefore, to adopt the plan which had subdued\r\nthe refractory eagle.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the tobacco fumes almost alarmed me. The ostrich sank to\r\nthe ground and lay motionless. Slowly, at length, he arose, and paced up\r\nand down between the bamboo posts.\r\n\r\nHe was subdued, but to my dismay resolutely refused all food. I feared\r\nhe would die; for three days he pined, growing weaker and weaker each\r\nday.\r\n\r\n"Food he must have!" said I to my wife; "food he must have!" The mother\r\ndetermined to attempt an experiment. She prepared balls of maize flour,\r\nmixed with butter. One of these she placed within the bird\'s beak. He\r\nswallowed it, and stretched out his long neck, looking inquiringly for a\r\nsecond mouthful. A second, third, and fourth ball followed the first.\r\nHis appetite returned, and his strength came again.\r\n\r\nAll the wild nature of the bird had gone, and I saw with delight that we\r\nmight begin his education as soon as we chose. Rice, guavas, maize, and\r\ncorn he ate readily--_washing it down_, as Jack expressed it, with small\r\npebbles, to the great surprise of Franz, to whom I explained that the\r\nostrich was merely following the instinct common to all birds; that he\r\nrequired these pebbles to digest his food, just as smaller birds require\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nAfter a month of careful training, our captive would trot, gallop, obey\r\nthe sound of our voice, feed from our hand; and, in fact, showed himself\r\nperfectly docile. Now our ingenuity was taxed to the utmost. How were we\r\nto saddle and bridle a bird? First, for a bit for his beak. Vague ideas\r\npassed through my mind, but every one I was obliged to reject. A plan at\r\nlength occurred to me. I recollected the effect of light and its absence\r\nupon the ostrich, how his movements were checked by sudden darkness,\r\nand how, with the light, power returned to his limbs.\r\n\r\nI immediately constructed a leathern hood, to reach from the neck to the\r\nbeak, cutting holes in it for the eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nOver the eyeholes I contrived square flaps or blinkers, which were so\r\narranged with whalebone springs that they closed tightly of themselves.\r\nThe reins were connected with these blinkers, so that the flaps might be\r\nraised or allowed to close at the rider\'s pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen both blinkers were open, the ostrich would gallop straight ahead;\r\nclose his right eye and he turned to the left, close his left and he\r\nturned to the right, shut both and he stood stock still.\r\n\r\nI was justly proud of my contrivance, but, before I could really test\r\nits utility, I was obliged to make a saddle. After several failures, I\r\nsucceeded in manufacturing one to my liking, and in properly securing\r\nit; it was something like an old-fashioned trooper\'s saddle, peaked\r\nbefore and behind--for my great fear was lest the boys should fall. This\r\ncurious-looking contrivance I placed upon the shoulders as near the neck\r\nas possible, and secured it with strong girths round the wings and\r\nacross the breast, to avoid all possibility of the saddle slipping down\r\nthe bird\'s sloping back.\r\n\r\nI soon saw that my plan would succeed, though skill and considerable\r\npractice was necessary in the use of my patent bridle. It was difficult\r\nto remember that to check the courser\'s speed it was necessary to\r\nslacken rein, and that the tighter the reins were drawn, the faster he\r\nwould fly. We at length, however, all learned to manage Master\r\nHurricane, and the distance between Rockburg and Falconhurst was\r\ntraversed in an almost incredibly short space of time. The marvelous\r\nspeed of the bird again revived the dispute as to the ownership, and I\r\nwas obliged to interfere.\r\n\r\n"Jack shall retain the ostrich," said I, "for it is most suited to him;\r\nhe is a lighter weight than either of you his elder brothers, and Franz\r\nis not yet strong enough to manage such a fleet courser. But he is so\r\nfar to be considered common property, that all may practice on him\r\noccasionally; and, in a case of necessity, any one may mount him."\r\n\r\nOur field work was by this time over. The land had been plowed and sown\r\nwith wheat, barley, and maize. On the other side of Jackal River we had\r\nplanted potatoes and cassava roots, and all sorts of other seeds had\r\nbeen carefully sown.\r\n\r\nWe had not neglected the ostrich\'s eggs, and one day Fritz introduced me\r\nwith great glee to three little ostriches. But alas, the little\r\ncreatures were not destined to enjoy life long. One died almost as soon\r\nas it was hatched, and the others, after tottering about on their\r\nstilt-like legs for a few days, followed its example.\r\n\r\nI now found time to turn my attention to the bears\' skins, which\r\nrequired preparation before they would be fit for use as leather. They\r\nhad been salted and dried, and now required tanning. I had no tan,\r\nhowever. This was unfortunate; but not to be deterred from my purpose, I\r\ndetermined to use a mixture of honey and water in its place.\r\n\r\nThe experiment proved successful. When the skins were dried they\r\nremained flexible and free from smell, while the fur was soft and\r\nglossy.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only result of the experiment, for the honey-water\r\nwhich I boiled appeared so clear and tempting, that it struck me that I\r\nmight prepare from it an excellent drink. I put by some of the liquid\r\nbefore making use of it as tan, and reboiled it with nutmeg and\r\ncinnamon. The preparation, which much resembled English mead, was\r\npronounced delicious, and the mother begged me to brew a large supply.\r\nAs our cellar was now well stocked with provisions for the winter, and\r\nour other preparations were completed, I was able to turn my attention\r\nto details of lesser importance. The boys had been clamoring for hats,\r\nand as my success in so many trades had surprised me, I agreed to turn\r\nhatter for the nonse. With the rat skins and a solution of india rubber,\r\nI produced a kind of felt, which I dyed a brilliant red with cochineal,\r\nand stretching this on a wooden block I had prepared, I passed over it a\r\nhot iron, to smooth the nap, and by next morning had the satisfaction of\r\npresenting to my wife a neat little red Swiss cap, to be lined and\r\nfinished by her for one of the boys. The mother admired the production\r\nimmensely, and lining it with silk, added yet more to its gay appearance\r\nby adorning it with ribbons and ostrich feathers, and finally placed it\r\nupon the head of little Franz.\r\n\r\nSo delighted was every one with the hat, that all were eager to be\r\nsimilarly provided, and begged me to manufacture more. I readily agreed\r\nto do so, as soon as they should furnish me with the necessary\r\nmaterials, and advised them to make half a dozen rat traps, that they\r\nmight secure the water rats with which the stream abounded, and whose\r\nrich glossy fur would serve admirably for felt.\r\n\r\nEvery fifth animal that they brought me I told them should be mine, that\r\nI might obtain material for a hat for myself and their mother.\r\n\r\nThe boys at once agreed to this arrangement, and began the manufacture\r\nof the traps, which were all so made that they should kill the rats at\r\nonce, for I could not bear the idea of animals being tortured or\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus engaged I applied myself to the manufacture of\r\nporcelain. I first cleaned the pipeclay and talc from all foreign\r\nsubstances, and made them ready to be beaten down with water into a soft\r\nmass, and then prepared my molds of gypsum plaster. These preparations\r\nwere at length made, and the molds received a thin layer of the\r\nporcelain material. When this was partly baked, I sprinkled over it a\r\npowder of colored glass beads which I had crushed, and which looked very\r\npretty in patterns upon the transparent porcelain.\r\n\r\nSome of my china vessels cracked with the heat of the stove, some were\r\nvery ill-shaped; but, after many failures, I succeeded in producing a\r\nset of white cups and saucers, a cream-jug, a sugar-basin, and half a\r\ndozen small plates.\r\n\r\nI must allow that my china was far from perfect; the shape of some of\r\nthe vessels was faulty, and none were really transparent; nevertheless,\r\nthe general appearance gave great satisfaction, and when the plates were\r\nfilled with rosy and golden fruit resting on green leaves, and fragrant\r\ntea filled the cups, it greatly added to the appearance of the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n The rainy season again--The building of the cajack--The mother invents\r\n     a swimming dress--A visit to our colonies--Mysterious seaweed--The\r\n     mother\'s surprise--A visit to Whale Island--Mischievous pigs--The\r\n     three boys return from a day\'s hunting--They display their\r\n     treasures--A new skinning apparatus--We make a crushing\r\n     machine--An early harvest--We prepare a threshing floor--Reaping\r\n     in Italian fashion--Threshing also in Italian fashion--Return of\r\n     the herring shoals.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had I completed my pottery, when great black clouds and\r\nterrific storms heralded the approach of another winter. The rainy\r\nseason having set in, we were compelled to give up our daily excursions.\r\n\r\nEven in the spacious house which we now occupied, and with our varied\r\nand interesting employments, we yet found the time dragging heavily. The\r\nspirits of all were depressed, and even occasional rapid rides, during a\r\npartial cessation of the rain, failed permanently to arouse them. Fritz,\r\nas well as I, had perceived this, and he said to me:\r\n\r\n"Why, father, should we not make a canoe, something swifter and more\r\nmanageable than those vessels we as yet possess? I often long for a\r\nlight skiff, in which I might skim over the surface of the water."\r\n\r\nThe idea delighted all hands, but the mother, who was never happy when\r\nwe were on the sea, declared that our chances of drowning were, with the\r\npinnace and canoe, already sufficiently great, and that there was not\r\nthe slightest necessity for our adding to these chances by constructing\r\nanother craft which would tempt us out upon the perfidious element. My\r\nwife\'s fears were, however, speedily allayed, for I assured her that the\r\nboat I intended to construct should be no flimsy cockle-shell, but as\r\nsafe and stout a craft as ever floated upon the sea. The Greenlander\'s\r\ncajack I intended to be my model, and I resolved not only to occupy the\r\nchildren, but also to produce a strong and serviceable canoe--a\r\nmasterpiece of art.\r\n\r\nThe boys were interested, and the boat-building was soon in operation.\r\nWe constructed the skeleton of whalebone, using split bamboo canes to\r\nstrengthen the sides and also to form the deck, which extended the whole\r\nlength of the boat, leaving merely a square hole in which the occupant\r\nof the canoe might sit.\r\n\r\nThe work engrossed our attention most entirely, and by the time it was\r\ncomplete the rain had passed away and the glorious sun again shone\r\nbrightly forth.\r\n\r\nOur front door was just wide enough to admit of the egress of our boat,\r\nand we completed her construction in the open air. We quickly cased the\r\nsides and deck with sealskin, making all the seams thoroughly watertight\r\nwith caoutchouc.\r\n\r\nThe cajack was indeed a curious looking craft, yet so light that she\r\nmight be lifted easily with one hand, and when at length we launched her\r\nshe bounded upon the water like an India rubber ball. Fritz was\r\nunanimously voted her rightful owner, but before his mother would hear\r\nof his entering the frail-looking skiff she declared that she must\r\ncontrive a swimming dress, that "should his boat receive a puncture from\r\na sharp rock or the dorsal of a fish and collapse, he might yet have a\r\nchance of saving his life."\r\n\r\nThough I did not consider the cajack quite the soap bubble the mother\r\nimagined it, I yet willingly agreed to assist her in the construction of\r\nthe dress.\r\n\r\nThe garment we produced was most curious in appearance, and I must own\r\nthat I doubted its efficiency. It was like a double waistcoat, made of\r\nlinen prepared with a solution of india rubber, the seams being likewise\r\ncoated with caoutchouc, and the whole rendered perfectly air-tight. We\r\nso arranged it that one little hole was left, by means of which air\r\ncould be forced into the space between the outer covering and the\r\nlining, and the dress inflated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I perceived with pleasure the rapid vegetation the climate was\r\nproducing. The seeds we had scattered had germinated, and were now\r\npromising magnificent crops. The veranda, too, was looking pleasant with\r\nits gay and sweet-scented creepers, which were already aspiring to the\r\nsummit of the pillars. The air was full of birds, the earth seemed\r\nteeming with life.\r\n\r\nThe dress was at length completed, and Fritz one fine afternoon offered\r\npublicly to prove it. We all assembled on the beach, the boy gravely\r\ndonned and inflated the garment, and, amid roars of laughter from his\r\nbrothers, entered the water. Quickly and easily he paddled himself\r\nacross the bay toward Shark Island, whither we followed in one of our\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was most successful, and Ernest, Jack, and Franz, in\r\nspite of their laughter at their brother\'s garment, begged their mother\r\nto make for each of them a similar dress.\r\n\r\nWhile on the island we paid a visit to the colonists whom we had\r\nestablished there the previous autumn. All was well; we could perceive\r\nby the footprints that the antelopes had discovered and made use of the\r\nshelter we had erected for them, and feeling that we could do nothing\r\nmore we scattered handfuls of maize and salt, and strolled across to the\r\nother side of the island. The shore was covered with lovely shells, many\r\nof which, with beautiful pieces of delicate coral, the boys collected\r\nfor their museum; strewn by the edge of the water too lay a great\r\nquantity of seaweed of various colors, and as the mother declared that\r\nmuch of it was of use, the boys assisted her to collect it and store it\r\nin the boat. As we pulled back to the land I was surprised to see that\r\nmy wife chose from among the seaweed a number of curious leaves with\r\nedges notched like a saw. When we reached home she carefully washed\r\nthese and dried them in the oven. There was evidently something\r\nmysterious about this preparation, and my curiosity at length prompted\r\nme to make an attempt to discover the secret.\r\n\r\n"Are these leaves to form a substitute for tobacco?" said I; "do you so\r\nlong for its refreshing smell?"\r\n\r\nMy wife smiled, for her dislike to tobacco was well known, and she\r\nanswered in the same jocular tone:\r\n\r\n"Do you not think that a mattress stuffed with these leaves would be\r\nvery cool in summer?"\r\n\r\nThe twinkle in her eyes showed me that my curiosity must still remain\r\nunsatisfied, but it nevertheless became greater than ever.\r\n\r\nThe boys and I had one day made a long and fatiguing expedition, and,\r\ntired out, we flung ourselves down in the veranda. As we lay there\r\nresting, we heard the mother\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Could any of you enjoy a little jelly?"\r\n\r\nShe presently appeared, bearing a porcelain dish laden with most lovely\r\ntransparent jelly. Cut with a spoon and laid before us it quivered and\r\nglittered in the light.\r\n\r\n"Ambrosia!" exclaimed Fritz, tasting it. It was indeed delicious, and,\r\nstill marveling from whence the mother could have obtained a dish so\r\nrare, we disposed of all that she had set before us.\r\n\r\n"Aha," laughed the mother, "is not this an excellent substitute for\r\ntobacco, far more refreshing than the nasty weed itself. Behold the\r\nproduct of my mysterious seaweed."\r\n\r\n"My dear wife," exclaimed I, "this dish is indeed a masterpiece of\r\nculinary art, but where had you met with it? What put it into your\r\nhead?"\r\n\r\n"While staying with my Dutch friends at the Cape," replied she, "I often\r\nsaw it, and at once recognized the leaves on Shark Island. Once knowing\r\nthe secret, the preparation of the dish is extremely simple; the leaves\r\nare soaked in water, fresh every day, for a week, and then boiled for a\r\nfew hours with orange juice, citron, and sugar."\r\n\r\nWe were all delighted with the delicacy, and thanked the mother for it\r\nmost heartily, the boys declaring that they must at once go off again to\r\nthe island to collect as many of the leaves as they could find. I agreed\r\nto accompany them, for I wished to examine the plantations we had made\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAll were flourishing, the palms and mangroves had shot up in a most\r\nmarvelous manner, and many of the seeds which I had cast at random among\r\nthe cliffs in the rocks had germinated, and promised to clothe the\r\nnakedness of the frowning boulders.\r\n\r\nAway up among the rocks, too, we discovered a bright sparkling spring of\r\ndelicious water, at which, from the footprints around, we saw that the\r\nantelopes must have refreshed themselves.\r\n\r\nFinding everything so satisfactory, we were naturally anxious to\r\ndiscover how our colony and plantations on Whale Island had fared. It\r\nwas evident at a glance that the rabbits had increased; the young and\r\ntender shoots of the trees bore the marks of many greedy, mischievous\r\nlittle teeth. The cocoanut palms alone had they spared.\r\n\r\nSuch depredations as these could not be allowed, and with the help of\r\nthe boys I erected round each stem a hedge of prickly thorn, and then\r\nprepared again to embark; before we did so, however, I noticed that some\r\nof the seaweed had also been gnawed by the rabbits, and wondering what\r\nit could have been to tempt them, I collected some of it to examine more\r\nfully at home.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the whale, too, attracted our attention, for, picked\r\nclean by the birds and bleached by the sun and rain, the bones had been\r\npurified to a most perfect whiteness. Thinking that the joints of the\r\nvertebr\xe6 might be made of use, I separated some ten or twelve, and\r\nrolled them down to the boat, and then returned to the shore, towing\r\nthem after us.\r\n\r\nA scheme now occupied my mind for the construction of a crushing\r\nmachine, which would prove of the greatest service to us. I knew that to\r\nmake such a machine of stone was far beyond my power, but it had struck\r\nme that the vertebr\xe6 of the whale might serve my purpose.\r\n\r\nI determined next morning to look out a tree from which I might cut the\r\nblocks of wood that I should require to raise my crushers.\r\n\r\nMy expedition was destined to be a solitary one, for when I went to the\r\nstables for a horse, I discovered that the boys had gone off by\r\nthemselves with their guns and traps, and had left to me a choice\r\nbetween the bull and buffalo.\r\n\r\nWith Storm, therefore, I was fain to be content. I crossed the bridge,\r\nbut as I reached the cassava field I noticed to my great annoyance that\r\nit had been overrun and laid waste by some mischievous animals. I\r\nexamined the footprints, and seeing that they greatly resembled those of\r\npigs, determined to follow the trail, and see who these invaders of our\r\nterritory would prove to be. The track led me on for some way until I\r\nalmost lost sight of it near our old potato field. For some time I\r\nhunted backward and forward without seeing a sign of the animals; at\r\nlength a loud barking from Floss and Bruno, who were with me, announced\r\nthat they had been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe whole family of our old sow, and she herself, were standing at bay,\r\nshowing their teeth and grunting so savagely, that the dogs feared to\r\napproach them.\r\n\r\nI raised my gun and fired twice among the herd; two of the pigs fell,\r\nand the rest fled, followed by the dogs. I picked up the pigs, and\r\ncalling back the pursuers, continued my way through the forest.\r\n\r\nA tree suited to my purpose was soon found; I marked it and returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nErnest, who had remained at home, assisted me to flay the young porkers,\r\nand I handed them over to the mother to prepare for supper; by which\r\ntime I hoped the other lads would have returned.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening we heard the sounds of trampling hoofs, and\r\npresently Jack appeared, thundering along upon his two-legged steed,\r\nfollowed in the distance by Fritz and Franz. These latter carried upon\r\ntheir cruppers game bags, the contents of which were speedily displayed;\r\nfour birds, a kangaroo, twenty muskrats, a monkey, two hares, and half a\r\ndozen beaver rats, were laid before me. Besides these, Fritz threw down,\r\nwithout a word of explanation, a bundle of thistles.\r\n\r\nThe boys seemed almost wild with excitement at the success of their\r\nexpedition, and presently Jack exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, you can\'t think what grand fun hunting on an ostrich is; we\r\nflew along like the wind; sometimes I could scarcely breathe, we were\r\ngoing at such a rate, and was obliged to shut my eyes because of the\r\nterrific rush of air; really, father, you must make me a mask with glass\r\neyes to ride with, or I shall be blinded one of these fine days."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" replied I, "I must do no such thing."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked he, with a look of amazement upon his face.\r\n\r\n"For two reasons; firstly, because I do not consider that I _must_ do\r\nanything that you demand; and, secondly, because I think that you are\r\nvery capable of doing it yourself. However, I must congratulate you upon\r\nyour abundant supply of game; you must have indeed worked hard. Yet I\r\nwish that you would let me know when you intend starting on such a long\r\nexpedition as this; you forget that though you yourselves know that you\r\nare quite safe, and that all is going on well, yet that we at home are\r\nkept in a constant state of anxiety. Now, off with you, and look to your\r\nanimals, and then you may find supper ready."\r\n\r\nPresently the boys returned, and we prepared for a most appetizing meal\r\nwhich the mother set before us.\r\n\r\nWhile we were discussing the roast pig, and washing it down with\r\nfragrant mead, Fritz described the day\'s expedition.\r\n\r\nThey had set their traps near Woodlands, and had there captured the\r\nmuskrats, attracting them with small carrots, while with other traps,\r\nbaited with fish and earth-worms, they had caught several beaver rats,\r\nand a duck-billed platypus. Hunting and fishing had occupied the rest of\r\nthe day, and it was with immense pride that Jack displayed the kangaroo\r\nwhich he had run down with his swift courser. Contributions to the\r\ngarden had not been forgotten, and Fritz handed over to his mother\r\nseveral cuttings from cinnamon and sweet-apple trees. Finally, when all\r\nthe other treasures had been displayed, Fritz begged me to examine his\r\nthistles which he had gathered, thinking, he said, that it was a plant\r\nused in the manufacture of wool. He was perfectly right, for I\r\nrecognized it at once as the "fuller\'s teazle," a plant whose sharp\r\nlittle thorns, which cover the stem and leaves, are used to raise the\r\nnap of cloth.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to be up betimes the following morning, that we might attend\r\nto the preparation of the booty, and as I now noticed that the boys were\r\nall becoming extremely drowsy, I closed the day with evening devotions.\r\n\r\nThe number of the creatures we killed rendered the removal of their\r\nskins a matter of no little time and trouble. It was not an agreeable\r\ntask at any time, and when I saw the array of animals the boys had\r\nbrought me to flay, I determined to construct a machine which would\r\nconsiderably lessen the labor. Among the ship\'s stores, in the surgeon\'s\r\nchest, I discovered a large syringe. This, with a few alterations, would\r\nserve my purpose admirably. Within the tube I first fitted a couple of\r\nvalves, and then, perforating the stopper, I had in my possession a\r\npowerful air pump.\r\n\r\nThe boys stared at me in blank amazement when, armed with this\r\ninstrument, I took up the kangaroo, and declared myself ready to\r\ncommence operations.\r\n\r\n"Skin a kangaroo with a squirt?" said they, and a roar of laughter\r\nfollowed the remark.\r\n\r\nI made no reply to the jests which followed, but silently hung the\r\nkangaroo by its hind legs to the branch of a tree. I then made a small\r\nincision in the skin, and inserting the mouth of the syringe forced air\r\nwith all my might between the skin and the body of the animal. By\r\ndegrees the hide of the kangaroo distended, altering the shape of the\r\ncreature entirely.\r\n\r\nStill I worked on, forcing in yet more air until it had become a mere\r\nshapeless mass, and I soon found that the skin was almost entirely\r\nseparated from the carcass. A bold cut down the belly, and a few touches\r\nhere and there where the ligatures still bound the hide to the body, and\r\nthe animal was flayed.\r\n\r\n"What a splendid plan!" cried the boys; "but why should it do it?"\r\n\r\n"For a most simple and natural reason," I replied; "do you not know that\r\nthe skin of an animal is attached to its flesh merely by slender and\r\ndelicate fibers, and that between these exist thousands of little\r\nbladders or air chambers; by forcing air into these bladders the fibers\r\nare stretched, and at length, elastic as they are, cracked. The skin has\r\nnow nothing to unite it to the body, and, consequently, may be drawn off\r\nwith perfect ease. This scientific fact has been known for many years;\r\nthe Greenlanders make constant use of it; when they have killed a seal\r\nor walrus, they distend the skin that they may tow the animal more\r\neasily ashore, and then remove its hide at a moment\'s notice."\r\n\r\nThe remaining animals were subjected to the same treatment, and, to my\r\ngreat joy, in a couple of days the skins were all off, and being\r\nprepared for use.\r\n\r\nI now summoned the boys to assist me in procuring blocks of wood for my\r\ncrushing machine, and the following day we set forth with saws, ropes,\r\naxes, and other tools. We soon reached the tree I had selected for my\r\npurpose, and I began by sending Fritz and Jack up into the tree with\r\naxes to cut off the larger of the high branches that, when the tree\r\nfell, it might not injure its neighbors. They then descended, and Fritz\r\nand I attacked the stem. As the easiest and most speedy method we used\r\na saw, such a one as is employed by sawyers in a saw-pit, and Fritz\r\ntaking one end and I the other, the tree was soon cut half through. We\r\nthen adjusted ropes that we might guide its fall, and again began to\r\ncut. It was laborious work, but when I considered that the cut was\r\nsufficiently deep we took the ropes and pulled with our united strength.\r\nThe trunk cracked, swayed, tottered, and fell with a crash.\r\n\r\nThe boughs were speedily lopped off, and the trunk sawed into blocks\r\nfour feet long.\r\n\r\nTo cut down and divide this tree had taken us a couple of days, and on\r\nthe third we carted home four large and two small blocks, and with the\r\nvertebr\xe6 joints of the whale I, in a very short time, completed my\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged on this undertaking I had paid little attention to our\r\nfields of grain, and, accordingly, great was my surprise when one\r\nevening the fowls returned, showing most evident indifference to their\r\nevening meal, and with their crops perfectly full. It suddenly struck me\r\nthat these birds had come from the direction of our cornfield. I hurried\r\noff to see what damage they had done, and then found to my great joy\r\nthat the grain was perfectly ripe.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work before us startled my wife. This unexpected harvest,\r\nwhich added reaping and threshing to the fishing, salting, and pickling\r\nalready on hand, quite troubled her.\r\n\r\n"Only think," said she, "of my beloved potatoes and manioc roots! What\r\nis to become of them, I should like to know? It is time to take them up,\r\nand how to manage it, with all this press of work, I can\'t see."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be down-hearted, wife," said I; "there is no immediate hurry\r\nabout the manioc, and digging potatoes in this fine, light soil is easy\r\nwork compared to what it is in Switzerland, while as to planting more,\r\nthat will not be necessary if we leave the younger plants in the ground.\r\nThe harvest we must conduct after the Italian fashion, which, although\r\nanything but economical, will save time and trouble, and as we are to\r\nhave two crops in the year, we need not be too particular."\r\n\r\nWithout further delay, I commenced leveling a large space of firm,\r\nclayey ground to act as a threshing floor; it was well sprinkled with\r\nwater, rolled, beaten, and stamped; as the sun dried the moisture it was\r\nwatered anew, and the treatment continued until it became as flat, hard,\r\nand smooth as threshing floor need be.\r\n\r\nOur largest wicker basket was then slung between Storm and Grumble; we\r\narmed ourselves with reaping hooks, and went forth to gather in the corn\r\nin the simplest and most expeditious manner imaginable.\r\n\r\nI told my reapers not to concern themselves about the length of the\r\nstraw, but to grasp the corn where it was convenient to them, without\r\nstooping; each was to wind a stalk around his own handful, and throw it\r\ninto the basket; in this way great labor was saved. The plan pleased the\r\nboys immensely, and in a short time the basket had been filled many\r\ntimes, and the field displayed a quantity of tall, headless stubble,\r\nwhich perfectly horrified the mother, so extravagant and untidy did she\r\nconsider our work.\r\n\r\n"This is dreadful!" cried she; "you have left numbers of ears growing on\r\nshort stalks, and look at that splendid straw completely wasted! I don\'t\r\napprove of your Italian fashion at all."\r\n\r\n"It is not a bad plan, I can assure you, wife, and the Italians do not\r\nwaste the straw by not cutting it with the grain; having more arable\r\nthan pasture land, they use this high stubble for their cattle, letting\r\nthem feed in it, and eat what grain is left; afterward, allowing the\r\ngrass to grow up among it, they mow all together for winter fodder. And\r\nnow for threshing, also in Italian fashion. We shall find it spare our\r\narms and backs as much in that as in reaping."\r\n\r\nThe little sheaves were laid in a large circle on the floor, the boys\r\nmounted Storm, Grumble, Lightfoot, and Hurry, starting off at a brisk\r\ntrot, with many a merry jest, and round they went, trampling and\r\nstamping out the grain, while dust and chaff flew in clouds about them.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I were incessantly occupied with hay-forks, by means of\r\nwhich we shook up and moved the sheaves over which the threshers rode,\r\nso as to throw them in the track.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the animals took mouthfuls of the tempting food they\r\nwere beating out; we thought they well deserved it, and called to mind\r\nthe command given to the Jews, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\r\ntreadeth out the corn."\r\n\r\nAfter threshing, we proceeded to winnowing; by simply throwing the\r\nthreshed corn with shovels high in the air when the land or sea-breeze\r\nblew strong, the chaff and refuse was carried away by the wind and the\r\ngrain fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring these operations our poultry paid the threshing-floor many\r\nvisits, testifying a lively interest in the success of our labors, and\r\ngobbling up the grain at such a rate that my wife was obliged to keep\r\nthem at a reasonable distance; but I would not have them altogether\r\nstinted in the midst of our plenty. I said, "Let them enjoy themselves;\r\nwhat we lose in grain, we gain in flesh. I anticipate delicious\r\nchicken-pie, roast goose, and boiled turkey!"\r\n\r\nWhen our harvest stores were housed, we found that we had reaped sixty,\r\neighty, even a hundred fold what had been sown. Our garner was truly\r\nfilled with all manner of store.\r\n\r\nExpecting a second harvest, we were constrained to prepare the field for\r\nsowing again, and immediately therefore commenced mowing down the\r\nstubble. While engaged in this, flocks of quails and partridges came to\r\nglean among the scattered ears. We did not secure any great number, but\r\nresolved to be prepared for them next season, and by spreading nets, to\r\ncatch them in large quantities.\r\n\r\nMy wife was satisfied when she saw the straw carried home and stacked;\r\nour crop of maize, which of course had not been threshed like the other\r\ncorn, afforded soft leaves which were used for stuffing mattresses,\r\nwhile the stalks, when burnt, left ashes so rich in alkali as to be\r\nespecially useful.\r\n\r\nI changed the crops sown on the ground to rye, barley, and oats, and\r\nhoped they would ripen before the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe shoals of herring made their appearance just as we finished our\r\nagricultural operations. This year we pickled only two barrels of them;\r\nbut we were not so merciful toward the seals, which arrived on the coast\r\ndirectly afterward. We hunted them vigorously, requiring their skins for\r\nmany purposes, more especially for the completion of the cajack. On the\r\nlittle deck of that tiny vessel I had made a kind of magazine, in which\r\nto store pistols, ammunition, water, and provisions, and this I meant to\r\ncover with sealskin, so as to be quite watertight. A couple of harpoons\r\nfurnished with seal bladders were to be suspended alongside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n Trial of the cajack--Fritz kills a walrus--We carry home its head--The\r\n     storm--Where is Fritz?--Safe at last--The fishing season--An\r\n     expedition proposed--Three of the boys start for Woodlands--Pigeon\r\n     post--Encounter with a hyena--Wood Lake explored--A\r\n     tapir--Prospect Hill pillaged--A tragedy--The boys in danger--We\r\n     join them--We build a summer house--Discover the cacao\r\n     plant--Fritz ascends the stream--He sees elephants and\r\n     hippopotami--Jack\'s "moist secret"--We return to Rockburg--Grace\r\n     and beauty--Shark Island is fortified.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last came the day when Fritz was to make his trial trip with the\r\ncajack. Completely equipped in swimming costume--trousers, jacket, and\r\ncap--it was most ludicrous to see him cower down in the canoe and puff\r\nand blow till he began to swell like the frog in the fable.\r\n\r\nAll trace of his original figure was speedily lost, and shouts of\r\nlaughter greeted his comical appearance. Even his mother could not\r\nresist a smile, although the dress was her invention.\r\n\r\nI got the other boat out, that my wife might see we were ready to go to\r\nhis assistance the moment it became necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cajack was launched from a convenient shelving point, and floated\r\nlightly on the sea-green ocean mirror. Fritz with his paddles then began\r\nto practice all manner of evolutions: darting along with arrowy\r\nswiftness, wheeling to the right, then to the left; and at last,\r\nflinging himself quite on his side, while his mother uttered a shriek of\r\nterror, he showed that the tiny craft would neither capsize nor sink.\r\nThen, recovering his balance, he sped securely on his further way.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by our shouts of approbation, he now boldly ventured into\r\nthe strong current of Jackal River, and was rapidly carried out to sea.\r\n\r\nThis being more than I had bargained for, I lost no time in giving chase\r\nin the boat, with Ernest and Jack; my wife urging us to greater speed,\r\nand declaring that some accident could not fail to happen to "that\r\nhorrid soap-bubble."\r\n\r\nWe soon arrived outside the bay, at the rocks where formerly lay the\r\nwreck, and gazed in all directions for signs of the runaway.\r\n\r\nAfter a time we saw, at a considerable distance, a faint puff of smoke,\r\nfollowed by the crack of a pistol. Upon this we fired a signal shot,\r\nwhich was presently answered by another, and, steering in the direction\r\nof the sound, we soon heard the boy\'s cheery halloo; the cajack darted\r\nfrom behind a point of land, and we quickly joined company.\r\n\r\n"Come to this rocky beach," cried Fritz, "I have something to show you."\r\n\r\nWith blank amazement we beheld a fine, well-grown young walrus,\r\nharpooned and quite dead.\r\n\r\n"Did you kill this creature, my dear Fritz?" I exclaimed, looking round\r\nin some anxiety, and half expecting to see a naked savage come to claim\r\nthe prize.\r\n\r\n"To be sure, father! don\'t you see my harpoon? Why do you doubt it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I scarcely know," replied I, laughing; "but success so speedy, so\r\nunexpected, and so appropriate, to an amateur Greenlander, took me by\r\nsurprise. I congratulate you, my boy! But I must tell you that you have\r\nalarmed us by making this long trip. You should not have gone out of the\r\nbay. I left your mother in grievous trouble."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, father, I had no idea of passing out of sight, but once in the\r\ncurrent, I was carried along, and could not help myself. Then I came on\r\na herd of walruses, and I did so long to make a prize of one that I\r\nforgot everything else, and made chase after them when beyond the\r\ninfluence of the current, until I got near enough to harpoon this fine\r\nfellow. He swam more slowly, and I struck him a second time; then he\r\nsought refuge among these rocks, and expired. I landed, and scrambled to\r\nwhere he lay, but I took care to give him the contents of my pistol\r\nbefore going close up, having a salutary recollection of the big\r\nserpent\'s parting fling at you, Jack."\r\n\r\n"You ran a very great risk," said I. "The walrus is an inoffensive\r\ncreature; but when attacked and wounded, it often becomes furious, and,\r\nturning upon its pursuer, can destroy, with its long tusks, a strongly\r\nbuilt whale boat. However, thank God for your safety! I value that above\r\na thousand such creatures. Now, what\'s to be done with him? He must be\r\nquite fourteen feet long, although not full grown."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad you followed me, father," said Fritz; "but our united\r\nstrength will not remove this prodigious weight from among these rocks;\r\nonly do let me carry away the head, with these grand, snow-white tusks!\r\nI should so like to fasten it on the prow of the cajack, and name it the\r\n_Sea-horse_."\r\n\r\n"We must certainly carry away the beautiful ivory tusks," said I; "but\r\nmake haste; the air feels so excessively close and sultry, I think a\r\nstorm is brewing."\r\n\r\n"But the head! the head! we must have the whole head," cried Jack; "just\r\nthink how splendid it will look on the cajack!"\r\n\r\n"And how splendid it will smell too, when it begins to putrify," added\r\nErnest; "what a treat for the steersman?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we will prepare for that," said Fritz; "it shall be soaked and\r\ncleaned, and dried until it is as hard as a wooden model; it shall not\r\noffend your delicate nose in the least, Ernest!"\r\n\r\n"I supposed the walrus to be an animal peculiar to the Arctic regions,"\r\nremarked Ernest.\r\n\r\n"And so it is," I replied; "though they may occasionally be seen\r\nelsewhere; these may have wandered from the Antarctic seas. I know that\r\non the eastern coast of Africa is found a smaller species of walrus\r\ncalled the dugong; it has long incisor teeth, but not tusks; and\r\ncertainly resembles a seal, rather than a walrus."\r\n\r\nWhile thus speaking, we were actively engaged in the decapitation of the\r\nwalrus, and in cutting off long strips of its skin. This took some time,\r\nas we had not the proper implements, and Fritz remarked that in future\r\nthe cajack must be provided with a hunting-knife and a hatchet; adding\r\nthat he should like to have a small compass in a box, with a glass top,\r\nfixed in front of the hole where the steersman sits. I saw the necessity\r\nof this, and I promised it should be done.\r\n\r\nOur work being accomplished, we were ready to go, and I proposed to take\r\nFritz and the canoe on board our boat, so that we might all arrive\r\ntogether; but I yielded to his earnest wish to return alone as he came;\r\nhe longed to act as our avant-courier, and announce our approach to his\r\nmother; so he was soon skimming away over the surface of the water,\r\nwhile we followed at a slower rate.\r\n\r\nBlack clouds meanwhile gathered thick and fast around us, and a\r\ntremendous storm came on. Fritz was out of sight, and beyond our reach.\r\n\r\nWe buckled on the swimming belts and firmly lashed ourselves to the\r\nboat, so that we might not be washed overboard by the towering seas\r\nwhich broke over it.\r\n\r\nThe horizon was shrouded in darkness, fearful gusts of wind lashed the\r\nocean into foam, rain descended in torrents, while livid lightning\r\nglared athwart the gloom. Both my boys faced the danger nobly; and my\r\nfeelings of alarm were mingled with hope on finding how well the boat\r\nbehaved.\r\n\r\nThe tempest swept on its way, and the sky began to clear as suddenly as\r\nit had been overcast; yet the stormy waves continued for a long time to\r\nthreaten our frail bark with destruction, in spite of its buoyancy and\r\nsteadiness.\r\n\r\nYet I never lost hope for ourselves--all my fears were for Fritz; in\r\nfact I gave him up for lost, and my whole agonized heart arose in\r\nprayer for strength to say, "Thy will be done!"\r\n\r\nAt last we rounded the point, and once more entering Safety Bay, quickly\r\ndrew near the little harbor.\r\n\r\nWhat was our surprise--our overwhelming delight--when there we saw the\r\nmother with Fritz, as well as her little boy, on their knees in prayer\r\nso earnest for our deliverance, that our approach was unperceived, until\r\nwith cries of joy we attracted their notice. Then indeed ensued a happy\r\nmeeting, and we gave thanks together for the mercy which had spared our\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nReturning joyfully to Rockburg, we changed our drenched garments for\r\nwarm, dry clothes; and, seated at a comfortable meal, considered and\r\ndescribed at our ease the perils of the storm.\r\n\r\nAfterward, the head of the walrus was conveyed to our workshop; where it\r\nunderwent such a skillful and thorough process of cleaning, embalming,\r\nand drying, that ere long it was actually fixed on the prow of the\r\ncajack, and a most imposing appearance it presented!\r\n\r\nThe strips of hide, when well tanned and prepared, made valuable\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nMuch damage had been done by the late storm. The heavy rain had flooded\r\nall the streams, and injured crops which should have been housed before\r\nthe regular rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe bridge over Jackal River was partly broken down, and the water tanks\r\nand pipes all needed repair. So our time was much occupied in restoring\r\nthings to order.\r\n\r\nOn going to work one day, near the cascade, we found a great number of\r\ndark red berries scattered on the ground; they were about the size of\r\nordinary hazel nuts, with small leafy coronets at the tip.\r\n\r\nThe boys thought them so inviting, that they tasted them at once, but\r\nangry exclamations and much spitting and spluttering followed the\r\nexperiment; even Knips rejected them, and they would have been cast\r\naside with contempt, had not the smell induced me to examine them. I\r\ndecided that this was the fruit of the clove.\r\n\r\nSome plants were immediately set in the nursery garden, and my wife was\r\npleased to have this excellent spice wherewith to flavor her boiled rice\r\nand other dishes, in lieu of pepper--a very welcome variety to everyone.\r\n\r\nHaving a good supply of clay, brought from the bed near Falconhurst, I\r\nproposed to use it for making aqueducts; and, observing how much the\r\nrecent rain had promoted the growth of our young corn, I determined to\r\nirrigate the fields with the drainage from our crushing mill.\r\n\r\nThe fishing season was again successful. Large takes of salmon,\r\nsturgeon, and herring rewarded our annual exertions, and our storeroom\r\nagain assumed a well-stocked appearance. Much as I wished that we could\r\nobtain a constant supply of these fish fresh, I was obliged to reject\r\nthe na\xefve proposal from Jack, that we should tether a shoal of salmon by\r\nthe gills to the bottom of the bay as we had secured the turtles.\r\n\r\nMany quiet uneventful days passed by, and I perceived that the boys,\r\nwearied by the routine of farm work at Rockburg, were longing for a\r\ncruise in the yacht or an expedition into the woods, which would refresh\r\nboth mind and body.\r\n\r\n"Father," said Fritz at length, "we want a quantity of hurdles, and have\r\nscarcely any more bamboos of which to make them. Had we not better get a\r\nsupply from Woodlands? And you said, too, the other day, that you wished\r\nyou had some more of the fine clay: we might visit the Gap at the same\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nI had really no objection to propose; and it was shortly afterward\r\nsettled that Fritz, Jack, and Franz should start together; and that\r\nErnest, who had no great desire to accompany his brothers, should remain\r\nwith his mother and me, and assist in the construction of a sugar mill,\r\nthe erection of which I had long contemplated.\r\n\r\nBefore they started, Fritz begged some bear\'s meat from the mother, to\r\nmake pemmican.\r\n\r\n"And what may pemmican be?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"It is food carried by the fur-traders of North America on their long\r\njourneys through the wild country they traverse; and consists of bear or\r\ndeer\'s flesh, first cooked and then pounded or ground to powder. It is\r\nvery portable, and nourishing."\r\n\r\nHis mother consented "to humor him," as she said, although without much\r\nfaith in the value of the preparation; and in the course of two days a\r\nstock of pemmican, sufficient for a Polar expedition, was fabricated by\r\nour enthusiastic son.\r\n\r\nThey were ready to start, when I observed Jack quietly slip a basket,\r\ncontaining several pigeons, under the packages in the cart.\r\n\r\n"Oh, oh!" thought I, "the little fellow has his doubts about that\r\npemmican, and thinks a tough old pigeon would be preferable."\r\n\r\nThe weather was exquisite; and, with exhortations to prudence and\r\ncaution from both me and their mother, the three lads started in the\r\nvery highest spirits. Storm and Grumble, as usual, drew the cart, and\r\nwere ridden by Fritz and Franz; while Hurry carried Jack swiftly across\r\nthe bridge in advance of them; followed by Floss and Bruno, barking at\r\nhis heels.\r\n\r\nThe sugar mill occupied us for several days, and was made so much like\r\nour other mills that I need not now describe it.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the first day, as we sat resting in the porch at\r\nRockburg, we naturally talked of the absentees, wondering and guessing\r\nwhat they might be about.\r\n\r\nErnest looked rather mysterious, and hinted that he might have news of\r\nthem next morning.\r\n\r\nJust then a bird alighted on the dovecot, and entered. I could not see,\r\nin the failing light, whether it was one of our own pigeons or an\r\nintruder. Ernest started up, and said he would see that all was right.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he returned with a scrap of paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n"News, father! The very latest news by pigeon post, mother!"\r\n\r\n"Well done, boys! what a capital idea!" said I, and taking the note I\r\nread:\r\n\r\n     "DEAREST PARENTS AND ERNEST:\r\n\r\n     "A brute of a hyena has killed a ram and two lambs. The dogs seized\r\n     it. Franz shot it. It is dead and skinned. The pemmican isn\'t worth\r\n     much, but we are all right. Love to all.\r\n\r\n                                                        "FRITZ.\r\n    "WOODLANDS, 15th instant."\r\n\r\n"A true hunter\'s letter!" laughed I; "but what exciting news. When does\r\nthe next post come in, Ernest?"\r\n\r\n"To-night, I hope," said he, while his mother sighed, and doubted the\r\nvalue of such glimpses into the scenes of danger through which her sons\r\nwere passing, declaring she would much rather wait and hear all about it\r\nwhen she had them safe home again.\r\n\r\nThus the winged letter-carriers kept us informed from day to day of the\r\noutline of adventures which were afterward more fully described.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the farm at Woodlands, the boys were startled by hearing,\r\nas they thought, human laughter, repeated again and again; while, to\r\ntheir astonishment, the oxen testified the great uneasiness, the dogs\r\ngrowled and drew close to their masters, and the ostrich fairly bolted\r\nwith Jack into the rice swamp.\r\n\r\nThe laughter continued, and the beasts became unmanageable.\r\n\r\n"Something is very far wrong!" cried Fritz. "I cannot leave the animals;\r\nbut while I unharness them, do you, Franz, take the dogs, and advance\r\ncautiously to see what is the matter."\r\n\r\nWithout a moment\'s hesitation, Franz made his way among the bushes with\r\nhis gun, closely followed by the dogs; until, through an opening in the\r\nthicket, he could see, at a distance of about forty paces, an enormous\r\nhyena, in the most wonderful state of excitement; dancing round a lamb\r\njust killed, and uttering, from time to time, the ghastly hysterical\r\nlaughter which had pealed through the forest.\r\n\r\nThe beast kept running backward and forward, rising on its hind legs,\r\nand then rapidly whirling round and round, nodding its head, and going\r\nthrough most frantic and ludicrous antics.\r\n\r\nFranz kept his presence of mind very well; for he watched till, calming\r\ndown, the hyena began with horrid growls to tear its prey; and then,\r\nfiring steadily both barrels, he broke its foreleg, and wounded it in\r\nthe breast.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fritz, having unyoked the oxen and secured them to trees,\r\nhurried to his brother\'s assistance. The dogs and the dying hyena were\r\nby this time engaged in mortal strife; but the latter, although it\r\nseverely wounded both Floss and Bruno, speedily succumbed, and was dead\r\nwhen the boys reached the spot. They raised a shout of triumph, which\r\nguided Jack to the scene of action; and their first care was for the\r\ndogs, whose wounds they dressed before minutely examining the hyena. It\r\nwas as large as a wild boar; long stiff bristles formed a mane on its\r\nneck, its color was gray marked with black, the teeth and jaws were of\r\nextraordinary strength, the thighs muscular and sinewy, the claws\r\nremarkably strong and sharp altogether. But for his wounds he would\r\ncertainly have been more than a match for the dogs.\r\n\r\nAfter unloading the cart at the farm, the boys returned for the carcass\r\nof the tiger-wolf, as it is sometimes called, and occupied themselves in\r\nskinning it during the remainder of the day, when, after dispatching the\r\ncarrier-pigeon to Rockburg, they retired to rest on their bearskin rugs,\r\nto dream of adventures past and future.\r\n\r\nThe following day they devised no less a scheme than to survey the\r\nshores of Wood Lake, and place marks wherever the surrounding marsh was\r\npracticable, and might be crossed either to reach the water or leave\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFritz in the cajack, and the boys on shore, carefully examined the\r\nground together; and when they found firm footing to the water\'s edge,\r\nthe spot was indicated by planting a tall bamboo, bearing on high a\r\nbundle of reeds and branches.\r\n\r\nThey succeeded in capturing three young black swans, after considerable\r\nresistance from the old ones. They were afterward brought to Rockburg,\r\nand detained as ornaments to Safety Bay.\r\n\r\nPresently a beautiful heron thrust his long neck from among the reeds,\r\nto ascertain what all the noise on the lake was about. Before he could\r\nsatisfy his curiosity, Fritz unhooded his eagle, and though vainly he\r\nflapped and struggled, his legs and wings were gently but firmly bound,\r\nand he had to own himself vanquished, and submit to the inspection of\r\nhis delighted captors.\r\n\r\nIt was their turn to be alarmed next, for a large powerful animal came\r\npuffing, with a curious whistling sound, through the dense thicket of\r\nreeds, passing close by and sorely discomposing them by its sudden\r\nappearance. It was out of sight immediately, before they could summon\r\nthe dogs, and from their description it must have been a tapir, the\r\ncolor dark brown, and in form resembling a young rhinoceros, but with no\r\nhorn on the nose, and the upper lip prolonged into a trunk something\r\nlike that of an elephant on a smaller scale. It is a gentle creature,\r\nbut when attacked becomes a fierce opponent, and can wound dogs\r\ndangerously with its powerful teeth.\r\n\r\nThe tapir can swim and dive with perfect ease, and abounds in the\r\ndensely wooded swamps and rivers of tropical America.\r\n\r\nFritz in his cajack followed for a time the direction in which the tapir\r\nproceeded, but saw no more of it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the other two boys returned to the farm by the rice fields,\r\nand there fell in with a flock of cranes, five or six of which they\r\ncaught alive, among them two demoiselles or Numidian cranes. These birds\r\nthey shot at with arrows arranged in a skillful and original way, with\r\nloops of cord dipped in birdlime attached to them, so that it often\r\nhappened that the bird aimed at was entangled and brought down\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\nThe young hunters seemed to have lived very comfortably on peccary ham,\r\ncassava bread and fruit, and plenty of baked potatoes and milk.\r\n\r\nOne trial of the pemmican was sufficient, and it was handed over to the\r\ndogs. Fritz, however, determined again to attempt the manufacture,\r\nknowing its value when properly prepared.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting a supply of rice and cotton, they took their way to\r\nProspect Hill; "and," said Fritz, as he afterward vividly described the\r\ndreadful scene there enacted, "when we entered the pine wood, we found\r\nit in possession of troops of monkeys, who resolved to make our passage\r\nthrough it as disagreeable as possible, for they howled and chattered at\r\nus like demons, pelting us as hard as they could with pine cones.\r\n\r\n"They became so unbearable, that at last we fired a few shot right and\r\nleft among them; several bit the dust, the rest fled, and we continued\r\nour way in peace to Prospect Hill, but only to discover the havoc the\r\nwretches had made there.\r\n\r\n"Would you believe it, father? The pleasant cottage had been overrun\r\nand ruined by apes just as Woodland last summer! The most dreadful dirt\r\nand disorder met our eyes wherever we turned, and we had hard work to\r\nmake the place fit for human habitation; and even then we preferred the\r\ntent. I felt quite at loss how to guard the farm for the future; but\r\nseeing a bottle of the poisonous gum of the euphorbia in the tool chest,\r\nI devised a plan for the destruction of the apes which succeeded beyond\r\nmy expectations.\r\n\r\n"I mixed poison with milk, bruised millet, and anything I thought the\r\nmonkeys would eat, and put it in cocoanut shells, which I hung about in\r\nthe trees, high enough to be out of reach of our own animals. The\r\nevening was calm and lovely; the sea murmured in the distance, and the\r\nrising moon shed a beauty over the landscape which we seemed never\r\nbefore to have so admired and enjoyed. The summer night closed around us\r\nin all its solemn stillness, and our deepest feelings were touched; when\r\nsuddenly the spell was broken by an outburst of the most hideous and\r\ndiscordant noises. As by one consent, every beast of the forest seemed\r\nto arise from its den, and utter its wild nocturnal cry. Snorting,\r\nsnarling, and shrieking filled the wood beneath us.\r\n\r\n"From the hills echoed the mournful howl of the jackals, answered by\r\nFangs in the yard, who was backed up by the barking and yelping of his\r\nfriends Floss and Bruno. Far away beyond the rocky fastnesses of the\r\nGap, sounded unearthly, hollow snortings and neighings, reminding one of\r\nthe strange cry of the hippopotamus; above these, occasional deep\r\nmajestic roaring made our hearts quail with the conviction that we heard\r\nthe voices of lions and elephants.\r\n\r\n"Overawed and silent, we retired to rest, hoping to forget in sleep the\r\nterrors of the midnight forest, but ere long the most fearful cries in\r\nthe adjoining woods gave notice that the apes were beginning to suffer\r\nfrom the poisoned repast prepared for them.\r\n\r\n"As our dogs could not remain silent amid the uproar and din, we had not\r\na wink of sleep until the morning. It was late, therefore, when we rose,\r\nand looked on the awful spectacle presented by the multitude of dead\r\nmonkeys and baboons thickly strewn under the trees round the farm. I\r\nshall not tell you how many there were. I can only say, I wished I had\r\nnot found the poison, and we made all haste to clear away the dead\r\nbodies, and the dangerous food, burying some deep in the earth, and,\r\ncarrying the rest to the shore, we pitched them over the rocks into the\r\nsea. That day we traveled on to the Gap."\r\n\r\nThe same evening that the boys reached the rocky pass, a messenger\r\npigeon arrived at Rockburg, bearing a note which concluded in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n"The barricade at the Gap broken down. Everything laid waste as far as\r\nthe sugar-brake, where the hut is knocked to pieces, and the fields\r\ntrampled over by huge footmarks. Come to us, father--we are safe, but\r\nfeel we are no match for this unknown danger."\r\n\r\nI lost not an instant, but saddled Swift, late as it was, in order to\r\nride to the assistance of our boys, desiring Ernest to prepare the small\r\ncart, and follow me with his mother at daybreak, bringing everything we\r\nshould require for camping out for some days.\r\n\r\nThe bright moonlight favored my journey, and my arrival at the Gap\r\nsurprised and delighted the boys, who did not expect me till the next\r\nday. Early on the following morning I inspected the footprints and\r\nravages of the great unknown. The cane brake had, without doubt, been\r\nvisited by an elephant. That great animal alone could have left such\r\ntraces and committed such fearful ravages. Thick posts in the barricade\r\nwere snapped across like reeds; the trees in the vicinity, where we\r\nplanned to build a cool summer-house, were stripped of leaves and\r\nbranches to a great height, but the worst mischief was done among the\r\nyoung sugar-cane plants, which were all either devoured or trampled down\r\nand destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that not one elephant, but a troop must have invaded our\r\ngrounds. The tracks were very numerous, and the footprints of various\r\nsizes; but, to my satisfaction, I saw that they could be traced not only\r\nfrom the Gap, but back to it in evidently equal numbers.\r\n\r\nWe did not, therefore, suppose that the mighty animals remained hidden\r\nin the woods of our territory; but concluded that, after this\r\nfreebooting incursion, they had withdrawn to their native wilds, where,\r\nby greatly increasing the strength of our ramparts, we hoped henceforth\r\nto oblige them to remain.\r\n\r\nIn what manner to effect this we laid many plans, during the night of\r\nmy arrival, when, sitting by an enormous watch-fire, I chatted with my\r\nboys, and heard details of their numerous adventures, so interesting for\r\nthem to relate, and for me to hear, that every one was more disposed to\r\nact sentinel than retire to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe mother and Ernest arrived next day, and she rejoiced to find all\r\nwell, making light of trodden fields and trampled sugar-canes, since her\r\nsons were sound in life and limb.\r\n\r\nA systematic scheme of defense was now elaborated, and the erection of\r\nthe barricade occupied us for at least a month, as it was to be a firm\r\nand durable building, proof against all invasion. As our little tent was\r\nunsuited to a long residence of this sort, I adopted Fritz\'s idea of a\r\nKamschatchan dwelling, and, to his great delight, forthwith carried it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nInstead of planting four posts, on which to place a platform, we chose\r\nfour trees of equal size, which, in a very suitable place, grew exactly\r\nin a square, twelve or fourteen feet apart. Between these, at about\r\ntwenty feet from the ground, we laid a flooring of beams and bamboo,\r\nsmoothly and strongly planked. From this rose, on all four sides, walls\r\nof cane; the frame of the roof was covered so effectually by large\r\npieces of bark that no rain could penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe staircase to this tree-cottage was simply a board plank with bars\r\nnailed across it for steps. The flooring projected like a balcony in\r\nfront of the entrance door, and underneath, on the ground, we fitted up\r\nsheds for cattle and fowls.\r\n\r\nVarious ornaments in Chinese or Japanese style were added to the roof\r\nand eaves, and a most convenient, cool, and picturesque cottage,\r\noverhung and adorned by the graceful foliage of the trees, was the\r\nresult of our ingenuity.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to find that the various birds taken by the boys during\r\nthis excursion seemed likely to thrive; they were the first inmates of\r\nthe new sheds, and even the black swans and cranes soon became tame and\r\nsociable.\r\n\r\nConstantly roaming through the woods, the children often made new\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nFritz brought one day, after an excursion to the opposite side of the\r\nstream beyond the Gap, a cluster of bananas, and also of cacao beans,\r\nfrom which chocolate is made.\r\n\r\nThe banana, although valuable and nourishing food for the natives of the\r\ntropical countries where it grows, is not generally liked by Europeans,\r\nand probably this variety was even inferior to many others, for we found\r\nthe fruit much like rotten pears, and almost uneatable.\r\n\r\nThe cacao seeds tasted exceedingly bitter, and it seemed wonderful that\r\nby preparation they should produce anything so delicious as chocolate.\r\n\r\nMy wife, who now fancied no manufacture beyond my skill, begged for\r\nplants, seeds, or cuttings to propagate in her nursery garden, already\r\nfancying herself in the enjoyment of chocolate for breakfast, and I\r\npromised to make a cacao plantation near home.\r\n\r\n"Let me have bananas also," said she, "for we may acquire a taste for\r\nthat celebrated fruit, and, at all events, I am sure I can make it into\r\nan excellent preserve."\r\n\r\nThe day before our return to Rockburg, Fritz went again to the inland\r\nregion beyond the river to obtain a large supply of young banana plants,\r\nand the cacao fruit. He took the cajack, and a bundle of reeds to float\r\nbehind him as a raft to carry the fruit, plants, and anything else he\r\nmight wish to bring back.\r\n\r\nOn the evening he made his appearance, coming swiftly down stream. His\r\nbrothers rushed to meet him, each eager to see and help to land his\r\ncargo.\r\n\r\nErnest and Fritz were quickly running up the bank, with arms full of\r\nplants, branches, and fruits, when Fritz handed to Jack a dripping wet\r\nbag which he had brought along partly under water. A curious pattering\r\nnoise proceeded from this bag, but they kept the contents a secret for\r\nthe present, Jack running with it behind a bush before peeping in, and I\r\ncould just hear him exclaim:\r\n\r\n"Hullo! I say, what monsters they are. It\'s enough to make a fellow\'s\r\nflesh creep to look at them!"\r\n\r\nWith that he hastily shut up the bag, and put it away safely out of\r\nsight in water.\r\n\r\nSecuring the cajack, Fritz sprang toward us, his handsome face radiant\r\nwith pleasure, as he exhibited a beautiful waterfowl.\r\n\r\nIts plumage was rich purple, changing on the back to dark green; the\r\nlegs, feet, and a mark above the bill, bright red. This lovely bird I\r\nconcluded to be the sultan cock described by Buffon, and as it was\r\ngentle, we gladly received it among our domestic pets.\r\n\r\nFritz gave a stirring account of his exploring trip, having made his way\r\nfar up the river, between fertile plains and majestic forests of lofty\r\ntrees, where the cries of vast numbers of birds, parrots, peacocks,\r\nguinea fowls, and hundreds unknown to him, quite bewildered, and made\r\nhim feel giddy.\r\n\r\n"It was in the Buffalo Swamp," continued he, "that I saw the splendid\r\nbirds you call sultan cocks, and I set my heart on catching one alive,\r\nwhich, as they seemed to have little fear of my approach, I managed by\r\nmeans of a wire snare. Farther on I saw a grove of mimosa trees, among\r\nwhich huge dark masses were moving in a deliberate way. Guess what they\r\nwere!"\r\n\r\n"Savages?" asked Franz timidly.\r\n\r\n"Black bears, I bet!" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n"Your words suggest to my mind the manner and appearance of elephants,"\r\nsaid Ernest.\r\n\r\n"Right you are, Professor!" exclaimed Fritz gaily, the words producing\r\nquite a sensation on the whole attentive family. "From fifteen to twenty\r\nelephants were feeding peacefully on the leafy boughs, tearing down\r\nbranches with their trunks and shoving them into their mouths with one\r\njerk, or bathing in the deep waters of the marsh for refreshment in the\r\ngreat heat. You cannot imagine the wild grandeur of the scene! The\r\nriver being very broad, I felt safe from wild animals, and more than\r\nonce saw splendid jaguars crouched on the banks, their glossy skin\r\nglancing in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n"While considering if it would be simply foolhardy to try a shot at one\r\nof these creatures, I was suddenly convinced that discretion is the\r\nbetter part of valor, and urging my canoe into the center current, made\r\na rapid retreat down the river. For just before me, in the calm deep\r\nwater of a sheltered bay where I was quietly floating, there arose a\r\nviolent boiling, bubbling commotion, and for an instant I thought a hot\r\nspring was going to burst forth--instead of that, uprose the hideous\r\nhead and gaping jaws of a hippopotamus, who, with a hoarse, terrific\r\nsnort, seemed about to attack me. I can tell you I did not wait to see\r\nthe rest of him! a glimpse of his enormous mouth and its array of white\r\ngleaming tusks was quite enough. \'Right about face!\' said I to myself,\r\nand shot down the stream like an arrow, never pausing till a bend in the\r\nriver brought me within sight of the Gap, where I once more felt safe,\r\nand joyfully made my way back to you all."\r\n\r\nThis narrative was of thrilling interest to us, proving the existence of\r\ntribes of the most formidable animals beyond the rocky barrier which\r\ndefended, in so providential a manner, the small and fertile territory\r\non which our lot was cast.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the adventurer we had been busily engaged in\r\nmaking preparations for our departure--and everything was packed up and\r\nready by the morning after his return.\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation I yielded to his great wish, which was to return\r\nby sea in his cajack round Cape Disappointment, and so meet us at\r\nRockburg.\r\n\r\nHe was much interested in examining the outlines of the coast and the\r\nrugged precipices of the Cape. These were tenanted by vast flocks of sea\r\nfowl and birds of prey; while many varieties of shrubs and plants,\r\nhitherto unknown to us, grew in the clefts and crevices of the rocks,\r\nsome of them diffusing a strong aromatic odor. Among the specimens he\r\nbrought I recognized the caper plant, and, with still greater pleasure,\r\na shrub which was, I felt sure, the tea-plant of China--it bore very\r\npretty white flowers, and the leaves resembled myrtle.\r\n\r\nOur land journey was effected without accident or adventure of any kind.\r\n\r\nJack, mounted as usual on Hurry, the ostrich, carried the mysterious wet\r\nbag very carefully slung at his side, and when near home started off at\r\na prodigious rate in advance of us.\r\n\r\nHe let fall the drawbridge, and we saw no more of him until, on reaching\r\nRockburg, he appeared leisurely returning from the swamp, where\r\napparently he had gone to deposit his "moist secret," as Franz called\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe were all glad to take up our quarters once more in our large and\r\nconvenient dwelling, and my first business was to provide for the great\r\nnumber of birds we now had on our hands, by establishing them in\r\nsuitable localities, it being impossible to maintain them all in the\r\npoultry yard. Some were, therefore, taken to the islands; and the black\r\nswans, the heron, the graceful demoiselle cranes, and our latest\r\nacquisition, the splendid sultan cock, soon became perfectly at home in\r\nthe swamp, greatly adding to the interest of the neighborhood of Safety\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nThe old bustards were the tamest of all our feathered pets, and never\r\nmore so than at meal times. They were unfailing in their attendance when\r\nwe dined or supped in the open air.\r\n\r\nToward evening, as we sat in the veranda listening to Fritz\'s account of\r\nhis trip round the Cape, an extraordinary hollow, roaring noise sounded\r\nfrom the swamp not unlike the angry bellowing of a bull.\r\n\r\nThe dogs barked, and the family rose in excitement; but I remarked a\r\nlook of quiet humor in Fritz\'s eye, as he stood leaning against one of\r\nthe veranda pillars, watching Jack, who, in some confusion, started off\r\ntoward the marsh.\r\n\r\n"Come back, you silly boy!" cried his mother; "the child has not so much\r\nas a pistol, and is rushing off alone to face he knows not what!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said I, looking at Fritz, "this is not a case requiring the\r\nuse of firearms. It may be only the booming of a bittern which we hear."\r\n\r\n"You need not be uneasy, mother," said Fritz; "Jack knows what he is\r\nabout; only this charming serenade took him by surprise, and I fancy he\r\nwill have to exhibit his treasures before they reach perfection. Yes,\r\nhere he comes!"\r\n\r\nLugging his "moist secret" along with him, Jack, flushed and breathless,\r\ncame up to us, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"They were to grow as big as rabbits before you saw them! Such a shame!\r\nI never thought they would kick up a row like that. Now for it!"--and he\r\nturned out the bag. "This is \'Grace,\' and this is \'Beauty.\'"\r\n\r\nTwo immense frogs rolled clumsily on the ground, and recovering their\r\nfeet, sat squat before us, swelling and puffing with a ludicrous air of\r\ninsulted dignity, while peals of laughter greeted them on all sides.\r\n\r\n"Ladies and Gentleman, these are two very handsome young specimens of\r\nthe famous African bullfrog," said Jack, pretending to be offended at\r\nthe mingled disgust and amusement occasioned by their appearance; "they\r\nare but half-grown, and I hoped to maintain them in seclusion until they\r\nreached full size, when I would have introduced them with proper\r\n_\xe9clat_. But since their talent for music has brought them precociously\r\ninto public notice, I must beg for your kind and indulgent patronage,\r\nand--leave to take them back to the swamp!"\r\n\r\nGreat clapping of hands followed Jack\'s speech.\r\n\r\n"Grace" and "Beauty" were examined, and commented on with much interest,\r\nand voted decidedly handsome "in their way."\r\n\r\nTheir general color was greenish brown, mottled and spotted with\r\nreddish brown and yellow; the sides green and black; the under part\r\nyellow, mottled with orange. The eyes were positively beautiful, of a\r\nrich chestnut hue, covered with golden white dots, which shone with a\r\nmetallic luster. The skin of the body was puckered into longitudinal\r\nfolds.\r\n\r\nBy general consent they were remanded to the swamp.\r\n\r\nShortly after our return to Rockburg, my wife drew my attention to the\r\nsomewhat neglected state of our dear old summer residence at\r\nFalconhurst, begging me to devote some time to its restoration and\r\nembellishment.\r\n\r\nThis I most willingly undertook, and we removed thither, as soon as the\r\nboys had completed the arrangement of the artificial salt-lick to their\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt Falconhurst things were quickly in good order, and we made a great\r\nimprovement by completing the broad terrace supported on the arching\r\nroots of the trees--it was better floored--and rustic pillars and\r\ntrellis-work sustained a bark roof which afforded a pleasant shade.\r\n\r\nAfter this was done, I was compelled to consent to a plan long cherished\r\nby Fritz, who wished to construct a watch-tower and mount a gun on Shark\r\nIsland. After great exertion, both mental and bodily, this piece of\r\nmilitary engineering was completed; and a flagstaff erected, on which\r\nthe guard at this outpost could run up a white flag to signal the\r\napproach of anything harmless from the sea, while a red flag would be\r\nshown on the least appearance of danger.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the completion of this great work, which occupied us during\r\ntwo months, we hoisted the white flag, and fired a salute of six guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n Ten years afterward--Our farms and farmyards--Fritz makes a voyage of\r\n     discovery--Cape Minster and the swallows\' nests--Pearl oysters--A\r\n     magnificent bay--The strange message--An excursion to Pearl\r\n     Bay--Fritz proposes to search for the stranger, and prepares his\r\n     canoe for her reception--The pearl fishery--An encounter with a\r\n     wild boar--Jack\'s accident--Truffles--A midnight alarm--The lion\r\n     and his mate--Our enemies overcome--Juno\'s death--We set sail for\r\n     Rockburg--Fritz leaves us.\r\n\r\n\r\n"We spend our years as a tale that is told," said King David.\r\n\r\nThese words recurred to me again and again as I reviewed ten years, of\r\nwhich the story lay chronicled in the pages of my journal.\r\n\r\nYear followed year; chapter succeeded chapter; steadily, imperceptibly,\r\ntime was passing away.\r\n\r\nThe shade of sadness cast on my mind by retrospect of this kind was\r\ndispelled by thoughts full of gratitude to God, for the welfare and\r\nhappiness of my beloved family during so long a period. I had cause\r\nespecially to rejoice in seeing our sons advance to manhood,\r\nstrengthened by early training for lives of usefulness and activity\r\nwherever their lot might fall.\r\n\r\nAnd my great wish is, that young people who read this record of our\r\nlives and adventures should learn from it how admirably suited is the\r\npeaceful, industrious, and pious life of a cheerful, united family, to\r\nthe formation of strong, pure, and manly character.\r\n\r\nNone take a better place in the great national family, none are happier\r\nor more beloved than those who go forth from such homes to fulfill new\r\nduties, and to gather fresh interests around them.\r\n\r\nHaving given a detailed account of several years\' residence in New\r\nSwitzerland, as we liked to call our dominion, it is needless for me to\r\ncontinue what would exhaust the patience of the most long-suffering, by\r\nrepeating monotonous narratives of exploring parties and hunting\r\nexpeditions, wearisome descriptions of awkward inventions and clumsy\r\nmachines, with an endless record of discoveries, more fit for the pages\r\nof an encyclopedia than a book of family history.\r\n\r\nYet before winding up with the concluding events, I may mention some\r\ninteresting facts illustrative of our exact position at the time these\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nRockburg and Falconhurst continued to be our winter and summer\r\nheadquarters, and improvements were added which made them more and more\r\nconvenient, as well as attractive in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe fountains, trellised verandas, and plantations round Rockburg,\r\ncompletely changed the character of the residence which, on account of\r\nthe heat and want of vegetation, had in former days been so distasteful\r\nto my wife. Flowering creepers overhung the balconies and pillars; while\r\nshrubs and trees, both native and European, grew luxuriantly in groves\r\nof our planting.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, Shark Island, now clothed with graceful palms, guarded\r\nthe entrance to Safety Bay, the battery and flagstaff prominently\r\nvisible on its crested rock.\r\n\r\nThe swamp, cleared and drained, was now a considerable lake, with just\r\nmarsh and reeds enough beyond it to form good cover for the waterfowl\r\nwhose favorite retreat it was.\r\n\r\nOn its blue waters sailed stately black swans, snow-white geese, and\r\nrichly colored ducks; while out and in among the water plants and rushes\r\nwould appear at intervals glimpses of the brilliant sultan, marsh-fowl,\r\ncrimson flamingos, soft, blue-gray, demoiselle cranes, and crested\r\nheron, all associating in harmony, and with no fear of us, their\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nThe giant frogs, Grace and Beauty, delighted Jack by actually attaining\r\nin time to the size of small rabbits; and, perfectly knowing their very\r\nappropriate names, would waddle out of the marsh at his call, to eat a\r\ngrasshopper or dainty fly.\r\n\r\nBeneath the spreading trees, and through the aromatic shrubberies, old\r\nHurry, the ostrich, was usually to be seen marching about, with grave\r\nand dignified pace, as though monarch of all he surveyed. Every variety\r\nof beautiful pigeon nested in the rocks and dovecots, their soft cooing\r\nand glossy plumage making them favorite household pets.\r\n\r\nBy the bridge alone could Rockburg be approached; for higher up the\r\nriver, where, near the cascade, it was fordable a dense and impenetrable\r\nthicket of orange and lemon trees, Indian figs, prickly pears, and all\r\nmanner of thorn-bearing shrubs, planted by us, now formed a complete\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit warren on Shark Island kept us well supplied with food, as\r\nwell as soft and useful fur; and, as the antelopes did not thrive on\r\nWhale Isle, they also were placed among the shady groves with the\r\nrabbits, and their own island devoted to such work as candle-making,\r\ntanning, wool-cleaning, and any other needful but offensive operations.\r\n\r\nThe farm at Woodlands flourished, and our flocks and herds supplied us\r\nwith mutton, beef, and veal, while my wife\'s dairy was almost more than\r\nshe could manage.\r\n\r\nMy boys retained their old love for giving names to the animals. They\r\nhad a beautiful creamy-white cow called Blanche, and a bull with such a\r\ntremendous voice, that he received the name of Stentor. Two fleet young\r\nonagers were named Arrow and Dart; and Jack had a descendant of his old\r\nfavorite Fangs, the jackal, which he chose to call Coco, asserting that\r\nno word could be distinguished at a distance without the letter "o" in\r\nit, giving illustrations of his theory, till our ears were almost\r\ndeafened.\r\n\r\nExcellent health had been enjoyed by us all during these ten years,\r\nthough my wife occasionally suffered from slight attacks of fever, and\r\nthe boys sometimes met with little accidents.\r\n\r\nThey were all fine, handsome fellows; Fritz, now twenty-four, was of\r\nmoderate height, uncommonly strong, active, muscular, and high-spirited.\r\n\r\nErnest, two years younger, was tall and slight; in disposition, mild,\r\ncalm, and studious; his early faults of indolence and selfishness were\r\nalmost entirely overcome. He possessed refined tastes and great\r\nintellectual power.\r\n\r\nJack, at twenty, strongly resembled Fritz, being about his height,\r\nthough more lightly built, and remarkable rather for active grace and\r\nagility than for muscular strength.\r\n\r\nFranz, a lively youth of seventeen, had some of the qualities of each of\r\nhis brothers; he possessed wit and shrewdness, but not the arch drollery\r\nof Jack.\r\n\r\nAll were honorable, God-fearing young men, dutiful and affectionate to\r\ntheir mother and myself, and warmly attached to each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough so many years had elapsed in total seclusion, it continued to\r\nbe my strong impression that we should one day be restored to the\r\nsociety of our fellow-men.\r\n\r\nBut time, which was bringing our sons to manhood, was also carrying\r\ntheir parents onward to old age; and anxious, gloomy thoughts relating\r\nto their future, should they be left indeed alone, sometimes oppressed\r\nmy heart.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions, I would not communicate the sense of depression to my\r\nfamily, but, turning in prayer to the Almighty Father, laid my trouble\r\nbefore Him, with never-failing renewal of strength and hope.\r\n\r\nMy elder sons often made expeditions of which we knew nothing until\r\ntheir return after many hours; when any uneasiness I might have felt was\r\ndissipated by their joyous appearance, and reproof always died away on\r\nmy lips.\r\n\r\nFritz had been absent one whole day from Rockburg, and not until\r\nevening did we remark that his cajack was gone, and that he must be out\r\nat sea.\r\n\r\nAnxious to see him return before nightfall, I went off to Shark Island\r\nwith Ernest and Jack, in order to look out for him from the watch tower\r\nthere, at the same time hoisting our signal flag, and loading the gun.\r\n\r\nLong we gazed across the expanse of ocean glittering in the level beams\r\nof the setting sun, and finally discerned a small black speck in the\r\ndistance which, by the telescope, was proved to be the returning\r\nwanderer.\r\n\r\nI remarked that his skiff sailed at a slower rate than usual toward the\r\nshore. The cannon was fired to let him know that his approach was\r\nobserved, and then we joyfully hurried back to receive him at the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see, as he drew near, what had delayed his progress. The\r\ncajack towed a large sack, besides being heavily laden.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, Fritz!" I cried. "Welcome back, wherever you come from, and\r\nwhatever you bring. You seem to have quite a cargo there!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and my trip has led to discoveries as well as booty," answered he;\r\n"interesting discoveries which will tempt us again in the same\r\ndirection. Come, boys, let\'s carry up the things, and while I rest I\r\nwill relate my adventures."\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible all assembled round him.\r\n\r\n"I think my absence without leave deserves reproach instead of this warm\r\nreception, father, and I must apologize for it," he began. "But ever\r\nsince I possessed the cajack it has been my ambition to make a voyage of\r\ndiscovery along the coast, which we have never explored beyond the point\r\nat which I killed the walrus.\r\n\r\n"In order to be ready to start without delay when a convenient\r\nopportunity offered, I made preparations beforehand, such as\r\nprovisioning my skiff, fixing the compass in front of my seat, arranging\r\nconveniently rifle, harpoon, ax, boat-hook, and fishing net. I also\r\nresolved to take with me Pounce, my eagle, and this I always will do in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n"This morning dawned magnificently; the calm sea, the gentle breeze, all\r\ndrew me irresistibly to the fulfillment of my purpose.\r\n\r\n"I left the harbor unperceived, the current quickly bore me out to sea,\r\nand I rounded the point to the left, passing just over the spot where,\r\nbeneath the waves, lie the guns, cannon balls, ironwork, and all that\r\nwas indestructible about our good old wreck. And would you believe it?\r\nThrough the glassy clear water, undisturbed by a ripple, I actually saw\r\nmany such things strewn on the flat rocky bottom.\r\n\r\n"Pursuing my way, I passed among rugged cliffs and rocks which jutted\r\nout from the shore, or rose in rugged masses from the water. Myriads of\r\nsea fowl inhabited the most inaccessible of these, while on the lower\r\nridges, seals, sea bears, and walruses were to be seen, some basking\r\nlazily in the sun, some plunging into the water, or emerging awkwardly\r\nfrom it, hoisting their unwieldy bodies up the rocks by means of their\r\ntusks.\r\n\r\n"I must confess to feeling anything but comfortable while going through\r\nthe places held in possession by these monsters of the deep, and used\r\nevery effort to pass quickly and unnoticed. Yet it was more than an hour\r\nand a half before I got clear of the rocks, cliffs, and shoals to which\r\nthey resorted, and neared a high and precipitous cape, running far out\r\nto sea. Right opposite me, in the side of this rocky wall, was a\r\nmagnificent archway, forming, as it first appeared to me, a lofty\r\nentrance to an immense vaulted cavern. I passed beneath this noble\r\nportal and examined the interior. It was tenanted by numbers of a small\r\nspecies of swallow, scarcely larger than a wren, and the walls were\r\ncovered by thousands of their nests. They were rudely built, and their\r\npeculiarity was that each rested on a kind of platform, something like a\r\nspoon without the handle. I detached a number, and found that they had a\r\ncurious appearance, seemingly made of something fibrous and gelatinous,\r\nand more like a set of sponges, corals, or fungi, than nests of birds. I\r\nhave brought them home in my fishing net."\r\n\r\n"If we had commercial dealings with the Chinese," said I, "your\r\ndiscovery would be of value; these are doubtless edible birds\' nests.\r\nThe bird is called the esculent swallow, and the trade in this strange\r\narticle of diet is a very large one. The nests are of different value,\r\nbut those which are quite new, and nearly white, are held in such esteem\r\nthat they are worth their weight in silver.\r\n\r\n"There are tremendous caverns in Java and other places where, at great\r\nrisk, these nests are procured; the annual weight obtained being upward\r\nof fifty thousand pounds, and the value more than \xa3200,000.\r\n\r\n"When placed in water and well soaked, they soften and swell, and are\r\nmade into soup of very strengthening and restorative quality.\r\n\r\n"I think you might try your hand on these, mother, just for curiosity\'s\r\nsake."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say I fancy the look of the queer things," said she, "but I\r\ndon\'t mind trying if they will turn to jelly; though boiling birds\'\r\nnests is cookery quite out of my line."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do, mother; let us taste birds\' nests as soon as you can, though\r\nthe idea makes me fancy a mouth full of feathers!" laughed Jack.\r\n\r\n"It is really a most curious formation," said Fritz. "From whence are\r\nthe swallows supposed to get this kind of gelatine?"\r\n\r\n"It has never been exactly ascertained," I replied, "whether the birds\r\ndiscover or produce this curious substance. But whatever may be its\r\nbasis, it is clear that a very large portion of it is furnished by\r\ncertain glands, which pour out a viscid secretion."\r\n\r\n"After laying in my store of nests," continued Fritz, "I pursued my way\r\nthrough this vaulted cave or corridor; which, presently turning, opened\r\ninto a very lonely bay, so calm and lake-like, that, although of\r\nconsiderable size, I concluded at once it must be nearly land locked.\r\nIts shores, beyond the rocky boundary through which I penetrated,\r\nextended in a fertile plain toward what seemed the mouth of a river,\r\nbeyond which lay rough, and probably marshy, ground, and a dense forest\r\nof cedars, which closed the view.\r\n\r\n"The water beneath me was clear as crystal; and, gazing into its depths\r\nand shallows, I perceived beds of shell-fish, like large oysters,\r\nattached to the rocks and to each other by tufts of hairy filaments.\r\n\r\n"\'If these are oysters,\' thought I, \'they must be better worth eating,\r\nas far as size goes, than our little friends in Safety Bay,\' and\r\nthereupon I hooked up several clusters with my boat-hook, and landing\r\nsoon after on the beach, I flung them on the sand, resolving to fetch\r\nanother load, and then tow them after me in the fishing-net.\r\n\r\n"The hot sun disagreed with their constitution, I suppose; for when I\r\ncame back the shells were all gaping wide open; so I began to examine\r\nthem, thinking that after all they were probably much less delicate than\r\nthe small oysters we have learnt to like so much.\r\n\r\n"Somehow, when a thing is to be \'examined,\' one generally needs a knife.\r\nThe blade met with resistance here and there in the creature\'s body; and\r\nstill closer \'examination\' produced from it several pearly balls like\r\npeas, of different sizes. Do you think they can be pearls? I have a\r\nnumber here in a box."\r\n\r\n"Oh, show them to us, Fritz!" cried the boys. "What pretty shining\r\nthings! and how delicately rounded, and how softly they gleam!"\r\n\r\n"You have discovered treasure, indeed!" I exclaimed; "why these are most\r\nbeautiful pearls! Valueless, certainly, under present circumstances; but\r\nthey may prove a source of wealth, should we ever again come into\r\ncontact with the civilized world. We must visit your pearl-oyster beds\r\nat the earliest opportunity."\r\n\r\n"After resting for some time, and refreshing myself with food," pursued\r\nFritz, "I resumed my survey of the coast, my progress somewhat impeded\r\nby the bag of shell-fish, which I drew after me; but I proceeded without\r\naccident past the mouth of the stream to the further side of the bay,\r\nwhich was there inclosed by a point corresponding to that through which\r\nI had entered; and between these headlands I found a line of reefs and\r\nsandbanks, with but a single channel leading out to the open sea; from\r\nwhich, therefore, Pearl Bay, as I named it, lies completely sheltered.\r\n\r\n"The tide was setting strongly in shore, so that I could not then\r\nattempt a passage through it, but examined the crags of the headland,\r\nthinking I might perchance discover a second vaulted archway. I saw\r\nnothing remarkable, however, but thousands of sea fowl of every sort and\r\nkind, from the gull and sea swallow to the mighty albatross.\r\n\r\n"My approach was evidently regarded as an invasion and trespass; for\r\nthey regularly beset me, screaming and wheeling over my head, till, out\r\nof all patience, I stood up, and hit furiously about me with the\r\nboat-hook; when, rather to my surprise, one blow struck an albatross\r\nwith such force, that he fell stunned into the water.\r\n\r\n"I now once more attempted to cross the reef by the narrow channel, and\r\nhappily succeeding, found myself in the open sea, and speeding homeward,\r\njoyfully saw our flag flying, and heard the welcome salute you fired."\r\n\r\nHere ended the narrative; but next morning Fritz drew me aside, and\r\nconfided to me a most remarkable sequel, in these words:\r\n\r\n"There was something very extraordinary about that albatross, father. I\r\nallowed you to suppose that I left it as it fell, but in reality I\r\nraised it to the deck of the canoe, and then perceived a piece of rag\r\nwound round one of its legs. This I removed, and, to my utter\r\nastonishment, saw English words written on it, which I plainly made out\r\nto be: \'Save an unfortunate Englishwoman from the smoking rock!\'\r\n\r\n"This little sentence sent a thrill through every nerve: my brain seemed\r\nto whirl. I doubted the evidence of my senses.\r\n\r\n"\'Is this reality, or delusion?\' thought I. \'Can it be true, that a\r\nfellow-creature breathes with us the air of this lonely region?\'\r\n\r\n"I felt stupefied for some minutes: the bird began to show signs of\r\nlife, which recalled me to myself; and, quickly deciding what must be\r\ndone, I tore a strip from my handkerchief, on which I traced the\r\nwords--\'Do not despair! Help is near!\'\r\n\r\n"This I carefully bound round one leg, replacing the rag on the other,\r\nand then applied myself to the complete restoration of the bird. It\r\ngradually revived; and after drinking a little, surprised me by suddenly\r\nrising on the wing, faltering a moment in its flight, and then rapidly\r\ndisappearing from my view in a westerly direction.\r\n\r\n"Now, father, one thought occupies me continually: will my note ever\r\nreach this Englishwoman? Shall I be able to find, and to save her?"\r\n\r\nI listened to this account with feelings of the liveliest interest and\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"My dear son," said I, "you have done wisely in confiding to me alone\r\nyour most exciting discovery. Unless we know more, we must not unsettle\r\nthe others by speaking of it; for it appears to me quite possible that\r\nthese words were penned long ago on some distant shore, where, by this\r\ntime, the unhappy stranger may have perished miserably. By the \'smoking\r\nrock\' must be meant a volcano. There are none here."\r\n\r\nFritz was not disposed to look at the case from this gloomy point of\r\nview; did not think the rag so very old; believed smoke might rise from\r\na rock which was not volcanic; and evidently cherished the hope that he\r\nmight be able to respond effectually to this touching appeal.\r\n\r\nI was in reality as anxious as himself on the subject, but judged it\r\nprudent to abate rather than excite hopes of success which might be\r\ndoomed to bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\nAfter earnest consultation on the subject, we decided that Fritz should\r\ngo in search of the writer of the message, but not until he had so\r\naltered the canoe as to fit it for carrying two persons, as well as\r\nprovisions sufficient to admit of his absence for a considerable time.\r\nImpatient as he was, he could not but see the wisdom of this delay.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the house, and saw the boys busily opening the oysters,\r\nwhich they had had no time to do the previous night, and greatly excited\r\nas ever and anon a pearl was found.\r\n\r\n"May we not establish a pearl fishery at once, father?" shouted they.\r\n"We might build a hut on the shore of the bay, and set about it\r\nregularly."\r\n\r\nAn excursion to Pearl Bay was now the event to which all thoughts\r\nturned, and for which preparations on a grand scale were made. It was to\r\nform, as it were the basis of the more important voyage Fritz had in\r\nview, and to which, unsuspected by the rest, he could devote all his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI took an opportunity, one day, when all were present, to remark in a\r\nserious tone:\r\n\r\n"I have been considering, dear wife, that our eldest son is now of an\r\nage to be dependent on himself. I shall, therefore, henceforth leave him\r\nat liberty to act in all respects according to his own judgment; and,\r\nespecially in the matter of voyages or excursions, he must not be\r\nhampered by the fear of alarming us should he choose to remain absent\r\nlonger than we expect. I have such entire confidence in his prudence,\r\nand at the same time in his affection for us, that I am certain he will\r\nnever needlessly cause us anxiety."\r\n\r\nFritz looked gratefully toward me as I spoke; and his mother ratified my\r\nwords, embracing him affectionately, and saying, with emotion, "God\r\nbless and preserve thee, my boy!"\r\n\r\nIt took some time to make several raking or scraping machines, which I\r\ninvented for the purpose of detaching and lifting the oysters from their\r\nnative rocks; but that gave Fritz leisure to change the fittings of his\r\ncanoe, so as to have a spare seat in it.\r\n\r\nHis brothers naturally concluded he meant to take one of them as\r\nshipmate on board, and he allowed the mistake to continue. They occupied\r\nthemselves in making various articles they expected to be of use, and\r\nbore the delay with tolerable patience.\r\n\r\nAt last came the day, when, taking leave of the mother and Franz, we\r\nwent on board the yacht, accompanied by some of the dogs; while Jack,\r\nproudly occupying the new seat beside Fritz in the canoe, shared with\r\nhim the honor of leading the way in the character of pilots.\r\n\r\nWe passed safely through the rocks and shoals near Walrus Island into an\r\nexpanse of calm water, sheltered by jutting cliffs, where the sea\r\nglanced like a mirror, and for the first time we observed the fairy-like\r\nshells of the paper-nautilus sailing lightly over the dazzling surface.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to see these lovely seafarers without wishing to\r\nobtain specimens; and the canoe accordingly gave chase, presently\r\nsecuring half a dozen, which were handed to us in the yacht to be\r\ncarefully preserved for the museum, and the place was ever after called\r\nNautilus Creek.\r\n\r\nFurther on we rounded a short promontory, flat, with an abrupt rock at\r\nthe extremity, to which we gave the name of Cape Pug-Nose; and then, at\r\nsome distance, appeared the grand cliffs of a headland running far out\r\nto sea.\r\n\r\nThis I suppose we should have to weather, but my pilots made no change\r\nin our course, and, following the canoe, we soon came in sight of the\r\nmajestic archway which offered us a short passage to Pearl Bay.\r\n\r\nThe wonderfully architectural appearance of the pillars, arches, and\r\npinnacles, surrounding and surmounting this noble entrance, struck me\r\nwith admiration, resembling parts of a fine gothic cathedral, and\r\ninducing me to propose for it the name, Cape Minster.\r\n\r\nA perfect cloud of little swallows darted from the cavernous entrance on\r\nour approach, divided into flocks, soared, wheeled, flew right and left,\r\nand finally returned in a body as swiftly as they came, to the sides of\r\nthe long dark tunnel, which were festooned with their nests.\r\n\r\nWe detached a number of these as we passed, taking care to leave those\r\ncontaining eggs of young. The best were at a considerable height, but\r\nthe broken shelving rocks afforded, in some places, footing for such\r\ndaring and active climbers as Fritz and Jack, and they quickly obtained\r\nas many as we could possibly require.\r\n\r\nOur progress was much assisted by the tide, which, like a current, bore\r\nus onward along the nave of this natural cathedral; aisles, transepts,\r\nscreens, and side-chapels appearing between the columns and arches which\r\nin the "dim religious light" were revealed to our wondering eyes.\r\n\r\nOn emerging into the dazzling sunshine, we found ourselves floating in\r\nthe calm expanse of Pearl Bay; but it was some minutes before we could\r\nlook around on the bright and lovely scene.\r\n\r\nFritz had not over-rated its beauty, and the romantic islets which\r\nstudded its waters seemed to give the effect of a pleasant smile to\r\nfeatures already perfect.\r\n\r\nWe cruised about for some time, surveying the coast with its fertile\r\nmeadows, shady groves, gently swelling hills, and murmuring brooks,\r\nseeking a convenient landing place in the vicinity of the shallows where\r\nlay the oyster-beds.\r\n\r\nThis we found, close to a sparkling streamlet; and, as the day was fast\r\ndeclining, we made speedy arrangements for burning a watch-fire; after\r\nwhich we partook of a hasty supper, and leaving the dogs, with Coco, the\r\njackal, to sleep on shore, we returned on board the yacht for the night,\r\nanchoring within gunshot of the land.\r\n\r\nThe coast being quite strange to us, I knew not what wild beasts might\r\nfrequent it; but, though I did not fear that any would approach us by\r\nswimming, yet I was glad to have with us our lively little ape, Mercury\r\n(the successor of our old favorite, Knips, long since gathered to his\r\nfathers), for he occupied at night a cosy berth on deck, and was certain\r\nto give vociferous notice should anything alarming occur.\r\n\r\nFritz moored the cajack alongside, and came on board. The night passed\r\nin peace, although for a time we were disturbed by the yelping of\r\njackals, with whom Coco persisted in keeping up a noisy conversation.\r\n\r\nWe awoke it daybreak, and after breakfast _\xe0 la fourchette_, we repaired\r\nin haste with nets, scrapers, and all other requisites, to the\r\noyster-beds, where we worked with such diligence and success that in the\r\ncourse of two days we had an immense pile of shells built up like a\r\nstack on the beach, and left to decay.\r\n\r\nI collected a quantity of seaweed to spread over them, which was\r\nafterward burnt to make alkali, when we returned to secure our harvest\r\nof pearls.\r\n\r\nEvery evening we went out shooting in the neighborhood, and kept\r\nourselves supplied with game of one sort or another. The last day of our\r\nfishery we started earlier, intending to make a longer excursion into\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nErnest set off first with Floss; Jack and Coco strolling after them.\r\nFritz and I were still employed in taking on board the last load of our\r\ntools, when we suddenly heard a shot, a loud cry of pain or fear, and\r\nthen another shot.\r\n\r\nAt the first alarm, the other two dogs rushed away from us toward the\r\nspot, and Fritz, who had just called Pounce from his perch, to accompany\r\nus in the ramble, let him fly, and seizing his rifle darted off in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\nBefore I could reach the scene of action, more shots were heard, and\r\nthen a shout of victory; after which appeared through the stems of the\r\ntrees the disconsolate figure of Jack, hobbling along like a cripple,\r\nsupported on each side by his brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen they came near me they stopped; and poor Jack moaning and groaning,\r\nbegan to feel himself all over, as if to search for broken bones, crying\r\nout:\r\n\r\n"I\'m pounded like a half-crushed pepper-corn!"\r\n\r\nOn examination I found some severe bruises.\r\n\r\n"Who or what has been pommeling the boy?" I exclaimed; "one would think\r\nhe had been beaten."\r\n\r\n"It was a huge wild boar," said Ernest, "with fierce eyes, monstrous\r\ntusks, and a snout as broad as my hand."\r\n\r\nWe took Jack down to the yacht, bathed his bruises, gave him a cooling\r\ndrink, and he soon fell fast asleep in his berth, where I left him and\r\nreturned to the shore.\r\n\r\n"Now, Ernest," said I, "enlighten me on the subject of this adventure!\r\nWhat you and the boar did, is quite a mystery to me."\r\n\r\n"Floss and I were going quietly along," replied he, "when suddenly there\r\nwas a rustling and snorting close by, and a great boar broke through the\r\nbrushes, making for the outskirts of the wood. Floss gave chase\r\ndirectly, and the boar turned to bay. Then up came Jack with Coco, and\r\nthe gallant little jackal attacked the monster in the rear. In another\r\nmoment, however, he was sent sprawling upon his back, and this so\r\nprovoked his master that he fired a hasty ill-directed shot. The brute\'s\r\nnotice and fury at once turned upon Jack, who prudently took to his\r\nheels, when I attempted to check the career of the boar by a shot,\r\nwhich, however, only slightly wounded it. Jack stumbled and fell over\r\nthe root of a tree, just as the animal came up with him. \'Help! murder,\'\r\nshouted he; and if the other dogs had not then arrived, and all together\r\ntackled the boar, I fear it would have been a case of murder indeed! as\r\nit was, the poor fellow got mauled and trampled upon dreadfully.\r\n\r\n"As I was waiting for an opportunity to fire without any risk of hitting\r\nJack, Pounce rushed through the air and darted upon the beast, and\r\nFritz came up quickly and shot it dead with a pistol.\r\n\r\n"While we were helping Jack along, and passing a place where the boar\r\nhad been grubbing, I noticed some such curious knotty roots or\r\ntubercles, that I brought away specimens. Are they worth anything, do\r\nyou think? they have a strong smell."\r\n\r\n"If I may trust my nose," said I, "you have brought something by no\r\nmeans to be despised. Yes!" I continued, putting them to my lips, "these\r\nare very fine truffles! Taste them, Fritz."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, they are excellent," said he; "very different from the tough,\r\nleathery things I remember in Europe; these are tender and well\r\nflavored."\r\n\r\n"Because they are fresh," said I. "You have before tasted those only\r\nwhich have been brought from a distance. They are found in different\r\nparts of Europe, buried at a depth of ten or twelve inches in the soil\r\nof oak or beech woods. A small dog is employed to hunt for them, who\r\nperceives their musky odor in a singularly acute way, and at once\r\nscratches at the spot where they lie."\r\n\r\n"Have the truffles no leaves or stalks," inquired Fritz, "by which they\r\nmight be found without the help of the dog?"\r\n\r\n"They have nothing of the sort," I replied; "they are discovered simply\r\nby scent, and are considered to belong to the tribe of Fungi."\r\n\r\nBy this time it was late; we took supper, made up the watch-fire, and\r\nwithdrew to our yacht, where we slept peacefully.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning we proceeded to visit the field of battle. The wild\r\nboar, which I had not before seen, proved to be much larger and more\r\nformidable in appearance than I had imagined, and Jack\'s escape seemed\r\nto be perfectly marvelous.\r\n\r\nThe boys took it as a matter of course that we were to cut out hams and\r\nflitches; and we therefore did so, though I warned them that they need\r\nnot expect much pleasure in eating bacon from a tough old African boar\r\nlike this. We conveyed the mighty hams to the beach, each on a sledge of\r\nplaited boughs and twigs, and drawn by one of the dogs. The monstrous\r\nhead traveled in the same way, and we collected a large number of\r\ntruffles before quitting the forest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dogs were released, they rushed back to the scene of\r\noperations in the wood, comprehending that they were now free to feast\r\non what remained there.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to be done in consequence of this affair that Fritz,\r\nwho had hoped to set out on his solitary expedition that day, deferred\r\nit until the next; and was, therefore, fortunately with us, when late in\r\nthe evening we desisted from our labors, and, having supped, were\r\npreparing to retire to rest.\r\n\r\nAll at once a deep, fearful sound echoed through the neighboring woods.\r\nIt made our blood curdle in our veins. We listened with straining ears,\r\nhoping it would not be repeated. With a shudder we heard the dread voice\r\nroar again, yet nearer to us, and an answer peal from the distance.\r\n\r\n"We must find out who are the performers in this concert!" exclaimed\r\nFritz, springing to his feet and snatching up his rifle. "Make the fire\r\nblaze; get on board the yacht, and have all the guns in readiness. I am\r\noff to reconnoiter in the canoe."\r\n\r\nWe mechanically obeyed his rapid orders, while the bold youth\r\ndisappeared in the darkness; and, after heaping fuel on the fire, we\r\nwent on board and armed ourselves with cutlasses, besides loading all\r\nthe guns, waiting in readiness either to land again or to quit the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nWe presently saw the whole pack of our dogs, as well as Coco, the\r\njackal, and the little ape, Mercury (who had been tempted by the\r\ntruffles to stay with them in the woods), come galloping at full speed\r\nup to the fire.\r\n\r\nMercury was evidently excessively discomposed at finding us gone; he\r\ngnashed his teeth, and chattered, as though in fear, looking hopelessly\r\nat the water, through which he could not venture.\r\n\r\nThe dogs planted themselves by the fire, gazing fixedly landward, with\r\nears erect, and occasionally uttering a barking challenge, or a\r\nsuppressed howl.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the horrid roarings approached nearer, and I concluded that a\r\ncouple of leopards or panthers had been attracted by the scent of the\r\nboar\'s carcass.\r\n\r\nBut not long after I had expressed this opinion, we beheld a large,\r\npowerful animal spring from the underwood, and, with a bound, and\r\nmuttered roar, approach the fire. In a moment I recognized the\r\nunmistakable outlines of the form of a lion, though in size he far\r\nsurpassed any I had ever seen exhibited in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe dogs slunk behind the fire, and the lion seated himself almost like\r\na cat on his hind legs, glaring alternately at them, and at the great\r\nboar hams which hung near, with doubtless a mixed feeling of irritation\r\nand appetite, which was testified by the restless movement of his tail.\r\n\r\nHe then arose, and commenced walking up and down with a slow and\r\nmeasured pace, occasionally uttering short, angry roars, quite unlike\r\nthe prolonged, full tones we had heard at first.\r\n\r\nAt times he went to drink at the brook, always returning with such\r\nhaste, that I fully expected to see him spring.\r\n\r\nGradually his manner became more and more threatening; he turned toward\r\nus, crouched, and with his body at full stretch, waved his tail, and\r\nglared so furiously, that I was in doubt whether to fire, or retreat,\r\nwhen through the darkness rang the sharp crack of a rifle.\r\n\r\n"That is Fritz!" exclaimed every one; while, with a fearful roar, the\r\nlion sprang to his feet, stood stock still, tottered, sank on his knees,\r\nrolled over, and lay motionless on the sand.\r\n\r\n"We are saved!" I cried; "that was a masterly shot. The lion is struck\r\nto the heart; he will never stir again. Stay on board, boys. I must\r\njoin my brave Fritz."\r\n\r\nIn a few moments I landed; the dogs met me with evident tokens of\r\npleasure, but kept whining uneasily, and looking toward the deep\r\ndarkness of the woods whence the lion had come.\r\n\r\nThis behavior made me cautious; and, seeing nothing of Fritz, I lingered\r\nby the boat, when suddenly a lioness bounded from the shadow of the\r\ntrees, into the light diffused by the fire.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the blazing faggots she paused, as though startled; passed\r\nwith uncertain step round the outskirts of the illuminated circle; and\r\nuttered roarings, which were evidently calls to her mate, whose dead\r\nbody she presently discovered.\r\n\r\nFinding him motionless, her manner betokened the greatest concern; she\r\ntouched him with her fore-paws, smelt round him, and licked his bleeding\r\nwounds. Then, raising her head, she gnashed her teeth, and gave forth\r\nthe most lamentable and dreadful sound I ever heard; a mingled roar and\r\nhowl, which was like the expression of grief, rage, and a vow to be\r\nrevenged, all in one.\r\n\r\nCrack! Another shot: the creature\'s right forepaw was lamed; and the\r\ndogs, seeing me raise my gun, suddenly gathered courage, and ran forward\r\njust as I fired. My shot also wounded the lioness, but not mortally, and\r\nthe most terrific combat ensued.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to fire again, for fear of wounding the dogs. The\r\nscene was fearful beyond description. Black night surrounded us; the\r\nfitful blaze of the fire shed a strange, unnatural light on the\r\nprostrate body of the huge dead lion, and on the wounded lioness, who\r\nfought desperately against the attack of the four gallant dogs; while\r\nthe cries, roars, and groans of anguish and fury uttered by all the\r\nanimals were enough to try the stoutest nerves.\r\n\r\nOld Juno, staunch to the last, was foremost in the fray. After a time, I\r\nsaw her change her plan of attack, and spring at the throat of the\r\nlioness; who, in an instant, raised her left paw, and at one blow the\r\ncruel claws had laid open the body of the dog, and destroyed the life of\r\nthe true and faithful companion of so many years.\r\n\r\nJust then Fritz appeared. The lioness was much weakened, and we ventured\r\nto go near enough to fire with safety to ourselves; and finally I\r\ndispatched her by plunging a hunting-knife deep in her breast.\r\n\r\nErnest and Jack were summoned from the yacht to witness the completed\r\nvictory; and I regretted having left them on board, when I saw how\r\ngreatly the noise and tumult had alarmed them, unable, as they were, to\r\nascertain what was going on.\r\n\r\nThey hastened toward us in great agitation, and their joy on seeing us\r\nsafe was only equaled by the grief they felt on learning the death of\r\nJuno.\r\n\r\nThe night was now far advanced; the fire burnt low; but we piled on more\r\nwood, and, by the renewed light, drew poor Juno from between the paws of\r\nthe lioness; and by the brookside, washed and bound up the torn body,\r\nwrapped it carefully in canvas, and carrying it with us on board the\r\nyacht, that it might be buried at Rockburg, whither on the following day\r\nit was our purpose to return.\r\n\r\nWearied and sorrowful, but full of thankfulness for our personal safety,\r\nwe at length lay down to sleep, having brought all the dogs on board.\r\n\r\nNext morning, before quitting Pearl Bay, we once more landed, that we\r\nmight possess ourselves of the magnificent skins of the lion and\r\nlioness, whose visit, fatal to themselves, had caused such a commotion\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nIn about a couple of hours we returned to the yacht, leaving the flayed\r\ncarcasses to the tender mercies of the birds of prey sure to be\r\nattracted to them.\r\n\r\n"Homeward bound," sang out the boys, as they cheerily weighed anchor,\r\nand prepared to stand out to sea. I could see, though he did not\r\ncomplain, that poor Jack had not recovered from the boar\'s rough\r\ntreatment, and moved very stiffly.\r\n\r\n"You must pilot us through the channel in the reef this time, Fritz,"\r\nsaid I; adding, in a lower tone, "and then is it to be \'farewell,\' my\r\nson!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear father--_Au revoir_!" returned he, brightly, with a glance\r\nfull of meaning, while he threw into his canoe a cushion and a fur\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Fritz! but I\'m going to honor them with the care of my battered\r\nbones in the yacht here. You are awfully considerate though, old\r\nfellow," remarked Jack, not for a moment doubting that his brother\r\nexpected him to return, as he came, beside him in the cajack.\r\n\r\nFritz laughed, and commended his decision. Then springing into his\r\nskiff, he led the way toward the open sea.\r\n\r\nWe followed, carefully, and soon passed the reef; after which the boys\r\nwere very busy with the sails, putting the vessel on the homeward\r\ncourse, when, waving his hand to me, Fritz turned in the opposite\r\ndirection, and quickly vanished behind the point, which I afterward\r\nnamed Cape Farewell.\r\n\r\nWhen missed by his brothers, I said he had a fancy to explore more of\r\nthe coast, and if he found it interesting he might, instead of only a\r\nfew hours, remain absent for two or three days.\r\n\r\nToward evening, we sailed into Safety Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n Juno\'s epitaph--Fritz does not appear--We start in search of him--A\r\n     cachalot whale--The unexpected appearance of a savage--Fritz in a\r\n     dusky disguise--He leads us to Fair Isle, and shows us the wonders\r\n     therein--The stranger--Fritz narrates his adventures--How he saw\r\n     Toucans--Encountered a tiger--Lost Pounce--Found the Smoking Rock,\r\n     and Jenny Montrose--The history of the stranger--Wolves dispute\r\n     our right to the whale--Coco joins his brethren--Jack and Jenny\r\n     search for the truant--We leave Pearl Bay--A hearty reception--A\r\n     visit to Falconhurst--Jack displays our stud--The rainy season\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother and Franz, though somewhat startled by the unexpected absence\r\nof Fritz, were delighted to see us return safely, and listened with\r\neager interest to our adventures. My wife shuddered, and scarcely\r\nsuppressed an involuntary scream as she heard of our desperate encounter\r\nwith the lion and his mate. Jack\'s danger and providential escape, too,\r\nmade her tremble; and so pale did he still look, that she could scarcely\r\nbelieve he was uninjured.\r\n\r\nTears came into Franz\'s eyes when he heard of the sad death of poor old\r\nJuno; and he inquired most tenderly whether her remains had been brought\r\nback, that they might be interred near the house which had been her home\r\nfor so many years.\r\n\r\nNext day he saw her buried carefully; and Ernest, at his request,\r\nproduced an epitaph, which was inscribed upon a slab of stone above her\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n                    JUNO,\r\n            A servant true lies here;\r\n                A faithful friend,\r\n                    A Dog,\r\n                To all most dear;\r\n                Who met her end\r\n    Fighting right bravely in her master\'s cause.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the wild boar and the truffles were handed over to the\r\nmother, who received them with delight, promising us therefrom many a\r\nsavory dish. She would fain have had the boar\'s head too; but my word\r\nwas pledged to Ernest that it should adorn his museum, and, though my\r\nlips watered to taste it baked in Hottentot fashion, I would not break\r\nmy promise.\r\n\r\nThis splendid head, therefore, together with the lions\' skins, we\r\ncarried to the tannery on Whale Island, where they were cleaned and\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nFive days passed, but Fritz still remained absent. I could not conceal\r\nmy anxiety, and at length determined to follow him. All were delighted\r\nat the proposal, and even the mother, when she heard that we were to\r\nsail in the pinnace, agreed to accompany us.\r\n\r\nThe boat was stored, and on a bright morning, with a favorable breeze,\r\nwe five, with the dogs, stepped aboard, and ran for Cape Minster.\r\n\r\nOur beautiful little yacht bounded over the water gaily, and the bright\r\nsunshine and delicious sea breeze put us all in the highest spirits. The\r\nentrance of the archway was in sight, and thither I was directing the\r\nboat\'s course. Suddenly, right ahead, I saw a dark and shadowy mass just\r\nbelow the surface of the water. "A sunken rock!" I thought to myself,\r\n"and yet it is strange that I never before noticed it." I put down the\r\nhelm in a moment, but a catastrophe seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\nWe surged ahead! A slight shock, and all was over! The danger was\r\npassed!\r\n\r\nI glanced astern, to look again at the dangerous spot; but the rock was\r\ngone, and, where but a moment before I had distinctly seen its great\r\ngreen shadow, I could now see nothing. Before we had recovered from our\r\namazement, a shout from Jack surprised me.\r\n\r\n"There is another," he exclaimed, "to starboard, father!"\r\n\r\nSure enough, there lay, apparently, another sunken rock.\r\n\r\n"The rock is moving!" shouted Franz; and a great black body emerged from\r\nthe sea, while from the upper extremity rushed a column of water, which,\r\nwith a mighty noise, rose upward, and then fell like rain all around.\r\nThe mystery was explained; for, as the great beast emerged yet further\r\nfrom the water, I recognized, from its enormous size and great length of\r\nhead, the cachalot whale.\r\n\r\nThe monster was apparently enraged at the way we had scratched his back;\r\nfor, retreating to a short distance, he evidently meditated a rush upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nFearful stories occurred to me of the savage temper of this whale, how\r\nhe has been known to destroy boat after boat, and even ships, and with a\r\nfeeling of desperation I sprang to one of the guns. Jack leaped to the\r\nother, and almost simultaneously we fired. Both shots apparently took\r\neffect; for the whale, after lashing the water violently for a few\r\nseconds, plunged beneath its surface, and disappeared. We kept a sharp\r\nlookout for him, for I was unwilling to lose such a valuable prize, and,\r\nreloading, stood toward the shore, in which direction he was apparently\r\nmaking. Presently we again sighted him in shallow water, lashing\r\nfearfully with his tail, and dyeing the waves around him with blood.\r\nApproaching the infuriate animal as nearly as I dared, we again fired.\r\n\r\nThe struggles of the whale seemed for a few moments to become even yet\r\nmore frantic, and then, with a quiver from head to tail, he lay\r\nmotionless--dead!\r\n\r\nThe boys were about to raise the cry of victory, but checked the shout\r\nupon their very lips; for darting behind a rock they espied a canoe\r\npaddled by a tall and muscular savage, who now stood up in his skiff and\r\nappeared to be examining us attentively. Seeing that we were standing\r\ntoward him, the swarthy native seized his paddle and again darted behind\r\na rock. An awful thought now took possession of me. There must be a\r\ntribe of blacks lurking on these shores, and Fritz must have fallen into\r\ntheir hands. We, however, I determined should not be easily taken; and\r\nour guns were loaded and run out.\r\n\r\nPresently a dusky face appeared, peeping at us from a lofty rock; it\r\nvanished, and we saw another peeping at us from lower down. Then, again,\r\nthe skiff put out as though to make a further reconnoiter. All, even\r\nJack, looked anxious, and glanced at me for orders.\r\n\r\n"Hoist a white flag," said I, "and hand me the speaking-trumpet."\r\n\r\nI seized the instrument and uttered such peaceable words in the Malay\r\nlanguage as I could recall; neither the flag nor my words seemed to\r\nproduce any effect, and the savage was about to return to the shore.\r\n\r\nJack hereupon lost patience, and in his turn took up the trumpet.\r\n\r\n"Come here, you black son of a gun," he exclaimed. "Come on board and\r\nmake friends, or we\'ll blow you and your----"\r\n\r\n"Stop! stop! you foolish boy," I said; "you will but alarm the man, with\r\nyour wild words and gestures."\r\n\r\n"No! but, see," he cried, "he is paddling toward us!"\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough the canoe was rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\nPresently a cry from Franz alarmed me. "Look! look!" he shrieked, "the\r\nvillain is in Fritz\'s cajack. I can see the walrus\' head."\r\n\r\nErnest alone remained unmoved. He took the speaking-trumpet:\r\n\r\n"Fritz, ahoy!" he shouted; "welcome, old fellow!"\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth when I, too, recognized the\r\nwell-known face beneath its dusky disguise.\r\n\r\nIn another minute the brave boy was on board, and in spite of his\r\nblackened face was kissed and welcomed heartily. He was now assailed\r\nwith a storm of questions from all sides: "Where had he been?" "What had\r\nkept him so long, and why had he turned blackamoor?"\r\n\r\n"The last question," replied he, with a smile, "is the only one I will\r\nnow answer; the others shall be explained when I give a full account of\r\nmy adventures. Hearing guns fired, my mind was instantly filled with\r\nideas of Malay pirates, for I never dreamed that you could be here in\r\nthe yacht, so I disguised myself as you now see me, and came forth to\r\nreconnoiter. When you addressed me in Malay you only added to my terror,\r\nfor it left not a doubt in my mind that you were pirates."\r\n\r\nHaving in our turn described to him our adventure with the cachalot\r\nwhale, I asked him if he knew of a suitable spot for the anchorage of\r\nthe yacht.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he replied, casting toward me a glance full of meaning; "I\r\ncan lead you to an island where there is a splendid anchorage, and which\r\nis itself well worth seeing, for it contains all sorts of strange\r\nthings." And after removing the stains from his skin, and turning\r\nhimself once more into a civilized being, he again sprang into his canoe\r\nand piloted us to a picturesque little island in the bay.\r\n\r\nNow that there could be no doubt as to the success of Fritz\'s\r\nexpedition, I no longer hesitated to give to my wife an account of his\r\nproject, and to prepare her mind for the surprise which awaited her. She\r\nwas greatly startled, as I expected, and seemed almost overcome with\r\nemotion at the idea of seeing a human being, and that being one of her\r\nown sex.\r\n\r\n"But why," she asked, "did you not tell me of this at first? Why wait\r\nuntil the last moment with such joyful news?"\r\n\r\n"I was unwilling," I replied, "to raise hopes which might never be\r\nrealized: but now, thank Heaven, he has succeeded, and there is no need\r\nfor concealment."\r\n\r\nThe boys could not at all understand the evident air of mystery and\r\nsuppressed excitement which neither their mother, Fritz, nor I could\r\nentirely conceal. They cast glances of the greatest curiosity toward the\r\nisland, and as soon as the sails were furled and the anchor dropped,\r\nthey sprang eagerly ashore. In a body we followed Fritz, maintaining\r\nperfect silence. Presently we emerged from the thicket through which we\r\nwere passing, and saw before us a hut of sheltering boughs, at the\r\nentrance of which burned a cheerful fire.\r\n\r\nInto this leafy bower Fritz dived, leaving his brothers without, mute\r\nwith astonishment. In another moment he emerged, leading by the hand a\r\nslight, handsome youth, by his dress apparently a young English naval\r\nofficer. The pair advanced to meet us; and Fritz, with a countenance\r\nradiant with joy, briefly introduced his companion as Edward Montrose.\r\n\r\n"And," he continued, looking at his mother and me, "will you not welcome\r\nhim as a friend and a brother to our family circle?"\r\n\r\n"That will we, indeed!" I exclaimed, advancing and holding out my hands\r\nto the fair young stranger. "Our wild life may have roughened our looks\r\nand manners, but it has not hardened our hearts, I trust."\r\n\r\nThe mother, too, embraced the seeming youth most heartily. The lads, and\r\neven the dogs, were not behind hand in testifying their gratification at\r\nthe appearance of their new friend--the former delighted at the idea of\r\na fresh companion, and the latter won by her sweet voice and appearance.\r\n\r\nFrom the expression made use of by Fritz I perceived that the girl\r\nwished her sex to remain unrevealed to the rest of the party until the\r\nmother could obtain for her a costume more suited to her real character.\r\n\r\nThe young men then ran down to the yacht to bring up what was necessary\r\nfor supper, as well as to make preparations for a camp in which we might\r\nspend the night. This done the mother hastened to set before us a\r\nsubstantial meal, while the boys, anxious to make their new acquaintance\r\nfeel at home among them, were doing their best to amuse her. She\r\nherself, after the first feeling of strangeness had worn off, entered\r\nfully into all their fun; and by the time they sat down to supper was\r\nlaughing and chattering as gaily as any one of the rest. She admired the\r\nvarious dishes, tasted our mead, and, without alluding once to her\r\nprevious life, kept up a lively conversation.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact of meeting with any human being after so many years of\r\nisolation was in itself sufficient to raise the boys to the greatest\r\nstate of excitement; but that this being should be one so handsome, so\r\ngay, so perfectly charming, seemed completely to have turned their\r\nheads; and when I gave the sign for breaking up of the feast, and their\r\nnew friend was about to be led to the night quarters which had been\r\nprepared for her on board the yacht, the health of Edward Montrose was\r\nproposed, and drank in fragrant mead, amid the cheers and acclamations\r\nof all hands.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, and silence had been restored, Jack exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Now, then, Fritz, if you please, just tell me where you came across\r\nthis jolly fellow. Did you take your mysterious voyage in search of him,\r\nor did you meet him by chance? Out with your adventures, while we sit\r\ncomfortably round the fire."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Jack cast more wood upon the blazing pile, and throwing\r\nhimself down in his usual, careless fashion, prepared to listen\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\nFritz, after a few moments\' hesitation, began:\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you remember," said he, "how, when I returned from my\r\nexpedition in the cajack the other day, I struck down an albatross. None\r\nbut my father at the time knew, however, what became of the wounded\r\nbird, or even thought more about it. Yet it was that albatross who\r\nbrought me notice of the shipwrecked stranger and he, too, I determined\r\nshould carry back a message, to cheer and encourage the sender.\r\n\r\n"I first, as you know, prepared my cajack to carry two persons; and\r\nthen, with a heart full of hope and trust, left you and the yacht, and,\r\nwith Pounce seated before me, made for the open sea. For several hours I\r\npaddled steadily on, till, the wind freshening, I thought it advisable\r\nto keep in nearer shore; that, should a regular storm arise, I might\r\nfind some sheltered bay in which to weather it.\r\n\r\n"It was well I did so; for, scarcely had I reached a quiet cove which\r\npromised to afford me the protection I desired than the sea appeared one\r\nmass of foam: great surging waves arose; and even in the comparative\r\ncalm of the bay I felt that I was in some danger.\r\n\r\n"I passed the night in my cajack; and next morning, after a frugal meal\r\nof pemmican, and a draught of water from my flask, once more ventured\r\nforth. The wind had subsided, and the sea was tolerably smooth; and,\r\nkeeping my eyes busily employed in seeking in every direction to detect,\r\nif possible, the slightest trace of smoke, or other sign of human life,\r\nI paddled on till noon.\r\n\r\n"The aspect of the coast now began to change: the shores were sandy,\r\nwhile further inland lay dense forests, from whose gloomy depths I could\r\never and anon hear the fierce roar of beasts of prey, the yell of apes,\r\nthe fiendish laugh of the hyena, or the despairing death cry of a\r\nhapless deer. Seldom have I experienced a greater feeling of solitude\r\nthan while listening to these strange sounds, and knowing that I, in\r\nthis frail canoe, was the only human being near. Giving myself up to\r\ncontemplation, I rested my paddle, and allowed my cajack to drift slowly\r\non.\r\n\r\n"As I neared the shore, I noticed a large number of stranger looking\r\nbirds, who would sometimes flutter round me, and then dart back again to\r\nthe border of the forest, where they were feeding on what appeared to be\r\nthe pepper plant; they seized the berries in their great, ponderous\r\nbeaks, threw them up into the air, and then dexterously caught them in\r\ntheir fall. Their beaks were really something extraordinary: they looked\r\nas though they must give their owners a perpetual headache, from their\r\nimmense weight. The only thing that relieved the extreme ugliness of\r\nthese great appendages was their gorgeous color, which was only rivaled\r\nby the gay hue of the plumage. I wished now that I had brought home a\r\nspecimen; but at the time I was so much amused by watching the grotesque\r\nantics of the birds that I did not think of obtaining one. When I left\r\nthe spot, I settled in my own mind that they were toucans: was I right,\r\nErnest?"\r\n\r\nThe Professor, unwilling to interrupt the narrative, merely gave an\r\noracular nod, and Fritz continued:\r\n\r\n"For some hours after this I paddled quickly on, sometimes passing the\r\nmouth of a stream, sometimes that of a broad river. Had I been merely on\r\nan exploring expedition, I should have been tempted, doubtless, to\r\ncruise a little way up one of these pathways into the forest; but now\r\nsuch an idea did not enter my head. On, on, on, I felt I must go, until\r\nI should reach the goal of my voyage.\r\n\r\n"The shades of night at length drew on, and, finding a sheltered cove, I\r\nmoored my cajack, and stepped on shore. You may imagine how pleasant it\r\nwas to stretch my legs, after sitting for so long in the cramped\r\nposition which my cajack enforces. It would not do, however, to sleep on\r\nshore; so after preparing and enjoying my supper, I returned on board,\r\nand there spent the night.\r\n\r\n"Next morning Pounce and I again landed for breakfast. I lit my fire,\r\nand hung before it a plump young parrot to roast. As I was so doing, I\r\nheard a slight rustle among the long grass behind me. I glanced round,\r\nand there, with glaring eyes and his great tail swaying to and fro, I\r\nsaw an immense tiger.\r\n\r\n"In another moment his spring would have been made. I should have been\r\nno more, and our young guest would have been doomed to, God only knows\r\nhow many, years of frightful solitude!\r\n\r\n"My gun was lying by my side. Before I could have stooped to pick it up,\r\nthe monster would have seized me.\r\n\r\n"Pounce saw and comprehended my danger: the heroic bird darted upon my\r\nenemy, and so blinded him with his flapping wings, and the fierce blows\r\nof his beak, that his spring was checked, and I had time to recover my\r\nself-possession. I seized my gun, and fired; and the brute, pierced to\r\nthe heart, gave one spring, and then rolled over at my feet.\r\n\r\n"My enemy was dead; but beside him, alas! lay poor Pounce, crushed and\r\nlifeless. One blow of the great beast\'s paw had struck him down, never\r\nto rise again!"\r\n\r\nFritz\'s voice shook as he came to this point; and, after remaining\r\nsilent for a moment or two, he continued hurriedly:\r\n\r\n"With a sad and desolate feeling at my heart, I buried the faithful bird\r\nwhere he had met his death; and then, unable longer to continue near the\r\nspot, I returned to my cajack, and leaving the great tiger lying where\r\nhe fell, paddled hastily away.\r\n\r\n"My thoughts were gloomy. I felt as though, now that my companion was\r\ngone, I could no longer continue the voyage. The albatross, I thought,\r\nmay have flown for hundreds of miles before it reached me. This stranger\r\nmay be on different shores from these entirely; every stroke of my\r\npaddle may be carrying me further from the blazing signal: who knows?\r\n\r\n"This feeling of discouragement was not, however, to be of long\r\nduration; for in a moment more a sight presented itself, which banished\r\nall my doubts and fears, and raised me to the highest pitch of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"A high point of land lay before me. I rounded it, and beyond found a\r\ncalm and pleasant bay, from whose curved and thickly wooded shores ran\r\nout a reef of rocks. From the point of this reef rose a column of smoke,\r\nsteadily and clearly curling upward in the calm air. I could scarcely\r\nbelieve my senses, but stopped gazing at it, as though I were in a\r\ndream; then, with throbbing pulse and giddy brain, I seized my paddle,\r\nand strained every nerve to reach it.\r\n\r\n"A few strokes seemed to carry me across the bay, and, securing my\r\ncanoe, I leaped upon the rock, on which the beacon was blazing, but not\r\na sign of a human being could I see. I was about to shout, for as the\r\nfire had evidently been recently piled up, I knew the stranger could not\r\nbe far off; but, before I could do so, I saw a slight figure passing\r\nalong the chain of rocks toward the spot on which I stood. You may all\r\nimagine my sensations.\r\n\r\n"I advanced a few paces; and then mastering my emotion as best I could,\r\nI said in English:\r\n\r\n"\'Welcome, fair stranger! God, in his mercy, has heard your call, and\r\nhas sent me to your aid!\'\r\n\r\n"Miss Montrose came quickly forward----"\r\n\r\n"Who? What?" shouted the boys, interrupting the narrative; "who came\r\nforward?" and amid a general hubbub, Ernest, rising and advancing to his\r\nbrother, said in his quiet way:\r\n\r\n"I did not like to make any remark till you actually let out the secret,\r\nFritz, but we need no longer pretend not to see through the disguise of\r\nEdward Montrose."\r\n\r\nFritz, though much disconcerted by the discovery of the secret,\r\nrecovered his self-possession; and, after bearing with perfect\r\nequanimity the jokes with which his brothers assailed him, joined in\r\nthree cheers for their new sister, and when the confusion and laughter\r\nwhich ensued had subsided, continued his story:\r\n\r\n"Miss Montrose grasped my hands warmly, and guessing from my\r\npronunciation, I am afraid, that I was not in the habit of speaking\r\nEnglish every day of my life, said in French:\r\n\r\n"\'Long, long, have I waited since the bird returned with your message.\r\nThank God, you have come at last!\'\r\n\r\n"Then, with tears of joy and gratitude, she led me to the shore, where\r\nshe had built a hut and a safe sleeping-place, like Falconhurst on a\r\nsmall scale, among the branches of a tree. I was delighted with all she\r\nshowed me, for indeed her hut and its fittings evinced no ordinary skill\r\nand ingenuity. Round the walls hung bows, arrows, lances, and\r\nbird-snares; while on her work-table, in boxes and cases, carved\r\nskillfully with a knife, were fish-hooks of mother-of-pearl, needles\r\nmade from fish-bones, and bodkins from the beaks of birds, fishing-lines\r\nof all sorts, and knives and other tools. These latter she told me\r\nwere, with a chest of wearing apparel, almost the only things washed\r\nashore after the wreck, when three years ago she was cast alone upon\r\nthis desolate coast. I marveled more and more at the wonderful way in\r\nwhich this girl had surmounted obstacles, the quarter of which would\r\ncompletely have appalled the generality of her sex. The hut itself was a\r\nmarvel of skill; stout posts had been driven into the ground, with cross\r\npieces of bamboo, to form a framework; the walls had been woven with\r\nreeds, the roof thatched with palm-leaves, and the whole plastered\r\nsmoothly with clay, an open space being left in the center of the roof\r\nfor a chimney to carry off the smoke of the fire.\r\n\r\n"As we entered, a cormorant, with a cry of anger, flew from under the\r\ntable toward me, and was about to attack me fiercely. Miss Montrose\r\ncalled it off, and she then told me she had captured and tamed the bird\r\nsoon after first landing, and since that time had contrived to train it\r\nto assist her in every conceivable way; it now not only was a pleasant\r\ncompanion, but brought her food of every description, fish, flesh and\r\nfowl, for whether it dived into the waters, according to its natural\r\nhabit, struck down birds upon the wing, or seized rabbits and other\r\nsmall animals upon the land, it laid all its booty at her feet.\r\n\r\n"Before darkness closed in, all the curiosities and ingenious\r\ncontrivances of the place had been displayed--the kitchen stove, cooking\r\nutensils, skin bottles, shell plates and spoons, the fishing raft and\r\nnumberless other things--and then, sitting down with my fair hostess to\r\na most appetizing meal, she gave me a short account of her life:\r\n\r\n"Jenny Montrose was the daughter of a British officer, who had served\r\nfor many years in India, where she herself was born. At the early age of\r\nthree years she lost her mother.\r\n\r\n"After the death of his wife, all the colonel\'s love and care was\r\ncentered upon his only child; under his eye she was instructed in all\r\nthe accomplishments suited to her sex; and from him she imbibed an\r\nardent love of field sports. By the time she was seventeen, she was as\r\nmuch at home upon her horse in the field as in her father\'s drawing\r\nroom. Colonel Montrose now received orders to return home with his\r\nregiment, and as for certain reasons he did not wish her to accompany\r\nhim in the ship with the troops, he obtained a passage for her on board\r\na vessel which was about to sail at the same time.\r\n\r\n"The separation was extremely painful to both the old soldier and his\r\ndaughter, but there was no alternative. They parted, and Miss Montrose\r\nsailed in the _Dorcas_ for England. A week after she had left Calcutta,\r\na storm arose and drove the vessel far out of her course; more bad\r\nweather ensued; and at length, leaks having been sprung in all\r\ndirections, the crew were obliged to take to the boats. Jenny obtained a\r\nplace in one of the largest of these. After enduring the perils of the\r\nsea for many days, land was sighted; and, the other boats having\r\ndisappeared, an attempt was made to land. The boat was capsized, and\r\nMiss Montrose alone reached the shore. For a long time she lay upon the\r\nsand almost inanimate; but, reviving sufficiently to move, she at length\r\nobtained some shell-fish, and by degrees recovered her strength. From\r\nthat time forth until I appeared she never set eyes upon a human being.\r\nTo attract any passing vessel, and obtain assistance, however, she kept\r\na beacon continually blazing at the end of the reef; and, with the same\r\npurpose in view, attached missives to the feet of any birds she could\r\ntake alive in her snares. The albatross, she told me, she had kept for\r\nsome time, and partially tamed; but, as it was in the habit of making\r\nlong excursions on its own account, she conceived the idea of sending it\r\nalso with a message, that should it by chance be seen and taken alive,\r\nit might return with an answer.\r\n\r\n"Our supper was over, and, at length, both wearied out with the\r\nanxieties and excitement of the day, we retired to rest, she to her\r\nleafy bower, and I to sleep in the hut below.\r\n\r\n"Next morning, having packed her belongings in the cajack, we both went\r\non board; and bidding adieu to her well-known bay she took her seat\r\nbefore me, and I made for home.\r\n\r\n"We should have reached Rockburg this evening had not an accident\r\noccurred to our skiff and compelled us to put in at this island. The\r\nboat was scarcely repaired when I heard your first shots. I instantly\r\ndisguised myself; and, never doubting that Malay pirates were near, came\r\nforth to reconnoiter. Glad, indeed, I was to find my fears ungrounded."\r\n\r\nAll had listened attentively to Fritz\'s story, but now a dreadful yawn\r\nfrom Franz, followed by others from Jack, Ernest, and Fritz, and a great\r\ndesire on my own part to follow their example, warned me that it was\r\ntime to dismiss the party for the night. Fritz retired to his cajack,\r\nthe boys and I to the deck of the yacht, and the remainder of the night\r\npassed quietly away.\r\n\r\nNext morning, as we assembled for breakfast, I took the opportunity of\r\nbegging Miss Montrose no longer to attempt to continue her disguise, but\r\nto allow us to address her in her real character.\r\n\r\nJenny smiled; for she had noticed, as the young men met her when she\r\ncame from the cabin, a great alteration in their manner, and had at once\r\nseen that her secret was guessed.\r\n\r\n"After all," she said, "I need not be ashamed of this attire; it has\r\nbeen my only costume for the last three years, and in any other I should\r\nhave been unable to manage all the work which during that time has been\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\nOur pleasant meal over, I prepared to start for home, but Fritz reminded\r\nme of the cachalot, and although he confessed he should not care to\r\nrepeat the operation of cutting up a whale, he thought it would be a\r\npity to lose such a chance of obtaining a supply of spermaceti.\r\n\r\nI fully agreed with him; and embarking, we quickly reached the sandbank\r\non which the monster lay. No sooner did we come near, than the dogs\r\nleaped ashore, and before we could follow, rushed round to the other\r\nside of the great beast; snarling, growling, and howling ensued, and\r\nwhen we reached the spot we found a terrific combat going on. A troop of\r\nwolves were disputing fiercely with the dogs their right to the prey.\r\nOur appearance, however, quickly settled the matter; two of the brutes\r\nalready lay dead, and those that now escaped our guns galloped off.\r\nAmong the pack were a few jackals, and no sooner did Coco catch sight of\r\nthese, his relations, than, suddenly attracted by his instinct, he left\r\nhis master\'s side, and in spite of our shouts and cries, joined them,\r\nand disappeared into the forest.\r\n\r\nAs it would have been useless and dangerous to attempt to follow the\r\ndeserter into the woods, we left him alone, trusting that he would\r\nreturn before we again embarked. Fritz then climbed up the mountain of\r\nflesh, and with his hatchet quickly laid open the huge skull; Jack and\r\nFranz joined him,--Ernest having remained on the island, where we had\r\nleft the mother and Jenny,--and with buckets assisted him to bail out\r\nthe spermaceti. The few vessels we possessed were soon full, and having\r\nstored them in the yacht, we once more embarked and arrived at the\r\nlittle island shortly before the dinner hour.\r\n\r\nA capital meal had been prepared for us, and, when we had made ourselves\r\npresentable, we sat down to it, and related our adventures. The account\r\nof Coco\'s desertion was received with exclamations of surprise and\r\nsorrow. "Yet," said Jenny, after a time, "I do not think you should\r\ndespair of his recovery, for animals in their native state seldom care\r\nto allow those that have been once domesticated to consort with them. My\r\npoor albatross even, though he was never thoroughly tamed, and certainly\r\ndid finally desert me, yet used to return at intervals; and I am pretty\r\nsure that were you, Jack, to search the wood early to-morrow morning,\r\nyou would find your pet only too willing to come back to civilized\r\nlife; or, if you like, I will go myself and find him, for I should\r\nimmensely like to have a paddle in the cajack all by myself."\r\n\r\nJack was delighted at the former suggestion, and though he would not\r\nlisten for a moment to Jenny\'s request to be allowed to go alone, he\r\nagreed, if she cared for the fun of an early cruise, to accompany her in\r\nthe canoe next morning, and to return to the yacht in time to start for\r\nRockburg.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise they were off, armed with "bait" in the shape of meat and\r\nbiscuit, and a muzzle and chain which Jack had manufactured in the\r\nevening to punish the runagate for his offenses, should they catch him.\r\nArrived at the sandbank, they landed; and, after entering the forest and\r\nshouting "Coco, Coco!" till the woods rang again, they presently espied\r\nthe truant, slouching disconsolately toward them, looking very miserable\r\nand heartily ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nWith torn ears, and coat ruffled and dirty, he sneaked up. There was no\r\nneed to use the bait to entice him; and when the poor beast thus came,\r\nunhappy and begging forgiveness, Jack had not the heart to degrade him\r\nfurther with the muzzle and chain. He had evidently attempted to join\r\nhis wild brethren, and by them had been scouted, worried, and hustled,\r\nas no true jackal; and, as Jenny had foretold, was now only too glad to\r\nreturn to bondage and to comfort.\r\n\r\nPoor Coco had recovered his spirits slightly by the time the yacht was\r\nreached; and, after a hearty meal, again took his place among the dogs,\r\nwhom I had little doubt he would never again desert.\r\n\r\nAll was now bustle and activity; and breakfast over, we went aboard the\r\nyacht. Fritz and Jack stepped into the canoe; and we soon left Fair Isle\r\nand Pearl Bay far behind.\r\n\r\nThe morning was delightful. The sea, excepting for the slight ripple\r\nraised by the gentle breeze wafting us homeward, was perfectly calm.\r\nSlowly and contentedly we glided on through the wonders of the splendid\r\narchway, threaded our passage among the rocks and shoals, and passed out\r\nto the open sea. So slowly did we make our way, that the occupants of\r\nthe cajack announced that they could not wait for us when they had once\r\npiloted us out from among the shoals and reefs, and plied their paddles\r\nto such good purpose that they were soon out of sight. Nautilus Bay and\r\nCape Pug-Nose were in due time passed, however, and Shark Island hove in\r\nsight. With great astonishment Jenny gazed at our watch tower, with its\r\nguard-house, the fierce-looking guns, and the waving flag upon the\r\nheights. We landed, that she might visit the fortification; when we\r\ndisplayed all our arrangements with great pride. When they and the herd\r\nof lovely gazelles had been sufficiently admired, we again embarked, and\r\nsteered toward Deliverance Bay. On reaching the entrance, a grand salute\r\nof twelve shots welcomed us and our fair guest to Rockburg. Not pleased\r\nwith the even number, however, Ernest insisted upon replying with\r\nthirteen guns, an odd number being, he declared, absolutely necessary\r\nfor form\'s sake.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the quay, Fritz and Jack stood ready to receive us, and\r\nwith true politeness handed their mother and Jenny ashore. They turned\r\nand led the way to the house through the gardens, orchards, and\r\nshrubberies which lay on the rising ground that sloped gently upward to\r\nour dwelling.\r\n\r\nJenny\'s surprise was changed to wonder as she neared the villa\r\nitself--its broad, shady balcony, its fountains sparkling in the sun,\r\nthe dovecots, the pigeons wheeling above, and the bright, fresh creepers\r\ntwined round the columns, delighted her. She could scarcely believe that\r\nshe was still far from any civilized nation, and that she was among a\r\nfamily wrecked like herself upon a lonely coast.\r\n\r\nMy amazement, however, fully equaled that of my little daughter when,\r\nbeneath the shade of the veranda, I saw a table laid out with a\r\ndelicious luncheon. All our china, silver, and glass had been called\r\ninto requisition, and was arranged upon the spotless damask cloth.\r\n\r\nWine sparkled in the decanters, splendid pine-apples, oranges, guavas,\r\napples, and pears resting on cool green leaves, lay heaped in pyramids\r\nupon the porcelain dishes. A haunch of venison, cold fowl, hams, and\r\ntongues occupied the ends and sides of the table, while in the center\r\nrose a vase of gay flowers, surrounded by bowls of milk and great jugs\r\nof mead. It was, indeed, a perfect feast, and the heartiness of the\r\nwelcome brought tears of joy into the lovely eyes of the fair girl in\r\nwhose honor it had been devised.\r\n\r\nAll were soon ready to sit down; and Jenny, looking prettier than ever\r\nin the dress for which she had exchanged her sailor\'s suit, took the\r\nplace of honor between the mother and me. Ernest and Franz also seated\r\nthemselves; but nothing would induce Fritz and Jack to follow their\r\nexample. They considered themselves our entertainers, and waited upon us\r\nmost attentively, carving the joints, filling our glasses, and changing\r\nthe plates; for, as Jack declared to Miss Montrose, the servants had all\r\nrun away in our absence, and, for the next day or two, perhaps we should\r\nbe obliged to wait upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the banquet was over, and the waiters had satisfied their\r\nappetites, they joined their brothers, and with them displayed all the\r\nwonders of Rockburg to their new sister. To the house, cave, stables,\r\ngardens, fields and boathouses, to one after the other did they lead\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNot a corner would they have left unnoticed, had not the mother, fearing\r\nthey would tire the poor girl out, come to the rescue, and led her back\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, after an early breakfast, we started, while it was\r\nyet cool, for Falconhurst; and as I knew that repairs and arrangements\r\nfor the coming winter would be necessary, and would detain us for\r\nseveral days, we took with us a supply of tools, as well as baskets of\r\nprovisions, and other things essential to our comfort.\r\n\r\nThe whole of our stud, excepting the ostrich, were in their paddocks\r\nnear the tree; but Jack, saying that his mother and Jenny really must\r\nnot walk the whole way, to the great amusement of the latter, leaped on\r\nHurry, and fled away in front of us. Before we had accomplished one\r\nquarter of the distance, we heard the thundering tread of many feet\r\ngalloping down the avenue, and presently espied our motley troop of\r\nsteeds being driven furiously toward us. Storm, Lightfoot, Swift,\r\nGrumble, Stentor, Arrow and Dart were there, with Jack, on his fleet\r\ntwo-legged courser, at their heels. At his saddlebow hung a cluster of\r\nsaddles and bridles, the bits all jangling and clanking, adding to the\r\ndin and confusion, and urging on the excited animals, who thoroughly\r\nentered into the fun, and with tails in the air, ears back, and heels\r\never and anon thrown playfully out, seemed about to overwhelm us.\r\n\r\nWe stepped aside to shelter ourselves behind the trees from the furious\r\nonset; but a shout from Fritz brought the whole herd to a sudden halt,\r\nand Jack spurred toward us.\r\n\r\n"Which of the cattle shall we saddle for you, Jenny?" he shouted;\r\n"they\'re all as gentle as lambs, and as active as cats. Every one has\r\nbeen ridden by mother; and knows what a side-saddle means, so you can\'t\r\ngo wrong."\r\n\r\nTo his great delight, Jenny quickly showed her appreciation of the\r\nmerits of the steeds by picking out Dart, the fleetest and most spirited\r\nin the whole stud.\r\n\r\nThe ostrich was then relieved of his unusual burden, the animals were\r\nspeedily equipped, and Lightfoot bearing the baskets and hampers, the\r\nwhole party mounted and trotted forward. Jenny was delighted with her\r\npalfrey, and henceforward he was reserved for her special use.\r\n\r\nThe work at Falconhurst, as I had expected, occupied us for some time,\r\nand it was a week before we could again return to Rockburg. Yet the time\r\npassed pleasantly; for though the young men were busy from morning to\r\nnight, the presence of their new companion, her lively spirits and gay\r\nconversation, kept them in constant good humor.\r\n\r\nWhen the repairs were all finished, we remained yet a day or two longer,\r\nthat we might make excursions in various directions to bring in poultry\r\nfrom Woodlands, stores of acorns for the pigs, and grass, willows, and\r\ncanes, to be manufactured during the winter into mats, baskets, hurdles,\r\nand hencoops.\r\n\r\nMany a shower wetted us through during these days, and we had scarcely\r\ntime to hurry back to Rockburg and house our cattle and possessions\r\nbefore the annual deluge began.\r\n\r\nNever before had this dreary season seemed so short and pleasant; with\r\nJenny among us, the usual feeling of weariness and discontent never\r\nappeared; the English language was quickly acquired by all hands, Fritz,\r\nin particular, speaking it so well that Jenny declared she could\r\nscarcely believe he was not an Englishman. She herself already spoke\r\nFrench, and therefore easily learned our native language and spoke it\r\nfluently before we were released from our captivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n Spring and its accompanying work--The mysterious guns--Who fired\r\n     them--A storm--Fritz and I reconnoiter--The English brig--We visit\r\n     her in the yacht--Captain Littlestone--We are cordially\r\n     welcomed--Mr. Wolston and his family--An earnest consultation--Our\r\n     visitors at Rockburg--The supper--Who is for Europe and who for\r\n     New Switzerland?--The decision--Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany wondrous tales were told or read in turn by the boys and Jenny\r\nduring the long evenings as we sat drawing, weaving, and plaiting in our\r\ncozy study. In fact this winter was a truly happy time, and when at\r\nlength the rain ceased and the bright sun again smiled upon the face of\r\nnature, we could scarcely believe, as we stepped forth and once more\r\nfelt the balmy breath of spring, that, for so many weeks, we had been\r\nprisoners within our rocky walls.\r\n\r\nAll was once more activity and life; the duties in field, garden, and\r\norchard called forth the energy of the lads, while their mother and\r\nsister found abundant occupation in the poultry yard and house.\r\n\r\nOur various settlements and stations required attention. Falconhurst,\r\nWoodlands, Prospect Hill, Shark and Whale Islands were in turn visited\r\nand set in order. The duty of attending to the island battery fell to\r\nJack and Franz.\r\n\r\nThey had been busy all day repairing the flagstaff, rehoisting the flag,\r\nand cleaning and putting into working order the two guns.\r\n\r\nEvening was drawing on and our day\'s work over; the rest of us were\r\nstrolling up and down upon the beach, enjoying the cool sea breeze. They\r\nloaded and ran out their guns, and paddling off with an empty tub in\r\nthe cajack, placed it out at sea as a mark for practice. They returned\r\nand fired, and the barrel flew in pieces, and then, with a shout of\r\ntriumph, they cleaned the guns and ran them in.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they done so when, as though in answer to their shots, came\r\nthe sound of three guns booming across the water from the westward.\r\n\r\nWe stopped, speechless. Was it fancy? Had we really heard guns from a\r\nstrange ship? Or had the boys again fired? No! there were the lads\r\nleaping into their canoe and paddling in hot haste toward us. They, too,\r\nhad heard the sound.\r\n\r\nA tumult of feelings rushed over us--anxiety, joy, hope, doubt, each in\r\nturn took possession of our minds. Was it a European vessel close upon\r\nour shores, and were we about to be linked once more to civilized life?\r\nOr did those sounds proceed from a Malay pirate, who would rob and\r\nmurder us! What was to be the result of meeting with our fellow beings;\r\nwere they to be friends who would help us, enemies who would attack us,\r\nor would they prove unfortunate creatures in need of our assistance? Who\r\ncould tell?\r\n\r\nBefore we could express these thoughts in words the cajack had touched\r\nthe shore, and Jack and Franz were among us.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear them? Did you hear them?" they gasped. "What shall we do?\r\nWhere shall we go?"\r\n\r\n"O Fritz," continued my youngest son, "it must be a European ship. We\r\nshall find her. We shall see our Fatherland once more," and in an\r\nemotion of joy he grasped his brother\'s hands.\r\n\r\nTill then I knew not what a craving for civilized life had been aroused\r\nin the two young men by the appearance of their European sister.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned toward me. What would I advise?\r\n\r\n"At present," I said, "we can do nothing, for night is drawing on. We\r\nmust make what preparations we can, and pray for guidance."\r\n\r\nIn the greatest excitement we returned to the house, all talking\r\neagerly, and till late no one could be persuaded to retire to rest.\r\n\r\nFew slept that night. The boys and I took it in turn to keep watch from\r\nthe veranda, lest more signals might be fired, or a hostile visit might\r\nbe paid us. But about midnight the wind began to rise, and before we\r\nreassembled to discuss our plans a fearful storm was raging; so terrific\r\nwas the sea that I knew no boat could live, and had a broadside been\r\nfired at the entrance of the bay we should not have heard it through the\r\nhowling of the blast. For two days and two nights the hurricane\r\ncontinued, but on the third day the sun again appeared, and, the wind\r\nlulling, the sea went rapidly down. Full of anxiety, I readily complied\r\nwith the boys\' desire to put off to Shark Island and discharge the guns;\r\nfor who could tell what had been the result of the gale; perhaps the\r\nvessel had been driven upon the rocky shore, or, fearing such a fate,\r\nshe had left the coast and weathered the storm out at sea; if so, she\r\nmight never return.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts I accompanied Jack and Franz to the fort.\r\nOne--two--we fired the guns and waited.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes there was no reply, and then an answering report rolled\r\nin the distance. There was no longer room for doubt; the strangers were\r\nstill in the vicinity, and were aware of our presence. We waved the flag\r\nas a signal to those on shore that all was well, and quickly returned.\r\nWe found the whole family in a state of the greatest excitement, and I\r\nfelt it necessary to calm them down as much as possible, for neither\r\ncould I answer the questions with which I was besieged, nor could I\r\nconceal the fact that the visit of the vessel might not prove so\r\nadvantageous as they expected.\r\n\r\nFritz and I at once prepared to make a reconnoitre; we armed ourselves\r\nwith our guns, pistols, and cutlasses, took a spyglass, seated ourselves\r\nin the cajack, and with a parting entreaty from the mother to be\r\ncautious, paddled out of the bay and round the high cliffs on our left.\r\nFor nearly an hour we advanced in the direction from which the reports\r\nof the guns seemed to proceed. Nothing could we see, however, but the\r\nfrowning rocks and cliffs, and the waves beating restlessly at their\r\nbase. Cape Pug-Nose was reached, and we began to round the bluff old\r\npoint. In a moment all our doubts were dispelled, and joy and gratitude\r\nto the Great Giver of all good filled our hearts. There, in the little\r\nsheltered cove beyond the cape, her sails furled, and anchor dropped,\r\nlay a brig of war with the English colors at her masthead.\r\n\r\nWith the glass I could discern figures upon the deck, and upon the shore\r\nbeyond several tents pitched under the shelter of the trees, and the\r\nsmoke of fires rising among them. As I handed the glass to Fritz, I felt\r\na sudden misgiving. "What," said I to myself, "can this English vessel\r\nbe doing thus far from the usual track of ships?" and I called to mind\r\ntales of mutinous crews who had risen against their officers, have\r\nchosen some such sheltered retreat as this; have disguised the vessel,\r\nand then sailed forth to rob and plunder upon the high seas.\r\n\r\nFritz then exclaimed: "I can see the captain, father; he is speaking to\r\none of the officers, and I can see his face quite well; he is English, I\r\nam certain he is English, and the flag speaks the truth!" and he put the\r\nglass again in my hand that I might see for myself.\r\n\r\nStill keeping under the shelter of the cliff, I carefully surveyed the\r\nvessel. There was no doubt that Fritz was right, and my fears were once\r\nmore dispelled; all was neatness and regularity on board; the spotless\r\ndecks, the burnished steel and brass, and the air of perfect order which\r\npervaded both ship and camp, betokened that authority and discipline\r\nthere reigned. For some minutes longer we continued our examination of\r\nthe scene, and then, satisfied by the appearance of the camp on shore\r\nthat there was no chance of the brig quitting the coast for several\r\ndays, we resolved to return without betraying our presence, for I was\r\nunwilling to appear before these strangers until we could do so in\r\nbetter form, and in a manner more in accordance with our actual\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nWe again landed at Rockburg, where our family awaited our arrival in\r\neager expectation, and as fully as possible we told them of all we had\r\nseen. They thoroughly approved of our caution, and even Jenny, whose\r\nhopes had been excited to the highest pitch by our description of the\r\nEnglish vessel, and who longed to meet her countrymen once more, agreed\r\nto postpone the visit until the following day, when, having put our\r\nyacht into good order, we might pay our respects to the captain, not as\r\npoor shipwrecked creatures begging assistance, but as lords and masters\r\nof the land, seeking to know for what purpose strangers were visiting\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was occupied in making our preparations. Our dainty\r\nlittle craft was made to look her very best; her decks were scrubbed,\r\nher brass guns burnished, all lumber removed and put ashore, and the\r\nflag of England hoisted to her peak. The mother overhauled our\r\nwardrobes, and the neatest uniforms were put ready for the boys and me,\r\nfor though neither my wife nor Jenny had ever dreamed of appearing\r\notherwise than they would have done had they been at home among\r\ncivilized people in Europe, yet we, accustomed daily to rough and often\r\neven dirty work, had adopted just that custom which best suited our\r\ncomfort and inclination. We should indeed have surprised the smart\r\nman-o\'-war\'s men, had we appeared in our great, shapeless, wide-brimmed\r\nhats, our linen coats and trousers, our broad leathern belts and hairy\r\nbuskins; so we next day readily donned the more becoming costumes.\r\n\r\nAt the break of that eventful morn, when we were destined once more to\r\nset our eyes upon our fellow-men, and to hear news of the outer world,\r\nfrom which for so many years we had been exiled, we assembled in our\r\nlittle breakfast room. The meal was eaten hurriedly and almost in\r\nsilence, for our hearts were too full, and our minds too busily\r\noccupied, to allow of any outward display of excitement. Fritz and Jack\r\nthen slipped quietly out, and presently returned from the garden with\r\nbaskets of the choicest fruits in fresh and fragrant profusion, and with\r\nthese, as presents for the strangers, we went on board our yacht.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was weighed, the sails set, and with the canoe in tow the\r\nlittle vessel, as though partaking of our hopes and joyous expectation,\r\nbounded merrily over the waters of Safety Bay, gave a wide berth to the\r\nReef, against whose frowning rocks the sea still lashed itself to foam,\r\nand kept away from the cove, where the English ship unconsciously\r\nawaited us. The Pug-Nosed Cape was reached, and, to the surprise and\r\nutter amazement of the strangers, we rounded the point and brought up\r\nwithin hail. Every eye on board and on shore was turned toward us, every\r\nglass was produced and fixed upon our motions; for of all the strange\r\nsights which the gallant crew may have looked for, such an anomaly as a\r\npleasure yacht, manned by such a party as ours, and cruising upon this\r\nstrange and inhospitable shore, was the furthest from their thoughts.\r\n\r\nFritz and I stepped into our boat and pulled for the brig. In another\r\nminute we were upon her deck. The captain, with the simple frankness of\r\na British seaman, welcomed us cordially, and having led us into his\r\ncabin, begged us to explain to what good fortune he owed a visit from\r\nresidents upon a coast generally deemed uninhabited, or the abode of the\r\nfiercest savages.\r\n\r\nI gave him an outline of the history of the wreck, and of our sojourn\r\nupon these shores, and spoke to him, too, of Miss Montrose, and of the\r\nprovidential way in which we had been the means of rescuing her from her\r\nlonely position.\r\n\r\n"Then," said the gallant officer, rising and grasping Fritz by the hand,\r\n"let me heartily thank you in my own name, and in that of Colonel\r\nMontrose; for it was the hope of finding some trace of that brave girl\r\nthat led me to these shores. The disappearance of the _Dorcas_ has been\r\na terrible blow to the colonel, and yet, though for three years no word\r\nof her or any of those who sailed in her has reached England, he has\r\nnever entirely abandoned all hope of again hearing of his daughter. I\r\nknew this, and a few weeks ago, when I was about to leave Sydney for the\r\nCape, I found three men who declared themselves survivors of the\r\n_Dorcas_ and said that their boat, of four which left the wreck, was the\r\nonly one which, to their knowledge, reached land in safety. From them I\r\nlearned all particulars, and applying for permission to cruise in these\r\nlatitudes, I sailed in hopes of finding further traces of the\r\nunfortunate crew. My efforts have been rewarded by unlooked-for\r\nsuccess."\r\n\r\nFritz replied most modestly to the praises which he received, and then\r\nthe captain begged to be introduced to my wife and Miss Montrose.\r\n\r\n"And," he continued, "if it be not contrary to your rules of discipline\r\nfor the whole ship\'s company to be absent at once, I will now send a\r\nboat for the remainder of your party."\r\n\r\nOne of the officers was accordingly dispatched to the yacht with a\r\npolite message, and the mother, Jenny, and the boys were presently on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nOur kind host greeted them most warmly, and he and his officers vied\r\nwith one another in doing us honor. They proved, indeed, most pleasant\r\nentertainers, and the time passed rapidly away. At luncheon the captain\r\ntold us that there had sailed with him from Sydney an invalid gentleman,\r\nMr. Wolston, his wife, and two daughters; but that, though the sea\r\nvoyage had been recommended on account of his health, yet it had not\r\ndone Mr. Wolston so much good as had been anticipated, and he had\r\nsuffered so greatly from the effects of the storm, which had driven the\r\n_Unicorn_ into the bay for repairs, that he had been eager to rest for a\r\nshort time on land.\r\n\r\nWe were anxious to meet the family, and in the afternoon it was decided\r\nthat we should pay them a visit. Tents had been pitched for their\r\naccommodation under the shady trees, and when we landed we found Mr.\r\nWolston seated by one of them, enjoying the cool sea breeze. He and his\r\nfamily were delighted to see us, and so much did we enjoy their society,\r\nthat evening found us still upon the shore. It was too late then to\r\nreturn to Rockburg, and the captain kindly offered tents for the\r\naccommodation of those who could not find room in the yacht. The boys\r\nspent the night on land.\r\n\r\nThat night I had a long and serious consultation with my wife, as to\r\nwhether or not we really had any well grounded reason for wishing to\r\nreturn to Europe. It would be childish to undertake a voyage thither\r\nsimply because an opportunity offered for doing so.\r\n\r\nNeither knew to what decision the feelings of the other inclined; each\r\nwas afraid of expressing what might run counter to those feelings; but\r\ngradually it began to appear that neither entertained any strong wish to\r\nleave the peaceful island; and finally we discovered that the real wish\r\nwhich lay at the bottom of both our hearts was to adopt New Switzerland\r\nas thenceforward our home.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more delightful than to find harmony of opinion in those we\r\nlove, when a great and momentous decision has to be taken?\r\n\r\nMy dear wife assured me that she desired nothing more earnestly than to\r\nspend the rest of her days in a place to which she had become so much\r\nattached, provided I, and at least two of her sons, also wished to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nFrom the other two she would willingly part, if they chose to return to\r\nEurope, with the understanding that they must endeavor to send out\r\nemigrants of a good class to join us, and form a prosperous colony,\r\nadding that she thought the island ought to continue to bear the name of\r\nour native country, even if inhabited in future time by colonists from\r\nEngland, as well as from Switzerland.\r\n\r\nI heartily approved of this excellent idea, and we agreed to mention it,\r\nwhile consulting with Captain Littlestone on the subject of placing the\r\nisland under the protection of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThen came the question as to which of our sons were best suited to\r\nremain with us, and which to go away.\r\n\r\nThis point we left undecided, thinking that in the course of a few days\r\nthey would probably make a choice of their own accord, which they did,\r\neven sooner than we anticipated.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, it was proposed that Captain Littlestone should bring\r\nhis ship round to Safety Bay, that we might receive a visit from him and\r\nhis party, at Rockburg--where we invited the invalid, Mr. Wolston, and\r\nhis family, in hopes that his health might benefit by a comfortable\r\nresidence on shore.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this plan adopted, than Fritz and Jack hurried off in the\r\ncanoe to prepare for their reception, being followed in more leisurely\r\nstyle by the brig and our yacht.\r\n\r\nBut what words can express the amazement of our guests, when, rounding\r\nthe Rocky Cape at the entrance, Safety Bay, the beautiful domain of\r\nRockburg lay before them.\r\n\r\nStill greater was their astonishment, as a salute of eleven guns boomed\r\nfrom the battery on Shark Island, where the royal standard of England\r\nwas displayed and floated majestically on the morning breeze.\r\n\r\nA glow of surprise and pleasure beamed on every countenance, and poor\r\nWolston\'s spirits appeared to revive with the very idea of peace and\r\nhappiness to be enjoyed in such a home.\r\n\r\nHe was carried on shore with the utmost care and tenderness, and\r\ncomfortably established in my room, a camp-bed for Mrs. Wolston being\r\nadded to the furniture there, that she might be able conveniently to\r\nattend on her husband.\r\n\r\nMeantime the scene at the harbor and all round Rockburg was of the\r\nliveliest description; merriment and excitement prevailed in all\r\ndirections, as the beauties and wonders of our residence were explored,\r\nso that a summons to dinner scarcely attracted notice.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a visit to Falconhurst was projected, the company was at\r\nlength induced to be seated, and to partake of our good cheer, but the\r\nspirit of restlessness soon returned, and the young people kept roaming\r\nabout through our hitherto quiet lawns, avenues, and shrubberies, until\r\nI was ready to believe their number three times what it actually was.\r\n\r\nToward evening the universal excitement began to abate, and the party\r\nassembled for supper with tolerable composure.\r\n\r\nMr. Wolston was able to join us, as the rest he had enjoyed, and the\r\npleasure inspired by the hope of a residence among us, seemed to have\r\ngiven him new life. This wish he now distinctly expressed in his own\r\nname, and in that of his wife; inquiring what our intentions were, and\r\nproposing, if agreeable to us, that they, with their eldest daughter,\r\nwhose health, like his own, was delicate, should make a long stay on the\r\nisland, while the younger daughter went for the present to her brother\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIn the event of his ultimately deciding to settle altogether among us,\r\nMr. Wolston would propose that his son should leave the Cape, and join\r\nour colony.\r\n\r\nWith sincere satisfaction I welcomed this proposal, saying that it was\r\nmy wish and that of my wife to remain for the rest of our days in New\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for New Switzerland!"\r\n\r\n"New Switzerland forever!" shouted the whole company enthusiastically,\r\nas they raised their glasses, and made them touch with a musical ring,\r\nwhich so expressively denotes a joyful unanimity of sentiment.\r\n\r\n"Prosperity to New Switzerland: long may she flourish;" echoed on all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n"Long life and happiness to those who make New Switzerland their home!"\r\nadded Ernest, to my great surprise, leaning forward as he spoke, to\r\nring his glass with mine, his mother\'s, and Mr. Wolston\'s.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t somebody wish long life and prosperity to those who go away?"\r\ninquired Jenny, with a pretty, arch look. "Much as I long to return to\r\nEngland and my father, my inclination will waver if all the cheers are\r\nfor New Switzerland!"\r\n\r\n"Three cheers for England and Colonel Montrose," cried Fritz; "success\r\nand happiness to us who return to Europe!" and while the vaulted roofs\r\nrang with the cheering elicited by this toast, a glance from Jenny\r\nshowed him how much she thanked him for appreciating her wish, to return\r\nto her father, notwithstanding her attachment to our family.\r\n\r\n"Well," said I, when silence was restored, "since Fritz resolves to go\r\nto England, he must undertake for me the duty of bringing happiness to a\r\nmourning father by restoring to him this dear daughter, whom I have been\r\nready to regard as my own, by right of her cast on the shores of my\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n"Ernest chooses to remain with me. His mother and I rejoice heartily in\r\nthis decision, and promise him all the highest scientific appointments\r\nin our power to bestow.\r\n\r\n"And now what is Jack\'s choice? The only talent I can say he possesses\r\nis that of a comic actor, and to shine on the stage he must needs go to\r\nEurope."\r\n\r\n"Jack is not going to Europe, however," was his reply. "He means to stay\r\nhere, and when Fritz is gone he will be the best rider and the best shot\r\nin New Switzerland, which is the summit of his ambition.\r\n\r\n"The fact is," he continued, laughing, "I rather stand in awe of their\r\nEuropean schools, and should expect to find myself caught and clapped\r\ninto one if I ventured too near them."\r\n\r\n"A good school is exactly what I want," said Franz. "Among a number of\r\nstudents there is some emulation and enthusiasm, and I shall have a\r\nchance of rising in the world."\r\n\r\n"Fritz will probably return here some day; but it might be well for one\r\nmember of the family to go home with the intention of remaining there\r\naltogether, and as I am the youngest I could more easily than the rest\r\nadapt myself to a different life. My father, however, will decide for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You may go, my dear son," I replied; "and God bless all our plans and\r\nresolutions. The whole earth is the Lord\'s, and where, as in his sight,\r\nyou lead good and useful lives, there is your home.\r\n\r\n"And now that I know your wishes, the only question is whether Captain\r\nLittlestone will kindly enable you to carry them out?"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were fixed eagerly upon him, and after a moment\'s pause the\r\ngallant officer spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n"I think my way in this matter is perfectly clear, and I consider that I\r\nhave been providentially guided to be the means of once more placing\r\nthis family in communication with their friends and with the civilized\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"My orders were to search for a shipwrecked crew.\r\n\r\n"Survivors from two wrecks have been discovered.\r\n\r\n"Three passengers express a wish to leave my ship here, instead of at\r\nthe Cape, while, at the same time, I am requested to give to three\r\npersons a passage to England.\r\n\r\n"Could anything suit better? I am most willing to undertake the charge\r\nof those who may be committed to my care.\r\n\r\n"Every circumstance has been wonderfully ordered and linked together by\r\nDivine Providence, and if England gains a prosperous and happy colony,\r\nit will prove a fitting clasp to this fortunate chain of events. Three\r\ncheers for New Switzerland!"\r\n\r\nDeep emotion stirred every heart as the party separated for the night.\r\nMany felt that they were suddenly standing on the threshold of a new\r\nlife, while, for myself, a weight was rolled from my heart, and I\r\nthanked God that a difficulty was solved which, for years, had\r\noppressed me with anxiety.\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing was thought of but making preparations for the\r\ndeparture of the dear ones bound for England. Captain Littlestone\r\nallowed as much time as he could spare; but it was necessarily short, so\r\nthat incessant movement and industry pervaded the settlement for several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nEverything was provided and packed up that could in any way add to our\r\nchildren\'s comfort on the voyage, or benefit them after their arrival in\r\nEngland, and a large share of my possessions in pearls, corals, furs,\r\nspices, and other valuables would enable them to take a good position in\r\nthe world of commerce.\r\n\r\nI committed to their care private papers, money, and jewels which I knew\r\nto have been the personal property of the captain of our ill-fated ship,\r\ndesiring them to hand them over, if possible, to his heirs. A short\r\naccount of the wreck, with the names of the crew, a list of which I had\r\nfound, was given to Captain Littlestone.\r\n\r\nFritz, having previously made known to me, what indeed was very evident,\r\nthe attachment between himself and Jenny, I advised him to mention it to\r\nColonel Montrose as soon as possible after being introduced to him, and\r\nask for his sanction to their engagement. I, on my part, gladly\r\nbestowing mine, as did his mother, who loved the sweet girl dearly, and\r\nheartily grieved to part with her.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before our separation, I gave to Fritz the journal in\r\nwhich, ever since the shipwreck, I had chronicled the events of our\r\nlife, desiring that the story might be printed and published.\r\n\r\n"It was written, as you well know," said I, "for the instruction and\r\namusement of my children, but it is very possible that it may be useful\r\nto other young people, more especially to boys.\r\n\r\n"Children are, on the whole, very much alike everywhere, and you four\r\nlads fairly represent multitudes, who are growing up in all directions.\r\nIt will make me happy to think that my simple narrative may lead some of\r\nthese to observe how blessed are the results of patient continuance in\r\nwell-doing, what benefits arise from the thoughtful application of\r\nknowledge and science, and how good and pleasant a thing it is when\r\nbrethren dwell together in unity, under the eye of parental love."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNight has closed around me.\r\n\r\nFor the last time my united family slumbers beneath my care.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow this closing chapter of my journey will pass into the hands of\r\nmy eldest son.\r\n\r\nFrom afar I greet thee, Europe!\r\n\r\nI greet thee, dear old Switzerland!\r\n\r\nLike thee, may New Switzerland flourish and prosper--good, happy, and\r\nfree!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAL KEEN MYSTERY STORIES\r\n\r\nBy HUGH LLOYD\r\n\r\n\r\nBoys!

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
