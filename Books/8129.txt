Beyond them to the\r\neast there lies a desert, for ever untroubled by man: all yellow it is,\r\nand spotted with shadows of stones, and Death is in it, like a leopard\r\nlying in the sun. To the south they are bounded by magic, to the west by a\r\nmountain, and to the north by the voice and anger of the Polar wind. Like\r\na great wall is the mountain to the west. It comes up out of the distance\r\nand goes down into the distance again, and it is named Poltarnees,\r\nBeholder of Ocean. To the northward red rocks, smooth and bare of soil,\r\nand without any speck of moss or herbage, slope up to the very lips of the\r\nPolar wind, and there is nothing else there by the noise of his anger.\r\nVery peaceful are the Inner Lands, and very fair are their cities, and\r\nthere is no war among them, but quiet and ease. And they have no enemy but\r\nage, for thirst and fever lie sunning themselves out in the mid-desert,\r\nand never prowl into the Inner Lands. And the ghouls and ghosts, whose\r\nhighway is the night, are kept in the south by the boundary of magic. And\r\nvery small are all their pleasant cities, and all men are known to one\r\nanother therein, and bless one another by name as they meet in the\r\nstreets. And they have a broad, green way in every city that comes in out\r\nof some vale or wood or downland, and wanders in and out about the city\r\nbetween the houses and across the streets, and the people walk along it\r\nnever at all, but every year at her appointed time Spring walks along it\r\nfrom the flowery lands, causing the anemone to bloom on the green way and\r\nall the early joys of hidden woods, or deep, secluded vales, or triumphant\r\ndownlands, whose heads lift up so proudly, far up aloof from cities.\r\n\r\nSometimes waggoners or shepherds walk along this way, they that have come\r\ninto the city from over cloudy ridges, and the townsmen hinder them not,\r\nfor there is a tread that troubleth the grass and a tread that troubleth\r\nit not, and each man in his own heart knoweth which tread he hath. And in\r\nthe sunlit spaces of the weald and in the wold\'s dark places, afar from\r\nthe music of cities and from the dance of the cities afar, they make there\r\nthe music of the country places and dance the country dance. Amiable, near\r\nand friendly appears to these men the sun, and as he is genial to them and\r\ntends their younger vines, so they are kind to the little woodland things\r\nand any rumour of the fairies or old legend. And when the light of some\r\nlittle distant city makes a slight flush upon the edge of the sky, and the\r\nhappy golden windows of the homesteads stare gleaming into the dark, then\r\nthe old and holy figure of Romance, cloaked even to the face, comes down\r\nout of hilly woodlands and bids dark shadows to rise and dance, and sends\r\nthe forest creatures forth to prowl, and lights in a moment in her bower\r\nof grass the little glowworm\'s lamp, and brings a hush down over the grey\r\nlands, and out of it rises faintly on far-off hills the voice of a lute.\r\nThere are not in the world lands more prosperous and happy than Toldees,\r\nMondath, Arizim.\r\n\r\nFrom these three little kingdoms that are named the Inner Lands the young\r\nmen stole constantly away. One by one they went, and no one knew why they\r\nwent save that they had a longing to behold the Sea. Of this longing they\r\nspoke little, but a young man would become silent for a few days, and\r\nthen, one morning very early, he would slip away and slowly climb\r\nPoltarnee\'s difficult slope, and having attained the top pass over and\r\nnever return. A few stayed behind in the Inner Lands and became the old\r\nmen, but none that had ever climbed Poltarnees from the very earliest\r\ntimes had ever come back again. Many had gone up Poltarnees sworn to\r\nreturn. Once a king sent all his courtiers, one by one, to report the\r\nmystery to him, and then went himself; none ever returned.\r\n\r\nNow, it was the wont of the folk of the Inner Lands to worship rumours and\r\nlegends of the Sea, and all that their prophets discovered of the Sea was\r\nwrit in a sacred book, and with deep devotion on days of festival or\r\nmourning read in the temples by the priests. Now, all their temples lay\r\nopen to the west, resting upon pillars, that the breeze from the Sea might\r\nenter them, and they lay open on pillars to the east that the breezes of\r\nthe Sea might not be hindered by pass onward wherever the Sea list. And\r\nthis is the legend that they had of the Sea, whom none in the Inner Lands\r\nhad ever beholden. They say that the Sea is a river heading towards\r\nHercules, and they say that he touches against the edge of the world, and\r\nthat Poltarnees looks upon him. They say that all the worlds of heaven go\r\nbobbing on this river and are swept down with the stream, and that\r\nInfinity is thick and furry with forests through which the river in his\r\ncourse sweeps on with all the worlds of heaven. Among the colossal trunks\r\nof those dark trees, the smallest fronds of whose branches are man nights,\r\nthere walk the gods. And whenever its thirst, glowing in space like a\r\ngreat sun, comes upon the beast, the tiger of the gods creeps down to the\r\nriver to drink. And the tiger of the gods drinks his fill loudly, whelming\r\nworlds the while, and the level of the river sinks between its banks ere\r\nthe beast\'s thirst is quenched and ceases to glow like a sun. And many\r\nworlds thereby are heaped up dry and stranded, and the gods walk not among\r\nthem evermore, because they are hard to their feet. These are the worlds\r\nthat have no destiny, whose people know no god. And the river sweeps\r\nonwards ever. And the name of the River is Oriathon, but men call it\r\nOcean. This is the Lower Faith of the Inner Lands. And there is a Higher\r\nFaith which is not told to all. Oriathon sweeps on through the forests of\r\nInfinity and all at once falls roaring over an Edge, whence Time has long\r\nago recalled his hours to fight in his war with the gods; and falls unlit\r\nby the flash of nights and days, with his flood unmeasured by miles, into\r\nthe deeps of nothing.\r\n\r\nNow as the centuries went by and the one way by which a man could climb\r\nPoltarnees became worn with feet, more and more men surmounted it, not to\r\nreturn. And still they knew not in the Inner Lands upon what mystery\r\nPoltarnees looked. For on a still day and windless, while men walked\r\nhappily about their beautiful streets or tended flocks in the country,\r\nsuddenly the west wind would bestir himself and come in from the Sea. And\r\nhe would come cloaked and grey and mournful and carry to someone the\r\nhungry cry of the Sea calling out for bones of men. And he that heard it\r\nwould move restlessly for some hours, and at last would rise suddenly,\r\nirresistibly up, setting his face to Poltarnees, and would say, as is the\r\ncustom of those lands when men part briefly, "Till a man\'s heart\r\nremembereth," which means "Farewell for a while"; but those that loved\r\nhim, seeing his eyes on Poltarnees, would answer sadly, "Till the gods\r\nforget," which means "Farewell."\r\n\r\nNow the king of Arizim had a daughter who played with the wild wood\r\nflowers, and with the fountains in her father\'s court, and with the little\r\nblue heaven-birds that came to her doorway in the winter to shelter from\r\nthe snow. And she was more beautiful than the wild wood flowers, or than\r\nall the fountains in her father\'s court, or than the blue heaven-birds in\r\ntheir full winter plumage when they shelter from the snow. The old wise\r\nkings of Mondath and of Toldees saw her once as she went lightly down the\r\nlittle paths of her garden, and turning their gaze into the mists of\r\nthought, pondered the destiny of their Inner Lands. And they watched her\r\nclosely by the stately flowers, and standing alone in the sunlight, and\r\npassing and repassing the strutting purple birds that the king\'s fowlers\r\nhad brought from Asag\xe9hon. When she was of the age of fifteen years the\r\nKing of Mondath called a council of kings. And there met with him the\r\nkings of Toldees and Arizim. And the King of Mondath in his Council said:\r\n\r\n"The call of the unappeased and hungry Sea (and at the word \'Sea\' the\r\nthree kings bowed their heads) lures every year out of our happy kingdoms\r\nmore and more of our men, and still we know not the mystery of the Sea,\r\nand no devised oath has brought one man back. Now thy daughter, Arizim, is\r\nlovelier than the sunlight, and lovelier than those stately flowers of\r\nthine that stand so tall in her garden, and hath more grace and beauty\r\nthan those strange birds that the venturous fowlers bring in creaking\r\nwagons out of Asag\xe9hon, whose feathers are alternate purple and white.\r\nNow, he that shall love thy daughter, Hilnaric, whoever he shall be, is\r\nthe man to climb Poltarnees and return, as none hath ever before, and tell\r\nus upon what Poltarnees looks; for it may be that they daughter is more\r\nbeautiful than the Sea."\r\n\r\nThen from his Seat of Council arose the King of Arizim. He said: "I fear\r\nthat thou hast spoken blasphemy against the Sea, and I have a dread that\r\nill will come of it. Indeed I had not thought she was so fair. It is such\r\na short while ago that she was quite a small child with her hair still\r\nunkempt and not yet attired in the manner of princesses, and she would go\r\nup into the wild woods unattended and come back with her robes unseemly\r\nand all torn, and would not take reproof with a humble spirit, but made\r\ngrimaces even in my marble court all set about with fountains."\r\n\r\nThen said the King of Toldees:\r\n\r\n"Let us watch more closely and let us see the Princess Hilnaric in the\r\nseason of the orchard-bloom when the great birds go by that know the Sea,\r\nto rest in our inland places; and if she be more beautiful than the\r\nsunrise over our folded kingdoms when all the orchards bloom, it may be\r\nthat she is more beautiful than the Sea."\r\n\r\nAnd the King of Arizim said:\r\n\r\n"I fear this is terrible blasphemy, yet will I do as you have decided in\r\ncouncil."\r\n\r\nAnd the season of the orchard-bloom appeared. One night the King of Arizim\r\ncalled his daughter forth on his outer balcony of marble. And the moon was\r\nrising huge and round and holy over dark woods, and all the fountains were\r\nsinging to the night. And the moon touched the marble palace gables, and\r\nthey glowed in the land. And the moon touched the heads of all the\r\nfountains, and the grey columns broke into fairy lights. And the moon left\r\nthe dark ways of the forest and lit the whole white palace and its\r\nfountains and shone on the forehead of the Princess, and the palace of\r\nArizim glowed afar, and the fountains became columns of gleaming jewels\r\nand song. And the moon made a music at its rising, but it fell a little\r\nshort of mortal ears. And Hilnaric stood there wondering, clad in white,\r\nwith the moonlight shining on her forehead; and watching her from the\r\nshadows on the terrace stood the kings of Mondath and Toldees. They said.\r\n\r\n"She is more beautiful than the moonrise." And the season of the\r\norchard-bloom appeared. One night the King of Arizim called his daughter\r\nforth on his outer balcony of marble. And the moon was rising huge and\r\nround and holy over dark woods, and all the fountains were singing to the\r\nnight. And the moon touched the marble palace gables, and they glowed in\r\nthe land. And the moon touched the heads of all the fountains, and the\r\ngrey columns broke into fairy lights. And the moon left the dark ways of\r\nthe forest and lit the whole white palace and its fountains and shone on\r\nthe forehead of the Princess, and the palace of Arizim glowed afar, and\r\nthe fountains became columns of gleaming jewels and song. And the moon\r\nmade a music at its rising, but it fell a little short of mortal ears. And\r\nHilnaric stood there wondering, clad in white, with the moonlight shining\r\non her forehead; and watching her from the shadows on the terrace stood\r\nthe kings of Mondath and Toldees. They said:\r\n\r\n"She is more beautiful than the moonrise." And on another day the King of\r\nArizim bade his daughter forth at dawn, and they stood again upon the\r\nbalcony. And the sun came up over a world of orchards, and the sea-mists\r\nwent back over Poltarnees to the Sea; little wild voices arose in all the\r\nthickets, the voices of the fountains began to die, and the song arose, in\r\nall the marble temples, of the birds that are sacred to the Sea. And\r\nHilnaric stood there, still glowing with dreams of heaven.\r\n\r\n"She is more beautiful," said the kings, "than morning."\r\n\r\nYet one more trial they made of Hilnaric\'s beauty, for they watched her on\r\nthe terraces at sunset ere yet the petals of the orchards had fallen, and\r\nall along the edge of neighbouring woods the rhododendron was blooming\r\nwith the azalea. And the sun went down under craggy Poltarnees, and the\r\nsea-mist poured over his summit inland. And the marble temples stood up\r\nclear in the evening, but films of twilight were drawn between the\r\nmountain and the city. Then from the Temple ledges and eaves of palaces\r\nthe bats fell headlong downwards, then spread their wings and floated up\r\nand down through darkening ways; lights came blinking out in golden\r\nwindows, men cloaked themselves against the grey sea-mist, the sound of\r\nsmall songs arose, and the face of Hilnaric became a resting-place for\r\nmysteries and dreams.\r\n\r\n"Than all these things," said the kings, "she is more lovely: but who can\r\nsay whether she is lovelier than the Sea?"\r\n\r\nProne in a rhododendron thicket at the edge of the palace lawns a hunter\r\nhad waited since the sun went down. Near to him was a deep pool where the\r\nhyacinths grew and strange flowers floated upon it with broad leaves; and\r\nthere the great bull gariachs came down to drink by starlight; and,\r\nwaiting there for the gariachs to come, he saw the white form of the\r\nPrincess leaning on her balcony. Before the stars shone out or the bulls\r\ncame down to drink he left his lurking-place and moved closer to the\r\npalace to see more nearly the Princess. The palace lawns were full of\r\nuntrodden dew, and everything was still when he came across them, holding\r\nhis great spear. In the farthest corner of the terraces the three old\r\nkings were discussing the beauty of Hilnaric and the destiny of the Inner\r\nLands. Moving lightly, with a hunter\'s tread, the watcher by the pool came\r\nvery near, even in the still evening, before the Princess saw him. When he\r\nsaw her closely he exclaimed suddenly:\r\n\r\n"She must be more beautiful than the Sea."\r\n\r\nWhen the Princess turned and saw his garb and his great spear she knew\r\nthat he was a hunter of gariachs.\r\n\r\nWhen the three kings heard the young man exclaim they said softly to one\r\nanother:\r\n\r\n"This must be the man."\r\n\r\nThen they revealed themselves to him, and spoke to him to try him. They\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Sir, you have spoken blasphemy against the Sea."\r\n\r\nAnd the young man muttered:\r\n\r\n"She is more beautiful than the Sea."\r\n\r\nAnd the kings said:\r\n\r\n"We are older than you and wiser, and know that nothing is more beautiful\r\nthan the Sea."\r\n\r\nAnd the young man took off the gear of his head, and became downcast, and\r\nhe knew that he spake with kings, yet he answered:\r\n\r\n"By this spear, she is more beautiful than the Sea."\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the Princess stared at him, knowing him to be a hunter\r\nof gariachs.\r\n\r\nThen the king of Arizim said to the watcher by the pool:\r\n\r\n"If thou wilt go up Poltarnees and come back, as none have come, and\r\nreport to us what lure or magic is in the Sea, we will pardon thy\r\nblasphemy, and thou shalt have the Princess to wife and sit among the\r\nCouncil of Kings."\r\n\r\nAnd gladly thereunto the young man consented. And the Princess spoke to\r\nhim, and asked him his name. And he told her that his name was Athelvok,\r\nand great joy arose in him at the sound of her voice. And to the three\r\nkings he promised to set out on the third day to scale the slope of\r\nPoltarnees and to return again, and this was the oath by which they bound\r\nhim to return:\r\n\r\n"I swear by the Sea that bears the worlds away, by the river of Oriathon,\r\nwhich men call Ocean, and by the gods and their tiger, and by the doom of\r\nthe worlds, that I will return again to the Inner Lands, having beheld the\r\nSea."\r\n\r\nAnd that oath he swore with solemnity that very night in one of the\r\ntemples of the Sea, but the three kings trusted more to the beauty of\r\nHilnaric even than to the power of the oath.\r\n\r\nThe next day Athelvok came to the palace of Arizim with the morning, over\r\nthe fields to the East and out of the country of Toldees, and Hilnaric\r\ncame out along her balcony and met him on the terraces. And she asked him\r\nif he had ever slain a gariach, and he said that he had slain three, and\r\nthen he told her how he had killed his first down by the pool in the wood.\r\nFor he had taken his father\'s spear and gone down to the edge of the pool,\r\nand had lain under the azaleas there waiting for the stars to shine, by\r\nwhose first light the gariachs go to the pools to drink; and he had gone\r\ntoo early and had had long to wait, and the passing hours seemed longer\r\nthan they were. And all the birds came in that home at night, and the bat\r\nwas abroad, and the hour of the duck went by, and still no gariach came\r\ndown to the pool; and Athelvok felt sure that none would come. And just as\r\nthis grew to a certainty in his mind the thicket parted noiselessly and a\r\nhuge bull gariach stood facing him on the edge of the water, and his great\r\nhorns swept out sideways from his head, and at the ends curved upwards,\r\nand were four strides in width from tip to tip. And he had not seen\r\nAthelvok, for the great bull was on the far side of the little pool, and\r\nAthelvok could not creep round to him for fear of meeting the wind (for\r\nthe gariachs, who can see little in the dark forests, rely on hearing and\r\nsmell). But he devised swiftly in his mind while the bull stood there with\r\nhead erect just twenty strides from him across the water. And the bull\r\nsniffed the wind cautiously and listened, then lowered his great head down\r\nto the pool and drank. At that instant Athelvok leapt into the water and\r\nshot forward through its weedy depths among the stems of the strange\r\nflowers that floated upon broad leaves on the surface. And Athelvok kept\r\nhis spear out straight before him, and the fingers of his left hand he\r\nheld rigid and straight, not pointing upwards, and so did not come to the\r\nsurface, but was carried onward by the strength of his spring and passed\r\nunentangled through the stems of the flowers. When Athelvok jumped into\r\nthe water the bull must have thrown his head up, startled at the splash,\r\nthen he would have listened and have sniffed the air, and neither hearing\r\nnor scenting any danger he must have remained rigid for some moments, for\r\nit was in that attitude that Athelvok found him as he emerged breathless\r\nat his feet. And, striking at once, Athelvok drove the spear into his\r\nthroat before the head and the terrible horns came down. But Athelvok had\r\nclung to one of the great horns, and had been carried at terrible speed\r\nthrough the rhododendron bushes until the gariach fell, but rose at once\r\nagain, and died standing up, still struggling, drowned in its own blood.\r\n\r\nBut to Hilnaric listening it was as though one of the heroes of old time\r\nhad come back again in the full glory of his legendary youth.\r\n\r\nAnd long time they went up and down the terraces, saying those things\r\nwhich were said before and since, and which lips shall yet be made to say\r\nagain. And above them stood Poltarnees beholding the Sea.\r\n\r\nAnd the day came when Athelvok should go. And Hilnaric said to him:\r\n\r\n"Will you not indeed most surely come back again, having just looked over\r\nthe summit of Poltarnees?"\r\n\r\nAthelvok answered: "I will indeed come back, for thy voice is more\r\nbeautiful than the hymn of the priests when they chant and praise the Sea,\r\nand though many tributary seas ran down into Oriathon and he and all the\r\nothers poured their beauty into one pool below me, yet would I return\r\nswearing that thou were fairer than they."\r\n\r\nAnd Hilnaric answered:\r\n\r\n"The wisdom of my heart tells me, or old knowledge or prophecy, or some\r\nstrange lore, that I shall never hear thy voice again. And for this I give\r\nthee my forgiveness."\r\n\r\nBut he, repeating the oath that he had sworn, set out, looking often\r\nbackwards until the slope became to step and his face was set to the rock.\r\nIt was in the morning that he started, and he climbed all the day with\r\nlittle rest, where every foot-hole was smooth with many feet. Before he\r\nreached the top the sun disappeared from him, and darker and darker grew\r\nthe Inner Lands. Then he pushed on so as to see before dark whatever thing\r\nPoltarnees had to show. The dusk was deep over the Inner Lands, and the\r\nlights of cities twinkled through the sea-mist when he came to\r\nPoltarnees\'s summit, and the sun before him was not yet gone from the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd there below him was the old wrinkled Sea, smiling and murmuring song.\r\nAnd he nursed little ships with gleaming sails, and in his hands were old\r\nregretted wrecks, and mast all studded over with golden nails that he had\r\nrent in anger out of beautiful galleons. And the glory of the sun was\r\namong the surges as they brought driftwood out of isles of spice, tossing\r\ntheir golden heads. And the grey currents crept away to the south like\r\ncompanionless serpents that love something afar with a restless, deadly\r\nlove. And the whole plain of water glittering with late sunlight, and the\r\nsurges and the currents and the white sails of ships were all together\r\nlike the face of a strange new god that has looked at a man for the first\r\ntime in the eyes at the moment of his death; and Athelvok, looking on the\r\nwonderful Sea, knew why it was that the dead never return, for there is\r\nsomething that the dead feel and know, and the living would never\r\nunderstand even though the dead should come and speak to them about it.\r\nAnd there was the Sea smiling at him, glad with the glory of the sun. And\r\nthere was a haven there for homing ships, and a sunlit city stood upon its\r\nmarge, and people walked about the streets of it clad in the unimagined\r\nmerchandise of far sea-bordering lands.\r\n\r\nAn easy slope of loose rock went from the top of Poltarnees to the shore\r\nof the Sea.\r\n\r\nFor a long while Athelvok stood there regretfully, knowing that there had\r\ncome something into his soul that no one in the Inner Lands could\r\nunderstand, where the thoughts of their minds had gone no farther than the\r\nthree little kingdoms. Then, looking long upon the wandering ships, and\r\nthe marvelous merchandise from alien lands, and the unknown colour that\r\nwreathed the brows of the Sea, he turned his face to the darkness and the\r\nInner Lands.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the Sea sang a dirge at sunset for all the harm that he had\r\ndone in anger and all the ruin wrought on adventurous ships; and there\r\nwere tears in the voice of the tyrannous Sea, for he had loved the\r\ngalleons that he had overwhelmed, and he called all men to him and all\r\nliving things that he might make amends, because he had loved the bones\r\nthat he had strewn afar. And Athelvok turned and set one foot upon the\r\ncrumbled slope, and then another, and walked a little way to be nearer to\r\nthe Sea, and then a dream came upon him and he felt that men had wronged\r\nthe lovely Sea because he had been angry a little, because he had been\r\nsometimes cruel; he felt that there was trouble among the tides of the Sea\r\nbecause he had loved the galleons who were dead. Still he walked on and\r\nthe crumbled stones rolled with him, and just as the twilight faded and a\r\nstar appeared he came to the golden shore, and walked on till the surges\r\nwere about his knees, and he heard the prayer-like blessings of the Sea.\r\nLong he stood thus, while the stars came out above him and shone again in\r\nthe surges; more stars came wheeling in their courses up from the Sea,\r\nlights twinkled out through all the haven city, lanterns were slung from\r\nthe ships, the purple night burned on; and Earth, to the eyes of the gods\r\nas they sat afar, glowed as with one flame. Then Athelvok went into the\r\nhaven city; there he met many who had left the Inner Lands before him;\r\nnone of them wished to return to the people who had not seen the Sea; many\r\nof them had forgotten the three little kingdoms, and it was rumoured that\r\none man, who had once tried to return, had found the shifting, crumbled\r\nslope impossible to climb.\r\n\r\nHilnaric never married. But her dowry was set aside to build a temple\r\nwherein men curse the ocean.\r\n\r\nOnce every year, with solemn rite and ceremony, they curse the tides of\r\nthe Sea; and the moon looks in and hates them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLAGDAROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a waste place strewn with bricks in the outskirts of a town twilight\r\nwas falling. A star or two appeared over the smoke, and distant windows\r\nlit mysterious lights. The stillness deepened and the loneliness. Then all\r\nthe outcast things that are silent by day found voices.\r\n\r\nAn old cork spoke first. He said: "I grew in Andalusian woods, but never\r\nlistened to the idle songs of Spain. I only grew strong in the sunlight\r\nwaiting for my destiny. One day the merchants came and took us all away\r\nand carried us all along the shore of the sea, piled high on the backs of\r\ndonkeys, and in a town by the sea they made me into the shape that I am\r\nnow. One day they sent me northward to Provence, and there I fulfilled my\r\ndestiny. For they set me as a guard over the bubbling wine, and I\r\nfaithfully stood sentinel for twenty years. For the first few years in the\r\nbottle that I guarded the wine slept, dreaming of Provence; but as the\r\nyears went on he grew stronger and stronger, until at last whenever a man\r\nwent by the wind would put out all his might against me, saying, \'Let me\r\ngo free; let me go free!\' And every year his strength increased, and he\r\ngrew more clamourous when men went by, but never availed to hurl me from\r\nmy post. But when I had powerfully held him for twenty years they brought\r\nhim to the banquet and took me from my post, and the wine arose rejoicing\r\nand leapt through the veins of men and exalted their souls within them\r\ntill they stood up in their places and sang Proven\xe7al songs. But me they\r\ncast away--me that had been sentinel for twenty years, and was still as\r\nstrong and staunch as when first I went on guard. Now I am an outcast in a\r\ncold northern city, who once have known the Andalusian skies and guarded\r\nlong ago Proven\xe7al suns that swam in the heart of the rejoicing wine."\r\n\r\nAn unstruck match that somebody had dropped spoke next. "I am a child of\r\nthe sun," he said, "and an enemy of cities; there is more in my heart than\r\nyou know of. I am a brother of Etna and Stromboli; I have fires lurking in\r\nme that will one day rise up beautiful and strong. We will not go into\r\nservitude on any hearth nor work machines for our food, but we will take\r\nout own food where we find it on that day when we are strong. There are\r\nwonderful children in my heart whose faces shall be more lively than the\r\nrainbow; they shall make a compact with the North wind, and he shall lead\r\nthem forth; all shall be black behind them and black above them, and there\r\nshall be nothing beautiful in the world but them; they shall seize upon\r\nthe earth and it shall be theirs, and nothing shall stop them but our old\r\nenemy the sea."\r\n\r\nThen an old broken kettle spoke, and said: "I am the friend of cities. I\r\nsit among the slaves upon the hearth, the little flames that have been fed\r\nwith coal. When the slaves dance behind the iron bars I sit in the middle\r\nof the dance and sing and make our masters glad. And I make songs about\r\nthe comfort of the cat, and about the malice that is towards her in the\r\nheart of the dog, and about the crawling of the baby, and about the ease\r\nthat is in the lord of the house when we brew the good brown tea; and\r\nsometimes when the house is very warm and slaves and masters are glad, I\r\nrebuke the hostile winds that prowl about the world."\r\n\r\nAnd then there spoke the piece of an old cord. "I was made in a place of\r\ndoom, and doomed men made my fibres, working without hope. Therefore there\r\ncame a grimness into my heart, so that I never let anything go free when\r\nonce I was set to bind it. Many a thing have I bound relentlessly for\r\nmonths and years; for I used to come coiling into warehouses where the\r\ngreat boxes lay all open to the air, and one of them would be suddenly\r\nclosed up, and my fearful strength would be set on him like accurse, and\r\nif his timbers groaned when first I seized them, or if they creaked aloud\r\nin the lonely night, thinking of woodlands out of which they came, then I\r\nonly gripped them tighter still, for the poor useless hate is in my soul\r\nof those that made me in the place of doom. Yet, for all the things that\r\nmy prison-clutch has held, the last work that I did was to set something\r\nfree. I lay idle one night in the gloom on the warehouse floor. Nothing\r\nstirred there, and even the spider slept. Towards midnight a great flock\r\nof echoes suddenly leapt up from the wooden planks and circled round the\r\nroof. A man was coming towards me all alone. And as he came his soul was\r\nreproaching him, and I saw that there was a great trouble between the man\r\nand his soul, for his soul would not let him be, but went on reproaching\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Then the man saw me and said, \'This at least will not fail me.\' When I\r\nheard him say this about me, I determined that whatever he might require\r\nof me it should be done to the uttermost. And as I made this determination\r\nin my unfaltering heart, he picked me up and stood on an empty box that I\r\nshould have bound on the morrow, and tied one end of me to a dark rafter;\r\nand the knot was carelessly tied, because his soul was reproaching him all\r\nthe while continually and giving him no ease. Then he made the other end\r\nof me into a noose, but when the man\'s soul saw this it stopped\r\nreproaching the man, and cried out to him hurriedly, and besought him to\r\nbe at peace with it and to do nothing sudden; but the man went on with his\r\nwork, and put the noose down over his face and underneath his chin, and\r\nthe soul screamed horribly.\r\n\r\n"Then the man kicked the box away with his foot, and the moment he did\r\nthis I knew that my strength was not great enough to hold him; but I\r\nremembered that he had said I would not fail him, and I put all my grim\r\nvigour into my fibres and held by sheer will. Then the soul shouted to me\r\nto give way, but I said:\r\n\r\n"\'No; you vexed the man.\'\r\n\r\n"Then it screamed for me to leave go of the rafter, and already I was\r\nslipping, for I only held on to it by a careless knot, but I gripped with\r\nmy prison grip and said:\r\n\r\n"\'You vexed the man.\'\r\n\r\n"And very swiftly it said other things to me, but I answered not; and at\r\nlast the soul that vexed the man that had trusted me flew away and left\r\nhim at peace. I was never able to bind things any more, for every one of\r\nmy fibres was worn and wrenched, and even my relentless heart was weakened\r\nby the struggle. Very soon afterwards I was thrown out here. I have done\r\nmy work."\r\n\r\nSo they spoke among themselves, but all the while there loomed above them\r\nthe form of an old rocking-horse complaining bitterly. He said: "I am\r\nBlagdaross. Woe is me that I should lie now an outcast among these worthy\r\nbut little people. Alas! for the days that are gathered, and alas for the\r\nGreat One that was a master and a soul to me, whose spirit is now shrunken\r\nand can never know me again, and no more ride abroad on knightly quests. I\r\nwas Bucephalus when he was Alexander, and carried him victorious as far as\r\nInd. I encountered dragons with him when he was St. George, I was the\r\nhorse of Roland fighting for Christendom, and was often Rosinante. I\r\nfought in tournays and went errant upon quests, and met Ulysses and the\r\nheroes and the fairies. Or late in the evening, just before the lamps in\r\nthe nursery were put out, he would suddenly mount me, and we would gallop\r\nthrough Africa. There we would pass by night through tropic forests, and\r\ncome upon dark rivers sweeping by, all gleaming with the eyes of\r\ncrocodiles, where the hippopotamus floated down with the stream, and\r\nmysterious craft loomed suddenly out of the dark and furtively passed\r\naway. And when we had passed through the forest lit by the fireflies we\r\nwould come to the open plains, and gallop onwards with scarlet flamingoes\r\nflying along beside us through the lands of dusky kings, with golden\r\ncrowns upon their heads and scepters in their hands, who came running out\r\nof their palaces to see us pass. Then I would wheel suddenly, and the dust\r\nflew up from my four hooves as I turned and we galloped home again, and my\r\nmaster was put to bed. And again he would ride abroad on another day till\r\nwe came to magical fortresses guarded by wizardry and overthrew the\r\ndragons at the gate, and ever came back with a princess fairer than the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n"But my master began to grow larger in his body and smaller in his soul,\r\nand then he rode more seldom upon quests. At last he saw gold and never\r\ncame again, and I was cast out here among these little people."\r\n\r\nBut while the rocking-horse was speaking two boys stole away, unnoticed by\r\ntheir parents, from a house on the edge of the waste place, and were\r\ncoming across it looking for adventures. One of them carried a broom, and\r\nwhen he saw the rocking-horse he said nothing, but broke off the handle\r\nfrom the broom and thrust it between his braces and his shirt on the left\r\nside. Then he mounted the rocking-horse, and drawing forth the broomstick,\r\nwhich was sharp and spiky at the end, said, "Saladin is in this desert\r\nwith all his paynims, and I am Coeur de Lion." After a while the other boy\r\nsaid: "Now let me kill Saladin too." But Blagdaross in his wooden heart,\r\nthat exulted with thoughts of battle, said: "I am Blagdaross yet!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MADNESS OF ANDELSPRUTZ\r\n\r\n\r\nI first saw the city of Andelsprutz on an afternoon in spring. The day was\r\nfull of sunshine as I came by the way of the fields, and all that morning\r\nI had said, "There will be sunlight on it when I see for the first time\r\nthe beautiful conquered city whose fame has so often made for me lovely\r\ndreams." Suddenly I saw its fortifications lifting out of the fields, and\r\nbehind them stood its belfries. I went in by a gate and saw its houses and\r\nstreets, and a great disappointment came upon me. For there is an air\r\nabout a city, and it has a way with it, whereby a man may recognized one\r\nfrom another at once. There are cities full of happiness and cities full\r\nof pleasure, and cities full of gloom. There are cities with their faces\r\nto heaven, and some with their faces to earth; some have a way of looking\r\nat the past and others look at the future; some notice you if you come\r\namong them, others glance at you, others let you go by. Some love the\r\ncities that are their neighbours, others are dear to the plains and to the\r\nheath; some cities are bare to the wind, others have purple cloaks and\r\nothers brown cloaks, and some are clad in white. Some tell the old tale of\r\ntheir infancy, with others it is secret; some cities sing and some mutter,\r\nsome are angry, and some have broken hearts, and each city has her way of\r\ngreeting Time.\r\n\r\nI had said: "I will see Andelsprutz arrogant with her beauty," and I had\r\nsaid: "I will see her weeping over her conquest."\r\n\r\nI had said: "She will sing songs to me," and "she will be reticent," "she\r\nwill be all robed," and "she will be bare but splendid."\r\n\r\nBut the windows of Andelsprutz in her houses looked vacantly over the\r\nplains like the eyes of a dead madman. At the hour her chimes sounded\r\nunlovely and discordant, some of them were out of tune, and the bells of\r\nsome were cracked, her roofs were bald and without moss. At evening no\r\npleasant rumour arose in her streets. When the lamps were lit in the\r\nhouses no mystical flood of light stole out into the dusk, you merely saw\r\nthat there were lighted lamps; Andelsprutz had no way with her and no air\r\nabout her. When the night fell and the blinds were all drawn down, then I\r\nperceived what I had not thought in the daylight. I knew then that\r\nAndelsprutz was dead.\r\n\r\nI saw a fair-haired man who drank beer in a caf\xe9, and I said to him:\r\n\r\n"Why is the city of Andelsprutz quite dead, and her soul gone hence?"\r\n\r\nHe answered: "Cities do not have souls and there is never any life in\r\nbricks."\r\n\r\nAnd I said to him: "Sir, you have spoken truly."\r\n\r\nAnd I asked the same question of another man, and he gave me the same\r\nanswer, and I thanked him for his courtesy. And I saw a man of a more\r\nslender build, who had black hair, and channels in his cheeks for tears to\r\nrun in, and I said to him:\r\n\r\n"Why is Andelsprutz quite dead, and when did her soul go hence?"\r\n\r\nAnd he answered: "Andelsprutz hoped too much. For thirty years would she\r\nstretch out her arms toward the land of Akla every night, to Mother Akla\r\nfrom whom she had been stolen. Every night she would be hoping and\r\nsighing, and stretching out her arms to Mother Akla. At midnight, once a\r\nyear, on the anniversary of the terrible day, Akla would send spies to lay\r\na wreath against the walls of Andelsprutz. She could do no more. And on\r\nthis night, once in every year, I used to weep, for weeping was the mood\r\nof the city that nursed me. Every night while other cities slept did\r\nAndelsprutz sit brooding here and hoping, till thirty wreaths lay\r\nmouldering by her walls, and still the armies of Akla could not come.\r\n\r\n"But after she had hoped so long, and on the night that faithful spies had\r\nbrought her thirtieth wreath, Andelsprutz went suddenly mad. All the bells\r\nclanged hideously in the belfries, horses bolted in the streets, the dogs\r\nall howled, the stolid conquerors awoke and turned in their beds and slept\r\nagain; and I saw the grey shadowy form of Andelsprutz rise up, decking her\r\nhair with the phantasms of cathedrals, and stride away from her city. And\r\nthe great shadowy form that was the soul of Andelsprutz went away\r\nmuttering to the mountains, and there I followed her--for had she not been\r\nmy nurse? Yes, I went away alone into the mountains, and for three days,\r\nwrapped in a cloak, I slept in their misty solitudes. I had no food to\r\neat, and to drink I had only the water of the mountain streams. By day no\r\nliving thing was near to me, and I heard nothing but the noise of the\r\nwind, and the mountain streams roaring. But for three nights I heard all\r\nround me on the mountain the sounds of a great city: I saw the lights of\r\ntall cathedral windows flash momentarily on the peaks, and at times the\r\nglimmering lantern of some fortress patrol. And I saw the huge misty\r\noutline of the soul of Andelsprutz sitting decked with her ghostly\r\ncathedrals, speaking to herself, with her eyes fixed before her in a mad\r\nstare, telling of ancient wars. And her confused speech for all those\r\nnights upon the mountain was sometimes the voice of traffic, and then of\r\nchurch bells, and then of bugles, but oftenest it was the voice of red\r\nwar; and it was all incoherent, and she was quite mad.\r\n\r\n"The third night it rained heavily all night long, but I stayed up there\r\nto watch the soul of my native city. And she still sat staring straight\r\nbefore her, raving; but here voice was gentler now, there were more chimes\r\nin it, and occasional song. Midnight passed, and the rain still swept down\r\non me, and still the solitudes of the mountain were full of the mutterings\r\nof the poor mad city. And the hours after midnight came, the cold hours\r\nwherein sick men die.\r\n\r\n"Suddenly I was aware of great shapes moving in the rain, and heard the\r\nsound of voices that were not of my city nor yet of any that I ever knew.\r\nAnd presently I discerned, though faintly, the souls of a great concourse\r\nof cities, all bending over Andelsprutz and comforting her, and the\r\nravines of the mountains roared that night with the voices of cities that\r\nhad lain still for centuries. For there came the soul of Camelot that had\r\nso long ago forsaken Usk; and there was Ilion, all girt with towers, still\r\ncursing the sweet face of ruinous Helen; I saw there Babylon and\r\nPersepolis, and the bearded face of bull-like Nineveh, and Athens mourning\r\nher immortal gods.\r\n\r\n"All these souls if cities that were dead spoke that night on the mountain\r\nto my city and soothed her, until at last she muttered of war no longer,\r\nand her eyes stared wildly no more, but she hid her face in her hands and\r\nfor some while wept softly. At last she arose, and walking slowly and with\r\nbended head, and leaning upon Ilion and Carthage, went mournfully\r\neastwards; and the dust of her highways swirled behind her as she went, a\r\nghostly dust that never turned to mud in all that drenching rain. And so\r\nthe souls of the cities led her away, and gradually they disappeared from\r\nthe mountain, and the ancient voices died away in the distance.\r\n\r\n"Now since then have I seen my city alive; but once I met with a traveler\r\nwho said that somewhere in the midst of a great desert are gathered\r\ntogether the souls of all dead cities. He said that he was lost once in a\r\nplace where there was no water, and he heard their voices speaking all the\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nBut I said: "I was once without water in a desert and heard a city\r\nspeaking to me, but knew not whether it really spoke to me or not, for on\r\nthat day I heard so many terrible things, and only some of them were\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\nAnd the man with the black hair said: "I believe it to be true, though\r\nwhither she went I know not. I only know that a shepherd found me in the\r\nmorning faint with hunger and cold, and carried me down here; and when I\r\ncame to Andelsprutz it was, as you have perceived it, dead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE THE TIDES EBB AND FLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nI dreamt that I had done a horrible thing, so that burial was to be denied\r\nme either in soil or sea, neither could there be any hell for me.\r\n\r\nI waited for some hours, knowing this. Then my friends came for me, and\r\nslew me secretly and with ancient rite, and lit great tapers, and carried\r\nme away.\r\n\r\nIt was all in London that the thing was done, and they went furtively at\r\ndead of night along grey streets and among mean houses until they came to\r\nthe river. And the river and the tide of the sea were grappling with one\r\nanother between the mud-banks, and both of them were black and full of\r\nlights. A sudden wonder came in to the eyes of each, as my friends came\r\nnear to them with their glaring tapers. All these things I saw as they\r\ncarried me dead and stiffening, for my soul was still among my bones,\r\nbecause there was no hell for it, and because Christian burial was denied\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThey took me down a stairway that was green with slimy things, and so came\r\nslowly to the terrible mud. There, in the territory of forsaken things,\r\nthey dug a shallow grave. When they had finished they laid me in the\r\ngrave, and suddenly they cast their tapers to the river. And when the\r\nwater had quenched the flaring lights the tapers looked pale and small as\r\nthey bobbed upon the tide, and at once the glamour of the calamity was\r\ngone, and I noticed then the approach of the huge dawn; and my friends\r\ncast their cloaks over their faces, and the solemn procession was turned\r\ninto many fugitives that furtively stole away.\r\n\r\nThen the mud came back wearily and covered all but my face. There I lay\r\nalone with quite forgotten things, with drifting things that the tides\r\nwill take no farther, with useless things and lost things, and with the\r\nhorrible unnatural bricks that are neither stone nor soil. I was rid of\r\nfeeling, because I had been killed, but perception and thought were in my\r\nunhappy soul. The dawn widened, and I saw the desolate houses that crowded\r\nthe marge of the river, and their dead windows peered into my dead eyes,\r\nwindows with bales behind them instead of human souls. I grew so weary\r\nlooking at these forlorn things that I wanted to cry out, but could not,\r\nbecause I was dead. Then I knew, as I had never known before, that for all\r\nthe years that herd of desolate houses had wanted to cry out too, but,\r\nbeing dead, were dumb. And I knew then that it had yet been well with the\r\nforgotten drifting things if they had wept, but they were eyeless and\r\nwithout life. And I, too, tried to weep, but there were no tears in my\r\ndead eyes. And I knew then that the river might have cared for us, might\r\nhave caressed us, might have sung to us, but he swept broadly onwards,\r\nthinking of nothing but the princely ships.\r\n\r\nAt last the tide did what the river would not, and came and covered me\r\nover, and my soul had rest in the green water, and rejoiced and believed\r\nthat it had the Burial of the Sea. But with the ebb the water fell again,\r\nand left me alone again with the callous mud among the forgotten things\r\nthat drift no more, and with the sight of all those desolate houses, and\r\nwith the knowledge among all of us that each was dead.\r\n\r\nIn the mournful wall behind me, hung with green weeds, forsaken of the\r\nsea, dark tunnels appeared, and secret narrow passages that were clamped\r\nand barred. From these at last the stealthy rats came down to nibble me\r\naway, and my soul rejoiced thereat and believed that he would be free\r\nperforce from the accursed bones to which burial was refused. Very soon\r\nthe rats ran away a little space and whispered among themselves. They\r\nnever came any more. When I found that I was accursed even among the rats\r\nI tried to weep again.\r\n\r\nThen the tide came swinging back and covered the dreadful mud, and hid the\r\ndesolate houses, and soothed the forgotten things, and my soul had ease\r\nfor a while in the sepulture of the sea. And then the tide forsook me\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTo and fro it came about me for many years. Then the County Council found\r\nme, and gave me decent burial. It was the first grave that I had ever\r\nslept in. That very night my friends came for me. They dug me up and put\r\nme back again in the shallow hold in the mud.\r\n\r\nAgain and again through the years my bones found burial, but always behind\r\nthe funeral lurked one of those terrible men who, as soon as night fell,\r\ncame and dug them up and carried them back again to the hole in the mud.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day the last of those men died who once had done to me this\r\nterrible thing. I heard his soul go over the river at sunset.\r\n\r\nAnd again I hoped.\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards I was found once more, and once more taken out of\r\nthat restless place and given deep burial in sacred ground, where my soul\r\nhoped that it should rest.\r\n\r\nAlmost at once men came with cloaks and tapers to give me back to the mud,\r\nfor the thing had become a tradition and a rite. And all the forsaken\r\nthings mocked me in their dumb hearts when they saw me carried back, for\r\nthey were jealous of me because I had left the mud. It must be remembered\r\nthat I could not weep.\r\n\r\nAnd the years went by seawards where the black barges go, and the great\r\nderelict centuries became lost at sea, and still I lay there without any\r\ncause to hope, and daring not to hope without a cause, because of the\r\nterrible envy and the anger of the things that could drift no more.\r\n\r\nOnce a great storm rode up, even as far as London, out of the sea from the\r\nSouth; and he came curving into the river with the fierce East wind. And\r\nhe was mightier than the dreary tides, and went with great leaps over the\r\nlistless mud. And all the sad forgotten things rejoiced, and mingled with\r\nthings that were haughtier than they, and rode once more amongst the\r\nlordly shipping that was driven up and down. And out of their hideous home\r\nhe took my bones, never again, I hoped, to be vexed with the ebb and flow.\r\nAnd with the fall of the tide he went riding down the river and turned to\r\nthe southwards, and so went to his home. And my bones he scattered among\r\nmany isles and along the shores of happy alien mainlands. And for a\r\nmoment, while they were far asunder, my soul was almost free.\r\n\r\nThen there arose, at the will of the moon, the assiduous flow of the tide,\r\nand it undid at once the work of the ebb, and gathered my bones from the\r\nmarge of sunny isles, and gleaned them all along the mainland\'s shores,\r\nand went rocking northwards till it came to the mouth of the Thames, and\r\nthere turned westwards its relentless face, and so went up the river and\r\ncame to the hole in the mud, and into it dropped my bones; and partly the\r\nmud covered them, and partly it left them white, for the mud cares not for\r\nits forsaken things.\r\n\r\nThen the ebb came, and I saw the dead eyes of the houses and the jealousy\r\nof the other forgotten things that the storm had not carried thence.\r\n\r\nAnd some more centuries passed over the ebb and flow and over the\r\nloneliness of things for gotten. And I lay there all the while in the\r\ncareless grip of the mud, never wholly covered, yet never able to go free,\r\nand I longed for the great caress of the warm Earth or the comfortable lap\r\nof the Sea.\r\n\r\nSometimes men found my bones and buried them, but the tradition never\r\ndied, and my friends\' successors always brought them back. At last the\r\nbarges went no more, and there were fewer lights; shaped timbers no longer\r\nfloated down the fairway, and there came instead old wind-uprooted trees\r\nin all their natural simplicity.\r\n\r\nAt last I was aware that somewhere near me a blade of grass was growing,\r\nand the moss began to appear all over the dead houses. One day some\r\nthistledown went drifting over the river.\r\n\r\nFor some years I watched these signs attentively, until I became certain\r\nthat London was passing away. Then I hoped once more, and all along both\r\nbanks of the river there was anger among the lost things that anything\r\nshould dare to hope upon the forsaken mud. Gradually the horrible houses\r\ncrumbled, until the poor dead things that never had had life got decent\r\nburial among the weeds and moss. At last the may appeared and the\r\nconvolvulus. Finally, the wild rose stood up over mounds that had been\r\nwharves and warehouses. Then I knew that the cause of Nature had\r\ntriumphed, and London had passed away.\r\n\r\nThe last man in London came to the wall by the river, in an ancient cloak\r\nthat was one of those that once my friends had worn, and peered over the\r\nedge to see that I still was there. Then he went, and I never saw men\r\nagain: they had passed away with London.\r\n\r\nA few days after the last man had gone the birds came into London, all the\r\nbirds that sing. When they first saws me they all looked sideways at me,\r\nthen they went away a little and spoke among themselves.\r\n\r\n"He only sinned against Man," they said; "it is not our quarrel."\r\n\r\n"Let us be kind to him," they said.\r\n\r\nThen they hopped nearer me and began to sing. It was the time of the\r\nrising of the dawn, and from both banks of the river, and from the sky,\r\nand from the thickets that were once the streets, hundreds of birds were\r\nsinging. As the light increased the birds sang more and more; they grew\r\nthicker and thicker in the air above my head, till there were thousands of\r\nthem singing there, and then millions, and at last I could see nothing but\r\na host of flickering wings with the sunlight on them, and little gaps of\r\nsky. Then when there was nothing to be heard in London but the myriad\r\nnotes of that exultant song, my soul rose up from the bones in the hole in\r\nthe mud and began to climb heavenwards. And it seemed that a lane-way\r\nopened amongst the wings of the birds, and it went up and up, and one of\r\nthe smaller gates of Paradise stood ajar at the end of it. And then I knew\r\nby a sign that the mud should receive me no more, for suddenly I found\r\nthat I could weep.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I opened my eyes in bed in a house in London, and outside\r\nsome sparrows were twittering in a tree in the light of the radiant\r\nmorning; and there were tears still wet upon my face, for one\'s restraint\r\nis feeble while one sleeps. But I arose and opened the window wide, and\r\nstretching my hands out over the little garden, I blessed the birds whose\r\nsong had woken me up from the troubled and terrible centuries of my dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETHMOORA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a faint freshness in the London night as though some strayed\r\nreveler of a breeze had left his comrades in the Kentish uplands and had\r\nentered the town by stealth. The pavements are a little damp and shiny.\r\nUpon one\'s ears that at this late hour have become very acute there hits\r\nthe tap of a remote footfall. Louder and louder grow the taps, filling the\r\nwhole night. And a black cloaked figure passes by, and goes tapping into\r\nthe dark. One who has danced goes homewards. Somewhere a ball has closed\r\nits doors and ended. Its yellow lights are out, its musicians are silent,\r\nits dancers have all gone into the night air, and Time has said of it,\r\n"Let it be past and over, and among the things that I have put away."\r\n\r\nShadows begin to detach themselves from their great gathering places. No\r\nless silently than those shadows that are thin and dead move homewards the\r\nstealthy cats. Thus have we even in London our faint forebodings of the\r\ndawn\'s approach, which the birds and the beasts and the stars are crying\r\naloud to the untrammeled fields.\r\n\r\nAt what moment I know not I perceive that the night itself is irrevocably\r\noverthrown. It is suddenly revealed to me by the weary pallor of the\r\nstreet lamps that the streets are silent and nocturnal still, not because\r\nthere is any strength in night, but because men have not yet arisen from\r\nsleep to defy him. So have I seen dejected and untidy guards still bearing\r\nantique muskets in palatial gateways, although the realms of the monarch\r\nthat they guard have shrunk to a single province which no enemy yet has\r\ntroubled to overrun.\r\n\r\nAnd it is now manifest from the aspect of the street lamps, those abashed\r\ndependants of night, that already English mountain peaks have seen the\r\ndawn, that the cliffs of Dover are standing white to the morning, that the\r\nsea-mist has lifted and is pouring inland.\r\n\r\nAnd now men with a hose have come and are sluicing out the streets.\r\n\r\nBehold now night is dead.\r\n\r\nWhat memories, what fancies throng one\'s mind! A night but just now\r\ngathered out of London by the horrific hand of Time. A million common\r\nartificial things all cloaked for a while in mystery, like beggars robed\r\nin purple, and seated on dread thrones. Four million people asleep,\r\ndreaming perhaps. What worlds have they gone into? Whom have they met? But\r\nmy thoughts are far off with Bethmoora in her loneliness, whose gates\r\nswing to and fro. To and fro they swing, and creak and creak in the wind,\r\nbut no one hears them. They are of green copper, very lovely, but no one\r\nsees them now. The desert wind pours sand into their hinges, no watchman\r\ncomes to ease them. No guard goes round Bethmoora\'s battlements, no enemy\r\nassails them. There are no lights in her houses, no footfall on her\r\nstreets, she stands there dead and lonely beyond the Hills of Hap, and I\r\nwould see Bethmoora once again, but dare not.\r\n\r\nIt is many a year, they tell me, since Bethmoora became desolate.\r\n\r\nHer desolation is spoken of in taverns where sailors meet, and certain\r\ntravellers have told me of it.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to see Bethmoora once again. It is many a year ago, they say,\r\nwhen the vintage was last gathered in from the vineyards that I knew,\r\nwhere it is all desert now. It was a radiant day, and the people of the\r\ncity were dancing by the vineyards, while here and there one played upon\r\nthe kalipac. The purple flowering shrubs were all in bloom, and the snow\r\nshone upon the Hills of Hap.\r\n\r\nOutside the copper gates they crushed the grapes in vats to make the\r\nsyrabub. It had been a goodly vintage.\r\n\r\nIn the little gardens at the desert\'s edge men beat the tambang and the\r\ntittibuk, and blew melodiously the zootibar.\r\n\r\nAll there was mirth and song and dance, because the vintage had been\r\ngathered in, and there would be ample syrabub for the winter months, and\r\nmuch left over to exchange for turquoises and emeralds with the merchants\r\nwho come down from Oxuhahn. Thus they rejoiced all day over their vintage\r\non the narrow strip of cultivated ground that lay between Bethmoora and\r\nthe desert which meets the sky to the South. And when the heat of the day\r\nbegan to abate, and the sun drew near to the snows on the Hills of Hap,\r\nthe note of the zootibar still rose clear from the gardens, and the\r\nbrilliant dresses of the dancers still wound among the flowers. All that\r\nday three men on mules had been noticed crossing the face of the Hills of\r\nHap. Backwards and forwards they moved as the track wound lower and lower,\r\nthree little specks of black against the snow. They were seen first in the\r\nvery early morning up near the shoulder of Peol Jagganoth, and seemed to\r\nbe coming out of Utnar V\xe9hi. All day they came. And in the evening, just\r\nbefore the lights come out and colours change, they appeared before\r\nBethmoora\'s copper gates. They carried staves, such as messengers bear in\r\nthose lands, and seemed sombrely clad when the dancers all came round them\r\nwith their green and lilac dresses. Those Europeans who were present and\r\nheard the message given were ignorant of the language, and only caught the\r\nname of Utnar V\xe9hi. But it was brief, and passed rapidly from mouth to\r\nmouth, and almost at once the people burnt their vineyards and began to\r\nflee away from Bethmoora, going for the most part northwards, though some\r\nwent to the East. They ran down out of their fair white houses, and\r\nstreamed through the copper gate; the throbbing of the tambang and the\r\ntittibuk suddenly ceased with the note of the Zootibar, and the clinking\r\nkalipac stopped a moment after. The three strange travellers went back the\r\nway they came the instant their message was given. It was the hour when a\r\nlight would have appeared in some high tower, and window after window\r\nwould have poured into the dusk its lion-frightening light, and the cooper\r\ngates would have been fastened up. But no lights came out in windows there\r\nthat night and have not ever since, and those copper gates were left wide\r\nand have never shut, and the sound arose of the red fire crackling in the\r\nvineyards, and the pattering of feet fleeing softly. There were no cries,\r\nno other sounds at all, only the rapid and determined flight. They fled as\r\nswiftly and quietly as a herd of wild cattle flee when they suddenly see a\r\nman. It was as though something had befallen which had been feared for\r\ngenerations, which could only be escaped by instant flight, which left no\r\ntime for indecision.\r\n\r\nThen fear took the Europeans also, and they too fled. And what the message\r\nwas I have never heard.\r\n\r\nMany believe that it was a message from Thuba Mleen, the mysterious\r\nemperor of those lands, who is never seen by man, advising that Bethmoora\r\nshould be left desolate. Others say that the message was one of warning\r\nfrom the gods, whether from friendly gods or from adverse ones they know\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAnd others hold that the Plague was ravaging a line of cities over in\r\nUtnar V\xe9hi, following the South-west wind which for many weeks had been\r\nblowing across them towards Bethmoora.\r\n\r\nSome say that the terrible gnousar sickness was upon the three travellers,\r\nand that their very mules were dripping with it, and suppose that they\r\nwere driven to the city by hunger, but suggest no better reason for so\r\nterrible a crime.\r\n\r\nBut most believe that it was a message from the desert himself, who owns\r\nall the Earth to the southwards, spoken with his peculiar cry to those\r\nthree who knew his voice--men who had been out on the sand-wastes without\r\ntents by night, who had been by day without water, men who had been out\r\nthere where the desert mutters, and had grown to know his needs and his\r\nmalevolence. They say that the desert had a need for Bethmoora, that he\r\nwished to come into her lovely streets, and to send into her temples and\r\nher houses his storm-winds draped with sand. For he hates the sound and\r\nthe sight of men in his old evil heart, and he would have Bethmoora silent\r\nand undisturbed, save for the weird love he whispers to her gates.\r\n\r\nIf I knew what that message was that the three men brought on mules, and\r\ntold in the copper gate, I think that I should go and see Bethmoora once\r\nagain. For a great longing comes on me here in London to see once more\r\nthat white and beautiful city, and yet I dare not, for I know not the\r\ndanger I should have to face, whether I should risk the fury of unknown\r\ndreadful gods, or some disease unspeakable and slow, or the desert\'s curse\r\nor torture in some little private room of the Emperor Thuba Mleen, or\r\nsomething that the travelers have not told--perhaps more fearful still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDLE DAYS ON THE YANN\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I came down through the wood on the bank of Yann and found, as had been\r\nprophesied, the ship _Bird of the River_ about to loose her cable.\r\n\r\nThe captain sat cross-legged upon the white deck with his scimitar lying\r\nbeside him in its jeweled scabbard, and the sailors toiled to spread the\r\nnimble sails to bring the ship into the central stream of Yann, and all\r\nthe while sang ancient soothing songs. And the wind of the evening\r\ndescending cool from the snowfields of some mountainous abode of distant\r\ngods came suddenly, like glad tidings to an anxious city, into the\r\nwing-like sails.\r\n\r\nAnd so we came into the central stream, whereat the sailors lowered the\r\ngreater sails. But I had gone to bow before the captain, and to inquire\r\nconcerning the miracles, and appearances among men, of the most holy gods\r\nof whatever land he had come from. And the captain answered that he came\r\nfrom fair Belzoond, and worshipped gods that were the least and humblest,\r\nwho seldom sent the famine or the thunder, and were easily appeased with\r\nlittle battles. And I told how I came from Ireland, which is of Europe,\r\nwhereat the captain and all the sailors laughed, for they said, "There are\r\nno such places in all the land of dreams." When they had ceased to mock\r\nme, I explained that my fancy mostly dwelt in the desert of Cuppar-Nombo,\r\nabout a beautiful blue city called Golthoth the Damned, which was\r\nsentinelled all round by wolves and their shadows, and had been utterly\r\ndesolate for years and years, because of a curse which the gods once spoke\r\nin anger and could never since recall. And sometimes my dreams took me as\r\nfar as Pungar Vees, the red walled city where the fountains are, which\r\ntrades with the Isles and Thul. When I said this they complimented me upon\r\nthe abode of my fancy, saying that, though they had never seen these\r\ncities, such places might well be imagined. For the rest of that evening I\r\nbargained with the captain over the sum that I should pay him for any fare\r\nif God and the tide of Yann should bring us safely as far as the cliffs by\r\nthe sea, which are named Bar-Wul-Yann, the Gate of Yann.\r\n\r\nAnd now the sun had set, and all the colours of the world and heaven had\r\nheld a festival with him, and slipped one by one away before the imminent\r\napproach of night. The parrots had all flown home to the jungle on either\r\nbank, the monkeys in rows in safety on high branches of the trees were\r\nsilent and asleep, the fireflies in the deeps of the forest were going up\r\nand down, and the great stars came gleaming out to look on the face of\r\nYann. Then the sailors lighted lanterns and hung them round the ship, and\r\nthe light flashed out on a sudden and dazzled Yann, and the ducks that fed\r\nalong his marshy banks all suddenly arose, and made wide circles in the\r\nupper air, and saw the distant reaches of the Yann and the white mist that\r\nsoftly cloaked the jungle, before they returned again to their marshes.\r\n\r\nAnd then the sailors knelt on the decks and prayed, not all together, but\r\nfive or six at a time. Side by side there kneeled down together five or\r\nsix, for there only prayed at the same time men of different faiths, so\r\nthat no god should hear two men praying to him at once. As soon as any one\r\nhad finished his prayer, another of the same faith would take his place.\r\nThus knelt the row of five or six with bended heads under the fluttering\r\nsail, while the central stream of the River Yann took them on towards the\r\nsea, and their prayers rose up from among the lanterns and went towards\r\nthe stars. And behind them in the after end of the ship the helmsman\r\nprayed aloud the helmsman\'s prayer, which is prayed by all who follow his\r\ntrade upon the River Yann, of whatever faith they be. And the captain\r\nprayed to his little lesser gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.\r\n\r\nAnd I too felt that I would pray. Yet I liked not to pray to a jealous God\r\nthere where the frail affectionate gods whom the heathen love were being\r\nhumbly invoked; so I bethought me, instead, of Sheol Nugganoth, whom the\r\nmen of the jungle have long since deserted, who is now unworshipped and\r\nalone; and to him I prayed.\r\n\r\nAnd upon us praying the night came suddenly down, as it comes upon all men\r\nwho pray at evening and upon all men who do not; yet our prayers comforted\r\nour own souls when we thought of the Great Night to come.\r\n\r\nAnd so Yann bore us magnificently onwards, for he was elate with molten\r\nsnow that the Poltiades had brought him from the Hills of Hap, and the\r\nMarn and Migris were swollen with floods; and he bore us in his full might\r\npast Kyph and Pir, and we saw the lights of Goolunza.\r\n\r\nSoon we all slept except the helmsman, who kept the ship in the mid-stream\r\nof Yann.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose the helmsman ceased to sing, for by song he cheered\r\nhimself in the lonely night. When the song ceased we suddenly all awoke,\r\nand another took the helm, and the helmsman slept.\r\n\r\nWe knew that soon we should come to Mandaroon. We made a meal, and\r\nMandaroon appeared. Then the captain commanded, and the sailors loosed\r\nagain the greater sails, and the ship turned and left the stream of Yann\r\nand came into a harbour beneath the ruddy walls of Mandaroon. Then while\r\nthe sailors went and gathered fruits I came alone to the gate of\r\nMandaroon. A few huts were outside it, in which lived the guard. A\r\nsentinel with a long white beard was standing in the gate, armed with a\r\nrusty pike. He wore large spectacles, which were covered with dust.\r\nThrough the gate I saw the city. A deathly stillness was over all of it.\r\nThe ways seemed untrodden, and moss was thick on doorsteps; in the\r\nmarket-place huddled figures lay asleep. A scent of incense came wafted\r\nthrough the gateway, of incense and burned poppies, and there was a hum of\r\nthe echoes of distant bells. I said to the sentinel in the tongue of the\r\nregion of Yann, "Why are they all asleep in this still city?"\r\n\r\nHe answered: "None may ask questions in this gate for fear they will wake\r\nthe people of the city. For when the people of this city wake the gods\r\nwill die. And when the gods die men may dream no more." And I began to ask\r\nhim what gods that city worshipped, but he lifted his pike because none\r\nmight ask questions there. So I left him and went back to the _Bird of the\r\nRiver_.\r\n\r\nCertainly Mandaroon was beautiful with her white pinnacles peering over\r\nher ruddy walls and the green of her copper roofs.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back again to the _Bird of the River_, I found the sailors\r\nwere returned to the ship. Soon we weighed anchor, and sailed out again,\r\nand so came once more to the middle of the river. And now the sun was\r\nmoving toward his heights, and there had reached us on the River Yann the\r\nsong of those countless myriads of choirs that attend him in his progress\r\nround the world. For the little creatures that have many legs had spread\r\ntheir gauze wings easily on the air, as a man rests his elbows on a\r\nbalcony and gave jubilant, ceremonial praises to the sun, or else they\r\nmoved together on the air in wavering dances intricate and swift, or\r\nturned aside to avoid the onrush of some drop of water that a breeze had\r\nshaken from a jungle orchid, chilling the air and driving it before it, as\r\nit fell whirring in its rush to the earth; but all the while they sang\r\ntriumphantly. "For the day is for us," they said, "whether our great and\r\nsacred father the Sun shall bring up more life like us from the marshes,\r\nor whether all the world shall end tonight." And there sang all those\r\nwhose notes are known to human ears, as well as those whose far more\r\nnumerous notes have been never heard by man.\r\n\r\nTo these a rainy day had been as an era of war that should desolate\r\ncontinents during all the lifetime of a man.\r\n\r\nAnd there came out also from the dark and steaming jungle to behold and\r\nrejoice in the Sun the huge and lazy butterflies. And they danced, but\r\ndanced idly, on the ways of the air, as some haughty queen of distant\r\nconquered lands might in her poverty and exile dance, in some encampment\r\nof the gipsies, for the mere bread to live by, but beyond that would never\r\nabate her pride to dance for a fragment more.\r\n\r\nAnd the butterflies sung of strange and painted things, of purple orchids\r\nand of lost pink cities and the monstrous colours of the jungle\'s decay.\r\nAnd they, too, were among those whose voices are not discernible by human\r\nears. And as they floated above the river, going from forest to forest,\r\ntheir splendour was matched by the inimical beauty of the birds who darted\r\nout to pursue them. Or sometimes they settled on the white and wax-like\r\nblooms of the plant that creeps and clambers about the trees of the\r\nforest; and their purple wings flashed out on the great blossoms as, when\r\nthe caravans go from Nurl to Thace, the gleaming silks flash out upon the\r\nsnow, where the crafty merchants spread them one by one to astonish the\r\nmountaineers of the Hills of Noor.\r\n\r\nBut upon men and beasts the sun sent drowsiness. The river monsters along\r\nthe river\'s marge lay dormant in the slime. The sailors pitched a\r\npavilion, with golden tassels, for the captain upon the deck, and then\r\nwent, all but the helmsman, under a sail that they had hung as an awning\r\nbetween two masts. Then they told tales to one another, each of his own\r\ncity or of the miracles of his god, until all were fallen asleep. The\r\ncaptain offered me the shade of his pavillion with the gold tassels, and\r\nthere we talked for a while, he telling me that he was taking merchandise\r\nto Perd\xf3ndaris, and that he would take back to fair Belzoond things\r\nappertaining to the affairs of the sea. Then, as I watched through the\r\npavilion\'s opening the brilliant birds and butterflies that crossed and\r\nrecrossed over the river, I fell asleep, and dreamed that I was a monarch\r\nentering his capital underneath arches of flags, and all the musicians of\r\nthe world were there, playing melodiously their instruments; but no one\r\ncheered.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, as the day grew cooler again, I awoke and found the\r\ncaptain buckling on his scimitar, which he had taken off him while he\r\nrested.\r\n\r\nAnd now we were approaching the wide court of Astahahn, which opens upon\r\nthe river. Strange boats of antique design were chained there to the\r\nsteps. As we neared it we saw the open marble court, on three sides of\r\nwhich stood the city fronting on colonnades. And in the court and along\r\nthe colonnades the people of that city walked with solemnity and care\r\naccording to the rites of ancient ceremony. All in that city was of\r\nancient device; the carving on the houses, which, when age had broken it,\r\nremained unrepaired, was of the remotest times, and everywhere were\r\nrepresented in stone beasts that have long since passed away from\r\nEarth--the dragon, the griffin, the hippogriffin, and the different\r\nspecies of gargoyle. Nothing was to be found, whether material or custom,\r\nthat was new in Astahahn. Now they took no notice at all of us as we went\r\nby, but continued their processions and ceremonies in the ancient city,\r\nand the sailors, knowing their custom, took no notice of them. But I\r\ncalled, as we came near, to one who stood beside the water\'s edge, asking\r\nhim what men did in Astahahn and what their merchandise was, and with whom\r\nthey traded. He said, "Here we have fettered and manacled Time, who would\r\notherwise slay the gods."\r\n\r\nI asked him what gods they worshipped in that city, and he said, "All\r\nthose gods whom Time has not yet slain." Then he turned from me and would\r\nsay no more, but busied himself in behaving in accordance with ancient\r\ncustom. And so, according to the will of Yann, we drifted onwards and left\r\nAstahahn. The river widened below Astahahn, and we found in greater\r\nquantities such birds as prey on fishes. And they were very wonderful in\r\ntheir plumage, and they came not out of the jungle, but flew, with their\r\nlong necks stretched out before them, and their legs lying on the wind\r\nbehind, straight up the river over the mid-stream.\r\n\r\nAnd now the evening began to gather in. A thick white mist had appeared\r\nover the river, and was softly rising higher. It clutched at the trees\r\nwith long impalpable arms, it rose higher and higher, chilling the air;\r\nand white shapes moved away into the jungle as though the ghosts of\r\nshipwrecked mariners were searching stealthily in the darkness for the\r\nspirits of evil that long ago had wrecked them on the Yann.\r\n\r\nAs the sun sank behind the field of orchids that grew on the matted summit\r\nof the jungle, the river monsters came wallowing out of the slime in which\r\nthey had reclined during the heat of the day, and the great beasts of the\r\njungle came down to drink. The butterflies a while since were gone to\r\nrest. In little narrow tributaries that we passed night seemed already to\r\nhave fallen, though the sun which had disappeared from us had not yet set.\r\n\r\nAnd now the birds of the jungle came flying home far over us, with the\r\nsunlight glistening pink upon their breasts, and lowered their pinions as\r\nsoon as they saw the Yann, and dropped into the trees. And the widgeon\r\nbegan to go up the river in great companies, all whistling, and then would\r\nsuddenly wheel and all go down again. And there shot by us the small and\r\narrow-like teal; and we heard the manifold cries of flocks of geese, which\r\nthe sailors told me had recently come in from crossing over the Lispasian\r\nranges; every year they come by the same way, close by the peak of Mluna,\r\nleaving it to the left, and the mountain eagles know the way they come\r\nand--men say--the very hour, and every year they expect them by the same\r\nway as soon as the snows have fallen upon the Northern Plains. But soon it\r\ngrew so dark that we heard those birds no more, and only heard the\r\nwhirring of their wings, and of countless others besides, until they all\r\nsettled down along the banks of the river, and it was the hour when the\r\nbirds of the night went forth. Then the sailors lit the lanterns for the\r\nnight, and huge moths appeared, flapping about the ship, and at moments\r\ntheir gorgeous colours would be revealed by the lanterns, then they would\r\npass into the night again, where all was black. And again the sailors\r\nprayed, and thereafter we supped and slept, and the helmsman took our\r\nlives into his care.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke I found that we had indeed come to Perd\xf3ndaris, that famous\r\ncity. For there it stood upon the left of us, a city fair and notable, and\r\nall the more pleasant for our eyes to see after the jungle that was so\r\nlong with us. And we were anchored by the market-place, and the captain\'s\r\nmerchandise was all displayed, and a merchant of Perd\xf3ndaris stood looking\r\nat it. And the captain had his scimitar in his hand, and was beating with\r\nit in anger upon the deck, and the splinters were flying up from the white\r\nplanks; for the merchant had offered him a price for his merchandise that\r\nthe captain declared to be an insult to himself and his country\'s gods,\r\nwhom he now said to be great and terrible gods, whose curses were to be\r\ndreaded. But the merchant waved his hands, which were of great fatness,\r\nshowing the pink palms, and swore that of himself he thought not at all,\r\nbut only of the poor folk in the huts beyond the city to whom he wished to\r\nsell the merchandise for as low a price as possible, leaving no\r\nremuneration for himself. For the merchandise was mostly the thick\r\ntoomarund carpets that in the winter keep the wind from the floor, and\r\ntollub which the people smoke in pipes. Therefore the merchant said if he\r\noffered a piffek more the poor folk must go without their toomarunds when\r\nthe winter came, and without their tollub in the evenings, or else he and\r\nhis aged father must starve together. Thereat the captain lifted his\r\nscimitar to his own throat, saying that he was now a ruined man, and that\r\nnothing remained to him but death. And while he was carefully lifting his\r\nbeard with his left hand, the merchant eyed the merchandise again, and\r\nsaid that rather than see so worthy a captain die, a man for whom he had\r\nconceived an especial love when first he saw the manner in which he\r\nhandled his ship, he and his aged father should starve together and\r\ntherefore he offered fifteen piffeks more.\r\n\r\nWhen he said this the captain prostrated himself and prayed to his gods\r\nthat they might yet sweeten this merchant\'s bitter heart--to his little\r\nlesser gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.\r\n\r\nAt last the merchant offered yet five piffeks more. Then the captain wept,\r\nfor he said that he was deserted of his gods; and the merchant also wept,\r\nfor he said that he was thinking of his aged father, and of how he soon\r\nwould starve, and he hid his weeping face with both his hands, and eyed\r\nthe tollub again between his fingers. And so the bargain was concluded,\r\nand the merchant took the toomarund and tollub, paying for them out of a\r\ngreat clinking purse. And these were packed up into bales again, and three\r\nof the merchant\'s slaves carried them upon their heads into the city. And\r\nall the while the sailors had sat silent, cross-legged in a crescent upon\r\nthe deck, eagerly watching the bargain, and now a murmur of satisfaction\r\narose among them, and they began to compare it among themselves with other\r\nbargains that they had known. And I found out from them that there are\r\nseven merchants in Perd\xf3ndaris, and that they had all come to the captain\r\none by one before the bargaining began, and each had warned him privately\r\nagainst the others. And to all the merchants the captain had offered the\r\nwine of his own country, that they make in fair Belzoond, but could in no\r\nwise persuade them to it. But now that the bargain was over, and the\r\nsailors were seated at the first meal of the day, the captain appeared\r\namong them with a cask of that wine, and we broached it with care and all\r\nmade merry together. And the captain was glad in his heart because he knew\r\nthat he had much honour in the eyes of his men because of the bargain that\r\nhe had made. So the sailors drank the wine of their native land, and soon\r\ntheir thoughts were back in fair Belzoond and the little neighbouring\r\ncities of Durl and Duz.\r\n\r\nBut for me the captain poured into a little jar some heavy yellow wine\r\nfrom a small jar which he kept apart among his sacred things. Thick and\r\nsweet it was, even like honey, yet there was in its heart a mighty, ardent\r\nfire which had authority over souls of men. It was made, the captain told\r\nme, with great subtlety by the secret craft of a family of six who lived\r\nin a hut on the mountains of Hian Min. Once in these mountains, he said,\r\nhe followed the spoor of a bear, and he came suddenly on a man of that\r\nfamily who had hunted the same bear, and he was at the end of a narrow way\r\nwith precipice all about him, and his spear was sticking in the bear, and\r\nthe wound was not fatal, and he had no other weapon. And the bear was\r\nwalking towards the man, very slowly because his wound irked him--yet he\r\nwas now very close. And what he captain did he would not say, but every\r\nyear as soon as the snows are hard, and travelling is easy on the Hian\r\nMin, that man comes down to the market in the plains, and always leaves\r\nfor the captain in the gate of fair Belzoond a vessel of that priceless\r\nsecret wine.\r\n\r\nAnd as I sipped the wine and the captain talked, I remembered me of\r\nstalwart noble things that I had long since resolutely planned, and my\r\nsoul seemed to grow mightier within me and to dominate the whole tide of\r\nthe Yann. It may be that I then slept. Or, if I did not, I do not now\r\nminutely recollect every detail of that morning\'s occupations. Towards\r\nevening, I awoke and wishing to see Perd\xf3ndaris before we left in the\r\nmorning, and being unable to wake the captain, I went ashore alone.\r\nCertainly Perd\xf3ndaris was a powerful city; it was encompassed by a wall of\r\ngreat strength and altitude, having in it hollow ways for troops to walk\r\nin, and battlements along it all the way, and fifteen strong towers on it\r\nin every mile, and copper plaques low down where men could read them,\r\ntelling in all the languages of those parts of the earth--one language on\r\neach plaque--the tale of how an army once attacked Perd\xf3ndaris and what\r\nbefell that army. Then I entered Perd\xf3ndaris and found all the people\r\ndancing, clad in brilliant silks, and playing on the tambang as they\r\ndanced. For a fearful thunderstorm had terrified them while I slept, and\r\nthe fires of death, they said, had danced over Perd\xf3ndaris, and now the\r\nthunder had gone leaping away large and black and hideous, they said, over\r\nthe distant hills, and had turned round snarling at them, shoving his\r\ngleaming teeth, and had stamped, as he went, upon the hilltops until they\r\nrang as though they had been bronze. And often and again they stopped in\r\ntheir merry dances and prayed to the God they knew not, saying, "O, God\r\nthat we know not, we thank Thee for sending the thunder back to his\r\nhills." And I went on and came to the market-place, and lying there upon\r\nthe marble pavement I saw the merchant fast asleep and breathing heavily,\r\nwith his face and the palms of his hands towards the sky, and slaves were\r\nfanning him to keep away the flies. And from the market-place I came to a\r\nsilver temple and then to a palace of onyx, and there were many wonders in\r\nPerd\xf3ndaris, and I would have stayed and seen them all, but as I came to\r\nthe outer wall of the city I suddenly saw in it a huge ivory gate. For a\r\nwhile I paused and admired it, then I came nearer and perceived the\r\ndreadful truth. The gate was carved out of one solid piece!\r\n\r\nI fled at once through the gateway and down to the ship, and even as I ran\r\nI thought that I heard far off on the hills behind me the tramp of the\r\nfearful beast by whom that mass of ivory was shed, who was perhaps even\r\nthen looking for his other tusk. When I was on the ship again I felt\r\nsafer, and I said nothing to the sailors of what I had seen.\r\n\r\nAnd now the captain was gradually awakening. Now night was rolling up from\r\nthe East and North, and only the pinnacles of the towers of Perd\xf3ndaris\r\nstill took the fallen sunlight. Then I went to the captain and told him\r\nquietly of the thing I had seen. And he questioned me at once about the\r\ngate, in a low voice, that the sailors might not know; and I told him how\r\nthe weight of the thing was such that it could not have been brought from\r\nafar, and the captain knew that it had not been there a year ago. We\r\nagreed that such a beast could never have been killed by any assault of\r\nman, and that the gate must have been a fallen tusk, and one fallen near\r\nand recently. Therefore he decided that it were better to flee at once; so\r\nhe commanded, and the sailors went to the sails, and others raised the\r\nanchor to the deck, and just as the highest pinnacle of marble lost the\r\nlast rays of the sun we left Perd\xf3ndaris, that famous city. And night came\r\ndown and cloaked Perd\xf3ndaris and hid it from our eyes, which as things\r\nhave happened will never see it again; for I have heard since that\r\nsomething swift and wonderful has suddenly wrecked Perd\xf3ndaris in a\r\nday--towers, walls and people.\r\n\r\nAnd the night deepened over the River Yann, a night all white with stars.\r\nAnd with the night there rose the helmsman\'s song. As soon as he had\r\nprayed he began to sing to cheer himself all through the lonely night. But\r\nfirst he prayed, praying the helmsman\'s prayer. And this is what I\r\nremember of it, rendered into English with a very feeble equivalent of the\r\nrhythm that seemed so resonant in those tropic nights.\r\n\r\nTo whatever god may hear.\r\n\r\nWherever there be sailors whether of river or sea: whether their way be\r\ndark or whether through storm: whether their peril be of beast or of rock:\r\nor from enemy lurking on land or pursuing on sea: wherever the tiller is\r\ncold or the helmsman stiff: wherever sailors sleep or helmsmen watch:\r\nguard, guide and return us to the old land, that has known us: to the far\r\nhomes that we know.\r\n\r\nTo all the gods that are.\r\n\r\nTo whatever god may hear.\r\n\r\nSo he prayed, and there was silence. And the sailors laid them down to\r\nrest for the night. The silence deepened, and was only broken by the\r\nripples of Yann that lightly touched our prow. Sometimes some monster of\r\nthe river coughed.\r\n\r\nSilence and ripples, ripples and silence again.\r\n\r\nAnd then his loneliness came upon the helmsman, and he began to sing. And\r\nhe sang the market songs of Durl and Duz, and the old dragon-legends of\r\nBelzoond.\r\n\r\nMany a song he sang, telling to spacious and exotic Yann the little tales\r\nand trifles of his city of Durl. And the songs welled up over the black\r\njungle and came into the clear cold air above, and the great bands of\r\nstars that look on Yann began to know the affairs of Durl and Duz, and of\r\nthe shepherds that dwelt in the fields between, and the flocks that they\r\nhad, and the loves that they had loved, and all the little things that\r\nthey had hoped to do. And as I lay wrapped up in skins and blankets,\r\nlistening to those songs, and watching the fantastic shapes of the great\r\ntrees like to black giants stalking through the night, I suddenly fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke great mists were trailing away from the Yann. And the flow of\r\nthe river was tumbling now tumultuously, and little waves appeared; for\r\nYann had scented from afar the ancient crags of Glorm, and knew that their\r\nravines lay cool before him wherein he should meet the merry wild Irillion\r\nrejoicing from fields of snow. So he shook off from him the torpid sleep\r\nthat had come upon him in the hot and scented jungle, and forgot its\r\norchids and its butterflies, and swept on turbulent, expectant, strong;\r\nand soon the snowy peaks of the Hills of Glorm came glittering into view.\r\nAnd now the sailors were waking up from sleep. Soon we all ate, and then\r\nthe helmsman laid him down to sleep while a comrade took his place, and\r\nthey all spread over him their choicest furs.\r\n\r\nAnd in a while we heard the sound that the Irillion made as she came down\r\ndancing from the fields of snow.\r\n\r\nAnd then we saw the ravine in the Hills of Glorm lying precipitous and\r\nsmooth before us, into which we were carried by the leaps of Yann. And now\r\nwe left the steamy jungle and breathed the mountain air; the sailors stood\r\nup and took deep breaths of it, and thought of their own far off Acroctian\r\nhills on which were Durl and Duz--below them in the plains stands fair\r\nBelzoond.\r\n\r\nA great shadow brooded between the cliffs of Glorm, but the crags were\r\nshining above us like gnarled moons, and almost lit the gloom. Louder and\r\nlouder came the Irillion\'s song, and the sound of her dancing down from\r\nthe fields of snow. And soon we saw her white and full of mists, and\r\nwreathed with rainbows delicate and small that she had plucked up near the\r\nmountain\'s summit from some celestial garden of the Sun. Then she went\r\naway seawards with the huge grey Yann and the ravine widened, and opened\r\nupon the world, and our rocking ship came through to the light of the day.\r\n\r\nAnd all that morning and all the afternoon we passed through the marshes\r\nof Pondoovery; and Yann widened there, and flowed solemnly and slowly, and\r\nthe captain bade the sailors beat on bells to overcome the dreariness of\r\nthe marshes.\r\n\r\nAt last the Irusian mountains came in sight, nursing the villages of\r\nPen-Kai and Blut, and the wandering streets of Mlo, where priests\r\npropitiate the avalanche with wine and maize. Then night came down over\r\nthe plains of Tlun, and we saw the lights of Cappadarnia. We heard the\r\nPathnites beating upon drums as we passed Imaut and Golzunda, then all but\r\nthe helmsman slept. And villages scattered along the banks of the Yann\r\nheard all that night in the helmsman\'s unknown tongue the little songs of\r\ncities that they knew not.\r\n\r\nI awoke before dawn with a feeling that I was unhappy before I remembered\r\nwhy. Then I recalled that by the evening of the approaching day, according\r\nto all foreseen probabilities, we should come to Bar-Wul-Yann, and I\r\nshould part from the captain and his sailors. And I had liked the man\r\nbecause he had given me of his yellow wine that was set apart among his\r\nsacred things, and many a story he had told me about his fair Belzoond\r\nbetween the Acroctian hills and the Hian Min. And I had liked the ways\r\nthat his sailors had, and the prayers that they prayed at evening side by\r\nside, grudging not one another their alien gods. And I had a liking too\r\nfor the tender way in which they often spoke of Durl and Duz, for it is\r\ngood that men should love their native cities and the little hills that\r\nhold those cities up.\r\n\r\nAnd I had come to know who would meet them when they returned to their\r\nhomes, and where they thought the meetings would take place, some in a\r\nvalley of the Acroctian hills where the road comes up from Yann, others in\r\nthe gateway of one or another of the three cities, and others by the\r\nfireside in the home. And I thought of the danger that had menaced us all\r\nalike outside Perd\xf3ndaris, a danger that, as things have happened, was\r\nvery real.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought too of the helmsman\'s cheery song in the cold and lonely\r\nnight, and how he had held our lives in his careful hands. And as I\r\nthought of this the helmsman ceased to sing, and I looked up and saw a\r\npale light had appeared in the sky, and the lonely night had passed; and\r\nthe dawn widened, and the sailors awoke.\r\n\r\nAnd soon we saw the tide of the Sea himself advancing resolute between\r\nYann\'s borders, and Yann sprang lithely at him and they struggled awhile;\r\nthen Yann and all that was his were pushed back northward, so that the\r\nsailors had to hoist the sails and, the wind being favorable, we still\r\nheld onwards.\r\n\r\nAnd we passed Gondara and Narl and Haz. And we saw memorable, holy Golnuz,\r\nand heard the pilgrims praying.\r\n\r\nWhen we awoke after the midday rest we were coming near to Nen, the last\r\nof the cities on the River Yann. And the jungle was all about us once\r\nagain, and about Nen; but the great Mloon ranges stood up over all things,\r\nand watched the city from beyond the jungle.\r\n\r\nHere we anchored, and the captain and I went up into the city and found\r\nthat the Wanderers had come into Nen.\r\n\r\nAnd the Wanderers were a weird, dark, tribe, that once in every seven\r\nyears came down from the peaks of Mloon, having crossed by a pass that is\r\nknown to them from some fantastic land that lies beyond. And the people of\r\nNen were all outside their houses, and all stood wondering at their own\r\nstreets. For the men and women of the Wanderers had crowded all the ways,\r\nand every one was doing some strange thing. Some danced astounding dances\r\nthat they had learned from the desert wind, rapidly curving and swirling\r\ntill the eye could follow no longer. Others played upon instruments\r\nbeautiful wailing tunes that were full of horror, which souls had taught\r\nthem lost by night in the desert, that strange far desert from which the\r\nWanderers came.\r\n\r\nNone of their instruments were such as were known in Nen nor in any part\r\nof the region of the Yann; even the horns out of which some were made were\r\nof beasts that none had seen along the river, for they were barbed at the\r\ntips. And they sang, in the language of none, songs that seemed to be akin\r\nto the mysteries of night and to the unreasoned fear that haunts dark\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nBitterly all the dogs of Nen distrusted them. And the Wanderers told one\r\nanother fearful tales, for though no one in Nen knew ought of their\r\nlanguage yet they could see the fear on the listeners\' faces, and as the\r\ntale wound on the whites of their eyes showed vividly in terror as the\r\neyes of some little beast whom the hawk has seized. Then the teller of the\r\ntale would smile and stop, and another would tell his story, and the\r\nteller of the first tale\'s lips would chatter with fear. And if some\r\ndeadly snake chanced to appear the Wanderers would greet him as a brother,\r\nand the snake would seem to give his greetings to them before he passed on\r\nagain. Once that most fierce and lethal of tropic snakes, the giant\r\nlythra, came out of the jungle and all down the street, the central street\r\nof Nen, and none of the Wanderers moved away from him, but they all played\r\nsonorously on drums, as though he had been a person of much honour; and\r\nthe snake moved through the midst of them and smote none.\r\n\r\nEven the Wanderers\' children could do strange things, for if any one of\r\nthem met with a child of Nen the two would stare at each other in silence\r\nwith large grave eyes; then the Wanderers\' child would slowly draw from\r\nhis turban a live fish or snake. And the children of Nen could do nothing\r\nof that kind at all.\r\n\r\nMuch I should have wished to stay and hear the hymn with which they greet\r\nthe night, that is answered by the wolves on the heights of Mloon, but it\r\nwas now time to raise the anchor again that the captain might return from\r\nBar-Wul-Yann upon the landward tide. So we went on board and continued\r\ndown the Yann. And the captain and I spoke little, for we were thinking of\r\nour parting, which should be for long, and we watched instead the\r\nsplendour of the westerning sun. For the sun was a ruddy gold, but a faint\r\nmist cloaked the jungle, lying low, and into it poured the smoke of the\r\nlittle jungle cities, and the smoke of them met together in the mist and\r\njoined into one haze, which became purple, and was lit by the sun, as the\r\nthoughts of men become hallowed by some great and sacred thing. Some times\r\none column from a lonely house would rise up higher than the cities\'\r\nsmoke, and gleam by itself in the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd now as the sun\'s last rays were nearly level, we saw the sight that I\r\nhad come to see, for from two mountains that stood on either shore two\r\ncliffs of pink marble came out into the river, all glowing in the light of\r\nthe low sun, and they were quite smooth and of mountainous altitude, and\r\nthey nearly met, and Yann went tumbling between them and found the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd this was Bar-Wul-Yann, the Gate of Yann, and in the distance through\r\nthat barrier\'s gap I saw the azure indescribable sea, where little\r\nfishing-boats went gleaming by.\r\n\r\nAnd the sun set, and the brief twilight came, and the exultation of the\r\nglory of Bar-Wul-Yann was gone, yet still the pink cliffs glowed, the\r\nfairest marvel that the eye beheld--and this in a land of wonders. And\r\nsoon the twilight gave place to the coming out of stars, and the colours\r\nof Bar-Wul-Yann went dwindling away. And the sight of those cliffs was to\r\nme as some chord of music that a master\'s hand had launched from the\r\nviolin, and which carries to Heaven or Fa\xebry the tremulous spirits of men.\r\n\r\nAnd now by the shore they anchored and went no further, for they were\r\nsailors of the river and not of the sea, and knew the Yann but not the\r\ntides beyond.\r\n\r\nAnd the time was come when the captain and I must part, he to go back to\r\nhis fair Belzoond in sight of the distant peaks of the Hian Min, and I to\r\nfind my way by strange means back to those hazy fields that all poets\r\nknow, wherein stand small mysterious cottages through whose windows,\r\nlooking westwards, you may see the fields of men, and looking eastwards\r\nsee glittering elfin mountains, tipped with snow, going range on range\r\ninto the region of Myth, and beyond it into the kingdom of Fantasy, which\r\npertain to the Lands of Dream. Long we regarded one another, knowing that\r\nwe should meet no more, for my fancy is weakening as the years slip by,\r\nand I go ever more seldom into the Lands of Dream. Then we clasped hands,\r\nuncouthly on his part, for it is not the method of greeting in his\r\ncountry, and he commended my soul to the care of his own gods, to his\r\nlittle lesser gods, the humble ones, to the gods that bless Belzoond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWORD AND THE IDOL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a cold winter\'s evening late in the Stone Age; the sun had gone\r\ndown blazing over the plains of Thold; there were no clouds, only the\r\nchill blue sky and the imminence of stars; and the surface of the sleeping\r\nEarth began to harden against the cold of the night. Presently from their\r\nlairs arose, and shook themselves and went stealthily forth, those of\r\nEarth\'s children to whom it is the law to prowl abroad as soon as the dusk\r\nhas fallen. And they went pattering softly over the plain, and their eyes\r\nshone in the dark, and crossed and recrossed one another in their courses.\r\nSuddenly there became manifest in the midst of the plain that fearful\r\nportent of the presence of Man--a little flickering fire. And the children\r\nof Earth who prowl abroad by night looked sideways at it and snarled and\r\nedged away; all but the wolves, who came a little nearer, for it was\r\nwinter and the wolves were hungry, and they had come in thousands from the\r\nmountains, and they said in their hearts, "We are strong." Around the fire\r\na little tribe was encamped. They, too, had come from the mountains, and\r\nfrom lands beyond them, but it was in the mountains that the wolves first\r\nwinded them; they picked up bones at first that the tribe had dropped, but\r\nthey were closer now and on all sides. It was Loz who had lit the fire. He\r\nhad killed a small furry beast, hurling his stone axe at it, and had\r\ngathered a quantity of reddish-brown stones, and had laid them in a long\r\nrow, and placed bits of the small beast all along it; then he lit a fire\r\non each side, and the stones heated, and the bits began to cook. It was at\r\nthis time that the tribe noticed that the wolves who had followed them so\r\nfar were no longer content with the scraps of deserted encampments. A line\r\nof yellow eyes surrounded them, and when it moved it was to come nearer.\r\nSo the men of the tribe hastily tore up brushwood, and felled a small tree\r\nwith their flint axes, and heaped it all over the fire that Loz had made,\r\nand for a while the great heap hid the flame, and the wolves came trotting\r\nin and sat down again on their haunches much closer than before; and the\r\nfierce and valiant dogs that belonged to the tribe believed that their end\r\nwas about to come while fighting, as they had long since prophesied it\r\nwould. Then the flame caught the lofty stack of brushwood, and rushed out\r\nof it, and ran up the side of it, and stood up haughtily far over the top,\r\nand the wolves seeing this terrible ally of Man reveling there in his\r\nstrength, and knowing nothing of this frequent treachery to his masters,\r\nwent slowly away as though they had other purposes. And for the rest of\r\nthat night the dogs of the encampment cried out to them and besought them\r\nto come back. But the tribe lay down all round the fire under thick furs\r\nand slept. And a great wind arose and blew into the roaring heart of the\r\nfire till it was red no longer, but all pallid with heat. With the dawn\r\nthe tribe awoke.\r\n\r\nLoz might have known that after such a mighty conflagration nothing could\r\nremain of his small furry beast, but there was hunger in him and little\r\nreason as he searched among the ashes. What he found there amazed him\r\nbeyond measure; there was no meat, there was not even his row of\r\nreddish-brown stones, but something longer than a man\'s leg and narrower\r\nthan his hand, was lying there like a great flattened snake. When Loz\r\nlooked at its thin edges and saw that it ran to a point, he picked up\r\nstones to chip it and make it sharp. It was the instinct of Loz to sharpen\r\nthings. When he found that it could not be chipped his wonderment\r\nincreased. It was many hours before he discovered that he could sharpen\r\nthe edges by rubbing them with a stone; but at last the point was sharp,\r\nand all one side of it except near the end, where Loz held it in his hand.\r\nAnd Loz lifted it and brandished it, and the Stone Age was over. That\r\nafternoon in the little encampment, just as the tribe moved on, the Stone\r\nAge passed away, which, for perhaps thirty or forty thousand years, had\r\nslowly lifted Man from among the beasts and left him with his supremacy\r\nbeyond all hope of reconquest.\r\n\r\nIt was not for many days that any other man tried to make for himself an\r\niron sword by cooking the same kind of small furry beast that Loz had\r\ntried to cook. It was not for many years that any thought to lay the meat\r\nalong stones as Loz had done; and when they did, being no longer on the\r\nplains of Thold, they used flints or chalk. It was not for many\r\ngenerations that another piece of iron ore was melted and the secret\r\nslowly guessed. Nevertheless one of Earth\'s many veils was torn aside by\r\nLoz to give us ultimately the steel sword and the plough, machinery and\r\nfactories; let us not blame Loz if we think that he did wrong, for he did\r\nall in ignorance. The tribe moved on until it came to water, and there it\r\nsettled down under a hill, and they built their huts there. Very soon they\r\nhad to fight with another tribe, a tribe that was stronger than they; but\r\nthe sword of Loz was terrible and his tribe slew their foes. You might\r\nmake one blow at Loz, but then would come one thrust from that iron sword,\r\nand there was no way of surviving it. No one could fight with Loz. And he\r\nbecame ruler of the tribe in the place of Iz, who hitherto had ruled it\r\nwith his sharp axe, as his father had before him.\r\n\r\nNow Loz begat Lo, and in his old age gave his sword to him, and Lo ruled\r\nthe tribe with it. And Lo called the name of the sword Death, because it\r\nwas so swift and terrible.\r\n\r\nAnd Iz begat Ird, who was of no account. And Ird hated Lo because he was\r\nof no account by reason of the iron sword of Lo.\r\n\r\nOne night Ird stole down to the hut of Lo, carrying his sharp axe, and he\r\nwent very softly, but Lo\'s dog, Warner, heard him coming, and he growled\r\nsoftly by his master\'s door. When Ird came to the hut he heard Lo talking\r\ngently to his sword. And Lo was saying, "Lie still, Death. Rest, rest, old\r\nsword," and then, "What, again, Death? Be still. Be still."\r\n\r\nAnd then again: "What, art thou hungry, Death? Or thirsty, poor old sword?\r\nSoon, Death, soon. Be still only a little."\r\n\r\nBut Ird fled, for he did not like the gentle tone of Lo as he spoke to his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nAnd Lo begat Lod. And when Lo died Lod took the iron sword and ruled the\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nAnd Ird begat Ith, who was of no account, like his father.\r\n\r\nNow when Lod had smitten a man or killed a terrible beast, Ith would go\r\naway for a while into the forest rather than hear the praises that would\r\nbe given to Lod.\r\n\r\nAnd once, as Ith sat in the forest waiting for the day to pass, he\r\nsuddenly thought he saw a tree trunk looking at him as with a face. And\r\nIth was afraid, for trees should not look at men. But soon Ith saw that it\r\nwas only a tree and not a man, though it was like a man. Ith used to speak\r\nto this tree, and tell it about Lod, for he dared not speak to any one\r\nelse about him. And Ith found comfort in speaking about Lod.\r\n\r\nOne day Ith went with his stone axe into the forest, and stayed there many\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHe came back by night, and the next morning when the tribe awoke they saw\r\nsomething that was like a man and yet was not a man. And it sat on the\r\nhill with its elbows pointing outwards and was quite still. And Ith was\r\ncrouching before it, and hurriedly placing before it fruits and flesh, and\r\nthen leaping away from it and looking frightened. Presently all the tribe\r\ncame out to see, but dared not come quite close because of the fear that\r\nthey saw on the face of Ith. And Ith went to his hut, and came back again\r\nwith a hunting spear-head and valuable small stone knives, and reached out\r\nand laid them before the thing that was like a man, and then sprang away\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nAnd some of the tribe questioned Ith about the still thing that was like a\r\nman, and Ith said, "This is Ged." Then they asked, "Who is Ged?" and Ith\r\nsaid, "Ged sends the crops and the rain; and the sun and the moon are\r\nGed\'s."\r\n\r\nThen the tribe went back to their huts, but later in the day some came\r\nagain, and they said to Ith, "Ged is only as we are, having hands and\r\nfeet." And Ith pointed to the right hand of Ged, which was not as his\r\nleft, but was shaped like the paw of a beast, and Ith said, "By this ye\r\nmay know that he is not as any man."\r\n\r\nThen they said, "He is indeed Ged." But Lod said, "He speaketh not, nor\r\ndoth he eat," and Ith answered, "The thunder is his voice and the famine\r\nis his eating."\r\n\r\nAfter this the tribe copied Ith, and brought little gifts of meat to Ged;\r\nand Ith cooked them before him that Ged might smell the cooking.\r\n\r\nOne day a great thunderstorm came trampling up from the distance and raged\r\namong the hills, and the tribe all hid away from it in their huts. And Ith\r\nappeared among the huts looking unafraid. And Ith said little, but the\r\ntribe thought that he had expected the terrible storm because the meat\r\nthat they had laid before Ged had been tough meat, and not the best parts\r\nof the beasts they slew.\r\n\r\nAnd Ged grew to have more honour among the tribe than Lod. And Lod was\r\nvexed.\r\n\r\nOne night Lod arose when all were asleep, and quieted his dog, and took\r\nhis iron sword and went away to the hill. And he came on Ged in the\r\nstarlight, sitting still, with his elbows pointing outwards, and his\r\nbeast\'s paw, and the mark of the fire on the ground where his food had\r\nbeen cooked.\r\n\r\nAnd Lod stood there for a while in great fear, trying to keep to his\r\npurpose. Suddenly he stepped up close to Ged and lifted his iron sword,\r\nand Ged neither hit nor shrank. Then the thought came into Lod\'s mind,\r\n"Ged does not hit. What will Ged do instead?"\r\n\r\nAnd Lod lowered his sword and struck not, and his imagination began to\r\nwork on that "What will Ged do instead?"\r\n\r\nAnd the more Lod thought, the worse was his fear of Ged.\r\n\r\nAnd Lod ran away and left him.\r\n\r\nLod still ruled the tribe in battle or in the hunt, but the chiefest\r\nspoils of battle were given to Ged, and the beasts that they slew were\r\nGed\'s; and all questions that concerned war or peace, and questions of law\r\nand disputes, were always brought to him, and Ith gave the answers after\r\nspeaking to Ged by night.\r\n\r\nAt last Ith said, the day after an eclipse, that the gifts which they\r\nbrought to Ged were not enough, that some far greater sacrifice was\r\nneeded, that Ged was very angry even now, and not to be appeased by any\r\nordinary sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd Ith said that to save the tribe from the anger of Ged he would speak\r\nto Ged that night, and ask him what new sacrifice he needed.\r\n\r\nDeep in his heart Lod shuddered, for his instinct told him that Ged wanted\r\nLod\'s only son, who should hold the iron sword when Lod was gone.\r\n\r\nNo one would dare touch Lod because of the iron sword, but his instinct\r\nsaid in his slow mind again and again, "Ged loves Ith. Ith has said so.\r\nIth hates the sword-holders."\r\n\r\n"Ith hates the sword-holders. Ged loves Ith."\r\n\r\nEvening fell and the night came when Ith should speak with Ged, and Lod\r\nbecame ever surer of the doom of his race.\r\n\r\nHe lay down but could not sleep.\r\n\r\nMidnight had barely come when Lod arose and went with his iron sword again\r\nto the hill.\r\n\r\nAnd there sat Ged. Had Ith been to him yet? Ith whom Ged loved, who hated\r\nthe sword-holders.\r\n\r\nAnd Lod looked long at the old sword of iron that had come to his\r\ngrandfather on the plains of Thold.\r\n\r\nGood-bye, old sword! And Lod laid it on the knees of Ged, then went away.\r\n\r\nAnd when Ith came, a little before dawn, the sacrifice was found\r\nacceptable unto Ged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDLE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a city which was an idle city, wherein men told vain tales.\r\n\r\nAnd it was that city\'s custom to tax all men that would enter in, with the\r\ntoll of some idle story in the gate.\r\n\r\nSo all men paid to the watchers in the gate the toll of an idle story, and\r\npassed into the city unhindered and unhurt. And in a certain hour of the\r\nnight when the king of that city arose and went pacing swiftly up and down\r\nthe chamber of his sleeping, and called upon the name of the dead queen,\r\nthen would the watchers fasten up the gate and go into that chamber to the\r\nking, and, sitting on the floor, would tell him all the tales that they\r\nhad gathered. And listening to them some calmer mood would come upon the\r\nking, and listening still he would lie down again and at last fall asleep,\r\nand all the watchers silently would arise and steal away from the chamber.\r\n\r\nA while ago wandering, I came to the gate of that city. And even as I came\r\na man stood up to pay his toll to the watchers. They were seated\r\ncross-legged on the ground between him and the gate, and each one held a\r\nspear. Near him two other travellers sat on the warm sand waiting. And the\r\nman said:\r\n\r\n"Now the city of Nombros forsook the worship of the gods and turned\r\ntowards God. So the gods threw their cloaks over their faces and strode\r\naway from the city, and going into the haze among the hills passed through\r\nthe trunks of the olive groves into the sunset. But when they had already\r\nleft the Earth, they turned and looked through the gleaming folds of the\r\ntwilight for the last time at their city; and they looked half in anger\r\nand half in regret, then turned and went away for ever. But they sent back\r\na Death, who bore a scythe, saying to it: \'Slay half in the city that\r\nforsook us, but half of them spare alive that they may yet remember their\r\nold forsaken gods.\'\r\n\r\n"But God sent a destroying angel to show that He was God, saying unto him:\r\n\'Go into that city and slay half of the dwellers therein, yet spare a half\r\nof them that they may know that I am God.\'\r\n\r\n"And at once the destroying angel put his hand to his sword, and the sword\r\ncame out of the scabbard with a deep breath, like to the breath that a\r\nbroad woodman takes before his first blow at some giant oak. Thereat the\r\nangel pointed his arms downwards, and bending his head between them, fell\r\nforward from Heaven\'s edge, and the spring of his ankles shot him\r\ndownwards with his wings furled behind him. So he went slanting earthward\r\nthrough the evening with his sword stretched out before him, and he was\r\nlike a javelin that some hunter hath hurled that returneth again to the\r\nearth: but just before he touched it he lifted his head and spread his\r\nwings with the under feathers forward, and alighted by the bank of the\r\nbroad Flavro that divides the city of Nombros. And down the bank of the\r\nFlavro he fluttered low, like to a hawk over a new-cut cornfield when the\r\nlittle creatures of the corn are shelterless, and at the same time down\r\nthe other bank the Death from the gods went mowing.\r\n\r\n"At once they saw each other, and the angel glared at the Death, and the\r\nDeath leered back at him, and the flames in the eyes of the angel\r\nillumined with a red glare the mist that lay in the hollows of the sockets\r\nof the Death. Suddenly they fell on one another, sword to scythe. And the\r\nangel captured the temples of the gods, and set up over them the sign of\r\nGod, and the Death captured the temples of God, and led into them the\r\nceremonies and sacrifices of the gods; and all the while the centuries\r\nslipped quietly by, going down the Flavro seawards.\r\n\r\n"And now some worship God in the temple of the gods, and others worship the\r\ngods in the temple of God, and still the angel hath not returned again to\r\nthe rejoicing choirs, and still the Death hath not gone back to die with\r\nthe dead gods; but all through Nombros they fight up and down, and still\r\non each side of the Flavro the city lives."\r\n\r\nAnd the watchers in the gate said, "Enter in."\r\n\r\nThen another traveler rose up, and said:\r\n\r\n"Solemnly between Huhenwazy and Nitcrana the huge grey clouds came\r\nfloating. And those great mountains, heavenly Huhenwazi and Nitcrana, the\r\nking of peaks, greeted them, calling them brothers. And the clouds were\r\nglad of their greeting, for they meet with companions seldom in the lonely\r\nheights of the sky.\r\n\r\n"But the vapours of evening said unto the earth-mist, \'What are those\r\nshapes that dare to move above us and to go where Nitcrana is and\r\nHuhenwazi?\'\r\n\r\n"And the earth-mist said in answer unto the vapours of evening, \'It is\r\nonly an earth-mist that has become mad and has left the warm and\r\ncomfortable earth, and has in his madness thought that his place is with\r\nHuhenwazi and Nitcrana.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Once,\' said the vapours of evening, \'there were clouds, but this was\r\nmany and many a day ago, as our forefathers have said. Perhaps the mad one\r\nthinks he is the clouds.\'\r\n\r\n"Then spake the earth-worms from the warm deeps of the mud, saying \'O\r\nearth-mist, thou art indeed the clouds, and there are no clouds but thou.\r\nAnd as for Huhenwazi and Nitcrana, I cannot see them, and therefore they\r\nare not high, and there are no mountains in the world but those that I\r\ncast up every morning out of the deeps of the mud.\'\r\n\r\n"And the earth-mist and the vapours of evening were glad at the voice of\r\nthe earth-worms, and looking earthward believed what they had said.\r\n\r\n"And indeed it is better to be as the earth-mist, and to keep close to the\r\nwarm mud at night, and to hear the earth-worm\'s comfortable speech, and\r\nnot to be a wanderer in the cheerless heights, but to leave the mountains\r\nalone with their desolate snow, to draw what comfort they can from their\r\nvast aspect over all the cities of men, and from the whispers that they\r\nhear at evening of unknown distant gods."\r\n\r\nAnd the watchers in the gate said, "Enter in."\r\n\r\nThen a man stood up who came out of the west, and told a western tale. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"There is a road in Rome that runs through an ancient temple that once the\r\ngods had loved; it runs along the top of a great wall, and the floor of\r\nthe temple lies far down beneath it, of marble, pink and white.\r\n\r\n"Upon the temple floor I counted to the number of thirteen hungry cats.\r\n\r\n"\'Sometimes,\' they said among themselves, \'it was the gods that lived\r\nhere, sometimes it was men, and now it\'s cats. So let us enjoy the sun on\r\nthe hot marble before another people comes.\'\r\n\r\n"For it was at that hour of a warm afternoon when my fancy is able to hear\r\nsilent voices.\r\n\r\n"And the awful leanness of all those thirteen cats moved me to go into a\r\nneighbouring fish shop, and there to buy a quantity of fishes. Then I\r\nreturned and threw them all over the railing at the top of the great wall,\r\nand they fell for thirty feet, and hit the sacred marble with a smack.\r\n\r\n"Now, in any other town but Rome, or in the minds of any other cats, the\r\nsight of fishes falling out of heaven had surely excited wonder. They rose\r\nslowly, and all stretched themselves, then they came leisurely towards the\r\nfishes. \'It is only a miracle,\' they said in their hearts."\r\n\r\nAnd the watchers in the gate said, "Enter in."\r\n\r\nProudly and slowly, as they spoke, drew up to them a camel, whose rider\r\nsought entrance to the city. His face shone with the sunset by which for\r\nlong he had steered for the city\'s gate. Of him they demanded toll.\r\nWhereat he spoke to his camel, and the camel roared and kneeled, and the\r\nman descended from him. And the man unwrapped from many silks a box of\r\ndivers metals wrought by the Japanese, and on the lid of it were figures\r\nof men who gazed from some shore at an isle of the Inland Sea. This he\r\nshowed to the watchers, and when they had seen it, said, "It has seemed to\r\nme that these speak to each other thus:\r\n\r\n"\'Behold now Oojni, the dear one of the sea, the little mother sea that\r\nhath no storms. She goeth out from Oojni singing a song, and she returneth\r\nsinging over her sands. Little is Oojni in the lap of the sea, and scarce\r\nto be perceived by wondering ships. White sails have never wafted her\r\nlegends afar, they are told not by bearded wanderers of the sea. Her\r\nfireside tales are known not to the North, the dragons of China have not\r\nheard of them, nor those that ride on elephants through Ind.\r\n\r\n"\'Men tell the tales and the smoke ariseth upwards; the smoke departeth\r\nand the tales are told.\r\n\r\n"\'Oojni is not a name among the nations, she is not know of where the\r\nmerchants meet, she is not spoken of by alien lips.\r\n\r\n"\'Indeed, but Oojni is a little among the isles, yet is she loved by those\r\nthat know her coasts and her inland places hidden from the sea.\r\n\r\n"Without glory, without fame, and without wealth, Oojni is greatly loved\r\nby a little people, and by a few; yet not by few, for all her dead still\r\nlove her, and oft by night come whispering through her woods. Who could\r\nforget Oojni even among the dead?\r\n\r\n"For here in Oojni, wot you, are homes of men, and gardens, and golden\r\ntemples of the gods, and sacred places inshore from the sea, and many\r\nmurmurous woods. And there is a path that winds over the hills to go into\r\nmysterious holy lands where dance by night the spirits of the woods, or\r\nsing unseen in the sunlight; and no one goes into these holy lands, for\r\nwho that love Oojni could rob her of her mysteries, and the curious aliens\r\ncome not. Indeed, but we love Oojni though she is so little; she is the\r\nlittle mother of our race, and the kindly nurse of all seafaring birds.\r\n\r\n"And behold, even now caressing her, the gentle fingers of the mother sea,\r\nwhose dreams are far with that old wanderer Ocean.\r\n\r\n"And yet let us forget not Fuzi-Yama, for he stands manifest over clouds\r\nand sea, misty below, and vague and indistinct, but clear above for all\r\nthe isles to watch. The ships make all their journeys in his sight, the\r\nnights and the days go by him like a wind, the summers and winters under\r\nhim flicker and fade, the lives of men pass quietly here and hence, and\r\nFuzi-Yama watches there--and knows."\r\n\r\nAnd the watchers in the gate said, "Enter in."\r\n\r\nAnd I, too, would have told them a tale, very wonderful and very true; one\r\nthat I had told in many cities, which as yet had no believers. But now the\r\nsun had set, and the brief twilight gone, and ghostly silences were rising\r\nfrom far and darkening hills. A stillness hung over that city\'s gate. And\r\nthe great silence of the solemn night was more acceptable to the watchers\r\nin the gate than any sound of man. Therefore they beckoned to us, and\r\nmotioned with their hands that we should pass untaxed into the city. And\r\nsoftly we went up over the sand, and between the high rock pillars of the\r\ngate, and a deep stillness settled among the watchers, and the stars over\r\nthem twinkled undisturbed.\r\n\r\nFor how short a while man speaks, and withal how vainly. And for how long\r\nhe is silent. Only the other day I met a king in Thebes, who had been\r\nsilent already for four thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HASHISH MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI was at a dinner in London the other day. The ladies had gone upstairs,\r\nand no one sat on my right; on my left there was a man I did not know, but\r\nhe knew my name somehow apparently, for he turned to me after a while, and\r\nsaid, "I read a story of yours about Bethmoora in a review."\r\n\r\nOf course I remembered the tale. It was about a beautiful Oriental city\r\nthat was suddenly deserted in a day--nobody quite knew why. I said, "Oh,\r\nyes," and slowly searched in my mind for some more fitting acknowledgment\r\nof the compliment that his memory had paid me.\r\n\r\nI was greatly astonished when he said, "You were wrong about the gnousar\r\nsickness; it was not that at all."\r\n\r\nI said, "Why! Have you been there?"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, "Yes; I do it with hashish. I know Bethmoora well." And he\r\ntook out of his pocket a small box full of some black stuff that looked\r\nlike tar, but had a stranger smell. He warned me not to touch it with my\r\nfinger, as the stain remained for days. "I got it from a gipsy," he said.\r\n"He had a lot of it, as it had killed his father." But I interrupted him,\r\nfor I wanted to know for certain what it was that had made desolate that\r\nbeautiful city, Bethmoora, and why they fled from it swiftly in a day.\r\n"Was it because of the Desert\'s curse?" I asked. And he said, "Partly it\r\nwas the fury of the Desert and partly the advice of the Emperor Thuba\r\nMleen, for that fearful beast is in some way connected with the Desert on\r\nhis mother\'s side." And he told me this strange story: "You remember the\r\nsailor with the black scar, who was there on the day that you described\r\nwhen the messengers came on mules to the gate of Bethmoora, and all the\r\npeople fled. I met this man in a tavern, drinking rum, and he told me all\r\nabout the flight from Bethmoora, but knew no more than you did what the\r\nmessage was, or who had sent it. However, he said he would see Bethmoora\r\nonce more whenever he touched again at an eastern port, even if he had to\r\nface the Devil. He often said that he would face the Devil to find out the\r\nmystery of that message that emptied Bethmoora in a day. And in the end he\r\nhad to face Thuba Mleen, whose weak ferocity he had not imagined. For one\r\nday the sailor told me he had found a ship, and I met him no more after\r\nthat in the tavern drinking rum. It was about that time that I got the\r\nhashish from the gipsy, who had a quantity that he did not want. It takes\r\none literally out of oneself. It is like wings. You swoop over distant\r\ncountries and into other worlds. Once I found out the secret of the\r\nuniverse. I have forgotten what it was, but I know that the Creator does\r\nnot take Creation seriously, for I remember that He sat in Space with all\r\nHis work in front of Him and laughed. I have seen incredible things in\r\nfearful worlds. As it is your imagination that takes you there, so it is\r\nonly by your imagination that you can get back. Once out in aether I met a\r\nbattered, prowling spirit, that had belonged to a man whom drugs had\r\nkilled a hundred years ago; and he led me to regions that I had never\r\nimagined; and we parted in anger beyond the Pleiades, and I could not\r\nimagine my way back. And I met a huge grey shape that was the Spirit of\r\nsome great people, perhaps of a whole star, and I besought It to show me\r\nmy way home, and It halted beside me like a sudden wind and pointed, and,\r\nspeaking quite softly, asked me if I discerned a certain tiny light, and I\r\nsaw a far star faintly, and then It said to me, \'That is the Solar\r\nSystem,\' and strode tremendously on. And somehow I imagined my way back,\r\nand only just in time, for my body was already stiffening in a chair in my\r\nroom; and the fire had gone out and everything was cold, and I had to move\r\neach finger one by one, and there were pins and needles in them, and\r\ndreadful pains in the nails, which began to thaw; and at last I could move\r\none arm, and reached a bell, and for a long time no one came, because\r\nevery one was in bed. But at last a man appeared, and they got a doctor;\r\nand HE said that it was hashish poisoning, but it would have been all\r\nright if I hadn\'t met that battered, prowling spirit.\r\n\r\n"I could tell you astounding things that I have seen, but you want to know\r\nwho sent that message to Bethmoora. Well, it was Thuba Mleen. And this is\r\nhow I know. I often went to the city after that day you wrote of (I used\r\nto take hashish of an evening in my flat), and I always found it\r\nuninhabited. Sand had poured into it from the desert, and the streets were\r\nyellow and smooth, and through open, swinging doors the sand had drifted.\r\n\r\n"One evening I had put the guard in front of the fire, and settled into a\r\nchair and eaten my hashish, and the first thing that I saw when I came to\r\nBethmoora was the sailor with the black scar, strolling down the street,\r\nand making footprints in the yellow sand. And now I knew that I should see\r\nwhat secret power it was that kept Bethmoora uninhabited.\r\n\r\n"I saw that there was anger in the Desert, for there were storm clouds\r\nheaving along the skyline, and I heard a muttering amongst the sand.\r\n\r\n"The sailor strolled on down the street, looking into the empty houses as\r\nhe went; sometimes he shouted and sometimes he sang, and sometimes he\r\nwrote his name on a marble wall. Then he sat down on a step and ate his\r\ndinner. After a while he grew tired of the city, and came back up the\r\nstreet. As he reached the gate of green copper three men on camels\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n"I could do nothing. I was only a consciousness, invisible, wandering: my\r\nbody was in Europe. The sailor fought well with his fists, but he was\r\nover-powered and bound with ropes, and led away through the Desert.\r\n\r\n"I followed for as long as I could stay, and found that they were going by\r\nthe way of the Desert round the Hills of Hap towards Utnar V\xe9hi, and then\r\nI knew that the camel men belonged to Thuba Mleen.\r\n\r\n"I work in an insurance office all day, and I hope you won\'t forget me if\r\never you want to insure--life, fire, or motor--but that\'s no part of my\r\nstory. I was desperately anxious to get back to my flat, though it is not\r\ngood to take hashish two days running; but I wanted to see what they would\r\ndo to the poor fellow, for I had heard bad rumours about Thuba Mleen. When\r\nat last I got away I had a letter to write; then I rang for my servant,\r\nand told him that I must not be disturbed, though I left my door unlocked\r\nin case of accidents. After that I made up a good fire, and sat down and\r\npartook of the pot of dreams. I was going to the palace of Thuba Mleen.\r\n\r\n"I was kept back longer than usual by noises in the street, but suddenly I\r\nwas up above the town; the European countries rushed by beneath me, and\r\nthere appeared the thin white palace spires of horrible Thuba Mleen. I\r\nfound him presently at the end of a little narrow room. A curtain of red\r\nleather hung behind him, on which all the names of God, written in\r\nYannish, were worked with a golden thread. Three windows were small and\r\nhigh. The Emperor seemed no more than about twenty, and looked small and\r\nweak. No smiles came on his nasty yellow face, though he tittered\r\ncontinually. As I looked from his low forehead to his quivering under lip,\r\nI became aware that there was some horror about him, though I was not able\r\nto perceive what it was. And then I saw it--the man never blinked; and\r\nthough later on I watched those eyes for a blink, it never happened once.\r\n\r\n"And then I followed the Emperor\'s rapt glance, and I saw the sailor lying\r\non the floor, alive but hideously rent, and the royal torturers were at\r\nwork all round him. They had torn long strips from him, but had not\r\ndetached them, and they were torturing the ends of them far away from the\r\nsailor." The man that I met at dinner told me many things which I must\r\nomit. "The sailor was groaning softly, and every time he groaned Thuba\r\nMleen tittered. I had no sense of smell, but I could hear and see, and I\r\ndo not know which was the most revolting--the terrible condition of the\r\nsailor or the happy unblinking face of horrible Thuba Mleen.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to go away, but the time was not yet come, and I had to stay\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\n"Suddenly the Emperor\'s face began to twitch violently and his under lip\r\nquivered faster, and he whimpered with anger, and cried with a shrill\r\nvoice, in Yannish, to the captain of his torturers that there was a spirit\r\nin the room. I feared not, for living men cannot lay hands on a spirit,\r\nbut all the torturers were appalled at his anger, and stopped their work,\r\nfor their hands trembled in fear. Then two men of the spear-guard slipped\r\nfrom the room, and each of them brought back presently a golden bowl, with\r\nknobs on it, full of hashish; and the bowls were large enough for heads to\r\nhave floated in had they been filled with blood. And the two men fell to\r\nrapidly, each eating with two great spoons--there was enough in each\r\nspoonful to have given dreams to a hundred men. And there came upon them\r\nsoon the hashish state, and their spirits hovered, preparing to go free,\r\nwhile I feared horribly, but ever and anon they fell back again to their\r\nbodies, recalled by some noise in the room. Still the men ate, but lazily\r\nnow, and without ferocity. At last the great spoons dropped out of their\r\nhands, and their spirits rose and left them. I could not flee. And the\r\nspirits were more horrible than the men, because they were young men, and\r\nnot yet wholly moulded to fit their fearful souls. Still the sailor\r\ngroaned softly, evoking little titters from the Emperor Thuba Mleen. Then\r\nthe two spirits rushed at me, and swept me thence as gusts of wind sweep\r\nbutterflies, and away we went from that small, pale, heinous man. There\r\nwas no escaping from these spirits\' fierce insistence. The energy in my\r\nminute lump of the drug was overwhelmed by the huge spoonsful that these\r\nmen had eaten with both hands. I was whirled over Arvle Woondery, and\r\nbrought to the lands of Snith, and swept on still until I came to Kragua,\r\nand beyond this to those bleak lands that are nearly unknown to fancy. And\r\nwe came at last to those ivory hills that are named the Mountains of\r\nMadness, and I tried to struggle against the spirits of that frightful\r\nEmperor\'s men, for I heard on the other side of the ivory hills the\r\npittering of those beasts that prey on the mad, as they prowled up and\r\ndown. It was no fault of mine that my little lump of hashish could not\r\nfight with their horrible spoonsful...."\r\n\r\nSome one was tugging at the hall-door bell. Presently a servant came and\r\ntold our host that a policeman in the hall wished to speak to him at once.\r\nHe apologised to us, and went outside, and we heard a man in heavy boots,\r\nwho spoke in a low voice to him. My friend got up and walked over to the\r\nwindow, and opened it, and looked outside. "I should think it will be a\r\nfine night," he said. Then he jumped out. When we put our astonished heads\r\nout of the window to look for him, he was already out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR OLD BILL\r\n\r\n\r\nOn an antique haunt of sailors, a tavern of the sea, the light of day was\r\nfading. For several evenings I had frequented this place, in the hope of\r\nhearing something from the sailors, as they sat over strange wines, about\r\na rumour that had reached my ears of a certain fleet of galleons of old\r\nSpain still said to be afloat in the South Seas in some uncharted region.\r\n\r\nIn this I was again to be disappointed. Talk was low and seldom, and I was\r\nabout to leave, when a sailor, wearing ear-rings of pure gold, lifted up\r\nhis head from his wine, and looking straight before him at the wall, told\r\nhis tale loudly:\r\n\r\n(When later on a storm of rain arose and thundered on the tavern\'s leaded\r\npanes, he raised his voice without effort and spoke on still. The darker\r\nit got the clearer his wild eyes shone.)\r\n\r\n"A ship with sails of the olden time was nearing fantastic isles. We had\r\nnever seen such isles.\r\n\r\n"We all hated the captain, and he hated us. He hated us all alike, there\r\nwas no favouritism about him. And he never would talk a word with any of\r\nus, except sometimes in the evening when it was getting dark he would stop\r\nand look up and talk a bit to the men he had hanged at the yard-arm.\r\n\r\n"We were a mutinous crew. But Captain was the only man that had pistols.\r\nHe slept with one under his pillow and kept one close beside him. There\r\nwas a nasty look about the isles. They were small and flat as though they\r\nhad come up only recently from the sea, and they had no sand or rocks like\r\nhonest isles, but green grass down to the water. And there were little\r\ncottages there whose looks we did not like. Their thatches came almost\r\ndown to the ground, and were strangely turned up at the corners, and under\r\nthe low eaves were queer dark windows whose little leaded panes were too\r\nthick to see through. And no one, man or beast, was walking about, so that\r\nyou could not know what kind of people lived there. But Captain knew. And\r\nhe went ashore and into one of the cottages, and someone lit lights\r\ninside, and the little windows wore an evil look.\r\n\r\n"It was quite dark when he came aboard again, and he bade a cheery\r\ngood-night to the men that swung from the yard-arm and he eyed us in a way\r\nthat frightened poor old Bill.\r\n\r\n"Next night we found that he had learned to curse, for he came on a lot of\r\nus asleep in our bunks, and among them poor old Bill, and he pointed at us\r\nwith a finger, and made a curse that our souls should stay all night at\r\nthe top of the masts. And suddenly there was the soul of poor old Bill\r\nsitting like a monkey at the top of the mast, and looking at the stars,\r\nand freezing through and through.\r\n\r\n"We got up a little mutiny after that, but Captain comes up and points\r\nwith his finger again, and this time poor old Bill and all the rest are\r\nswimming behind the ship through the cold green water, though their bodies\r\nremain on deck.\r\n\r\n"It was the cabin-boy who found out that Captain couldn\'t curse when he\r\nwas drunk, though he could shoot as well at one time as another.\r\n\r\n"After that it was only a matter of waiting, and of losing two men when\r\nthe time came. Some of us were murderous fellows, and wanted to kill\r\nCaptain, but poor old Bill was for finding a bit of an island, out of the\r\ntrack of ships, and leaving him there with his share of our year\'s\r\nprovisions. And everybody listened to poor old Bill, and we decided to\r\nmaroon Captain as soon as we caught him when he couldn\'t curse.\r\n\r\n"It was three whole days before Captain got drunk again, and poor old Bill\r\nand all had a dreadful time, for Captain invented new curses every day,\r\nand wherever he pointed his finger our souls had to go; and the fishes got\r\nto know us, and so did the stars, and none of them pitied us when we froze\r\non the masts or were hurried through forests of seaweed and lost our\r\nway--both stars and fishes went about their businesses with cold,\r\nunastonished eyes. Once when the sun had set and it was twilight, and the\r\nmoon was showing clearer and clearer in the sky, and we stopped our work\r\nfor a moment because Captain seemed to be looking away from us at the\r\ncolours in the sky, he suddenly turned and sent our souls to the Moon. And\r\nit was colder there than ice at night; and there were horrible mountains\r\nmaking shadows; and it was all as silent as miles of tombs; and Earth was\r\nshining up in the sky as big as the blade of a scythe, and we all got\r\nhomesick for it, but could not speak nor cry. It was quite dark when we\r\ngot back, and we were very respectful to Captain all the next day, but he\r\ncursed several of us again very soon. What we all feared most was that he\r\nwould curse our souls to Hell, and none of us mentioned Hell above a\r\nwhisper for fear that it should remind him. But on the third evening the\r\ncabin-boy came and told us that Captain was drunk. And we all went to his\r\ncabin, and we found him lying there across his bunk, and he shot as he had\r\nnever shot before; but he had no more than the two pistols, and he would\r\nonly have killed two men if he hadn\'t caught Joe over the head with the\r\nend of one of his pistols. And then we tied him up. And poor old Bill put\r\nthe rum between the Captain\'s teeth, and kept him drunk for two days, so\r\nthat he could not curse, till we found a convenient rock. And before\r\nsunset of the second day we found a nice bare island for Captain, out of\r\nthe track of ships, about a hundred yards long and about eighty wide; and\r\nwe rowed him along to it in a little boat, and gave him provisions for a\r\nyear, the same as we had ourselves, because poor old Bill wanted to be\r\nfair. And we left him sitting comfortable with his back to a rock singing\r\na sailor\'s song.\r\n\r\n"When we could no longer hear Captain singing we all grew very cheerful\r\nand made a banquet out of our year\'s provisions, as we all hoped to be\r\nhome again in under three weeks. We had three great banquets every day for\r\na week--every man had more than he could eat, and what was left over we\r\nthrew on the floor like gentlemen. And then one day, as we saw San\r\nHu\xebg\xe9dos, and wanted to sail in to spend our money, the wind changed round\r\nfrom behind us and beat us out to sea. There was no tacking against it,\r\nand no getting into the harbour, though other ships sailed by us and\r\nanchored there. Sometimes a dead calm would fall on us, while fishing\r\nboats all around us flew before half a gale, and sometimes the wind would\r\nbeat us out to sea when nothing else was moving. All day we tried, and at\r\nnight we laid to and tried again the next day. And all the sailors of the\r\nother ships were spending their money in San Hu\xebg\xe9dos and we could not\r\ncome nigh it. Then we spoke horrible things against the wind and against\r\nSan Hu\xebg\xe9dos, and sailed away.\r\n\r\n"It was just the same at Norenna.\r\n\r\n"We kept close together now and talked in low voices. Suddenly poor old\r\nBill grew frightened. As we went all along the Siractic coast-line, we\r\ntried again and again, and the wind was waiting for us in every harbour\r\nand sent us out to sea. Even the little islands would not have us. And\r\nthen we knew that there was no landing yet for poor old Bill, and every\r\none upbraided his kind heart that had made them maroon Captain on a rock,\r\nso as not to have his blood upon their heads. There was nothing to do but\r\nto drift about the seas. There were no banquets now, because we feared\r\nthat Captain might live his year and keep us out to sea.\r\n\r\n"At first we used to hail all passing ships, and used to try to board them\r\nin the boats; but there was no towing against Captain\'s curse, and we had\r\nto give that up. So we played cards for a year in Captain\'s cabin, night\r\nand day, storm and fine, and every one promised to pay poor old Bill when\r\nwe got ashore.\r\n\r\n"It was horrible to us to think what a frugal man Captain really was, he\r\nthat used to get drunk every other day whenever he was at sea, and here he\r\nwas still alive, and sober too, for his curse still kept us out of every\r\nport, and our provisions were gone.\r\n\r\n"Well, it came to drawing lots, and Jim was the unlucky one. Jim only kept\r\nus about three days, and then we drew lots again, and this time it was the\r\nnigger. The nigger didn\'t keep us any longer, and we drew again, and this\r\ntime it was Charlie, and still Captain was alive.\r\n\r\n"As we got fewer one of us kept us longer. Longer and longer a mate used\r\nto last us, and we all wondered how ever Captain did it. It was five weeks\r\nover the year when we drew Mike, and he kept us for a week, and Captain\r\nwas still alive. We wondered he didn\'t get tired of the same old curse;\r\nbut we supposed things looked different when one is alone on an island.\r\n\r\n"When there was only Jakes and poor old Bill and the cabin-boy and Dick,\r\nwe didn\'t draw any longer. We said that the cabin-boy had had all the\r\nluck, and he mustn\'t expect any more. Then poor old Bill was alone with\r\nJakes and Dick, and Captain was still alive. When there was no more boy,\r\nand the Captain still alive, Dick, who was a huge strong man like poor old\r\nBill, said that it was Jakes\' turn, and he was very lucky to have lived as\r\nlong as he had. But poor old Bill talked it all over with Jakes, and they\r\nthought it better than Dick should take his turn.\r\n\r\n"Then there was Jakes and poor old Bill; and Captain would not die.\r\n\r\n"And these two used to watch one another night and day, when Dick was gone\r\nand no one else was left to them. And at last poor old Bill fell down in a\r\nfaint and lay there for an hour. Then Jakes came up to him slowly with his\r\nknife, and makes a stab at poor old Bill as he lies there on the deck. And\r\npoor old Bill caught hold of him by the wrist, and put his knife into him\r\ntwice to make quite sure, although it spoiled the best part of the meat.\r\nThen poor old Bill was all alone at sea.\r\n\r\n"And the very next week, before the food gave out, Captain must have died\r\non his bit of an island; for poor old Bill heard the Captain\'s soul going\r\ncursing over the sea, and the day after that the ship was cast on a rocky\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n"And Captain\'s been dead now for over a hundred years, and poor old Bill\r\nis safe ashore again. But it looks as if Captain hadn\'t done with him yet,\r\nfor poor old Bill doesn\'t ever get any older, and somehow or other he\r\ndoesn\'t seem to die. Poor old Bill!"\r\n\r\nWhen this was over the man\'s fascination suddenly snapped, and we all\r\njumped up and left him.\r\n\r\nIt was not only his revolting story, but it was the fearful look in the\r\neyes of the man who told it, and the terrible ease with which his voice\r\nsurpassed the roar of the rain, that decided me never again to enter that\r\nhaunt of sailors--the tavern of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGGARS\r\n\r\n\r\nI was walking down Piccadilly not long ago, thinking of nursery rhymes and\r\nregretting old romance.\r\n\r\nAs I saw the shopkeepers walk by in their black frock-coats and their\r\nblack hats, I thought of the old line in nursery annals: "The merchants of\r\nLondon, they wear scarlet."\r\n\r\nThe streets were all so unromantic, dreary. Nothing could be done for\r\nthem, I thought--nothing. And then my thoughts were interrupted by barking\r\ndogs. Every dog in the street seemed to be barking--every kind of dog, not\r\nonly the little ones but the big ones too. They were all facing East\r\ntowards the way I was coming by. Then I turned round to look and had this\r\nvision, in Piccadilly, on the opposite side to the houses just after you\r\npass the cab-rank.\r\n\r\nTall bent men were coming down the street arrayed in marvelous cloaks. All\r\nwere sallow of skin and swarthy of hair, and most of them wore strange\r\nbeards. They were coming slowly, and they walked with staves, and their\r\nhands were out for alms.\r\n\r\nAll the beggars had come to town.\r\n\r\nI would have given them a gold doubloon engraven with the towers of\r\nCastile, but I had no such coin. They did not seem the people to who it\r\nwere fitting to offer the same coin as one tendered for the use of a\r\ntaxicab (O marvelous, ill-made word, surely the pass-word somewhere of\r\nsome evil order). Some of them wore purple cloaks with wide green borders,\r\nand the border of green was a narrow strip with some, and some wore cloaks\r\nof old and faded red, and some wore violet cloaks, and none wore black.\r\nAnd they begged gracefully, as gods might beg for souls.\r\n\r\nI stood by a lamp-post, and they came up to it, and one addressed it,\r\ncalling the lamp-post brother, and said, "O lamp-post, our brother of the\r\ndark, are there many wrecks by thee in the tides of night? Sleep not,\r\nbrother, sleep not. There were many wrecks an it were not for thee."\r\n\r\nIt was strange: I had not thought of the majesty of the street lamp and\r\nhis long watching over drifting men. But he was not beneath the notice of\r\nthese cloaked strangers.\r\n\r\nAnd then one murmured to the street: "Art thou weary, street? Yet a little\r\nlonger they shall go up and down, and keep thee clad with tar and wooden\r\nbricks. Be patient, street. In a while the earthquake cometh."\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" people said. "And where do you come from?"\r\n\r\n"Who may tell what we are," they answered, "or whence we come?"\r\n\r\nAnd one turned towards the smoke-stained houses, saying, "Blessed be the\r\nhouses, because men dream therein."\r\n\r\nThen I perceived, what I had never thought, that all these staring houses\r\nwere not alike, but different one from another, because they held\r\ndifferent dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd another turned to a tree that stood by the Green Park railings,\r\nsaying, "Take comfort, tree, for the fields shall come again."\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the ugly smoke went upwards, the smoke that has stifled\r\nRomance and blackened the birds. This, I thought, they can neither praise\r\nnor bless. And when they saw it they raised their hands towards it,\r\ntowards the thousand chimneys, saying, "Behold the smoke. The old\r\ncoal-forests that have lain so long in the dark, and so long still, are\r\ndancing now and going back to the sun. Forget not Earth, O our brother,\r\nand we wish thee joy of the sun."\r\n\r\nIt had rained, and a cheerless stream dropped down a dirty gutter. It had\r\ncome from heaps of refuse, foul and forgotten; it had gathered upon its\r\nway things that were derelict, and went to somber drains unknown to man or\r\nthe sun. It was this sullen stream as much as all other causes that had\r\nmade me say in my heart that the town was vile, that Beauty was dead in\r\nit, and Romance fled.\r\n\r\nEven this thing they blessed. And one that wore a purple cloak with broad\r\ngreen border, said, "Brother, be hopeful yet, for thou shalt surely come\r\nat last to the delectable Sea, and meet the heaving, huge, and travelled\r\nships, and rejoice by isles that know the golden sun." Even thus they\r\nblessed the gutter, and I felt no whim to mock.\r\n\r\nAnd the people that went by, in their black unseemly coats and their\r\nmisshapen, monstrous, shiny hats, the beggars also blessed. And one of\r\nthem said to one of these dark citizens: "O twin of Night himself, with\r\nthy specks of white at wrist and neck like to Night\'s scattered stars. How\r\nfearfully thou dost veil with black thy hid, unguessed desires. They are\r\ndeep thoughts in thee that they will not frolic with colour, that they say\r\n\'No\' to purple, and to lovely green \'Begone.\' Thou hast wild fancies that\r\nthey must needs be tamed with black, and terrible imaginings that they\r\nmust be hidden thus. Has thy soul dreams of the angels, and of the walls\r\nof fa\xebry that thou hast guarded it so utterly, lest it dazzle astonished\r\neyes? Even so God hid the diamond deep down in miles of clay.\r\n\r\n"The wonder of thee is not marred by mirth.\r\n\r\n"Behold thou art very secret.\r\n\r\n"Be wonderful. Be full of mystery."\r\n\r\nSilently the man in the black frock-coat passed on. And I came to\r\nunderstand when the purple beggar had spoken, that the dark citizen had\r\ntrafficked perhaps with Ind, that in his heart were strange and dumb\r\nambitions; that his dumbness was founded by solemn rite on the roots of\r\nancient tradition; that it might be overcome one day by a cheer in the\r\nstreet or by some one singing a song, and that when this shopman spoke\r\nthere might come clefts in the world and people peering over at the abyss.\r\n\r\nThen turning towards Green Park, where as yet Spring was not, the beggars\r\nstretched out their hands, and looking at the frozen grass and the yet\r\nunbudding trees they, chanting all together, prophesied daffodils.\r\n\r\nA motor omnibus came down the street, nearly running over some of the dogs\r\nthat were barking ferociously still. It was sounding its horn noisily.\r\n\r\nAnd the vision went then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In a letter from a friend whom I have never seen, one of those that read\r\nmy books, this line was quoted--"But he, he never came to Carcassonne." I\r\ndo not know the origin of the line, but I made this tale about it._\r\n\r\n\r\nCARCASSONNE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Camorak reigned at Arn, and the world was fairer, he gave a festival\r\nto all the weald to commemorate the splendour of his youth.\r\n\r\nThey say that his house at Arn was huge and high, and its ceiling painted\r\nblue; and when evening fell men would climb up by ladders and light the\r\nscores of candles hanging from slender chains. And they say, too, that\r\nsometimes a cloud would come, and pour in through the top of one of the\r\noriel windows, and it would come over the edge of the stonework as the\r\nsea-mist comes over a sheer cliffs shaven lip where an old wind has blown\r\nfor ever and ever (he has swept away thousands of leaves and thousands of\r\ncenturies, they are all one to him, he owes no allegiance to Time). And\r\nthe cloud would re-shape itself in the hall\'s lofty vault and drift on\r\nthrough it slowly, and out to the sky again through another window. And\r\nfrom its shape the knights in Camorak\'s hall would prophesy the battles\r\nand sieges of the next season of war. They say of the hall of Camorak at\r\nArn that there hath been none like it in any land, and foretell that there\r\nwill be never.\r\n\r\nHither had come in the folk of the Weald from sheepfold and from forest,\r\nrevolving slow thoughts of food, and shelter, and love, and they sat down\r\nwondering in that famous hall; and therein also were seated the men of\r\nArn, the town that clustered round the King\'s high house, and all was\r\nroofed with red, maternal earth.\r\n\r\nIf old songs may be trusted, it was a marvelous hall.\r\n\r\nMany who sat there could only have seen it distantly before, a clear shape\r\nin the landscape, but smaller than a hill. Now they beheld along the wall\r\nthe weapons of Camorak\'s men, of which already the lute-players made\r\nsongs, and tales were told at evening in the byres. There they described\r\nthe shield of Camorak that had gone to and fro across so many battles, and\r\nthe sharp but dinted edges of his sword; there were the weapons of Gadriol\r\nthe Leal, and Norn, and Athoric of the Sleety Sword, Heriel the Wild,\r\nYarold, and Thanga of Esk, their arms hung evenly all round the hall, low\r\nwhere a man could reach them; and in the place of honour in the midst,\r\nbetween the arms of Camorak and of Gadriol the Leal, hung the harp of\r\nArleon. And of all the weapons hanging on those walls none were more\r\ncalamitous to Camorak\'s foes than was the harp of Arleon. For to a man\r\nthat goes up against a strong place on foot, pleasant indeed is the twang\r\nand jolt of some fearful engine of war that his fellow-warriors are\r\nworking behind him, from which huge rocks go sighing over his head and\r\nplunge among his foes; and pleasant to a warrior in the wavering light are\r\nthe swift commands of his King, and a joy to him are his comrades\' instant\r\ncheers exulting suddenly at a turn of the war. All this and more was the\r\nharp to Camorak\'s men; for not only would it cheer his warriors on, but\r\nmany a time would Arleon of the Harp strike wild amazement into opposing\r\nhosts by some rapturous prophecy suddenly shouted out while his hand swept\r\nover the roaring strings. Moreover, no war was ever declared till Camorak\r\nand his men had listened long to the harp, and were elate with the music\r\nand mad against peace. Once Arleon, for the sake of a rhyme, had made war\r\nupon Estabonn; and an evil king was overthrown, and honour and glory won;\r\nfrom such queer motives does good sometimes accrue.\r\n\r\nAbove the shields and the harps all round the hall were the painted\r\nfigures of heroes of fabulous famous songs. Too trivial, because too\r\neasily surpassed by Camorak\'s men, seemed all the victories that the earth\r\nhad known; neither was any trophy displayed of Camorak\'s seventy battles,\r\nfor these were as nothing to his warriors or him compared with those\r\nthings that their youth had dreamed and which they mightily purposed yet\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nAbove the painted pictures there was darkness, for evening was closing in,\r\nand the candles swinging on their slender chain were not yet lit in the\r\nroof; it was as though a piece of the night had been builded into the\r\nedifice like a huge natural rock that juts into a house. And there sat all\r\nthe warriors of Arn and the Weald-folk wondering at them; and none were\r\nmore than thirty, and all were skilled in war. And Camorak sat at the head\r\nof all, exulting in his youth.\r\n\r\nWe must wrestle with Time for some seven decades, and he is a weak and\r\npuny antagonist in the first three bouts.\r\n\r\nNow there was present at this feast a diviner, one who knew the schemes of\r\nFate, and he sat among the people of the Weald and had no place of honour,\r\nfor Camorak and his men had no fear of Fate. And when the meat was eaten\r\nand the bones cast aside, the king rose up from his chair, and having\r\ndrunken wine, and being in the glory of his youth and with all his knights\r\nabout him, called to the diviner, saying, "Prophesy."\r\n\r\nAnd the diviner rose up, stroking his grey beard, and spake\r\nguardedly--"There are certain events," he said, "upon the ways of Fate\r\nthat are veiled even from a diviner\'s eyes, and many more are clear to us\r\nthat were better veiled from all; much I know that is better unforetold,\r\nand some things that I may not foretell on pain of centuries of\r\npunishment. But this I know and foretell--that you will never come to\r\nCarcassonne."\r\n\r\nInstantly there was a buzz of talk telling of Carcassonne--some had heard\r\nof it in speech or song, some had read of it, and some had dreamed of it.\r\nAnd the king sent Arleon of the Harp down from his right hand to mingle\r\nwith the Weald-folk to hear aught that any told of Carcassonne. But the\r\nwarriors told of the places they had won to--many a hard-held fortress,\r\nmany a far-off land, and swore that they would come to Carcassonne.\r\n\r\nAnd in a while came Arleon back to the king\'s right hand, and raised his\r\nharp and chanted and told of Carcassonne. Far away it was, and far and far\r\naway, a city of gleaming ramparts rising one over other, and marble\r\nterraces behind the ramparts, and fountains shimmering on the terraces. To\r\nCarcassonne the elf-kings with their fairies had first retreated from men,\r\nand had built it on an evening late in May by blowing their elfin horns.\r\nCarcassonne! Carcassonne!\r\n\r\nTravellers had seen it sometimes like a clear dream, with the sun\r\nglittering on its citadel upon a far-off hilltop, and then the clouds had\r\ncome or a sudden mist; no one had seen it long or come quite close to it;\r\nthough once there were some men that came very near, and the smoke from\r\nthe houses blew into their faces, a sudden gust--no more, and these\r\ndeclared that some one was burning cedarwood there. Men had dreamed that\r\nthere is a witch there, walking alone through the cold courts and\r\ncorridors of marmorean palaces, fearfully beautiful and still for all her\r\nfourscore centuries, singing the second oldest song, which was taught her\r\nby the sea, shedding tears for loneliness from eyes that would madden\r\narmies, yet will she not call her dragons home--Carcassonne is terribly\r\nguarded. Sometimes she swims in a marble bath through whose deeps a river\r\ntumbles, or lies all morning on the edge of it to dry slowly in the sun,\r\nand watches the heaving river trouble the deeps of the bath. It flows\r\nthrough the caverns of earth for further than she knows, and coming to\r\nlight in the witch\'s bath goes down through the earth again to its own\r\npeculiar sea.\r\n\r\nIn autumn sometimes it comes down black with snow that spring has molten\r\nin unimagined mountains, or withered blooms of mountain shrubs go\r\nbeautifully by.\r\n\r\nWhen there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains;\r\nand yet she knows not where those mountains are.\r\n\r\nWhen she sings the fountains dance up from the dark earth, when she combs\r\nher hair they say there are storms at sea, when she is angry the wolves\r\ngrow brave and all come down to the byres, when she is sad the sea is sad,\r\nand both are sad for ever. Carcassonne! Carcassonne!\r\n\r\nThis city is the fairest of the wonders of Morning; the sun shouts when he\r\nbeholdeth it; for Carcassonne Evening weepeth when Evening passeth away.\r\n\r\nAnd Arleon told how many goodly perils were round about the city, and how\r\nthe way was unknown, and it was a knightly venture. Then all the warriors\r\nstood up and sang of the splendour of the venture. And Camorak swore by\r\nthe gods that had builded Arn, and by the honour of his warriors that,\r\nalive or dead, he would come to Carcassonne.\r\n\r\nBut the diviner rose and passed out of the hall, brushing the crumbs from\r\nhim with his hands and smoothing his robe as he went.\r\n\r\nThen Camorak said, "There are many things to be planned, and counsels to\r\nbe taken, and provender to be gathered. Upon what day shall we start?" And\r\nall the warriors answering shouted, "Now." And Camorak smiled thereat, for\r\nhe had but tried them. Down then from the walls they took their weapons,\r\nSikorix, Kelleron, Aslof, Wole of the Axe; Huhenoth, Peace-breaker;\r\nWolwuf, Father of War; Tarion, Lurth of the Warcry and many another.\r\nLittle then dreamed the spiders that sat in that ringing hall of the\r\nunmolested leisure they were soon to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhen they were armed they all formed up and marched out of the hall, and\r\nArleon strode before them singing of Carcassonne.\r\n\r\nBut the talk of the Weald arose and went back well fed to byres. They had\r\nno need of wars or of rare perils. They were ever at war with hunger. A\r\nlong drought or hard winter were to them pitched battles; if the wolves\r\nentered a sheep-fold it was like the loss of a fortress, a thunder-storm\r\non the harvest was like an ambuscade. Well-fed, they went back slowly to\r\ntheir byres, being at truce with hunger; and the night filled with stars.\r\n\r\nAnd black against the starry sky appeared the round helms of the warriors\r\nas they passed the tops of the ridges, but in the valleys they sparkled\r\nnow and then as the starlight flashed on steel.\r\n\r\nThey followed behind Arleon going south, whence rumours had always come of\r\nCarcassonne: so they marched in the starlight, and he before them singing.\r\n\r\nWhen they had marched so far that they heard no sound from Arn, and even\r\ninaudible were her swinging bells, when candles burning late far up in\r\ntowers no longer sent them their disconsolate welcome; in the midst of the\r\npleasant night that lulls the rural spaces, weariness came upon Arleon and\r\nhis inspiration failed. It failed slowly. Gradually he grew less sure of\r\nthe way to Carcassonne. Awhile he stopped to think, and remembered the way\r\nagain; but his clear certainty was gone, and in its place were efforts in\r\nhis mind to recall old prophecies and shepherd\'s songs that told of the\r\nmarvelous city. Then as he said over carefully to himself a song that a\r\nwanderer had learnt from a goatherd\'s boy far up the lower slope of\r\nultimate southern mountains, fatigue came down upon his toiling mind like\r\nsnow on the winding ways of a city noisy by night, stilling all.\r\n\r\nHe stood, and the warriors closed up to him. For long they had passed by\r\ngreat oaks standing solitary here and there, like giants taking huge\r\nbreaths of the night air before doing some furious deed; now they had come\r\nto the verge of a black forest; the tree-trunks stood like those great\r\ncolumns in an Egyptian hall whence God in an older mood received the\r\npraise of men; the top of it sloped the way of an ancient wind. Here they\r\nall halted and lighted a fire of branches, striking sparks from flint into\r\na heap of bracken. They eased them of their armour, and sat round the\r\nfire, and Camorak stood up there and addressed them, and Camorak said: "We\r\ngo to war with Fate, who has doomed that I shall not come to Carcassonne.\r\nAnd if we turn aside but one of the dooms of Fate, then the whole future\r\nof the world is ours, and the future that Fate has ordered is like the dry\r\ncourse of an averted river. But if such men as we, such resolute\r\nconquerors, cannot prevent one doom that Fate has planned, then is the\r\nrace of man enslaved for ever to do its petty and allotted task."\r\n\r\nThen they all drew their swords, and waved them high in the firelight, and\r\ndeclared war on Fate.\r\n\r\nNothing in the somber forest stirred or made any sound.\r\n\r\nTired men do not dream of war. When morning came over the gleaming fields\r\na company that had set out from Arn discovered the discovered the\r\ncamping-place of the warriors, and brought pavilions and provender. And\r\nthe warriors feasted, and the birds in the forest sang, and the\r\ninspiration of Arleon awoke.\r\n\r\nThen they rose, and following Arleon, entered the forest, and marched away\r\nto the South. And many a woman of Arn sent her thoughts with them as they\r\nplayed alone some old monotonous tune, but their own thoughts were far\r\nbefore them, skimming over the bath through whose deeps the river tumbles\r\nin marble Carcassonne.\r\n\r\nWhen butterflies were dancing on the air, and the sun neared the zenith,\r\npavilions were pitched, and all the warriors rested; and then they feasted\r\nagain, and then played knightly games, and late in the afternoon marched\r\non once more, singing of Carcassonne.\r\n\r\nAnd night came down with its mystery on the forest, and gave their\r\ndemoniac look again to the trees, and rolled up out of misty hollows a\r\nhuge and yellow moon.\r\n\r\nAnd the men of Arn lit fires, and sudden shadows arose and leaped\r\nfantastically away. And the night-wind blew, arising like a ghost, and\r\npassed between the tree trunks, and slipped down shimmering glades, and\r\nwaked the prowling beasts still dreaming of day, and drifted nocturnal\r\nbirds afield to menace timorous things, and beat the roses of the\r\nbefriending night, and wafted to the ears of wandering men the sound of a\r\nmaiden\'s song, and gave a glamour to the lutanist\'s tune played in his\r\nloneliness on distant hills; and the deep eyes of moths glowed like a\r\ngalleon\'s lamps, and they spread their wings and sailed their familiar\r\nsea. Upon this night-wind also the dreams of Camorak\'s men floated to\r\nCarcassonne.\r\n\r\nAll the next morning they marched, and all the evening, and knew they were\r\nnearing now the deeps of the forest. And the citizens of Arn kept close\r\ntogether and close behind the warriors. For the deeps of the forest were\r\nall unknown to travellers, but not unknown to those tales of fear that men\r\ntell at evening to their friends, in the comfort and the safety of their\r\nhearths. Then night appeared, and an enormous moon. And the men of Camorak\r\nslept. Sometimes they woke, and went to sleep again; and those that stayed\r\nawake for long and listened heard heavy two-footed creatures pad through\r\nthe night on paws.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was light the unarmed men of Arn began to slip away, and\r\nwent back by bands through the forest. When darkness came they did not\r\nstop to sleep, but continued their flight straight on until they came to\r\nArn, and added there by the tales they told to the terror of the forest.\r\n\r\nBut the warriors feasted, and afterwards Arleon rose, and played his harp,\r\nand led them on again; and a few faithful servants stayed with them still.\r\nAnd they marched all day through a gloom that was as old as night, but\r\nArleon\'s inspiration burned in his mind like a star. And he led them till\r\nthe birds began to drop into the treetops, and it was evening and they all\r\nencamped. They had only one pavilion left to them now, and near it they\r\nlit a fire, and Camorak posted a sentry with drawn sword just beyond the\r\nglow of the firelight. Some of the warriors slept in the pavilion and\r\nothers round about it.\r\n\r\nWhen dawn came something terrible had killed and eaten the sentry. But the\r\nsplendour of the rumours of Carcassonne and Fate\'s decree that they should\r\nnever come there, and the inspiration of Arleon and his harp, all urged\r\nthe warriors on; and they marched deeper and deeper all day into the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nOnce they saw a dragon that had caught a bear and was playing with it,\r\nletting it run a little way and overtaking it with a paw.\r\n\r\nThey came at last to a clear space in the forest just before nightfall. An\r\nodour of flowers arose from it like a mist, and every drop of dew\r\ninterpreted heaven unto itself.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour when twilight kisses Earth.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour when a meaning comes into senseless things, and trees\r\nout-majesty the pomp of monarchs, and the timid creatures steal abroad to\r\nfeed, and as yet the beasts of prey harmlessly dream, and Earth utters a\r\nsigh, and it is night.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the wide clearing Camorak\'s warriors camped, and rejoiced\r\nto see stars again appearing one by one.\r\n\r\nThat night they ate the last of their provisions, and slept unmolested by\r\nthe prowling things that haunt the gloom of the forest.\r\n\r\nOn the next day some of the warriors hunted stags, and others lay in\r\nrushes by a neighbouring lake and shot arrows at water-fowl. One stag was\r\nkilled, and some geese, and several teal.\r\n\r\nHere the adventurers stayed, breathing the pure wild air that cities know\r\nnot; by day they hunted, and lit fires by night, and sang and feasted, and\r\nforgot Carcassonne. The terrible denizens of the gloom never molested\r\nthem, venison was plentiful, and all manner of water-fowl: they loved the\r\nchase by day, and by night their favourite songs. Thus day after day went\r\nby, thus week after week. Time flung over this encampment a handful of\r\nmoons, the gold and silver moons that waste the year away; Autumn and\r\nWinter passed, and Spring appeared; and still the warriors hunted and\r\nfeasted there.\r\n\r\nOne night of the springtide they were feasting about a fire and telling\r\ntales of the chase, and the soft moths came out of the dark and flaunted\r\ntheir colours in the firelight, and went out grey into the dark again; and\r\nthe night wind was cool upon the warriors\' necks, and the camp-fire was\r\nwarm in their faces, and a silence had settled among them after some song,\r\nand Arleon all at once rose suddenly up, remembering Carcassonne. And his\r\nhand swept over the strings of his harp, awaking the deeper chords, like\r\nthe sound of a nimble people dancing their steps on bronze, and the music\r\nrolled away into the night\'s own silence, and the voice of Arleon rose:\r\n\r\n"When there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains\r\nand longs for the battle-shout of kingly men."\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly all shouted, "Carcassonne!" And at that word their idleness\r\nwas gone as a dream is gone from a dreamer waked with a shout. And soon\r\nthe great march began that faltered no more nor wavered. Unchecked by\r\nbattles, undaunted in lonesome spaces, ever unwearied by the vulturous\r\nyears, the warriors of Camorak held on; and Arleon\'s inspiration led them\r\nstill. They cleft with the music of Arleon\'s harp the gloom of ancient\r\nsilences; they went singing into battles with terrible wild men, and came\r\nout singing, but with fewer voices; they came to villages in valleys full\r\nof the music of bells, or saw the lights at dusk of cottages sheltering\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThey became a proverb for wandering, and a legend arose of strange,\r\ndisconsolate men. Folks spoke of them at nightfall when the fire was warm\r\nand rain slipped down the eaves; and when the wind was high small children\r\nfeared the Men Who Would Not Rest were going clattering past. Strange\r\ntales were told of men in old grey armour moving at twilight along the\r\ntops of the hills and never asking shelter; and mothers told their boys\r\nwho grew impatient of home that the grey wanderers were once so impatient\r\nand were now hopeless of rest, and were driven along with the rain\r\nwhenever the wind was angry.\r\n\r\nBut the wanderers were cheered in their wandering by the hope of coming to\r\nCarcassonne, and later on by anger against Fate, and at last they marched\r\non still because it seemed better to march on than to think.\r\n\r\nFor many years they had wandered and had fought with many tribes; often\r\nthey gathered legends in villages and listened to idle singers singing\r\nsongs; and all the rumours of Carcassonne still came from the South.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day they came to a hilly land with a legend in it that only\r\nthree valleys away a man might see, on clear days, Carcassonne. Tired\r\nthough they were and few, and worn with the years which had all brought\r\nthem wars, they pushed on instantly, led still by Arleon\'s inspiration\r\nwhich dwindled in his age, though he made music with his old harp still.\r\n\r\nAll day they climbed down into the first valley and for two days ascended,\r\nand came to the Town That May Not Be Taken In War below the top of the\r\nmountain, and its gates were shut against them, and there was no way\r\nround. To left and right steep precipices stood for as far as eye could\r\nsee or legend tell of, and the pass lay through the city. Therefore\r\nCamorak drew up his remaining warriors in line of battle to wage their\r\nlast war, and they stepped forward over the crisp bones of old, unburied\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nNo sentinel defied them in the gate, no arrow flew from any tower of war.\r\nOne citizen climbed alone to the mountain\'s top, and the rest hid\r\nthemselves in sheltered places.\r\n\r\nNow, in the top of the mountain was a deep, bowl-like cavern in the rock,\r\nin which fires bubbled softly. But if any cast a boulder into the fires,\r\nas it was the custom for one of those citizens to do when enemies\r\napproached them, the mountain hurled up intermittent rocks for three days,\r\nand the rocks fell flaming all over the town and all round about it. And\r\njust as Camorak\'s men began to batter the gate they heard a crash on the\r\nmountain, and a great rock fell beyond them and rolled into the valley.\r\nThe next two fell in front of them on the iron roofs of the town. Just as\r\nthey entered the town a rock found them crowded in a narrow street, and\r\nshattered two of them. The mountain smoked and panted; with every pant a\r\nrock plunged into the streets or bounced along the heavy iron roof, and\r\nthe smoke went slowly up, and up, and up.\r\n\r\nWhen they had come through the long town\'s empty streets to the locked\r\ngate at the end, only fifteen were left. When they had broken down the\r\ngate there were only ten alive. Three more were killed as they went up the\r\nslope, and two as they passed near the terrible cavern. Fate let the rest\r\ngo some way down the mountain upon the other side, and then took three of\r\nthem. Camorak and Arleon alone were left alive. And night came down on the\r\nvalley to which they had come, and was lit by flashes from the fatal\r\nmountain; and the two mourned for their comrades all night long.\r\n\r\nBut when the morning came they remembered their war with Fate, and their\r\nold resolve to come to Carcassonne, and the voice of Arleon rose in a\r\nquavering song, and snatches of music from his old harp, and he stood up\r\nand marched with his face southwards as he had done for years, and behind\r\nhim Camorak went. And when at last they climbed from the third valley, and\r\nstood on the hill\'s summit in the golden sunlight of evening, their aged\r\neyes saw only miles of forest and the birds going to roost.\r\n\r\nTheir beards were white, and they had travelled very far and hard; it was\r\nthe time with them when a man rests from labours and dreams in light sleep\r\nof the years that were and not of the years to come.\r\n\r\nLong they looked southwards; and the sun set over remoter forests, and\r\nglow-worms lit their lamps, and the inspiration of Arleon rose and flew\r\naway for ever, to gladden, perhaps, the dreams of younger men.\r\n\r\nAnd Arleon said: "My King, I know no longer the way to Carcassonne."\r\n\r\nAnd Camorak smiled, as the aged smile, with little cause for mirth, and\r\nsaid: "The years are going by us like huge birds, whom Doom and Destiny\r\nand the schemes of God have frightened up out of some old grey marsh. And\r\nit may well be that against these no warrior may avail, and that Fate has\r\nconquered us, and that our quest has failed."\r\n\r\nAnd after this they were silent.\r\n\r\nThen they drew their swords, and side by side went down into the forest,\r\nstill seeking Carcassonne.\r\n\r\nI think they got not far; for there were deadly marshes in that forest,\r\nand gloom that outlasted the nights, and fearful beasts accustomed to its\r\nways. Neither is there any legend, either in verse or among the songs of\r\nthe people of the fields, of any having come to Carcassonne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN ZACCARATH\r\n\r\n\r\n"Come," said the King in sacred Zaccarath, "and let our prophets prophesy\r\nbefore us."\r\n\r\nA far-seen jewel of light was the holy palace, a wonder to the nomads on\r\nthe plains.\r\n\r\nThere was the King with all his underlords, and the lesser kings that did\r\nhim vassalage, and there were all his queens with all their jewels upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWho shall tell of the splendour in which they sat; of the thousand lights\r\nand the answering emeralds; of the dangerous beauty of that hoard of\r\nqueens, or the flash of their laden necks?\r\n\r\nThere was a necklace there of rose-pink pearls beyond the art of the\r\ndreamer to imagine. Who shall tell of the amethyst chandeliers, where\r\ntorches, soaked in rare Bhyrinian oils, burned and gave off a scent of\r\nblethany?\r\n\r\n(This herb marvellous, which, growing near the summit of Mount Zaumnos,\r\nscents all the Zaumnian range, and is smelt far out on the Kepuscran\r\nplains, and even, when the wind is from the mountains, in the streets of\r\nthe city of Ognoth. At night it closes its petals and is heard to breathe,\r\nand its breath is a swift poison. This it does even by day if the snows\r\nare disturbed about it. No plant of this has ever been captured alive by a\r\nhunter.)\r\n\r\nEnough to say that when the dawn came up it appeared by contrast pallid\r\nand unlovely and stripped bare of all its glory, so that it hid itself\r\nwith rolling clouds.\r\n\r\n"Come," said the King, "let our prophets prophesy."\r\n\r\nThen the heralds stepped through the ranks of the King\'s silk-clad\r\nwarriors who lay oiled and scented upon velvet cloaks, with a pleasant\r\nbreeze among them caused by the fans of slaves; even their casting-spears\r\nwere set with jewels; through their ranks the heralds went with mincing\r\nsteps, and came to the prophets, clad in brown and black, and one of them\r\nthey brought and set him before the King. And the King looked at him and\r\nsaid, "Prophesy unto us."\r\n\r\nAnd the prophet lifted his head, so that his beard came clear from his\r\nbrown cloak, and the fans of the slaves that fanned the warriors wafted\r\nthe tip of it a little awry. And he spake to the King, and spake thus:\r\n\r\n"Woe unto thee, King, and woe unto Zaccarath. Woe unto thee, and woe unto\r\nthy women, for your fall shall be sore and soon. Already in Heaven the\r\ngods shun thy god: they know his doom and what is written of him: he sees\r\noblivion before him like a mist. Thou hast aroused the hate of the\r\nmountaineers. They hate thee all along the crags of Droom. The evilness of\r\nthy days shall bring down the Zeedians on thee as the suns of springtide\r\nbring the avalanche down. They shall do unto Zaccarath as the avalanche\r\ndoth unto the hamlets of the valley." When the queens chattered or\r\ntittered among themselves, he merely raised his voice and still spake on:\r\n"Woe to these walls and the carven things upon them. The hunter shall know\r\nthe camping-places of the nomads by the marks of the camp-fires on the\r\nplain, but he shall not know the place of Zaccarath."\r\n\r\nA few of the recumbent warriors turned their heads to glance at the\r\nprophet when he ceased. Far overhead the echoes of his voice hummed on\r\nawhile among the cedarn rafters.\r\n\r\n"Is he not splendid?" said the King. And many of that assembly beat with\r\ntheir palms upon the polished floor in token of applause. Then the prophet\r\nwas conducted back to his place at the far end of that mighty hall, and\r\nfor a while musicians played on marvellous curved horns, while drums\r\nthrobbed behind them hidden in a recess. The musicians were sitting\r\ncrosslegged on the floor, all blowing their huge horns in the brilliant\r\ntorchlight, but as the drums throbbed louder in the dark they arose and\r\nmoved slowly nearer to the King. Louder and louder drummed the drums in\r\nthe dark, and nearer and nearer moved the men with the horns, so that\r\ntheir music should not be drowned by the drums before it reached the King.\r\n\r\nA marvellous scene it was when the tempestuous horns were halted before\r\nthe King, and the drums in the dark were like the thunder of God; and the\r\nqueens were nodding their heads in time to the music, with their diadems\r\nflashing like heavens of falling stars; and the warriors lifted their\r\nheads and shook, as they lifted them, the plumes of those golden birds\r\nwhich hunters wait for by the Liddian lakes, in a whole lifetime killing\r\nscarcely six, to make the crests that the warriors wore when they feasted\r\nin Zaccarath. Then the King shouted and the warriors sang--almost they\r\nremembered then old battle-chants. And, as they sang, the sound of the\r\ndrums dwindled, and the musicians walked away backwards, and the drumming\r\nbecame fainter and fainter as they walked, and altogether ceased, and they\r\nblew no more on their fantastic horns. Then the assemblage beat on the\r\nfloor with their palms. And afterwards the queens besought the King to\r\nsend for another prophet. And the heralds brought a singer, and placed him\r\nbefore the King; and the singer was a young man with a harp. And he swept\r\nthe strings of it, and when there was silence he sang of the iniquity of\r\nthe King. And he foretold the onrush of the Zeedians, and the fall and the\r\nforgetting of Zaccarath, and the coming again of the desert to its own,\r\nand the playing about of little lion cubs where the courts of the palace\r\nhad stood.\r\n\r\n"Of what is he singing?" said a queen to a queen.\r\n\r\n"He is singing of everlasting Zaccarath."\r\n\r\nAs the singer ceased the assemblage beat listlessly on the floor, and the\r\nKing nodded to him, and he departed.\r\n\r\nWhen all the prophets had prophesied to them and all the singers sung,\r\nthat royal company arose and went to other chambers, leaving the hall of\r\nfestival to the pale and lonely dawn. And alone were left the lion-headed\r\ngods that were carven out of the walls; silent they stood, and their rocky\r\narms were folded. And shadows over their faces moved like curious thoughts\r\nas the torches flickered and the dull dawn crossed the fields. And the\r\ncolours began to change in the chandeliers.\r\n\r\nWhen the last lutanist fell asleep the birds began to sing.\r\n\r\nNever was greater splendour or a more famous hall. When the queens went\r\naway through the curtained door with all their diadems, it was as though\r\nthe stars should arise in their stations and troop together to the West at\r\nsunrise.\r\n\r\nAnd only the other day I found a stone that had undoubtedly been a part of\r\nZaccarath, it was three inches long and an inch broad; I saw the edge of\r\nit uncovered by the sand. I believe that only three other pieces have been\r\nfound like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one has seen Spring\'s blossom fall in London, and Summer appear and\r\nripen and decay, as it does early in cities, and one is in London still,\r\nthen, at some moment or another, the country places lift their flowery\r\nheads and call to one with an urgent, masterful clearness, upland behind\r\nupland in the twilight like to some heavenly choir arising rank on rank to\r\ncall a drunkard from his gambling-hell. No volume of traffic can drown the\r\nsound of it, no lure of London can weaken its appeal. Having heard it\r\none\'s fancy is gone, and evermore departed, to some coloured pebble agleam\r\nin a rural brook, and all that London can offer is swept from one\'s mind\r\nlike some suddenly smitten metropolitan Goliath.\r\n\r\nThe call is from afar both in leagues and years, for the hills that call\r\none are the hills that were, and their voices are the voices of long ago,\r\nwhen the elf-kings still had horns.\r\n\r\nI see them now, those hills of my infancy (for it is they that call), with\r\ntheir faces upturned to the purple twilight, and the faint diaphanous\r\nfigures of the fairies peering out from under the bracken to see if\r\nevening is come. I do not see upon their regal summits those desirable\r\nmansions, and highly desirable residences, which have lately been built\r\nfor gentlemen who would exchange customers for tenants.\r\n\r\nWhen the hills called I used to go to them by road, riding a bicycle. If\r\nyou go by train you miss the gradual approach, you do not cast off London\r\nlike an old forgiven sin, nor pass by little villages on the way that must\r\nhave some rumour of the hills; nor, wondering if they are still the same,\r\ncome at last upon the edge of their far-spread robes, and so on to their\r\nfeet, and see far off their holy, welcoming faces. In the train you see\r\nthem suddenly round a curve, and there they all are sitting in the sun.\r\n\r\nI imagine that as one penetrated out from some enormous forest of the\r\ntropics, the wild beasts would become fewer, the gloom would lighten, and\r\nthe horror of the place would slowly lift. Yet as one emerges nearer to\r\nthe edge of London, and nearer to the beautiful influence of the hills,\r\nthe houses become uglier, the streets viler, the gloom deepens, the errors\r\nof civilisation stand bare to the scorn of the fields.\r\n\r\nWhere ugliness reaches the height of its luxuriance, in the dense misery\r\nof the place, where one imagines the builder saying, "Here I culminate.\r\nLet us give thanks to Satan," there is a bridge of yellow brick, and\r\nthrough it, as through some gate of filigree silver opening on fairyland,\r\none passes into the country.\r\n\r\nTo left and right, as far as one can see, stretches that monstrous city;\r\nbefore one are the fields like an old, old song.\r\n\r\nThere is a field there that is full of king-cups. A stream runs through\r\nit, and along the stream is a little wood of osiers. There I used often to\r\nrest at the streams edge before my long journey to the hills.\r\n\r\nThere I used to forget London, street by street. Sometimes I picked a\r\nbunch of king-cups to show them to the hills.\r\n\r\nI often came there. At first I noticed nothing about the field except its\r\nbeauty and its peacefulness.\r\n\r\nBut the second time that I came I thought there was something ominous\r\nabout the field.\r\n\r\nDown there among the king-cups by the little shallow stream I felt that\r\nsomething terrible might happen in just such a place.\r\n\r\nI did not stay long there, because I thought that too much time spent in\r\nLondon had brought on these morbid fancies and I went on to the hills as\r\nfast as I could.\r\n\r\nI stayed for some days in the country air, and when I came back I went to\r\nthe field again to enjoy that peaceful spot before entering London. But\r\nthere was still something ominous among the osiers.\r\n\r\nA year elapsed before I went there again. I emerged from the shadow of\r\nLondon into the gleaming sun; the bright green grass and the king-cups\r\nwere flaming in the light, and the little stream was singing a happy song.\r\nBut the moment I stepped into the field my old uneasiness returned, and\r\nworse than before. It was as though the shadow was brooding there of some\r\ndreadful future thing and a year had brought it nearer.\r\n\r\nI reasoned that the exertion of bicycling might be bad for one, and that\r\nthe moment one rested this uneasiness might result.\r\n\r\nA little later I came back past the field by night, and the song of the\r\nstream in the hush attracted me down to it. And there the fancy came to me\r\nthat it would be a terribly cold place to be in the starlight, if for some\r\nreason one was hurt and could not get away.\r\n\r\nI knew a man who was minutely acquainted with the past history of that\r\nlocality, and him I asked if anything historical had ever happened in that\r\nfield. When he pressed me for my reason in asking him this, I said that\r\nthe field had seemed to me such a good place to hold a pageant in. But he\r\nsaid that nothing of any interest had ever occurred there, nothing at all.\r\n\r\nSo it was from the future that the field\'s terrible trouble came.\r\n\r\nFor three years off and on I made visits to the field, and every time more\r\nclearly it boded evil things, and my uneasiness grew more acute every time\r\nthat I was lured to go and rest among the cool green grass under the\r\nbeautiful osiers. Once to distract my thoughts I tried to gauge how fast\r\nthe stream was trickling, but I found myself wondering if it flowed faster\r\nthan blood.\r\n\r\nI felt that it would be a terrible place to go mad in, one would hear\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nAt last I went to a poet whom I knew, and woke him from huge dreams, and\r\nput before him the whole case of the field. He had not been out of London\r\nall that year, and he promised to come with me and look at the field, and\r\ntell me what was going to happen there. It was late in July when we went.\r\nThe pavement, the air, the houses and the dirt had been all baked dry by\r\nthe summer, the weary traffic dragged on, and on, and on, and Sleep\r\nspreading her wings soared up and floated from London and went to walk\r\nbeautifully in rural places.\r\n\r\nWhen the poet saw the field he was delighted, the flowers were out in\r\nmasses all along the stream, he went down to the little wood rejoicing. By\r\nthe side of the stream he stood and seemed very sad. Once or twice he\r\nlooked up and down it mournfully, then he bent and looked at the\r\nking-cups, first one and then another, very closely, and shaking his head.\r\n\r\nFor a long while he stood in silence, and all my old uneasiness returned,\r\nand my bodings for the future.\r\n\r\nAnd then I said, "What manner of field is it?"\r\n\r\nAnd he shook his head sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"It is a battlefield," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAY OF THE POLL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the town by the sea it was the day of the poll, and the poet regarded\r\nit sadly when he woke and saw the light of it coming in at his window\r\nbetween two small curtains of gauze. And the day of the poll was\r\nbeautifully bright; stray bird-songs came to the poet at the window; the\r\nair was crisp and wintry, but it was the blaze of sunlight that had\r\ndeceived the birds. He heard the sound of the sea that the moon led up the\r\nshore, dragging the months away over the pebbles and shingles and piling\r\nthem up with the years where the worn-out centuries lay; he saw the\r\nmajestic downs stand facing mightily south-wards; saw the smoke of the\r\ntown float up to their heavenly faces--column after column rose calmly\r\ninto the morning as house by house was waked by peering shafts of the\r\nsunlight and lit its fires for the day; column by column went up toward\r\nthe serene downs\' faces, and failed before they came there and hung all\r\nwhite over houses; and every one in the town was raving mad.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange thing that the poet did, for he hired the largest motor\r\nin the town and covered it with all the flags he could find, and set out\r\nto save an intelligence. And he presently found a man whose face was hot,\r\nwho shouted that the time was not far distant when a candidate, whom he\r\nnamed, would be returned at the head of the poll by a thumping majority.\r\nAnd by him the poet stopped and offered him a seat in the motor that was\r\ncovered with flags. When the man saw the flags that were on the motor, and\r\nthat it was the largest in the town, he got in. He said that his vote\r\nshould be given for that fiscal system that had made us what we are, in\r\norder that the poor man\'s food should not be taxed to make the rich man\r\nricher. Or else it was that he would give his vote for that system of\r\ntariff reform which should unite us closer to our colonies with ties that\r\nshould long endure, and give employment to all. But it was not to the\r\npolling-booth that the motor went, it passed it and left the town and came\r\nby a small white winding road to the very top of the downs. There the poet\r\ndismissed the car and let that wondering voter on to the grass and seated\r\nhimself on a rug. And for long the voter talked of those imperial\r\ntraditions that our forefathers had made for us and which he should uphold\r\nwith his vote, or else it was of a people oppressed by a feudal system\r\nthat was out of date and effete, and that should be ended or mended. But\r\nthe poet pointed out to him small, distant, wandering ships on the sunlit\r\nstrip of sea, and the birds far down below them, and the houses below the\r\nbirds, with the little columns of smoke that could not find the downs.\r\n\r\nAnd at first the voter cried for his polling-booth like a child; but after\r\na while he grew calmer, save when faint bursts of cheering came twittering\r\nup to the downs, when the voter would cry out bitterly against the\r\nmisgovernment of the Radical party, or else it was--I forget what the poet\r\ntold me--he extolled its splendid record.\r\n\r\n"See," said the poet, "these ancient beautiful things, the downs and the\r\nold-time houses and the morning, and the grey sea in the sunlight going\r\nmumbling round the world. And this is the place they have chosen to go man\r\nin!"\r\n\r\nAnd standing there with all broad England behind him, rolling northward,\r\ndown after down, and before him the glittering sea too far for the sound\r\nof the roar of it, there seemed to the voter to grow less important the\r\nquestions that troubled the town. Yet he was still angry.\r\n\r\n"Why did you bring me here?" he said again.\r\n\r\n"Because I grew lonely," said the poet, "when all the town went mad."\r\n\r\nThen he pointed out to the voter some old bent thorns, and showed him the\r\nway that a wind had blown for a million years, coming up at dawn from the\r\nsea; and he told him of the storms that visit the ships, and their names\r\nand whence they come, and the currents they drive afield, and the way that\r\nthe swallows go. And he spoke of the down where they sat, when the summer\r\ncame, and the flowers that were not yet, and the different butterflies,\r\nand about the bats and the swifts, and the thoughts in the heart of man.\r\nHe spoke of the aged windmill that stood on the down, and of how to\r\nchildren it seemed a strange old man who was only dead by day. And as he\r\nspoke, and as the sea-wind blew on that high and lonely place, there began\r\nto slip away from the voter\'s mind meaningless phrases that had crowded it\r\nlong--thumping majority--victory in the fight--terminological\r\ninexactitudes--and the smell of paraffin lamps dangling in heated\r\nschoolrooms, and quotations taken from ancient speeches because the words\r\nwere long. They fell away, though slowly, and slowly the voter saw a wider\r\nworld and the wonder of the sea. And the afternoon wore on, and the winter\r\nevening came, and the night fell, and all black grew the sea, and about\r\nthe time that the stars come blinking out to look upon our littleness, the\r\npolling-booth closed in the town.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back the turmoil was on the wane in the streets; night hid\r\nthe glare of the posters; and the tide, finding the noise abated and being\r\nat the flow, told an old tale that he had learned in his youth about the\r\ndeeps of the sea, the same which he had told to coastwise ships that\r\nbrought it to Babylon by the way of Euphrates before the doom of Troy.\r\n\r\nI blame my friend the poet, however lonely he was, for preventing this man\r\nfrom registering his vote (the duty of every citizen); but perhaps it\r\nmatters less, as it was a foregone conclusion, because the losing\r\ncandidate, either through poverty or sheer madness, had neglected to\r\nsubscribe to a single football club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNHAPPY BODY\r\n\r\n\r\n"Why do you not dance with us and rejoice with us?" they said to a certain\r\nbody. And then that body made the confession of its trouble. It said: "I\r\nam united with a fierce and violent soul, that is altogether tyrannous and\r\nwill not let me rest, and he drags me away from the dances of my kin to\r\nmake me toil at his detestable work; and he will not let me do the little\r\nthings, that would give pleasure to the folk I love, but only cares to\r\nplease posterity when he has done with me and left me to the worms; and\r\nall the while he makes absurd demands of affection from those that are\r\nnear to me, and is too proud even to notice any less than he demands, so\r\nthat those that should be kind to me all hate me." And the unhappy body\r\nburst into tears.\r\n\r\nAnd they said: "No sensible body cares for its soul. A soul is a little\r\nthing, and should not rule a body. You should drink and smoke more till he\r\nceases to trouble you." But the body only wept, and said, "Mine is a\r\nfearful soul. I have driven him away for a little while with drink. But he\r\nwill soon come back. Oh, he will soon come back!"\r\n\r\nAnd the body went to bed hoping to rest, for it was drowsy with drink. But\r\njust as sleep was near it, it looked up, and there was its soul sitting on\r\nthe windowsill, a misty blaze of light, and looking into the river.\r\n\r\n"Come," said the tyrannous soul, "and look into the street."\r\n\r\n"I have need of sleep," said the body.\r\n\r\n"But the street is a beautiful thing," the soul said vehemently; "a\r\nhundred of the people are dreaming there."\r\n\r\n"I am ill through want of rest," the body said.\r\n\r\n"That does not matter," the soul said to it. "There are millions like you\r\nin the earth, and millions more to go there. The people\'s dreams are\r\nwandering afield; they pass the seas and mountains of fa\xebry, threading the\r\nintricate passes led by their souls; they come to golden temples a-ring\r\nwith a thousand bells; they pass up steep streets lit by paper lanterns,\r\nwhere the doors are green and small; they know their way to witches\'\r\nchambers and castles of enchantment; they know the spell that brings them\r\nto the causeway along the ivory mountains--on one side looking downward\r\nthey behold the fields of their youth and on the other lie the radiant\r\nplains of the future. Arise and write down what the people dream."\r\n\r\n"What reward is there for me," said the body, "if I write down what you\r\nbid me?"\r\n\r\n"There is no reward," said the soul.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall sleep," said the body.\r\n\r\nAnd the soul began to hum an idle song sung by a young man in a fabulous\r\nland as he passed a golden city (where fiery sentinels stood), and knew\r\nthat his wife was within it, though as yet but a little child, and knew by\r\nprophecy that furious wars, not yet arisen in far and unknown mountains,\r\nshould roll above him with their dust and thirst before he ever came to\r\nthat city again--the young man sang it as he passed the gate, and was now\r\ndead with his wife a thousand years.\r\n\r\n"I cannot sleep for that abominable song," the body cried to the soul.\r\n\r\n"Then do as you are commanded," the soul replied. And wearily the body\r\ntook a pen again. Then the soul spoke merrily as he looked through the\r\nwindow. "There is a mountain lifting sheer above London, part crystal and\r\npart myst. Thither the dreamers go when the sound of the traffic has\r\nfallen. At first they scarcely dream because of the roar of it, but before\r\nmidnight it stops, and turns, and ebbs with all its wrecks. Then the\r\ndreamers arise and scale the shimmering mountain, and at its summit find\r\nthe galleons of dream. Thence some sail East, some West, some into the\r\nPast and some into the Future, for the galleons sail over the years as\r\nwell as over the spaces, but mostly they head for the Past and the olden\r\nharbours, for thither the sighs of men are mostly turned, and the\r\ndream-ships go before them, as the merchantmen before the continual\r\ntrade-winds go down the African coast. I see the galleons even now raise\r\nanchor after anchor; the stars flash by them; they slip out of the night;\r\ntheir prows go gleaming into the twilight of memory, and night soon lies\r\nfar off, a black cloud hanging low, and faintly spangled with stars, like\r\nthe harbour and shore of some low-lying land seen afar with its harbour\r\nlights."\r\n\r\nDream after dream that soul related as he sat there by the window. He told\r\nof tropical forests seen by unhappy men who could not escape from London,\r\nand never would--forests made suddenly wondrous by the song of some\r\npassing bird flying to unknown eyries and singing an unknown song. He saw\r\nthe old men lightly dancing to the tune of elfin pipes--beautiful dances\r\nwith fantastic maidens--all night on moonlit imaginary mountains; he heard\r\nfar off the music of glittering Springs; he saw the fairness of blossoms\r\nof apple and may thirty years fallen; he heard old voices--old tears came\r\nglistening back; Romance sat cloaked and crowned upon southern hills, and\r\nthe soul knew him.\r\n\r\nOne by one he told the dreams of all that slept in that street. Sometimes\r\nhe stopped to revile the body because it worked badly and slowly. Its\r\nchill fingers wrote as fast as they could, but the soul cared not for\r\nthat. And so the night wore on till the soul heard tinkling in Oriental\r\nskies far footfalls of the morning.\r\n\r\n"See now," said the soul, "the dawn that the dreamers dread. The sails of\r\nlight are paling on those unwreckable galleons; the mariners that steer\r\nthem slip back into fable and myth; that other sea the traffic is turning\r\nnow at its ebb, and is about to hide its pallid wrecks, and to come\r\nswinging back, with its tumult, at the flow. Already the sunlight flashes\r\nin the gulfs behind the east of the world; the gods have seen it from\r\ntheir palace of twilight that the built above the sunrise; they warm their\r\nhands at its glow as it streams through their gleaming arches, before it\r\nreaches the world; all the gods are there that have ever been, and all the\r\ngods that shall be; they sit there in the morning, chanting and praising\r\nMan."\r\n\r\n"I am numb and very cold for want of sleep," said the body.\r\n\r\n"You shall have centuries of sleep," said the soul, "but you must not\r\nsleep now, for I have seen deep meadows with purple flowers flaming tall\r\nand strange above the brilliant grass, and herds of pure white unicorns\r\nthat gambol there for joy, and a river running by with a glittering\r\ngalleon on it, all of gold, that goes from an unknown inland to an unknown\r\nisle of the sea to take a song from the King of Over-the-Hills to the\r\nQueen of Far-Away.\r\n\r\n"I will sing that song to you, and you shall write it down."\r\n\r\n"I have toiled for you for years," the body said. "Give me now but one\r\nnight\'s rest, for I am exceeding weary."\r\n\r\n"Oh, go and rest. I am tired of you. I am off," said the soul.\r\n\r\nAnd he arose and went, we know not whither. But the body they laid in the\r\nearth. And the next night at midnight the wraiths of the dead came\r\ndrifting from their tombs to felicitate that body.\r\n\r\n"You are free here, you know," they said to their new companion.\r\n\r\n"Now I can rest," said the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Dreamer\'s Palace, by \r\nLord Dunsany [Edward J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
